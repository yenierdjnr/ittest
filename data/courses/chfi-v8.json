series.\n\n3\n00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.670\nAdam thanks for joining us today.\n\n4\n00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.660\nCould you please give us a general\noverview of what we can expect from\n\n5\n00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.345\nthis series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:15.827\n&gt;&gt; Small.\n\n7\n00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Absolutely.\n\n8\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.640\nLet's talk about what we expect here for\nour, upcoming conversation is about CHFI.\n\n9\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.040\nIt's very exciting when\nwe talk about forensics,\n\n10\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.260\ndigital forensics in particular.\n\n11\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.730\nThe things we're gonna take a look at,\n\n12\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.740\nmaybe some high level\ntopics we're gonna cover.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.980\nThings like, what are hard drives and\nfile systems?\n\n14\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.700\nHow do we forensically examine them?\n\n15\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.620\nWhat is the chain of custody of evidence?\n\n16\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.670\nWhat does it mean to forensically examine\nand gather data using a sound methodology?\n\n17\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030\nWe're gonna detail what\nthat methodology is.\n\n18\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.480\nHow do we examine things like email?\n\n19\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.649\nWeb related services?\n\n20\n00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.413\nSo, web services and web systems,\nemail systems, law gathering and\n\n21\n00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:53.877\nnetwork forensics.\n\n22\n00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:57.882\nHow do we use common tools of the trade,\nthings like access to tool,\n\n23\n00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:00.151\naccess of the key forensics tool kit.\n\n24\n00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.590\nAnd case and oldie but a goody and a very,\nvery common tool what's steganography?\n\n25\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.880\nAnd what are we gonna do when we hide\nimages inside of other images or\n\n26\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.470\ndiscover that there and pulled them out.\n\n27\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.300\nSo to speak we're gonna take a look in\nall that, how do we do password cracking?\n\n28\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.060\nAnd somethings that may or may not be\ngender per say for the average individual.\n\n29\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.621\nWhen we think about investigation and\nforensics,\n\n30\n00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.307\nwe don't often think about system hacking,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:26.697\nBut we're gonna make the case for you and\n\n32\n00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:31.341\nI think persuasively that in order to be\ngood at being a systems investigator.\n\n33\n00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.533\nAt being a forensic investigator,\none of the most important things\n\n34\n00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.420\nyou need to understand how to\ndo is think like a hacker.\n\n35\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.860\nAnd as results,\nsome of the prerequisite knowledge and\n\n36\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.810\nthe things that we may be able to\nshow you, remind you, or teach you.\n\n37\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.360\nAnd or tell you that we've done another\nareas and then have you come back and\n\n38\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.100\ntake a look at in relation\nto the skills here are gonna\n\n39\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.870\nbe the subject of our conversation.\n\n40\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Adam, who would you say is\nthe intended audience for this CHFI?\n\n41\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Anybody who is looking, number one, to\ncertainly get into digital forensics and\n\n42\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330\nthe investigative process would\nbe a good candidate for this.\n\n43\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.810\nPeople that perhaps have a background\nwith things like security plus or\n\n44\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.780\nCASP from CompTIA, perhaps an SSCP\nfrom an ISE square perspective.\n\n45\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.630\nMaybe somebody who has maybe 18\nto 36 months, maybe even more,\n\n46\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.970\nexperience as a professional doing IT and\na security practitioner.\n\n47\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.536\nCertainly somebody who\nalready has their C-E-H or\n\n48\n00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:26.934\nis looking to gather those\nskills along the way.\n\n49\n00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:30.997\nWould be a good candidate for this kind of\nset of skills and ultimately this kind of\n\n50\n00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:34.369\nknowledge in terms of bringing\nthose skills back to the employer.\n\n51\n00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.451\nAnd helping them to then ultimately\ndo a better job of defending, but\n\n52\n00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:41.517\nalso understanding when a break-in occurs,\nhow to prevent it from happening again.\n\n53\n00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:45.277\n&gt;&gt; Well sounds great, now that we\nunderstand who the audience is and\n\n54\n00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:46.819\nwhat we can expect from the series.\n\n55\n00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.307\nCould you talk a little bit about\nthe exam itself give us maybe some\n\n56\n00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:51.497\ndetails about that.\n\n57\n00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:55.037\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if we can go to my machine\nactually, we've got all that teed up for\n\n58\n00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:56.257\nyou right there.\n\n59\n00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:57.547\nThere we go, outstanding.\n\n60\n00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:02.237\nSo you can see all I've done is gone\nout to the EC council page for CHFI and\n\n61\n00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:04.164\nwe can go ahead and\nright there underneath.\n\n62\n00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:07.164\nCHFI down towards the bottom,\nwe see about the exam.\n\n63\n00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:11.626\nThe exam details currently sits at\n150 questions, passing score 70%.\n\n64\n00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:14.170\nYou do the math,\nyou could figure out what you need there.\n\n65\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350\nAnd then of course, four hours in\noverall duration for the exam.\n\n66\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.620\nSo a little bit longer than some\nof the traditional exams we see.\n\n67\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910\nExams don't tend to be quite as long\ncertainly Microsoft exams are not usually\n\n68\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.150\nquite as long, but some of the more\nheavy duty and extended exams.\n\n69\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.220\nWill certainly be at the four\nhour mark and above.\n\n70\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.790\nIt is multiple choice format\nas you could see there.\n\n71\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.330\nIt does say deliver\nthrough ECC exam portal.\n\n72\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.590\nBut you can also actually take that and\ninteract with that through Pearson VUE.\n\n73\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.335\nAnd we can actually\nregister at Pearson VUE.\n\n74\n00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:46.395\nSo when you wanna go in and\nget ready to actually take the exam,\n\n75\n00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.665\nas I'm sure you're gonna wanna do at some\npoint, you can go over to Pearson VUE.\n\n76\n00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:52.505\nRemember these days,\nPearson VUE does the online testing for\n\n77\n00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:53.865\njust about every major vendor.\n\n78\n00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.317\nThey do Microsoft's exams, they do Cisco,\n\n79\n00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:59.117\nthey do VMware, they do most of\nthe major vendors out there.\n\n80\n00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:01.937\nSo, no surprise they would\ndo EC Council as well.\n\n81\n00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:02.987\nOne thing to consider and\n\n82\n00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:06.707\nbe aware of, a lot of us may have\ncertifications from multiple vendors.\n\n83\n00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:09.127\nA lot of you May have them as well.\n\n84\n00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:14.645\nAnd if you have an account for let's say\nVMware or Cisco or Microsoft with Pearson.\n\n85\n00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:18.172\nYou're gonna have to create a separate one\nfor each of those vendors and obviously,\n\n86\n00:04:18.172 --> 00:04:20.430\nyou'll need a separate one for\nEC-Council as well.\n\n87\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.210\nSo even though you may\nalready be a customer so\n\n88\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.600\nto speak of Pearson you're gonna have to\ngo in and go through the process again.\n\n89\n00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.807\nSo you'll come into the Pearson website,\nfind the vendor list,\n\n90\n00:04:28.807 --> 00:04:32.437\nlook up EC-Council follow the instructions\nhere about how to register.\n\n91\n00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:35.257\nOne thing to keep in mind that when\nyou're going through and preparing for\n\n92\n00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:37.179\nany EC-Council exam,\nregardless of what it is.\n\n93\n00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:41.412\nThat there usually is a process that you\nhave to engage directly with EC Council to\n\n94\n00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:41.920\nfollow.\n\n95\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.620\nIn terms of validating that you're\nauthorized to take the exam,\n\n96\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.540\nthere's usually an NDA of some kind or\na responsibility\n\n97\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.370\nform you need to fill out to certify\nyou're not gonna use the skills.\n\n98\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.140\nThat we normally will show you\nhow to use for evil rather for\n\n99\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.110\ngood as I know you all will, right?\n\n100\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.435\nAnd so\nyou have to contact EC- Council directly.\n\n101\n00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:03.940\nECCouncil.org real simple to do follow\nthe instructions they may have there for\n\n102\n00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.120\nany one of their exams.\n\n103\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.160\nThere may be an application fee, there may\nbe a need for you to send in a resume.\n\n104\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.460\nThere's different requirements\ndepending on what it is.\n\n105\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.510\nAnd then once you've done that,\nyou're gonna get a validation code.\n\n106\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.720\nEssentially verification code, a voucher,\nis what they usually refer to it as.\n\n107\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.430\nThat's gonna give you the ability to come\nback to Pearson, apply, present that code,\n\n108\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.360\nand be validated for\nactually the ability to sit for the exam.\n\n109\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.890\nBecause without that code\nPearson VUE cannot register you\n\n110\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.750\nbecause EC-Council will not acknowledge\nyou as an authorized test taker.\n\n111\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.900\nSo just something to consider and be\naware of, but not a complicated process.\n\n112\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.350\nIt's actually very straightforward.\n\n113\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that sounds fantastic.\n\n114\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.050\nAnd if that sounds like something\nthat you might be interested in,\n\n115\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.235\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in our upcoming series.\n\n116\n00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:47.324\n[SOUND]\n\n",

nefarious,\nnotorious Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.431\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.199\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were going to say\n\n12\n00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.187\nNosferatu for a minute.\n\n13\n00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:37.800\nVery good, thank you, very good.\n\n14\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.450\nAlways glad to be back

spend some time, as\nDaniel was very exuberant in explaining,\n\n17\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.478\nit's the happiest I've heard\nyou being in some time.\n\n18\n00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:56.020\nTalk about CHFI a little bit,\nso the idea is\n\n19\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.710\nof what forensics investigation may mean,\nhow we compare that, contrast that,\n\n20\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.856\ncombine that a little\nbit with some hacking.\n\n21\n00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:08.350\nWe're gonna talk a bit about how\nwe figure out what's going on\n\n22\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.880\ninside of a computer or\na computer system when the bad actors,\n\n23\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.920\nthe people that we call threat actors\nmay actually be up to no good.\n\n24\n00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.272\nYou know, we've talked a lot about how\nyou deal with those kinds of issues in\n\n25\n00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:23.333\nthe CEH set of discussions\nthat I had some time back and\n\n26\n00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.230\nencourage you to take a look at those\nif you haven't had a chance to.\n\n27\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.103\nIt's really almost like\na prereq part one if you will,\n\n28\n00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:32.106\nto what we're gonna talk about here.\n\n29\n00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:34.815\nDaniel and I were having a great\nconversation before we got\n\n30\n00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:36.418\nstarted with you this afternoon,\n\n31\n00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:40.470\ntalked a bit about some of the stuff he's\nbeen up to while I haven't been here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.290\nAnd we talked a little\nbit about pre-reqs and\n\n33\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.130\nthe whole idea of some\nbackground knowledge, right?\n\n34\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.360\nTo be able to know certain things.\n\n35\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.660\nAnd so I wouldn't say you\nhave to be CEH certified.\n\n36\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.050\nI wouldn't say you have to understand and\nknow what a CEH certified ethical\n\n37\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.320\nhacker does and is, in order to study and\nunderstand and go through the material for\n\n38\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.450\nhacking forensic investigation and\ncertainly to understand\n\n39\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.640\nhow to be successful if you choose\nto take the CHFI exam at some point.\n\n40\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.035\nBut I wouldn't say also that it would\nbe a bad investment of your time.\n\n41\n00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:12.570\nIn other words, what I'm suggesting is,\nit's good to have a lot of\n\n42\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.787\nthe knowledge that we talked about in this\nother area and in general across a lot of\n\n43\n00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:19.909\nthe security courses that we\nspend time on here at ITProTV.\n\n44\n00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.972\nBecause it really forms that foundation or\nplatform knowledge that is gonna be so\n\n45\n00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:26.315\nbeneficial to you in so\nmany different areas.\n\n46\n00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:29.489\nAnd as we start to go through material,\nI think you´ll begin to see pretty quickly\n\n47\n00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.045\nwhat we're talking about with\nregards to some of that stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:33.675\nSo we'll see how that goes and\n\n49\n00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.817\nobviously encourage you along the way\nto chat with us, ask us questions,\n\n50\n00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:41.037\ncall Daniel funny names, whatever you\nwanna do, it's perfectly acceptable.\n\n51\n00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:43.167\nIt does not matter,\nbecause he's prepared for everything.\n\n52\n00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:44.717\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I resemble that remark sir.\n\n53\n00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.917\n&gt;&gt; You very well may by the time\nwe're done, we'll see how that goes.\n\n54\n00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk a bit about computer\n\n55\n00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:50.637\nforensics in today's world.\n\n56\n00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:55.567\nYou know, the idea behind forensics is\nactually a very old one by comparison with\n\n57\n00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:58.457\ncertain things we talked about\nin information security today.\n\n58\n00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.890\nWe'll talk a bit about\nthe history of forensics.\n\n59\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.110\nDo you know when forensics more or\nless as a thought process got its start?\n\n60\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.500\nModern day forensics?\n\n61\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.470\n&gt;&gt; I would think it would probably be\nnear the industrialized revolution.\n\n62\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.570\nThat's were, my guess, I don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.510\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually more or\nless exactly where we would think and\n\n64\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.580\nwhere we would look to.\n\n65\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.798\nYour middle to late 1800s when we started\ntalking about things like blood typing,\n\n66\n00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:24.262\nand fingerprints, and awareness is\nsome of the things that lead us more\n\n67\n00:03:24.262 --> 00:03:26.475\nbroadly to forensics and forensic science.\n\n68\n00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:30.478\nNot specifically dealing with computers,\ncuz obviously, clearly,\n\n69\n00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:35.025\ncomputer forensics is a very modern day,\nof the moment kind of thought process.\n\n70\n00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:37.810\nLast 20, 30 years, give or\ntake, maybe a little longer,\n\n71\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.335\ndepending on what we're talking about\ncuz you obviously have to have computers\n\n72\n00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.195\nbefore we can really talk about\nfocusing on them forensically.\n\n73\n00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:48.005\nBut more broadly, the idea of\nforensic science has been around for\n\n74\n00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:50.345\nwell over 100 years at this point.\n\n75\n00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.625\nMaybe 150 years in one form or another.\n\n76\n00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:56.050\nSo not something that's actually so\nstartlingly new.\n\n77\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.280\nBut as we take that broad thought process,\napply it to some of the things we talked\n\n78\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.580\nabout with regards to computers, it\nbecomes a little bit more relevant to us.\n\n79\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.650\nAnd a little bit more timely.\n\n80\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.670\nIf you go back 20, 30, 40 years and\n\n81\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.480\nthink about what we were doing and\nhow we were doing it.\n\n82\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.610\nWhen I went to school, aeons ago, right?\n\n83\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.390\nDecades.\n\n84\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.300\nMillennium ago.\n\n85\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.070\nWhen I went to school.\n\n86\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.020\nWhen I was in high school, when I was\nin grade school, when I was in college.\n\n87\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.290\nDepending on what error we were talking\nabout, computers certainly existed but\n\n88\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.000\na personal computer like the ones\nDaniel and I are using here and\n\n89\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.030\nany of the ones you have at home didn't\nreally exist in the traditional sense.\n\n90\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.170\nI used a word processor, which was\na glorified typewriter, with one or\n\n91\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.150\ntwo lines of text on an LCD screen coming\nout of college or going into college,\n\n92\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.890\ncoming out of college,\ngoing into graduate school.\n\n93\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.410\nThat was state of the art\ntechnology at that point in time.\n\n94\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.160\nYou know, when I was in grade school,\nyou had manual typewriters.\n\n95\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.540\nI mean, that's what you had.\n\n96\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.860\nAnd they also had chisels and stones.\n\n97\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.999\nYou could do the whole,\nyou know, Fred Flintstone thing.\n\n98\n00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.623\n&gt;&gt; Adam knows the IBM Selectrics,\nI guarantee it.\n\n99\n00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:57.118\n&gt;&gt; Adam knows, about all that stuff,\n\n100\n00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:01.026\nI actually had the pleasure\nof building my own TRS 80,\n\n101\n00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:06.530\nthose of you that may be up on geek trivia\nand lore used to call them trash 80s.\n\n102\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.390\nBut if you remember, Texas Instruments,\n\n103\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.390\nRadioShack, great set of companies\nyears and years and years ago.\n\n104\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.770\nNo longer around, RadioShack's gone, and\nyou know gone the way of the dinosaur.\n\n105\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.970\nBut Texas Instruments built,\nback in the day,\n\n106\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.030\none of the first home computer kits\nyou could actually buy, go out and\n\n107\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.470\nessentially build for\nyourself was called the TRS 80.\n\n108\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.990\nAnd I actually built one of those and\n\n109\n00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.940\nlived to tell about it which\nis no small feat considering.\n\n110\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.260\n&gt;&gt; He is still using it\nto this day [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.100\n&gt;&gt; You know I actually am.\n\n112\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.490\nIt's sitting at the heart of what\nI'm using to actually do my show\n\n113\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.340\nnotes for you.\n\n114\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.200\nBelieve it not,\nit's just dressed up nicely.\n\n115\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.860\nBut if, you can't see it cuz\nwe don't have the overhead on.\n\n116\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.150\nBut my computer's still being\nheld together by electrical tape.\n\n117\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.580\nJust to point that out on the side.\n\n118\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.670\nSo we're not that far removed\nfrom this kind of technology.\n\n119\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.470\nYou know, back in that time period,\nwhen we would have talked about computer\n\n120\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.470\nforensics, we certainly could have talked\nabout the concept and we could have\n\n121\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.280\napproximated the ability to be able to do\ncertain things like we talk about today.\n\n122\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.070\nBut it would have been nowhere near as\nadvanced as what we're gonna talk about\n\n123\n00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.740\nover our coming episodes and\nshows we go through the material.\n\n124\n00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.840\nIt would have been very basic,\nwe would have looked at computers but\n\n125\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.055\ncomputers would have been mainframe and\nmidframe systems.\n\n126\n00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:19.130\nWe'd have been talking about kind\nof things you see in old movies,\n\n127\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.330\nyou know from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s\nwhere you saw these massive towers with\n\n128\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.320\nthe big quarter inch,\nhalf inch, inch reel tapes.\n\n129\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.556\nYou would have seen those and you\ncertainly could have done forensics work\n\n130\n00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:34.643\non them but it would have looked very\ndifferent from what we see today.\n\n131\n00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:36.880\nAnd you wouldn't have had the concerns and\n\n132\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.050\nissues we're going to address\nwith regards to things like,\n\n133\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.715\nonce in the memory of a system and\nhow do we pull that system memory out,\n\n134\n00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:47.592\nyou would have gone right to the mainframe\nsystem and dealt with it there.\n\n135\n00:06:47.592 --> 00:06:48.628\nWe still have those issues,\n\n136\n00:06:48.628 --> 00:06:51.840\nbut you wouldn't have worried about them\non the front end systems you were using.\n\n137\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.576\nThey're essentially\njust dumb terminals and\n\n138\n00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:55.540\nyou wouldn't really see\nany information in there.\n\n139\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.218\nIt was really just a mirror that would\nreflect back whatever was going on from\n\n140\n00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:02.730\nthe back end, for I would call that\nfront and back end processing.\n\n141\n00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.800\nAnd the front end processing was just a\ndumb box and so it's very different today.\n\n142\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.570\nWhen we think about forensic science\nwe think overall as I was suggesting\n\n143\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.200\nabout the idea of applying this idea\nof science overall to the search for\n\n144\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.640\ntruth, right, the search for\nunderstanding, the search for\n\n145\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.060\nknowledge, with regards to whatever\nsystems we may be talking about.\n\n146\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.130\nTalked a bit about\nthe concepts of the history.\n\n147\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.630\nThe objectives of computer forensics\nare also really important for\n\n148\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.890\nus to think about.\n\n149\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.440\nWhat if I asked you, Daniel,\njust off the top of your head.\n\n150\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.990\nIf I asked you what do you think is\nthe main objective of computer forensics,\n\n151\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.810\nwhat do you think, what do we tell\nthe nice people out there in our audience.\n\n152\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.980\n&gt;&gt; If I had to put a definition on it I\nguess on the spot like Adam is doing to me\n\n153\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.770\nright now, I would say it is the-\n&gt;&gt; No pressure by the way, no pressure.\n\n154\n00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no, I'll get it completely\nwrong and he'll get to make fun of me.\n\n155\n00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:52.350\nIt would be the gathering of\ninformation for the purposes of\n\n156\n00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.346\ndiscovering the nefarious things\nthat have happened to a system.\n\n157\n00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:58.510\n&gt;&gt; Actually not a bad way\nof thinking about it.\n\n158\n00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.336\nI would maybe just use\nslightly different language.\n\n159\n00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:03.329\nBut in general, Daniel spot on.\n\n160\n00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:07.180\nThe idea of overall going through,\nexamining, right?\n\n161\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.990\nAnd let's just break it down,\ncuz it's a very broad concept.\n\n162\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.050\nYou say, well, let's gather information.\n\n163\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.420\nLet's look at the nefarious\nthings that have gone on.\n\n164\n00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.620\nSo let's look at the bad, the evil.\n\n165\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.970\nThe concerning things that have happened.\n\n166\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.780\nBut let's think about breaking it down,\nright?\n\n167\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.660\nSo when we gather information,\nare we analyzing,\n\n168\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.110\nare we examining, recovering, probing for\n\n169\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.250\ninformation, gathering it, pulling it off,\ndoing so in a forensically sound manner?\n\n170\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.420\nAbsolutely.\n\n171\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.710\nAre we gonna gather that evidence,\nstore it?\n\n172\n00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.080\nAnd we'll get into more of\nhow to do this later on.\n\n173\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.380\nStore it in such a way,\nmanage it in such a way that we\n\n174\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.720\nare always focused on the integrity of the\ninformation, making sure the information\n\n175\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.080\nhas not been changed or modified\nwithout our knowledge and our consent.\n\n176\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.940\nSo if we have to present that\ninformation in a court of\n\n177\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.560\nlaw at some point down the road,\nwe have the capability to do so.\n\n178\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.320\nAbsolutely, we gotta think\nabout that kinda stuff.\n\n179\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.010\nSo Daniel's absolutely right when\nhe says yeah, let's get in there.\n\n180\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.330\nLet's see what went wrong.\n\n181\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.610\nLet's get evidence.\n\n182\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.060\nLet's get it off the system.\n\n183\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.770\nBut we gotta make sure we understand\nthat we don't just go in there,\n\n184\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.210\ngrab everything, and\nthen run away with it.\n\n185\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.280\nThere's very specific methodology,\n\n186\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.900\nvery specific focus that\nthe forensic investigator,\n\n187\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.070\nthe security professional that does\nforensics work has to bring to the table.\n\n188\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.160\nWe have to think about what\nthat methodology may be.\n\n189\n00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.050\nWe're gonna obviously define that\nthroughout our conversations.\n\n190\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.370\n&gt;&gt; Adam, I've got a quick question.\n\n191\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.590\nAnd when it comes to security forensics\nproperly, I guess our security forensics\n\n192\n00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:36.140\nproper, would we say that we only engage\nin forensics when we feel that a crime has\n\n193\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.420\nbeen committed or does forensics also get\nused in maybe accidental things as well?\n\n194\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.730\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a very good question.\n\n195\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.350\nSo, Daniel asked, right?\n\n196\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.470\nReally, the pivotal question\nthat we have to answer which is,\n\n197\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.610\nis there ever a bad time\nto engage in forensics?\n\n198\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.290\nNumber one and number two if there is,\nunder what circumstances?\n\n199\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:55.960\nFor what reason?\n\n200\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.720\nAnd if there's not, then,\nwhat is the end game?\n\n201\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.160\nWhat do we looking for, right?\n\n202\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.910\nAnd it's a great way to really think about\nthis conversation holistically because\n\n203\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.480\nthe answer is, you again will set it,\nalthough he kinda set it and\n\n204\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.330\npass right by it.\n\n205\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.560\nBut he said, hey did we just only do\nit when there's been attack or we\n\n206\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.550\nthink there's something wrong or can we do\nit in other circumstances to other ends.\n\n207\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.280\nA lot of the times, we don't necessarily\nknow that there's been an attack, right?\n\n208\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.340\nWe may think that's something has gone\nwrong but we don't have clear and\n\n209\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.470\nequivocal evidence.\n\n210\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.730\nAnd so as a result, forensic examination\nis gonna help to establish what may or\n\n211\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.830\nmay not have happened.\n\n212\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.030\nThere are many cases many times as you\npointed out where, you it's unequivocal.\n\n213\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.950\nI walked in and where my computer was,\nthere's basically a smoking ruin, right?\n\n214\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.640\nSo I know something went wrong.\n\n215\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.550\nNow we gotta figure out what that is.\n\n216\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.950\nSo it may be either or.\n\n217\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.360\nIn many cases it's yeah let's go in there,\npost event right?\n\n218\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.780\nAnd let's reactively examine,\nbut sometimes we may not have\n\n219\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.850\nevidence that's unequivocal that points\nus to the fact that that occurred.\n\n220\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.820\nSo let's going in there,\nlet's use sound forensic procedures.\n\n221\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:04.590\nLet's understand what did happen,\nthen we can establish and unequivocally\n\n222\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.630\nfigure out and authoritatively\nsay what did and did not occur.\n\n223\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.130\nWhat we don't wanna do\nis make bad choices and\n\n224\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.140\nmake bad decisions based on\nincomplete understanding of facts.\n\n225\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.220\nAnd so forensics helps us to\nestablish what those facts are.\n\n226\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.060\nThat becomes a very important\nthought process for us.\n\n227\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.310\nSo it's actually a very great question.\n\n228\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.440\nBecause it leads us in theory, really to\nthe benefits of what forensics helps us to\n\n229\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.620\ndo, which is to understand\nsituational awareness, make it apply\n\n230\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.630\nto a system in such a way that we paint\na picture as to what's gone on, right?\n\n231\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.270\nSo hypothetically, let's say we walk into\nour office Monday morning, been away all\n\n232\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.960\nweekend Come in and while everything\nlooks normal, we're not 100% sure.\n\n233\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.780\nThere's just some sort of thing,\nthat unsettleness that we have, right,\n\n234\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.390\nthat sometimes we get.\n\n235\n00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.290\nAnd my wife calls it the sixth sense,\nright, or spidey sense we have kids.\n\n236\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.490\nAnd when you have kids,\n\n237\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.690\nespecially if you have young kids,\nyou develop this really quickly\n\n238\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.770\nbecause you begin to understand that\nthings are essentially baselined, right?\n\n239\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.400\nKid acts a certain way, is a certain way,\nbehaves a certain way, and\n\n240\n00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.400\nbefore they even know it themselves,\nright?\n\n241\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.390\nYou kind of have a sense\nthat things aren't right.\n\n242\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.130\nAnd it's the same concept with\nanything we talked about.\n\n243\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.230\nUse the computer on a regular basis, you\nhave a sense when something's not right.\n\n244\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.210\nAnd it's that thought process\nthat as an investigator\n\n245\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.120\nwe wanna bring to the table, right?\n\n246\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.530\nNow remember, we may not be a part of\nthat world on a regular basis, right?\n\n247\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.540\nYou may bet called in as\nan investigator and be asked to\n\n248\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.520\nexamine a system forensically or engage in\na forensic thought process around one or\n\n249\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.490\nmore systems but you might not be\ndirectly involved with that company,\n\n250\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.630\nmay never have actually\nseen anything there.\n\n251\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.660\nThis happens all the time.\n\n252\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.690\nI do a lot of this kind of work within\nfour customers and as a result,\n\n253\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.430\nyou always spend a lot of time in other\nplaces doing things to another people's\n\n254\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.520\nsystem that I wouldn't normally\nunder any circumstances do.\n\n255\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.720\nI know my own system really well,\nbut I may not know yours.\n\n256\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.260\nBut I know something equally important,\nI know how to figure out what is and\n\n257\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.010\nis not going on in your system.\n\n258\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.500\nWhat is and is not normal based\non sound forensic procedures and\n\n259\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.610\nthough processes, right?\n\n260\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.600\nAnd so the key benefit for us is really to\nunderstand how to establish a baseline.\n\n261\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.130\nHow to understand what did or\nhas occurred, what did occur what has\n\n262\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.830\noccurred, and document that in such a way\nthat it allows us to authoritatively say,\n\n263\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.380\nhey, by the way, this may or may not\nbe of interest to us, but guess what?\n\n264\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.090\nWe've got to know that\nthese things are going on.\n\n265\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.420\nLet me show you one\nexample of what I mean.\n\n266\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.080\nCan we go to my machine here for\njust a minute if you don't mind.\n\n267\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.110\nAnd what I'm gonna do here,\nthere we go, look at that.\n\n268\n00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.925\nI'm looking down and.\n\n269\n00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:40.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's magic, I tell you.\n\n270\n00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:42.830\n[CROSSTALK] There is magic\non that box on the wall.\n\n271\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.170\nIt is just unbelievable\nwith that kind of stuff.\n\n272\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.005\n&gt;&gt; I'm just a cave man, [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:13:47.005 --> 00:13:50.113\n&gt;&gt; Listen, I've been accused of\nbeing in the end of fall before,\n\n274\n00:13:50.113 --> 00:13:51.715\nit wouldn't be the first time.\n\n275\n00:13:51.715 --> 00:13:56.750\nSo, but let's take a look at\nsomething here, so what wanna do is,\n\n276\n00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:03.030\nlet me do it this way and just open\nup another run line really quick.\n\n277\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.550\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n278\n00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.730\nso, you're in here in our command prompt,\nright?\n\n279\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.640\nYou can go through and we could actually\ndo quite a bit of forensic examination,\n\n280\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.450\nforensic work, forensic analysis using\neveryday common built-in tools, right?\n\n281\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.160\nI mean, a lot of people hear about\nthis concept, talk to me about this,\n\n282\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.190\nyou do this crazy, off in the corner\nkinda stuff, you gotta be in a lab to do.\n\n283\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.870\nAnd there's no way that you could tell me\nyou could understand what's going on on\n\n284\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.025\na machine, just, is using normal tools,\n\n285\n00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:35.361\nnothing could be farther\nfrom the truth ,right?\n\n286\n00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:37.285\nSo you are using a command\nprompt in windows,\n\n287\n00:14:37.285 --> 00:14:40.895\nI mean this is not magic,this is\njust standard inbuilt stuff,right?\n\n288\n00:14:40.895 --> 00:14:43.215\nWe could do all sorts of stuff,\nI mean common stuff that we know.\n\n289\n00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:46.515\nWe can obviously go out,\nwe can do an IP config statement here,\n\n290\n00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:49.360\nlook at IP information, Is that important?\n\n291\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:49.990\nAbsolutely.\n\n292\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.150\nIf somebody's messed around with our\nIP configuration, if they've sent us to\n\n293\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.200\nanother DHCP server or another DNS server,\nthat is not controlled by the organization\n\n294\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.350\nto execute some sort of either\nman in the middle or spoof or\n\n295\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.280\nmasquerade attack or any of those kind of\nthings, we may seem evidence of it here.\n\n296\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.090\nYour people often overlook\nthe common sense and\n\n297\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.630\nstuff that's in front of them, right?\n\n298\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.320\nIt's so obvious,\nthere's no way that could be important.\n\n299\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.240\nWhat's that gonna tell us?\n\n300\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.100\nWell, it's gonna tell us a lot, right?\n\n301\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.700\nJust understanding the difference\nbetween ipconfig, ipconfig all, and\n\n302\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.350\nipconfig display DNS would be helpful.\n\n303\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.930\nJust three commands that while\nmany of us probably know.\n\n304\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.950\nWhen was the last time you used it, right?\n\n305\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.259\nAnd I talk to my customers and my\nstudents about this all the time, right?\n\n306\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.310\nWhenever you don't know something and\n\n307\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.750\nthere's quite a lot of things\nthat you may not know.\n\n308\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.490\nHonestly, all kidding aside you just\nmay not be comfortable with this.\n\n309\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.130\nYou know sometimes,\nI'll throw out a command in a class or\n\n310\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.350\nI'm talking to a customer,\nI'm on site working.\n\n311\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.200\nAnd I'll say, hey just quickly\ntype that or do that for me.\n\n312\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.031\nAnd somebody looks at you kind of funny\nthey just don't really know what you're\n\n313\n00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:51.631\ntalking about.\n\n314\n00:15:51.631 --> 00:15:53.623\nI always number one,\ntry to stop take the time to explain.\n\n315\n00:15:53.623 --> 00:15:56.880\nBut number two I say listen,\nhere's the deal.\n\n316\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.154\nYou may never had this before but\nguess what,all you gotta do and\n\n317\n00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:02.880\nit's not 100% guarantee by the way, right?\n\n318\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.400\nBecause not everything is documented with\na help file but almost everything is.\n\n319\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.430\nAll you have to do typically Command,\nspace,\n\n320\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.980\nforward slash, question mark or\nspace question mark.\n\n321\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.560\nCouple of different ways to get to it.\n\n322\n00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.700\nWe call these man files help\nfiles in a Linux Unix, right?\n\n323\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.966\nDepending on who you're talking to or\nwhat you're doing,\n\n324\n00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:22.426\nWindows we just call them help files.\n\n325\n00:16:22.426 --> 00:16:23.487\nWe don't actually call much for\n\n326\n00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:25.616\nanything in Windows cuz most\npeople don't bother to read them.\n\n327\n00:16:25.616 --> 00:16:29.318\nBut the reality is if you do something\nlike this you're going to a get a file\n\n328\n00:16:29.318 --> 00:16:33.401\nthat's going to help you hence the name\nright, to understand a little bit more.\n\n329\n00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:35.907\nAnd if we just scroll up a little\nbit because cuz sometimes there's\n\n330\n00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:36.460\na lot to that.\n\n331\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.290\nEven though you may go down to\nthe bottom you got to scroll back up.\n\n332\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.380\nI did this in class once.\n\n333\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.480\nI'm like yeah and I start rattling off\nthe command and explain everything.\n\n334\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.440\nAnd everybody's just looking at me because\nI told you I walk around I never pay\n\n335\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.260\nattention to what's on\nthe screen behind me.\n\n336\n00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.020\nOr I'll be like, hey, type that and\nthen I'll start talking.\n\n337\n00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.730\nAnd then they're all like, Mr.\nGordon, Mr. Gordon, right.\n\n338\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.413\nDon't see anything, what are you doing?\n\n339\n00:16:57.413 --> 00:16:58.060\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n340\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.470\nI forgot that it had\nscrolled all the way down.\n\n341\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.220\nSo it's like there's nothing there.\n\n342\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.130\nI said well, just scroll up and\nyou'll see everything right there.\n\n343\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.560\nAnd so when you scroll up,\n\n344\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.170\nyou can see that all the switches we\nwere just talking about are there.\n\n345\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.182\nAnd I mention, /flushdns, I didn't mention\nthat, but I did talk about /displaydns,\n\n346\n00:17:14.182 --> 00:17:16.880\n/flushdns the exact\nopposite of that command.\n\n347\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.900\nBut another one people often overlook,\n/registerdns.\n\n348\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.660\nWhich is used on the hacking\nside to be able to go in and\n\n349\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.670\nmodify DNS registrations.\n\n350\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.870\nPeople often forget about\nthe fact we have a host file and\n\n351\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.950\nan LM host file locally on the machine.\n\n352\n00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.820\nSo we may go in, employees on the DNS\nentries by modifying the host file.\n\n353\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.730\nThese are all things we would\nstart to think about and\n\n354\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.910\nlook at with regards to name registration,\nname resolution.\n\n355\n00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.450\nJust one small piece of\na much bigger puzzle and\n\n356\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.860\nwe have to think about\ngathering all that information.\n\n357\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam, you make a great point.\n\n358\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.740\nYou talk about-\n&gt;&gt; I always make great points.\n\n359\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he does.\n&gt;&gt; It's not unusual.\n\n360\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.692\n&gt;&gt; He's an amazing man.\n\n361\n00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:54.930\n[LAUGH] It's that what he's talking about\nis we have these everyday tools that\n\n362\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.210\nany average user probably is aware\nof at least in some sense and\n\n363\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.890\nmaybe even know how to\nuse it a little bit.\n\n364\n00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.440\nBut the difference between just\na standard computer user and\n\n365\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.230\nsomeone, at least in my estimation, you\nsee this back in the 70s and the 80s and\n\n366\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.616\nthings of that nature, is there are people\nthat, they want to read the help files.\n\n367\n00:18:12.616 --> 00:18:16.385\nThey wanted to go to through every\nsingle way in which you could use it\n\n368\n00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:17.305\nto see how it worked.\n\n369\n00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:20.485\nAnd then, see how they can get it to work.\n\n370\n00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:23.125\nMaybe not how it was designed to work,\nbut how they can make it work.\n\n371\n00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.365\nAnd that's the mindset that you'll\nsee a lot in people that want,\n\n372\n00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:26.935\nor are interested in security.\n\n373\n00:18:26.935 --> 00:18:28.265\nI want to see what I can do with it.\n\n374\n00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:32.575\nI want to see how I can utilize\nthis tool in a way that maybe\n\n375\n00:18:32.575 --> 00:18:34.225\nthe average person would\nnot have thought of.\n\n376\n00:18:34.225 --> 00:18:35.365\nAnd that's what you're talking about,\nAdam,\n\n377\n00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:39.310\nwhere, there's no way you can\nuse these built-in tools for\n\n378\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.640\ncomputer forensics, well yeah, you can.\n\n379\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, no doubt about it,\nabsolutely can.\n\n380\n00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.170\nDid you plug in your machine,\nare you gonna be able to display up there?\n\n381\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:47.790\n&gt;&gt; I am not plugged in.\n\n382\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no, no big deal,\nI just wanted to know.\n\n383\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.270\nThat way so when I go to you and say hey,\n\n384\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.800\ncan you show that while I'm talking-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.490\n&gt;&gt; And nothing happens,\n\n386\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.830\nlike there is now,\nI'll know why this is exactly what we get.\n\n387\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.290\nAll right, so I'm gonna put something\nup in a minute that reinforces what\n\n388\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.260\nDaniel said.\n\n389\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.310\nAll kidding aside,\nit's a very important point he makes.\n\n390\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.410\nOne of the most important points we can\nmake in an episode like this where we're\n\n391\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.870\nlaying down some of\nthe foundational thought processes.\n\n392\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.430\nHe talked about something that really,\nand I do spend time talking about this\n\n393\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.790\nwith customers as well and\nI'm glad you brought it up.\n\n394\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.410\nEssentially reading the owner's manual,\nis what we often refer to it as.\n\n395\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.420\nSo for those of you out there\nI'm gonna do this for you live.\n\n396\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.000\nBut for those of you out there that may or\nmay not be familiar with this,\n\n397\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.610\njust let me bring up a web browser\nwhile we're talking here for a minute.\n\n398\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:35.305\nWhere do you go to find the owners manual\nfor something like the World Wide Web for\n\n399\n00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:39.053\nsomething like TCP or IP.\n\n400\n00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.750\nAnd we talk about and you mentioned\nsomebody back in the 70s, the 80s\n\n401\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.455\nwhatever it was would have gone out and\nread the main will read that information.\n\n402\n00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:49.035\nWhat you really would\nbe doing essentially.\n\n403\n00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:52.595\nWould be going out and\nwould be looking for RFCs.\n\n404\n00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:59.280\nAnd when we go to Google.com,\n\n405\n00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.010\nbecause there was no knowledge\nit ever existed before Google.\n\n406\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.919\n&gt;&gt; The oracle of the internet.\n\n408\n00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:08.740\nSo if you look for RFC, request for\n\n409\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:14.030\ncomment through the IETFB\ninternet engineering task force.\n\n410\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.410\nAnd you go out to the RFC page.\n\n411\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.200\nWhere you can get the RFCs.\n\n412\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.280\nAnd you could take a look\nat the RFC series.\n\n413\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.360\nAnd yeah we'll put this up in\nthe show notes, give you this URL.\n\n414\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.290\nBut if you go out and you look at\nany of these RFCs, I often challenge\n\n415\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.210\nmy students in class, I'm like hey,\nhow do we know, we talk about networking.\n\n416\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.840\nWe talk about the OSI model.\n\n417\n00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.860\nWe're not gonna subject\nyou to that by the way.\n\n418\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.180\nWe talked through all that and here we\ngo through the TCP-IP conversations.\n\n419\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.690\nThey're not really one protocol\nthey're two separate ones.\n\n420\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.160\nHere is what TCP does.\n\n421\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.670\nHere is what IP does, layer three, layer\nfour about TCP layer four IP layer three.\n\n422\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.650\nAnd by the way there's this thing\ncalled UDP tell the opposite it is TCP,\n\n423\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.580\nhow do we about all of that?\n\n424\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.870\nAnd so well if you had to figure it out\nand I wasn't around, what would you do?\n\n425\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.970\nWell I don't know, I'd go listen\nto somebody else talk about it.\n\n426\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.510\nNo, not the right answer.\n\n427\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.400\nYou'd go out and read the RFC for TCP.\n\n428\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.630\nYou know what the RFC for TCP is?\n\n429\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.400\n&gt;&gt; I do not know it off\nthe top of my head.\n\n430\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.350\n&gt;&gt; You do not.\n&gt;&gt; I should, but I don't.\n\n431\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.030\n&gt;&gt; No, you should not.\n\n432\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.675\n&gt;&gt; That's a fail on my part.\n\n433\n00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nobody's supposed to know, right?\n\n434\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.350\nSo if you go out of your search,\nup in the search bar there, RC.\n\n435\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.500\nYou just put in TCP.\n\n436\n00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.065\nYou'll see that you've\ngot the DOD standard\n\n437\n00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:27.253\nTransmission Control Protocol, TCP.\n\n438\n00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:28.591\nThat's what TCP stands for.\n\n439\n00:21:28.591 --> 00:21:30.809\nRFC761, right?\n\n440\n00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:34.780\nYou'll see 793,\nwhich is the newer version of that.\n\n441\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.040\nSurprisingly and this is one of\nthe things I like about using the editor.\n\n442\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.757\nYou get every RFC.\n\n443\n00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.403\nSo you get to see the original, you get\nto see all the ones that come after and\n\n444\n00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:44.800\nyou're gonna be able to pick that\none you wanna take a look at.\n\n445\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.803\nBut you'll see for\ninstance when you look at the TCP,\n\n446\n00:21:47.803 --> 00:21:51.474\nRFC from I think it's September of 81,\nroughly about a year and\n\n447\n00:21:51.474 --> 00:21:55.716\na half after the original what you're\ngonna find is that it's obsoletes.\n\n448\n00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:59.025\nRC-761 meaning the original one\ncame out and said okay more or\n\n449\n00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:01.180\nless this is what you're going to do.\n\n450\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.360\nThen about a year and\na half later they came out and\n\n451\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.050\nsaid okay hey by the way we've\ngot all this other stuff.\n\n452\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Adam really quickly you were talking\nabout the different I guess editions or\n\n453\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.010\nrevisions of these RFCs.\n\n454\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.810\nShould we only concern ourselves\nwith the latest revision of it?\n\n455\n00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:20.290\nOr should we typically also be looking\nback to see where it came from?\n\n456\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.900\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's a really great question.\n\n457\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.100\nSo what we wanna make sure we do\nis that we look ahead and behind.\n\n458\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.269\nAnd if we can go back to my\nmachine real quick, right, and\n\n459\n00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:29.455\njust take a look at the screen.\n\n460\n00:22:29.455 --> 00:22:32.475\nSo as we were talking about,\nwhen we did the search,\n\n461\n00:22:32.475 --> 00:22:36.332\nwe found the very first instance\nwas roughly January of 1980.\n\n462\n00:22:36.332 --> 00:22:38.979\nThen about a year and a half later,\nas we were saying, we saw the update and\n\n463\n00:22:38.979 --> 00:22:41.870\nthat's the one the we were focused\non that we're gonna take a look at.\n\n464\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.555\nAnd then in that column that I was\npointing out where it says obsoleted by or\n\n465\n00:22:45.555 --> 00:22:51.160\nobsoletes, the older RFC 761 the very\nfirst one is reference there and\n\n466\n00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.020\nsay hey by the way that's no longer valid.\n\n467\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.590\nBut guess what there's a whole\nbunch that are updating\n\n468\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.570\nthe one we're taking a look\nat 793 that come a lot later.\n\n469\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.670\nThey're listed here in the last\nfive ten years whatever it is.\n\n470\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.700\nSo it's actually important to kind\nof take a look at both often times.\n\n471\n00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.070\nJust that way we know we're zeroing in\non the most relevant information, but\n\n472\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.250\nwe also may wanna look at some of the\nnewer ones to see if there's an update.\n\n473\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:18.247\nFor instance, you have some of the newer\nstandards, the new RFCs like 6528.\n\n474\n00:23:18.247 --> 00:23:20.603\nI we just take a look\nat the most recent one,\n\n475\n00:23:20.603 --> 00:23:23.630\nthis one defending against\nsequence number attacks.\n\n476\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.640\nFebruary 2012.\n\n477\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.750\nThat comes out close to probably\n20 years from the original one.\n\n478\n00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.180\nA little bit over 20 years.\n\n479\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.560\nAnd it's an update to some of\nthe core fundamental concepts and\n\n480\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.050\nfunctionality, built into TCP,\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n481\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.040\nSo it's good to know about those things.\n\n482\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.050\nBut Daniel's original point was,\nhey read the owner's manual.\n\n483\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.736\nBecause this is the people that\nare getting that information and\n\n484\n00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:48.589\nunderstanding it.\n\n485\n00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:51.882\nThe people that go out and\ntook a look at the RFC, any of them or\n\n486\n00:23:51.882 --> 00:23:56.404\nall of them, you're gonna be the people\nthat really fundamentally understand how\n\n487\n00:23:56.404 --> 00:23:57.904\na protocol like TCP works.\n\n488\n00:23:57.904 --> 00:24:01.664\nAnd as a result are gonna be better\nequipped not only to hack And break in,\n\n489\n00:24:01.664 --> 00:24:03.033\nand do all the bad things.\n\n490\n00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:07.070\nBut potentially also to find the answers\naround the things were done.\n\n491\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.000\nAnd so,\nwhen you wanna understand what's going on,\n\n492\n00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.390\nyou wanna be effective as a forensic\ninvestigator, you've actually go out.\n\n493\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.630\nAnd you gotta read, not every RFP,\n\n494\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.230\nI'm not suggesting you sit down,\nor RFP listen to me.\n\n495\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.360\nYou should go out and\nread the RFP in case you wanna buy an RFC.\n\n496\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.222\nIf you're gonna read the RFC for\nTCP, I sound like Dr. Seuss right.\n\n497\n00:24:26.222 --> 00:24:28.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna go out and\n\n498\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.970\nread a document, and\n\n499\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.450\nI'm gonna show you here what\nthe table of contents looks like.\n\n500\n00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.260\nThat is roughly you could see about\n80 some odd pages long 85 pages.\n\n501\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.720\nThe majority of it is really actually\nnot even all that critical right.\n\n502\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.800\nWe don't need the introduction,\nwe don't need the philosophy.\n\n503\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.590\nWhat we really need are the functional\nspec information page 15 down give or\n\n504\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.400\ntake about through page 75.\n\n505\n00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.780\nWhere we're gonna see all the information\nabout things like terminology,\n\n506\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.270\nsequence numbers, right.\n\n507\n00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.090\nSo sequence number attacks,\nmost recent update February\n\n508\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.480\nof 2012 is focused on that section and\nhow to defend against them.\n\n509\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.065\nEstablishing, closing a connection, data\ncommunications, all that stuff, right,\n\n510\n00:25:05.065 --> 00:25:05.931\nheader format.\n\n511\n00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:07.859\nJust reading the section on the header,\n\n512\n00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:10.753\nfour pages alone, it's gonna tell us so\nmuch information,\n\n513\n00:25:10.753 --> 00:25:14.573\nthat's gonna be critical to what we talk\nabout in upcoming episodes and shows.\n\n514\n00:25:14.573 --> 00:25:18.156\nWith regards to this topic and\nunderstanding what the header of a data\n\n515\n00:25:18.156 --> 00:25:20.688\npack it looks like,\nwhat information is there,\n\n516\n00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:24.916\nwhat it can tell us forensically about\ninformation on a system coming and going.\n\n517\n00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:28.981\nIt's so valuable and there's so much\ninformation we have to know about and yet\n\n518\n00:25:28.981 --> 00:25:32.960\nmost people have never actually read\nthis or understood how it works.\n\n519\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.780\nThey obviously,\nthey listen to people like you and I and\n\n520\n00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.760\nall the other people that\nunderstand this and talk about it.\n\n521\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.130\nBut it's indirect, right,\n\n522\n00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.546\nyou don't necessarily understand it\nyourself cuz you haven't looked at it.\n\n523\n00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:47.650\nAnd let me be clear I'm not suggesting\nthat you have to go out and read these\n\n524\n00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.340\ndocuments to become a good at what we're\ntalking about here, to become an expert.\n\n525\n00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.920\nI haven't read all those RFCs,\nright, honestly.\n\n526\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.750\nI read the ones that I need to understand,\nI need to know and or\n\n527\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.820\nI need to interact with when I need them.\n\n528\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.030\nAnd that's what you need\nto be prepared to do.\n\n529\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.380\nBut you don't need to go read\nevery one ahead of time.\n\n530\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.370\nBut you need to know where to find them\nand understand that they're important and\n\n531\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.820\nyou should be looking at them.\n\n532\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.820\nThis is critical information,\nit is part of the baseline,\n\n533\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.560\nthe bedrock knowledge that\nas a forensics examiner,\n\n534\n00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.400\nforensics investigator,\nspecific to CHFI and more broadly,\n\n535\n00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.670\nto anybody who does forensics work in\nthe digital field that you have to have.\n\n536\n00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.010\nEssentially that bookshelf,\n\n537\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.830\nthat reference of knowledge, we don't\nwalk around with it, in our heads, right.\n\n538\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.920\nWe call that tribal knowledge,\nstuff you know but no body else does.\n\n539\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.010\nI don't remember every aspect of\nhow TCP works, but I can tell you,\n\n540\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.280\nwhere to go find it if I to look it up.\n\n541\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.400\nI just actually call Daniel he\ntells me whatever I need to know.\n\n542\n00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.190\nCuz he watched it all wherever it is\nin his head, that why he's so tall.\n\n543\n00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.730\nBecause he's got all that knowledge, down\nin the shoes, that's where he keeps it.\n\n544\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.840\nSo, he builds on that knowledge,\nthat's exactly what he does, right.\n\n545\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.940\nAnyway, we digress, so\nit's important for you to understand,\n\n546\n00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.640\nfor us to understand where\nto go to find this stuff.\n\n547\n00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.010\nSo when you brought that question up,\nit made me think about the fact that,\n\n548\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.410\nand I often refer to\nthis as the Ikea analogy.\n\n549\n00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.350\nAnd you may have heard me use this\nin one of our other discussions in\n\n550\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.410\na prior episode of the show.\n\n551\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.850\nBut probably a lot of us\nhave had the example, or\n\n552\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.520\nthe, kind of the understanding, and\nfirst hand experience of having to go\n\n553\n00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.670\nbuy something and or\nbuild something somebody bought from Ikea.\n\n554\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.030\nAnd if you think about the idea of\nvery simple but incredibly effective\n\n555\n00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.690\nmodel that Ikea has put together to\nsell and market their stuff right.\n\n556\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:29.400\nYou take things people need, you break\nthem into constituent component modular\n\n557\n00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.150\nparts, you box them up, you create a set\nof instructions much like see Dick, Jane.\n\n558\n00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.010\nYou see Dick and Jane run, right.\n\n559\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:40.290\nSee spot run, the very,\nvery simple pictograms and\n\n560\n00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.998\nyou then give people the ability\nto follow through that lot.\n\n561\n00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:44.170\nYou're going to be able to create,\n\n562\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.300\nessentially from a bunch of\njigsaw pieces whatever they want.\n\n563\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.400\nIt's the same idea when we talk\nabout forensic examination\n\n564\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.880\nfrom the computer perspective.\n\n565\n00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.910\nThere's all these different parts and\npieces of information,\n\n566\n00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.830\nwe've gotta pull them together and\nfigure out what may be valuable.\n\n567\n00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.960\nI was talking about some tools earlier,\nand\n\n568\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.510\nways we could do this from\ntools that are built in.\n\n569\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.090\nIf we can go back to my machine, I wanna\njust pick up on that thought and finish up\n\n570\n00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.150\nwith the quick little demonstration\nslash discussion we were talking about.\n\n571\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.248\nYeah, we were in there\nkinda taking a look,\n\n572\n00:28:13.248 --> 00:28:16.422\nlet me just move the window over just\na tad bit there so you guys can see.\n\n573\n00:28:16.422 --> 00:28:18.750\nYeah, we we're talking about\nthe use of IP config for\n\n574\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.860\ninstance right, and register DNS,\nforce DNS, display DNS.\n\n575\n00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.940\nJust capturing this information\non the screen by itself, right.\n\n576\n00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:33.350\nAnd so instead of IP config,\ndoing IP config display DNS, right.\n\n577\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.100\nAnd being able to get that information.\n\n578\n00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.400\nNow that in and of itself, right,\nput that information into the cash,\n\n579\n00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.460\ninto the register, essentially memory\nspace that the command line is using.\n\n580\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.640\nAnd it's gone through and\nscrolled through, and although it's there,\n\n581\n00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.330\nI haven't actually captured it,\nI've simply examined it.\n\n582\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.560\nIf I wanna capture that off the system and\nhave a record of it,\n\n583\n00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.520\nI've gotta do something, right,\nother than just look at it.\n\n584\n00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.310\nIf it's one or two, I could get out\nmy camera, I could take a picture.\n\n585\n00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.470\nYou're gonna hear me talk\nconstantly about the fact,\n\n586\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.070\nhey did we take a picture of that?\n\n587\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.010\nDid we record the state on that?\n\n588\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.290\nAs an examiner do we know where everything\nwas before we touched anything?\n\n589\n00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.900\nIt's a vital thought process for\nus as forensic investigators.\n\n590\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.410\nIf we don't understand how everything\nwas set up, where it was, how it look\n\n591\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.240\nbefore we do anything, we're not gonna be\nable to talk knowledgeably about it later.\n\n592\n00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.360\nAnd this becomes a very big deal for us.\n\n593\n00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.590\nBut we haven't captured all\nwe've done is examined it.\n\n594\n00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:27.922\nIf we wanna capture it, right, we may have\nto do something like outputting that and\n\n595\n00:29:27.922 --> 00:29:29.763\nwe may output that to a file.\n\n596\n00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:34.218\nNow if I output it let's say,\nto the C drive,\n\n597\n00:29:34.218 --> 00:29:38.324\nright, and do something like a display or\n\n598\n00:29:38.324 --> 00:29:42.447\ndisn.txt or whatever it may be, right.\n\n599\n00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:45.951\nIt's gonna output to the root\nof the C drive at text file, but\n\n600\n00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:49.860\nI've modified the state of\nthe system by creating that file.\n\n601\n00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.605\nI've actually done something\nthat is not sound forensically.\n\n602\n00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:57.410\nI've essentially modified the state of\nthis machine and in so doing I may have\n\n603\n00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.650\nactually modified the information and\nthe evidence that I'm looking to capture.\n\n604\n00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.560\nThat would not normally be\nacceptable as a forensic practice.\n\n605\n00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.310\nBut what I could do is output\nthat to an external drive\n\n606\n00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.790\nthat is using what is\ncalled a write blocker.\n\n607\n00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.110\nAnd a write blocker is a piece of software\nthat prevents the drive from writing back\n\n608\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.990\nto the target system, right,\nthat we're gonna send it to.\n\n609\n00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:24.580\nIt cannot write back to the source\nmodifying time stamps, adding information,\n\n610\n00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.790\nmetadata any of the kind of stuff\nwe normally when we access or\n\n611\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.600\nmodify a file will be blocked.\n\n612\n00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.600\nIt's a one way path that allows us\nto take data out of the system but\n\n613\n00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.420\nnot allow usto bring data back.\n\n614\n00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.790\nAnd so as a result, right, when we go and\n\n615\n00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.970\nwe're able to examine, right,\nwhat's going on, right.\n\n616\n00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.351\nSo if I go into the C drive here,\nand I see dsn.txt,\n\n617\n00:30:45.351 --> 00:30:49.221\nI'll see that the date\nmodification timestamp is there.\n\n618\n00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:53.884\nIt's amazing how I point this way, I\nstruggle with this whole direction thing,\n\n619\n00:30:53.884 --> 00:30:54.922\nas you well know.\n\n620\n00:30:54.922 --> 00:30:59.665\nBut I point where I happen to get it\nright here, but it's actually like no,\n\n621\n00:30:59.665 --> 00:31:02.376\nwait, let me go, it's-\n&gt;&gt; There.\n\n622\n00:31:02.376 --> 00:31:03.374\n&gt;&gt; Just about.\n\n623\n00:31:03.374 --> 00:31:05.267\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to stretch me,\n\n624\n00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:08.850\npick me up and hang me sideways, so\nI can kinda hang, and just about there.\n\n625\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.760\nWhat I have to do is I have to actually\nprobably, wait, we can do this.\n\n626\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.400\nWe can make this work, just hold on\na second, I can actually make this work.\n\n627\n00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.739\nThis is fun,\nthis is why I do this kinda stuff, so\n\n628\n00:31:17.739 --> 00:31:19.919\nI can play around with\nthis cool technology.\n\n629\n00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:22.543\n&gt;&gt; You know you have a mouse\npointer on your screen.\n\n630\n00:31:22.543 --> 00:31:25.347\n&gt;&gt; Don't be smart ass, okay,\nno go back they we're are so okay.\n\n631\n00:31:25.347 --> 00:31:26.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't help this,\n\n632\n00:31:26.842 --> 00:31:28.528\none less, lots of passengers.\n\n633\n00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:30.230\nBe a passenger, don't be a bus driver.\n\n634\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.900\nSo when I do this, right,\nnow I'm actually pointing to it.\n\n635\n00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.030\n&gt;&gt; You are actually pointing there.\n\n636\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.560\n&gt;&gt; Because I have two hands,\nwhen I do this,\n\n637\n00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.800\nyou can't see the timestamp because\nnow it's behind the window.\n\n638\n00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.690\n&gt;&gt; This is stuff you only\nget here at IT Pro TV.\n\n639\n00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.270\n&gt;&gt; There was actually no point to that\ndemo, other than the fact that I could.\n\n640\n00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.380\n&gt;&gt; It was just we wanted to see it happen.\n\n641\n00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.850\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to see\nif I could make it work.\n\n642\n00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.980\nAll right but you can see here that I\ndid create a, there's the pop-up, right.\n\n643\n00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.720\nWe could see that the timestamp\nis today's date and time.\n\n644\n00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.620\nBut that's modified, the core\nunderlying assumptions in the system.\n\n645\n00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.180\nThere's a brand new file in the root\nof the C drive that wasn't there\n\n646\n00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.790\nwhen the system may have been hacked,\nright.\n\n647\n00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:07.100\nI mean this is brand new stuff, so if I do\nit this way, this is forensically unsound.\n\n648\n00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.610\n&gt;&gt; You've tampered with evidence.\n\n649\n00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.450\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n&gt;&gt; Accidentally.\n\n650\n00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.066\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, potentially modified the\nstate of the machine in such a way that\n\n651\n00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.887\nI've rendered the evidence useless.\n\n652\n00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:20.083\nBecause I now cannot present anything I\nfind in this machine in a court of law and\n\n653\n00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:23.707\nexplain forensically from\na sound chain of custody and\n\n654\n00:32:23.707 --> 00:32:27.899\nevidence perspective that this\nevidence has been untainted.\n\n655\n00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:31.657\nAs you pointed out because essentially,\nmy activity just modified the current\n\n656\n00:32:31.657 --> 00:32:34.660\nstate of the system which\nwould be unacceptable.\n\n657\n00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.570\n&gt;&gt; Adam this is extremely\ninteresting stuff.\n\n658\n00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.545\nI'm looking at our clock,\nwe are out of time, but\n\n659\n00:32:39.545 --> 00:32:42.192\nI would definitely wanna continue\nthis conversation in part two.\n\n660\n00:32:42.192 --> 00:32:43.957\nI know you wanna get into the methodology.\n\n661\n00:32:43.957 --> 00:32:49.688\nHow do we do a forensics investigation\ncorrectly so that we don't run into things\n\n662\n00:32:49.688 --> 00:32:54.910\nlike this and accidentally render\nour evidence completely unusable.\n\n663\n00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.110\nThat is something we want to avoid.\n\n664\n00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.280\nSo, I really look forward to\nseeing you in part two on this.\n\n665\n00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.878\nAnything you would like to part\nour audience with on our way out?\n\n666\n00:33:01.878 --> 00:33:04.745\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n667\n00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:09.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] that being said, as I\nsaid, we are out of time for this episode.\n\n668\n00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.080\nDefiantly join us back in for part two, so\n\n669\n00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.010\nI guess signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n670\n00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.567\n&gt;&gt; I am part two.\n\n671\n00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:18.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Coming soon.\n\n672\n00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.541\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nwe'll see you next time, guys.\n\n673\n00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:22.039\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n674\n00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:28.726\n[MUSIC]\n\n675\n00:33:28.726 --> 00:33:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:05.851\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.138\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:11.761\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.753\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:16.220\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.775\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.720\nIn today's episode, we'll continuing\non with more in our CHFI series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.170\nJoining us back in the studio again for\n\n11\n00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.130\npart two on some of the basics is\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.340\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.260\n&gt;&gt; I don't know who you are.\n\n14\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.013\nI'm not your friend, and\nI'm certainly not a good friend.\n\n15\n00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.497\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're a very good friend.\n\n16\n00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:33.635\n&gt;&gt; Very good friends, right.\n\n17\n00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:34.948\nI don't know this man, he's a stranger.\n\n18\n00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:38.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, anyway, so we're back, and\n\n19\n00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.630\nas Daniel was saying\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny that I know his name,\n\n20\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.440\nbut don't know him but\nthen again, life's like that.\n\n21\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.580\n&gt;&gt; It was on the restraining order.\n\n22\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.920\n&gt;&gt; It was, you're absolutely right.\n\n23\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980\nYou mentioned that as they were\ndragging you out before we got started.\n\n24\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.900\nSo as Daniel mentioned, right,\nwe're gonna take a look at kind of\n\n25\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.270\ncontinuing our conversation a little bit\nright with regards to what we were doing.\n\n26\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.040\nIn our last episode, we were talking\nabout some of the general ideas, right?\n\n27\n00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.580\nHow do we understand forensics?\n\n28\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.820\nWhat is it from a general perspective?\n\n29\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.640\nHow do we link it to computers?\n\n30\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.790\nStart to talk a bit about some of\nthe knowledge that exists out there,\n\n31\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.490\ncommon built-in tools.\n\n32\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.410\nHow the, essentially,\nthe command line can be your friend.\n\n33\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.410\nBut you gotta be careful, as I showed you,\nbecause using the command line in\n\n34\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.635\nan inappropriate, non-forensically\nsound way, could get us into trouble.\n\n35\n00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:21.090\nAnd that's something we gotta think about.\n\n36\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.490\nAnd as we were showing at\nthe end of the last episode,\n\n37\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.260\nsomething that potentially is gonna be\na problem for us if we're not careful.\n\n38\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.120\nBecause if we're not able to\ndo these kinds of things and\n\n39\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.720\ndo them in a forensically sound way,\nwe may blow the only chance we have\n\n40\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.873\nto use the evidence we find and to\npresent it in a way that can then show or\n\n41\n00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:39.580\nshed light as to what might have occurred.\n\n42\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.690\nSo we have to think about that,\nbe aware of that.\n\n43\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.695\nAnd we'll come back to that theme and\ntalk more about it as we go.\n\n44\n00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:47.748\nBut I wanna pick up, not just with that\nthought process, but Daniel alluded to at\n\n45\n00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:51.324\nthe last of the last episode that\nessentially there's a methodology,\n\n46\n00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:53.071\na thought process, at play here.\n\n47\n00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.070\nAnd we wanna talk a bit about that.\n\n48\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.140\nHow do we approach doing the things\nwe're talking about doing and\n\n49\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.690\ndoing them in this forensically\nsound way that I keep mentioning?\n\n50\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd we wanna go through\nthe logic of this with you,\n\n51\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.710\ntalk a bit about the way in which we may\npresent information, examine it, look for\n\n52\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.450\nit, and the things we do and\ndon't do with regards to that.\n\n53\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.370\nBefore we do that,\n\n54\n00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.390\nwe've talked about the different ways\nin which systems can be attacked.\n\n55\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.030\nI've mentioned in the prior episode,\nI mentioned in the linkage to the broader\n\n56\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.620\nthought process for security and\nCEH, certified ethical hacking,\n\n57\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.470\nthat I mentioned in the introduction\nof our beginning episode and\n\n58\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.528\nconversation in this area that that\nknowledge may be valuable for you.\n\n59\n00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:32.540\nI mentioned that there are lots of\ndifferent things we have to be aware of.\n\n60\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.110\nAs a good forensic examiner,\ngood forensic investigator,\n\n61\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.910\nwe wanna have knowledge\nof how bad things happen.\n\n62\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.240\nAnd by doing that, we're gonna be\nmore effective in our job, right.\n\n63\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.320\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you go out and\nbecome a bad person, but\n\n64\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.460\nI am suggesting that you at\nleast understand the logic and\n\n65\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.790\nthe methodology and the thought process\nwith regards to how bad things occur.\n\n66\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.960\nSo we have to also at that high level\nreally start thinking about the different\n\n67\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.920\nplaces that attacks occur from.\n\n68\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.690\nYou were, Daniel, in our last\nconversation, you would talk a little bit\n\n69\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.570\nabout the fact that there are all\nsorts of things that can go wrong.\n\n70\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.018\nAnd does forensics help us to only\nunderstand when something has already\n\n71\n00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:11.420\nhappened, how it did, or is it\nsomething we should use in other areas?\n\n72\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.410\nAnd I said that essentially it helps\nus to understand what did happen, but\n\n73\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.500\nalso helps us to potentially\nlook at a situation and\n\n74\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.850\nexamine whether something bad happened or\nnot, right?\n\n75\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.790\nAnd when we think about where attacks come\nfrom, we often wanna think about the fact\n\n76\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.120\nthat we could attack a system from\neither inside the network, so\n\n77\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.290\nwe often call those internal attacks.\n\n78\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.990\nAnd we can also attack it from outside\nthe network, right, external attacks.\n\n79\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.900\nAnd we wanna understand that bad things\nhappen all around us all the time, right.\n\n80\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.190\nIt's not like we're inside of\nour office on our computer and\n\n81\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.680\neverything is always good,\nquite the opposite.\n\n82\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.280\nA lot of times things are good, but\na lot of times they may not be.\n\n83\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.310\nAnd it's not like we go outside and\nall good stuff or bad stuff happens there.\n\n84\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.990\nBecause quite often everything's\nfine when we go outside.\n\n85\n00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.840\nBut quite often, things sometimes\njust don't always work out that way.\n\n86\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.510\nAnd so we have to be on guard.\n\n87\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.860\nWe have to be aware.\n\n88\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.367\nAnd a forensic investigator has to be\nconstantly on the look out for telltale or\n\n89\n00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:09.280\nwarning signs of where attacks are coming\nfrom, and what kind of attacks may occur.\n\n90\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.680\nWhat are, if I ask you, Daniel,\n\n91\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.830\nif you don't mind me incorporating you\ninto our conversation here for a minute.\n\n92\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.560\nAnd even if you do, you hopefully\nwill have something to say anyway.\n\n93\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.190\nBut if I ask you, what are some of,\npotentially examples of cyber crimes?\n\n94\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.320\nOr crimes that may occur that a forensic\ninvestigator focused on digital\n\n95\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.650\ninformation and\ncomputer forensics may be interested in.\n\n96\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.958\nWhat are some of the things\nyou may put on that list?\n\n97\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.360\n&gt;&gt; I would think the theft of intellectual\nproperty is the first thing that jumps\n\n98\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.550\nright to my mind.\n\n99\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.660\n&gt;&gt; Theft of intellectual property.\n\n100\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.280\nGreat one, right?\n\n101\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.560\nSo if the intellectual\nproperty is on a machine.\n\n102\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.870\nMaybe it's a text file,\nmaybe it's a Word document.\n\n103\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.940\nWho knows what it is?\n\n104\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.050\nThat would certainly\nfall into that category.\n\n105\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.740\nCrimes executed using a computer.\n\n106\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.040\nCrimes executed against a computer.\n\n107\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.760\nAnd crimes executed that\nare incidental to the computer.\n\n108\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.990\nThey have nothing to do with the computer,\nthe computer just happens to be there.\n\n109\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.720\nAre all gonna fall into this category,\nright?\n\n110\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.010\nSo if I use a computer to hack\ninto somebody else's machine and\n\n111\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.910\nsteal some of that information\nDaniel was just alluding to,\n\n112\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.490\nthat would fall into a potential area\nwhere a cyber crimes investigator,\n\n113\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.170\na forensics investigator\nthat does digital forensics,\n\n114\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.799\nwould potentially be interested\nin looking at that, right?\n\n115\n00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:20.084\nAnd so there's lots of different places,\nlots of different activities, lots of\n\n116\n00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:23.480\ndifferent ways that we would potentially\nbe drawn in to one of these conversations.\n\n117\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.790\nI had a little strange issue going on with\nmy laptop, not the one that we had before.\n\n118\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.714\n[LAUGH] Yeah, we had all sorts of\ncrazy stuff happening with the video.\n\n119\n00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:35.900\nBut my own machine that's obviously so\nwell put together here,\n\n120\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.322\nthat as I point out from time to time\nI'm using electrical tape to hold\n\n121\n00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:41.355\none of the corners of it together.\n\n122\n00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:44.751\nThat's cuz it's been all over\nthe world with me several times, and\n\n123\n00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:47.085\nhas just seen a lot of travel and\nwear and tear.\n\n124\n00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:50.346\nBut I've actually started to have\nsomething strange going on with this\n\n125\n00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:51.570\nmachine recently.\n\n126\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.440\nDid a couple of updates, service pack\nupdates, whatever they were, and as\n\n127\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.140\na result of some of that, the machine has\nnow started to take long time to shut off.\n\n128\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.639\nWhen I go to shut it down, it goes through\nthat log off screen, and it sits there\n\n129\n00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.211\nalmost like it's riding temporary cache\ndata from the profile for a long time.\n\n130\n00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:11.820\nAnd then all of a sudden it will go dim,\nso the screen almost goes dark.\n\n131\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.940\nIt's doing that, then it comes back on,\n\n132\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.340\ndoes the normal full light up,\nlog off quickly, shut down thing.\n\n133\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.450\nBut clearly there's something going on\non the temp registers in the machine.\n\n134\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.340\nDon't know what it is.\n\n135\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.900\nHaven't had a chance to look at it.\n\n136\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.464\nBut it's definitely noticeably different\nbehavior than prior to that update.\n\n137\n00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:30.458\nSo thankfully, right,\nI use system restore and restore points,\n\n138\n00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:35.448\nso I can go backwards and say, okay maybe\nthat was bad software, take that out, and\n\n139\n00:06:35.448 --> 00:06:37.580\nI can hopefully fix that.\n\n140\n00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.205\nThis is not a perfect example\nof what we're talking about, but\n\n141\n00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:45.320\nit's one example of the kind of thing that\nan investigator will pay attention to.\n\n142\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.020\nHey, what's been going with that machine?\n\n143\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.510\nIs there something unusual?\n\n144\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.050\nAnd maybe if there is, we should take\na look at what's been happening.\n\n145\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.790\nCan you help me to understand\nwhen that occurred?\n\n146\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:53.930\nWhen did it start?\n\n147\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.210\nWas it okay up until this point in time,\nstarted acting weird here now?\n\n148\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.430\nWhat's the behavior we're seeing?\n\n149\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.150\nAnd you start to retell that tale,\ncapture that information.\n\n150\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.900\nSo let's talk about that methodology\na little bit that I was suggesting, right?\n\n151\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.580\nWe've talked about some of the ways\nin which we can get attacked.\n\n152\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.490\nTalked about some examples\nof different kinds of\n\n153\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.830\ncriminal activities we'd be interested in.\n\n154\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.710\nUse the computer to break into something,\n\n155\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.864\nsteal it from the computer directly,\nbeat somebody with the computer.\n\n156\n00:07:18.864 --> 00:07:20.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Any or all three of those,\n\n157\n00:07:20.104 --> 00:07:23.193\npotentially things that a digital\nforensics investigator would be\n\n158\n00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:23.960\ninterested in.\n\n159\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.210\nAnd obviously, any or\nall those things are illegal,\n\n160\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.070\nyou should not do any of them, by the way.\n\n161\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.680\nBut having said that, there's\ndefinitely a methodology at play here,\n\n162\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.440\nwanna think about this.\n\n163\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.358\nSo we often talk about a 14-step.\n\n164\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:39.350\nOne four, 14-step methodology\nassociated with investigation\n\n165\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.120\nof cyber crimes or crimes that take place\ninside of the digital world, right?\n\n166\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.310\nSo let's walk through these\nsteps at a high level.\n\n167\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.360\nStep one, identify the computer crimes.\n\n168\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.488\nWe've just been talking about,\nwhat kind a crime is it?\n\n169\n00:07:50.488 --> 00:07:53.949\nIs it a crime against the computer,\ncrime committed through the computer,\n\n170\n00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:58.070\ncrime incidental to the computer, as often\nthrough the categories we've talked about.\n\n171\n00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.830\nCollect preliminary evidence.\n\n172\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.870\nStep number two so start to examine,\nstart to collect evidence.\n\n173\n00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.420\nNow collecting evidence is interesting,\nright.\n\n174\n00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.954\nProbably a lot of you,\nlot of us have seen those TV shows, right.\n\n175\n00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:13.307\nCSI-\n&gt;&gt; I love NCIS.\n\n176\n00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:17.584\n&gt;&gt; And NCIS, my wife loves NCIS,\nNCIS and Law and Order and\n\n177\n00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:20.041\nall the ones that are out there.\n\n178\n00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.615\nThere's a lot of them, and\ndepending on which ones you watch,\n\n179\n00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:27.257\nthere are obviously different storylines,\nbut generically,\n\n180\n00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:31.653\nthe forensics investigation piece is\nfairly similar in all of them, right?\n\n181\n00:08:31.653 --> 00:08:34.052\nWe show up, there's some sort of crime,\n\n182\n00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:38.870\nwhether it's a body laying on the ground\nor it's a computer, whatever it is.\n\n183\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.690\nAnd there's a crime scene, right.\n\n184\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.940\nThe evidence that's scattered\naround in relation to what went on\n\n185\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.280\nduring the commission of the crime\nright before, during and after.\n\n186\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.150\nAnd that evidence has to be examined,\ncollected, but\n\n187\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.080\nit also has to be put into context.\n\n188\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.155\nAnd so when we think about\ncollecting preliminary evidence,\n\n189\n00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:58.300\nwhat we have to do is we show up\nas what we call a first responder.\n\n190\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.320\nSomebody's gonna as we always say,\ngonna be first.\n\n191\n00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.430\nAnd so, if you're a first responder,\nwhoever's on the scene, whoever discovers\n\n192\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.820\nthat this has happened, they may or\nmay not be forensically trained, right.\n\n193\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.630\nDaniel, or myself, or whoever,\nmay show up and say hey,\n\n194\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.380\nlooks like something's unusual.\n\n195\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.370\nWhy is that door open?\n\n196\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.130\nLet me go take a look, when it's supposed\nto be locked, and poke our head in and\n\n197\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.300\nsee that's something's wrong.\n\n198\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.029\nBut we may not be equipped to\ndeal with what we see, right,\n\n199\n00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.271\nwe may not know what to do.\n\n200\n00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.827\nAnd we may know enough hopefully\nnot to go in there, poke around,\n\n201\n00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:29.360\ntouch a bunch of stuff.\n\n202\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.620\nBut we may not be equipped\nto actually respond and\n\n203\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.120\ndeal with collection of evidence.\n\n204\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.940\nSo one of the most important things\nwe tell people with regards to\n\n205\n00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.420\nthe methodology is if you're\nnot trained it's better for\n\n206\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.660\nyou to simply step outside,\ndon't touch anything.\n\n207\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.030\nCall somebody and just stand there and\nmake sure nobody goes in, right.\n\n208\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.460\nIt's better for you, in other words,\nto secure the scene than it is for\n\n209\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.720\nyou to go traipsing around in there and\npotentially screwing everything up.\n\n210\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.830\nBecause every time you walk,\n\n211\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.040\neverything you touch, everything you do,\nwe have to extrapolate all that out and\n\n212\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.130\nthen replay essentially what\nhappened without you being in there.\n\n213\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.145\nTry to figure out what actually we're not,\n\n214\n00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:08.524\nand this becomes very difficult when\nyour fingerprints are everywhere,\n\n215\n00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:12.463\nyour footprints are everywhere, you've\nleft left DNA sample everywhere, right.\n\n216\n00:10:12.463 --> 00:10:17.068\nWe take that all that stuff for granted,\nwe go through live, we really think about\n\n217\n00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:20.892\nall the stuff we do and the evidence\nwill be behind on regular basis.\n\n218\n00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:23.908\nSo actually, I have to say,\nthere was a study done recently,\n\n219\n00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:27.910\nthat I read about with regards to hacking,\nbut you're gonna hear me often refer to\n\n220\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.250\nthe fact that these are two\nsides of the same coin, right.\n\n221\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.440\nUnderstanding how to hack is really the\npre-requisite knowledge as I pointed out\n\n222\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.130\nto really becoming effective\nat doing this kind of work\n\n223\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.460\nbecause you're gonna understand\nthe mechanics of what can go wrong, and\n\n224\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.810\ntherefore understand what to look for\nto figure out what happened.\n\n225\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.940\nBut there was a really interesting study\nthat was done recently with regards to,\n\n226\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.190\nof all things, cellphones.\n\n227\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.590\nWe all have cell phones.\n\n228\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.560\nWell, most of us have cell phones anyway.\n\n229\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.870\nAnd those of us that use them,\n\n230\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.880\nmost of us have what we would\ncall smart devices today, right?\n\n231\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.710\nDevices that you don't just make a phone\ncall on, but are gonna provide you\n\n232\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.260\nweb access, provide you the ability to\nuse apps and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.422\nAnd most of them are touch enabled, right.\n\n234\n00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:09.680\nSo you're swiping and pinching and\ndoing all sorts of stuff on the screen.\n\n235\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.400\nI wouldn't know about that stuff cuz I use\nan age old technology called a Blackberry.\n\n236\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.190\nThose of you that are out there that\nactually know that, good for you.\n\n237\n00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.083\nThose of you that are not, you're missing\nout on one of life's greatest pleasures.\n\n238\n00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I promise you.\n\n239\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.047\nAll right, but that aside.\n\n240\n00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.137\n&gt;&gt; I do miss the actual physical keyboard,\nI must say.\n\n241\n00:11:23.137 --> 00:11:27.269\n&gt;&gt; Look I've used them, as you've heard me\nrant and rave in various shows over many,\n\n242\n00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.500\nmany moons that we've been doing this.\n\n243\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.523\nYou have probably heard me say several\ntimes I've used them since they\n\n244\n00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:33.248\nfirst came out.\n\n245\n00:11:33.248 --> 00:11:37.863\nThey've been in the market for about 15,\n16, 17 years approximately now.\n\n246\n00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.765\nAnd I've had one every since they\nbrought out the very first model.\n\n247\n00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:43.956\nAnd I swear by them, although it's getting\nharder to swear, cuz there's less and\n\n248\n00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:44.785\nless of them around.\n\n249\n00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:45.447\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n250\n00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:48.930\n&gt;&gt; But, that's the only phone,\nthe only smart device I've ever had.\n\n251\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.920\nI've had other ones,\nI just don't like them, for\n\n252\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.400\na variety of reasons, I, security\namong them, stick with the Blackberry.\n\n253\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.519\nNot pertinent to what\nwe're here to talk about.\n\n254\n00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.680\nSo let's-\n&gt;&gt; We digress.\n\n255\n00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.262\n&gt;&gt; Digress.\n\n256\n00:11:57.262 --> 00:11:57.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We do,\n\n257\n00:11:57.853 --> 00:11:58.700\nwe just drove right off the cliff.\n\n258\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.500\nLike Thelma and Louise, we just went,\nright at the end of that movie,\n\n259\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.358\nright off the cliff.\n\n260\n00:12:02.358 --> 00:12:02.997\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n261\n00:12:02.997 --> 00:12:04.692\n&gt;&gt; So what I was gonna point out-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not holding your hand.\n\n262\n00:12:04.692 --> 00:12:07.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that, and my hair is just-\n&gt;&gt; Just bald.\n\n263\n00:12:07.618 --> 00:12:09.360\n&gt;&gt; I have like convertible head,\nif we do that, right.\n\n264\n00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.689\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was great though,\n\n265\n00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:13.348\nbecause if you saw the movie, when they\ndid go off the cliff, I mean obviously,\n\n266\n00:12:13.348 --> 00:12:14.874\nHollywood special effects\nbeing what it is.\n\n267\n00:12:14.874 --> 00:12:16.813\nBut the hair was perfect, right.\n\n268\n00:12:16.813 --> 00:12:19.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They drove off the Grand Canyon,\n\n269\n00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:20.382\nlike cliff right?\n\n270\n00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:21.891\nI mean literally drove\ninto the Grand Canyon.\n\n271\n00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:23.263\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Adam, CHFI.\n\n272\n00:12:23.263 --> 00:12:23.981\nCHFI, Adam.\n\n273\n00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:25.225\n&gt;&gt; But, it is CHFI.\n\n274\n00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:26.732\nI'm making a point, I'm coming back to it.\n\n275\n00:12:26.732 --> 00:12:28.916\nI'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; He's bringing a long curve.\n\n276\n00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.346\n&gt;&gt; I'm bringing it back,\nI'm bringing it back.\n\n277\n00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.445\nSo, the hair was perfect.\n\n278\n00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:36.020\nAnd my point was gonna be that\nyou don't have any but I do, and\n\n279\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.390\nmine, as you can see, is perfect.\n\n280\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.190\n&gt;&gt; It's wonderful.\n\n281\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.140\n&gt;&gt; Go to his.\n\n282\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.640\nThat was my point right,\nyou see look at that.\n\n283\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.740\nYou can't say the same thing I can.\n\n284\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.590\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there's\nmuch evidence either.\n\n285\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.800\n&gt;&gt; There is not, cuz you cut you hair and\nI clearly do not.\n\n286\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.465\nSo my point about the study\nwas the following, right.\n\n287\n00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:53.241\nVery interesting study,\nlooked at the DNA evidence.\n\n288\n00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:57.529\nThe remnant data that essentially they\ncalled it the crud that we leave behind on\n\n289\n00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:00.480\na device like a cell phone\nwhen we touch it all the time.\n\n290\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.326\nWe don't think about the fact that we\noften are putting our hands on all\n\n291\n00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:03.865\nthis stuff.\n\n292\n00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:08.693\nThey said the built-up layer of just\nrandom DNA garbage that you leave behind\n\n293\n00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:13.074\non the screen on the end of a normal day,\nmost people don't clean their\n\n294\n00:13:13.074 --> 00:13:16.884\ndevices that often is actually\nforensically valuable now.\n\n295\n00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:20.391\nBecause they can start to use\nthis to uniquely identify you and\n\n296\n00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:24.990\nuniquely identify, not just you, but\nthings about you and where you've been.\n\n297\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.520\nChemical traces, geolocation, so,\n\n298\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.020\nwe can say, you've been to this region of\nthe country, cuz you have this kind of\n\n299\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.740\nchemical trace in the DN evidence that\nis left behind of the device touch.\n\n300\n00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.773\nSo truly we're gonna revolutionize the way\nin which we actually do some of this,\n\n301\n00:13:38.773 --> 00:13:42.810\nbecause this top process this technology\nthat they pioneered with these studies\n\n302\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.666\nthat they were writing about is actually\nso it should have being developed for\n\n303\n00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:49.011\ncommercial and\nlaw enforcement related use.\n\n304\n00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:52.656\nIn criminal investigations and forensics\nstuff like what we're talking about here.\n\n305\n00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:54.293\nIt's so-\n&gt;&gt; Both amazing and terrifying.\n\n306\n00:13:54.293 --> 00:13:56.216\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, when you think about it,\n\n307\n00:13:56.216 --> 00:13:57.911\nliterally, hey, you drank that water, and\n\n308\n00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:00.452\nthe chemical makeup of that water\nsays you had to be in this area, and\n\n309\n00:14:00.452 --> 00:14:03.560\nyou were there like five days ago, that's\nthe only time that chemical was there.\n\n310\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.710\nI mean, that's the kind of\nstuff they're getting to\n\n311\n00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.860\n&gt;&gt; It's like Minority Report,\n\n312\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.820\nspooky if you think about that, right.\n\n313\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.030\nSo anyway, so collecting preliminary\nevidence, step number two.\n\n314\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.861\nWanna understand that a lot of times,\ncollecting preliminary evidence is\n\n315\n00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:19.588\nreally nothing more than simply\nunderstanding how to secure the scene.\n\n316\n00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:24.190\nAnd my point with the whole CHFI,\nCSI forensic thing was in these movies,\n\n317\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.088\nin these TV shows, what you often see is\nthat the initial first response to show\n\n318\n00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:33.550\nup the security scene put up\nthe caution do not cross tape all that.\n\n319\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.540\nAnd then what happens is the people\nthat are trained to show up\n\n320\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.150\nstart to come in and just even put\ndown these yellow number tents, right.\n\n321\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.110\nYou're number one, number two,\n\n322\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.680\nnumber three,\nevery time they find a piece of evidence.\n\n323\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.890\nAnd then they start\nphotographing everything.\n\n324\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.210\nAnd nothing gets touched, nothing is done,\n\n325\n00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.990\nuntil everything is mapped out and\neverything is identified with a number so\n\n326\n00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.730\nyou could track that piece of\nevidence in relation to others.\n\n327\n00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.500\nAnd then, everything is captured so\n\n328\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.980\nwe have a complete context map of where\neverything was, and the state it was in,\n\n329\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.910\nright, at the moment that, essentially,\nwe started to do the investigation.\n\n330\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.250\nSo step two, right,\ncollect preliminary evidence.\n\n331\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.010\nStep number three, obtain a court warrant.\n\n332\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:15.030\nNow if we have to discover or cease\nevidence we may or may not need a warrant.\n\n333\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.190\nWe'll get into this in one of\nour upcoming discussions about\n\n334\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.020\nwhen we do need a warrant, when do we\nneed a warrant to do legal searchers,\n\n335\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.680\nwhen can we search without a warrant.\n\n336\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.350\nYou may be surprised to find out at least\nin the United States anyway, this varies\n\n337\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.190\nby country and varies by jurisdictional\narea and so it varies based on law.\n\n338\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.700\nBut there are times in the United States\nand in many countries around the world\n\n339\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.960\nwhere you will need under court\norder a warrant signed by a judge or\n\n340\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.470\na legal representative to give\nyou authority to do a search.\n\n341\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.250\nThere are many instances where you do not.\n\n342\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.330\nYou being a qualified agent or\nrepresentative for the government or\n\n343\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.450\nthe entity, right,\nthat is doing the search.\n\n344\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.358\nSo myself, Daniel, is just\nessentially private citizens, right.\n\n345\n00:15:52.358 --> 00:15:56.534\nWe are not authorized to act on behalf\nof a government agency normally and\n\n346\n00:15:56.534 --> 00:15:57.290\ndo a search.\n\n347\n00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.230\nBut interestingly we actually can operate\noutside of the normal framework of\n\n348\n00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.780\nthat law.\n\n349\n00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.988\nAnd if we do the search we don't\nneed to have a warrant but\n\n350\n00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:07.220\nlaw enforcement agencies do.\n\n351\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.642\nAnd so what we'll often find is that\nessentially somebody's who's not an agent\n\n352\n00:16:11.642 --> 00:16:16.001\nof the law enforcement community can do\na search under different circumstances\n\n353\n00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:17.835\nbecause they are not bound by it.\n\n354\n00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:21.411\nThe same laws and therefore the same\nrestrictions that an authorized or\n\n355\n00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:22.760\nsworn agent would be.\n\n356\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.510\nSo it's interesting.\n\n357\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.150\nWe'll talk about some\nof those distinctions.\n\n358\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.660\nSo we may or\nmay not need a court warrant or\n\n359\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.270\na court order to do evidence search and\nseizure.\n\n360\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.340\nWe'll talk about that.\n\n361\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.820\nSo that's kinda one of those if required\nput a little asterisk next to that one.\n\n362\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.137\nWe may or may not need that one.\n\n363\n00:16:36.137 --> 00:16:41.292\nAnd there's also a question off exigent\ncircumstance and this question of time,\n\n364\n00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:45.340\nif you can prove that it would have\ntaken to long to get a warning.\n\n365\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.660\nAnd evidence could have been destroyed or\nevidence potentially\n\n366\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.170\nthat would have been valuable, would have\nsomehow been modified, had you waited.\n\n367\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.450\nThere is a clause that allows you on your\nmost loss to execute such with a warning\n\n368\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.850\nand especially define circumstances\nnotice exigent circumstance.\n\n369\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.350\nSo there is a lot of grey\n\n370\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.220\nquote unquote early in the sense we\nhave to really understand the mention,\n\n371\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.560\nthe finite points of the law that we\noperate under as a forensic investigator\n\n372\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.260\nto understand when it is and it is\nnot appropriate to do certain things.\n\n373\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.180\nSo that's something we'll come back to.\n\n374\n00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.520\nStep number four perform\nfirst responder procedures.\n\n375\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.060\nWe talked about some of this right.\n\n376\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.070\nMaking sure that if we are trained\nwe start to examine the area.\n\n377\n00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:29.010\nIf we're not we secure the area as I said\nwith preliminary evidence making sure we\n\n378\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.630\nunderstand that nothing should be touched.\n\n379\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.110\nStep number five seize evidence\nat the crime scene right.\n\n380\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.120\nWe're gonna go in as I\nsaid label everything.\n\n381\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.700\nWe're gonna go in and start to do what\nwe call tagging and bugging, right.\n\n382\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.246\nAnd generically we're gonna take all that\nevidence, we're gonna pick each piece up,\n\n383\n00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:47.120\nyou often see them on the TB\nshows they have gloves, right.\n\n384\n00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.100\nOr if they don't have gloves they\npick something up with innocuous\n\n385\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.370\ninstrument like metal probe or\npencil something that will modify or\n\n386\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.260\nanyway damage or leave behind trace\nevidence, you don't wanna just reach and\n\n387\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.310\npick it up with your hands right so\nthey'll do that.\n\n388\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.130\nYeah they kind of examine it right\nthen they'll drop it into a bag.\n\n389\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.060\nAnd or a test tube or whatever they do.\n\n390\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.000\nOr they'll wrap it in a sheet or\n\n391\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.570\nsomething just to prevent it\nright from being modified.\n\n392\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.240\nSo this is the idea of seizing\nevidence at the crime scene.\n\n393\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.800\nWe then in step seven or\nstep six excuse me.\n\n394\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.980\nYou gotta keep me straight on this stuff.\n\n395\n00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.300\nStep six right we're gonna\ntransport evidence to the lab.\n\n396\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.810\nWe have to safely and securely without\nmodifying the evidence transport it.\n\n397\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.640\nNow, your listener buys a lot of stuff.\n\n398\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.665\nWe'll get more into this later.\n\n399\n00:18:26.665 --> 00:18:32.494\nBut again, things we take for granted.\n\n400\n00:18:32.494 --> 00:18:34.784\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Common knowledge, things we take for\n\n401\n00:18:34.784 --> 00:18:36.459\ngranted that we don't often think about.\n\n402\n00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:40.734\nWhat about magnetic interference and how\ndoes that affect media that we potentially\n\n403\n00:18:40.734 --> 00:18:42.920\nsee as evidence they wanna secure.\n\n404\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.960\nWhat about for\ninstance film in the camera.\n\n405\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.510\nAm told that old fashion film not\ncameras individual but film film, right.\n\n406\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.645\nIf you run that right\nfilm magnetic field and\n\n407\n00:18:51.645 --> 00:18:56.060\nx-ray field you may actually damage the\ninformation on the film and wipe it out.\n\n408\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.210\nWhat about taking a magnetic media through\na strong magnetic field like a degausser?\n\n409\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.370\nThat's gonna screw it up and\nbasically blow it up.\n\n410\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.120\nSo we have to be very\nconcerned about this stuff\n\n411\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.620\nbecause if we're not aware of how to\ntransport the evidences securely,\n\n412\n00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.550\nwe may actually damage the evidence\nas a result of actually moving it.\n\n413\n00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention chain of evidence,\nright?\n\n414\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.890\nI can't just grab something, thanks\nEd I'm gonna go run that to the lab.\n\n415\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.600\nThere has to be some sort of documentation\nthat Adam had it, transferred it to me,\n\n416\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.100\ni took it to the lab, it was transferred,\ntime, dates, the whole nine yards.\n\n417\n00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.230\nTo make sure that it wasn't tampered\nwith any way or shape of form.\n\n418\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.510\nCan't just walk it on over there and\nhave your way with it.\n\n419\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.778\nThat's something that we take for granted\nas just a normal person on the street.\n\n420\n00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:39.096\nWe can't do that when\nwe are an investigator.\n\n421\n00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:41.620\n&gt;&gt; Very true,\nDaniel raises an excellent point.\n\n422\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.223\nWhich is that everything we do, every\nstep literally, every touch, every look,\n\n423\n00:19:46.223 --> 00:19:50.628\nhas to be documented, from the time we\ndiscover the evidence until the time it is\n\n424\n00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:55.340\neither returned to the owner, at the end\nof this very lengthy process potentially.\n\n425\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.099\nIt is destroyed and or\nis deemed no longer valuable,\n\n426\n00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:01.991\nbecause if under any of those\ncircumstances between those two book ends,\n\n427\n00:20:01.991 --> 00:20:04.437\nwe engage an activity\nthat is not documented,\n\n428\n00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:08.640\nwe have damaged the credibility and the\nintegrity of that evidence, and done so\n\n429\n00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.055\nin a way that most likely\nrenders it useless.\n\n430\n00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:15.310\nAnd we cannot then use it at that point or\nany point afterwards going forward.\n\n431\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.810\nAnd this happens unfortunately quite a bit\n\n432\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.100\neven though we take steps to\nprevent it from happening.\n\n433\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.850\nOne mistake,\n\n434\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:26.050\none ill thought out opportunity to access\ninformation without following procedure.\n\n435\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.430\nAnd unfortunately you deal with\na break in the chain of custody.\n\n436\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.370\nAnd as a result as Daniel pointed out,\n\n437\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.645\nwe then render that information\nuseless that is very important.\n\n438\n00:20:33.645 --> 00:20:37.340\nSo I could tell you stories [LAUGH]\nabout people transporting evidence\n\n439\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.950\nin ways that would just make\nyour hair stand on end.\n\n440\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.710\nPeople putting evidence into the back of\ntheir car, just throwing it on the seat.\n\n441\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.596\nLeaving it there driving around\nwith it forgetting to turn it in.\n\n442\n00:20:48.596 --> 00:20:51.771\nAre people throwing it in their trunk,\nletting it seat in their trunk and\n\n443\n00:20:51.771 --> 00:20:53.640\nbake for hours on end.\n\n444\n00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.780\nJust random stuff that people\njust kind of don't think through.\n\n445\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.910\nNot I'm sure, and\nI really do fundamentally believe.\n\n446\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.200\nThat is not because people purposely for\nthe most part set out to do damage right\n\n447\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.300\nbut I think it's just because we just\ntotally stop and think about what happens\n\n448\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.460\nwhen I throw that hard drive out of the\ncomputer into the back seat of my car just\n\n449\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.350\nlike bang around in there until I get to\nwhere I'm going as supposed in putting\n\n450\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.270\ninto the new essential coffin cakes you\ngot box and phone installation on it.\n\n451\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.390\nCut out so you can secure the drive,\n\n452\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.270\nput the drive in a static bag,\nan anti-static bag.\n\n453\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.410\nYou wouldn't wanna put it in a static bag.\n\n454\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.455\nThat would be bad, right?\n\n455\n00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:30.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here, let me take that drive and\n\n456\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.100\nerase it for you,\nrub it on the carpet a little bit.\n\n457\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.090\n&gt;&gt; Here, run this electrical charge on it,\nthat's fine.\n\n458\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.400\n&gt;&gt; A couple of battery clips on the side,\nright?\n\n459\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.960\nSo we don't wanna put in a static bag.\n\n460\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.200\nWe call the anti-static bags.\n\n461\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.220\nSo you wanna put in anti-static bag,\nyou wanna wrap it,\n\n462\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.480\nyou wanna stick it in the coffin case\nessentially inside the foam insulation,\n\n463\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.200\nin a cut out kind of design for\nthe size of that drive.\n\n464\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.848\nEither standing up horizontally,\nlaying down, standing up vertically,\n\n465\n00:21:53.848 --> 00:21:57.895\nit doesn't matter how you do it, secure it\nin there, these are In those cases like,\n\n466\n00:21:57.895 --> 00:22:00.016\nPelican cases or things like that, right?\n\n467\n00:22:00.016 --> 00:22:02.240\nSo, we've often seen hard side cases.\n\n468\n00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.537\nYou'll then gonna secure that, typically,\non inside of an area, like a trunk or\n\n469\n00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:10.670\nwherever it may be, and you're then\ngonna drive that to where you're going.\n\n470\n00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.814\nYou're gonna sign it in and you'll then\ngonna place that in a secure evidence lock\n\n471\n00:22:14.814 --> 00:22:19.081\nup, in a humidity controlled, climate\ncontrolled, electrostatic controlled,\n\n472\n00:22:19.081 --> 00:22:22.386\nelectromagnetic radiation\ncontrolled environment where it's\n\n473\n00:22:22.386 --> 00:22:23.728\nessentially clean room.\n\n474\n00:22:23.728 --> 00:22:25.860\nAnd that's where you gonna unpack and\n\n475\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.928\ndo the examination of the device ,the\nevidence that maybe found there.\n\n476\n00:22:29.928 --> 00:22:32.040\nSo we have to transport it securely.\n\n477\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.520\nThis brings up the idea of having what's\ncalled an evidence custodian on site.\n\n478\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.320\nThis is somebody who's in charge of the\ncrime scene from a forensic standpoint.\n\n479\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.180\nWe often call them the lead forensics\ntechnician or lead investigator on site.\n\n480\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.800\nThis is the person that everybody checks\nin with, and says, hey I found this over\n\n481\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.750\nthere, I did these five things\nyou told me you needed me to do.\n\n482\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:55.169\nIts now got a unique identifier, it is in\nan evidence bag, I'm handing it to you and\n\n483\n00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:56.638\nyou're gonna check it in.\n\n484\n00:22:56.638 --> 00:22:59.977\nAnd this is the person that keeps\nessentially a log of everything found, and\n\n485\n00:22:59.977 --> 00:23:04.030\nis responsible for ultimately collecting\nall the evidence and then transporting.\n\n486\n00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.420\nThat's the evidence custodian,\nthe person on site that does this.\n\n487\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.240\nSo that's gonna be part of step six.\n\n488\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.850\nStep seven, create the two bitstream or\neight bitstream,\n\n489\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.040\nmultiple bitstream copies,\ntypically are created.\n\n490\n00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.980\nBut create bitstream\ncopies of the evidence.\n\n491\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.046\nThis is if it's obviously digital\nevidence, it's all electronic and\n\n492\n00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:23.465\nit is not electronic It's gonna be\ndigital rather that's what I mean to say.\n\n493\n00:23:23.465 --> 00:23:27.315\nIf it is a hard drive and if it is\na some sort of media whatever it is,\n\n494\n00:23:27.315 --> 00:23:30.188\nwe gonna copy that information,\nwe gonna do so.\n\n495\n00:23:30.188 --> 00:23:32.017\nWe gonna friends that sounds way.\n\n496\n00:23:32.017 --> 00:23:33.851\nWhen we make a copy of something,\n\n497\n00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:37.500\nwe are not necessarily doing it\nin a forensically sound way.\n\n498\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.970\nWe have to understand that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n499\n00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.180\nCan we go to my machine for a second,\n\n500\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.430\nI want to show you guys\nsomething real quick.\n\n501\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.485\nSo just a standard Windows machine.\n\n502\n00:23:44.485 --> 00:23:47.347\nNothing fancy, as you often see\nme as I try to center myself,\n\n503\n00:23:47.347 --> 00:23:50.230\nat the edge of the screen as well\nas on the post, right there.\n\n504\n00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.392\nI'm perfectly in alignment,\nactually crooked.\n\n505\n00:23:53.392 --> 00:23:57.485\nYou get the point, so\nwhen we go through, right?\n\n506\n00:23:57.485 --> 00:23:59.031\nAnd we take a look at\nhow to copy something.\n\n507\n00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:01.020\nNow in Windows, right, we often do this.\n\n508\n00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.529\nRight?\nWe'll right click,\n\n509\n00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:04.297\nlet's just say on our desktop here.\n\n510\n00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:05.794\nAnd let's just create a folder.\n\n511\n00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:08.830\nWe'll call it Copy1.\n\n512\n00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.330\nAnd I right click.\n\n513\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.951\nAnd I can copy that.\n\n514\n00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.129\nAnd I can paste.\n\n515\n00:24:13.129 --> 00:24:15.358\nAnd I now have a copy of,\nessentially, my folder.\n\n516\n00:24:15.358 --> 00:24:16.535\nPretty straightforward stuff.\n\n517\n00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:17.954\nWe do this all the time, right?\n\n518\n00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:20.788\nAnd I can manipulate those copies,\nrename, and do whatever I wanna do.\n\n519\n00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:23.101\nThat is not a forensically sound,\n\n520\n00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:27.023\nforensically appropriate way\nto deal with copying data.\n\n521\n00:24:27.023 --> 00:24:30.908\nBecause while I did make a copy,\nalthough there was nothing in the folder.\n\n522\n00:24:30.908 --> 00:24:32.526\nI made a copy of the folder.\n\n523\n00:24:32.526 --> 00:24:37.369\nBut by doing so, again I modified\nthe original system by writing data\n\n524\n00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:42.308\nback to the system In a way that\nchanges what's in the system, right?\n\n525\n00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:44.741\nAnd at the end of our last\nepisode when I talked about this.\n\n526\n00:24:44.741 --> 00:24:48.546\nAnd I did the little demo using\nof IP config to display DNS.\n\n527\n00:24:48.546 --> 00:24:51.264\nAnd I outputted that\ninformation to a text file.\n\n528\n00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:54.376\nI talked about the fact that the way\nto do that forensically would be to use\n\n529\n00:24:54.376 --> 00:24:55.148\na write blocker.\n\n530\n00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:58.303\nAnd use a device that would allow us\nto stream the data off the system.\n\n531\n00:24:58.303 --> 00:24:59.926\nBut not move data back in.\n\n532\n00:24:59.926 --> 00:25:02.230\nIt's a one way conduit or a one way pipe.\n\n533\n00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.171\nSo these devices are important.\n\n534\n00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:06.765\nMaking bitstream copies that\nare forensically sound.\n\n535\n00:25:06.765 --> 00:25:09.555\nInvolves using some sort\nof a device like this.\n\n536\n00:25:09.555 --> 00:25:13.576\nThat uses write block technology that\nwould allow me to make that copy to\n\n537\n00:25:13.576 --> 00:25:14.790\nan external device.\n\n538\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:19.336\nBut not actually modify the original or\nsource device in the process.\n\n539\n00:25:19.336 --> 00:25:21.343\nSo this is one of the things\nwe have to think about.\n\n540\n00:25:21.343 --> 00:25:23.286\nAnd one of the things that\nwe wanna be aware of.\n\n541\n00:25:23.286 --> 00:25:26.369\nWhen we are talking about making\nsure in step seven that we create\n\n542\n00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:27.350\nbitstream copies.\n\n543\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.980\nNow why do we create bitstream copies?\n\n544\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.820\nWe do this because it's an exact bit\nby bit duplicate of the original.\n\n545\n00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.370\nIn other words,\n\n546\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.810\nevery bit of data that was in the original\nbecomes part of the new copy.\n\n547\n00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.148\nEssentially, the new copy\nbecomes our working copy.\n\n548\n00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:45.737\nSo we can examine it as\nif it was the original.\n\n549\n00:25:45.737 --> 00:25:49.120\nBut not modify the original,\nkeep the original intact.\n\n550\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.187\nNow, we'll talk more about this later.\n\n551\n00:25:51.187 --> 00:25:54.736\nIn step eight we're gonna talk about how\nwe secure the integrity of that copy.\n\n552\n00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:56.800\nAnd then we'll actually\ndemonstrate this later on.\n\n553\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.784\nWe're gonna use, essentially, a hash.\n\n554\n00:25:58.784 --> 00:26:01.017\nAnd we're gonna create a copy of the data.\n\n555\n00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:04.918\nUse a hash to cryptographically\nprovide integrity protections\n\n556\n00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:06.369\nto the bitstream copy.\n\n557\n00:26:06.369 --> 00:26:08.753\nValidating that it's\nthe same as the original.\n\n558\n00:26:08.753 --> 00:26:11.225\nAnd then validating in\nvarious points along the way.\n\n559\n00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:14.258\nWith regards to the chain of\ncustody that Daniel spoke about.\n\n560\n00:26:14.258 --> 00:26:18.831\nThat that cryptographic signature, that\nhash has not changed in any way, shape,\n\n561\n00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:19.364\nor form.\n\n562\n00:26:19.364 --> 00:26:22.077\nAnd as a result the integrity\nof the data's intact.\n\n563\n00:26:22.077 --> 00:26:24.814\nAnd so step eight is generate\na checksum of the images.\n\n564\n00:26:24.814 --> 00:26:26.555\nWhether we use MD5.\n\n565\n00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:32.590\nWhether we use SHA-1,\nCRC32, RIPEMD-160, SHA-256.\n\n566\n00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.030\nI could go on and on.\n\n567\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.880\nThese are all hashing algorithms.\n\n568\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.910\nAnd we'll explain more about how they\nwork in one of our upcoming discussions.\n\n569\n00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.360\nBut whatever hashing algorithm I use.\n\n570\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.170\nI have to specify that as part\nof my process and procedure.\n\n571\n00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.100\nTypically, MD5 or SHA-1 are normally\nthe hashing algorithms used for\n\n572\n00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.460\nthis kind of activity.\n\n573\n00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.610\nBut whatever we use, we just have\nto be sure that we are consistent.\n\n574\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.865\nAnd as a result of that, we can reproduce\nour results whenever we need to.\n\n575\n00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:57.927\nStep nine.\n\n576\n00:26:57.927 --> 00:27:00.690\nDaniel talked about this,\nmaintain chain of custody.\n\n577\n00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.730\nSo, it's at this point,\n\n578\n00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.360\nalmost towards the end of the process,\nthat we talk about chain of custody.\n\n579\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.602\nWhy do we talk about maintaining chain\nof custody all the way down here in\n\n580\n00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:09.150\nstep nine?\n\n581\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.850\nWhy aren't we speaking about\nit right at the beginning?\n\n582\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.800\nWhat do you think the reason for\nthat would be?\n\n583\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.260\nCan we take an informal poll?\n\n584\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.430\n&gt;&gt; There's a delay.\n\n585\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.262\n&gt;&gt; No, I know there's a delay.\n\n586\n00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:22.095\nI was just saying, could we poll\nthe non-existent studio audience-\n\n587\n00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:23.324\n&gt;&gt; Non-existent, yes.\n\n588\n00:27:23.324 --> 00:27:24.932\nNon-existent studio audience,\nchime right in.\n\n589\n00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:26.431\n&gt;&gt; We could just wait for them to reply,\nbut we'd be here a while.\n\n590\n00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:27.445\nThat would not work too well.\n\n591\n00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:29.201\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we answer the question on\n\n592\n00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:29.756\nyour behalf?\n\n593\n00:27:29.756 --> 00:27:31.206\nBecause we know the answer.\n\n594\n00:27:31.206 --> 00:27:33.352\nSo when I ask you why, rhetorically,\n\n595\n00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:36.111\ndo we think about it this\nfar down in the process.\n\n596\n00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:39.880\nThe reason it's here is that now\nwe actually have the evidence.\n\n597\n00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.340\nThat we have to start maintaining\na custody for, and a chain for.\n\n598\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.155\nWe've gathered it.\n\n599\n00:27:44.155 --> 00:27:47.805\nWe are thinking about chain of custody all\nthe way back to the very beginning, right?\n\n600\n00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:50.323\nWhere we have an evidence custodian\nthat's gonna tag and bag and\n\n601\n00:27:50.323 --> 00:27:52.495\ncategorize everything,\ntransport it safely.\n\n602\n00:27:52.495 --> 00:27:56.025\nBut up until that point in time there's\nat most been two people that have dealt\n\n603\n00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:56.855\nwith the evidence.\n\n604\n00:27:56.855 --> 00:28:00.965\nThe first responder that gathered it who\nhanded it off to the evidence custodian.\n\n605\n00:28:00.965 --> 00:28:04.655\nThe evidence custodian now brings\nit in under controlled conditions.\n\n606\n00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:08.310\nPuts it into an evidence locker\nwhere it will then be checked out.\n\n607\n00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.470\nBy the forensic examiner most likely,\nwhoever's gonna do the work.\n\n608\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.750\nAnd they're gonna start\ninteracting with it.\n\n609\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.050\nNow, we've already had two or three\ntouches we have to be responsible for.\n\n610\n00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.620\nAnd maintain chain of\ncustody all the way through.\n\n611\n00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.530\nThe reason we talk about doing it here is\nthat this is where it really starts to\n\n612\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:23.520\nget complicated.\n\n613\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.080\nBecause multiple people are probably\ngonna start using these various pieces of\n\n614\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.530\nevidence over time.\n\n615\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.470\nAnd if we don't start\nfrom the very beginning.\n\n616\n00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.550\nWe're gonna wind up with\na problem somewhere down the road.\n\n617\n00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.520\nWhere one or more people use this.\n\n618\n00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.930\nAnd nobody knows what they're doing or\nwhere it is, right?\n\n619\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.360\nAnd that's gonna really be a problem.\n\n620\n00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.660\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n621\n00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.960\nStep ten, store original\nevidence in a secure location.\n\n622\n00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.360\nAgain, humidity control,\nclimate controlled, physical and\n\n623\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.118\nlogical access control.\n\n624\n00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:52.180\nGuards, guns, gates is what we often\ntalk about with this kind of security.\n\n625\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.440\nMake sure it's locked up.\n\n626\n00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.660\nThere's an evidence log.\n\n627\n00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.420\nSo everybody has to check in and\ncheck out.\n\n628\n00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.100\nAgain, you've seen these kind of\nthings on TV shows and movies.\n\n629\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.680\nSomebody goes to the evidence lock up.\n\n630\n00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.290\nThey have to check out a file or a piece\nof information, whatever it is, and\n\n631\n00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.440\nthey sign for it.\n\n632\n00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.470\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n633\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.200\nAnalyze the image copy for\nevidence, I mentioned this.\n\n634\n00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.520\nThis is step 11.\n\n635\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.013\nSomebody's gonna forensically\nexamine those bitstream copies.\n\n636\n00:29:13.013 --> 00:29:15.800\nThat have been validated\nwith an integrity hash.\n\n637\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.980\nTo start looking for evidence.\n\n638\n00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.650\nSo they're gonna go in and\nstart looking to see what may be there.\n\n639\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.240\nThen they're gonna do all\nsorts of stuff to do that.\n\n640\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.560\nAnd we'll spend a great deal of time\nover coming episodes and shows.\n\n641\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.650\nTalking about what those steps may be.\n\n642\n00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.120\nStep 11, analyze.\n\n643\n00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.530\nStep 12,\nthey're gonna prepare a forensics report.\n\n644\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.910\nThey're gonna start documenting\neverything that's been done.\n\n645\n00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.870\nWe're to capture all that information,\nunderstand it.\n\n646\n00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.000\nAnd this is really important.\n\n647\n00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000\nWe have to create a report that's\ngonna tell a compelling story.\n\n648\n00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.147\nBut we also have to make sure that we\ncreate a report that whoever needs to read\n\n649\n00:29:48.147 --> 00:29:49.090\nit can understand it.\n\n650\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.090\nAnd so\nwe have to be aware of our audience.\n\n651\n00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.270\nAnd we have to be audience-relevant\nin our communication.\n\n652\n00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.206\nHave you ever had that happen to you/\nWhere somebody's talking to you or\n\n653\n00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:57.040\nyou're talking to somebody.\n\n654\n00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.780\nYou're engaging in a conversation.\n\n655\n00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.000\nAnd either it's too high or\ntoo low of a level?\n\n656\n00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.930\nAnd unfortunately for\n\n657\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.480\nwhatever reason the communication\nis just not really effective.\n\n658\n00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.664\nPeople aren't walking away with\n\n659\n00:30:06.664 --> 00:30:08.488\nthe information they need in other words,\nright?\n\n660\n00:30:08.488 --> 00:30:09.645\nAnd that can be an issue.\n\n661\n00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:13.825\nBecause, when we report on the findings,\nit's a very technical report.\n\n662\n00:30:13.825 --> 00:30:15.309\nIt's gonna be very hard for\n\n663\n00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:19.385\nthe people that are reading the report\nto keep up with all the information.\n\n664\n00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:21.982\nIf they're not technically proficient and\nexperts.\n\n665\n00:30:21.982 --> 00:30:24.402\nIf it's too high level\nthen people may read it.\n\n666\n00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:27.480\nAnd go yeah, okay, I get the fact\nthat you have the hard drive and\n\n667\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.572\nyou found five files.\n\n668\n00:30:28.572 --> 00:30:30.432\nBut I don't really understand\nthe significance of it.\n\n669\n00:30:30.432 --> 00:30:32.942\nCuz all you said was you found\na bunch of stuff somewhere.\n\n670\n00:30:32.942 --> 00:30:34.242\nRight, it's a little too high level for\nme.\n\n671\n00:30:34.242 --> 00:30:35.473\nI'm looking for a little more.\n\n672\n00:30:35.473 --> 00:30:37.010\nWhat was the methodology?\n\n673\n00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.591\nWhat were the mechanisms?\n\n674\n00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:39.969\nHow did you do it?\n\n675\n00:30:39.969 --> 00:30:41.343\nHow did you find it?\n\n676\n00:30:41.343 --> 00:30:42.597\nThose kind of things may be valuable.\n\n677\n00:30:42.597 --> 00:30:46.037\nSo we have to write a report\nthat kind of runs the gamut.\n\n678\n00:30:46.037 --> 00:30:46.846\nAnd it's very hard to do that.\n\n679\n00:30:46.846 --> 00:30:48.548\nSo what we often suggest is.\n\n680\n00:30:48.548 --> 00:30:51.906\nAnd you'll see some samples of\nthese in upcoming conversations.\n\n681\n00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:56.166\nThat you write a report that has a fair\namount of technical knowledge and\n\n682\n00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:57.379\nspecificity in it.\n\n683\n00:30:57.379 --> 00:30:59.082\nBut a lot of it goes into appendices.\n\n684\n00:30:59.082 --> 00:31:02.657\nAnd a lot of it is referenced\nin areas of the report that\n\n685\n00:31:02.657 --> 00:31:05.766\nfollow a general high level summary,\nright?\n\n686\n00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:08.626\nSo you have almost an executive summary,\nseveral page overview.\n\n687\n00:31:08.626 --> 00:31:11.799\nAnd then you invite people to drill\ndown and look at the details as needed.\n\n688\n00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:14.010\nAnd we'll show you some examples\nof what that may look like.\n\n689\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.979\nSo that's gonna be step 12.\n\n690\n00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:16.960\nStep 13, submit the report.\n\n691\n00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.340\nEither to the court, to the client.\n\n692\n00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.701\nWhoever it is that has asked you to\nengage in the forensic examination in\n\n693\n00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:22.870\nthe first place.\n\n694\n00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.820\nAnd step 14.\n\n695\n00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.130\nAgain, this is one of those if required.\n\n696\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.430\nJust like getting the warrant,\nmaybe, if required.\n\n697\n00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.400\nStep 14,\ntestify in court as an expert witness.\n\n698\n00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.460\nYou may or may not have to testify.\n\n699\n00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.120\nA lot of the work that you\ndo as a forensic examiner.\n\n700\n00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.960\nMay never see a courtroom,\nmay never see the light of day.\n\n701\n00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.810\nIt may just be done\ninternally in a business.\n\n702\n00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.940\nTo establish that something has or\nhas not happened.\n\n703\n00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.780\nBut you may not actually\nwind up going to court.\n\n704\n00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.090\nA lot of times, you may.\n\n705\n00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.545\nIt really just depends on\nthe nature of the activities.\n\n706\n00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:52.100\nAnd the nature of the work\nyou're invited to do.\n\n707\n00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.314\nWe'll talk towards the end\nof all of the episodes and\n\n708\n00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:56.026\nshows we're gonna put together here for\n\n709\n00:31:56.026 --> 00:31:59.417\nyou We'll talk about what it means to be\nan expert witness, what the rules are.\n\n710\n00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:03.442\nAgain, there are very specific guidelines\nand rules both in the United States and\n\n711\n00:32:03.442 --> 00:32:07.450\nglobally, by country, with regards to\nwhat being an expert witness means.\n\n712\n00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.496\nAnd you have to essentially\nfollow these rules.\n\n713\n00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:12.812\nHave the right amount of background,\nright amount of credentials,\n\n714\n00:32:12.812 --> 00:32:16.699\nright amount of experience doing this,\nin order to be able to be considered under\n\n715\n00:32:16.699 --> 00:32:20.243\nthe law, as being an expert that can\ntestify in court authoritatively and\n\n716\n00:32:20.243 --> 00:32:23.940\nspeak to whatever it is you're being\nasked to talk about authoritatively.\n\n717\n00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.324\nSo, it's not just simply saying,\nhey, I showed up.\n\n718\n00:32:26.324 --> 00:32:28.596\nYou know,\nI got something interesting to tell you.\n\n719\n00:32:28.596 --> 00:32:30.381\nYou gotta really know a lot about it.\n\n720\n00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:32.447\nYou remember,\nif you ever watched My Cousin Vinny?\n\n721\n00:32:32.447 --> 00:32:34.496\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've watched the movie [CROSSTALK],\n\n722\n00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:36.033\nright, it's got Marissa Tomei.\n\n723\n00:32:36.033 --> 00:32:37.285\nGreat movie right?\n\n724\n00:32:37.285 --> 00:32:39.865\nAnd if you've ever seen the movie,\nif you haven't seen it run out and\n\n725\n00:32:39.865 --> 00:32:41.250\nwatch it it's a great movie.\n\n726\n00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.977\nBut if you've seen it you know\nthat ultimately her character\n\n727\n00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:48.278\nwinds up having to essentially\nbe an expert witness.\n\n728\n00:32:48.278 --> 00:32:51.764\nShe gets put on the stand and she has to\nspeak to all the things associated with\n\n729\n00:32:51.764 --> 00:32:54.508\nthe car and kind of the lynch\npin of this whole case, right?\n\n730\n00:32:54.508 --> 00:32:58.869\nAnd it's like the seminal moment in the\nmovie where she gets up, she testifies,\n\n731\n00:32:58.869 --> 00:33:01.065\nthey walk her through this whole thing.\n\n732\n00:33:01.065 --> 00:33:03.964\nShe unequivocally debunks\neverything that went on and\n\n733\n00:33:03.964 --> 00:33:07.807\nproves beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthis only happened a certain way,\n\n734\n00:33:07.807 --> 00:33:10.528\nwithout giving away the whole\nending of the movie.\n\n735\n00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:14.249\nAnd so as a result, being an expert\nwitness you gotta establish your bona\n\n736\n00:33:14.249 --> 00:33:18.005\nfides, as we say or bona fides,\ndepending on where you coming from.\n\n737\n00:33:18.005 --> 00:33:19.051\nBut your credentials,\n\n738\n00:33:19.051 --> 00:33:22.515\nand so it's really important to understand\nwhat those requirements will be.\n\n739\n00:33:22.515 --> 00:33:25.791\nAnd under the federal rules of evidence\nthere are very specific guidelines\n\n740\n00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:29.486\nin the United States for what a specific,\nor in this case, an expert witness may be.\n\n741\n00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:31.728\nWe'll talk about those in\nan upcoming conversation.\n\n742\n00:33:31.728 --> 00:33:35.348\nBefore we wrap up, because I know we want\nto, you'll get to more or less the end of\n\n743\n00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:38.840\nthis conversation, I just want to talk\nabout a couple of other quick things.\n\n744\n00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.425\nNumber one, in addition to the 14\nstep process we just went through,\n\n745\n00:33:42.425 --> 00:33:45.474\nthere are what we call rules\nof forensics investigation, or\n\n746\n00:33:45.474 --> 00:33:48.977\nwhat are commonly called\nthe characteristics of digital evidence.\n\n747\n00:33:48.977 --> 00:33:51.425\nAnd this is also an important\nthought process for us.\n\n748\n00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:54.258\nIt's commonly referred to as\nwhat we call the seven Be's.\n\n749\n00:33:54.258 --> 00:33:56.805\nAs in you should be this,\nyou should be that.\n\n750\n00:33:56.805 --> 00:34:00.761\nSo, when we talk about the seven Be's, we\ntalk about evidence having to be gathered\n\n751\n00:34:00.761 --> 00:34:04.680\nand having to have characteristics that\nare, it should be relevant, number one.\n\n752\n00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.820\nI'm going to use my finger this time,\nso you don't shock us.\n\n753\n00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.242\nYou clearly are not keeping up with me.\n\n754\n00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:10.326\nAll right, be relevant, be probative.\n\n755\n00:34:10.326 --> 00:34:12.432\nWe'll explain what probative\nis in just a minute.\n\n756\n00:34:12.432 --> 00:34:16.091\nBe authentic, be accurate,\nbe complete, that's five.\n\n757\n00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:19.450\nBe convincing, be admissible,\nso seven Be's, right?\n\n758\n00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.708\nYou have to have all seven of those\nassociated with the evidence and\n\n759\n00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:25.679\nassociated with the methodology\nwith regards to conducting\n\n760\n00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.939\na forensic investigation for\nit to be considered legitimate, for\n\n761\n00:34:28.939 --> 00:34:31.404\nit to be considered to\ncreate something of value.\n\n762\n00:34:31.404 --> 00:34:33.298\nIt's going to be very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n763\n00:34:33.298 --> 00:34:35.428\nSo, when we talk about being probative.\n\n764\n00:34:35.428 --> 00:34:39.252\nSomething that is probative is\nsomething that will create value and\n\n765\n00:34:39.252 --> 00:34:42.876\nthrough examination allow us to\nshow that something has value or\n\n766\n00:34:42.876 --> 00:34:44.588\nis relevant in some way.\n\n767\n00:34:44.588 --> 00:34:46.254\nSo, that's gonna be important for\n\n768\n00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:48.592\nus to make sure that we\nare thinking about as well.\n\n769\n00:34:48.592 --> 00:34:50.223\nSo, understand the seven Be's.\n\n770\n00:34:50.223 --> 00:34:51.137\nIt's going to be very important.\n\n771\n00:34:51.137 --> 00:34:53.190\nDo you have anything you wanna add\nto the seven Be's, like a C, D,\n\n772\n00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.751\nE or F or maybe a G?\n\n773\n00:34:53.751 --> 00:34:57.115\n&gt;&gt; No, I have some Zs but that's later.\n\n774\n00:34:57.115 --> 00:34:59.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or an F5 or C sharp, Zs come later.\n\n775\n00:34:59.148 --> 00:34:59.977\nAll right, very good.\n\n776\n00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:01.421\nSo remember the seven Be's,\n\n777\n00:35:01.421 --> 00:35:04.440\nremember the 14 step methodology\nprocess we talked about.\n\n778\n00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.220\nIn addition to that, we're gonna take\none more quick look, at the end of this\n\n779\n00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.197\nepisode, we're gonna just talk\nabout the fact that we're gonna do,\n\n780\n00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:13.610\nwe're gonna come back and do it,\n\n781\n00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.053\nbut I'm gonna show you in the next episode\nor the next show or whatever we call it.\n\n782\n00:35:17.053 --> 00:35:18.752\nThe next thing we do after this one,\n\n783\n00:35:18.752 --> 00:35:21.814\nI'm gonna show you how to actually\ntake some of this information\n\n784\n00:35:21.814 --> 00:35:25.397\nthat you may gather and how you can start\nto begin to make people aware of it.\n\n785\n00:35:25.397 --> 00:35:29.090\nBefore we actually wrap up our\nintroductory conversations, we're gonna\n\n786\n00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.544\ntake a look at what you do when you\nhave to file an investigative claim or\n\n787\n00:35:32.544 --> 00:35:36.235\nfile a report and make somebody like\nthe FBI, or the federal authorities,\n\n788\n00:35:36.235 --> 00:35:40.420\nor law enforcement agencies, aware of the\ninformation the that you may have found.\n\n789\n00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.548\nWe'll take a look at how to do that.\n\n790\n00:35:41.548 --> 00:35:44.544\nAlong with a couple of other interesting\nthings as we wrap up our beginning\n\n791\n00:35:44.544 --> 00:35:45.280\nconversations.\n\n792\n00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.256\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell Al,\n\n793\n00:35:46.256 --> 00:35:50.591\nreally awesome job of actually\nacclimating us to what it's like to be in\n\n794\n00:35:50.591 --> 00:35:53.570\nforensics investigating and\ncomputer crimes.\n\n795\n00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.339\nAnd that's very interesting stuff,\na lot of information,\n\n796\n00:35:56.339 --> 00:35:58.631\nwe're gonna cover a lot\nof ground in this series.\n\n797\n00:35:58.631 --> 00:36:02.337\nBut at least now we have kind of a road\nmap of what's going on, where we're going,\n\n798\n00:36:02.337 --> 00:36:04.020\nand how we're gonna get there.\n\n799\n00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.510\nThat being said, Allan, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n800\n00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.318\nWe do thank you guys for watching, but\n\n801\n00:36:08.318 --> 00:36:11.580\nlooks like that clock has ticked\nits last tock for this episode.\n\n802\n00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.927\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n803\n00:36:15.927 --> 00:36:17.980\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna cut you off and\nsay I'm Allan Gordon.\n\n804\n00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.003\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n805\n00:36:19.003 --> 00:36:21.337\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n806\n00:36:21.337 -->

00:00:13.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.978\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:17.442\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:21.450\nAnd in today's episode, we're coming\nback with more on our CHFI series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.500\nJoining us back to the studio again for\na little more on what it's like to be\n\n8\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.860\na CHFI in today's world,\nour good friend mister Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.957\nAdam, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:31.697\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da.\n\n11\n00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll do a pen and tower thing.\n\n12\n00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.803\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna speak.\n\n13\n00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:36.478\n&gt;&gt; He's not gonna speak today.\n\n14\n00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.051\n&gt;&gt; He's just gonna do\neverything the whole episode.\n\n15\n00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:39.049\nEverything's great.\n\n16\n00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.850\n&gt;&gt; Everything's going well.\n\n17\n00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.864\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everything's going well\n\n18\n00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:42.460\nglad to be back.\n\n19\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.370\nSo we wanted to just unwrapping up\nour conversations around some of\n\n20\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.650\nthe introductory knowledge regards the,\nyeah what's CHFI something means.\n\n21\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.850\nWhat it means to become a forensic\ninvestigator, how we do so\n\n22\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.990\nin the digital world.\n\n23\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.400\nWe've lay down some information hopeful\nto prove to be beneficial for us.\n\n24\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.730\nTalked about some of\nthe foundational knowledge.\n\n25\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.218\nWhat the 7 B's or\nrules of forensic investigation are.\n\n26\n00:01:03.218 --> 00:01:06.856\nWe've talked about the 14 step methodology\nwith regards to how to conduct and\n\n27\n00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:08.040\ninvestigation.\n\n28\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.560\nTalked about and\n\n29\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.490\ncentered on the focus with regards to\nchain of custody, why that's so important.\n\n30\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.460\nAnd we've also talked about the requisite\nor prerequisite foundational knowledge\n\n31\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.830\nthat helps us to really be better\nat our job of unraveling and\n\n32\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.850\ninvestigating, by understanding\nhow things happen.\n\n33\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850\nAnd what we wanna do is\nround out that conversation,\n\n34\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.800\nkind of bring it all together,\ntie it up in a nice bow for\n\n35\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.940\nyou, little Origami with\ndigital forensics here.\n\n36\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.420\nAnd so I just want to throw a couple\nof other things out there for\n\n37\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.230\nyou quickly as we wrap up.\n\n38\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.540\nAnd one of the first concepts or thoughts\nis this idea of what we call corporate\n\n39\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.750\ninvestigation, or where we tend to\nfocus the majority of our activities\n\n40\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.570\nwith regards to being a forensic\ninvestigator in the corporate space,\n\n41\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.330\nis around the activities of the business.\n\n42\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.790\nRight, and when we think about this,\nwe think about what is known as ETI.\n\n43\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.880\nThe Enterprise Theory of Investigation.\n\n44\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.410\nGenerically with ETI really represents is\nthe idea that your crime doesn't happen\n\n45\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.920\nin an isolated bubble,\nit doesn't happen just randomly.\n\n46\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.840\nIt happens with a purpose,\nhappens with the folks.\n\n47\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.590\nPeople go out and\n\n48\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.200\nengage in these activities in\nfurtherance in some sort of goal.\n\n49\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.160\nAnd when we are aware of that,\nwhen we understand that,\n\n50\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.700\nwhen we uncover what that is.\n\n51\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.660\nWhen we can answer that question and\nfigure out the why, essentially.\n\n52\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.910\nWhy did this happen, why was somebody\ninterested in doing this or that?\n\n53\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.580\nIf we could examine that and explain that,\nwe're gonna then be able to understand\n\n54\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.440\nwhat was done, under what circumstances,\nto what end, and for what reasons.\n\n55\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.840\nAnd because we can answer those questions,\nwe're gonna then, ultimately, be able to\n\n56\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.930\nfigure out not only had to document what\nhappened, but also explain what happened.\n\n57\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.160\nSo the ETI concept,\nEnterprise Theory of Investigation,\n\n58\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.450\nthat fact that crime doesn't\nhappen in a bubble, right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.020\nIt's not isolated.\n\n60\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.230\nIt happens for a purpose.\n\n61\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.320\nCriminals engage in this activity in\nfurtherance of a criminal enterprise.\n\n62\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.800\nIn other words, crime pays because\nit self-perpetuates the activities\n\n63\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.450\nthat the criminal actor,\nthe bad actor is looking to achieve.\n\n64\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.890\nThat's something we have to be\naware of as an investigator.\n\n65\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.690\nI'm not suggesting for a minute, because\nI have this conversation sometimes with\n\n66\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.000\npeople, and they say, so\nyou mean there's no randomness?\n\n67\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.850\nThe people just don't do things\nrandomly for no good reason?\n\n68\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.920\nListen, I'm sure that there's\nrandomness in the world.\n\n69\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.730\nYou only have to look at\nthe headlines to understand that.\n\n70\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.550\nBut what I'm suggesting is, and\nwhat we suggest by this theory,\n\n71\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.190\nis not that there's not randomness, but\nthat when we look below what's seemingly\n\n72\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.180\nis random, with regards to crime, we often\nfind that there's underlying reasons and\n\n73\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.540\nan underlying causation, or\ncausal linkage between the crime and\n\n74\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.580\nsomething that somebody\nwas looking to accomplish.\n\n75\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.300\nAnd we can examine that, understand that,\ncapture that, be aware of that,\n\n76\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.370\ndocument that, and explain that,\nwe've done our job as an investigator.\n\n77\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.190\nIf we can't, we're missing some\ncrucial pieces of information.\n\n78\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.740\nWe just haven't done our job.\n\n79\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.469\nWe just don't really understand fully\nwhat went on and the reasons why.\n\n80\n00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.767\n&gt;&gt; Well it's like you said,\n\n81\n00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:57.311\nwe're really trying to uncover\nthe truth behind the scenario itself.\n\n82\n00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:00.306\nIt's not only what happened,\nbut why it happened.\n\n83\n00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.839\nThat can be very helpful.\n\n84\n00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Good way of thinking about it,\nI actually like that a lot.\n\n85\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.990\nI hadn't thought about it that way,\n\n86\n00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.900\nbut we're essentially trying to\nuncover the truth, as Daniel puts it.\n\n87\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.570\nI think it's a great way\nof thinking about it.\n\n88\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.875\nSo to that end,\nlet's uncover some truth on my machine.\n\n89\n00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:16.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right there that was awesome.\n\n90\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.800\nI like that, that was good.\n\n91\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.890\nI gotta do that more often.\n\n92\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.680\nIf I do this again, would it go?\n\n93\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.324\nNo, see it doesn't go away.\n\n94\n00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:22.249\n&gt;&gt; You can't stop it.\n&gt;&gt; It's only a one-time thing.\n\n95\n00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.771\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.269\n&gt;&gt; I guess I gotta shake my [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You used all your magic.\n\n97\n00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:25.047\n&gt;&gt; I used it all.\n\n98\n00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:25.848\nYeah, no more jazz hands.\n\n99\n00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:26.451\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was worth it.\n\n100\n00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.369\n&gt;&gt; They're only there for a second.\n\n101\n00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:29.400\nAnyway, see, now it did it.\n\n102\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.097\nThere's a delay.\n\n103\n00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:32.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n104\n00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, okay, there we go, good job.\n\n105\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.050\nAll right, so,\nlet's take a look at a couple of things.\n\n106\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.500\nI mentioned that there's some activities,\n\n107\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.500\nthings that we have to engage in as\nan examiner, as an investigator.\n\n108\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.835\nOne of them is, we're to do all\nthat stuff we just talked about.\n\n109\n00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.595\nBut then we get this great report\ntogether, we get all this evidence.\n\n110\n00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:51.510\nAnd the people that paid us to do this\nmay decide that they have to bring in law\n\n111\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.429\nenforcement, or some sort of law\nenforcement agency because what we found\n\n112\n00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:58.936\nis evidence is something that\nactually violates the law, right?\n\n113\n00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:02.447\nAnd I said or I mentioned in our\nconversations over the last couple of\n\n114\n00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:06.572\nepisodes, that a lot of times the work we\ndo in this area may be done internally,\n\n115\n00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:10.082\nright, for business,\na company never sees the light of day.\n\n116\n00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:12.252\nThey never go beyond\nthe boundary of the enterprise.\n\n117\n00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:14.552\nBut there's also a lot of times\nwhere we do this work and\n\n118\n00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:18.880\nwe find evidence of something that has\nto be reported to law enforcement.\n\n119\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.160\nAnd so there are ways to do this.\n\n120\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.430\nThere are ways that are right.\n\n121\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.800\nThere are ways that are wrong.\n\n122\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.650\nLet me be clear and unequivocal\nabout this so everybody understands.\n\n123\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.382\nIf you uncover evidence of a crime,\nwhether you are an investigator or not,\n\n124\n00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:33.522\nas an individual, a private citizen,\na certified investigator, whatever it is,\n\n125\n00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:34.420\nwhoever you are.\n\n126\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.415\nIf you uncover evidence of\na crime that violates any law,\n\n127\n00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.920\nyou are supposed to report\nit to law enforcement.\n\n128\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.580\nThere's no if, and, or but about it,\n\n129\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.780\nthere's no under this circumstance\nyou do but over here you don't.\n\n130\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.240\nYou have to report it to law enforcement,\nunequivocally, stop, period,\n\n131\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.400\nend of sentence,\nthere's nothing else to say.\n\n132\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.770\nThere's no right and wrong with that, all\nI'm suggesting is you simply have to pick\n\n133\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.690\nup the phone and make them aware of it,\nand let them being the law enforcement\n\n134\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.810\nagency, the authorized officials take\nover and handle it at that point.\n\n135\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.860\nBut having said that, when you do\nan investigation inside a business and\n\n136\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.640\nyou look at cyber crime and you then\nuncover evidence that may have to be\n\n137\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.270\nreported to law enforcement,\nthere are some complicating factors.\n\n138\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.400\nI'm not talking about\nhey somebody got hurt.\n\n139\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.310\nHey, I saw somebody hit somebody\nwith a car and run away.\n\n140\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.690\nHey God forbid somebody got killed.\n\n141\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.210\nThat, there is no conversation.\n\n142\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.520\nYou call law enforcement immediately and\nyou let them deal with it.\n\n143\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.570\nBut when you find evidence of hacking in\na computer, very different conversation.\n\n144\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.730\nSomebody may have broken the law but\nthere may be political and/or\n\n145\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.030\nother circumstances and\nconsiderations inside the business.\n\n146\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.580\nThat are gonna get in the way of you\nhaving that conversation right away.\n\n147\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.990\nYou have to go through senior management,\nsomebody has to be made aware of this,\n\n148\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.840\nthey may wanna notify law enforcement.\n\n149\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.710\nIn other words, it may not be as\nsimple as, hey, we walked in and\n\n150\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.090\nfound a dead body, and\nguess what, we called the police.\n\n151\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.480\nSo, when you have gone through that\nsong and dance, whatever that is inside,\n\n152\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.750\nand the powers that be have decided that\nit's time to notify law enforcement.\n\n153\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.568\nOne of the ways you may do this is what's\nbeen on the screen back there while I'm\n\n154\n00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:09.247\ntalking to you for\nthe last couple of minutes,\n\n155\n00:07:09.247 --> 00:07:09.827\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:11.139\n&gt;&gt; Which is the FBI's website.\n\n157\n00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.246\nAgain, being very specific here.\n\n158\n00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:16.484\nWe're in the United States talking\nabout how a citizen, and or\n\n159\n00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:19.110\nan investigator in the US,\nmay approach this.\n\n160\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.100\nIn your country, the equivalent\nlaw enforcement organization or\n\n161\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.910\nin your region of the world there is\nan equivalent to something like the FBI\n\n162\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.940\nin just like every country in the world.\n\n163\n00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.990\nThat national representative\nof law enforcement agency\n\n164\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.910\nwould be the equivalent you may contact,\nright?\n\n165\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.570\nThis is just merely one take on this but\n\n166\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.450\nhaving said that, on the FBI website,\naside from all the pretty pictures of\n\n167\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.710\npeople you might not want to\nrun into on a regular basis.\n\n168\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.120\nDown towards the bottom,\nunder the area called More here,\n\n169\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.370\nthey have a submit a tip section.\n\n170\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.640\nRight here, it's called Submit a tip.\n\n171\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.910\nYou can see me pointing to it.\n\n172\n00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.290\nWhen you click on that,\n\n173\n00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:01.570\nyou're taken out to the FBI's Internet\nCrime Complaint Center, the IC3 Center.\n\n174\n00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.130\nAnd you're able to file a complaint online\n\n175\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.110\nwith the FBI with regards to things\nlike identity theft, criminal fraud.\n\n176\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.810\nThings of that nature, right?\n\n177\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.040\nAnd so you're able to go in here.\n\n178\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.890\nAnd they tell you what\ninformation you may need.\n\n179\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.440\nYou'll go in,\nit says here to file a complaint.\n\n180\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.690\nVictim's name, address,\ntelephone number, and email.\n\n181\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.570\nFinancial transaction information.\n\n182\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.510\nAccount information.\n\n183\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.210\nWhere the fraud occurred.\n\n184\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.250\nThings like that.\n\n185\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.280\nDetails of how you were victimized,\nemails if there are any,\n\n186\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.800\nyou may have to provide that,\nany other relavent information.\n\n187\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.420\nYou click on the button,\nyou can file a complaint here.\n\n188\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.060\nAnd as I mentioned, if you or\nsomeone else is in immediate danger,\n\n189\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.379\nimmediately call 911, call the equivalent\nof local law enforcement, right?\n\n190\n00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:43.219\nThey're being very clear with you here,\nthis is not where you go to\n\n191\n00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:46.930\nreport the fact that somebody's trying\nto break into your house and kill you.\n\n192\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.840\nThis is where you go to report\na victim based crime, right?\n\n193\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.390\nYou've been victimized, you've been\nfraudulently identified by a bad actor and\n\n194\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.530\nsomebody has tried to take\nadvantage of you, but\n\n195\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.300\nthis is not your life is in danger, right?\n\n196\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.595\nThis is something's happened,\nyou now wanna tell other people about it.\n\n197\n00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not a violent crime or\na forced crime, it's a cyber crime.\n\n198\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.290\nIt's kind of most intangibles.\n\n199\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.261\n&gt;&gt; Well, cyber crimes can be violent.\n\n200\n00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:08.818\n&gt;&gt; They can.\n\n201\n00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:12.001\n&gt;&gt; They can be forced by it's not\nsomething that puts your immediate life in\n\n202\n00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:12.530\njeopardy.\n\n203\n00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.430\nSo I'm not in a room\nholding a gun to your head-\n\n204\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.620\n&gt;&gt; Saying login to this computer.\n\n205\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.810\n&gt;&gt; Do this or else.\n\n206\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.890\nYou're on there, that's obviously,\nclearly significantly serious all we're\n\n207\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.300\ndoing is pointing out this is not where\nyou go where you're in immediate threat,\n\n208\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.650\nor danger, or fear of losing your life,\nthis is where you go where\n\n209\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.210\nsomething has happened and\nyou now have to tell somebody about it.\n\n210\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.725\nBut this is after the fact,\nyou're no longer in danger.\n\n211\n00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:38.055\nThere's no fear that\nyou're going to be harmed.\n\n212\n00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.515\nYou simply have to report something\nthat is gone on, just to be clear.\n\n213\n00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:44.135\nSo you'll see here submit\nan Internet crime complaint,\n\n214\n00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:46.445\nsubmit an supspective terrorism or\nthreat complaint.\n\n215\n00:09:46.445 --> 00:09:49.115\nThere's different categories here\ndepending on what you want to do.\n\n216\n00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:52.675\nSubmit a complaint to the National Center\nfor Missing and Exploited Children\n\n217\n00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.750\nvery important area and category of\ncyber crime that we often talk about.\n\n218\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.530\nSo, there's different things you can do,\nand you would go to the appropriate area,\n\n219\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.620\nclick on whatever it is, is this\ncase read the disclaimer, I accept.\n\n220\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.964\nAnd then, you would go through, and\nthere's information on a form you would\n\n221\n00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:11.793\nput in here, and you would follow\nthrough all the red asterisks,\n\n222\n00:10:11.793 --> 00:10:13.405\nindicate fields that are required.\n\n223\n00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:17.579\nThis one is about filing a report about\nsomebody having either a demifact or\n\n224\n00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:22.217\na fraudulent transaction taken out of your\nname or somebody opening a credit card or\n\n225\n00:10:22.217 --> 00:10:25.950\nsomething in your name,\nstole money out of your bank account.\n\n226\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.700\nSo you'll provide this information.\n\n227\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.790\nYou go through this whole thing,\nas you can see,.\n\n228\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.550\nAt the bottom,\nyou provide a digital signature and\n\n229\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.910\nthen you attest to the fact that\nyou're a human being and not a robot.\n\n230\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.965\nBecause that is discriminatory\nrobots have feelings.\n\n231\n00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:40.651\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, that's right.\n&gt;&gt; And potentially maybe the victim of\n\n232\n00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:41.307\ncrimes as well.\n\n233\n00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.580\nSo now robot and\nthen you submit your complaint, right?\n\n234\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.600\nSo you can do this online.\n\n235\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.560\n&gt;&gt; That's robotism.\n\n236\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.420\n&gt;&gt; It is robotism exactly, so you.\n\n237\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.610\nYou could go in and do this here.\n\n238\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.750\nThis would be one way to do this.\n\n239\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.190\nNow in addition, you may go out and\ntake a look at other areas.\n\n240\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.890\nAnd again, full disclaimer,\nfully focused on the fact we're US-centric\n\n241\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.880\nin our conversations right now, but\nthe equivalent of the Homeland Security\n\n242\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.140\nthought process in the US, again, there\nare agencies in many countries around\n\n243\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.030\nthe world that represent\nthis level of information.\n\n244\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.930\nThis level of connection to cyber crime.\n\n245\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.800\nBut in the United States, the department\nof Homeland Security is now a broad\n\n246\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.190\numbrella organization that incorporates\nmany other areas underneath it.\n\n247\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.960\nThe National Infrastructure\nCoordination Center, NICC,\n\n248\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.930\nis one of those areas where you can go in,\ntake a look at threat levels, get a better\n\n249\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.380\nunderstanding of cyber related\nactivities that may involve threats.\n\n250\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.670\nAnd so you could get some information\nabout what goes on here through DHS.gov.\n\n251\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.590\nYou could see the National Ops Center\nis here, the Office\n\n252\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.050\nof Infrastructure Protection, the National\nProtection and Programs Directorate.\n\n253\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.730\nAll critical infrastructure would be\nmonitored through sites like this.\n\n254\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.530\nAnd you can be aware\nof what's going on and\n\n255\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:55.170\nalso put reports together and provide\ninformation to enforcement activities or\n\n256\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.980\nabout enforcement activities to the proper\nauthorities through sites like this.\n\n257\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.360\nSo, for investigators,\n\n258\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.860\nthese kind of sites become valuable\nto keep up with what's going on.\n\n259\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.820\nThe US-CERT, again US-centric,\nthere are certs computer emergency\n\n260\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:14.080\nresponse teams or C-CERTs computer\nsecurity incident response teams,\n\n261\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.660\nthat exist around most of\nthe countries in the world.\n\n262\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.750\nThe US-CERT is one of\nthe very well known ones.\n\n263\n00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.840\nThe French, the Germans,\nthe British, the Israelis all have\n\n264\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.230\nworld renowned computer response teams\nas do many other countries in the world.\n\n265\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.090\nThe Australians.\n\n266\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.020\nThe New Zealands.\n\n267\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.690\nMany, many countries\nfall into this category.\n\n268\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.240\nYou can go to your equivalent in\nwhatever country you come from and\n\n269\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.740\nlook up the local one.\n\n270\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.585\nBut you can see here.\n\n271\n00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:42.720\nThat any of these computer\nemergency respond team sites\n\n272\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.060\nwill talk about alerts and\ntips that are going on.\n\n273\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.550\nThey'll talk about recent activities,\nMozilla releases security updates,\n\n274\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.050\nthat would've been good to know before\nwe tried to use the browser and\n\n275\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.745\nthe whole thing went to hell and\na hand basket.\n\n276\n00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:57.890\nSo all this kind of stuff.\n\n277\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.430\nHoliday phishing scams are on\nthe rise this time of the year so\n\n278\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.240\nknowing about that kind of stuff.\n\n279\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.660\nAll these activities and alerts.\n\n280\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.537\nYou could see the recent vulnerabilities\nlist is often featured on most of\n\n281\n00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:13.680\nthe welcome pages and home pages for\nthese particular organizations as well.\n\n282\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.069\nSo there's just all sorts of good\ninformation that again a forensic\n\n283\n00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:20.935\ninvestigator or computer security\nprofessional would want to be aware of and\n\n284\n00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:25.140\nwant to know about from sites like this,\ngathering this kind of information.\n\n285\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.380\nMaking a part of what we call\nyour incident response toolkit or\n\n286\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.180\nyour first responder toolkit is gonna\nbecome a valuable set of resources for\n\n287\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.690\nyou as you become more advanced in your\npractitioner skill and also become more\n\n288\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.790\nadvanced in the things that you're doing,\nwith regards to these kind of activities.\n\n289\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.790\nBeing a forensic investigator is as much\nabout as being up to date as what goes\n\n290\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.910\non in the world, the activities,\nthe concerns, the exploits,\n\n291\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.960\nthe threats as it is about process and\n\n292\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.130\nprocedure and just being good at nuts and\nbolts kind of activities.\n\n293\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.020\nYou really gotta keep up\nwith what goes on and\n\n294\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.630\nread up on all the different things\nthat are happening in the world.\n\n295\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.870\nTo stay abreast of, to be aware of\nthe kinds of things you may deal with when\n\n296\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.100\nyou see them in your environment if you\ncome across one of these vulnerabilities.\n\n297\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're talking about\nthe Melissa virus, people are going to go,\n\n298\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.750\nthat was awhile back.\n\n299\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.530\nIt's not going to be\nrelevant to today's society.\n\n300\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.240\nYou just gotta spend time on\na daily basis of just going\n\n301\n00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.740\nthrough these different websites.\n\n302\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.772\nAnd like Adam says, staying abreast\nof what topics are out there,\n\n303\n00:14:24.772 --> 00:14:28.876\nwhat is happening currently in today,\nso that you're able to speak\n\n304\n00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:32.914\nintelligently about it, and\nactually do something in that area.\n\n305\n00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.105\n&gt;&gt; Very true, and very, very important.\n\n306\n00:14:35.105 --> 00:14:36.830\nAnd there are many other sites.\n\n307\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.600\nAnd we just picked a random sampling of a\nfew that are obviously gonna be important\n\n308\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.830\nto you but, just to go out to, and\nif we could go back to my machine,\n\n309\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.440\njust to show you, real quick,\nwhat I'm thinking of here.\n\n310\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.320\nIf we go to Google, right, the oracle of\nthe Internet, as I often refer to it, and\n\n311\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.477\nyou put in something,\nlike, security incidents,\n\n312\n00:14:57.477 --> 00:15:03.710\nright, and just do a quick search for\nsomething like that, right?\n\n313\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.540\nYou're gonna find all sorts of different\nstuff, Wikipedia, different universities,\n\n314\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.650\ndepending on what kind of\ninformation you ask and\n\n315\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.750\nobviously the kind of\nthings you're looking for.\n\n316\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.140\nYou're gonna get a variety of things but\nif you did something like\n\n317\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.800\ntrending right on the front of it,\nsecurity incidents, all right?\n\n318\n00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.520\nYou're gonna see that there's gonna be\na list of top breaches, things like that.\n\n319\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.490\nYou can begin to drill in as\nan investigator, and start to look for\n\n320\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.437\nthings that will help you to keep current.\n\n321\n00:15:30.437 --> 00:15:34.572\nI read probably 30 to 40 publications on\na regular basis, a lot of them online,\n\n322\n00:15:34.572 --> 00:15:36.280\na lot of them digital today.\n\n323\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.500\nBut I look at roll up summaries from a lot\nof different sites, trending reports,\n\n324\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.920\nCV minor, so minor.org,\nthe CV, become vulnerability.\n\n325\n00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.690\nExposure database, and NIST does a great\njob of listing this stuff out as well.\n\n326\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.670\nYou can go to the NIST site,\nthere are just so\n\n327\n00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.410\nmany different things that you want to\nbe looking at as a security professional\n\n328\n00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.070\nthat will help you to stay in touch.\n\n329\n00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.621\nDark reading's a good one, if you get\nthe summary from the dark reading service\n\n330\n00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:05.075\nwhere they summarize a lot of the\ndifferent publications that are out there.\n\n331\n00:16:05.075 --> 00:16:08.190\nThey do email updates, so\nit's also very good to do that.\n\n332\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.830\nThere's a lot of publishers that put\nout information, both in digital and\n\n333\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.830\nprint format, so you look for newsletters.\n\n334\n00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.210\nYou look for newspapers.\n\n335\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.670\nYou look for digital publications,\nmagazines, all that kind of stuff.\n\n336\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.570\nEverybody in our industry is\ngonna have their favorites and\n\n337\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.750\nsay, you gotta read this,\nyou gotta read that.\n\n338\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.030\nI don't care what you\nread it's not important.\n\n339\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.620\nWhat's most important is that you're\nlooking in a variety of different sources.\n\n340\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.400\nAnd keep in mind that although many\nof us are focused in one geography,\n\n341\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.110\nthat doesn't mean we\nonly do business there.\n\n342\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.660\nAnd one of the biggest misses I find\nwas security professionals more and\n\n343\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.205\nmore because of the global nature of\ninformation and what we do but the local\n\n344\n00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:46.455\nnature of where we live and practice\nis that they miss this connection.\n\n345\n00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:48.405\nI spent a lot of time working and\n\n346\n00:16:48.405 --> 00:16:51.945\ninteracting with people all over\nthe world, I'm not just limited to the US.\n\n347\n00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:55.825\nI do spend a great deal of time\nworking with customers overseas, and\n\n348\n00:16:55.825 --> 00:16:59.205\nI have a lot of colleagues,\nfriends and peers that live overseas.\n\n349\n00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:02.135\nThat are always talking to me about\nwhat's going on in the US, and\n\n350\n00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:05.100\nI'm talking to them about what's going\non in their corner of the world.\n\n351\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.220\nTo better understand developments and\ntrends and things that are gonna impact\n\n352\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.760\nthem and well ultimate potentially impact\nme if I have to go do business over there.\n\n353\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.870\nJust cuz you live somewhere,\n\n354\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.490\nit doesn't mean in other words what I'm\ntrying to suggest is that that's the only\n\n355\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.770\nextend of the horizon that\nJeff pay attention to.\n\n356\n00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.800\nYou really need to be globaling your\noutlook and your focus to do this job and\n\n357\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.870\ndo it the right way.\n\n358\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.930\nA good qualified,\ncertified, focused CHFI is\n\n359\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.000\nsomebody who understands not just\nwhat happens in their backyard but\n\n360\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.940\nwhat the impact of that is around the\nworld, and all the places where they may\n\n361\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.250\nultimately need to be able to\noffer guidance or assistance.\n\n362\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.290\nSo just something to think about and\nsomething to concern yourself with.\n\n363\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.400\nAs we lay down our foundational knowledge\nwe wrap up our beginning conversations and\n\n364\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.530\nyou'll think about looking ahead to some\nof the methodology conversations and\n\n365\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.360\na lot of the cool discussions and demos\nabout things that we'll do in tools that\n\n366\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.780\nwe'll use to show you how\nto practice the art so\n\n367\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.300\nto speak of being a forensic investigator\nas we go further with our discussions.\n\n368\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, well you definitely\npointed out we don't live in a bubble so\n\n369\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.960\nit is good for us to not just\nlook at our own state or city or\n\n370\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.850\nnation, as a whole world out there and\nwe are all connected electronically.\n\n371\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.130\nThings that happen there are eventually\ngonna make way to your door step as well\n\n372\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.230\nso keeping abreast those things,\n\n373\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.630\nkeeping on top of those topics is gonna\nhelp you out in the long run as a CHFI.\n\n374\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.810\nAdams did a great job today.\n\n375\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.550\nWe appreciate you dropping by and\nexplaining things to us, so that we can\n\n376\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.300\nbetter understand them and eventually\nmaybe even become a CFHI ourselves.\n\n377\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.960\nThat being said, it looks like we've\nrounded off our first set of episodes.\n\n378\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.040\nWe appreciate it.\n\n379\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.291\nWe appreciate you guys watching, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n380\n00:18:38.291 --> 00:18:40.659\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n381\n00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:42.538\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n382\n00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.105\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n383\n00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:50.803\n[MUSIC]\n\n384\n00:18:50.803 --> 00:18:53.664\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:08.251\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:12.023\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:13.382\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.727\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.044\nIn today's episode, we are moving\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:25.404\nComing back for a little more of that to\nguide our way, guide our sleigh tonight.\n\n11\n00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:26.730\n[LAUGH] Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.430\nWelcome back, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.486\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know I'm Jewish, right?\n\n14\n00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:29.693\n&gt;&gt; Just thought I'd mention that.\n\n16\n00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:30.296\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n17\n00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.307\n&gt;&gt; Just in case that comes up again for\nthe holidays.\n\n18\n00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:33.236\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But okay, not a problem.\n\n19\n00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:36.420\nI will do my best Rudolph\nthe Red-Nosed Reindeer imitation I can do.\n\n20\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.648\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait for that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:38.356\n&gt;&gt; That will be exciting.\n\n22\n00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:39.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n23\n00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:41.810\nhopefully everybody is doing well.\n\n24\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.590\nWe're gonna continue,\n\n25\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.710\nas Daniel was saying,\ntalking a little bit more about CHFI.\n\n26\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.560\nSo when we think about what\nan investigative process looks like.\n\n27\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.720\nAnd that's really what we're gonna\nspend a little time talking about here.\n\n28\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.680\nWe're thinking about the steps involved,\nand\n\n29\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.930\nwhat we need to do in order to make sure\nthat when we go look for information.\n\n30\n00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930\nWhen we examine a machine,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n31\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.230\nWe have a process.\n\n32\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.970\nWe have a procedure.\n\n33\n00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.210\nWe have a methodology that we follow.\n\n34\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.131\nSo Daniel,\nwhen I think about methodology, right?\n\n35\n00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.290\nAnd when we discuss the meaning of words.\n\n36\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.410\nAs we were attempting to\ndo before we got started.\n\n37\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.567\nBut in a slightly comical way, right?\n\n38\n00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:15.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:16.755\n&gt;&gt; So when we think about how you put\n\n40\n00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:20.193\nwords together, what they mean and\nwhat you communicate based on using them,\n\n41\n00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:22.136\nwhen we think about a methodology, right?\n\n42\n00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:24.910\nIf I say to you, hey,\nI have a methodology for this.\n\n43\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.860\nWhat comes to mind?\n\n44\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.820\nWhat do you think I'm trying\nto say when I say, Daniel,\n\n45\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.310\nlet's do something and\nlet's use this methodology?\n\n46\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.372\n&gt;&gt; I think that you have some sort of\nsystematic approach that tends to work in\n\n47\n00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:36.494\nmost general ways.\n\n48\n00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:40.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have it figured out,\nright, I guess.\n\n49\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.533\nIn other words,\nI have a sense of what we need to do.\n\n50\n00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.620\nI may be right, I may be wrong, right?\n\n51\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.770\nMore often and not, I'm right.\n\n52\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.510\nBut that's just cuz that's who I am.\n\n53\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.343\nBut in general, although,\nif you speak to my wife,\n\n54\n00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:50.855\nshe would swear that that's not the case.\n\n55\n00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:52.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in general,\n\n56\n00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:56.560\nwhat we mean by methodology is we mean we\nhave, as Daniel said, a process, right?\n\n57\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.028\nWe have something figured out,\nsomething that we're gonna do.\n\n58\n00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:03.840\nAnd that, hopefully, everybody that\nfollows it is gonna be able to do as well.\n\n59\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.730\nSystematically standardized,\n\n60\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.710\nand go through the steps,\ncoming out with the proper results.\n\n61\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.260\nAnd so let's talk about what that\ninvestigative methodology looks like.\n\n62\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.360\nWhat does it look like when we\ninvestigate a computer crime?\n\n63\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.970\nNow we've talked about some of this in\na few of the prior discussions we had\n\n64\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.090\nin the background area that we laid\ndown all the knowledge around.\n\n65\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.828\nAnd said, hey, you wanna look at CHFI?\n\n66\n00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.674\nHere's some of the background\nstuff you need to do.\n\n67\n00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:30.670\nEncourage you to go back, take a look at\nthose shows if you haven't seen them.\n\n68\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.500\nNot that you have to go through them\nbefore you interact with some of\n\n69\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.670\nthe material here, but it's gonna give you\nthe foundational thought processes that\n\n70\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.350\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more about,\nright?\n\n71\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.950\nBut investigating computer crime,\nwhat does that look like?\n\n72\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.130\nUltimately, we first have to\nfigure out whether there actually\n\n73\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.160\nhas been a crime, right?\n\n74\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.100\nA lot of times, we'll show up and\nbe asked to investigate something, and\n\n75\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.800\nthe first questions are not,\nhey, what happened?\n\n76\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.681\nAnd not, where did it happen?\n\n77\n00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.100\nAnd let's go see the crime scene.\n\n78\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.690\nBut rather, what happened, right?\n\n79\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.830\nIs there something that we\neven need to investigate?\n\n80\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.080\nBecause you may walk in in the morning and\nsay, well, my computer is not on the desk.\n\n81\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.350\nIt was there, but it's gone.\n\n82\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.810\nAnd that's potentially an issue.\n\n83\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.060\nSomebody stole it.\n\n84\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.370\nBut come to find out when we do a little\ninvestigation, that no, actually,\n\n85\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.730\njust somebody moved it because they had to\nclean or they had to move the desk around,\n\n86\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.240\nor who knows what, right?\n\n87\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.640\nAnd so it wasn't a crime at all.\n\n88\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.260\nBut rather, really nothing more\nthan a lack of communication or\n\n89\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.960\na misunderstanding.\n\n90\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.370\nAnd so what we really have to\nestablish before we do anything else,\n\n91\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.090\nis establish whether or not there's\nactually been activity that would\n\n92\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.110\nwarrant our spending time investigating\nit from a forensics perspective.\n\n93\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.070\nHas something happened, in other words,\nthat requires our time and attention?\n\n94\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.630\nAnd it may be hard sometimes\nto figure that out when you\n\n95\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.860\nthink about the fact that\na lot of things happen, but\n\n96\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.740\nwe don't always understand\nthe reasons why they happened.\n\n97\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.690\nWe don't always understand\nclearly what happened.\n\n98\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.908\nAnd we don't always understand the details\nor have knowledge of the details around\n\n99\n00:03:51.908 --> 00:03:55.640\nthe event cuz we may not have been there\nand may not have seen it happen, right?\n\n100\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.280\nAnd this is often the case.\n\n101\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.100\nAnd so we know from scientific studies,\n\n102\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.330\nfrom psychological studies,\nwe know the fact that,\n\n103\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.810\nmore often than not,\neyewitness accounts of an event differ.\n\n104\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.120\nAnd that eyewitness testimony,\nalthough it's important,\n\n105\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.180\nis very difficult to work with\nbecause people see things differently.\n\n106\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.360\nThey interpret things differently.\n\n107\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.750\nAnd as a result, you get four\npeople to explain what happened,\n\n108\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.460\nyou'll get six different stories.\n\n109\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.300\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n110\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.400\nit's sometimes very difficult to piece\ntogether what actually occurred.\n\n111\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.590\nEven if people are standing\naround watching it,\n\n112\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.710\nyou're not always gonna get\nan accurate representation.\n\n113\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.120\nBecause not everybody learns,\nnot everybody interacts,\n\n114\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.130\nnot everybody essentially processes\ninformation in the same way.\n\n115\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160\nAnd we have to determine if\nthere has been an incident or\n\n116\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.930\nwhatever the case may be that\nwe're being asked to deal with.\n\n117\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.300\nThat's the very first thing we do.\n\n118\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.830\nBecause if we can't figure that out,\nif we don't know definitively something's\n\n119\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.750\nhappened, then there's really no way for\nus to proceed.\n\n120\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.440\nI can go on the assumption that you\nswear to me that a computer was here and\n\n121\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440\nnow it's gone.\n\n122\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.611\nAnd we can begin to look around and\ncheck off some of the obvious boxes.\n\n123\n00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.550\nYou have somebody stick it\nin the little cubbyhole,\n\n124\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.330\nthe shelf down here underneath here.\n\n125\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.050\nMaybe it's just there and I didn't look,\nso I didn't notice it was there.\n\n126\n00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.390\nDid somebody take it and\nput it on the desk outside?\n\n127\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.990\nAnd it's sitting over there but I just\ncan't see it because I'm too far away.\n\n128\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's invisible.\n\n129\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.913\n&gt;&gt; Maybe.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:18.117\n&gt;&gt; Harry Potter brought his cloak of\n\n131\n00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.712\ninvisibility, placed it on the computer.\n\n132\n00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:21.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's there, but I'm just not seeing it.\n\n133\n00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:23.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe I haven't had enough coffee.\n\n134\n00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:24.681\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n135\n00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:28.260\n&gt;&gt; And as a result, the ocular system\nhas not actually kicked in yet.\n\n136\n00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.650\nBecause until I put enough caffeine\ninto my body, those systems\n\n137\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.334\ndon't connect properly, and they just\ndon't operate the right way, right?\n\n138\n00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.840\nAnd so any or\nall these things can be possible.\n\n139\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.870\nBut it's also very possible\nthat what you told me,\n\n140\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.150\nthat there actually has been an incident.\n\n141\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.630\nSomebody grabbed the computer and\nran away with it, actually did occur.\n\n142\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.879\nIt would be helpful, in other words,\nif we had more than just one person's\n\n143\n00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.591\nassumptions or assertations,\nright, or, not assertations,\n\n144\n00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.262\ntheir statements is what I'm trying to\nsay, about whether or not this occurred.\n\n145\n00:05:58.262 --> 00:05:59.523\nDo we have, in other words,\n\n146\n00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:02.779\nclosed circuit TV monitoring that\nwould tell us in the room, hey, yeah,\n\n147\n00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.311\nat 4 o'clock in the morning there was\na kind of a shadowy figure moving around.\n\n148\n00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:08.080\nAnd then, all of sudden,\nfive minutes later,\n\n149\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.680\nthat computer is not on the desk any more.\n\n150\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.974\nWe look in the footage.\n\n151\n00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:12.300\nThat may not tell us who did it,\n\n152\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.475\nbut it would certainly tell us that\nsomething unusual happened, right?\n\n153\n00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.090\nSo it would be corroborative evidence.\n\n154\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.456\nWe could use that to\nestablish a rough timeline,\n\n155\n00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:23.770\ncould use it to establish the fact\nthat something did occur.\n\n156\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.330\nAre there motion sensors that were\ntriggered somewhere in the room, or\n\n157\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.086\nsomewhere outside that told us that\nthere was something unusual, right?\n\n158\n00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:33.896\nSome thing, whatever that was,\nwas moving around.\n\n159\n00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:36.626\nAnd then we cross referenced\nthat with the footage,\n\n160\n00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:39.304\nand cross reference it with\na bunch of other stuff.\n\n161\n00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:43.251\nThe idea here, and we talk about\nthis concept in security a lot.\n\n162\n00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:47.160\nWe talked about it in hacking classes.\n\n163\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.040\nWe talked about it in the CISSP\nmaterial and Security Plus.\n\n164\n00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.660\nWe bring it up in CASP.\n\n165\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.300\nThere probably isn't the security\ncertification or track, and a set of\n\n166\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.181\nknowledge and episodes and discussions\nthat either we've done at ITProTV or\n\n167\n00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:04.358\nyou're aware of in your world outside that\ndoesn't speak to the idea of defense and\n\n168\n00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:07.320\ndepth in some way, right,\nwith regards to security.\n\n169\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.850\nIt's a fundamental concept, a fundamental\nconstruct of the architecture of security\n\n170\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.350\nin any organization.\n\n171\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.162\nAnd the idea is overlapping,\nmutually reinforcing layers, or rings,\n\n172\n00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:20.908\nas we often talk about them, right,\nbeing there one behind the other,\n\n173\n00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:23.968\nset up in such a way that we\nput our really important stuff,\n\n174\n00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:27.250\nthe stuff we wanna protect,\nat the center of the model.\n\n175\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.312\nAnd wrap it, encapsulate it in so\nmany overlapping layers of controls or\n\n176\n00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:35.974\ncountermeasures that if you get to one or\ntwo of them, we expect that to happen, but\n\n177\n00:07:35.974 --> 00:07:37.280\nwe're still secure.\n\n178\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.434\nIf you get through five, six, seven,\neight of them, whatever it is,\n\n179\n00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:42.180\nyou actually get into the middleware.\n\n180\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.470\nIn theory,\nyou can interact with the material.\n\n181\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.460\nHopefully, we're probably not gonna stop\nyou, but we've delayed you long enough.\n\n182\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.762\nWe've tripped you up.\nWe've caused you to do things you wouldn't\n\n183\n00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:55.489\nnormally do in a way you wouldn't normally\ndo them, that we're gonna find you, right,\n\n184\n00:07:55.489 --> 00:07:57.190\nthat we're gonna detect you.\n\n185\n00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.693\nAnd ultimately, we're gonna delay you long\nenough that we may be able to respond.\n\n186\n00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:03.984\n&gt;&gt; So, it slows you down, and it ensures\nthat at least some kind of evidence is\n\n187\n00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.300\ngonna be left behind, so\nthat we can find you later.\n\n188\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n189\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.950\nYou know, we may not stop you breaking\ninto the room, grabbing the laptop, run,\n\n190\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.020\nyou just may be too quick\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n191\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, you may get in and\n\n192\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.300\nout before we can actually get a physical\nbody over here to prevent that.\n\n193\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.140\nBut if there's evidence, right,\nif you touch the door handle, and\n\n194\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.570\nyou leave behind fingerprints and DNA and\nif you get caught on camera, right?\n\n195\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.130\nSo hello like me, right so your if your\npicture is up on camera right there right?\n\n196\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.280\nAnd we have a pretty good freeze frame or\nfrozen snapshot of your face right\n\n197\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.540\nI love this when we see like bank\nrobbing bank robbers things like this.\n\n198\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.600\nSo they'll show you every so\noften if you watch the local news\n\n199\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.920\nthey did it down by me recently this\npast week I guess you know the holidays.\n\n200\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.645\nUnfortunately, obviously, its never\ngood when people feel that desperate.\n\n201\n00:08:45.645 --> 00:08:46.571\nI mean, honestly,\n\n202\n00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:50.066\nall kidding aside, there's never a good\nreason to do something like that.\n\n203\n00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:54.430\nBut especially around the holiday time it\nseems like people are even more desperate\n\n204\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.301\nfor obviously very good reasons and\n\n205\n00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.311\nunfortunately they feel like\nthis is a viable solution.\n\n206\n00:08:59.311 --> 00:08:59.811\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n207\n00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:01.912\nI can go take money from somebody and\n\n208\n00:09:01.912 --> 00:09:06.670\nI'll use it for myself, but I'm not\ngonna hurt anybody so it'll be okay.\n\n209\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.920\nWell, we clearly know that it's not okay,\nyou're breaking the law.\n\n210\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.570\nBut the reality is you see this\nsometimes on the local news,\n\n211\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.900\nhey we don't know who this person is,\nwe're looking for them, right?\n\n212\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.990\nAnd they robbed the bank and\nthis happened recently down by me,\n\n213\n00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.830\nlike in the last week or two.\n\n214\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.870\nAnd.\n\n215\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.010\nThe guy, I guess the bunch of bank\nrobberies and you've got a picture\n\n216\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.110\nof the guy on the bank because\nsurprisingly they put cameras in banks for\n\n217\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.500\nkeep money so that they can see\nyou when you do stuff like this.\n\n218\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.670\nAnd so they've got a picture of this guy\nstanding at like the teller desk, right.\n\n219\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.080\nAlmost like me right here.\n\n220\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.443\nHe's got a hoodie on because I guess\nthat's the standard bank robbing thing.\n\n221\n00:09:40.443 --> 00:09:43.411\nYou buy the bank robber 101 kit,\nthey give you the hoodie, the sunglasses.\n\n222\n00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.411\n&gt;&gt; They sell that on\nAmazon I think [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:46.245\n&gt;&gt; They do, right, for $29.95.\n\n224\n00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:49.154\nAnd if you spend an extra $5.00 you\nget a get out of jail free card.\n\n225\n00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:52.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthe prime shipping [LAUGH].\n\n226\n00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.366\n&gt;&gt; So they show this guy.\n\n227\n00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:58.309\nHe's a tall guy,\nprobably as tall as you, approximately.\n\n228\n00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:01.807\nSo he's standing there and they've got\nhim dressed and you can clearly see he's\n\n229\n00:10:01.807 --> 00:10:05.562\ngot the hoodie on but you can see he's not\nwearing the sunglasses, he's doesn't have\n\n230\n00:10:05.562 --> 00:10:08.934\na mask, he's not wearing a hat, so\nyou can pretty much see this guy's face.\n\n231\n00:10:08.934 --> 00:10:10.765\nThey're like yeah,\nwe're looking for this guy.\n\n232\n00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:12.036\nWe don't know who it is.\n\n233\n00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:16.184\nBut how hard is it gonna be to\nfigure if they got like a picture.\n\n234\n00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:18.690\nIt's not gonna be too difficult\nto figure out who it is.\n\n235\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.370\nSo if we have that kind of\nstuff we could establish\n\n236\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.620\nwithin reasonable parameters\nright that something's gone on.\n\n237\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.840\nNow I'm a walk outside take the laptop\ngo sit down at the desk and\n\n238\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.530\nthen 20 minutes later,\nsomebody comes sauntering over, says hey,\n\n239\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.330\nwhat are you doing with that laptop?\n\n240\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.917\nWell I'm doing what I'm\nsupposed to be doing.\n\n241\n00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:39.460\nI'm working on it, somebody asked me to\nfix it or whatever, right, who knows.\n\n242\n00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.390\nSo it may be a legitimate reason\nwhy somebody does something.\n\n243\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.490\nAgain, the idea is we have to understand\nas much as possible going into this.\n\n244\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.290\nAbout not always circumstances.\n\n245\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.200\nBut all of the background information\nwe can gather because as investigators\n\n246\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.250\nit's our job to tell a compelling story,\nright, ultimately.\n\n247\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.660\nAnd to uncover that story and\n\n248\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.820\nreproduce it in a way that factually\nrepresents what took place.\n\n249\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.660\nBecause there's multiple as we talked\nabout interpretations of a story.\n\n250\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.830\nThere's multiple ways for\n\n251\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.620\nit to go as we've been pointing\nout to you as we've been talking.\n\n252\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.700\nThe problem is, if we don't really\nunderstand the true interpretation.\n\n253\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.210\nWhat actually occurred, the real\ncircumstances, the real defining criteria\n\n254\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.420\nof the action, it's gonna be impossible\nfor us to understand how to react and\n\n255\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.630\nhow to document what took\nplace in a meaningful way.\n\n256\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.900\nSo we've gotta figure out if\nthere's been an incident, and\n\n257\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.310\nif there has been have some idea\nof what that entails, right?\n\n258\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.800\nFind the clues left behind,\nstep number two.\n\n259\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.280\nWe talked about something like the\nforensic information such as fingerprints\n\n260\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.480\nor DNA that may be left on the door\nhandle if you came into the room.\n\n261\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.970\nNow hopefully somebody's\nsmart enough to wear gloves.\n\n262\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.860\nSo if they wear gloves, they're not gonna\nleave behind fingerprints or probably,\n\n263\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.670\nat least not DNA from their hands.\n\n264\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.680\nDoes that mean they don't leave\nbehind other DNA samples?\n\n265\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.640\nWell look at me.\n\n266\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.780\nI mean, hair's falling out of\nmy head on a regular basis and\n\n267\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.170\noff my face on a regular basis, right?\n\n268\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.240\nSo unless I wear a full body sheath.\n\n269\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.380\n&gt;&gt; LIke a hazmat suit.\n\n270\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Essentially right.\n\n271\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.660\nYour chances are good that they sell\nthose on Amazon too by the way.\n\n272\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.300\nRight on the same page where they\nsell the bank robber 101 kit.\n\n273\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.548\n&gt;&gt; Other people also looked at [LAUGH].\n\n274\n00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:20.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's right exactly.\n\n275\n00:12:20.128 --> 00:12:23.100\nAlien space suits 1995 only today.\n\n276\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:27.580\nSo if you have that kind of\nstuff floating around you'll get\n\n277\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.620\nhow broadly are we looking what are we\nlooking for, if we find a hair sitting on\n\n278\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.480\nthe floor do we make the connection as an\ninvestigator that its a piece of evidence\n\n279\n00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.490\nwe need to look at, we may we may\nnot understand that it's important.\n\n280\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.140\nBut if somebody says, hey, somebody broke\nin, that changes the entire discussion and\n\n281\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.390\nthe entire way, it should anyway, that\nwe investigate it, we look at the world.\n\n282\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.600\nIf somebody says to me,\nhey somebody broke in.\n\n283\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.150\nWe think we have a problem.\n\n284\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.700\nWe need you to investigate\nwhat took place, and\n\n285\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.710\nby the way we think it was\nin studio number four.\n\n286\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.920\nWe need you to go take a look, right?\n\n287\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.570\nThen immediately,\nin my mind as an investigator, I'm saying\n\n288\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.650\nfrom the second you told me that anything\nthat I find on my way to that room,\n\n289\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.380\nanything in that room, anything around\nthat room is potentially evidence.\n\n290\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.570\nBecause I don't know where it came from,\nI have no idea how long its been there,\n\n291\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.768\nI don't know whether or not it's relevant\nto what you're asking me to uncover.\n\n292\n00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:21.380\nBut I'm gonna assume it is\nuntil I evaluate it and\n\n293\n00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.390\nexclude it because I find it's not.\n\n294\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.230\nAnd that as a methodology,\n\n295\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.220\nhelps us to understand that\nif we cast a very broad net,\n\n296\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.490\neverything in theory is gonna be stuff\nthat will be important for us to know.\n\n297\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.240\nThen we're gonna start to\npay attention to details.\n\n298\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.700\nI know we can't turn the camera around and\n\n299\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.710\nlook at what's sitting out in\nthe back of the studio on the table,\n\n300\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.270\nbut we're gonna describe it for\nyou briefly, just so you know.\n\n301\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.930\nCuz it plays into what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n302\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.480\nSo there's a little table\noff in the on the corner.\n\n303\n00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.650\nWe put our stuff over there.\n\n304\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.730\nWater bottle,\ncoffee cup in my case, my keys.\n\n305\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.330\nI think I got my card swipe ID over there,\nand a bunch of other stuff, right?\n\n306\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.620\nAnd of course my shoes cuz I'm standing\nhere in my socks as I always am.\n\n307\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.560\nBy the way, we didn't get to see my socks\nthe last couple of episodes we did.\n\n308\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.050\nCan I put my,\ncan we do like the sock cam thing?\n\n309\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.340\nI can't like.\n\n310\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.240\nThere we got it.\n&gt;&gt; There it is, look at that.\n\n311\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.650\n&gt;&gt; So I got like the 4th of\nJuly theme going on today,\n\n312\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.290\nthis is like rocket's red glare.\n\n313\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.370\n&gt;&gt; Stars and stripes, baby.\n\n314\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.280\n&gt;&gt; And believe it or not,\nit's like blue, red, and white.\n\n315\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.303\nThe top are like white.\n\n316\n00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:16.841\n&gt;&gt; America.\n\n317\n00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:18.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool, you like that, right?\n\n318\n00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:23.040\nNow all we gotta do is come back here\non July 4th and that would be awesome.\n\n319\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.930\n&gt;&gt; They could be watching us on July 4th.\n\n320\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.610\n&gt;&gt; They may.\nThat's true.\n\n321\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.070\nSo it may actually be a patriot.\n\n322\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.663\nLet's salute.\n\n323\n00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:28.650\nPatriotic!\nThere we go.\n\n324\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n\n325\n00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.650\n&gt;&gt; So, in the back there,\n\n326\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.355\nwhat we have is we have all of\nthat stuff sitting on the table.\n\n327\n00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:37.511\nNow, that's probably not that critical\nright now, but if somebody said, Hey, by\n\n328\n00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:42.190\nthe way whoever was in this room an hour\nago may have actually taken that computer.\n\n329\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.830\nWe don't have any idea who was here.\n\n330\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.630\nWell, if we go look what's on the table,\nwe're gonna find a lot of stuff that\n\n331\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.520\npoints to me being here, because you got\nmy credit cards with my name on them.\n\n332\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.490\nYou got my car keys,\nall right you got my ID.\n\n333\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.390\nYou got my cup.\n\n334\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.160\nRight?\nWhere you can get a DNA sample.\n\n335\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.770\nMy DNA sample actually looks like Daniel,\nby the way.\n\n336\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.580\nCuz, you know,\n\n337\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.140\nwhenever I do that I always make sure\nthat it looks like somebody else.\n\n338\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.190\nBut if you looked at the coffee\ncup you wouldn't find me.\n\n339\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.530\nBut everything else you would know was me.\n\n340\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.240\nAnd so\n\n341\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.800\nthe reality is that without even thinking\nabout it we leave behind all this stuff.\n\n342\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.660\nAnd we talk about this idea this\nprinciple when we talk about forensics\n\n343\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.819\nabout being Locard's\nprinciple of exchange.\n\n344\n00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:22.695\nLocard forensic investigator put\ntogether this idea this theory and\n\n345\n00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:26.240\nyou basically came up with this\nconcept which from a criminalistic\n\n346\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.198\nforensics perspective is\nincredibly important.\n\n347\n00:15:29.198 --> 00:15:33.660\nWhat Locard's principle talks about is the\nidea that whenever a crime is committed,\n\n348\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.200\nthere's a principal of exchange.\n\n349\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.710\nSomething is left behind by\nthe person who executes the crime.\n\n350\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.860\nThe crime you know being the act that\nis gonna have a negative outcome.\n\n351\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.160\nThe criminal, the actor, leaves behind\nsomething, but also takes something.\n\n352\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.330\nSo if they break in and take the computer,\nbut they leave behind evidence.\n\n353\n00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.020\nA hair sample, coffee cup,\nwho know's what?\n\n354\n00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.144\nThat principle of exchange is at work.\n\n355\n00:15:57.144 --> 00:16:01.142\nIf we figure out what's missing and\nwe figure out what has been now added to\n\n356\n00:16:01.142 --> 00:16:04.430\nthe scene, we can begin to focus\nin on not just who it was, but\n\n357\n00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.621\nall the supporting facts are gonna prove\nnot only who it was but what they did,\n\n358\n00:16:08.621 --> 00:16:10.718\nhow they did it, when, where, why.\n\n359\n00:16:10.718 --> 00:16:12.920\nAll the obvious questions\nwe need to answer.\n\n360\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.925\nRight, so the principle of exchange,\n\n361\n00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:18.380\nLocard's principle of exchange is really\nimportant for us to be thinking about and\n\n362\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.740\noperating with, with regards to\nthis kind of a conversation.\n\n363\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.775\nSo determining if there's an incident,\nfinding clues left behind,\n\n364\n00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:27.480\nLocard's principle of exchange\nhelps us to figure that out.\n\n365\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.460\nPreliminary search for evidence, right?\n\n366\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.950\nSo we're going to examine\neverything at a high level.\n\n367\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.070\nHey, there's some hair over there.\n\n368\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.410\nHey, there's a coffee cup.\n\n369\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.860\nThat's looking for clues.\n\n370\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.300\nPreliminarily searching for\nevidence is going a little deeper.\n\n371\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.110\nHey, let's take a look under and\n\n372\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.060\naround the area where supposedly\nthe action took place.\n\n373\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.402\nLet's find things.\n\n374\n00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:48.970\nAnd let's, as we talked about,\n\n375\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.470\nmaybe put that in a little evidence\nmarker of some kind, right?\n\n376\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.123\nWe need to get one of those.\n\n377\n00:16:53.123 --> 00:16:55.270\nThose little yellow, you know-\n&gt;&gt; Little tents, yeah.\n\n378\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.778\n&gt;&gt; Ten cards, like number one, number two.\n\n379\n00:16:56.778 --> 00:16:58.578\nWe should get one to just put it on\nthe table here while we're talking.\n\n380\n00:16:58.578 --> 00:16:59.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:00.645\n&gt;&gt; So we always have it,\nso we could refer to it.\n\n382\n00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.077\nSo, you have that kind of stuff.\n\n383\n00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:05.830\nYou've probably seen them on the TV shows,\nthe movies that deal with forensics.\n\n384\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.862\nYeah, they're literally yellow two, three\ninch little triangular posts that have\n\n385\n00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.998\na number on them and then they put\nit next to everything they find and\n\n386\n00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:16.246\nthen they'll go, whoever the forensics\ntechnician is, will go and\n\n387\n00:17:16.246 --> 00:17:18.552\nwill photograph, right,\none of those things.\n\n388\n00:17:18.552 --> 00:17:19.529\nAnd take a look at it.\n\n389\n00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:22.378\nI can probably, when we do a little demo,\nI'll probably do a quick Google search,\n\n390\n00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:24.080\nprobably find a picture of one or\nsomething.\n\n391\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.759\nWe'll show you what one looks like,\nnot a big deal.\n\n392\n00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:30.020\nSo preliminary search for evidence, we're\ngonna start marking out where everything\n\n393\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.901\nis and knowing what we wanna focus on.\n\n394\n00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:35.670\nHey, there's some black and\nyellow tape on the floor.\n\n395\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.627\nMaybe that signifies that\nsomething's inside of that.\n\n396\n00:17:37.627 --> 00:17:39.217\nIt's another way of thinking about that.\n\n397\n00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:40.437\nI know it signifies.\n\n398\n00:17:40.437 --> 00:17:42.514\nWe're not supposed to bang our heads\nwhen we walk underneath the TVs.\n\n399\n00:17:42.514 --> 00:17:43.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But generally,\n\n400\n00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:44.930\nthat kind of stuff is\nwhat we would look at.\n\n401\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.914\nAnd then step forward, tag and\nbag all relevant evidence.\n\n402\n00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:49.915\nRight, we're gonna pick up the evidence.\n\n403\n00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:53.402\nWe're gonna use forensically sound\nprocedures, things like wearing gloves,\n\n404\n00:17:53.402 --> 00:17:56.531\nmaking sure that we're not contaminating\nthe evidence by handling it in\n\n405\n00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:57.570\nan inappropriate way.\n\n406\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.320\nWe're gonna drop it into a evidence bag,\n\n407\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.405\nthis is a bag that if it's normal\nevidence, a piece of paper,\n\n408\n00:18:04.405 --> 00:18:09.301\nhair sample, whatever the case may be,\nis gonna be chemically neutral.\n\n409\n00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:12.830\nIt's not gonna react in any way\nwith the sample if it's a biologic.\n\n410\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.880\nIf it is a digital sample of some kind,\nit's a hard drive, it's a cell phone,\n\n411\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.900\nit is a, I wanna say PDA but\nthat would really be dating myself, right?\n\n412\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.430\nNothing like, it's a credit card,\nwho knows what it is, but\n\n413\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.990\nsomething that potentially is electronic\nor has data stored in it in some way,\n\n414\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:34.700\nwe wanna use an anti-static bag,\na bag that's gonna protect the item.\n\n415\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.950\nMake sure that there's no\nelectromechanical and or\n\n416\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.950\nelectromagnetic interference,\n\n417\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:44.690\nsomebody's not able to get near the device\nwith another device and wipe it out.\n\n418\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:51.090\nA lot of times, people will use near field\ncloning devices that can copy data, right?\n\n419\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.020\nSo you can hijack a phone, we call\nit blue jacking, using Bluetooth and\n\n420\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.963\nnear field wireless, you can hijack\na phone essentially and clone it.\n\n421\n00:18:58.963 --> 00:19:03.436\nYou can clone someone's credit cards in\ntheir pocket without ever touching them\n\n422\n00:19:03.436 --> 00:19:06.657\nwithin probably about 15 to\n20 feet of them using one of\n\n423\n00:19:06.657 --> 00:19:10.424\nthese devices if you're close enough and\nthere's no protection.\n\n424\n00:19:10.424 --> 00:19:14.175\nThat's why a lot of people now have those,\nlike the magnetic shields for wallets,\n\n425\n00:19:14.175 --> 00:19:15.416\nwhatever they have there.\n\n426\n00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:17.001\n&gt;&gt; Little Faraday cages, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\n\n427\n00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:19.210\nit's kinda like a built-in\nthing in the wallet.\n\n428\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.280\nIt shields the cards so you can't read\nthe magnetic material of the pin.\n\n429\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you can't do that.\n\n430\n00:19:24.605 --> 00:19:27.320\nSo, there's ways that this\nkind of stuff can happen.\n\n431\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.310\nThese kind of bags will\nprotect the evidence and\n\n432\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.945\nprevent people from getting too close.\n\n433\n00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:34.470\nAnd potentially interacting\nwith it in a negative way.\n\n434\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.045\nSo step forward, we're gonna tag and\nbag all that evidence.\n\n435\n00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:42.025\nAnd then transport securely, we've talked\nabout this in some of the prior episodes.\n\n436\n00:19:42.025 --> 00:19:44.650\nTransporting securely, so I didn't tell\nyou a story when we did this in the last\n\n437\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.015\nepisode, let me tell you a little\nstory about transporting securely.\n\n438\n00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:50.444\nI mentioned that I have all these great\nstories where this kind of stuff happens.\n\n439\n00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:54.937\nSo, I'm sitting in a meeting\nwith one of my customers and\n\n440\n00:19:54.937 --> 00:19:59.338\nwe're talking about back ups and\nthe back up process for\n\n441\n00:19:59.338 --> 00:20:05.440\nthe DRBC disaster recovery back up and\ncontinuity for business continuity.\n\n442\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.080\nAnd we're planning through or\nwalking through a cycle for\n\n443\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.000\nthem to do some testing and\nget some things done around and audit.\n\n444\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.400\nAnd as we're talking, we start to begin\nto drill down on their process and\n\n445\n00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.000\nthe procedure.\n\n446\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.590\nSo, hey, this is what we do.\n\n447\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.500\nThis is kind of how we do it.\n\n448\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.000\nThis is the methodology,\nthese are the steps.\n\n449\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.118\nYou wanna know about this,\nthis is what we do.\n\n450\n00:20:24.118 --> 00:20:26.904\nWe do a full backup every day in this way,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n451\n00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:27.984\nWe go through the whole thing.\n\n452\n00:20:27.984 --> 00:20:30.481\nAnd so we're talking through it and\nat some point,\n\n453\n00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:33.441\nI ask the obvious question which is okay,\nthis is all great,\n\n454\n00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.480\nI'd like to actually go take\na look at the process, right?.\n\n455\n00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.643\nIn other words,\nit's great that you're doing this but\n\n456\n00:20:38.643 --> 00:20:40.542\nthe standing rules is trust but\nverify, right?\n\n457\n00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:44.230\nI believe what a customer tells me,\nI believe what you tell me when I'm\n\n458\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.916\nauditing, but I wanna see so that way\nI know for a fact that what you're\n\n459\n00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:52.130\ninterpretation of it is, what your\ndescribing to me is essentially accurate.\n\n460\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.858\nBecause you may have left out detail,\nyou may have forgotten to do something,\n\n461\n00:20:55.858 --> 00:20:59.100\nyou may do something but\nit may wind up being done differently.\n\n462\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.010\nSo I wanna just kinda check\noff the boxes as we go.\n\n463\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.760\nSo show me, right?\n\n464\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.950\nTrust you, but\nlet me see what's happening.\n\n465\n00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.310\nSo, we're gonna go take a look.\n\n466\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.660\nSo I said, great.\n\n467\n00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.850\nWalk me through a typical day.\n\n468\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.100\nIntroduce me to whoever does this,\nand let me see what they do, so\n\n469\n00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.760\nI can follow them around.\n\n470\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.050\nSo I go.\nWe do this.\n\n471\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.450\nLet's just call this person Joe.\n\n472\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.560\nSo I meet Joe.\n\n473\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.280\nJoe goes through, shows me everything.\n\n474\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.670\nAnd at the end of the process,\nJoe goes to swap out the tape or\n\n475\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.540\nwhatever the backup medium was.\n\n476\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.840\nAnd Joe says okay, yeah, and so\n\n477\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.540\nnow what I do is I take this,\nI put it in my backpack.\n\n478\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.480\nAll right, let's back up here a second.\n\n479\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.470\nSo you put it in your backpack, right?\n\n480\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.720\nSo that's not on the sheet and\nthat's not what everybody was telling\n\n481\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.150\nme you're doing, so why are you putting\ncorporate data in your backpack?\n\n482\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.600\nI mean, I'm assuming there's a reason and\nyou know who I am and why i'm here.\n\n483\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.400\nSo it's not because you're\ntrying to steal it,\n\n484\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.160\nbecause that would just be\nincredibly dumb, right?\n\n485\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.460\nSo what's going on?\n\n486\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.420\nAnd so, yeah, we talk and says well,\nwe were sending our tapes off site, right?\n\n487\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:03.670\nAnd we were rotating them, but\nfor some reason that stopped and\n\n488\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.930\nwe haven't been doing that and he wasn't\nclear on what happened or whatever.\n\n489\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.330\nHe just said, yeah,\nas of like two weeks ago,\n\n490\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.530\nnobody showed up to pick up tapes anymore,\nright?\n\n491\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.760\nLike everyday, somebody would come in or\nevery other day.\n\n492\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.030\nThey have a courier service, right?\n\n493\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.062\nThat kind of thing we normally do and so\nhe said they kind of stopped coming and\n\n494\n00:22:20.062 --> 00:22:23.350\nnobody told me anything and\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n495\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.798\nI have all these tapes sitting here, and\nI started to get really worried about\n\n496\n00:22:26.798 --> 00:22:28.984\nthe fact that they're all\nsitting here on site.\n\n497\n00:22:28.984 --> 00:22:30.540\nWe've been sending them off.\n\n498\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.280\nWe know it's bad of you to keep them here.\n\n499\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.086\nSo I've just been taking them home so\nthat way they're not here.\n\n500\n00:22:37.086 --> 00:22:40.686\nAnd then if something bad were to happen,\nI could always bring them back.\n\n501\n00:22:40.686 --> 00:22:44.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, when you do this long enough,\n\n502\n00:22:44.952 --> 00:22:49.221\nlike anything, if you something long\nenough, you hear things that are just\n\n503\n00:22:49.221 --> 00:22:53.572\nabsolutely crazy and ridiculous but\nthey just don't surprise you anymore.\n\n504\n00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:54.686\n&gt;&gt; His intentions were good.\n\n505\n00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:56.312\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n506\n00:22:56.312 --> 00:23:02.110\nSo where I'm going with this is Joe was\nthis really nice, quiet kind of guy.\n\n507\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.130\nHe clearly was not in any way,\nshape or form, trying to do harm.\n\n508\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.740\nHe was just trying, as Daniel said,\nessentially do the right thing.\n\n509\n00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.832\nHe just didn't know what else to do,\nand he just didn't stop to think,\n\n510\n00:23:12.832 --> 00:23:14.328\nwell maybe I should ask somebody,\n\n511\n00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:17.650\nmaybe there's a reason that they're\nnot picking up the tapes or whatever.\n\n512\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.660\nSo he just did what he thought\nwas the right thing to do.\n\n513\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.100\nAnd you gotta give him credit for\nthat, right?\n\n514\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.860\nBut at the same time you gotta stop and\nsay to yourself, the liability associated\n\n515\n00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.838\nwith what he's doing is just, there's no\nway to describe how bad this can turn out.\n\n516\n00:23:32.838 --> 00:23:36.078\nIf it goes bad, it's gonna be\none of those it went really bad.\n\n517\n00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:39.731\nAnd when did you know it was gonna go bad,\nright around the time that somebody said\n\n518\n00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.812\nlet me take those home, right,\nwas when it was gonna go really bad.\n\n519\n00:23:42.812 --> 00:23:44.311\n&gt;&gt; I have a similar story actually,\n\n520\n00:23:44.311 --> 00:23:46.656\nI was working in a corporate environment\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n521\n00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:48.990\nI kept having a user get\ntheir computer infected.\n\n522\n00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.460\nWe're up to date with anti-virus.\n\n523\n00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.320\nI don't understand.\n\n524\n00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.664\nHow do you keep getting this?\n\n525\n00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:56.851\nAnd then I realized that she had three or\nfour thumb drives on her desk.\n\n526\n00:23:56.851 --> 00:23:58.213\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I said these thumb drives.\n\n527\n00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:00.032\nWhat's that all about?\n\n528\n00:24:00.032 --> 00:24:01.734\nHave we scanned those?\n\n529\n00:24:01.734 --> 00:24:02.534\nShe said, well, no.\n\n530\n00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:04.390\nI said, well, we need to scan those.\n\n531\n00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.530\nShe was taking corporate data home\non a thumb drive saying well,\n\n532\n00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.880\nthat's how I have to do it because I don't\nhave access to VPNN from home so I need to\n\n533\n00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.060\nwork on these documents when I'm at home\nso I'll take them home on a thumb drive.\n\n534\n00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.630\nI go,you're going to stop doing that\ntoday because that's the wrong way to\n\n535\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.527\ndo this because if you get hit by\nthe bus or someone steals it and\n\n536\n00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:25.039\nthat corporate data is out in the wild and\nbecause you're not doing it, and\n\n537\n00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:29.110\nyou've infected the stinking thing because\nit was, it was infected with a virus, and\n\n538\n00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.450\nevery time she plugged it into\nher computer at work, guess what?\n\n539\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.690\nIt infected her computer, and\nI was daily wiping that off.\n\n540\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.680\n&gt;&gt; The only better part would've been if\nshe found them laying in the parking lot\n\n541\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.400\nand that's when she picked them up, and so\nI happened to need one, it's there, and\n\n542\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.520\nso I'm gonna take that in And\nuse that because that's perfectly logical.\n\n543\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't I?\n\n544\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.314\n&gt;&gt; The gods of computing provided it for\nme as opposed to the bad actors.\n\n545\n00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:51.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like manna\nfrom heaven from the sky.\n\n546\n00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Who's sitting over there waiting for\nme to pick it up.\n\n547\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So the end of the story is that Joe\n\n548\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.680\ntakes these things home.\n\n549\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.540\nSo I'm finding all this out,\nwe're kind of unwinding this.\n\n550\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.690\nAnd turns out, so he puts them in\nthe backpacks and he says yes, and\n\n551\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.650\nI said Joe great,\ntell me the rest of the story.\n\n552\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.110\nCuz clearly we gotta put a stop to this,\nbut I gotta know\n\n553\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.950\njust exactly what's gonna happen so\nwe know how to deal with the risk.\n\n554\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.570\nSo he says yeah,\nI put them in my backpack.\n\n555\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.400\nAnd then at the end of\nthe day I take it home.\n\n556\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.660\nI said okay, so\nwhat does take it home mean?\n\n557\n00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.010\nWell I throw it in my car,\nput it in the trunk.\n\n558\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.750\nAnd usually I'll go run some errands and\ngo home.\n\n559\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.010\nNow okay, not the end of the world.\n\n560\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.170\nSo I said to Joseph that when\nyou get home what happened.\n\n561\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:36.130\nWell i usually will take my bag in, put it\nin my house, but every so often i forget.\n\n562\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.390\nAnd so\nmaybe it seats in the car overnight,.\n\n563\n00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.269\nI said okay.\n\n564\n00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:41.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n565\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.640\n&gt;&gt; He says yeah and then,\n\n566\n00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.360\nyou know if it's the weekend cuz he's been\ndoing this for a couple of weeks right so\n\n567\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.510\nit's been happening over the weekend.\n\n568\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.050\nHe said yeah last weekend I\nforgot it in my car, and so\n\n569\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.770\nit sat in the trunk like all weekend.\n\n570\n00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.160\nAnd I went to the beach or\nsomething and so you know he was like,\n\n571\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.180\nI had all the wet towels all the stuff.\n\n572\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.590\nIt just kept getting worse and\nworse and worse.\n\n573\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Comedy of errors.\n\n574\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.200\n&gt;&gt; My god.\n\n575\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.422\nAnd so finally, we unravel this whole\nthing and we get like all the tapes\n\n576\n00:26:07.422 --> 00:26:12.413\nback and all this stuff and everything-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] fished it out of the sewer\n\n577\n00:26:12.413 --> 00:26:13.834\ngrate, it was perfect.\n\n578\n00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:16.433\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But obviously, the tapes, I mean,\n\n579\n00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:19.265\nwe destroyed the tapes and\nstarted over again.\n\n580\n00:26:19.265 --> 00:26:21.673\nBut it turns out that\nthe whole thing started, and\n\n581\n00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:25.380\nthis is something that happens,\nby the way, on a regular basis.\n\n582\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.130\nThe system they were using, right?\n\n583\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.560\nThe group that I guess was do\nin the right location for them.\n\n584\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.630\nYou have them setup, they were on a pays\nyou go kind of thing or whatever the case\n\n585\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.610\nwas and the credit card being used to\nautopay the service every month either was\n\n586\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.660\nexpired or was cancelled whatever and see\nyou they have not put down the new one.\n\n587\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.140\nAnd we're either notified by\nthe vendor and ignored it or\n\n588\n00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.680\njust didn't realized or whatever.\n\n589\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.490\nIf this happens in companies,\ncompanies get big enough,\n\n590\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.570\nyou've got individuals initially in some\ncompanies probably pay for this stuff.\n\n591\n00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.110\nThen you've got a big company where you\ngot purchasing and all these kind of stuff\n\n592\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.660\ngets automated, somebody just missed\nthe email and never renewed the service.\n\n593\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.540\nAnd so they go for like a couple of weeks,\nessentially they say hey,\n\n594\n00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.810\nyou're not paying us and\nthey stop showing up.\n\n595\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.610\nAnd they got it all sorted out.\n\n596\n00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.580\nThey paid,\nthey put the credit card down and\n\n597\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.820\nthey started the service back up\nagain once they figured it out.\n\n598\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.500\nThere was a lapse of maybe two or\n\n599\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.610\nthree weeks during the time\nthat we figured this out.\n\n600\n00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.810\nBut it just goes to show you that,\nsometimes you have\n\n601\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.570\nthe best of intentions and you're\nnot paying attention to the details,\n\n602\n00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.500\nwhen you miss these two things,right.\n\n603\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.148\nThis is one incidence, this is one\nproblem, this is one thing occur, I mean\n\n604\n00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:31.853\nthis is the classic example, of what\na forensic investigation can an cover,\n\n605\n00:27:31.853 --> 00:27:35.786\nthankful there was no incident, nobody\ngot the data, you know, in Dengo story,\n\n606\n00:27:35.786 --> 00:27:39.590\nyea there was a problem,there was\nclearly network being introduced.\n\n607\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.710\nYou had to spend time re-mediating\nthe machine on a daily basis.\n\n608\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.630\nThere was exposure liability and\ncorporate data put at risk.\n\n609\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.680\nThe same thing in the case I'm explaining\nto you although there was no ultimate\n\n610\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.870\nuse of that data, there was no breach.\n\n611\n00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.690\nBut, you know, who knows who could\nhave gotten that data, when you know,\n\n612\n00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.600\nJoe was driving around town,\nwith it hidden in his trunk, and\n\n613\n00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.880\nI forgot to mention that part which is,\nthe trunk lock was broken.\n\n614\n00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.580\nAnd he had to tie the trunk down with\nlike, a piece of rope or something,\n\n615\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.650\nit was so random and bizarre, it kept\ngetting every time he opens his mouth.\n\n616\n00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:09.970\nThere was like another layer of it.\n\n617\n00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.930\nAbsurd idea had been added to the story.\n\n618\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Who were the aliens?\n\n619\n00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.726\nGod damn with it.\n\n620\n00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:15.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The only thing would have been better\n\n621\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.950\nwould have been like we drill to a car\nwash and then the trunk was open.\n\n622\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.410\nSo you know these kinds of things happen.\n\n623\n00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.785\nAnd my point is as\n&gt;&gt; Investigators.\n\n624\n00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:25.055\nYeah.\nWe're gonna find all sorts of crazy,\n\n625\n00:28:25.055 --> 00:28:27.355\nwacky, just absolutely insane stuff.\n\n626\n00:28:27.355 --> 00:28:32.145\nAnd we're gonna find stuff that is\nincredibly, incredibly problematic and\n\n627\n00:28:32.145 --> 00:28:35.012\ntroubling for us and for\nthe individuals we're working for.\n\n628\n00:28:35.012 --> 00:28:38.632\nAnd we have to understand that\ndispassionately and functionally.\n\n629\n00:28:38.632 --> 00:28:40.022\nWe have to document everything.\n\n630\n00:28:40.022 --> 00:28:41.892\nWe have to figure out what went wrong, and\n\n631\n00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:44.912\nwe have to tell that story\nin a compelling way.\n\n632\n00:28:44.912 --> 00:28:48.400\nTransporting securely, coming back\nto that last part of the concept\n\n633\n00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.560\nIt's really about making sure\nthat the data that we find,\n\n634\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.340\nthe evidence that we gather makes it from\nwhere we found it to a safe area where it\n\n635\n00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.740\ncould be examined, it could be stored\nsecurely, temperature controlled,\n\n636\n00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.470\nhumidity controlled, electrostatic\ncontrolled, all that kind of stuff.\n\n637\n00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.410\nAccess control,\n\n638\n00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.530\nyou now nobody randomly can walk in,\ngo grab a piece of evidence and use it.\n\n639\n00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.410\nThere gonna be under change control, it's\ngonna be under access control, and then we\n\n640\n00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:16.380\ncan do the work we need to do as examiners\nto figure out what the story looks like.\n\n641\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.290\nBecomes really really important for\nus to know how to do this.\n\n642\n00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.050\nBecause if we don't we're\ngoing to essentially\n\n643\n00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.140\nget started on something that we're\nnever going to be able to finish.\n\n644\n00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.610\nBecause the evidence is contaminated.\n\n645\n00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.470\nIt's essentially not going to\ntell the story we need it to tell\n\n646\n00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.930\nin a way that will be forensically sound.\n\n647\n00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.190\nAnd we keep coming back to this\nidea of what is forensically sound.\n\n648\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.520\n&gt;&gt; How does that look, how does it work,\nwhat does it sound like, and it looks,\n\n649\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.350\nfeels and sounds like as being systematic,\nand methodical right this is what\n\n650\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:51.480\nultimately equals good investigative\ntechnique that's exactly right and\n\n651\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.040\nis gonna save you in the long run\nbecause if you stick to the methodology,\n\n652\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.220\nyou stick to the game plan.\n\n653\n00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.870\nYou do it line by line, note for note.\n\n654\n00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.780\nYou don't have to worry about,\nif anything does go wrong you say,\n\n655\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:07.020\nwell I followed the game plan this is\njust outside our ability to control.\n\n656\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.160\nAnd you're not at fault, you don't have to\nworry about it ever coming back to you.\n\n657\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.150\nYou did what you were supposed to do.\n\n658\n00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.450\nSo it's always a good safety net for\n\n659\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.920\nthe investigator themselves to know that,\nI followed procedure.\n\n660\n00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.430\nProcedures didn't account for\n\n661\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:24.280\nthis outlying factor that we couldn't ever\nperceive or even think about perceiving.\n\n662\n00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.210\nIt's just one of those things\nthat happened in life.\n\n663\n00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.210\nAdam I know we got a little bit more to go\nthrough when it comes to the investigative\n\n664\n00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.760\nprocess itself, but our poor little\nclock over there has ticked away on us.\n\n665\n00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.710\nSo we're gonna have to call this episode.\n\n666\n00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.020\nLook forward to seeing you\nin a part two on this.\n\n667\n00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.850\nBut as for you guys,\nthanks for watching today.\n\n668\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.050\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n669\n00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.660\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n670\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.041\n&gt;&gt; I am an investigative process.\n\n671\n00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:45.826\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n672\n00:30:45.826 -->

00:00:05.807\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.840\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.660\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.923\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings,\n\n7\n00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:16.119\neveryone and welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.698\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:21.320\nIn today's episode, well,\nwe're continuing all with our CHFI series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.220\nAnd joining us again in the studio is our\ngood friend and mentor, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.330\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.108\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello.\n\n14\n00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:31.516\n&gt;&gt; There's the camera,\nright in front of you.\n\n15\n00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:33.001\n&gt;&gt; See, it's the red light there.\n\n16\n00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:33.837\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n\n17\n00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:34.882\n&gt;&gt; I was looking for the other light.\n\n18\n00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:35.485\n&gt;&gt; Throw anyone off.\n\n19\n00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:36.461\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't see that.\n\n20\n00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:38.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, so everything is good,\n\n21\n00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.270\nand hopefully you guys are good out there.\n\n22\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.220\nWe're gonna continue our conversations.\n\n23\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.870\nWe were talking in the last episode\nabout the investigative process, right.\n\n24\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.184\nWhat's the methodology, what do we do?\n\n25\n00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:51.772\nKind of the steps involved, and we stress\nthe fact that the very first thing we've\n\n26\n00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:55.680\ngotta figure out is whether we're actually\ngonna be able to do anything or not.\n\n27\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970\nAnd once we've figured that out by\nknowing that there's been a crime or\n\n28\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.800\nbeen some sort of an incident,\n\n29\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.780\nthen we gotta walk through the rest of\nthe steps of identifying the scene,\n\n30\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.970\ngathering the evidence, gathering it up\nforensically in a way that's gonna allow\n\n31\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.990\nus to investigate it properly, securing\nit and then ultimately transporting it.\n\n32\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.400\nOnce we've done all that, we have to\nthink about, and actually around that,\n\n33\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.710\nI should say, not just having done that\nbut kind of around that lateral to it,\n\n34\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.540\nbefore, during, and\n\n35\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.610\nafter it, there's some other information\nthat really becomes important for us.\n\n36\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.815\nOne of the things that,\n\n37\n00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:30.975\nprobably the most important thing that we\nhave to think about Is what are the laws,\n\n38\n00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:34.532\nwhat's the relevant issues and\nconcerns, that as an investigator,\n\n39\n00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:37.993\nwe may have to abide by or be aware\nof with regards to our activities?\n\n40\n00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:42.242\nWe talked about in some of the prior\ndiscussions in this general knowledge\n\n41\n00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:46.765\narea, about the fact that while our\npresentation is going to be US-centric,\n\n42\n00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:50.250\nwe'll focus on United States\nfederal laws of evidence.\n\n43\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.460\nWe'll focus on resources that are specific\nto somebody who will be doing this work\n\n44\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.490\nin the US.\n\n45\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.910\nI keep making references to the fact that\nthere's the equivalent issues and concerns\n\n46\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.970\nin any country around the world, and that\nyou would wanna understand what those are.\n\n47\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.160\nEvery country has their\nown laws of evidence,\n\n48\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.400\nthe rules of evidence\nthat you have to follow.\n\n49\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.900\nEvery country will have\ncertain ways of doing things,\n\n50\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.110\nprocedures that are acceptable to\nenter evidence into a court of law and\n\n51\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.180\nmake sure it is dealt within\na forensically sound way.\n\n52\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.350\nEvery country will have standards that\nyou must meet as a practitioner to be\n\n53\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.340\nconsidered a expert witness or\nsomebody who can testify, right,\n\n54\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.240\nand is seen as being legitimate\nin the eyes of the court.\n\n55\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240\nSo all these things become important for\nus to understand.\n\n56\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.542\nWe have to, in other words, have that\nprior knowledge of what it means to do our\n\n57\n00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:42.688\njob and do it well in order for\nus to operate effectively.\n\n58\n00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:45.980\nDid you ever see Mission Impossible,\nthe original TV series?\n\n59\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.740\nNot the movie, but do you remember the old\nblack and white series, the original one?\n\n60\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.334\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen a few of those.\n\n61\n00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.203\n&gt;&gt; Ever watch that?\nAll right, so if you ever saw that and\n\n62\n00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:55.605\nyou remember Mr Phelps, Peter Graves, was\nthe actor, the original actor that played,\n\n63\n00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:59.930\nwell, not the original but the one who\nmost people think of as being Mr Phelps.\n\n64\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.286\nBut he was one of the original\nMr Phelps characters.\n\n65\n00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.002\nAnd he's the gentleman who,\n\n66\n00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:07.920\nthe kind of suave looking guy\nback in the time they shot this.\n\n67\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.700\nAnd he would go get the tape, or\nget his method of communication,\n\n68\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.530\nwhatever it was, he was told,\nhey, we have a mission for you.\n\n69\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.678\nHe would go and do that, listen to\nthe tape, it would always self destruct.\n\n70\n00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:22.240\nI always wondered, you're sitting in\nthe car, you've got the tape right,\n\n71\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.750\nthe cool 60s technology, and\nthis little cassette recorder.\n\n72\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.360\nAnd then the thing essentially blows\nup and evaporates or whatever.\n\n73\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.600\nSo he just walks away,\nleave the car smoking, or\n\n74\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.450\nleaves the phone booth and the thing\nbursts into flames, or something.\n\n75\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.660\nI don't know, anyway.\n\n76\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.610\nSo random aside, but so he does all that.\n\n77\n00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.870\nAnd then,\nthe next thing you often see is that\n\n78\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.220\nthey cut to him sitting in this kinda\n60s cool bachelor pad somewhere.\n\n79\n00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.370\nAnd he's on the couch and he's got\nthe portfolio of all the special mission\n\n80\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.940\noperatives, right, all the people that\nare gonna essentially be on that episode.\n\n81\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.350\nAnd Martin Landau was in there, Barbara\nBain, his wife in real life, was in there,\n\n82\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.860\nPeter Lupus, the big strong guy, kind\nof the muscle guy, is always in there.\n\n83\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.030\nAnd then he's usually got\na special guest star or two.\n\n84\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.020\nSo he's got whoever it was that they would\ngo through, flip out the photos and say,\n\n85\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.342\nI want this one, this one.\n\n86\n00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:13.264\nHe'd throw the photos on the desk, and\n\n87\n00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:15.944\nthe next thing you'd see\nafter that happens is they'd\n\n88\n00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:19.829\nall be magically in the room, meeting and\ntalking about the mission, right?\n\n89\n00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.430\nAnd he was kind of picking his team,\nfiguring out\n\n90\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.605\nwho it is that's gonna be important for\nhim to have or who's gotta be a member of\n\n91\n00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:29.660\nthis team because they bring a special\nskill or resource or knowledge.\n\n92\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.810\nAnd then those people are gonna\ncontribute to the success of the mission.\n\n93\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.460\nIt's really kind of the same\nthought process for\n\n94\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.500\nus as being an investigator,\nas being a CHFI.\n\n95\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.370\nWe have to understand the tools,\nwe have to have the knowledge,\n\n96\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.330\nwe have to know what we can do, how we\ncan do it, who's gonna provide help and\n\n97\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.960\nsupport to us,\nwhat are the things we need.\n\n98\n00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.760\nAnd how do we build that knowledge, how\ndo we understand it, how do we gather it.\n\n99\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.040\nAre we throwing down on the proverbial\ntable to build our toolkit, and\n\n100\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.780\nour team, some pictures of people\nthat we're gonna partner with.\n\n101\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.882\nAre we putting a special tool on\nthat pile that may be needed for\n\n102\n00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:02.390\nforensic examination of evidence,\n\n103\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.650\nlike a write blocker, as we've talked\nabout in some of the other episodes.\n\n104\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.420\nAre we gonna have some sort of a specific\n\n105\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.590\npiece of evidence that we're gonna\nhave to work within a certain way?\n\n106\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.040\nAnd as a result, we need a highly skilled\ntechnician that knows how to do that,\n\n107\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.750\nand we gotta figure out who that is and\npartner with them.\n\n108\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.794\nA lot of times in these investigations,\nother local law enforcement may do,\n\n109\n00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:27.543\nthey may find computer evidence that\nthey are unequipped to deal with.\n\n110\n00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:30.177\nThey just don't know how\nto get into the system, or\n\n111\n00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:34.343\nthey just don't have the knowledge in\ntheir local police department to work with\n\n112\n00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:35.707\nthis particular system.\n\n113\n00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:37.969\nAnd so\nwhat they'll do is they'll go out and\n\n114\n00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.169\nthey contact the FBI in\nthe United States or\n\n115\n00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.610\ncontact a federal agency that may\nhave knowledge of how to do this.\n\n116\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.560\nAnd they'll bring in experts and\n\n117\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.180\npartner to essentially get help to\nfigure out how to work with this, right?\n\n118\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.950\nYou heard evidence of this or heard about\nthis last year, roughly, where the FBI had\n\n119\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.220\nto get called in to try and\nhack into the iPhone of that couple out in\n\n120\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.180\nCalifornia who had committed that horrible\nact and had killed all those people.\n\n121\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.470\nAnd then it left evidence, potentially, at\nleast we think, evidence on their phones.\n\n122\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.810\nBut the phones were locked out and there\nwas no way for the local law enforcement\n\n123\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.610\nagencies to hack in without damaging and\nultimately destroying the evidence.\n\n124\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.440\nAnd so you just went back and\nforth, and this became a big deal.\n\n125\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.527\nAnd it actually winded up being\npotentially a court case, right,\n\n126\n00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:24.950\nbecause the FBI was essentially\ngonna have to get in.\n\n127\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.320\nAnd ultimately they were dragging Apple\ninto court to try to compel them and\n\n128\n00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.000\nforce them, federal government,\nto unlock the phone.\n\n129\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.590\nApple apparently had a way to do this and\nsaid, nope, sorry,\n\n130\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.890\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n131\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.740\nAnd it went back and forth.\n\n132\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.660\nUltimately, the FBI,\npartnering with the NSA,\n\n133\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.610\nwinds up being able to figure out\nhow to hack the phone anyway.\n\n134\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.940\nAnd gets around whatever the security\nthat Apple would have put in\n\n135\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.860\nplace normally in a phone.\n\n136\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.460\nWould have been allowing Apple essentially\nto get off the hook and not having\n\n137\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.530\nto break the phone or essentially\ndecrypt the data by unlocking it.\n\n138\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.610\nSo these things happen and\nas forensic investigators,\n\n139\n00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.630\nwe have to be aware of the fact that the\nmost important thing, the absolute most\n\n140\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.510\ncritical skill we have, is the ability\nto understand our limitations.\n\n141\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.630\nAnd to understand that there are things\nwe're not gonna know how to do and\n\n142\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.590\nthat if we try to do them and\n\n143\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.940\nwe screw it up, that's actually\nworse than not doing them at all.\n\n144\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.810\nBecause the likelihood of us screwing\nit up if it's high enough means that\n\n145\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.080\nthe evidence will be tainted and we will\nnot be able to use it or present it.\n\n146\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.690\nAnd as a result, somebody may actually get\naway with doing something that in theory\n\n147\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.850\nbroke the law and\nwas not supposed to be done.\n\n148\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.559\nYou see this sometimes in the real\nworld but more often than not,\n\n149\n00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.650\nyou see these on these crime dramas\non TV shows all the time, right,\n\n150\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.580\nwhere evidence is tainted,\nsomebody didn't follow procedure.\n\n151\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.850\nThey didn't read someone their\nrights before the interview,\n\n152\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.706\nwhatever the case is.\n\n153\n00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:46.108\nThere's all these things they do on\npurpose to make it appear as if, yeah,\n\n154\n00:07:46.108 --> 00:07:48.930\nthere's an issue so\nthat way they can advance the story line.\n\n155\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.673\nBut the reality is in the real world,\nthese things happen all the time, too.\n\n156\n00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:57.942\nThere was a time in the United States\nwhere you didn't have rights that were\n\n157\n00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:02.100\nread to you as somebody who was been\narrested, being accused of a crime.\n\n158\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.461\nIt wasn't until a landmark case\nthat went to the Supreme Court That\n\n159\n00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:08.704\nactually established that people\nthat are being arrested by law\n\n160\n00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.060\nenforcement officials have certain rights.\n\n161\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.250\nAnd they have to be made aware of them and\n\n162\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.770\nif you don't make them aware of them\nby reading them their Miranda rights,\n\n163\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.750\nthen the reality is that person, and then\nanything you find out about that person,\n\n164\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.570\nand anything they say or\ndo is not admissible.\n\n165\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.090\nBecause ultimately you have not notified\nthem that that they have the right not\n\n166\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.430\nto say something that\ncan incriminate them.\n\n167\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.490\nAnd that they have the right not to talk\nto you, and to demand that they have\n\n168\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.300\na lawyer present when they do, and that\nyou have to honor those rights, right?\n\n169\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.581\nNow that's in the United States,\nit's not in every country in the world.\n\n170\n00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:41.842\nBut my point is there are rules of\nengagement that we have to be aware of,\n\n171\n00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:46.317\nas a investigator, if I interview\nsomebody if I sit down and say to Daniel,\n\n172\n00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:50.169\nhey Daniel something happened and\nlet me talk to you about this.\n\n173\n00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:54.012\nIf I'm doing this not as a representative\nof a law enforcement agency but as\n\n174\n00:08:54.012 --> 00:08:58.642\na private individual, the rules are very\ndifferent for engagement for Daniel and I.\n\n175\n00:08:58.642 --> 00:08:59.592\nWe can talk.\n\n176\n00:08:59.592 --> 00:09:02.362\nI don't need to advise Daniel\nof his Miranda rights,\n\n177\n00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:05.642\nand hey you have the right to remain\nsilent, you have the right to an attorney,\n\n178\n00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:07.662\nyou've heard people say that time and\nagain on TV.\n\n179\n00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:11.540\nYou don't have to do that if you're\noperating as a private citizen.\n\n180\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.190\nRight?\nAs a matter of fact you are not allowed to\n\n181\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.030\nthat scam.\n\n182\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.290\nIt's not something you do because\nyou don't represent the government.\n\n183\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.450\nYou don't represent a law\nenforcement agency.\n\n184\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.760\nBut if I'm working on behalf\nof one of those agencies.\n\n185\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.590\nAnd I don't advice Daniel of the fact\nthat I'm working for that agency.\n\n186\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.660\nAnd I don't advice him of certain things\nabout my status as a result of that one.\n\n187\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.630\nHe and I talk.\n\n188\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.340\nWe're talking under false pretenses and\ninformation I learned from that\n\n189\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.430\nconversation may not be admissible, and\nmay actually taint the investigation.\n\n190\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.450\nSo there's very specific\nways I have to engage.\n\n191\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.185\nAnd I must know my limitations I must\nunderstand the legal liabilities and\n\n192\n00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:51.585\nthe legal requirements associated\nwith being an investigator,\n\n193\n00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:54.355\ndepending on what it is I'm doing and\nhow I'm operating.\n\n194\n00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:57.265\nThere also are a lot of people on this\nteam that I talked about that may\n\n195\n00:09:57.265 --> 00:09:59.285\nbe involved in computer forensics.\n\n196\n00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:04.225\nThere are people like expert witnesses,\npeople like Daniel potentially.\n\n197\n00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:07.330\nLet's say hypothetically, if he needs\nthe bar to be an expert witness\n\n198\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.940\nwho can testify in a court of law,\nspeak knowledgeably and\n\n199\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.420\nspeak authoritatively about advance and\ninterpret information but\n\n200\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.960\nthere is some very significant hurdles\nthat you have to overcome to be an expert\n\n201\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.780\nin witness based on at least the federal\nrules of evidence in the United States,\n\n202\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.870\nyou have to have done this for a period of\ntime have a track record in other words.\n\n203\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:30.170\nYou have to show credentials that indicate\nthat you are gonna be knowledgeable in\n\n204\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.670\nyour field there is a whole list\nof things that we'll go through,\n\n205\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.390\nin an upcoming episode that\nexplain how this works and\n\n206\n00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.800\nyou're gonna have to\nmeet all those criterias.\n\n207\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.370\nIf Daniel meets those criteria,\nhe maybe considered an expert witness.\n\n208\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.140\nForensic investigation teams will often\nhave expert witness associated with them\n\n209\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.600\nthat can take the testimony or\nrather the evidence gathered and\n\n210\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.318\nconvert it into testimony and\npresent it in a court of law if required.\n\n211\n00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:56.011\nAnd this is part of what you\nneed,you need evidence managers.\n\n212\n00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.920\nThese are people who are going to be in\ncharge of the evidence once it's brought\n\n213\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.700\nin and they are going to\nmaintain a chain of custody.\n\n214\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.130\nWe talked about the evidence\ncustodian being the person on site.\n\n215\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.300\nThe evidence librarians,\n\n216\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.870\nsometimes they're referred to\na different way to refer to them.\n\n217\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.940\nThis is the person on site at the crime\nscene that's gonna gather the evidence,\n\n218\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.640\nand everybody is gonna, essentially,\nwork under to present the evidence and\n\n219\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.210\nmake sure that it's secured properly.\n\n220\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.300\nThey are gonna be responsible for\ntransporting the evidence as well.\n\n221\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.820\nBut the evidence manager may be a broader\ntitle that encompasses not just\n\n222\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.610\nthe custodian or the librarian\nfunction but the general function\n\n223\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.370\nthat deals with evidence in any form and\nany area under any circumstance.\n\n224\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.880\nSo it depends on how you define it.\n\n225\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.650\nThe evidence documentor,\nthe evidence investigator,\n\n226\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.270\nthe incident analyzer, incident responder.\n\n227\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.570\nThese are all roles that may exist.\n\n228\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.390\nAn evidence documentor is the forensic\ntechnician that picks the evidence up,\n\n229\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.595\nfinds it, takes a picture of it.\n\n230\n00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:49.855\nTags and bags it.\n\n231\n00:11:49.855 --> 00:11:54.265\nGives it to the custodian and\nwrites all the information on the front of\n\n232\n00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:57.035\nthe bag that says here is what it is,\nwhere I found it.\n\n233\n00:11:57.035 --> 00:11:57.565\nScenic ID.\n\n234\n00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:59.565\nThis is the day and time.\n\n235\n00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:00.945\nThese are my initials.\n\n236\n00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:02.972\nThis This is what it refers to.\n\n237\n00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.662\nAnd so\nthis is the things you have to have.\n\n238\n00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:08.042\nThe descent could describes what's\ngoing on with the piece of evidence.\n\n239\n00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.972\nIt can't just be coffee cup,right I'm sure\nyou drop it in the bag and there is five\n\n240\n00:12:11.972 --> 00:12:16.651\ncoffee cups you're aware that coffee Was\nand what the circumstances are around it.\n\n241\n00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:17.991\nYou ever have that happen sometimes?\n\n242\n00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:19.921\nNot that, but you know, randomly.\n\n243\n00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:23.041\nYou go to take laundry out of the dryer,\nyou have one sock left, and you're\n\n244\n00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:26.301\nstanding there wondering like, where did\nthis come from, what does it relate to?\n\n245\n00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:26.901\nI'm convinced.\n\n246\n00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:28.810\nMy wife is convinced actually.\n\n247\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.910\nAnd she's convinced me.\n\n248\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.510\nBut I'm convinced that there is\na hidden place in everybody's house\n\n249\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.790\nwhere lonely socks go.\n\n250\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.480\nAnd there's like a whole little colony of\nindividual lonely socks that live there.\n\n251\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.840\nBecause their partners,\ntheir mates Are living with you, but\n\n252\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.400\nthey've actually been\ntransported somewhere else.\n\n253\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.905\n&gt;&gt; It's a lonely socks singles bar.\n\n254\n00:12:45.905 --> 00:12:46.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lonely socks singles,\n\n255\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.010\nthere you go exactly.\n\n256\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.090\nSo they're always hanging out\ntrying to find their match.\n\n257\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.910\nBecause you always wound\nup having like one sock.\n\n258\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.450\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; And you never seem to be able to\n\n259\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.310\nfind the match for it.\n\n260\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.210\nIt's like the dryer gets hungry and\nsays you know,\n\n261\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.130\nthe only thing I want is\nI feel like one sock.\n\n262\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I could just have one sock,\n\n263\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.740\nI would be satisfied.\n\n264\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.100\nAnd then you know, you get the other sock\nand you never know what to do with it.\n\n265\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.160\nSo we have our little bin\nof like orphaned socks.\n\n266\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.750\n&gt;&gt; One sock, yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.670\n&gt;&gt; One sock, right?\n\n268\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.490\nSo you need like a cleaning rag or\nsomething You go to the bin of lost socks.\n\n269\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.950\nIt's like lost souls, but they're socks.\n\n270\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.590\nThey're sock souls, or soul socks, right.\n\n271\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.470\nAnyway, so I'll have to wear my soul socks\nsome day, I'll have to bring those in.\n\n272\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.640\nSo we have evidence documenters,\nwe have incident analyzers,\n\n273\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640\nincident responders, right.\n\n274\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.270\nThese are the people that are going\nto the incident responders or\n\n275\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.290\nsimply the first responder.\n\n276\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.710\nThose are the people that are going to\nshow up and figure out what's happened.\n\n277\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.320\nThe incident analyzer.\n\n278\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.540\nThis may be the same person,\nthe responder.\n\n279\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.250\nBut it could also be a separate entity.\n\n280\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.580\nA separate person that is going to\nhelp us to understand the parameters.\n\n281\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.510\nA lot of times.\n\n282\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.110\nYou'll show up in a crime scene.\n\n283\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.020\nYou'll do an investigation and there's\nalready a group of people that have\n\n284\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.300\nbeen there there's law\nenforcement show up.\n\n285\n00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.330\nThere may be people from the company,\n\n286\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.510\nan internal security team\nan IT team whatever it is.\n\n287\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.360\nThey've responded but\n\n288\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.130\nyou may then bring in an expert,\nsomebody who can look at the room and or\n\n289\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.840\nlook at the system and say look this\nis what we think probably has gone on.\n\n290\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.180\nAnd that's typically what\nthe analyzer role may be.\n\n291\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.160\nThere's decision-makers,\nthere's a photographer typically,\n\n292\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.670\nsomebody who's gonna be taking pictures\ncuz you have to document everything.\n\n293\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.180\nVideo, pictures,\na variety of different ways of doing this.\n\n294\n00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.370\nBut the reality is, if we find any\npiece of evidence anywhere, and\n\n295\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.810\nwe don't document how we found it, the\ncontext around it, what it looked like.\n\n296\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.300\nCables are a good examples.\n\n297\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.610\nYeah the reality is we have to\nunderstand where everything is before we\n\n298\n00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.440\ntouch anything.\n\n299\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.910\nCan we do the overhead shot for\na just a second and focusing right.\n\n300\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.810\nCan you pan over to my machine\na little bit with the overhead shot?\n\n301\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.854\nI know we're doing this kind of live so\nbare with us here.\n\n302\n00:14:37.854 --> 00:14:42.351\nRight, to the far side of my machine over\ntowards the far wall no the other way,\n\n303\n00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:46.663\nthe other way, other way, other way,\nother way, other way, other way.\n\n304\n00:14:46.663 --> 00:14:48.246\nOkay.\n\n305\n00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:49.593\nAnd can you?\n\n306\n00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:50.630\nActually that's Daniel's machine.\n\n307\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.530\n&gt;&gt; That's my machine.\n\n308\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm totally screwed up.\n\n309\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes I'm sorry.\n\n310\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.280\nThe way you were going was the right way.\n\n311\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.110\nI apologize.\n\n312\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.980\nYeah we want to show that mess of cables,\nexactly.\n\n313\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.074\n&gt;&gt; Adam has camera dyslexia.\n\n314\n00:14:58.074 --> 00:15:00.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know if I hung upside down and\n\n315\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.710\nturned around I probably would see it.\n\n316\n00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.400\nI was trying to go for these but\nthat's okay, that will work, no big deal.\n\n317\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.400\nSo if you look over here\nwhat you can see ultimately.\n\n318\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.990\nRight?\n\n319\n00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.460\nIs you can see that we've got you\nknow a mouse sitting over here right?\n\n320\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.110\nAnd this mouse is connected to\nthis cable sitting over here.\n\n321\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.230\nIf I was to forensically examine this\ncrime scene hypothetically right?\n\n322\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.040\nAnd I was to say okay.\n\n323\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.560\nSo roughly before I touch anything,\nhow is everything set up right?\n\n324\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.050\nWhile there is a power plug in\nthe back of the computer right here,\n\n325\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.330\nthere's a mouse right sitting on\nthe right side of the keyboard, and\n\n326\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.810\nits plugged in to the USB port over here.\n\n327\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.660\nAnd so what we need to do is we\nneed to have a picture of that.\n\n328\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.020\nWe have to understand that.\n\n329\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.250\nAnd so this picture that we're\nlooking at right now would be perfect.\n\n330\n00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.350\nIf we froze that, essentially we just\ntook a freeze frame snapshot of that,\n\n331\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.258\nwe could use that forensically to Show\nthe context and the evidence, and\n\n332\n00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:50.649\nby the way also the stuff around it,\nright?\n\n333\n00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:53.939\nBecause we've got the other\ncomputer sitting over there, and\n\n334\n00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:57.537\nsome of the stuff, and we'd be able\nto see exactly what's going on,\n\n335\n00:15:57.537 --> 00:15:59.601\nthe pieces of paper on my arm rest here.\n\n336\n00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.128\nRight, we'd be able to understand that.\n\n337\n00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.844\nAnd then we could begin to\ntake things apart, right.\n\n338\n00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:06.761\nBecause then we could say, okay now\nwe know exactly what's gone on and\n\n339\n00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:08.580\nkind of the way it's set up, right.\n\n340\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.270\nIt's gonna be very important to\nhave that and to understand that.\n\n341\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.630\nBecause without that, if we start taking\nstuff apart and just saying okay,\n\n342\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.790\nyeah let me grab all that.\n\n343\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.000\nThen what's gonna happen is how do we know\nnumber one, how to put it back together,\n\n344\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.950\nand number two, what state it was in.\n\n345\n00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.870\nDo we know the mouse was definitely on\nthe left hand side of the keyboard?\n\n346\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.300\nAnd was it plugged into the first\nUSB port when we're testifying?\n\n347\n00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.400\nOr was it on the right hand side?\n\n348\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.130\n&gt;&gt; Right because if you can't prove\nthat that was the original state\n\n349\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.430\nas when you found it then\nyou got to throw that out.\n\n350\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.510\nYou got to throw out that testimony.\n\n351\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.160\nYou can't definitively say,\nyes this mouse was on the right hand side.\n\n352\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.170\nWell, the picture shows\nit was on the left, but\n\n353\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.910\nif there is no picture,\nwho could prove what?\n\n354\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.040\nIt's just somebody's word\nversus another person´s word.\n\n355\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.920\n&gt;&gt; And we can cast doubt, cuz a good\ndefense attorney is gonna turn that little\n\n356\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.570\ndetail into doubt in the mind of the\npeople involved in the trial, the jury.\n\n357\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.920\nHe's gonna say, well you know Adam,\nyour an expert witness and that's great,\n\n358\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.820\nbut if you're not sure\nabout where the mouse was,\n\n359\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.010\nhow do we know that anything else\nyou're gonna tell us is accurate.\n\n360\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.400\nI mean, you know,\nmaybe you're just having a bad day, right?\n\n361\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.540\nWe're not sure, but\nwe know you're not definitively able to\n\n362\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.330\nauthoritatively tell us that the mouse\nwas there, and that casts doubt on all\n\n363\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.880\nthe other stuff that you're\nattempting to tell us about, right?\n\n364\n00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.940\nSo that's gonna be important.\n\n365\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.630\nSo we gotta really understand that\nthe photographer may be one of the most\n\n366\n00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.710\nimportant roles, quite honestly,\nthat we have on this team.\n\n367\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.330\nBecause without capturing context and\n\n368\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.660\nstate we really don't have a way\nof reproducing the evidence.\n\n369\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.500\nAnd more often than not\nwhat we find today,\n\n370\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.950\nis you often see in the crime dramas\nthey're walking around with still cameras\n\n371\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.390\nright they're taking\npictures of everything.\n\n372\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.080\nAnd that's fine but you often find today\nas well that a lot of video work is done.\n\n373\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.550\nThey'll come in and\nvideo tape an entire scene,\n\n374\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.830\nbefore anything is removed,\nthey'll get still closeups of everything.\n\n375\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.350\nYou know a lot of time you'll see\nthe little ruler, they have the black and\n\n376\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.500\nwhite ruler, they'll put down, to give\nyou the sense of depth and context, so\n\n377\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.480\nit's two inches, little shell casing or\nsomething, right?\n\n378\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.140\nAnd then, you know, they'll do everything.\n\n379\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.800\nThis way, if there's any question about,\n\n380\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.150\nhey, what was all\nthe other stuff around it?\n\n381\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.260\nWe can reproduce that entire scene and\na lot of times and you'll see that this\n\n382\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.590\nstuff gets translated into a computer\nsimulation that they build,\n\n383\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.780\nlike a simulated environment where they\nhave the room and everything and it's all\n\n384\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.680\nlaid out and you can now interact with all\nthat evidence in the virtual environment.\n\n385\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.360\nAnd this is a lot of times how\nwe reproduce the crime scene and\n\n386\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.050\nalso how testimony is now being done\nbecause you can now walk through\n\n387\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.390\nthe crime scene showing\npeople in the court and\n\n388\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.800\nthings like that,\nwhat went on and how it happened.\n\n389\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.080\nThis is not in every case obviously.\n\n390\n00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.070\nIt takes a lot of time,\nresources, and money.\n\n391\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.060\nAnd this is only done in\nspecial circumstances.\n\n392\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.200\nBut it's often done to\nreconstruct certain activities.\n\n393\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.900\nSo we can tell where somebody came in, the\nsteps they took, what they may have done.\n\n394\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.952\nIn shootings a lot of times this will\nbe done to reconstruct where a shooter\n\n395\n00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:39.820\nmay have been.\n\n396\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.130\nSo we could see the angle\nfrom where they shot.\n\n397\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:47.040\nIn a car accident a lot of times if it\ninvolves very bad injuries or death.\n\n398\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.170\nYou'll reproduce that, kinda show\nan animation of the cars traveling and\n\n399\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.410\nhow they crashed and\nwhat the circumstances were.\n\n400\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.210\nSo, this kind of stuff, all this\nis done by forensic investigators.\n\n401\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.350\nIt's just a matter of\nwhat you specialize in.\n\n402\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.060\nAnd, a lot of times these reconstruction\nactivities are very helpful to figure out\n\n403\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.910\nhow these things occur.\n\n404\n00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.197\nOr, you could just sit down with paper and\npencil and crayons,\n\n405\n00:19:06.197 --> 00:19:07.485\nand you could draw stick figures.\n\n406\n00:19:07.485 --> 00:19:08.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n407\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.500\nthis is me, this is the bad actor,\nnotice the unhappy, frowny face right, and\n\n408\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.415\nyou know,\nthat's the old way of doing things.\n\n409\n00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:17.520\n[LAUGH] All right so, forensics law.\n\n410\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.890\nLet's talk a bit about forensics laws.\n\n411\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.610\nSo we talked about the idea of building\nup this team, and we've also talked about\n\n412\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.920\nthe awareness of the rules of\nengagement that we have to follow with.\n\n413\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.830\nCan we go to my machine,\n\n414\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.005\nI wanna show you how were gonna\nactually take a look at some\n\n415\n00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:34.530\nforensics laws specifically where you're\ngonna go to find some forensics laws.\n\n416\n00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.290\nAnd so the Federal Rules of Evidence,\nare gonna be again,\n\n417\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.820\nUnited States centric here are gonna\nbe important for us to be aware of.\n\n418\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.180\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence,\nthe FRE as they are referred to.\n\n419\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.463\nThese are going to be the rulebook that\nwe have to follow if we're gonna present\n\n420\n00:19:50.463 --> 00:19:52.630\nevidence to a court of law\nin the United States or\n\n421\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.130\nany jurisdiction that the United States\nis going to be involved with.\n\n422\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.250\nSo, for instance, in Puerto Rico or\nthe US Virgin Islands,\n\n423\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.540\nyou're bound by the Federal Rules of\nEvidence because they're territories or\n\n424\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.520\nareas that the United States has control\nover or holds sway over legally.\n\n425\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.020\nBut in France, in the EU, in Israel,\n\n426\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.850\nin South Africa, there are different\nrules of evidence, right.\n\n427\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.810\nAnd we have to follow\nwhatever those may be.\n\n428\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.531\nThey may be aligned with\nthe US Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n429\n00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:22.210\nthey may be built around them but the\nreality is there are subtle differences.\n\n430\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.242\nYou know, a court is a court,\na case is a case, a crime is a crime but\n\n431\n00:20:26.242 --> 00:20:31.007\nthe subtlety indistinctions of those\nare unique to each individual country.\n\n432\n00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:34.297\nAnd we must be respectful of them,\nmust be knowledgeable of them and\n\n433\n00:20:34.297 --> 00:20:37.850\nmust understand how to interact\nwith them in order to do our job.\n\n434\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.560\nSo it's important for\n\n435\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.128\nyou to know where to go to find this\ninformation as an investigator.\n\n436\n00:20:42.128 --> 00:20:47.510\nThis website, therulesofevidence.org,\nagain Daniel will have all these URLs for\n\n437\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.750\nyou up in the show notes, make sure you\nguys know how to interact with them.\n\n438\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.410\nThis is going to allow\nus to take a look at\n\n439\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.580\nthe current 2016 edition of\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n440\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.890\nThe reason I like this site is,\nit gives us access to the material online,\n\n441\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.850\nso you can see that we can go down, we\n\n442\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.250\nhave 11 articles overall that the Federal\nRules of Evidence are broken down into.\n\n443\n00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.530\nThey're listed over here on the left.\n\n444\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.690\nCould we go full screen for a minute?\n\n445\n00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.590\nJust so we can see.\n\n446\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.190\nThat's a little bit easier to see,\nthank you.\n\n447\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.480\nSo you can see we have general provisions,\njudicial notice, presumptions and\n\n448\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.610\ncivil actions and proceedings,\nrelevancy and limits, privileges,\n\n449\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.540\nwitnesses, opinions and expert testimony,\nthat's where we find out what the rules\n\n450\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.530\nare to become an expert witness and\nhow to deal with that.\n\n451\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.420\nYou'll see we have hearsay, right?\n\n452\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.560\nYou'll see that we have authentication and\nidentification.\n\n453\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.630\nContent of writing,\nrecording and photographs.\n\n454\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.870\nThis is where we deal with\nhow evidence is presented and\n\n455\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.330\nwhat the requirements are for them,\nand then miscellaneous rules.\n\n456\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.320\nFull screen.\n\n457\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.820\nMiscellaneous rules,\nwe can see that as well.\n\n458\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.200\nWe also on the right have table of\ncontents, and it breaks it down and\n\n459\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.080\nyou can see they're listed as articles.\n\n460\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.510\nAnd you know they're referenced, and\nyou can click through any one of them.\n\n461\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.953\nSo if we go to, for instance,\nOpinions and Expert Testimony.\n\n462\n00:21:57.953 --> 00:22:01.611\nAnd we just click on that one,\nit takes us into Article VII, and\n\n463\n00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:06.253\nwe can see all the different rules\nnumbered, 701, 702, 703, etc.\n\n464\n00:22:06.253 --> 00:22:09.660\nEach rule has a number\nstarting in the article.\n\n465\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.630\nSo rule 7, rule 7 articles or\narticle 7 rules are gonna start with\n\n466\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.410\nthe number 7 and then they´re iterated,\n1, 2, 3, so opinion testimony by law.\n\n467\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.480\nby a lay witness.\n\n468\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.770\nTestimony by expert witness,\ncourt appointed expert witnesses.\n\n469\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.170\nEvery category is dealt with here.\n\n470\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.650\nAnd so we can kind of walk\nthrough them and see them.\n\n471\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.850\nSo it's important for you to have\na sense of where to find these, and\n\n472\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.760\nobviously having knowledge of\na site like this will be helpful.\n\n473\n00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.330\nThe nice thing is you can just go in and\n\n474\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.360\ndrill through the table of contents\nright from here as well, and\n\n475\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.050\nactually just walk through the entire book\nonline referencing the required areas.\n\n476\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.999\nWe also have the US government,\nFederal Digital System,\n\n477\n00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:51.544\nFDCsys, the GPO, govinfo site,\nwhere you can go and\n\n478\n00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:56.605\nsearch more broadly for\nany US federal law or requirement.\n\n479\n00:22:56.605 --> 00:23:02.486\nNot just the Federal Rules of Evidence but\nfor instance you may go in and\n\n480\n00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:07.479\nwanna search for\nsomething like this, 18 usc 1029.\n\n481\n00:23:12.115 --> 00:23:14.940\nAnd we'll give it just\na second to do its thing.\n\n482\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.380\nAnd what you'll find is\nthat we're able to go in,\n\n483\n00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.080\nand we're able to pull up information\nrelating to a variety of things.\n\n484\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.250\nYou know, and it may be information\nabout the standard associated with this.\n\n485\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.220\nIt may reference a court case\nthat leads to understanding.\n\n486\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.080\nIt gives us a whole bout of different\nthings in the federal jurisdictional\n\n487\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.260\nsystem, but\nwe can see a lot of information.\n\n488\n00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:45.590\nNow the citation I used, 18 USC 1029,\nis actually a standard for\n\n489\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.700\nfraud and related activities in\nconnection with access devices.\n\n490\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.680\nSo, essentially in connection\nwith digital information.\n\n491\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.751\nNow, we're able to search for\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n492\n00:23:54.751 --> 00:23:58.614\nLooking for, either opinions\nfrom the court or looking for\n\n493\n00:23:58.614 --> 00:24:02.562\nthe United States laws that may\nbe appropriate in this case.\n\n494\n00:24:02.562 --> 00:24:06.135\nAnd there's a list of standards, and\nrules that we need to be aware of, and\n\n495\n00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:08.340\nsites like this will help us to find them.\n\n496\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.190\nWanna run through a few of them with you.\n\n497\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.010\nWe're gonna put a relatively complete and\nauthoritative list in terms of ones that\n\n498\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.035\nwould probably be beneficial for\nyou to have knowledge of.\n\n499\n00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:19.555\nIn the show notes,\nDaniel's gonna provide that to you guys,\n\n500\n00:24:19.555 --> 00:24:21.105\nI'm not gonna hit every one of them.\n\n501\n00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:21.902\nIt's a very long list.\n\n502\n00:24:21.902 --> 00:24:24.825\n[LAUGH] I'm just gonna hit a few\nof them off the top of my head\n\n503\n00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:25.785\nthat you guys can look for.\n\n504\n00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:27.445\nKinda like the highlight reel, exactly.\n\n505\n00:24:27.445 --> 00:24:28.670\nSo I'm just gonna throw a couple up.\n\n506\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.910\nWhat we'll do is I'll actually just\nput a few up in Notepad real quick,\n\n507\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.480\njust type them out for you,\nthat we have a sense of them.\n\n508\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.440\nWe just put the caps lock up,\nso you have 18 USC 1029,\n\n509\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.020\nthat's the one I just mentioned.\n\n510\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.450\nThat's the fraud or related activity\nin connection with access devices.\n\n511\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:51.230\nYou've got USC 1030, so basically\nthe same idea, just one iterated,\n\n512\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.950\nyou know I keep doing that because,\nit's what you get for\n\n513\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:01.130\nusing a Apple computer when you are used\nto using a non Apple computer right.\n\n514\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:06.510\n18 USC 103 who puts the function key where\nthe control key normally is on a keyboard.\n\n515\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.620\nI don't pretend to know what\ngoes on over the Apple player.\n\n516\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Apparently the Apple people do right?\n\n517\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.330\nBecause I keep going to hit\nthe control key thing and\n\n518\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.780\nthat's where it's gonna be in a keyboard\nFunction key because that's where it is.\n\n519\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.070\nSo anyway 18 USC 1030 fraud or related\nactivity in connection with computers.\n\n520\n00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.090\nThese two laws go together,\n\n521\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.850\nthey help us to understand what\nthe definition of fraud may be, and\n\n522\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:30.410\nas a result how we then operate to figure\nout and suspect that it may have occurred.\n\n523\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.150\nWe have rule 402,\nrelevent evidence generally admissible,\n\n524\n00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.340\nirrelevant evidence that\nmay be inadmissible.\n\n525\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.440\nSo, rule 402 is gonna be one of\nthe federal rules of evidence.\n\n526\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.490\nRule 901 requirements for\nauthentication or identification.\n\n527\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.310\nRule 608, evidence of character and\nconduct of a witness.\n\n528\n00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.270\nThere is all these rules that we are gonna\neither have to have knowledge of or\n\n529\n00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.140\nessentially know where to find.\n\n530\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.650\nRemember nobody expects you to read every\nrule and be able to recite it verbatim.\n\n531\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.420\nI mean we do expect you to\nbe knowledgeable about them\n\n532\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.320\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n533\n00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.690\nBut you do what most people do.\n\n534\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.910\nYou go and look them up when\nyou have a need to use them.\n\n535\n00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.705\nShowing you the sites.\n\n536\n00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:07.005\nWhich, where you can go to do that is\nreally what becomes so important for\n\n537\n00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:09.515\nyou, as opposed to saying, Hey!\n\n538\n00:26:09.515 --> 00:26:10.875\nRule 702.\nAnd you're standing there going, Yeah,\n\n539\n00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:13.575\nthat's about a lay witness\nbeing able to testify.\n\n540\n00:26:13.575 --> 00:26:16.825\nThat's actually 701, not 702,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n541\n00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:20.070\nBut I know that because I have to look\nat those rules on a regular basis.\n\n542\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.750\nYou probably don't know that.\n\n543\n00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.480\nAnd as a result, you'd have to go\nlook it up at some of the sites that\n\n544\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.940\nwe were taking you to and\nshowing you how to interact.\n\n545\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.350\nJust be aware of that.\n\n546\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.900\nAlso, the need to seek\nauthorization before we act.\n\n547\n00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.380\nThis is so critical, right?\n\n548\n00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.560\nWe never go in Never investigate\nany activity of any kind\n\n549\n00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.080\nunless a manager,\na decision maker or stakeholder.\n\n550\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.620\nWe use different terms for\nthem, whatever they may be, but\n\n551\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.900\nsomebody in a position of authority that's\ngonna be able to {INAUDIBLE] say to us\n\n552\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.520\nyes you have permission to come in and\ndo this on behalf of the business and\n\n553\n00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.370\nis given us rights to do that,\nhas said it's okay.\n\n554\n00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:56.340\nSo you have to get permission.\n\n555\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.760\nAll right, this is very important.\n\n556\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.900\nWe can't just decide to show up and start\ninvestigating somebody unless we have\n\n557\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.760\nevidence that proves that there may be\nmalfeasance, there may be bad activity and\n\n558\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.420\nwe can prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat we have justifiable cause, and\n\n559\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.370\nas a result we could seek permission.\n\n560\n00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.600\nNow permission may be hey Daniel,\nyou're in charge.\n\n561\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.530\nAs the manager, do you give me\nthe right to go look in that room?\n\n562\n00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.670\nAnd Daniel may say yeah,\nabsolutely Adam, go ahead.\n\n563\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:24.460\nAnd that would be acceptable in a court of\nlaw, because Daniel's the authoritative\n\n564\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.050\nfigure who is in charge on site and\nhas given me permission to do a search.\n\n565\n00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Adam, is verbal permission admissible?\n\n566\n00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.450\nIs that good enough,\nas far as the evidence goes?\n\n567\n00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.280\nSo, I had authority to act.\n\n568\n00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.178\nOr would you need that\nin some sort of writing?\n\n569\n00:27:37.178 --> 00:27:38.880\n&gt;&gt; So right.\nSo exactly where I'm going with this.\n\n570\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.060\nSo there's distinctions, right?\n\n571\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.060\nSo if Daniel says to me as the manager of\nthe location, I'm giving you authority\n\n572\n00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.530\nto do the search and verbally gives that\nto me, I may go back and get that in\n\n573\n00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.650\nwriting just to cover myself, so we don't\nhave a he said, she said activity later.\n\n574\n00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.050\nBut that's all I need, I need Daniel's\nverbal permission to conduct a search.\n\n575\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.330\nNow as a law enforcement official we\ntalked about this in some prior shows.\n\n576\n00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.080\nThere is a different standard\nin as a private citizen.\n\n577\n00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.710\nI have to now get in to a warrant\nversus warrantless search scenario,\n\n578\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.110\nwhere as a law enforcement official.\n\n579\n00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.915\n&gt;&gt; Can we do gang sign?\n\n580\n00:28:13.915 --> 00:28:15.770\n&gt;&gt; {INAUDIBLE] can we do like you know.\n\n581\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.925\nI'm giving Adam the two minute warning.\n\n582\n00:28:18.925 --> 00:28:19.650\n[LAUGH] He's like.\n\n583\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.660\n&gt;&gt; It's more like one of these, like\nstop talking and get ready to finish up.\n\n584\n00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wrap up buddy.\n\n585\n00:28:24.603 --> 00:28:26.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna now purposely ignore\n\n586\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.770\nthat, and I'm gonna just keep\ndoing what I'm here to do.\n\n587\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.110\nSo, rest assured there will be\nplenty of additional time for\n\n588\n00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.400\nme to talk, cuz we're not gonna\nstop in a minute and a half.\n\n589\n00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.370\n&gt;&gt; But I follow my methodology.\n\n590\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, you did what you were supposed\nto do, and as a result you're covered.\n\n591\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.950\n&gt;&gt; That's all that matters, right?\n\n592\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n593\n00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.280\nGetting back to what\nwere here to talk about.\n\n594\n00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Seems irrelevant to the show.\n\n595\n00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.874\n&gt;&gt; It is and we wasted the minute and\na half that we had doing this.\n\n596\n00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:47.198\n[CROSSTALK] Two more minutes now,\n\n597\n00:28:47.198 --> 00:28:50.233\nwere actually trying to figure out how\nto wrap up and say what I wanted to say.\n\n598\n00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:53.940\nSo, I'm getting back to what\nwas important and relevant.\n\n599\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.950\nSo we get into this\nsituation in regards to\n\n600\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.180\nwarrantless versus warrant based searches\nwhere, as a law enforcement official.\n\n601\n00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.560\nI may actually need to go seek\na warrant in order to have Daniel\n\n602\n00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:10.000\nprovide me access because Daniel is giving\nme the right to search may not be enough\n\n603\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.180\nif I'm a law enforcement official but\nit may be, it depends on the circumstance.\n\n604\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.890\nSo, for instance,\nif I am somebody who is a minor.\n\n605\n00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.450\nI live in let's say, my parent's house.\n\n606\n00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.320\nThe parent or\nthe guardian can give law enforcement\n\n607\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.340\nofficials the right to search\nmy stuff without my permission,\n\n608\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.270\nI don't even need to be there because\nI'm essentially under their care.\n\n609\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.725\nIf I'm a major, over 18 years old,\nleaving at home, right.\n\n610\n00:29:34.725 --> 00:29:38.155\nAnd the person who owns\nthe home is still able to give\n\n611\n00:29:38.155 --> 00:29:41.985\nlaw enforcement officials the right to\nsearch, because I'm resident in that home.\n\n612\n00:29:41.985 --> 00:29:44.605\nAnd depending on\nthe expectation of privacy,\n\n613\n00:29:44.605 --> 00:29:46.512\nthey may be able to do that\nwithout my permission.\n\n614\n00:29:46.512 --> 00:29:49.602\nSo, there's all these subtleties right,\nthat we would have to be aware of.\n\n615\n00:29:49.602 --> 00:29:53.202\nBut when i'm an investigator not\na law enforcement official, But\n\n616\n00:29:53.202 --> 00:29:56.472\na private citizen working\noutside of law enforcement duty,\n\n617\n00:29:56.472 --> 00:29:58.672\nforensic investigative work,\nthe rules are different.\n\n618\n00:29:58.672 --> 00:29:59.782\nI don't need to get a warrant,\n\n619\n00:29:59.782 --> 00:30:01.542\nas a matter of fact i have\nno way of getting a warrant.\n\n620\n00:30:01.542 --> 00:30:04.112\nWarrants are not available\nto private citizens,\n\n621\n00:30:04.112 --> 00:30:06.770\nthey are a mechanism that is\navailable to law enforcement.\n\n622\n00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.910\nAnd as a result, I can rely on somebody\nlike Daniel being in the position of\n\n623\n00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.550\nauthority, negotiating with me and\nsaying to me, okay.\n\n624\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.390\nYes, as the manager here, I'm giving you\nthe right to come in and to do that, but\n\n625\n00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.090\nthe thing is as I mentioned I will\nnot just take Daniel's word for it.\n\n626\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.755\nHis verbal permission be enough because\nI'm not a law enforcement official\n\n627\n00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:29.290\n,because I'm not in a position to be able\nto testify authoritatively to what Daniel\n\n628\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.050\nsaid because I'm the one\nexecuting the activit.\n\n629\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.150\nAnd that gives me justifiable reason and\ncause in the eyes of the court\n\n630\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.510\nto potentially say, yeah, Daniel said it,\neven though he may not have.\n\n631\n00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.670\nIn other words there's a little he said,\nshe said,\n\n632\n00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.910\nlike I said,\nthat potentially can go on there.\n\n633\n00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.860\nOr in Daniel and I's case,\nhe said, he said.\n\n634\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.190\nRight?\nAnd so as a result, what I would do is,\n\n635\n00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.310\nI would go back to Daniel and say,\n\n636\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.640\nHey Daniel, I understand you're\ngiving the right to do this.\n\n637\n00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.210\nAppreciate you cooperating.\n\n638\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.610\nCan we just write this up on\na piece of paper real quick?\n\n639\n00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.590\nSign it for me and say, hey by the way.\n\n640\n00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.950\nOn this day and time,\nI had a conversation with this person, and\n\n641\n00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.270\nin this position,\nI gave them the authority to do this.\n\n642\n00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.505\nAnd if Daniel signs that and we have that,\n\n643\n00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:09.930\nyou essentially agreed upon then I\ncan present that later and say but\n\n644\n00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.630\nDaniel, when I showed up you said\nto me hey, Adam who are you?\n\n645\n00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.790\nWe had this conversation.\n\n646\n00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.480\nWe agreed you would let me do this.\n\n647\n00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.170\nYou identified yourself as\nthe manager of the property,\n\n648\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.330\nsomebody who was in a position or\n\n649\n00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.920\nauthority to give me the right to\nsearch and you and I agreed on that and\n\n650\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.950\nwe signs piece of papers stipulating that\nI can search that room but nothing else.\n\n651\n00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.137\nYou agreed to that, right?\n\n652\n00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:31.580\nWe'd then have to say yeah,\nYou know I did, write?\n\n653\n00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.720\nWe have some writing so\nI did give you the right to do that.\n\n654\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.790\nAs on the court, that would be sufficient.\n\n655\n00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.560\nWe could say now,\nyeah whether we found anything value or\n\n656\n00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.380\nnot at least we did so legally.\n\n657\n00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.843\nWe didn't break law and Daniel is\nan authorize representative of that\n\n658\n00:31:44.843 --> 00:31:47.553\nenvironment, was able to give\nme the right to do that.\n\n659\n00:31:47.553 --> 00:31:51.743\nSo, this becomes very important thought\nprocess with regards to how we're gonna\n\n660\n00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:52.604\nbuild our team.\n\n661\n00:31:52.604 --> 00:31:55.192\nPrerequisite knowledge,\nawareness of the laws,\n\n662\n00:31:55.192 --> 00:31:58.081\nfederal rules of evidence,\nUnited States civil code and\n\n663\n00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:01.225\nall things we have to be aware\nof in order to operate properly.\n\n664\n00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:04.112\nThese are all parts of\nthe knowledge based, right, and\n\n665\n00:32:04.112 --> 00:32:08.354\nthe pre-requisite knowledge and skills\nthat the investigator needs to build and\n\n666\n00:32:08.354 --> 00:32:11.980\nbring to the table in order to do\nour job effectively as a CHFI.\n\n667\n00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.090\n&gt;&gt; It's really interesting how you\nreally have to have a mindset when okay,\n\n668\n00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.290\nwe are now inside of an investigation.\n\n669\n00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.534\nI have to start thinking and\ndoing things differently\n\n670\n00:32:21.534 --> 00:32:25.292\nthat are in line with the fact\nthat we are in an investigation.\n\n671\n00:32:25.292 --> 00:32:29.094\nDoing things like getting a written\npermission to search something.\n\n672\n00:32:29.094 --> 00:32:30.985\nIf you’re part of a law\nenforcement agency,\n\n673\n00:32:30.985 --> 00:32:34.440\nget the warrants that are necessary so\nthat everything is admissible.\n\n674\n00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.560\nIt is not just, I’ll just start snatching\nstuff up and taking it in a minute and\n\n675\n00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.542\nwe’re good to go.\n\n676\n00:32:39.542 --> 00:32:42.638\nLot of procedure to follow, lot of\nthings that you need to be aware of,\n\n677\n00:32:42.638 --> 00:32:45.262\nlaws that are in place,\nthat if you're not familiar with,\n\n678\n00:32:45.262 --> 00:32:47.800\nyou can find yourself in a bind\nbecause of that very fact.\n\n679\n00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.920\nAnd Adam you've done a great job\nof reminding us of that very fact.\n\n680\n00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.210\nAnything else you want to add?\n\n681\n00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.800\n&gt;&gt; And so remember yes, this is one\nof the things Dan made a great point.\n\n682\n00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.372\nI remind you about this all\nthe time we're together,\n\n683\n00:32:59.372 --> 00:33:02.460\nbut especially with regards\nto this conversation.\n\n684\n00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.030\nWe've talked about this in respect\nof the United States laws right,\n\n685\n00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.910\nthe federal rules of evidence,\nthe United States civil code, etc.\n\n686\n00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:13.070\nEvery country as I keep specifying and\nstipulating,\n\n687\n00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.730\nwill have slight variations or major\ndeviations from what that looks like.\n\n688\n00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.570\nYou know as I said, a crime is a crime,\ncourt is a court, and\n\n689\n00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.540\nevidence is evidence, but\n\n690\n00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.200\nhow you define that around the world\nbased on jurisdiction, varies greatly.\n\n691\n00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.950\nAnd as an investigator,\nit's your responsibility and\n\n692\n00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.760\nit's the most important responsibility\nyou have to be aware of the jurisdiction,\n\n693\n00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.440\nthe requirements,\nthe laws that you operate under, and\n\n694\n00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.240\nto adhere to those whatever they are,\nas Daniel was suggesting.\n\n695\n00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.290\nWhether it's just hey you got\nverbal authorization from me,\n\n696\n00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.060\nyou wrote it down show up\nwith a piece of paper.\n\n697\n00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.530\nThe court takes that as being okay, or\n\n698\n00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.220\nthe court says that hey, I don't care\nwhat you and Dan agreed to, guess what,\n\n699\n00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.800\nthere's no such thing as Daniel having\nthe right to tell you what you can search.\n\n700\n00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.000\nThe only people to get to search stuff\nin this country are people with badges\n\n701\n00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.510\nand guns.\n\n702\n00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.505\nDo you have those?\n\n703\n00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:01.085\nYou don't?\nGreat!\n\n704\n00:34:01.085 --> 00:34:03.735\nGuess what, whatever you found,\nwe don't wanna hear about it right.\n\n705\n00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:04.835\nI'm not saying that would happen.\n\n706\n00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:07.815\nI'm just pointing out\nthat if as investigator,\n\n707\n00:34:07.815 --> 00:34:12.265\nwe're not aware of what those rules are,\nwe've already lost the battle.\n\n708\n00:34:12.265 --> 00:34:16.767\nWe've already essentially, messed it up,\nright, before we actually even started\n\n709\n00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:20.177\nbecause we're not gonna do it the right\nway, it being an investigation.\n\n710\n00:34:20.177 --> 00:34:23.447\nAnd as a result, anything we find,\nit's not gonna be presentable on the court\n\n711\n00:34:23.447 --> 00:34:26.020\nof law and\nthat unfortunately at the end of the day,\n\n712\n00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:31.670\nwould ruin any chance that the victim\nmay have of seeking getting justice,\n\n713\n00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.810\nwhatever the case maybe,\nwe've garbaged it up, so to speak.\n\n714\n00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.102\nSo it's very important for\nus to remember that.\n\n715\n00:34:36.102 --> 00:34:37.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIt's their ball field,\n\n716\n00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.970\nthey get to choose the rules.\n\n717\n00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:42.170\nThat being said, Allan, than you so\nmuch for dropping by today.\n\n718\n00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.416\nWe thank you guys for watching, but\nit is time for us to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n719\n00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.905\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n720\n00:34:46.905 --> 00:34:49.742\n&gt;&gt; I am Daniel Lowrie's other host.\n\n721\n00:34:49.742 --> 00:34:53.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n722\n00:34:53.238 --> 00:34:59.263\n[MUSIC]\n\n723\n00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:02.096\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; That was\nit right there, part three.\n\n21\n00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:54.130\nAlright, let's get to part three, and then\nwe'll get to part four when we're done.\n\n22\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.790\nSo we left off talking, in our last\ndiscussion, about the methodology,\n\n23\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.020\nthe mechanism, awareness of requirements,\njurisdiction, laws, all the things that,\n\n24\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.280\nas the investigator,\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n25\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750\nWe should probably pick up with something\nthat's an incredibly important theme.\n\n26\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.690\nDaniel and I were chatting about it\nbefore we got online here a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.460\nThe idea of a assessing risk, right?\n\n28\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630\nAnd understanding what risk is and\nhow important risk is to what we do.\n\n29\n00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:22.000\nWhat I want to do and if we, give me half\na second before we go to my machine,\n\n30\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.910\njust wanna set something up real quick.\n\n31\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.300\nBut again, while I'm doing this so\n\n32\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.490\nwe're not just looking at me look down\nat my machine while I'm talking to you.\n\n33\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.170\nSo play a game with me if you don't mind.\n\n34\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.710\nSo when I talk to you about risk, right.\n\n35\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.240\nAnd we think about risk, in general.\n\n36\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780\nAnd we think about it from\nthe security perspective, right.\n\n37\n00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.300\nSo what are some of the things that\nwe would want to consider when we\n\n38\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.420\nthink about risk?\n\n39\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.330\nFrom the perspective of hey,\nI'm a security professional,\n\n40\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.590\nI'm a practitioner, I'm somebody\nwho's engaged in these activities.\n\n41\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.940\nWhat are some of the things we\nwant to tell everybody would be\n\n42\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.790\nthinking in our minds that would\ncome to the top of our head?\n\n43\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.500\nWhile I just set up this demo I want\nto do real quick around risk, so\n\n44\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.490\nwalk me through some of\nthe thought process real quick.\n\n45\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.510\n&gt;&gt; All righty, first of all,\n\n46\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.230\nyou always wanna consider your\nphysical security, right?\n\n47\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.950\nIf someone can actually,\nWes likes to say this a lot.\n\n48\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.040\nIf I can touch your server,\nit's no longer your server,\n\n49\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.200\nbecause now I have full on access\nto it and I can do what I want.\n\n50\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.720\n&gt;&gt; Wes is kind of a touchy\nfeely kind of guy.\n\n51\n00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.130\nSee he likes that, I get that.\n\n52\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.630\nAlright, so got that.\n\n53\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.250\nSo can I get to you physically,\ncan I gain access.\n\n54\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.575\nWe talked about that as being proximity,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:22.920\nBut proximity control, border defenses,\nguards, guns and gates,\n\n56\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.010\nthings of that nature.\n\n57\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.825\nSo, definitely want to think about\nbeing able to create a stand off.\n\n58\n00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:30.285\nBarrier, or security zone between\nmyself and things that are going on.\n\n59\n00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.335\nWhat else may come up,\nwhat else would be important?\n\n60\n00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.765\n&gt;&gt; We definitely have to worry\nabout obviously the digital risk.\n\n61\n00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.765\nThe people being able to\naccess things digitally,\n\n62\n00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:42.297\ndo I have unsecure ports on a server,\nmaybe.\n\n63\n00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:43.827\nMaybe I'm not patching.\n\n64\n00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:47.155\nMaybe I'm not fighting off against\nviruses through anti-virus,\n\n65\n00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.257\nanti-malware type of software.\n\n66\n00:02:49.257 --> 00:02:52.707\nThese are definite ways that I\nhave actually seen, in real life,\n\n67\n00:02:52.707 --> 00:02:56.417\nwhere people have been compromised\nthrough that, so definitely a risk there.\n\n68\n00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:57.937\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely a risk, as well, right?\n\n69\n00:02:57.937 --> 00:03:01.297\nAssociated with the, as well,\nas physical the logical, right?\n\n70\n00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:04.140\nor the ability for\nus to be able to connect.\n\n71\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.050\nBut not just simply walk in and\ntake control, but\n\n72\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.850\nessentially over the wire right\ncome in from behind the scenes so\n\n73\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.510\nthese are definitely categories,\nthings we want to be aware of right?\n\n74\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.570\nAnd so when we think about risk we have\nto assess the risk and so what Daniel was\n\n75\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.440\nhelping me to walk through was the idea\nof thinking through the logic of risk and\n\n76\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.130\nthen coming up the way to document it.\n\n77\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.086\nWe're to take that one level deeper so\nif you could join me on my screen here.\n\n78\n00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.870\nWhat you're going to see is instead of\nquick Google search you can see a search\n\n79\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.770\nfor risk assessment matrices or\nrisk assessment matrix.\n\n80\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.610\nAnd the idea is that we actually have a\nform of methodology to assess risk, right?\n\n81\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.930\nAnd when we are thinking\nabout hey what kind of risk,\n\n82\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.950\nwhat's the likelihood,\nwhat's the probability, what's the impact?\n\n83\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.720\nHow much it's going to hurt us,\nhow likely is it to happen and\n\n84\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.070\nwhat do we do as a result.\n\n85\n00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.790\nWe come up with the way to begin to talk\nabout risk in frame the conversation, so\n\n86\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.900\nyou know when we look at\nthese different graphics.\n\n87\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.064\nWhere not going to really focus\non anyone in particular but\n\n88\n00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:57.180\njust hypothetically right?\n\n89\n00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.220\nAny of the one's that are.\n\n90\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.300\nOn the screen there as\nyou do a Google search.\n\n91\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.770\nYou'll see the same exact thing\nas we look at these images.\n\n92\n00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.498\nYou're going to see a pretty\ntraditional thought process, right.\n\n93\n00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:10.590\nWe're going to see essentially a way\nof documenting in an x,y axis a grid\n\n94\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.610\nhow we can look at risk Risk.\n\n95\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.320\nIf we look at something like the one\nthat's on the left hand side there,\n\n96\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.720\non this column right here,\nlike any of these would do just fine.\n\n97\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.210\nThey're all basically the same.\n\n98\n00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.740\nBut if we look at any of these, and\n\n99\n00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.060\nwe see that we have likelihood and\nwe have consequence.\n\n100\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.890\nSo likelihood is, hey, is it very likely,\nsomewhat likely, highly unlikely?\n\n101\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.500\nConsequence is, is it gonna hurt a little,\na lot, or somewhere in between?\n\n102\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.410\nI call it the three bears analogy, right?\n\n103\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.280\nToo soft, too hard, just right.\n\n104\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.060\nThen if we begin to build a matrix,\nwhat we see is that things\n\n105\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.050\nthat are at the lower left\nare often going to be things that,\n\n106\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.460\nwhile we need to pay attention to and\nwhile they may happen,\n\n107\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.110\nprobably don't hurt us very badly if they\ndo, and they don't happen very often.\n\n108\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.730\nThings that move up to the upper right as\nwe scale up and out that go from green to\n\n109\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.630\nyellow to red, indicating in\ntheory using stop light KPIs.\n\n110\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.520\nGreen being things that are stuff\nwe got to pay attention to, but\n\n111\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.020\nare not really problematic.\n\n112\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.468\nYellow caution, red danger, right?\n\n113\n00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:10.990\nSo upper right-hand corner, right, we're\noften thinking about things that happen\n\n114\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.800\nquite frequently, and things that\nare going to really hurt us if they do.\n\n115\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.010\nAnd so as a result of that,\n\n116\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.690\nwe have to think about the fact that it's\nhighly likely and extremely damaging.\n\n117\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.310\nAnd so when we think about risk\nassessment as an investigator,\n\n118\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.960\nwe have to think about\nwhat's the likelihood,\n\n119\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.260\nwhat's the consequence associated\nwith whatever it is I'm looking at.\n\n120\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.840\nIs this activity that I'm gonna engage in?\n\n121\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.520\nIs this thought process that I'm\nusing gonna be problematic or\n\n122\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.630\nis it gonna be something\nthat will be beneficial?\n\n123\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.170\nAnd so we have to understand risk\nassessment from that perspective.\n\n124\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.530\nBut we also have to think about and\nlook at the environment around us as we're\n\n125\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.500\nexamining, and investigating,\nand doing risk assessment.\n\n126\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.180\nWhat's the risk of me interacting with\nthat piece of evidence before I've\n\n127\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.880\ndocumented it?\n\n128\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.040\nWe've talked about that.\n\n129\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.580\nDon't have the layout right?\n\n130\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.390\nThe picture where the cables are we have\na high likelihood that that compromise\n\n131\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.280\nthat we're going to introduce into the\nevidence is gonna be detrimental to our\n\n132\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.900\nability to use it if we pick that\nevidence up without documenting it first.\n\n133\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.450\nWhat if we walk in on a crime scene\n\n134\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.920\nwithout anybody having been there\nno documentation of any kind And\n\n135\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.700\nas a result, trample on evidence or\nmodify the scene in someway.\n\n136\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.250\nHigh likelyhood, how consequence\nassociated with it and how likelyhood\n\n137\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.780\nthat that's going to be damaging to\nour ability to use that evidence.\n\n138\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.940\nRight?\nSo these are things we have to consider,\n\n139\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.620\nwe have to be aware of with\nregards to risk assessment.\n\n140\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.870\nSo when we think about risk assessment,\nwe think about this methodology\n\n141\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.450\nassociated with our ability to\nunderstand how to manage risk.\n\n142\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.390\nAnd remember, risk is one of\nthe two key elements we look at\n\n143\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.620\nin Information Security.\n\n144\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.080\nIt's the flip side of the coin of change.\n\n145\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.110\nChange management or\nrisk management are related concepts.\n\n146\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.280\nYou can't be good at one without\nbeing good at the other.\n\n147\n00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.060\nAnd the reason we make this connection\nwhen we talk about investigation and\n\n148\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.950\nCHFI methodology is that it's all about,\n\n149\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.420\nin our world doing what we do,\ntalking about this concept,\n\n150\n00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.120\nit's all about governing and managing\nrisk and governing and managing change.\n\n151\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.650\nBecause we're changing the environment\nby documenting and gathering evidence.\n\n152\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.600\nAnd we run a high risk But\n\n153\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.160\nif we do that incorrectly that evidence\nis not going to be able to be used.\n\n154\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.120\nSo we have to control that,\nwe have to understand that,\n\n155\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.680\nand we have to manage that.\n\n156\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.280\nWe have to, in other words,\nbecome really good at change and\n\n157\n00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.200\nrisk management to be good at being\na forensic investigator because if we\n\n158\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.430\nunderstand those concepts we're gonna\nbe able to do our job properly.\n\n159\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.310\nIf we don't, potentially we're\ngoing to run into issues right?\n\n160\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.650\nSo that's something to consider and\n\n161\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.090\nits just something to think about\nwhen we think about risk assessment.\n\n162\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.970\nI know when i was mentioning risk\nassessment you were telling me like before\n\n163\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.860\nwe got started like you know we got to do\nlike a whole show just on that cause its\n\n164\n00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.710\nso important.\n\n165\n00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.547\nBut the reality is you know we've done\nthose shows before, we've talked about\n\n166\n00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:48.382\nthis at length I have, you've heard Daniel\nand I talked about it when we did your\n\n167\n00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:52.358\ncloud computing stuff together, if you\nremember for ISC Squared, for the CCSP.\n\n168\n00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:56.368\nWe talked about it in CASP,\ntalked about it in CISSP, SSCP.\n\n169\n00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:58.086\nTalked about it in a variety in CEH,\n\n170\n00:07:58.086 --> 00:08:00.507\ntalked about it extensively\nin Ethical Hacking.\n\n171\n00:08:00.507 --> 00:08:04.202\nWe've talked about it on a lot of\ndifferent shows and episodes I've done and\n\n172\n00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:07.160\nother presenters and\nother hosts have done here at ITProTV.\n\n173\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.600\nNot just me, I'm not the only\none that speaks about this.\n\n174\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.320\nBut certainly I speak about it\na lot in relation to the stuff\n\n175\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.980\nI do with regards to security.\n\n176\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.710\nI even talked about it with regards to\nsome of the stuff I did for System Center\n\n177\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.020\nand some of the other stuff that I've done\nthat's not security related with you guys.\n\n178\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.530\nBecause it's such an important theme.\n\n179\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.370\nIt comes up in everything we do.\n\n180\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.150\nRight, I use the classic example\nwhen I talk to customers about this,\n\n181\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.330\nabout going shopping for\ngroceries when you're hungry.\n\n182\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.310\nYou ever done this?\n\n183\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:29.980\n&gt;&gt; That's a mistake.\n[LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.260\n&gt;&gt; That's a huge mistake, right?\n\n185\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.550\nBecause when you do this,\n\n186\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.150\nwhat happens is you buy a whole bunch of\nstuff that you normally wouldn't buy.\n\n187\n00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.590\nYou blow your budget, right?\n\n188\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.660\nEverything looks good.\n\n189\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.640\nYou walk through the store,\nand you just go nuts.\n\n190\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.790\nI mean,\nyou come home with a cart full of garbage.\n\n191\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.720\nAnd you just don't understand\nwhat it is you bought and why.\n\n192\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.680\n&gt;&gt; It's having bad beds feast when\nall you needed was a sandwich.\n\n193\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.260\n&gt;&gt; It's like having an out\nof body experience,\n\n194\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.830\nwhere you just lose all control and\nyou wake up, and all of sudden,\n\n195\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.140\nyou're like,\nhow did I get ten boxes of this.\n\n196\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.140\nWhat was I thinking?\n\n197\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.770\nAnd you learn this lesson but\nyou learn it once.\n\n198\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.250\nAnd there's certain things you learn,\nyou gotta learn the hard way.\n\n199\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.520\nI mean mom and dad were right when\nthey said don't play with fire,\n\n200\n00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.820\nyou're gonna get burned,\nwell you don't know until you do it.\n\n201\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.950\nBut if you're a parent, and\nyou're looking at your kid, and\n\n202\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.860\nyou're trying to protect\nthem from the world, right?\n\n203\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.420\nThere are certain things that I have this\nconversation with my wife all the time.\n\n204\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.610\nThere are certain things you've\njust gotta let kids figure out and\n\n205\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.580\nlearn how to do the hard way.\n\n206\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.720\nAnd there are certain things you could\ntell them not to do, because clearly,\n\n207\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.730\nit's gonna be very bad for\nthem if they do.\n\n208\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.380\nBut sometimes, you've just gotta let\nthem experience the pain, right?\n\n209\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.070\nBecause that's the best way for\nthem to remember.\n\n210\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.210\nSo it's the same example with this, right.\n\n211\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.390\nRisk Assessment is the kind of\nthing that you learn how to do\n\n212\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.940\nthe hard way because you\nscrew it up at some point and\n\n213\n00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.260\nyou don't realize you need to do it,\nand you never forget that lesson.\n\n214\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.730\nDon't be that person is\nwhat I'm suggesting to you.\n\n215\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.780\nBe the person that takes the advice and\ndoesn't have to learn the hard way.\n\n216\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.430\nYou're gonna be a lot happier for it.\n\n217\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.930\nAll right so, talked a bit about risk.\n\n218\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.500\nLet's talk about what that toolkit\nlooks like that I keep talking about.\n\n219\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.790\nYou hear me refer to.\n\n220\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.612\nWhat's the forensic examiner's\ntoolkit gonna look like?\n\n221\n00:09:56.612 --> 00:09:59.980\nSometimes called the first responders\ntoolkit, what's that gonna be?\n\n222\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.680\nHow do we build it?\n\n223\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.450\nWhat should it look like?\n\n224\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.900\nI almost feel like I'm\ngonna be Bob the Builder.\n\n225\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.420\nI need the the little tool belt,\n\n226\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.810\nI need the little hat, and we need\nthe actual, what else does he have?\n\n227\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.290\nHe has all those cool little machines\nthat like walk around a follow him and\n\n228\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.430\ntalk to him, right?\n\n229\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.160\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna get into all of that.\n\n230\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm not, we're right on the cusp, yeah.\n\n231\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.195\nIt's almost there.\n\n232\n00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:20.290\n&gt;&gt; Butt you missed the whole,\nBarney, the purple dinosaur?\n\n233\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.190\n&gt;&gt; We did miss Barney.\n\n234\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.232\n&gt;&gt; My god.\n&gt;&gt; But Daniel Tiger is full on,\n\n235\n00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:25.044\nthat's the thing [INAUDIBLE].\n\n236\n00:10:25.044 --> 00:10:26.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nevery generation has that thing.\n\n237\n00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:29.501\nBut mine are old enough that they,\n\n238\n00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:35.110\nespecially my oldest one went\nthrough the whole Barney thing.\n\n239\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry, my condolences.\n\n240\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.510\n&gt;&gt; My God, yes.\n\n241\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.718\nSo talk about,\njust hang my head out the window and\n\n242\n00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:42.204\nhope you hit a post while\nyou're driving down the road.\n\n243\n00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:47.190\n[LAUGH] So and we had the whole\nentertainment system in the car, right?\n\n244\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.140\nSo we would put in the video because\nback then it was videotapes.\n\n245\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.470\nYou put in the videotape that we'd\nbe watching, she'd be watching\n\n246\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.560\nthe purple dinosaur, sitting in the back\nall happy on her little TV screen.\n\n247\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.330\nAnd I'd be sitting up\nfront driving the minivan.\n\n248\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.277\nCuz you know, look at me,\nI'm driving a minivan.\n\n249\n00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:03.750\n[LAUGH] That's torture enough, right?\n\n250\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.590\nAnd so I'm driving the minivan,\nand I'm doing the Mr Mom thing and\n\n251\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.640\nI got the purple dinosaur blaring,\nand God, yeah.\n\n252\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.760\n&gt;&gt; You start singing the song, I can tell.\n\n253\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.135\n&gt;&gt; No, you just wish you could have an out\nof body experience and be somewhere else.\n\n254\n00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.435\nSo wait cuz it is coming but\nBob the Builder.\n\n255\n00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:20.285\nBob the Builder is cool.\n\n256\n00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.565\nSo let's be Bob the Builder.\n\n257\n00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:24.205\nWhat do we need to have with\nregards to our tool kit?\n\n258\n00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:26.845\nSo we gotta have a operating system,\n\n259\n00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:29.945\na variety of operating systems\nwe're gonna potentially use, right?\n\n260\n00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:31.745\nDoes everything happen\non a Windows machine?\n\n261\n00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:33.095\nI mean we often talk about this, right?\n\n262\n00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:34.995\nAnd we say well in Windows,\nthis, this and this.\n\n263\n00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.645\nBut a lot of people don't use Windows.\n\n264\n00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.010\nA lot of people use Linux.\n\n265\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.000\nLot of people use the Macintosh OS, right.\n\n266\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.900\nLot of people will operate on\nsystems that are not Windows based.\n\n267\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.900\nWe, as investigators,\nmay not have background and\n\n268\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.220\nunderstanding of all of them.\n\n269\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.648\nWe talked about the idea of partnering and\nteaming with people to do,\n\n270\n00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:55.090\nin the last episode, so we've talked about\nthe idea of having that team of experts.\n\n271\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.400\nBut we've got to have access to\nall those operating systems and\n\n272\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.400\nthe ISO is required for\nus to be able to work with them, so\n\n273\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.560\nwe understand the features and\nthe functionality.\n\n274\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.980\nWe gotta have our standard\noperating environment.\n\n275\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.330\nSo kind of our forensic\nworkstation if you will,\n\n276\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.130\nthat's got all of our\ntools installed on it.\n\n277\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.840\nSo can we go to my machine for\njust one second?\n\n278\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.960\nAnd do that of course, while we do\nthat I'm like clicking on stuff.\n\n279\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally unprepared, bad host right?\n\n280\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.200\nNot prepared for anything.\n\n281\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.070\nSo you can see that on my machine I've got\na couple of pieces of software installed.\n\n282\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.860\nWe're gonna come back and\ntake a look at a couple,\n\n283\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.245\ndo some demos here in a few minutes.\n\n284\n00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:27.553\nBut, I've got P2 commander here,\nI've got HashCalc,\n\n285\n00:12:27.553 --> 00:12:30.399\nI've got recover my files,\ngot R-Drive image.\n\n286\n00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:34.260\nGot a bunch of different tools that are\nforensics tools of one type or another.\n\n287\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.920\nAnd they'll be more of them as\nwe go through other episodes and\n\n288\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.830\ndo other things.\n\n289\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.077\nBut I got some standard stuff here.\n\n290\n00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:43.767\nI got Adobe Acrobat Reader, I got a couple\nof web browsers, got Chrome, got Firefox,\n\n291\n00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:48.110\ngot the handy-dandy recycle bin cuz\nyou can't go anywhere without that.\n\n292\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.570\nBut in addition you've got\nother stuff installed here.\n\n293\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.700\nI've got Office installed.\n\n294\n00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.240\nSo you got Word there in case you need to\nread a document or perhaps use something.\n\n295\n00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.138\nI got WinHex.\n\n296\n00:12:57.138 --> 00:13:00.942\nHex editor, we'll take a look at and\ninteract with a little bit.\n\n297\n00:13:00.942 --> 00:13:04.883\nSo there's all this different stuff, so\nyou know building out that tool kits about\n\n298\n00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:08.657\nhaving a standardized machine and then\nhaving all the tools available as well as\n\n299\n00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:11.043\nhaving the media,\nthe right protected devices.\n\n300\n00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:13.236\nI've talked about devices that are, right,\n\n301\n00:13:13.236 --> 00:13:16.740\nblockers that can be used to prevent\nthe flow of information back in.\n\n302\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.661\nBut what about simply,\nright, protected media.\n\n303\n00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:22.471\nYears ago when we used to use these\nmythical things called floppy disks,\n\n304\n00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:24.533\ngather around the campfire children,\n\n305\n00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:27.880\nlet me tell you a story about\nwhat it was like in the old days.\n\n306\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.150\nI had a conversation with one of my\nstudents recently, young, younger person\n\n307\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.440\nthan me in class and I was talking about\nfloppies and they were looking at me.\n\n308\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.942\nYou get that look that some people have,\n\n309\n00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.950\nsometimes where they believe you're\ntelling them something important but they\n\n310\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.061\njust can't really wrap their head around\nbecause they have no point of reference.\n\n311\n00:13:44.061 --> 00:13:46.376\nI have this happen with my kids,\nmy older one.\n\n312\n00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:50.064\nYou're gonna have this happen as well\nas they get older [CROSSTALK] But\n\n313\n00:13:50.064 --> 00:13:53.880\nyou know you expect them not to\nnecessarily know everything cuz they may\n\n314\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.372\nor may not understand\nsome of the technology.\n\n315\n00:13:56.372 --> 00:14:01.720\nBut at one point I was,\nmy oldest daughter, teenager, right?\n\n316\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.264\nMiddle, middle teens,\nat one point we're going somewhere and\n\n317\n00:14:05.264 --> 00:14:10.410\nshe's attached to her cell phone like\n24/7, I mean it's just how kids are today.\n\n318\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.990\nAnd, we drive by something and\n\n319\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.660\nI made a comment about, there used to be\nlike a phone booth or something there.\n\n320\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.180\nShe looks at me like,\nwhat the hell's a phone booth?\n\n321\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.311\nAnd so,\nwe have this conversation about well,\n\n322\n00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.366\nthis is a place where you could have\ngone before you had a cell phone.\n\n323\n00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:27.598\nThere was a time before cellphones, like\nyou didn't always just have a cellphone.\n\n324\n00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:29.540\nYeah, you used to actually have to stop,\npull over,\n\n325\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.350\nget out of the car, go stand on\nthe street and make a phone call.\n\n326\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.270\n&gt;&gt; Those are wonderful times.\n\n327\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta be kidding,\n\n328\n00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:36.140\nshe did not believe me.\n\n329\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.349\nI have to actually have\nher go on her phone and\n\n330\n00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:40.379\npull up a picture of\nwhat a phone booth was.\n\n331\n00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:44.298\nShe also didn't believe that, that phone\ncalls at that time would have cost\n\n332\n00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:47.680\nanywhere from a nickel to 25 cents\ndepending on how old you are.\n\n333\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.912\nI remember when phone calls\nactually cost a nickel,\n\n334\n00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:53.257\nyou can't tell that by looking at what's\nleft on my head but believe it or not,\n\n335\n00:14:53.257 --> 00:14:55.306\nit's a lot wider than it\nappears on the screen.\n\n336\n00:14:55.306 --> 00:14:59.836\nAnd I remember when you could buy soda,\nnot that I drink soda, but when I did,\n\n337\n00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:04.332\nI remember you could buy soda out of\na machine in bottles, 5 cents for soda.\n\n338\n00:15:04.332 --> 00:15:05.433\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n&gt;&gt; I'm an old son of a gun,\n\n339\n00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:06.061\nI tell you what.\n\n340\n00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:09.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I look good for\nmy age, they got me propped up.\n\n341\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.960\nYou don't see the back.\n\n342\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.180\nThere's actually like a whole crew of\npeople holding me up so I can stand up and\n\n343\n00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.060\nmake this show.\n\n344\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.440\nOtherwise I would just\nbe a blithering mess.\n\n345\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.950\nAll right, so\nwe have write protected devices.\n\n346\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.900\nAnd write protected devices I would say,\nis something like a floppy disk, right?\n\n347\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.770\nWhere, if you remember floppies, you could\nliterally just push the little tab over,\n\n348\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.320\nor break it off,\ndepending on what it was, right?\n\n349\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.410\nIf it was a tape cassette, you could break\nthe tab off the top, floppy you would\n\n350\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.610\nslide the little lever over, and\nyou'd write protect, it was very simple.\n\n351\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.490\nYou know, it's not so simple to\nwrite protect a drive today, right?\n\n352\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.820\nI mean hard drive's inside a machine.\n\n353\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.399\nYou gotta use software and\nhardware to prevent writing.\n\n354\n00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:44.490\nOld media that was removable,\nwasn't a big deal.\n\n355\n00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.430\nCan you write-protect\na removable USB device?\n\n356\n00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.640\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n357\n00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.580\nI haven't done it so long,\nI couldn't tell you.\n\n358\n00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.494\nThe answer is yes, yes you can.\n\n359\n00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can, absolutely, but\n\n360\n00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.860\nthe way you do it is different than what\nwe would do with a traditional floppy.\n\n361\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.599\nCan you write-protect SD cards?\n\n362\n00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:00.209\n&gt;&gt; I would assume so as well.\n\n363\n00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:03.010\n&gt;&gt; Of course you can, right, because\nthey are media and you can do this.\n\n364\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.332\nBut the idea is A, number one,\nyou would have to know how to do it.\n\n365\n00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.778\nAnd B, you would have to then have the\nmechanisms, the tools, the software and\n\n366\n00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:12.240\nor hardware, and\nthe knowledge to be able to do it.\n\n367\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.320\nSo this is the part of the stuff\nyou need to figure out.\n\n368\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.460\nHow about networking equipment?\n\n369\n00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.060\nDo we need to carry around cables with us?\n\n370\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.330\nWe gotta have different cables\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n371\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.130\nWe may need, for\n\n372\n00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.010\nthis crazy kind of equipment you\nguys keep making me use here.\n\n373\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.890\nWe may have fire wire, we may have network\nadapters with lightning bolts on them.\n\n374\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.824\nWhat the hell's that all about?\n\n375\n00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:31.230\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; That's called Thunderbolt.\n\n376\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, Thunderbolt,\n\n377\n00:16:32.674 --> 00:16:36.027\nright cuz that's what you want to call\nyour networking Thunderbolt, but yet\n\n378\n00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:38.778\nit still runs just like normal networking,\nit's no quicker.\n\n379\n00:16:38.778 --> 00:16:42.875\nI'd be impressed if it was at the speed\nof thunder or the speed of light, but\n\n380\n00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:47.380\nit's at the same speed as my little normal\nmachine over here that works properly.\n\n381\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.550\nAnd I love because it operates easily.\n\n382\n00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.760\nAnd there's a network port on\nthe back that I plug into and\n\n383\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.890\nit looks like a normal network port.\n\n384\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.340\n&gt;&gt; You are preaching to the choir my man.\n\n385\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.392\n&gt;&gt; Preaching to the choir,\nI'm just a bitter person what can I say.\n\n386\n00:16:55.392 --> 00:17:00.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have all this kinda stuff.\n\n387\n00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.110\nWhat about power supplies and batteries?\n\n388\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.956\nGotta have extras of those, right?\n\n389\n00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:07.154\nYou break a power supply or\nyou come up on a machine that's running,\n\n390\n00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:10.407\nlike a mobile device that has to be\nessentially kept charged to be able\n\n391\n00:17:10.407 --> 00:17:13.500\nto keep the dynamic information\nin memory available to you.\n\n392\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.810\nGotta have extra batteries,\ngotta have extra power supplies.\n\n393\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.669\nWhen you walk around with a kit like this,\nyou got phone chargers for\n\n394\n00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:19.850\nall different phones.\n\n395\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.360\nYou got batteries for different devices.\n\n396\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.724\nAt one point we used to carry around,\nyou know, all sorts, as I said,\n\n397\n00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:27.200\ndifferent network cards.\n\n398\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.370\nWe'd carry around extra hard\ndrive harnesses and devices so\n\n399\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.520\nyou could plug stuff in.\n\n400\n00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.125\nI mean, a million different things\nIt looked like it was just a crazy\n\n401\n00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:36.891\nparts store.\n\n402\n00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:38.039\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; And then I look at the bag and\n\n403\n00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.540\nit was just all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n404\n00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.056\n&gt;&gt; And then of course it is a tool kit,\nso there's gonna be screwdrivers,\n\n405\n00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:45.917\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta open up stuff,\n\n406\n00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:47.564\ntake it apart, whatever the case may be.\n\n407\n00:17:47.564 --> 00:17:51.580\nOr a lot of times your machine device\nmaybe secure down, so to actually take\n\n408\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:56.191\neverything a part of you've documented it,\nyou may have to unscrew certain things.\n\n409\n00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.325\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; You remember back in the day,\n\n410\n00:17:58.325 --> 00:18:02.927\nI don't know if you remember the old B and\nC connectors coax cable network.\n\n411\n00:18:02.927 --> 00:18:06.820\nSo you'd have those, if you remember\nwhen we have daddy had token ring.\n\n412\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.330\nIf you remember S mouse and\nmouse which were essentially the hub or\n\n413\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.980\nthe switches you would connect to.\n\n414\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:17.340\nS mouse, Smart multistation access\nunit essentially a hub for token ring.\n\n415\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.482\nIt would have these gator\nclip-like devices right.\n\n416\n00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:21.920\nYou would pinch the thing\nit would open up and\n\n417\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.460\nyou would then plug it in and\nit would lock in place.\n\n418\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.310\nSo its a crazy kind of connector\nyou have to have tools to work\n\n419\n00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.210\nwith some of this stuff to be\nable to disconnect these things.\n\n420\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.450\nYeah today you just unplug something,\nit's real simple.\n\n421\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.950\nBut there was a time where we would\nscrew some of these things down and\n\n422\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.250\nactually lock them in place.\n\n423\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.950\n&gt;&gt; And the old vampire taps for that.\n\n424\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.235\nYou had to actually bite through\nthe cable with these connectors.\n\n425\n00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:44.495\nSo, they would make\ncontact physically inside.\n\n426\n00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:45.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And join them together.\n\n427\n00:18:45.485 --> 00:18:46.775\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we call it tapping wire.\n\n428\n00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:49.105\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Tapping the case, back in the day.\n\n429\n00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:50.125\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; So much better back then.\n\n430\n00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:51.646\nThings were so much simpler, right?\n\n431\n00:18:51.646 --> 00:18:53.985\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 10 megabit, right coax cable.\n\n432\n00:18:53.985 --> 00:18:54.497\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n433\n00:18:54.497 --> 00:18:57.167\nVampire tap and a BNC connector,\nyou were good forever.\n\n434\n00:18:57.167 --> 00:18:58.457\nIt was just perfect stuff.\n\n435\n00:18:58.457 --> 00:19:01.193\nSo you'd have to build-\n&gt;&gt; Just put on a leisure suit.\n\n436\n00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:02.887\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you'd also have network cards.\n\n437\n00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:04.667\nSo this was the other thing\nyou'd also have to carry around.\n\n438\n00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:08.008\nNot so much cuz you need to put a separate\nnetwork card in, but you would have to\n\n439\n00:19:08.008 --> 00:19:12.088\nactually have the drivers to make sure\nthat you could connect everything up.\n\n440\n00:19:12.088 --> 00:19:13.498\nWe used to carry around software.\n\n441\n00:19:13.498 --> 00:19:16.538\nJust all this crazy stuff\nthat you would have to have.\n\n442\n00:19:16.538 --> 00:19:20.860\nI would have shopping carts and\nassistants just dragging stuff.\n\n443\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.780\nWherever we would go.\n\n444\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.805\n&gt;&gt; Bring the van around.\n\n445\n00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:24.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back it up,\n\n446\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.430\nset the whole tent up,\nthe whole nine yards, right?\n\n447\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.480\nSo yeah, there's all these things.\n\n448\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.980\nI've seen tool kits that\ninvolve power generators\n\n449\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.730\ncuz you may be in a remote location.\n\n450\n00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.590\nYou gotta run power to run light so\nyou can examine things outside.\n\n451\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.810\nWe often are talking about this from the\ncomputer perspective, and you're thinking,\n\n452\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.200\nyeah, it's gonna be a crime scene, right.\n\n453\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.360\nWe're gonna be in a building,\nthere's lighting.\n\n454\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.990\nThere's HVAC, you've got climate control.\n\n455\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.590\nYou can plug in, there's power.\n\n456\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.060\nI mean yeah,\nin traditional environments normally yeah,\n\n457\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.380\nwhat about if you get called out to\na cabin in the middle of the woods?\n\n458\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.000\nRight, where there may not\nbe anything out there.\n\n459\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.190\nI mean you've gotta bring everything\nwith you potentially is my point, right.\n\n460\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.310\nSo this tool kit can look like\na variety of different things.\n\n461\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.230\nIt may look like a survival kit\nas much as it does anything else.\n\n462\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.140\nSo there have been some crazy\nplaces I've had to do work, and\n\n463\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.300\nsome crazy activities and circumstances\nI've had to operate under and with.\n\n464\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:20.010\nI've been literally out on a beach on\nrelatively, almost like a deserted island\n\n465\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.610\nin a basically nothing more than a palm\nfrond shack having to do some work for\n\n466\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.020\na customer because that was\nbasically where things happened.\n\n467\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.230\nAnd you're in the middle of nowhere.\n\n468\n00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.070\nI mean, it's a cool place.\n\n469\n00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.190\nYou can go scuba diving and\ntake a break, do a little fishing.\n\n470\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.630\nBut when you gotta work,\nthere isn't much around.\n\n471\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.800\nSo, it just depends on what you're doing.\n\n472\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.240\nPoint is boy scout motto,\nalways be prepared.\n\n473\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.610\nYou gotta have whatever you need with you.\n\n474\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.660\nBecause when you deploy into the field,\nyou never know what the circumstances\n\n475\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.060\nare that you're gonna\npotentially come up against.\n\n476\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.220\nSo you just gotta think about that, right.\n\n477\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.700\nWe've talked about the methodology\ninvolved with going through and\n\n478\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.390\nactually doing the investigative process.\n\n479\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.430\nAnd then the 14 step methodology.\n\n480\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.900\nI know we noted it out in\none of our prior shows.\n\n481\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.070\nAnd I know it's gonna\nbe in the show notes so\n\n482\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.020\nI'm just gonna quickly run\nthrough it again for you.\n\n483\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.300\nCuz I want again to condense it down and\nactually give you a slightly\n\n484\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.350\nsmaller version of it just to give\nyou a better way to remember it all.\n\n485\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.060\nSo the 14 step process.\n\n486\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.630\nShould have had you\nactually create a list,\n\n487\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.850\nwe could have thrown it up on the screen.\n\n488\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.550\nIdentify the computer crime,\ncollect preliminary evidence,\n\n489\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.350\nobtain the court warrant for\ndiscovery procedure if required.\n\n490\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.130\nRemember that's an optional\nstep in step three.\n\n491\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.030\nPerform first responder procedures,\nseize the evidence at the crime scene,\n\n492\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.740\ntransport evidence securely to the lab,\nthat's step six right?\n\n493\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.270\nCreate bit stream copies of the evidence\nthat typically at least two or\n\n494\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.630\nit may do more than two it\ndepends on what you're doing.\n\n495\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.040\nNumber eight generate the checksum\nof the image, MD5, shy one, CRC 32,\n\n496\n00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.020\nI'm gonna show you how to do a checksum\nhash here in just a minute we're gonna\n\n497\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.640\ndo a little demo of that Go ahead and\nmaintain chain of custody of evidence.\n\n498\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.210\nWe talked about that as step nine.\n\n499\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.920\nTalked about the importance of that being\nin step nine as we start to broaden access\n\n500\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.770\nto the evidence after we've gathered it,\nhaving a lot of people coming in and\n\n501\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.570\nworking with it.\n\n502\n00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.240\nWe went through and\ntalked about that idea.\n\n503\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.850\nStoring original evidence\nin a secure location.\n\n504\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.800\nSo climate controlled,\nhumidity controlled, things like that.\n\n505\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.580\nAnalyse the image copies for evidence.\n\n506\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.940\nSo go through and work on the copies.\n\n507\n00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.351\nThe standing rule is never ever under\nany circumstances use the original.\n\n508\n00:22:15.351 --> 00:22:18.798\nYou always use copies that\nare forensically certified as being like\n\n509\n00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:21.800\nthe original, but\nyou never operate on the original.\n\n510\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.060\nIt's an incredibly important concept for\nus.\n\n511\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.200\nIf you do that, you're done.\n\n512\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.810\nWe actually have a name for\nthat, by the way.\n\n513\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.440\nWe call that an RGE.\n\n514\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.310\nYou know what RGE stands for?\n\n515\n00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.923\n&gt;&gt; I do, that's a resume generating event.\n\n516\n00:22:32.923 --> 00:22:34.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A resume generation event,\n\n517\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.360\nthat is what RGE stands for.\n\n518\n00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.650\nSo you don't wanna be that guy or\nthat girl, right?\n\n519\n00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.580\nYou do not wanna have an RGE occur.\n\n520\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.530\nSo never operate [LAUGH]\non the original media.\n\n521\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.300\nI've had people do that, they've looked at\nme afterwards and said this is what I did.\n\n522\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.930\nAnd I just you don't know what to\nsay to somebody at that point.\n\n523\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.010\nYou know they're basically,\n\n524\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.765\nthey've created this essentially\nthey've done the worst thing possible.\n\n525\n00:22:53.765 --> 00:22:55.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna make them feel worse\n\n526\n00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.280\nthan they already do.\n\n527\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.560\nBut you just you have to explain to they\nessentially did something really bad.\n\n528\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.160\nThey did something really wrong, right.\n\n529\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.830\nSo make sure we do that, prepare for\n\n530\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.360\nforensics, prepare as\nI trip over my tongue.\n\n531\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.740\nPrepare a forensics report to report\nout what you're doing, right.\n\n532\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.728\nSubmit the report to\nwhoever the client is.\n\n533\n00:23:12.728 --> 00:23:16.240\nAnd then ultimately testify in court as\nan expert witness, remember if required.\n\n534\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.890\nAgain, that step may be optional.\n\n535\n00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.950\nYou may not always see\nthis go to a court of law.\n\n536\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.020\nLet's streamline that down a little bit,\n\n537\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.880\nlet's get that down maybe eight or\nnine steps.\n\n538\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.180\nSo we condensed that, how does that look?\n\n539\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.810\nUltimately obtain court warrant for\ndiscovery or\n\n540\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.960\ncensure of evidence if required,\nagain always start in there.\n\n541\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.522\nBecause remember we may be able to grab\nthat evidence without a court warrant or\n\n542\n00:23:35.522 --> 00:23:36.970\na court order, but we may not.\n\n543\n00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.710\nWe may be able to safeguard the scene and\nsecure it while waiting on a warrant.\n\n544\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.780\nWe may not be able to legally go grab\nthat evidence without a warrant.\n\n545\n00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.100\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n546\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.430\nEvaluate and secure the scenes.\n\n547\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.710\nStep two, collect evidence,\n\n548\n00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:53.290\nsecure evidence, acquired data,\nanalyze data, assess evidence.\n\n549\n00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.841\nStep seven, prepare report and\n\n550\n00:23:54.841 --> 00:23:57.663\nagain testifying court if\nrequired as an expert witness.\n\n551\n00:23:57.663 --> 00:24:01.736\nSo we condense that down a little bit we\nget it to about nine steps that give us\n\n552\n00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:04.919\nthe same essential thought process,\nthe same playbook.\n\n553\n00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:07.490\nBut it's a little bit easier to work with,\na little bit easier to manage.\n\n554\n00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.089\nWe need to understand the methodology and\nthe steps involved.\n\n555\n00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:13.487\nIt's really important for us to have\na sense of how to do this and the steps\n\n556\n00:24:13.487 --> 00:24:17.730\ninvolved with going through, and making\nit sure that it's done the right way.\n\n557\n00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.561\nWhat I want to do in the last few minutes\nwe have left cuz Daniel hasn't done his\n\n558\n00:24:20.561 --> 00:24:21.661\nlittle peace sign for me yet.\n\n559\n00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:22.694\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].\n\n560\n00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.485\nYou got three minutes left.\n\n561\n00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:26.450\n&gt;&gt; That's what I said, you haven't done\nit yet, so that's why I was about to say.\n\n562\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.320\nThat I have enough time to do a demo,\nbut if you keep interrupting me,\n\n563\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.560\nI'm not gonna get that done.\n\n564\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.740\nSo, let's go over here to my machine.\n\n565\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.590\nLet's take a look real quick.\n\n566\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.700\nI wanna show you how we actually\nforensically certify an image as being\n\n567\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.440\nsound by creating a hash.\n\n568\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.315\nNow, we've done this demo in other shows\nfor other topics, not here, for CHFI,\n\n569\n00:24:44.315 --> 00:24:46.093\nbut I've done this in CISSP.\n\n570\n00:24:46.093 --> 00:24:47.104\nI've done it in SSCP,\n\n571\n00:24:47.104 --> 00:24:50.300\ndone it in CASP, I've done this\nexact demo in a variety of places.\n\n572\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.920\nBut, you may not have seen those shows,\nand,\n\n573\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.700\nas a result, it's always important\nto go back over that ground, and\n\n574\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.600\nensure that you understand,\nunder the context of our environment here.\n\n575\n00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.550\nBut, if you've seen them already, then\nit's never a bad idea to watch it more\n\n576\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.340\nthan once, right, because it's\nexciting and compelling television.\n\n577\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.113\nThat's what we do here at ITPro.TV.\n\n578\n00:25:05.113 --> 00:25:06.125\nAll right, so let's take a look.\n\n579\n00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:08.397\nWe're gonna use this tool called HashCalc,\n\n580\n00:25:08.397 --> 00:25:10.680\nthis is a freely available\nHash calculator.\n\n581\n00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.941\nYou could download this off the web,\nnot difficult to find.\n\n582\n00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.480\nYou know I like using software\nthat's free and available,\n\n583\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.324\nbecause number one it gives our\nviewers the ability to interact and\n\n584\n00:25:19.324 --> 00:25:22.590\ndo the kind of things we're doing and\nhave those skills and practice.\n\n585\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.442\nBut it's also valuable for us in the real\nworld to be able to use tools that\n\n586\n00:25:26.442 --> 00:25:30.692\nare available, that are prevalent and\nthat people are gonna be familiar with.\n\n587\n00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:32.783\nSo that we have knowledge\nof the kind of skills and\n\n588\n00:25:32.783 --> 00:25:35.233\ntools that the forensic\ninvestigator is gonna be using.\n\n589\n00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:36.160\n&gt;&gt; Plus they're cheap.\n\n590\n00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.765\n&gt;&gt; And they're cheap.\n\n591\n00:25:36.765 --> 00:25:39.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I do forensic work,\n\n592\n00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:42.902\nyou know I will use a free tool like this\nto be able to create a hash because I\n\n593\n00:25:42.902 --> 00:25:44.980\ndon't need an expensive hashing tool.\n\n594\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.250\nA hash is a hash right.\n\n595\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.090\nI mean at the end of the day.\n\n596\n00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.750\nIt doesn't matter how you create it, terms\nof how much money you spent with the tool.\n\n597\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.490\nWhat matters is the algorithm used and\n\n598\n00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.690\nthe fact that you use the same data\neverytime you do it to validate the hash.\n\n599\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.990\nSo let's explain what I mean by that and\nlet me show you that.\n\n600\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.500\nSo with a tool like this I can use file,\nI can hash a text string,\n\n601\n00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.530\na hex string, for a drive image,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n602\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.550\nI'm gonna just do a text string just for\npurposes of demonstration.\n\n603\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.520\nSo let's say that I do the dog,\n\n604\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.100\nif I can manage to type with\nthe caps lock being off.\n\n605\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.160\nThe dog is red.\n\n606\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.050\nI got caps lock.\n\n607\n00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.740\nHow do I keep,\nI know how I keep doing that.\n\n608\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.090\nThere we go, okay, that's why.\n\n609\n00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.650\nAll right, so the dog is red,\nwith a period there, right?\n\n610\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.955\nThis is live TV folks, this is what\nhappens in the real world, right?\n\n611\n00:26:36.955 --> 00:26:40.105\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nlet me just paste this in here, so\n\n612\n00:26:40.105 --> 00:26:44.310\nwe can see what the text is,\nthat we are creating the hash with, right?\n\n613\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.500\nThe dog is red, period.\n\n614\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:53.046\nSo I'm gonna check off the algorithms\nthat I wanna use, MD5 among others.\n\n615\n00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:55.146\nA lot of the ones you've\nheard me reference already.\n\n616\n00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:58.033\nI'm gonna hit calculate and\nI'm gonna get a hash\n\n617\n00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:02.270\nthat's gonna represent this data\nusing these different algorithms.\n\n618\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:06.561\nNow the trick with hashing is to\nunderstand that the algorithm used will\n\n619\n00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:08.572\ndictate the fixed-bit output.\n\n620\n00:27:08.572 --> 00:27:11.510\nAnd we actually have a little formula\nthat we can use to help us remember this.\n\n621\n00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.911\nSo, let's just put the formula in here\nreal quickly just so you can see this.\n\n622\n00:27:15.911 --> 00:27:21.970\nSo the formula is\nvariable size data input.\n\n623\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.570\nSo any kind of data, anything from\na single bit all the way up to\n\n624\n00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:30.160\nall recorded knowledge ever created under\nanybody for all time in human history.\n\n625\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.720\nIt doesn't matter, any amount of data,\nirrelevant the amount.\n\n626\n00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.540\nVariable size data input\nplus hashing algorithm.\n\n627\n00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.050\nAnd that hashing algorithm can be md5,\nshy1, you see there's a whole bunch there.\n\n628\n00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.423\nThis equals fixed bit stream.\n\n629\n00:27:48.423 --> 00:27:53.730\nFixed bit stream output.\n\n630\n00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:59.870\nAnd what I mean by that is that it will be\na certain amount of alpha numeric bytes,\n\n631\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:05.460\n128 bytes for MD5, 160 for\nShy1, RipeMD 160 160 bytes,\n\n632\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.151\nCRC32 32 bytes, Shy256 256 bytes.\n\n633\n00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:10.500\nYou get the idea, right.\n\n634\n00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.970\nSo if we know the algorithm used,\n\n635\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:17.070\nwe know what to expect in terms of the\nsize of the output, right, the byte size.\n\n636\n00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.670\nSo that's what we want to understand.\n\n637\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.820\nSo, as a result we do this and\nlet's do MD5.\n\n638\n00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.390\nWe'll take this right here.\n\n639\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.860\nWe'll copy this.\n\n640\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.360\nGo over here and we'll put this down here.\n\n641\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.620\nAnd, we'll do MD5.\n\n642\n00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.830\nI'm having trouble using\nthe keyboard today.\n\n643\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.508\nAnd there we go.\n\n644\n00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:43.217\nWe'll put the MD5 hash string in there,\nand we can see it's a 128 bytes, and\n\n645\n00:28:43.217 --> 00:28:48.750\nwe can see the actual sequencing, A0E5F44\nwhatever, all the way through, right?\n\n646\n00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.670\nSo now, I come back here, and\n\n647\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:56.530\nI modify this data in some way,\nthe harsh should be different.\n\n648\n00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.537\nIf I keep the data the same\nthe harsh should be the same.\n\n649\n00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.467\nAnd this is the value, the simplicity but\n\n650\n00:29:01.467 --> 00:29:04.540\nthe value and the integrity\nmechanism associated with hashing.\n\n651\n00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.062\nThis is why we use the hash to verify\nthe forensic integrity of a drive image or\n\n652\n00:29:09.062 --> 00:29:10.350\nany evidence.\n\n653\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.451\nBecause if we take that hash, and\n\n654\n00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.513\nassociate that string with the data\nat the moment we capture it.\n\n655\n00:29:16.513 --> 00:29:20.270\nIn theory, if we never modify that\ndata at any point in the future,\n\n656\n00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.158\nthat hash is gonna be identical.\n\n657\n00:29:22.158 --> 00:29:25.860\nIf the data is the same, in other words,\nthe hash will be the same.\n\n658\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.780\nAnd this creates the ability for\nus to go forward in time and\n\n659\n00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.920\nsay, six months from now,\nhey, let me pull that file.\n\n660\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.090\nLet me compare it.\n\n661\n00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.300\nIf the hash is the same,\nthen the data has not been modified,\n\n662\n00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.988\nit's forensically sound.\n\n663\n00:29:37.988 --> 00:29:41.542\nIf the hash has changed,\nwe know one thing and one thing only.\n\n664\n00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:42.700\nThe data has been modified.\n\n665\n00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.560\nWe don't know how, we may not know when,\nby who or under what circumstances.\n\n666\n00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.900\nTwo or four what end.\n\n667\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.040\nBut we know one thing.\n\n668\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.100\nThe data is not the same as\nthe data we started with.\n\n669\n00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.180\nAnd for us that's good enough.\n\n670\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.370\nThat's all we need to know.\n\n671\n00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.740\nThat tells us equivalently\nthat the data forensically\n\n672\n00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.870\nis not sound because it has been modified.\n\n673\n00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.240\nIt is not the same.\n\n674\n00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.140\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n675\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.580\nWe've waited, what,\na couple of minutes now, approximately?\n\n676\n00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.490\nSo, if I run the hash again,\nand let's actually do this.\n\n677\n00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.480\nLet's not fool our studio audience\ninto thinking that we're doing\n\n678\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.700\nsomething we're not doing.\n\n679\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.650\nLet's be transparent.\n\n680\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:13.730\nLet's close the tools, so\n\n681\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.010\nthere's no way that I could possibly\nhave stored that hash, right?\n\n682\n00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.770\nLet's open up the tool again.\n\n683\n00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.984\nNotice my hands will never leave\nmy body during this demonstration.\n\n684\n00:30:21.984 --> 00:30:24.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At any point in time.\n\n685\n00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.900\nNor does my nose ever leave my face.\n\n686\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.400\nAll right, so we're gonna put\nthe exact string back in again, right.\n\n687\n00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.050\nOur string, let's move this over here so\nyou can see this.\n\n688\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.280\nOur string was the dog is\nred period capital T right.\n\n689\n00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.860\nSo let's do that.\n\n690\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.948\nThe dog is red period capital T,\ngot our algorithm selected\n\n691\n00:30:40.948 --> 00:30:45.795\nwe're only gonna worry about MD5 but\nwe got them all let's run that.\n\n692\n00:30:45.795 --> 00:30:50.924\nLet's take that and let's go over here and\n\n693\n00:30:50.924 --> 00:30:58.063\nlet's do the following,\nlet me just do that, do I copy it?\n\n694\n00:30:58.063 --> 00:31:01.150\nLet me just copy it, one second here,\nI don't remember if I actually hit copy.\n\n695\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.700\nI think I just highlighted it.\n\n696\n00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.490\nLet's just come down here,\nlet's just do MD5 again.\n\n697\n00:31:08.937 --> 00:31:12.590\nAnd you can see that I\nhave not changed the data.\n\n698\n00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.850\nThe input is identical, and\n\n699\n00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.090\nif you take a look, you can see\nthe comparison lined up right there.\n\n700\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.660\nBit for bit, right?\n\n701\n00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.840\nThe bits are the same.\n\n702\n00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.111\nIn other words,\nthe output of the hash is the same.\n\n703\n00:31:22.111 --> 00:31:24.530\nThe sequencing of the alpha\nnumeric characters is the same.\n\n704\n00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.570\nThe hash value is identical.\n\n705\n00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.590\nThe data in other words\nhas not been modified.\n\n706\n00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.910\nWe have integrity,\nthat's what that proves.\n\n707\n00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.554\nNow if I change that.\n\n708\n00:31:37.332 --> 00:31:42.889\nAnd we do the dog is red\nwithout a period okay.\n\n709\n00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:45.620\nSo I'm just highlighting that so\nyou can't really see when I highlight it.\n\n710\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.820\nBut the dog is red with no period, right?\n\n711\n00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.520\nLet's take a look.\n\n712\n00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.283\nAnd let's see what that looks like.\n\n713\n00:31:51.283 --> 00:31:55.530\nSo let's just come in here,\nget rid of the period, run it again.\n\n714\n00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.160\nAnd we'll notice, you don't even have to,\nhave to have me paste it to see it,\n\n715\n00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.700\nif you could see it on the screen.\n\n716\n00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.560\nI know it maybe hard to see so\nlet me paste it.\n\n717\n00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.241\nBut you'll see that the hash value of\nthe output is actually different now And\n\n718\n00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:08.787\nas a result,\nmove the cross hair out of the way there,\n\n719\n00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:12.126\nas a result even the slightest\nmodification with a single bit of data,\n\n720\n00:32:12.126 --> 00:32:15.090\njust removing the period,\nis enough to change the hash.\n\n721\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.260\nMeaning the integrity of the data has\nbeen compromised and as a result we can\n\n722\n00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.260\ntell that by doing something as simple as\nthis when we create those forensic images,\n\n723\n00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.120\nthose bit stream copies, we can certify\neach image is identical to the original\n\n724\n00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.700\nby creating a hash value\nof the original drive.\n\n725\n00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.280\nAnd notice that when we're hashing it,\nwe're not modifying the data in any way,\n\n726\n00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.810\nwe're just representing\nit cryptographically.\n\n727\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.960\nSo taking a hash of the original data,\n\n728\n00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.700\nin this case of the entire drive, is not\ngonna affect the forensic information and\n\n729\n00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.060\nthe soundness of\nthe information in the drive.\n\n730\n00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.810\nIt is a nonintrusive, noninvasive,\nnondestructive process, so\n\n731\n00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:52.410\nit's acceptable to do that,\nto certify the original,\n\n732\n00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.260\nthen to do the same thing against\nthe copies, made forensically in a way,\n\n733\n00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.990\nthat does not allow a write back and\nas a result, does not modify the data.\n\n734\n00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.270\nThose hashes should be identical and\nbecause they are identical,\n\n735\n00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.090\nwe could certify the copies are gonna\nbe identical to the original.\n\n736\n00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.670\nWe can work on the copies as if\nwe were working on the original.\n\n737\n00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.432\nAnd anything we find there\nis gonna be in the original,\n\n738\n00:33:14.432 --> 00:33:17.683\neven though we are not using the original,\nif that makes sense.\n\n739\n00:33:17.683 --> 00:33:20.666\nAnd as a result, by the way even if\nit doesn't, cuz it makes sense and\n\n740\n00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:21.861\nthat's what you gotta do.\n\n741\n00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:24.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But as a result of that,\n\n742\n00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.030\nwe now know unequivocally and\nauthoritatively as we examine and\n\n743\n00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:32.650\nanalyze, anything found in those copies is\nindeed inherently there in the original,\n\n744\n00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.180\neven though we're not using the original.\n\n745\n00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.692\nThis is the process we engage in,\nthis is why it's so important for\n\n746\n00:33:37.692 --> 00:33:40.766\nus to understand how to make those copies,\nand soundly and\n\n747\n00:33:40.766 --> 00:33:45.311\nforensically examine them and certify them\nusing a hash as you're seeing me do here.\n\n748\n00:33:45.311 --> 00:33:48.629\n&gt;&gt; That's a very, very cool technique,\nand it's actually a handy thing for\n\n749\n00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:51.170\nyou to be able to do just in\ngeneral as an IT professional.\n\n750\n00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.350\nBecause other than we're downloading\nthings off the Internet,\n\n751\n00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.880\nyou want to verify that what\nyou've downloaded is what you\n\n752\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.140\nwanted to have downloaded and\nnot some sort of malicious software.\n\n753\n00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.950\nSo, a lot of times you'll see\npeople offer an MD 5 Hash or\n\n754\n00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.730\na SHA 1 Hash, SHA 256,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n755\n00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.100\nAnd then you can run the algorithm\nback on what you downloaded,\n\n756\n00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.890\nmake sure that those values match up and\nyou've got the right thing.\n\n757\n00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.780\nAnd it's good practice so\nthat when you're doing CHFI type work.\n\n758\n00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.870\nWell that's just something easy that you\nknow how to do because you do it all\n\n759\n00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.380\nthe time.\n\n760\n00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.490\nIt's a very good technique,\nvery good stuff.\n\n761\n00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:25.530\nWe've gone through a lot\nof great stuff already.\n\n762\n00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.108\nI know we like Adam said at the beginning\nof the show part four as well,\n\n763\n00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.660\non its way here, if not five.\n\n764\n00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.752\n&gt;&gt; In fact you already recorded it,\n\n765\n00:34:31.752 --> 00:34:33.984\nwe're just gonna play it back while\nwe go get coffee and lunch, so.\n\n766\n00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:36.694\n&gt;&gt; We'd love to speak about it\nanachronistically in our shows, so\n\n767\n00:34:36.694 --> 00:34:38.610\n[LAUGH] like it's already occurred.\n\n768\n00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.280\nWith that being said, this episode\nhas definitely come to a close.\n\n769\n00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.860\nWe thank you guys for watching, Adam\nthanks again so much for your time and\n\n770\n00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.540\neffort on this.\n\n771\n00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.820\nAnd we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n772\n00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.317\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n773\n00:34:49.317 --> 00:34:50.200\n&gt;&gt; I'm an MB5 half.\n\n774\n00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.405\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n775\n00:34:51.405 --> 00:34:52.269\n&gt;&gt; 128 bits, 128.\n\n776\n00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:54.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n777\n00:34:54.065 -->

00:00:06.664\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:08.446\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:12.111\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.203\n[SOUND] All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.203 --> 00:00:16.548\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:17.861\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:18.886\nAnd in today's episode, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:21.025\nSong and Dance is joining us yet\nagain for CHFI, that's right.\n\n11\n00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I tried to get separate.\n\n12\n00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.687\nI couldn't quite get the post right,\nI was like in between the two.\n\n13\n00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:28.634\n&gt;&gt; You can probably hear the disembodied\nhead [LAUGH] of Adam Gordon joining\n\n14\n00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:29.720\nus today.\n\n15\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.300\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n16\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.640\nHow's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good, it's good.\n\n18\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.992\nAll right, so\nlet's do this part four thing, right?\n\n19\n00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:39.745\nSo we're gonna continue to talk a little\nbit more about investigative process\n\n20\n00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:40.336\nand procedure.\n\n21\n00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:44.135\nYou know, we've been talking about the\nmechanisms, the ways in which we do this,\n\n22\n00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:47.065\nhow we build our team, how we account for\nthe knowledge we need,\n\n23\n00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:51.420\nhow we're aware of the legal precedents\nand the jurisdiction requirements we have.\n\n24\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.170\nThese are all things that are important.\n\n25\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.230\nI've talked a little bit about how\nwe search, whether we search with or\n\n26\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.890\nwithout a warrant depending on\nwho we are and what we're doing.\n\n27\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.610\nDo we represent law enforcement?\n\n28\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.500\nAre we acting as essentially an interested\nthird party, but not an official agent?\n\n29\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.049\nAnd there's some legal precedent for this.\n\n30\n00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.678\nAnd you do need to be aware of the case\ncitations or at least have knowledge of,\n\n31\n00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.032\nin the United States,\n\n32\n00:01:13.032 --> 00:01:16.790\nagain being specific,\nthis is US federal regulatory law.\n\n33\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.580\nThis, our US cases in the Supreme Court\ntraditionally that we cite here.\n\n34\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.135\nWe wanna just be aware of this kind of\nstuff and know where it comes from.\n\n35\n00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:26.250\nIn regards to,\ncan I search without a warrant,\n\n36\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.850\nthere are two cases that really\nset the foundation for this.\n\n37\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.550\nWe'll give you the full case\ncitations in the notes for the show.\n\n38\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.156\nI was gonna say the case notes, but\nthat would not be what we call them.\n\n39\n00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:38.130\nThat's what we called them in law school,\nthat's not what we call them here.\n\n40\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.363\nBut imminent destruction of evidence, and\n\n41\n00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:44.647\nthe ability to search without a warrant if\nwe fear that there is imminent destruction\n\n42\n00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:48.230\nof evidence about to take place,\nwe call this exigent circumstance.\n\n43\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.499\nAs a law enforcement official, or anybody\nfor that matter, if I fear that evidence\n\n44\n00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:59.102\nis about to destroyed, I'm looking at you\nand you're trying to light a fire, right?\n\n45\n00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're holding a piece of paper in your\n\n46\n00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:04.029\nhand, and I'm telling you, don't do that,\nyou're trying to set it on fire,\n\n47\n00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.232\nthat's an imminent threat\nto destroy evidence.\n\n48\n00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:10.042\nI have the right to gain access to that\nevidence, grab it without a warrant, and\n\n49\n00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:12.412\nprevent you from destroying it legally.\n\n50\n00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:15.342\nThis is a right that has been granted\nthrough a series of cases that\n\n51\n00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:16.442\nwent through the courts.\n\n52\n00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:19.562\nUltimately the case was\nUnited States versus David.\n\n53\n00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:21.512\nYou'll find out about the full citation,\n\n54\n00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:23.482\nnot that you're gonna go look\nup the case and read it.\n\n55\n00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:24.452\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:28.870\nBut it's just good to be aware of the\ncitations that exist if you're planning,\n\n57\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.020\nultimately, on going through and\nsitting for the CHFI exam.\n\n58\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.260\nKnowledge of, generally,\nwhere these things come from.\n\n59\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.170\nKnowledge of where we get\nthese ideas about the laws and\n\n60\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.860\nhow they operate is\nalways valuable to know.\n\n61\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.500\nSo United States versus David,\n\n62\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.950\nimminent destruction of evidence,\nthat's the case that's cited there.\n\n63\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.320\nAlso, another reason you can\nsearch without a warrant,\n\n64\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.640\nconsent of person with authority.\n\n65\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.500\nI talked about this with Daniel\nin the prior episode where we\n\n66\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.490\ntalked about the fact that if he was\nmaybe the manager of this location.\n\n67\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.406\nI showed up and said, hey, Daniel,\nwill you give me the right to do this?\n\n68\n00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:02.565\nAnd Daniel, as the official legal\nrepresentative or manager or\n\n69\n00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:06.590\nperson in authority, says yes,\nthat's good enough in the eyes of the law.\n\n70\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.030\nThere's a reason for that.\n\n71\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.520\nThe case is called Schneckloth versus\nBustamonte, and that case establishes\n\n72\n00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.570\nthe fact that a person with authority over\nthe environment can consent to a search.\n\n73\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.750\nAnd if they do so, then they are allowed\nto give you that authority, and\n\n74\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.030\nyou don't need to have a warrant\nin order to do a search.\n\n75\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.440\nSo again, this specifies that law\nenforcement agents can operate without\n\n76\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.950\nwarrants in certain circumstances.\n\n77\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.310\nWanna be aware of that.\n\n78\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.390\nWe also have requirements to\nsearch with a warrant, and\n\n79\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.250\nwe'll talk about those\nat some point as well.\n\n80\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.010\nBut we do wanna know the reasons why\nwe can search without a warrant, and\n\n81\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.630\nthese two cases give us\nthe ability to do that.\n\n82\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.410\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n83\n00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.570\nWhat do I see and what do I need to know?\n\n84\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.720\nWhat do I see when I look at evidence, and\n\n85\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.280\nhow do I understand how\nto interact with it?\n\n86\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.058\nWe've talked about the thought\nprocesses behind this, but\n\n87\n00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:55.555\nwhen an incident occurs we should be\ngathering the following information.\n\n88\n00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:56.685\nIt's very important to think about this.\n\n89\n00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:58.212\nSo, things like date and time.\n\n90\n00:03:58.212 --> 00:03:59.865\nI mentioned this will be important.\n\n91\n00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.745\nWhen did it happen, as close to\nthe approximate date and time as possible.\n\n92\n00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:05.635\nNow, if we're not there to\nsee this happen, right?\n\n93\n00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:08.425\nWe're not standing in the room when\nthis occurs, how are we gonna know?\n\n94\n00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:11.087\nWell I mentioned there may be\nclosed circuit TV monitoring.\n\n95\n00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:12.777\nThere could be a timestamp on a machine.\n\n96\n00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.797\nWe have log files that tell\nus when something occurred.\n\n97\n00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.087\nAnd we have to understand\nforensically how to gather evidence\n\n98\n00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:22.277\nfrom around the environment\nthat can link to and\n\n99\n00:04:22.277 --> 00:04:25.467\nindicate the time of event or\nthe sequence of events.\n\n100\n00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:31.510\nMaybe there is a machine that we're gonna\nexamine or maybe there is a mobile device\n\n101\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.080\nor something like that, and the clock\nis frozen at a certain moment in time.\n\n102\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.120\nMaybe it's frozen because that's\nwhen the device was attacked or\n\n103\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.380\nwhen something happened, right?\n\n104\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.340\nSo there's lots of ways for\nus to put two and two together and\n\n105\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.610\ncome up with this, but\nwe have to understand how this happened.\n\n106\n00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.240\nWe may, for instance, walk into a room.\n\n107\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.350\nWe may see yesterday's\nnewspaper sitting on the table.\n\n108\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.012\nWe know that something happened between\nyesterday and today because the newspaper\n\n109\n00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:59.464\nis there, gives us authoritatively the day\nand time of the publication that we\n\n110\n00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:02.940\ncan unequivocally attribute, right,\nauthoritatively to that newspaper.\n\n111\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.250\nWe can say,\nwell that's yesterday's headlines.\n\n112\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.720\nSomebody was here and\nbought that paper with them, and so\n\n113\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.380\nwe know as of yesterday this person\nwas still alive and in this room.\n\n114\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.960\nBut after that we're not sure, right?\n\n115\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.060\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of ways we can do this.\n\n116\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.700\nBank transactions, ATM records,\npayment receipts that have date and\n\n117\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.710\ntime stamps on them.\n\n118\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.941\nYou'd be surprised what we\ncan use as evidence, right?\n\n119\n00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.540\nWe often take a lot of this for granted.\n\n120\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.520\nYou go to the bank, you take cash out of\nthe bank, you get an ATM receipt right?\n\n121\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.820\nThat tells you the day and\n\n122\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.540\ntime down to the exact second that\nyou were standing at that location.\n\n123\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.180\nThere may be, and usually is,\na camera in those devices.\n\n124\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.790\nAnd we can record, and\nplay back that footage and say,\n\n125\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.000\nyeah at 12:02 Daniel was standing in\nfront of the ATM taking cash out, right?\n\n126\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.010\nAnd we know that.\n\n127\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.350\nAnd so we could figure that out.\n\n128\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.690\nWe can triangulate and locate your device.\n\n129\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.060\nA lot of the personal\ndevices we walk around with,\n\n130\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.620\ncell phones, things like that,\nthey have GPS location capabilities.\n\n131\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.860\nWe can actually figure out where you are,\nwithin maybe 100 feet depending on\n\n132\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.250\nthe kind of system we use, maybe even\nmore or less exactly where you are.\n\n133\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.100\nWe could triangulate you and\nwe can tell how long you've been there\n\n134\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.760\nby pinging the cell towers that you're\noperating from and triangulating you and\n\n135\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.400\nlocating you within that region or\nessentially,\n\n136\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.215\nthe triangle of the service operation\nas I make a triangle around my mouth.\n\n137\n00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.061\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can do that exactly\n\n138\n00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.140\nright, right about, I have no depth\nperception, I'm just horrible.\n\n139\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.830\nRight about there, right, and so\nyou could see that we could find and\n\n140\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.270\ntriangulate where you are.\n\n141\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.480\nSo, place and location of the incident,\ndate and time, evidence from volatile and\n\n142\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.490\nnonvolatile systems has to be gathered.\n\n143\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.850\nI talked a little bit about gathering\nvolatile evidence in one of the episodes\n\n144\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.810\nwe did earlier, where I showed you we\ncould use the ipconfig display dns\n\n145\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.110\ncommand, we can dump the information\ninto a file and write it off the system.\n\n146\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.850\nLet's just take a look at\nanother quick demonstration.\n\n147\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.540\nWe go to my machine here for\nanother second.\n\n148\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.420\nWe'll take a look at one\nmore example of this.\n\n149\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.830\nLet's open up another command prompt.\n\n150\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.326\nLook at the beautiful white and\nblue command prompt.\n\n151\n00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:55.618\nI love that background.\n\n152\n00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:56.348\n&gt;&gt; Very contrasting.\n\n153\n00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:59.340\n&gt;&gt; If I did blue and blue on blue,\nyou would see nothing.\n\n154\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.880\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n155\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.260\nit would just be like blue, right?\n\n156\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.484\nAll right, am I blue?\n\n157\n00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:03.392\n&gt;&gt; You could see blue.\n\n158\n00:07:03.392 --> 00:07:04.566\n&gt;&gt; I could see blue.\n\n159\n00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:05.648\nAlthough, if you're colorblind.\n\n160\n00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:06.634\n&gt;&gt; What if you're colorblind?\n\n161\n00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:07.894\n&gt;&gt; Then you may not be able to see blue.\n\n162\n00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.834\nAll right, so\nlet's just take a look at another one.\n\n163\n00:07:09.834 --> 00:07:11.001\nWe talked about ipconfig.\n\n164\n00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.720\nWhat about using ARP?\n\n165\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.470\nYou may be familiar with ARP,\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n166\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.320\nARP allows us, again,\nalways start with the help file.\n\n167\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.996\nAlways go in and say how do I\nunderstand what's in there, arp /?.\n\n168\n00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:27.350\nSo ARP allows us to take a look\nat IP to MAC address mappings.\n\n169\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.850\nNow is that going to be\nimportant forensically?\n\n170\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.560\nWell, it will tell us machines that we\nhave connected to or have connected to us.\n\n171\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.570\nAnd it may be valuable for\n\n172\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.450\nus to establish what machines have\nbeen interacting with us, right?\n\n173\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.520\nSo that would be probably\na good thing to know.\n\n174\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.205\nSo we may wanna take a look at this,\narp -a, lower case a there,\n\n175\n00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:45.500\nit says displays current ARP entries.\n\n176\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.805\nSo that might be something to do.\n\n177\n00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:51.689\nSo if we go in, and we do arp -a.\n\n178\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.150\nWe get our ARP table.\n\n179\n00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.156\nNow the ARP table has both dynamic and\nstatic entries.\n\n180\n00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.636\nDynamic entries\nare generated as we connect.\n\n181\n00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:01.504\nThat are gonna be there for\na period of time.\n\n182\n00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:05.300\nStatic entries are hard coded regardless\nof whether or not we destroy what's in\n\n183\n00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.520\nthe cache, restart the machine,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n184\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.440\nSo, we wanna understand that as\nwell because as an investigator,\n\n185\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.520\nwe have to understand that certain\ninformation will always be present in\n\n186\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.960\na system, although it may be modified and\nwe have to be aware of that,\n\n187\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.920\nother information may only be there for\na small period of time.\n\n188\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.400\nRight, so we have to know that as well.\n\n189\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.460\nWhat about the route command?\n\n190\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.310\nThis is another one that may actually\nbe helpful for us to be aware.\n\n191\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.880\nLet's just clear the screen.\n\n192\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.120\nSo the route command, right,\nhelps us to take a look at\n\n193\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.860\ninformation in the routing table\nthat's hard-coded in the machine.\n\n194\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.340\nAgain, we have a routing table that\nis created locally in our machine.\n\n195\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.510\nAnd normally it doesn't have\nmuch information in it.\n\n196\n00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.328\nBut we can statically add\nroutes to the routing table,\n\n197\n00:08:45.328 --> 00:08:48.330\nhard-coding or\npre-selecting what those routes will be.\n\n198\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.530\nAnd it will be helpful from\na forensic standpoint for\n\n199\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.580\nus to be aware of that because we may have\nhard-coded a path to a machine and that\n\n200\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.960\nmay have been something that the attacker\nhas used to compromise the machine.\n\n201\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960\nWe would wanna know that.\n\n202\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.710\nSo we can take a look at\nwhat's in the route table.\n\n203\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.940\nAnd notice that route minus f clears\nthe routing table of all gateway entries.\n\n204\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.890\nRoute minus p when you use with\nthe add command makes it persistent.\n\n205\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.290\nWe wanna read the help file and\nunderstand all this.\n\n206\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.360\nSo we go through and\nwe would take a look and\n\n207\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.100\nwe would do route print to be able to\nsee what's currently in the route table.\n\n208\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.080\nOf course we would spell\nprint the right away.\n\n209\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.720\nRount privets would not\nprobably give us much.\n\n210\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.920\nAnd so route print allows up\nto get all this information.\n\n211\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.300\nNow again, I'm looking at this\ninformation on the system in real time.\n\n212\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.540\nFrom a forensic standpoint,\nremember I have to pull this information\n\n213\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.350\nout of the machine and\nbe able to examine it.\n\n214\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.030\nNow, am I gonna be able to\ndo that live on the machine?\n\n215\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.260\nNo, not in real time.\n\n216\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.270\nAm I gonna make an image of\nthe machine capturing all the memory,\n\n217\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.230\nall the information, and then as we\nsaid forensically certify that image and\n\n218\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.320\nthen capture all this information?\n\n219\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.360\nI may do that,\n\n220\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.830\nI may have to take certain information\nout of the memory cuz it's dynamic and\n\n221\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.630\nit will be lost when the machine is shut\ndown in order to be able to do imaging.\n\n222\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.110\nSo we have to do this in\na variety of different ways.\n\n223\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.360\nWe have to think about this.\n\n224\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.310\nI may choose to do a route print, but\nthen I may output that as we said,\n\n225\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.460\nright, to an external device using\nsome sort of output statement,\n\n226\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.310\nthat outputs to a right block device,\nthat will allow me to throw the data out\n\n227\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.340\nof the system without allowing any\ndata coming back in to modify, right?\n\n228\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.030\nSo that would be something\nwe would consider doing and\n\n229\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.990\nyou know I could do something like that.\n\n230\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.500\nThis would not be the forensically\nsound way to do it.\n\n231\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.220\nBut if I used the device\ninstead of the local c drive,\n\n232\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.150\nthat was a right blocker as an external\ndevice that would now essentially\n\n233\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.260\nhave captured all the information\nin the routing table.\n\n234\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.110\nAnd I have evidence of the dynamic\ninformation that's there.\n\n235\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.360\nI go get copies of the host file,\nthe LMhost file,\n\n236\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.750\nI would look at the ARP cache,\nI'd look at the routing table,\n\n237\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.320\nI would look at the ipconfig\ndisplay DNS cache.\n\n238\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.380\nYou know I'd look at all\nthat information in memory.\n\n239\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.860\nWe have tools that actually capture all\nthe contents and memory in the system and\n\n240\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.260\ndumpits that we can actually\nlook at everything that's there.\n\n241\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.210\nAnd we wouldn't have to do this by\ngoing line by line, item by item.\n\n242\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.130\nI'm just breaking down and\n\n243\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.150\nshowing you in theory the kind of way we\nwould execute this, to give you a sense,\n\n244\n00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.070\nright, of the kind of things we may\nlook at to gather dynamic data.\n\n245\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.880\nRemember on something like cell phone,\nright, a smart device a mobile device,\n\n246\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.230\nwe're gonna have on those\nkinds of things and\n\n247\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.240\nwe're gonna have this information\nsitting in a cell phone.\n\n248\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.751\nOur cell phones have firewalls on them,\nprobably have AV running on them,\n\n249\n00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:22.851\nanti-virus right as opposed\nto audio visual, right?\n\n250\n00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:24.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well they will typically have,\n\n251\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.480\ncertainly not typically,\nwill have routing tables on them, right?\n\n252\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.950\nAny IP enabled device with an IP gateway\nhas a routing table associated with it.\n\n253\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.260\nCan have IP addresses, MAC addresses,\nthere is gonna be support for\n\n254\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.630\nthings like ARP, right, and all these\nkind of stuffs in the network stack.\n\n255\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.370\nAll this information exists on those\ndevices, although we probably don't have\n\n256\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.380\nan interface normally the way we do on a\nmachine like this, just go readily get it.\n\n257\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.470\nAre there ways for\nus to go in and do that?\n\n258\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.810\nAbsolutely, but we usually we use\nsoftware, mobile forensic software,\n\n259\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.290\nthat allows us to interrogate these\nsystems and gain access to this data.\n\n260\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.760\nAnd we'll take a look at some of that and\ntalk about how some of that works.\n\n261\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.300\nOxygen is a mobile forensics platform that\ncan be used to do this and we'll actually\n\n262\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.200\nplay around and take a look at what\nthat looks like in an upcoming episode.\n\n263\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.990\nDaniel's been kind enough to\nvolunteer his mobile device.\n\n264\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.290\nI told him we would probably\ndestroy it but he said Adam for\n\n265\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.270\nthe good of the show don't worry about it,\ntake it, I'll be happy to get a new one.\n\n266\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.120\nHe really just hates his device and wants\na new one, but we're gonna take a look.\n\n267\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.860\nWe're not gonna use his device,\nI'm only kidding.\n\n268\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.310\nBut we are gonna take a look at\nhow to install the software and\n\n269\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.880\nat least show you what\nthe interface looks like for\n\n270\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.740\nyou to be able to play around with that,\nso you'll be able to see that coming up.\n\n271\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.660\nThat will not be part five,\n\n272\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.540\nthat will be a whole separate thing\nlater on at some other point.\n\n273\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.820\nBut we want to make sure that we're\nfamiliar with this kind of stuff because\n\n274\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.070\nthis is exactly what we would need\nto be doing as an investigator,\n\n275\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.670\nas a CHFI to be able to gather this step.\n\n276\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.480\nWhat are some other places we may look for\ndata, for volatile data like this?\n\n277\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.600\nWe talked about certainly the caches.\n\n278\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Might there be swap files for\n\n279\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.120\ninstance, right?\n\n280\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Good place.\n&gt;&gt; Swap files will be, or\n\n281\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.190\nyou may call them swap files, you may call\nthem paging files, they're refered to by\n\n282\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.090\ndifferent names, but the temp caches\nare to be used by the drive to\n\n283\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.030\noffset memory on the local machine by\nphysically writing information there.\n\n284\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.160\nThose are wiped out when\nwe power down the machine.\n\n285\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.140\nWe've gotta capture that information\nin order to be able to see what's going\n\n286\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.750\non in there, right?\n\n287\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.540\nSo we're gonna need to do that as well.\n\n288\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.900\nSo these are the kinda things\nthat we wanna look for\n\n289\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.675\nbecause this is the kind of information\nthat actually will illustrate to us\n\n290\n00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:17.855\nwhat's going on in real\ntime behind the scenes.\n\n291\n00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:20.475\nAnd this is not always obvious,\nnot always easy for us to tell.\n\n292\n00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:23.985\nI can look at a machine, but I may\nnot really see what's going on there,\n\n293\n00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:25.655\nunless I drill in under\nthe covers a little bit.\n\n294\n00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:27.810\nAnd that's one of the things we gotta\nthink about and be concerned with.\n\n295\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.150\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n296\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.610\nSo I wanna look at some of these things.\n\n297\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.592\nLet's go back to my machine, I wanna\nshow you a place where you can go and\n\n298\n00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:35.880\nget a list, right,\nauthoritatively, more or less,\n\n299\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.906\nof what I should be\nthinking about collecting.\n\n300\n00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:40.860\nAnd how I know what it is\nthat I need to collect.\n\n301\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.020\nSo let's take a look.\n\n302\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.605\nGot a couple of websites up here,\nthat may be valuable for you.\n\n303\n00:13:44.605 --> 00:13:49.320\nCrimesceneinvestigator.net, CSI\ncollection, again,\n\n304\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.780\nDaniel will have this for\nyou, pretty cool site, right?\n\n305\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.390\nForget about the how do I\nbecome a CSI link up here.\n\n306\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.960\nBut if you take a look at this,\nunder evidence collection,\n\n307\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.360\nwhat we have are evidence\ncollection guidelines.\n\n308\n00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.520\nAnd we have all the different\nevidence collection manuals here.\n\n309\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.780\nThe handbook of forensic services from\nthe FBI, Laboratory users guide from\n\n310\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.830\nyour Alaska Scientific Crime\nDetection Laboratory, guidelines for\n\n311\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.920\nevidence submission from the Connecticut\nDepartment of Public Safety.\n\n312\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.113\nThere is a lot of different standards from\ndifferent places, something like the FBI\n\n313\n00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:20.335\nthe Handbook for Forensic Services\nis a standard world wide.\n\n314\n00:14:20.335 --> 00:14:24.340\nRight, this is not just hey we do in U.S,\nthe FBI's forensics\n\n315\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.590\nexpertise is recognized globally,\nand their Forensic Services Guide is\n\n316\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.040\nrecognized globally as\na reference point for everybody.\n\n317\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.190\nBut there's a lot of individual stuff\nfrom different states here that may be of\n\n318\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.491\ninterest to you just to look at.\n\n319\n00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.400\nTo be clear,\nnot suggesting you have to read any or\n\n320\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.020\nall of this stuff to prepare to\nbecome a CHFI and take the exam.\n\n321\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.080\nThis is really just real world information\nfor you, reference points for you.\n\n322\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.990\nThings that'll be helpful\nto get you started.\n\n323\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.630\nIf you really want to do this outside of\nan environment where you wanna go in and\n\n324\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.440\nlearn how to do it for\n\n325\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.480\nreal, these are the kinda things\nyou start reading and looking at.\n\n326\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.640\nEvidence collection bulletins that you can\nsubscribe to and take a look at again,\n\n327\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.050\na lot of them are here.\n\n328\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.560\nA lot of this stuff deals with forensics\nat a very broad level from a criminalistic\n\n329\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.940\nperspective, so you're gonna see\nthings about things like fiber and\n\n330\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.150\nhair or firearms,\ngunshot residual, paint evidence,\n\n331\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.430\nsexual assault, shoe and\ntire impressions, volatile flammables.\n\n332\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.950\nThese are all categories in the forensic\nsciences that deal with criminalistics\n\n333\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.680\nnot just digital forensics it's much\nbroader set of information here, but\n\n334\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.390\nthere is stuff about computers\nmixed in here as well.\n\n335\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.700\nRight, so you obviously wanna\njust go through and take a look.\n\n336\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.460\nVideo presentations on evidence\ncollection, kind of cool stuff.\n\n337\n00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.680\nCollection and preservation of evidence.\n\n338\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.860\nBest practices for seizing electronic\nevidence from the Secret Service.\n\n339\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.230\nSo again, recognized as kind of\nan authoritative leader in that area.\n\n340\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.830\nCrime scene equipment checklist,\npretty helpful.\n\n341\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.240\nPretty impressive, for us to be able\nto access that kind of information.\n\n342\n00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.300\nSo if we took a look at one of these,\nfor instance.\n\n343\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.540\nJust, crime scene equipment checklist.\n\n344\n00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.070\nJust go in and\ndrill down here for a second.\n\n345\n00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.667\nSo there's the biohazard bags.\n\n346\n00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.010\nWe talked about those, right?\n\n347\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.692\n[LAUGH] So you've got all\nthe different things listed here.\n\n348\n00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:04.155\nIt's just a little list.\n\n349\n00:16:04.155 --> 00:16:06.431\nKind of optional stuff,\nevidence collection kits.\n\n350\n00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:07.285\nWhat do you need?\n\n351\n00:16:07.285 --> 00:16:09.910\nAgain, this is not specific\njust to digital evidence.\n\n352\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.070\nThis is broad.\n\n353\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.915\nBut you can see the kind of\nstuff that's here, right?\n\n354\n00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:15.270\nAnd we talked about some of this and\nstuff you'd want to know.\n\n355\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.300\nSo this is one site that I think may\nbe valuable for you to take a look at.\n\n356\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.850\nSo I'd encourage you to think about it.\n\n357\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.510\nWhat are some examples of essentially\nevidence collection forms?\n\n358\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.570\nLike what does it look like?\n\n359\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.150\nWhen we go to collect evidence- Well\nwe know we gotta put stuff in a bag,\n\n360\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.200\nwe know there's enough doubt,\nwe talked about that.\n\n361\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.210\nBut how do we actually\nwrite the stuff down?\n\n362\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.620\nWhat does an evidence\ncollection form look like?\n\n363\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.620\nUsually helpful for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n364\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.570\nIt may look just like something\nright here for instance, right?\n\n365\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.110\nAnd so you can see- can we do\nfull screen for a minute, so\n\n366\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.030\nwe're just kind of out of the.\n\n367\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.990\nThere we go thank you,\nit's kind of hard to see part of that.\n\n368\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.710\nSo this is a standard\nevidence collection PDF.\n\n369\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.150\nYou'll see we have a case\ntracking number up here.\n\n370\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.590\nWe've got the type of crime, date and\ntime, report completed by fields, property\n\n371\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:02.260\nstatus, Is it evidence, recovered, stolen,\nfound, whatever the case may be, etc.\n\n372\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.470\nSo, we have all that.\n\n373\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.410\nDo we have, if known right,\nthe name of the sex, race, date of birth,\n\n374\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:14.260\nthings like that address, phone, victim,\nsuspect, item number, quantities.\n\n375\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.860\nSo tracking uniquely around all that,\nright.\n\n376\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.900\nSo we're gonna have all\nthat information there.\n\n377\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.988\nWe've got some stuff down here you know\nabout the examiner, the narrative,\n\n378\n00:17:21.988 --> 00:17:25.076\nthe notes like kind of you know a little\ndescription of what we're finding and\n\n379\n00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:25.906\nwhat we're doing.\n\n380\n00:17:25.906 --> 00:17:28.664\nThis is just one generic form\nits not the only way to do it,\n\n381\n00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:31.380\nthere's a lot of standardized\nforms you could look at.\n\n382\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.870\nGot another one here that is from the US\nmilitary so this is what a military\n\n383\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:42.590\nchain of custody form would look like,\nso property custody document.\n\n384\n00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.030\nSo in this case it's gonna\nlook a little different.\n\n385\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.620\nThey've got receiving activity,\nlocation, name, grade, and\n\n386\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.210\ntitle of person who\nyou're receiving it from.\n\n387\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.480\nSo, military, you're gonna follow\na little bit of different format.\n\n388\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.940\nSo we've got some stuff here\nthat you can look at, but\n\n389\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.430\nagain standard stuff item number quantity,\ndescription of articles.\n\n390\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.170\nBut then here's the stuff specific\nto chain of custody that we were\n\n391\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.780\ntalking about.\n\n392\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.555\nDaniel had mentioned this earlier, right?\n\n393\n00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:08.654\nItem number, date, released by,\nreceived by signature, name and grade,\n\n394\n00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:12.958\npurpose of change of custody has to be\ndocumented you'll see it here, right so.\n\n395\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.735\nAnd you see we've got a whole\nbunch of those, right?\n\n396\n00:18:14.735 --> 00:18:16.815\nBecause every time\nthe item changes hands or\n\n397\n00:18:16.815 --> 00:18:19.470\nis examined,\nsomebody's got to sign off for it.\n\n398\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.260\nSo we can see all that there and,\nobviously, track through that.\n\n399\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.800\nSo these are some examples, right,\n\n400\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.040\nof the different things that we may\nwant to insure we're aware of and\n\n401\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.320\ninsure that we understand how we can\ndo it and that they're formalized.\n\n402\n00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.310\nThere's a standard way of doing it.\n\n403\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.000\nAgain, just random examples, right?\n\n404\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.010\nJust went out on the web,\npulled them up and said,\n\n405\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.640\nhey, let me see what an example form looks\nlike and just brought one up to show you.\n\n406\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.300\nBut you can find these on your own, right.\n\n407\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.640\nThey're not hard to locate.\n\n408\n00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.680\nPoint is you wanna have a sense of these,\nand\n\n409\n00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.640\nyou wanna know that there's a set\nof standards that we follow.\n\n410\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.540\nWhen we think about what it is we're\ngonna do and how we're gonna do it,\n\n411\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:57.100\nwanna make sure that we're thinking about,\nhow do I collect information.\n\n412\n00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.860\nWe've talked about what we do and\nwhere we find it.\n\n413\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.660\nBut we're gonna,\nas you saw on the form, right,\n\n414\n00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.270\nlist all of the systems\ninvolved in the incident.\n\n415\n00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.710\nWe're gonna kind of document everything.\n\n416\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.180\nWe're gonna look for\nan order of volatility for each system.\n\n417\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.870\nWe talked about the concept of\ncertain information being dynamic,\n\n418\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.580\ncertain information being static.\n\n419\n00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.690\nWe'll talk more about\norder of volatility and\n\n420\n00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.730\nhow we go after that evidence in a way\nthat allows us to capture everything.\n\n421\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.870\nWe always look at the registers and\nthe caches and memory spaces first.\n\n422\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.410\nWe wind up finishing with stuff that,\non the far end, is static,\n\n423\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.260\nand not really gonna be subject\nto power down restrictions.\n\n424\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.630\nSo, file system files that are there,\nregardless of whether the system's turned\n\n425\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.380\non or off, are not as important to\ncapture, in the order of volatility,\n\n426\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.650\nas files in memory that are gonna away the\nminute we power off the machine, right?\n\n427\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.960\nSo, we wanna think about that.\n\n428\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.430\nWanna make sure we record the clock\ndrift Of any systems involved,\n\n429\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.150\nwe talked about time and\ndate stamps on the system.\n\n430\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.480\nCould we go back on to my machine for\na minute,\n\n431\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.030\nI'm gonna show you\nsomething with the clock.\n\n432\n00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.090\nI need you to go full screen, because\nthe clock is sitting behind me there and\n\n433\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.800\nyou won't be able to see it otherwise.\n\n434\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.790\nReally inconvenient that they put\nit in the lower right hand corner.\n\n435\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What are they thinking?\n\n436\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.480\nShould be up in the middle of the screen,\nwhere everybody looks normally, right?\n\n437\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.700\nSo you know, on every system,\n\n438\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.880\nevery computer system you'll see\nthat we have a system clock right?\n\n439\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.736\nAs you can see there,\nwe can bring it up by clicking.\n\n440\n00:20:06.736 --> 00:20:09.564\nAnd you know, you can see its got\nthe date, the time, et cetera,\n\n441\n00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:12.780\nis this thing subject to modification,\ncan we change that?\n\n442\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.344\nYeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n443\n00:20:13.344 --> 00:20:14.480\n&gt;&gt; You can totally change that, yeah.\n\n444\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Easily change that.\n\n445\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.350\nWould we know it's been changed?\n\n446\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.710\nYeah, maybe hard to know.\n\n447\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.960\nChange date and time settings,\nright there, right?\n\n448\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.650\nWouldn't be hard to do.\n\n449\n00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:26.500\nNow can we also bring up the date and\ntime from within the, whoops.\n\n450\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.725\nThat's not the right one.\n\n451\n00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:30.055\nCan we bring it up from,\nnever start with the top,\n\n452\n00:20:30.055 --> 00:20:31.185\nalways start with the bottom, right?\n\n453\n00:20:31.185 --> 00:20:33.685\nCan we bring it up from within\nthe command prompt as well?\n\n454\n00:20:33.685 --> 00:20:34.300\n&gt;&gt; I think you can.\n\n455\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how do we do that?\n\n456\n00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.541\nWhat would we do to get the system on-\n&gt;&gt; Is it time or\n\n457\n00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:38.091\n&gt;&gt; Is it time,\n\n458\n00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:39.632\nwell let's take a look, right?\n\n459\n00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:41.993\nIf we do time, and Daniel's right,\nwe can do time, but\n\n460\n00:20:41.993 --> 00:20:45.075\nnotice that we also can enter\nthe new time right there.\n\n461\n00:20:45.075 --> 00:20:46.775\nNow, can we modify system time?\n\n462\n00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:48.220\nObviously very easy to do.\n\n463\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.650\nBut if we are in an LDAP\ndomain environment,\n\n464\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.280\ntime may be controlled by group policy.\n\n465\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.360\nWe may not be able to modify the time\nlocally because it'll reset itself.\n\n466\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.170\nSo there's all these variables we\ngotta be aware of as an investigator\n\n467\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.370\nbased on the state of the machine, right.\n\n468\n00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.950\nAnd then based on that, we have to then\nlook for evidence of time being modified.\n\n469\n00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.790\nIf I modify time, how do I know\nthe time's been modified on the system?\n\n470\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.830\nWell one of the ways I could do that is\njust by comparing it to, standard time,\n\n471\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.340\nand say well look that's odd,\nthe system is two hours off.\n\n472\n00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.080\nBut, are we gonna find evidence\nof that time modification?\n\n473\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.240\nAbsolutely.\n\n474\n00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.610\nWe can go into the log files,\nessentially go into event viewer, or\n\n475\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.039\nthe equivalent on a system\nwherever we happen to be.\n\n476\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.930\nAnd if we go in, in Windows anyway,\nand we go into our system log,\n\n477\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.010\nright, we would see evidence of\nthis kind of stuff being modified.\n\n478\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.200\nI didn't modify time, so\nyou're not gonna see evidence of it,\n\n479\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.480\nbut we would see evidence of it in the log\nfiles if that activity took place.\n\n480\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.850\nDo we capture log files and\n\n481\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.390\nexamine them as part of\nforensically examining a system?\n\n482\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.980\nWe have to, absolutely,\nbecause this kind of stuff can happen.\n\n483\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.160\nCan somebody modify the system time,\n\n484\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.990\nengage in an activity to make it look\nlike it happened it earlier than it did,\n\n485\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.830\nand then modify the time\nback after the activity.\n\n486\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.220\nModifying as a result,\nthe time that the activity took place.\n\n487\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.400\nYeah, we do it all the time, we teach\nyou how to do it in hacking class,\n\n488\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.460\nit's not hard to do.\n\n489\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.170\nYou know one of the ways we can easily\nthrow the scent off, so to speak,\n\n490\n00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.620\nof investigators is hacking into a system,\nmodifying the system time,\n\n491\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.710\nengaging all those activities and leaving\na false trail on the log file showing you\n\n492\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.980\nwe did something at a different point and\ntime than we did.\n\n493\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.990\nAnd so as an investigator, we need to\nbe aware of this an understand this.\n\n494\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.650\nSo recording any clock drift that\nwe find becomes very important.\n\n495\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.840\nDocumenting all unique system identifiers.\n\n496\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.640\nHow do we document system identifiers?\n\n497\n00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.930\nWhat may be relevant and unique?\n\n498\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.541\nWell, one of the simplest\nways right just in here,\n\n499\n00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:33.451\nall right let's just leave that alone,\nwould be to understand, number one\n\n500\n00:22:35.853 --> 00:22:39.230\nIf I can type correctly,\nhostana, right host name, right?\n\n501\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.090\nWe just wanna see what the host\nname of the machine is.\n\n502\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.340\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n503\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.580\nWe also wanna understand not\njust what the host name is but\n\n504\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.830\nthe unique identifiers\nassociated with the machine.\n\n505\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.720\nIf it's again in a directory,\n\n506\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.330\nthere's gonna be a computer ID in\nthe directory that we wanna be aware of.\n\n507\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.990\nThat has a GUID, global unique ID,\n\n508\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.070\nthat references that machine\nuniquely within the LDAP directory.\n\n509\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.340\nWe'd have to go to the domain\ncontroller to extract that information.\n\n510\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.820\nBut we'd want to be aware of that.\n\n511\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.390\nWe'd want to know about any of the unique\ninformation that's gonna be found here.\n\n512\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.230\nNow I like to work from\nthe command line a lot.\n\n513\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.050\nBut can we do this graphically, as well?\n\n514\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.630\nCan we go back to the machine, please?\n\n515\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.020\nCan we do this graphically, as well?\n\n516\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.920\nWe could do this from within the machine,\nright?\n\n517\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.670\nWe don't have to go to the command\nline to find the machine name.\n\n518\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.340\nWe can go to the start menu, typically\nagain, in Windows, equivalent in Linux,\n\n519\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.490\nUnix and or the Apple platform,\nyou just have to know where to go.\n\n520\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.330\nUsually it's from a command line a lot\nof the times in those environments.\n\n521\n00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.320\nBut in Windows can I go to Computer?\n\n522\n00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.300\nCan I go to Properties of the computer?\n\n523\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.370\nCan I go here?\n\n524\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.180\nCan I look at information\nabout the licensing,\n\n525\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.480\ninformation here about computer name,\ndomain name and workgroup settings?\n\n526\n00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.290\nCan I see that?\n\n527\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.654\nSure I can, I can look for it right here.\n\n528\n00:23:40.654 --> 00:23:41.550\nLet me just move that over.\n\n529\n00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.470\nI didn't realize we were\ndoing the whole thing.\n\n530\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.320\nThere you weren't able to see.\n\n531\n00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.317\nCan I see it right there?\n\n532\n00:23:47.317 --> 00:23:48.730\nCan I change those settings?\n\n533\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.950\nI can change those settings.\n\n534\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.150\nWill I have a record of them?\n\n535\n00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:51.710\nAbsolutely.\n\n536\n00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.719\nI can get a record of them as well.\n\n537\n00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:56.528\nWe talked about documenting\nany system identifiers.\n\n538\n00:23:56.528 --> 00:23:58.764\nWhat about write protecting and\nvirus checking all media?\n\n539\n00:23:58.764 --> 00:24:00.225\nWe talked about this as well.\n\n540\n00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:03.392\nShould I be taking pictures of\nthis information in the screen?\n\n541\n00:24:03.392 --> 00:24:06.361\nSo, in other words, I have this up\non the screen right now, right?\n\n542\n00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:10.717\nShould I take a picture to represent\nthe current state of the machine, and\n\n543\n00:24:10.717 --> 00:24:13.105\nunderstand that whether it's this, or\n\n544\n00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:16.150\nwhether I just bring\nup the command prompt?\n\n545\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.570\nAnd I have the current time up.\n\n546\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.910\nI probably bring up the current time and\ndate, and then do it this way, and say,\n\n547\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.670\nyep, that's the machine name right there.\n\n548\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.217\nCould I do that to\nrepresent that I know that,\n\n549\n00:24:24.217 --> 00:24:26.050\nthat's the current state of the machine?\n\n550\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:26.930\nAbsolutely.\n\n551\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.650\nAm I modifying anything, impacting\nthe system negatively by doing this?\n\n552\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.420\nNo, these are non-destructive events.\n\n553\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.240\nI'm not modifying the system machine name\nby bringing it up in a command prompt.\n\n554\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.210\nI'm simply looking at it.\n\n555\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.650\nSo documenting it could be something\nas simple as bringing it up,\n\n556\n00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.000\ncapturing it and doing a picture.\n\n557\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.480\nBut keep in mind taking\na screen print on the machine\n\n558\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.050\nis not the same thing as taking\na picture from the outside.\n\n559\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.010\nWe'd have to take a picture from\nthe outside using a camera,\n\n560\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.780\nto authoritatively capture\nthe same information.\n\n561\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.250\nNow, your print screen what is it?\n\n562\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.290\nThe clip it, whatever it is?\n\n563\n00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.030\n&gt;&gt; The snipping tool.\n\n564\n00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that thing right.\n\n565\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.890\nBecause that's going to modify\nthe system and add file to it and\n\n566\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.450\nthat's not acceptable.\n\n567\n00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.880\nSo we can't capture it on the machine, we\nhave to capture it outside the machine but\n\n568\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.860\nwe have to know what's in the machine.\n\n569\n00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.680\nSo we got to be thinking about all this,\nright.\n\n570\n00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.440\nNow today, everybody walks\naround with a smart device,\n\n571\n00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.280\ntypically a phone that has a camera on it.\n\n572\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.260\nIs it easy for\npeople to record this stuff?\n\n573\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.980\nYeah, it's actually pretty easy today.\n\n574\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.100\nBut years ago,\nyou had to walk around with a camera,\n\n575\n00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.930\nand you had to actually\nbe prepared to do this.\n\n576\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.480\nToday, you pull our your camera,\nyou take a picture, it's no big deal.\n\n577\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.000\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n578\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.210\nWe talked about chain of custody.\n\n579\n00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.240\nI showed you what a chain\nof custody form looks like.\n\n580\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.390\nRemember, legal document demonstrating\nthe progression of evidence as it travels\n\n581\n00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.880\nfrom original evidence\nlocation to the laboratory.\n\n582\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.235\nAnd from the laboratory through the.\n\n583\n00:25:39.235 --> 00:25:43.585\nThrough the hands of investigators all the\nway either to the end of life, at trial,\n\n584\n00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:45.195\nand then return, or destruction.\n\n585\n00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:46.975\nThat is what chain of custody equals.\n\n586\n00:25:46.975 --> 00:25:48.785\nMake sure we understand that definition.\n\n587\n00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:51.305\nMake sure we understand\nthe importance of chain of custody.\n\n588\n00:25:51.305 --> 00:25:52.995\nVery, very critical for us.\n\n589\n00:25:52.995 --> 00:25:55.565\nWe talked about the,\nGolden Rule, so to speak.\n\n590\n00:25:55.565 --> 00:25:58.820\nNever ever, ever under any\ncircumstances use original evidence.\n\n591\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.080\nVery important for us to remember that.\n\n592\n00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.590\nWe talked about how to\nverify a system integrity.\n\n593\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.270\nThey mentioned integrity using hatrick.\n\n594\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.760\nI showed you demonstration on how\nto do that in our last episode.\n\n595\n00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.050\nWe talked about how it can recover lost or\ndeleted data on a high level.\n\n596\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.890\nI'm gonna actually do\na demonstration of that.\n\n597\n00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.240\nAnd in an upcoming episode, I'll show\nyou how to use several different ways or\n\n598\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.780\ntools or mechanisms to do that.\n\n599\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.770\nWe'll take a look at\na tool cover cover files.\n\n600\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.000\nI'll delete some files and\nI'll bring them back for you.\n\n601\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.780\nSo I've mentioned it,\n\n602\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.380\nwe're actually going to show you how to\ndo that in one of the upcoming episodes.\n\n603\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.430\nThat'll be kind of a cool demo.\n\n604\n00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.480\nI'll also actually make Daniel\ndisappear and we'll recover him\n\n605\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.460\nwe'll bring him back as well,\nits kind of a two for one when we do that.\n\n606\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.175\n&gt;&gt; That's a cool app.\n\n607\n00:26:35.175 --> 00:26:36.576\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a cool app.\n\n608\n00:26:36.576 --> 00:26:37.994\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n609\n00:26:37.994 --> 00:26:41.300\nSo, delete host and delete files and\nthen we can bring both back and\n\n610\n00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.850\nsee it and he's gone.\n\n611\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.370\nWe bring them both back at the same time.\n\n612\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:48.050\nSo we'll also talk about what we can see\nfrom a data analysis perspective and\n\n613\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.780\nwhat the data analyst is able to see.\n\n614\n00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.040\nWe'll talk a bit about this.\n\n615\n00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.020\nWe're going to talk about analyzing the\ncontent of the file after we forensically\n\n616\n00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.840\nhash it to ensure we\ncould see what's there.\n\n617\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.390\nWe'll drill more into that.\n\n618\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.320\nWe'll talk about timelines,\norder of relevance for data.\n\n619\n00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.320\nWe'll go through that stuff in some of\nthe upcoming episodes and conversations.\n\n620\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.140\nBut as I already mentioned, things like\nfile content, date and time of file\n\n621\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.790\ncreation, modification, some of the stuff\nwe just looked at in the log files.\n\n622\n00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.300\nThis kind of stuff becomes relevant\nto what we're doing as investigators.\n\n623\n00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.000\nAlso, assessment of evidence\nis very important as well.\n\n624\n00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.740\nWe've talked a little bit about this.\n\n625\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.000\nThe idea of reviewing file names for\nrelevancy and or patterns.\n\n626\n00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.090\nA lot of times, file names might be\nmodified to hide the true intent or\n\n627\n00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.940\nnature of what's going on in there.\n\n628\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.180\nWe gotta think about that.\n\n629\n00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.190\nBut a lot of times file names\nmight actually tell us something.\n\n630\n00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.640\nSecret Bank Records,\n\n631\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.720\nif that's the name of the file, maybe\nof interest to us as an investigator.\n\n632\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.490\nOr files that seems out of place,\nthat are not in the right location\n\n633\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.210\nCould we go back to my machine for\njust a second?\n\n634\n00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.900\nLet me just give you a thought\nprocess on this here.\n\n635\n00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.980\nI'm just going to minimize this.\n\n636\n00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:52.510\nSo let's say that we come in here to\nour Windows Explorer as you can see,\n\n637\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.880\nand we go to our e drive, it's just\nan empty drive there's nothing there.\n\n638\n00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.470\nAnd I, let's say just create\na file here real quickly.\n\n639\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:06.280\nAnd I call this right secret data.\n\n640\n00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:14.320\nAnd inside secret data I\nput a word document called.\n\n641\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.288\n&gt;&gt; Val Kilmer's address.\n\n642\n00:28:15.288 --> 00:28:19.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No I was gonna call it,\ndocument of doom.\n\n643\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:25.400\nAlright, and while that in and\nof itself is named in such a way and\n\n644\n00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.310\nis obviously you know,\nskewed in such a way we clearly\n\n645\n00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.470\nknow that's where we're manipulating\nthat to make it look obvious.\n\n646\n00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.900\nRight but think about this,\nif I take this Word document,\n\n647\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.400\nregardless of what it's called.\n\n648\n00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.588\nTaking it out of this\nfolder where clearly,\n\n649\n00:28:37.588 --> 00:28:41.088\nit's something of interest that we\nwant to pay attention to, right?\n\n650\n00:28:41.088 --> 00:28:43.867\nAnd instead,\nI'm moving over here to the C drive and\n\n651\n00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:46.468\nI just put it right here\nin the root of the C drive.\n\n652\n00:28:46.468 --> 00:28:50.204\nAnd let's see I change the name,because\nobviously calling it document is so\n\n653\n00:28:50.204 --> 00:28:51.131\nobvious, right?\n\n654\n00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:54.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Instead I call it something very\n\n655\n00:28:54.663 --> 00:28:58.290\ninnocuous,something like set up.\n\n656\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.100\nSet up right?\n\n657\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.520\nAnd I leave it there.\n\n658\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.540\nIs that going to raise\na lot of alarm bells?\n\n659\n00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.080\nProbably not, but\nlet's think about this for just a second.\n\n660\n00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.590\nHow often do you find a Word\ndocument sitting in the root of\n\n661\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.140\na C drive on a machine.\n\n662\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.900\n&gt;&gt; Not usually.\n\n663\n00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Not usually right?\n\n664\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.730\nWe would normally find text files, you see\na couple of text documents there that I've\n\n665\n00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.480\nbeen putting in for demonstrations.\n\n666\n00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.900\nWe find a lot of information,\nright, we find a lot of files.\n\n667\n00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.660\nBut we don't often find documents sitting\nright there in the root of the drive.\n\n668\n00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.005\nI mean, not natively,\nnot out of the box, not,\n\n669\n00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:31.095\nyou know normally unless\nsomebody's put them there.\n\n670\n00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:34.945\nMy point is, we have to be,\nwhen we're investigators looking at this,\n\n671\n00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:39.535\nwe have to be constantly with that kind\nof 360 degree radar, constantly looking\n\n672\n00:29:39.535 --> 00:29:43.565\nat everything around us and examining it\nand thinking to ourselves, is that normal?\n\n673\n00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:44.920\nWhat would I do, right?\n\n674\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n675\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.570\n&gt;&gt; If I went and\n\n676\n00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.110\nput a document there, why is it there?\n\n677\n00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.010\nAnd it may just be there for\na legitimate reason.\n\n678\n00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.800\nSetup may literally just be a document\nthat tells us how to set something up, or\n\n679\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.200\nwe just put it there because we\ndidn't have anywhere else to put it.\n\n680\n00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.170\nBut it could also be a document\nput there on purpose, and\n\n681\n00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.930\nleft there to hide\nsomething in plain sight.\n\n682\n00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.398\nAnd we've got to think about that,\nand be aware of that.\n\n683\n00:30:05.398 --> 00:30:06.560\nAwesome.\n&gt;&gt; That's the kind of thing we got\n\n684\n00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.260\nto start thinking about.\n\n685\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.900\nSo when we assess evidence,\nwe're looking for things like file names.\n\n686\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.150\nWe're looking at relevance and patterns.\n\n687\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.640\nHow many documents exist?\n\n688\n00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.330\nDo you know the number of text files\non a normal Windows system, on average?\n\n689\n00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.739\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't even begin\nto fathom a guess.\n\n690\n00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.210\nOkay, a lot.\n\n691\n00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.410\nI was expecting you to say something.\n\n692\n00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.820\nSo I had a moment to scratch my nose.\n\n693\n00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.700\nAnd you didn't do that,\n\n694\n00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.190\nso I'm just going to stand here\nwith an itchy nose while we talk.\n\n695\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.290\nSo actually, what the heck,\nI'll just scratch it right there.\n\n696\n00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Give it heck.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to live on\n\n697\n00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.330\nthe edge, right?\n\n698\n00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.530\nSo, all kidding aside, I was actually\nasking Dan a really serious question.\n\n699\n00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.270\nAnd you know, the answer he gave is the\nexact answer most people would give you.\n\n700\n00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.250\nI have no idea, right?\n\n701\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.860\nI don't know.\n\n702\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.610\nAnd by the way,\nI don't know the number either.\n\n703\n00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.530\nBut I know one really important thing.\n\n704\n00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.220\nI know that there is a quantifiable\nnumber for the number of text files.\n\n705\n00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.260\nAnd I know the majority of text files will\nlive in certain predetermined locations.\n\n706\n00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.820\nIf I start seeing a number that looks\nunusually high, and I start seeing text\n\n707\n00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.530\nfiles in random locations, like the root\nof the C drive where they don't normally\n\n708\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.600\nexist, I'm going to zero in on that and\nthat's gonna be of interest to me\n\n709\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.200\nbecause that evidence indicates that\nthere's something unusual going on.\n\n710\n00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.720\nOf file headers and file extensions,\ndo they match or mismatch?\n\n711\n00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.270\nIs the word document really\nset up as a .docx document or\n\n712\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.310\nis it set up as something else?\n\n713\n00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.050\nThe headers and metadata will tell us if\nthe file extension has been modified.\n\n714\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.080\nWe may change the word document and\nmake it look like something else.\n\n715\n00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.490\nCan you go back to my machine for\na minute?\n\n716\n00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:30.340\nSo let's say we take this Text file right\nhere called route.txt, let's modify that.\n\n717\n00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.780\nAnd let's go to the properties.\n\n718\n00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.910\nYou can see that it\nopens with text no path.\n\n719\n00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.060\nIt modifies or\nrather is a type of file.txt.\n\n720\n00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.000\nWhat if I go in and I change that?\n\n721\n00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.650\nAnd I put a .docx extension on the end.\n\n722\n00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.280\nBecomes a Word document, right?\n\n723\n00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.570\nAnd I can modify those files.\n\n724\n00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.050\nWhat if I take this, and\nI modify this, right?\n\n725\n00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.420\nI can go and say, hey, you know what?\n\n726\n00:31:53.420 --> 00:32:00.741\nInstead of opening with Word, right, let\nme change that and open it with WordPad.\n\n727\n00:32:00.741 --> 00:32:01.595\nAnd that changes the icon.\n\n728\n00:32:01.595 --> 00:32:03.172\nI know it's hard to see, right?\n\n729\n00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:04.226\nBut it changes the icon.\n\n730\n00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:06.009\nIt's still a Word document.\n\n731\n00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:08.933\nBut it changes the icon\nassociated with the document.\n\n732\n00:32:08.933 --> 00:32:12.850\nIt's no longer the Microsoft Office icon,\nit's the WordPad icon.\n\n733\n00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.860\nIt's really hard to see, it's kind of\nsmall but trust me, it's there, right?\n\n734\n00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.540\nAnd so my point is, could we hide a\ndocument by hiding it and hiding the type?\n\n735\n00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.090\nNow, can we go full screen because\nit's hard to see this otherwise.\n\n736\n00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:30.800\nSo, when you look now at the type here\nif I can just, Kinda get that to yeah.\n\n737\n00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.910\nSo, now, instead of being a Word document,\nit says,\n\n738\n00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.270\nOffice Open XML document because\nI changed the type, right?\n\n739\n00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.858\nSo now, it doesn't appear to be a Word\ndocument even though it is, right?\n\n740\n00:32:42.858 --> 00:32:45.382\nAnd If I go back and I modify it again,\n\n741\n00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:54.260\nIt changes back to\nMicrosoft Word document.\n\n742\n00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.580\nAnd so, modifying the properties of\nthe file and modifying the name and\n\n743\n00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.440\nhow it opens modifies the display and\nthe identifiers.\n\n744\n00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.630\nNow, there's evidence of that and\nI can track that.\n\n745\n00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.410\nBut the point is, if that's done, that may\nmodify my interpretation of the data and\n\n746\n00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.900\nI may not realize it for what it is.\n\n747\n00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.460\nHeader file information and\n\n748\n00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.070\nwe'll see how to extract this\nwith tools in another episode.\n\n749\n00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.210\nHeader information about the file\nwill actually explain to us and\n\n750\n00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.710\nshow us that the files\nare being manipulated,\n\n751\n00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.236\nand we can track that forensically and\nexamine that.\n\n752\n00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:24.915\nI'm showing you a very simple way of\ndoing it, I'm just saying hey look,\n\n753\n00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:27.670\nsleight of hand really quick, look at\nthe file type, I could see it change.\n\n754\n00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.870\nLook at the icon, and\nit may be that simple.\n\n755\n00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.680\nBut there may be more to it than that,\nand I may do that in a way that's not so\n\n756\n00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.439\nobvious, but this information will\nthen still be available to us.\n\n757\n00:33:35.439 --> 00:33:38.675\nReview date and time stamps in the file\nmetadata, we've talked about that.\n\n758\n00:33:38.675 --> 00:33:39.775\nCan we go back again, please?\n\n759\n00:33:39.775 --> 00:33:42.375\nI want to look at\nthe metadata on the file.\n\n760\n00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:43.475\nSo, let's go in here.\n\n761\n00:33:43.475 --> 00:33:44.705\nLet's open this up.\n\n762\n00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:47.325\nSo, we can hover and\nwe could see there's a little pop-up\n\n763\n00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:50.815\nthere with metadata that tells us,\ndate modification last time.\n\n764\n00:33:50.815 --> 00:33:52.470\nIt does tell us that right here as well.\n\n765\n00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.635\nBut this is Microsoft, and\nthis is Microsoft Word.\n\n766\n00:33:55.635 --> 00:33:59.720\nWe can go into the file itself,\nas well, and we can look at the file.\n\n767\n00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.338\nWe'll just wait for that to come\nup here and let me just do that,\n\n768\n00:34:05.338 --> 00:34:10.320\nget that out of the way,\nand let's go here to File.\n\n769\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.410\nAnd we can look over here\nunder Properties, and\n\n770\n00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:17.100\nwe can see metadata associated\nwith the file right here, right?\n\n771\n00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.850\nNow again, opening the file is going to\nmodify information, so we would never do\n\n772\n00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.020\nthis on the machine in real time\nuntil we've captured a copy of it.\n\n773\n00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.370\nBut the point is, we wanna make sure that\nwe understand that this data exists here.\n\n774\n00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.008\nCan we please go back to full screen?\n\n775\n00:34:30.008 --> 00:34:33.950\nWe want to see and understand that\nthis data exists here because this\n\n776\n00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.900\nis gonna tell us that\nthings have happened.\n\n777\n00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:40.220\nLike total editing time, like title, tags,\ncomments, last modified, who created,\n\n778\n00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220\nlast printed.\n\n779\n00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.770\nWhen it was created by who.\n\n780\n00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:47.770\nNow, can I go in and can I modify this\ndata and can I manipulate what's here?\n\n781\n00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.942\nAbsolutely, I can type a name in here,\nright, and I can add,\n\n782\n00:34:50.942 --> 00:34:52.286\nas an author, somebody.\n\n783\n00:34:57.716 --> 00:35:01.329\nAnd I could say okay, if Daniel's in\nthe address book I can add him, or\n\n784\n00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:04.500\nI could just make him a new contact and\nput him in there.\n\n785\n00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.981\nRight, no big deal,\nit's real simple to do.\n\n786\n00:35:05.981 --> 00:35:09.018\nI don't even need to have him as\na contact to add Daniel in as an author,\n\n787\n00:35:09.018 --> 00:35:09.700\nas you can see.\n\n788\n00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.100\nNow, I've gone ahead and\nadded Daniel into this document, right?\n\n789\n00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.703\nAnd essentially he's now\npart of the metadata.\n\n790\n00:35:16.703 --> 00:35:19.220\nI just save that, I just closed it.\n\n791\n00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.750\nIf I open it back up, and\nI go back and I take a look,\n\n792\n00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.720\nand I come in here, we'll see that\nDaniel's now down as an author.\n\n793\n00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.800\nNow forensically I may look at that and\ngo, well, who's the Daniel guy?\n\n794\n00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.520\nWhat's he got to do with this document?\n\n795\n00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.970\nAll of a sudden why is he in there?\n\n796\n00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.330\nAnd I may want to know that.\n\n797\n00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:39.280\nAnd the bad actor may know that, and may\nhave manipulated the file to throw me off,\n\n798\n00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.470\nit's hard to say for sure.\n\n799\n00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.826\nBut something as simple as\nthat could easily be done.\n\n800\n00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:46.144\nSo looking at date and time stamps to\nsee when the file was modified, right?\n\n801\n00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:49.836\nLast modified 12:20, right, created 12:18.\n\n802\n00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:53.280\nSo I know that after it was created,\nit was modified a few minutes later.\n\n803\n00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.170\nCorrelating that with that other\ninformation may help me to\n\n804\n00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.830\nunderstand that maybe that entry for\nDaniel is not accurate.\n\n805\n00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.260\nMaybe it's just something that's\nbeen designed to throw me off.\n\n806\n00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.775\nThis is the kind of stuff we have\nto start thinking about doing,\n\n807\n00:36:03.775 --> 00:36:05.120\ngotta become devious.\n\n808\n00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.082\nWe have to think and\n\n809\n00:36:06.082 --> 00:36:10.065\nput ourselves into the mindset of\nthe person that's perpetrating the crime.\n\n810\n00:36:10.065 --> 00:36:13.291\nBecause by doing that, we're then gonna be\nable to start to understand the kind of\n\n811\n00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:16.258\nthings they may have engaged in,\nkind of activities they would have done.\n\n812\n00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:18.625\nAnd as a result, look for\nevidence of those.\n\n813\n00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:20.940\nIt really is about understanding\nthe mindset of the attacker.\n\n814\n00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.046\nJust like we talked about\nin ethical hacking,\n\n815\n00:36:23.046 --> 00:36:25.646\nyou gotta think like a hacker\nto defend against hacking.\n\n816\n00:36:25.646 --> 00:36:29.400\nAnd this is really something you have to\ncarry forward into this conversation.\n\n817\n00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.070\nLooking at network logs and correlating\nnetwork log activity, and also scoping and\n\n818\n00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.120\ntailoring data for relevancy and impact.\n\n819\n00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.090\nFiltering and understanding the importance\nof data is also part of what we have to do\n\n820\n00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.890\nforensically as investigators to\nunderstand the relevancy of the data, and\n\n821\n00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.900\nto really carry out\nthe investigative process.\n\n822\n00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.462\n&gt;&gt; Well Adam,\n\n823\n00:36:45.462 --> 00:36:49.185\nyou've done a great job of reminding us\nthat when it comes to collecting data.\n\n824\n00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:51.800\nYou've got to remember, the devil\nis in the details a lot of times.\n\n825\n00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.640\nYou have to make sure that\nevery stone is unturned, right?\n\n826\n00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.734\nYou look under every rock.\n\n827\n00:36:55.734 --> 00:36:58.051\nYou pull up every stone-\n&gt;&gt; Every stone is unturned.\n\n828\n00:36:58.051 --> 00:36:58.821\n&gt;&gt; That's right, overturned.\n\n829\n00:36:58.821 --> 00:37:01.025\n&gt;&gt; Leave no stone unturned,\nis what you need to say.\n\n830\n00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:02.841\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes,\nthat is the correct way to say that.\n\n831\n00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:05.256\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; You wanna look for those details,\n\n832\n00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:09.644\nyou want to make sure that every attribute\nabout the data itself is cataloged,\n\n833\n00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:13.580\nfiltered, put in the correct areas,\nso that you like data together.\n\n834\n00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.629\nSo, you can try to start looking for\nconsistencies or\n\n835\n00:37:16.629 --> 00:37:18.473\neven irregularities, right?\n\n836\n00:37:18.473 --> 00:37:21.282\nThings and patterns will jump\nout to you that might lend\n\n837\n00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:24.520\nyou down to discovering what occurred,\nand correctly again,\n\n838\n00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.675\nthat search for\ntruth is always what we're going for.\n\n839\n00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:29.086\nAdam, a lot of information today,\n\n840\n00:37:29.086 --> 00:37:32.480\nso I know we've left our audience\nthere with a lot to chew on.\n\n841\n00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.140\nEven so much so that we've fully\nelapsed our time for this episode.\n\n842\n00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.220\nBut super great stuff and\nreally well done for us,\n\n843\n00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.830\nso that we can understand it as well.\n\n844\n00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.770\nGuys out there, we do thank you for\ndropping by, but\n\n845\n00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.150\nit does look like it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n846\n00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.285\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n847\n00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:50.331\nAnd he's the bad actor.\n\n848\n00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:51.157\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm the part four.\n\n849\n00:37:51.157 --> 00:37:52.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, we'll see next time.\n\n850\n00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:53.660\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you know what,\nwait, wait, I could do it.\n\n851\n00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.442\nLive long and prosper.\n\n852\n00:37:54.442 --> 00:37:55.425\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Can you do that?\n\n853\n00:37:55.425 --> 00:37:56.756\n&gt;&gt; I can, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n854\n00:37:56.756 --> 00:37:58.456\n&gt;&gt; Ultimate [INAUDIBLE] cool,\ndude, do it, do it.\n\n855\n00:37:58.456 --> 00:37:59.721\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, can you do it with this one?\n\n856\n00:37:59.721 --> 00:38:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Do it, [INAUDIBLE] no, no, no.\n\n857\n00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.397\nDo it, do it, give me your fingers.\n\n858\n00:38:01.397 --> 00:38:02.064\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Do it, here.\n\n859\n00:38:02.064 --> 00:38:04.032\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, here we go.\n\n860\n00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:04.696\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're out.\n\n861\n00:38:04.696 --> 00:38:05.383\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n862\n00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.181\n[LAUGH]\n\n863\n00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:13.125\n[MUSIC]\n\n864\n00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:15.916\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.411\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.662\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:17.783\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:22.450\nAnd in today's episode,\nit is more on our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.090\nBack in the studio is Will.\n\n9\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.764\nYeah, you guessed it.\n\n10\n00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:26.605\nIt's Adam Gordon, Adam, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:27.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back,\n\n12\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.860\nI was hoping to be outside.\n\n13\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.640\nBut I guess we're back inside so.\n\n14\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.148\n&gt;&gt; Just close your eyes.\n\n15\n00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Here we are, close my eyes and imagine.\n\n16\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.410\nIf I closed my eyes, I could talk.\n\n17\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.240\nYou could see they're closed.\n\n18\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.180\nI think you could see they're closed.\n\n19\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.190\nI don't know where I'm looking though.\n\n20\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.530\n&gt;&gt; Imagine looking-\n&gt;&gt; I could be looking at you.\n\n21\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.680\nCould be looking at the camera.\n\n22\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.280\nCould be looking over there,\nit's hard to say.\n\n23\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.790\nAnyway, I'll open my eyes so\nwe can actually see what's going on.\n\n24\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.656\nSo let's talk a little bit about how\nwe deal with search and seizure.\n\n25\n00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:52.473\nWe've been talking in prior episodes\nabout the concepts associated with\n\n26\n00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.860\ntaking a look at,\ninvestigating, what we do.\n\n27\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.829\nWe've talked about the methodology,\ntalked about the reasons and\n\n28\n00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.631\nthe necessity to understand whether or not\nwe're going to follow that methodology and\n\n29\n00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:04.365\nthe outcomes we can expect as a result.\n\n30\n00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:07.536\nWe've talked about the need to have\na warrant in certain situations, but\n\n31\n00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:10.260\nalso the fact that we may not need\na warrant to search in others.\n\n32\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.680\nSo we're gonna drill into\nthat a little bit more.\n\n33\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.962\nReally talk through some\nof the legalities and\n\n34\n00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:16.783\nthe logistics associated with search and\nseizure here.\n\n35\n00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:20.929\nIt's gonna be a bit of a romp through\nthe legal mine field as we say.\n\n36\n00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.710\nA little bit dry in some cases,\nwe're gonna talk about some case law.\n\n37\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.070\nTalk about some various things,\nreasonable expectation of privacy,\n\n38\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.196\nthings of that nature.\n\n39\n00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:32.910\nBut we'll do a little demo, break it up\na little bit, do a little show and tell.\n\n40\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.770\nDaniel said he may actually do a soft-shoe\nin front of the camera here if it\n\n41\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.030\ngets a little out of hand.\n\n42\n00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.320\nHe's been practicing his\nlittle dance moves here,\n\n43\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.110\nyou should have seen\nhim before we came on.\n\n44\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.058\nIt was-\n&gt;&gt; Don't threaten me with a good time.\n\n45\n00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:43.380\nI'll do it.\n\n46\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.331\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying.\n\n47\n00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:45.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You were pretty impressive.\n\n48\n00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:49.258\nYou may wanna share that with our\nviewing audience at some point.\n\n49\n00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:50.972\nSo, searching and\nseizing a computer with or\n\n50\n00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:54.130\nwithout a warrant, we've talked about\nsome of the do's and don'ts already, but\n\n51\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.863\nlet's drill a little\nmore deeply into this.\n\n52\n00:01:55.863 --> 00:01:58.350\nIt's actually really\nimportant material for\n\n53\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.217\nus as investigators to have\na sense of because again,\n\n54\n00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.934\nthe framework we always give out is we're\nstarting these conversations, US Centric,\n\n55\n00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:09.910\nUS Federal law rules of evidence,\nwhat do we do here in the United States?\n\n56\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.390\nHow does that work here?\n\n57\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.540\nThis may be different somewhere else,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.980\nThe rules that apply for\nwhether you need a warrant in France,\n\n59\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.990\nin Germany, in the UK, may be very\ndifferent from what they are here.\n\n60\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.710\nSo understand as you're watching this,\nas we're going through this, those of you\n\n61\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.330\nthat are not US centric, those of you\nthat are based in other countries.\n\n62\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.030\nYou'll always important feed\nof knowledge to this but\n\n63\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.800\ndrill into the local laws requirements and\nregulatory compliance concerns for\n\n64\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820\nyou as a cyber security professional,\nas a security professional,\n\n65\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.100\nas a forensic investigator\nin your geography.\n\n66\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.100\nMake sure you understand how to\nframe this conversation there and\n\n67\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.000\ntranslate it accordingly.\n\n68\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.440\nHaving said that, when we deal with\nsearching and seizing a computer, without\n\n69\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.340\na warrant, here in the US, what are some\nof the things we have to be aware of?\n\n70\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.490\nThe idea that the court has often upheld\nis the idea whether the government's\n\n71\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.680\nconduct violates a person's\nreasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n72\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.970\nAs I was stating just a minute ago,\n\n73\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.420\nwhat we call the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy REP for\n\n74\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.370\nthose of you that like acronyms,\nis the idea of me as an individual.\n\n75\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.660\nWhat do I assume?\n\n76\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.830\nWhat can I rely on as being\nmy expectation of privacy?\n\n77\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.690\nMy understanding of what it means to be\nable to have control over my environment,\n\n78\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.220\nand as a result, certain decisions\nI may make as an expectation, or\n\n79\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.140\nas a result of that.\n\n80\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.440\nSo, Daniel, if I say to you, what is\nyour reasonable expectation of privacy\n\n81\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.230\nwith regards to items in your backpack\nthat are sitting out of your desk?\n\n82\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.055\nRight now we're in you know\nthe ITProTV studio office complex her,\n\n83\n00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:41.867\nand an undisclosed location and\n\n84\n00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:46.115\nif I say to you hey you know if I go to\nyour desk right up there in your offices.\n\n85\n00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.549\nAnd I know you got your backpack hanging\non your chair out there, probably some\n\n86\n00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.250\nstuff in there that you may or may not\nwant other people to mess around with.\n\n87\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.580\nYou know, your wallet,\nyour phone, who knows what right?\n\n88\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.430\nDo you have a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy that nobody's gonna go in there\n\n89\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.520\nand mess around with your bag?\n\n90\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.891\n&gt;&gt; I do, it's private\n&gt;&gt; Given an understanding of course,\n\n91\n00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.677\nthat Mike is out there.\n\n92\n00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Mike is out there.\n\n93\n00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.540\n&gt;&gt; And you know, you never know with Mike.\n\n94\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Mike.\n&gt;&gt; He's always, he's just a character.\n\n95\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.093\nBut assuming we don't\nlet him get around and\n\n96\n00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:11.004\ngo fooling around out there what's\nyour expectation, what do you think?\n\n97\n00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:15.386\n&gt;&gt; My expectation is that that it is\nprivate property and that since it belongs\n\n98\n00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:19.486\nto me and no one else Then they have\nno right to go through it even though I\n\n99\n00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:24.210\nwork for itprotv, they still have no\nright to go though my personal effects.\n\n100\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.654\nThey can only go through anything that\nthey give me because they own that,\n\n101\n00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:29.945\nthey don't own my bagpack,\nmy bagpack is mine.\n\n102\n00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:33.785\nI have a reasonable right to assume\ntat no one can just rifle through it,\n\n103\n00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:37.113\nI would even think maybe I have\nlaw enforcement at that point,\n\n104\n00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:41.140\nunless they had some sort of\nprobable cause to go in my backpack.\n\n105\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.140\n&gt;&gt; So you know, it's interesting.\n\n106\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.250\nIt would depend, right?\n\n107\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.970\nAnd one of the things\nwe often talk about is,\n\n108\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.920\nwith regards to reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, what's public, what's private?\n\n109\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.830\nAs Daniel was trying to define for us.\n\n110\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.890\nAnd so, with regards to anything conducted\naround the work area with regards to\n\n111\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.810\ninformation and systems as Daniel\nimplied that are ITProTV property,\n\n112\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.330\nDaniel has no expectation of privacy other\nthan the expectation that the owner,\n\n113\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.390\nin this case ITProTV generically,\n\n114\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.190\nlet's just say, has rights to do with\nthat information what they will.\n\n115\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.940\nBut it's interesting,\n\n116\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.220\nthey don't necessarily, unless they've\nclearly stipulated, they being the owner.\n\n117\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.240\nThat they've clearly stipulated\nin a policy, in writing,\n\n118\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.090\nmade Daniel aware of it,\nor whoever our subject is,\n\n119\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.190\nin this case Daniel's volunteered\nto be our little test subject.\n\n120\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.560\nIf the company has published a policy,\nmade it clear as an expectation that\n\n121\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.500\nyou as an employee have to adhere to,\nthen there's no expectation of privacy.\n\n122\n00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.690\nSo, if you pick up a phone,\nuse a corporate phone,\n\n123\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.520\nwe could potentially be listening in,\nyou send an email on corporate computer,\n\n124\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.349\nwe could potentially have a record of it.\n\n125\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.620\nYou access a file, even though it may\nbe a personal file, and you print it.\n\n126\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.875\nWe have a right to see that because\nyou printed it on a company\n\n127\n00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:56.750\nlaptop/company LAN,\nLocal Area Network/company printer.\n\n128\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.817\nEven though it may be proprietary\npersonal information.\n\n129\n00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.750\nRecords like health records, financial\nrecords, whatever the case may be.\n\n130\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.640\nSo people don't always understand this and\ndon't always realize this,\n\n131\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.410\ndon't always think through\nthe logic of this.\n\n132\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.550\nThis is on corporate note,\ninformation in corporate on assistant.\n\n133\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.060\nHowever, Daniel also raises\nan equal valid point.\n\n134\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.000\nIt's my backpack, right?\n\n135\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.800\nIt's my stuff and theory.\n\n136\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.790\nIt maybe hanging on a corporate chair but\nit belongs to me.\n\n137\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.540\nIs there a border?\n\n138\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.760\nIs there a boundary that the corporate\nentity is not allowed to cross?\n\n139\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.450\nIf there is, what does that look like?\n\n140\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.657\nAnd the answer is, absolutely.\n\n141\n00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.550\nDaniel's right, it is personal property.\n\n142\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.200\nBut, here's the rub again,\nif the employer has made it clear\n\n143\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.150\nthat the expectation of privacy does or\ndoes not extend to certain things for\n\n144\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.760\ninstance and\nthis is an unusual circumstance.\n\n145\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.910\nBut if you have a locker that you\nare given by the employer, and\n\n146\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.240\nyou store your stuff in the locker but\n\n147\n00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.700\nthe employer controls the locker,\nyou don't have an expectation of privacy.\n\n148\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.320\nI can open the locker as investigative\nagent if I'm given the rights to\n\n149\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.340\nby the owner,\nessentially by the entity, ITProTV.\n\n150\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.856\nAnd anything I find in there while belongs\nto you, I have the right to search because\n\n151\n00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:14.614\nyou put it into a corporate own\nfacility or corporate own container.\n\n152\n00:07:14.614 --> 00:07:16.650\nIf its in your backpack\nhanging in the chair,\n\n153\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.550\nI don't have the rights to go through\nthat backpack because it belongs to you.\n\n154\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.660\nUnless I, as you said may have probable\ncause with the law enforcement agent,\n\n155\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.870\nprobable cause is not the same\nthing as having a warrant.\n\n156\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.470\nI can search without a warrant if I have\nprobable cause to think that there may be\n\n157\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.290\nsome reason that I need to go in there and\ntake a look at something.\n\n158\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.250\nWe'll talk more about this,\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n159\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.723\nBut I may not necessarily be able to open\nDaniel's backpack if I don't have probable\n\n160\n00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.495\ncause and/or if I'm not\na law enforcement agent and\n\n161\n00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:48.026\nDaniel specifically refuses me\nthe right to see what's in there.\n\n162\n00:07:48.026 --> 00:07:52.128\nNow as the employer, the employer has the\nright to tell you, hey, we think you're\n\n163\n00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:56.464\ndoing something, you're up to no good,\nand/or, you've either stolen something,\n\n164\n00:07:56.464 --> 00:08:00.292\nyou brought in a gun, you're not supposed\nto bring a gun into the work place.\n\n165\n00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.299\nWhatever the case is right,\nyou've violated a policy.\n\n166\n00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:05.077\nWe want you to open that backpack and\nshow us what's in there.\n\n167\n00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:08.250\nYou have the right to essentially\nsay hey sorry I'm not doing that.\n\n168\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.185\nThey have the right to say,\nguess what, thank you but\n\n169\n00:08:10.185 --> 00:08:11.780\nyou're not working here anymore, right?\n\n170\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.503\nYou're out of here.\n\n171\n00:08:12.503 --> 00:08:15.224\nSo there are boundaries,\nbut at the same time,\n\n172\n00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:18.670\nwe also have the ability as\nthe employer to push back.\n\n173\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.290\nAnd the employee or you know,\nthe two sides of the coin here,\n\n174\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.900\nhave to think through\nthe logic of where they stand.\n\n175\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.090\nDaniel's absolutely right,\n\n176\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.820\nhe has the right to essentially\nprotect his private property.\n\n177\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.757\nBut the employer has the right to then ask\nhim to show us what's there, if they have\n\n178\n00:08:32.757 --> 00:08:36.528\na reasonable expectation that Daniel has\ndone something to violate a policy or\n\n179\n00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:38.320\nto put somebody in jeopardy.\n\n180\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.520\nIf Daniel did bring a firearm into\nthe workplace against corporate policy,\n\n181\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.980\neven though we may have a right to open\ncarry, or may have a right to carry\n\n182\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.800\na concealed firearm, and you do in\nmany states in the United States.\n\n183\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.890\nIn all states you have the right to carry\na concealed weapon if you're licensed.\n\n184\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.740\nYou may or\nmay not be able to carry it openly, but\n\n185\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.931\nyou certainly have a right\nto carry a concealed weapon.\n\n186\n00:08:56.931 --> 00:09:00.750\nUnder certain circumstances,\nfollowing certain laws, things like that.\n\n187\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.440\nAssuming Daniel's done that legally, and\nhe hasn't snuck a weapon in, right, and\n\n188\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.690\nhe's not violating the law,\n\n189\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.740\nhe has no reason to show\nthem what's in the backpack.\n\n190\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.870\nBut because he's on corporate property,\n\n191\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.690\nthe corporate entity has the right to\nattach additional legislative constraints.\n\n192\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.494\nIn other words,\nessentially to say hey Daniel, guess what?\n\n193\n00:09:18.494 --> 00:09:20.566\nEven though you have a right\nto carry a concealed weapon,\n\n194\n00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.280\nwe don't want it on the property here.\n\n195\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.936\nBanks do this, schools do this,\npost offices do this as, well,\n\n196\n00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.800\nyou can understand why, right?\n\n197\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's the concept of going\n\n198\n00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:29.529\npostal, right?\n\n199\n00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the idea is there are very specific\n\n200\n00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:35.161\nrules that companies can put in\nplace on their property because they\n\n201\n00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.950\nown the rights to what is within\nthe property, it's their domain.\n\n202\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.700\nAs long as they publish those policies,\neverybody's aware of them,\n\n203\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.810\nthen they have the right to\nenforce them in a reasonable way.\n\n204\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.330\nDaniel may decide, hey you know what,\nI don't like that.\n\n205\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.580\nI'm licensed by the state, I have\nthe right to carry a concealed weapon,\n\n206\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.880\nand I'm gonna carry it into the workplace.\n\n207\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.870\nThe workplace says, sorry you're not.\n\n208\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.768\nWorkplace has a right to bar Daniel from\ncarrying that firearm into the workplace.\n\n209\n00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:04.770\nDaniel can not like it,\nDaniel can decide he's not happy with it.\n\n210\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:10.630\nBut Daniel cannot challenge that right\nof the employer by flouting that law or\n\n211\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.415\nthat, in this case,\nrequirement, that policy.\n\n212\n00:10:12.415 --> 00:10:16.164\nIn purposely carrying a firearm,\nhe is in violation of the policy and\n\n213\n00:10:16.164 --> 00:10:18.374\nthere may be issues and concerns there.\n\n214\n00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:20.885\nSo we have to always be\nthinking about this right?\n\n215\n00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:24.870\nAnd it's not always black and white,\nit's not always cut and dried if you will.\n\n216\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.800\n&gt;&gt; And they change.\n\n217\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.870\n&gt;&gt; And they can change.\n\n218\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Up to a few years ago you weren't,\nif a company decided, you know what?\n\n219\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.750\nWe're not gonna allow concealed carry on\nour property, not even in our parking lot.\n\n220\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.606\nThey did that, they could say you\ncan't bring your concealed weapon so\n\n221\n00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:40.556\nif it's in your car or something like\nthat, you can't bring it to work and\n\n222\n00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.188\nleave it in you car and then go into work.\n\n223\n00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:45.355\nUp to I think it was three or four years\nago, Florida, at least in Florida,\n\n224\n00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:47.317\nchanged the law and said,\nyou have the right,\n\n225\n00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:49.859\nyour car is your property even\nthough you're an employee.\n\n226\n00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:51.748\n&gt;&gt; You can't bring it into the building,\nbut you can bring in onto the property.\n\n227\n00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:53.730\n&gt;&gt; But you can bring in onto the property,\nyes you can.\n\n228\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.840\n&gt;&gt; So it does change, right?\n\n229\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.050\nAnd so it is, again,\nit is variable, right?\n\n230\n00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.480\nWe have to constantly keep up with this,\nthink about this.\n\n231\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.244\nI'm not suggesting,\n\n232\n00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.624\nand this is [LAUGH] not a course on\nconcealed weapons [LAUGH] law, right?\n\n233\n00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:04.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n234\n00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.160\n&gt;&gt; I don't want you to think that's\nwhat we're here to talk about.\n\n235\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.330\nWe're just using it as one example.\n\n236\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.005\nBut it's an example that many people\nunderstand and have a sense of.\n\n237\n00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:13.755\nBecause a lot of us, although it\nmay not have been around a firearm,\n\n238\n00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:18.125\nhave had these kind of conversations in\nthe workplace with regards to things like,\n\n239\n00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.165\nhey I wanna see what you're doing?\n\n240\n00:11:19.165 --> 00:11:20.515\nWell no you don't,\nyou don't have a right to.\n\n241\n00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:21.565\nWell I may, right?\n\n242\n00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:25.375\nAnd that's something that as\nan investigator we have to think about.\n\n243\n00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:28.270\nWe may be the person who has\nto have that conversation.\n\n244\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.670\nWe may be the person who has to sit\ndown with somebody and say hey,\n\n245\n00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.308\nwe need to look at what's going on here.\n\n246\n00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:36.630\nWhat's the policies in place\nin the workplace currently, so\n\n247\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.070\nwe understand how to approach this\nconversation and we understand what your\n\n248\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.570\nexpectation of privacy is with\nregards to your employees, right.\n\n249\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.650\nWhat you've set up\nessentially as the employer.\n\n250\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.192\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a more relevant allusion to\nthis is, I worked at a company, Don and\n\n251\n00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:52.287\nI we both worked there together.\n\n252\n00:11:52.287 --> 00:11:53.260\n&gt;&gt; Florida Farm Bureau?\n\n253\n00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.202\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the Florida Farm Bureau.\n\n254\n00:11:55.202 --> 00:11:59.150\nThere was one of the managers\nthere was thinking that his\n\n255\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.610\ncomputer was being spied on.\n\n256\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.500\nWe had VNC installed on all the computers.\n\n257\n00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.185\nHe couldn't prove it.\n\n258\n00:12:04.185 --> 00:12:04.750\nHe didn't know.\n\n259\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.290\nHe's like, well, I'm pretty sure every\nnow and then I see the mouse move.\n\n260\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.810\nSo he had Don check it out.\n\n261\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.870\nAnd he did.\nHe found out that somebody had found the\n\n262\n00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.923\ncredentials to log in and was monitoring\n&gt;&gt; So not IT?\n\n263\n00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:15.561\n&gt;&gt; Not IT.\n\n264\n00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:17.114\n&gt;&gt; It was somebody else.\n&gt;&gt; It was somebody else in another\n\n265\n00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:20.040\ndepartment was monitoring\na manager's computer.\n\n266\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.130\nAnd, you know, we had to say that's bad.\n\n267\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.110\n[SOUND] Don't do that.\n\n268\n00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.190\n&gt;&gt; And, but\nwe had to gather the information,\n\n269\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.450\nfigure out where it was coming from,\nfollow the investigative procedure and\n\n270\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.360\nfind out where this happened.\n\n271\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.000\nAnd, they had the right to do that\nbecause it was a Farm Bureau computer,\n\n272\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.210\ndone in a Farm Bureau building,\nand it's their stuff.\n\n273\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nyou have the right to do that.\n\n274\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.280\nSo that's, it's a very important concept.\n\n275\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.350\nSo when we think about the government's\nconduct not violating \u007freasonable\n\n276\n00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.710\nexpectation of privacy, this allows us to\nconstitute a search without a warrant,\n\n277\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.780\nbecause as long as we don't violate\nthat reasonable expectation of privacy,\n\n278\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.010\nwe don't need a warrant in order to be\nable to serve and to do the search.\n\n279\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.740\nWe're not constituting what's\ncalled a Fourth Amendment search,\n\n280\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.580\nspecifically is how you often\nhear people refer to this.\n\n281\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.220\nAnd a Fourth Amendment search, if it's\ndone violating an expectation of privacy,\n\n282\n00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.140\nrequires a warrant, at least in\nthe United States currently under\n\n283\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.640\nthe current expectation and\ninterpretation of laws.\n\n284\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.260\nBut according to Katz\nversus the United States,\n\n285\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.420\nthe case that actually set this\nprecedent up, the government's conduct,\n\n286\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.855\nif it doesn't violate this reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, does\n\n287\n00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:27.335\nnot constitute a Fourth Amendment search\nand therefore no warrant is required.\n\n288\n00:13:27.335 --> 00:13:28.515\nWe can simply search.\n\n289\n00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:31.360\nSo we wanna understand that,\nKatz versus US.\n\n290\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.515\nKind of an older case but\none you wanna be aware of.\n\n291\n00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:35.545\nReasonable expectation\nof privacy as we said.\n\n292\n00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:39.015\nWith regards to general concepts,\n\n293\n00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:42.165\nmaybe a little different than with\nregards to computing devices.\n\n294\n00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:45.050\nSo with regards to a computer\nas a storage device,\n\n295\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.760\nis it under the direct control of\nthe individual or the owner, right?\n\n296\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.101\nSo we just talked about this, you kind of\nbrought this up, the whole idea, right?\n\n297\n00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:54.607\nIf it's my computer, and I'm using it and\nthen I give it to Daniel and\n\n298\n00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:57.100\nsay hey Daniel,\nyou need to do something for me.\n\n299\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100\nI'm gonna run out for a couple of minutes.\n\n300\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.547\nCan you sit down at my machine and\ntake care of this?\n\n301\n00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.984\nI've essentially transferred control\nof the machine to Daniel for\n\n302\n00:14:02.984 --> 00:14:04.075\nthat period of time.\n\n303\n00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:06.039\nIf Daniel then gets asked by Mike or\n\n304\n00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:09.240\nanybody, hey,\ncan we take a look what's on there?\n\n305\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.630\nIf Daniel says yes,\nthat's essentially giving authority for\n\n306\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.060\na search to take place because\nit's under the direct control\n\n307\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.662\nof somebody who's been\nauthorized to use it.\n\n308\n00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:19.900\nAnd so, this now becomes a problem.\n\n309\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.770\nCourts have to deal with\nthese kinds of things.\n\n310\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.640\nSo do we.\n\n311\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.600\nCourts have interpreted\nthe Fourth Amendment to apply to computers\n\n312\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.590\nas what we call a closed container.\n\n313\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.800\nMeaning it has to be\nopened up to be searched.\n\n314\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.370\nYou gotta open it up,\ngo inside and look for files.\n\n315\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.730\nYou can't just sit down, right.\n\n316\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.690\nAnd as a result, when we look for\ninformation, it's seen and described\n\n317\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.400\nunder the law as essentially opening\nup the computer, opening the container.\n\n318\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.300\nThink of a briefcase.\n\n319\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.000\nIt's probably the best\nway of thinking about it.\n\n320\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.322\nWhen you see a briefcase that's closed and\nlocked,\n\n321\n00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:51.140\nyou can't just go open it without\nthe permission of the owner.\n\n322\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.740\nYou have to get the right to do so\nbecause the owner has to let you do that.\n\n323\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.820\nIt's a closed container.\n\n324\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.510\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n\n325\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.193\n&gt;&gt; You do, you should.\n\n326\n00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:58.389\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well, from now on.\n\n327\n00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:59.378\n&gt;&gt; Now I know, now I know.\n&gt;&gt; You should,\n\n328\n00:14:59.378 --> 00:14:59.976\nyeah,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:01.221\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Mike mentioned that before,\n\n330\n00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.250\nhe said what the hell is\nDaniel doing in my backpack.\n\n331\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.426\nBut I said, I don't know,\nhe has a thing for backpacks.\n\n332\n00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what the story is.\n\n333\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.350\nSo it's considered to\nbe a closed container.\n\n334\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.660\nYou gotta get the right\nfrom the owner to open it.\n\n335\n00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.290\nBut as I said,\n\n336\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:18.885\nthe right of the usage may imply\nthe ability to grant rights to a search.\n\n337\n00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:22.220\nSo we gotta be careful about what\nwe do and who we let do stuff.\n\n338\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.306\nBecause depending on the timing, somebody\nmay be able to give somebody rights to\n\n339\n00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:29.432\nsearch a closed container,\nessentially open up a computer,\n\n340\n00:15:29.432 --> 00:15:33.297\neven though they may not necessarily\nbe the person that owns that computer.\n\n341\n00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:35.180\nAnd that's something else\nwe have to think about.\n\n342\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.003\nSo, reasonable expectation of\nprivacy with regards to computers\n\n343\n00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:45.095\nthat are underneath or under the control\nof a third party, as we said.\n\n344\n00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:47.768\nDaniel sits down at my machine,\nhe's now using it.\n\n345\n00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:52.101\nAccording to the courts, individuals, like\nmyself if I was the owner, may lose our\n\n346\n00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:56.557\nFourth Amendment protections, our Fourth\nAmendments rights to secure our machine,\n\n347\n00:15:56.557 --> 00:15:59.135\nif we give it to a third party,\nand let them use it.\n\n348\n00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:03.442\nThey, the third party, may now have\nthe right to essentially grant or\n\n349\n00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:05.856\ndeny access based on a search request.\n\n350\n00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:10.370\nThis comes into play when we're in the\ncloud, think about cloud computing, right?\n\n351\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.660\nThink about the fact that we\nessentially put our information\n\n352\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.690\ninto a third party system.\n\n353\n00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.200\nWe are giving the third party owner of\nthat system, essentially the cloud service\n\n354\n00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.020\nprovider, the right to oversee\nthat information on our behalf.\n\n355\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.604\nWe are the data owner as the customer,\nthey are the data custodian.\n\n356\n00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:33.323\nIf we think about the logic of how we set\nthis up and the traditional terms we use,\n\n357\n00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:37.059\nownership implies right to\ndecide dissemination and access,\n\n358\n00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:41.572\ncustodianship implies day-to-day,\nmoment-to-moment oversight and\n\n359\n00:16:41.572 --> 00:16:43.703\nexecution of ownership requests.\n\n360\n00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:47.047\nBut because the data resides\nin the physical systems of\n\n361\n00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:51.989\nthe data center of the cloud provider,\nthey are, when we go to do e-discovery,\n\n362\n00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:54.388\nwhen we go to essentially see systems,\n\n363\n00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:59.113\nthey are seen as having the ability to\ngive rights to be able to investigate and\n\n364\n00:16:59.113 --> 00:17:04.010\nrights to audit and rights to interact\nwith that data in the eyes of the law.\n\n365\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.030\nSo when we serve an e-discovery\norder to seize data in the cloud,\n\n366\n00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.780\nwe serve it at the provider's data center.\n\n367\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.060\nWe don't serve the customer.\n\n368\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.180\nWe serve the provider because\nthe provider has physical access and\n\n369\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.390\ncontrol of the data, and they maintain it.\n\n370\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.360\nAnd as a result, that's where we show up.\n\n371\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.930\n&gt;&gt; And we talked about this a little\nbit in our cloud security show.\n\n372\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.576\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n373\n00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:27.340\nit gets really funky when you start\ncrossing borders into different countries,\n\n374\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.958\nit gets really fun, doesn't it?\n\n375\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:33.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and because data, it's not even\nso much okay, hey I was here in the US and\n\n376\n00:17:33.217 --> 00:17:36.651\nnow my data is physically been\nmoved over to, let's say the EU,\n\n377\n00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:38.071\nsomewhere in EU, right?\n\n378\n00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:40.775\nIf we're talking about Microsoft it's\nin Ireland in their data center, for\n\n379\n00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:41.730\ninstance, right?\n\n380\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.550\nOr Google who has data centers in Europe,\nor Amazon, or whatever.\n\n381\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.260\nRight, yeah that's one thing, cuz now\nat least we have a physical location.\n\n382\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.260\nBut what about data in transit on\nthe wire, that moves between different\n\n383\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.640\ngeographies across different countries,\nin the blink of an eye like that.\n\n384\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.650\nIf we interdict that data,\nlet's say in Germany,\n\n385\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:07.005\nversus interdicting it in the US on\nthe American side of the cable, right?\n\n386\n00:18:07.005 --> 00:18:09.400\nAs opposed to going over to the other\nside of the transatlantic cable.\n\n387\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.420\nIf interdict that data in the US,\n\n388\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.380\nthat data is subject to\nUS jurisdiction and law.\n\n389\n00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.305\nIf we interdict, if we grab that data and\nseize it, in anywhere in the EU,\n\n390\n00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:22.100\nin any of the member countries,\nit's subject to EU jurisdiction in law.\n\n391\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.310\nSo it could actually be really a question\nof timing more than anything else.\n\n392\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.960\nForget about where it's\nphysically resident,\n\n393\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.040\nI'm talking about if it's on the wire,\nbeing transmitted in realtime and we\n\n394\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.740\nseize that data off the wire, then it may\nbe subject to another set of distinctions.\n\n395\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.660\nSo there's all these variables that\napply as we are investigating this.\n\n396\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.870\nWhen we talk about private searches,\nright?\n\n397\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.953\nWe've been talking about law enforcement\ndoing the searching up until now.\n\n398\n00:18:44.953 --> 00:18:46.508\nWhat about a private individual?\n\n399\n00:18:46.508 --> 00:18:50.075\nAs I've often said, if I'm acting\nnot on behalf of law enforcement,\n\n400\n00:18:50.075 --> 00:18:53.770\nrather on behalf of myself or\na customer, whatever the case may be.\n\n401\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.864\nFourth Amendment does not apply.\n\n402\n00:18:55.864 --> 00:18:59.064\nFourth Amendment does not apply to\nsearches conducted by a private party not\n\n403\n00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:01.800\nacting as an agent of the government,\nas I've said before.\n\n404\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.330\nMeaning we're not bound by the same rules,\nby the same laws.\n\n405\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.298\nI don't need a search warrant.\n\n406\n00:19:05.298 --> 00:19:07.520\nI couldn't get one even if I wanted one,\nright?\n\n407\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.340\nIf I wanna go search Daniel's bag as a\nprivate individual, if he's not around and\n\n408\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.560\nI go search it.\n\n409\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.920\nI may or may not have broken his\nconfidence, broken a law, broken a policy.\n\n410\n00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.100\nBut I don't need a warrant to go\nsnoop around in his bag if I want to.\n\n411\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.632\n&gt;&gt; Right, and.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not acting as an agent of the law\n\n412\n00:19:22.632 --> 00:19:23.230\nenforcement.\n\n413\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.156\n&gt;&gt; And any evidence you found would be\nadmissible because you're not acting as\n\n414\n00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:27.261\na law enforcement officer.\n\n415\n00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:28.610\n&gt;&gt; It may or may not be admissible.\n\n416\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.680\nThere's a gray area.\n\n417\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.091\n&gt;&gt; There's a gray?\n&gt;&gt; So in other words, yeah,\n\n418\n00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:33.461\ntechnically I have the right\nto go open your bag, right?\n\n419\n00:19:33.461 --> 00:19:35.150\nI'm not gonna argue with you about that,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n420\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.784\nBut the issue now becomes,\ndid I do so with the intent, right,\n\n421\n00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:44.871\nto essentially look for\nevidence without any idea of what's there.\n\n422\n00:19:44.871 --> 00:19:47.084\nTo go on a fishing expedition,\nin other words, right?\n\n423\n00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:51.571\nHey, I have a thing for Daniel, I'm out to\nget him right, and I wanna go in there and\n\n424\n00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:53.190\nmaybe I planted evidence.\n\n425\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.150\nMaybe it's not even that you had anything,\nmaybe I went in there to make it look like\n\n426\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.116\nyou were doing something\nyou weren't supposed to do.\n\n427\n00:19:58.116 --> 00:19:58.840\nIn other words,\n\n428\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.200\nthe courts are not just gonna say,\nhey, cuz Adam's a nice guy, right.\n\n429\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.890\nAnd cuz he drinks a lot of coffee so\nwe can trust him.\n\n430\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.370\nRight, we had this conversation, right.\n\n431\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.420\nYou gotta drink coffee to be trustworthy,\nright, so you drink a lot of coffee,\n\n432\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.360\nyou're trustworthy.\n\n433\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.720\nSo, as a result, we're gonna trust him,\nwe're gonna let him\n\n434\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.260\ntell us what's in Daniel's bag, even\nthough we have no idea what's there and\n\n435\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.165\nno idea whether or\nnot we should even look at Daniel.\n\n436\n00:20:19.165 --> 00:20:22.630\nDaniel's probably not doing anything\nwrong, he's not up to no good,\n\n437\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.750\nhe's standing here with me for\n\n438\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.570\nthe whole day, how can he possibly be out\nthere doing anything and up to no good?\n\n439\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.045\nBut if I set him up and I put something\nin there when he wasn't looking, and\n\n440\n00:20:31.045 --> 00:20:34.239\nthen we send someone else to go\ncheck what's there and they find it,\n\n441\n00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:36.053\nit looks like Daniel was up to no good.\n\n442\n00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:39.829\nSo, we don't just take the word of\nsomebody who's acting outside law\n\n443\n00:20:39.829 --> 00:20:42.390\nenforcement, on their\nown as a private agent,\n\n444\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.092\nas gospel because they could\nalso be up to no good.\n\n445\n00:20:45.092 --> 00:20:50.210\nBut we give them more latitude, right, so\nthere still has to be a burden of proof.\n\n446\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.350\nThere still has to be some sort of.\n\n447\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.010\n&gt;&gt; Some justification.\n\n448\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.970\n&gt;&gt; Justification.\n\n449\n00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.905\nWe would have to go to the owner\nof the building and say look,\n\n450\n00:20:55.905 --> 00:20:59.389\nwe think there's an issue,\nwe need to take a look at what's going on.\n\n451\n00:20:59.389 --> 00:21:01.249\nWhat's the policy,\nas I came back to earlier,\n\n452\n00:21:01.249 --> 00:21:03.190\nor what's the expectation of privacy?\n\n453\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.520\nDoes Daniel have\nan expectation of privacy,\n\n454\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.180\ncuz his bag is hanging on a chair\nin your office, or does he not?\n\n455\n00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.890\nCan I go out and search your car?\n\n456\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.940\nRight?\nNo I can't.\n\n457\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.566\nNot without justifiable cause, and not\nwithout a law enforcement official being\n\n458\n00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:18.417\npresent, because I would need\na warrant to be able to go do that.\n\n459\n00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:22.028\nAnd/or I'd have to have a law\nenforcement officer show up and say hey,\n\n460\n00:21:22.028 --> 00:21:24.915\nI think this is going on,\nDaniel was acting suspicious,\n\n461\n00:21:24.915 --> 00:21:28.450\nsaw him put something that looked\nlike a body in a carpet in the trunk.\n\n462\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we need to check that out.\n\n463\n00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.090\nAnd a law enforcement officer can show\nup without a warrant, ask you questions,\n\n464\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.840\ndepending on those answers and some other\nthings that are going on, they may say,\n\n465\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.500\nyou know what, I have justifiable cause.\n\n466\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.670\nI have reason to believe that\nyou have something in the trunk\n\n467\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.840\nthat we need to look at.\n\n468\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.630\nAre you gonna open that trunk for\nme, yes or no?\n\n469\n00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.516\nYou have the right to refuse by the way,\nbut they have the right to either then\n\n470\n00:21:51.516 --> 00:21:55.486\ndecide to open that trunk immediately,\nor at a minimum not allow you to move.\n\n471\n00:21:55.486 --> 00:21:56.540\nNot allow you to touch the car.\n\n472\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.530\nNot allow you to do anything until\nsomebody shows up with a warrant\n\n473\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.280\ngiving them the right\nto go into the trunk.\n\n474\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.410\nIt depends on what we call\nexigent circumstance.\n\n475\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.770\nWhether or\nnot you are going to destroy evidence,\n\n476\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.480\nas I mentioned in a prior show,\nas a result of waiting.\n\n477\n00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.050\nThe law enforcement officers show up and\nsay, hey you know what?\n\n478\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.690\nDaniel's about to drive off.\n\n479\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.390\nWe could stop you from driving off and\nkeep you there.\n\n480\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.830\nBut we may not open the trunk because\nwe may not have a right to do so.\n\n481\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.365\nCuz it's not in plain view.\n\n482\n00:22:21.365 --> 00:22:23.130\nWe talked about\nthe doctrine of plain view.\n\n483\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.020\nIf they see a body part sitting\non the seat of the car and\n\n484\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.790\nthey wanna know where the rest of it is,\n\n485\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.320\nthey have a right at that point to go\nsearch your car without a warrant.\n\n486\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.040\nBut if everything looks comfortable and\njust cozy in the car, there's no issue,\n\n487\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.980\nthey don't have a right to just\nopen your trunk automatically.\n\n488\n00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.230\nWhat they do, though, is they have\na right to say, hey you can't leave.\n\n489\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.620\nWe wanna see what's in there.\n\n490\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.620\nWe've sent somebody to go get a warrant\nand you're gonna have to sit here.\n\n491\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.969\nThey have right to,\nessentially to detain you.\n\n492\n00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:47.961\n&gt;&gt; Detain you, yeah.\n\n493\n00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:52.000\n&gt;&gt; And prevent you from doing anything\nthat could then compromise that evidence.\n\n494\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.850\nAnd it's the same idea when we\napply it to the computer world.\n\n495\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.660\nWe have the right to prevent people from\nusing a system with the expectation that\n\n496\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.690\nthey may damage information or somehow\nviolate the integrity of that system,\n\n497\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.050\nin order to then safeguard the system and\nwait for\n\n498\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.220\na warrant to show up to\nbe able to investigate.\n\n499\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.660\nWe also have this idea\nof exigent circumstance.\n\n500\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.420\nAnd the idea that if you think somebody's\nbooby-trapped the system, we're allowed to\n\n501\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.560\ntake control of that system without\nhaving a warrant, to safeguard it.\n\n502\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.910\nThis is a right that we have\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n503\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.774\nWe also, as we said, have this idea of\nplain view, the plain view doctrine.\n\n504\n00:23:25.774 --> 00:23:29.517\nWe have the ability to say that if we\nwalk by and see somebody's got something\n\n505\n00:23:29.517 --> 00:23:33.630\nillegal up on their screen, we have an\nunderstanding that something's going on.\n\n506\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.030\nWe have the right to investigate.\n\n507\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.450\nWe don't need to have a warrant\nto be able to do that,\n\n508\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.540\nbecause you made it plainly obvious\nthat you're up to no good, right?\n\n509\n00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.691\nAnd so a lot of times when a police\nofficer pulls you over in a car, and\n\n510\n00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:47.229\nthey say I pulled you over because you\nwere going too fast back there, or\n\n511\n00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:51.028\nyour taillight's broken, or whatever\nthey tell you, right, whatever it is.\n\n512\n00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:53.043\nAnd what they may be\ndoing is just looking for\n\n513\n00:23:53.043 --> 00:23:56.324\nan opportunity to stop you because\nyou've been acting suspiciously.\n\n514\n00:23:56.324 --> 00:23:58.250\nMaybe they've been following you for\na while.\n\n515\n00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.120\nMaybe you're driving too slow,\n\n516\n00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.138\na lot of times they can't\njust pull you over for that.\n\n517\n00:24:03.138 --> 00:24:06.934\nSo they'll pull you over and say something\nlike well, we thought you were doing this,\n\n518\n00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:10.319\nbut what they really want is they want to\nget out of the car and talk to you a bit.\n\n519\n00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:13.906\nAnd they want to be able to look in the\ncar and see if there's anything in plain\n\n520\n00:24:13.906 --> 00:24:17.834\nview that would give them the opportunity\nto become suspicious and say essentially\n\n521\n00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:21.087\nhey guess what, based on the fact\nthat we see this suspicious thing,\n\n522\n00:24:21.087 --> 00:24:24.280\nwe're gonna now search this car,\nwe have justifiable cause.\n\n523\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.400\nThey don't need a warrant to do that.\n\n524\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.770\n&gt;&gt; I actually saw, I think it was\nthe ACLU video that said if you\n\n525\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.250\nget out of your car to speak with\na law enforcement officer and\n\n526\n00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.070\nyou don't lock the doors, it's an\nunattended vehicle and they can search it.\n\n527\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, because it's essentially\nconsidered an abandoned vehicle.\n\n528\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.740\nIt's unattended,\nthey don't need a warrant or\n\n529\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.170\nthey don't need the consent of\nthe owner to be able to search it.\n\n530\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.440\nWhich is why if you find a parked car on\nthe side of the road, they normally go in,\n\n531\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.280\nthey'll pop the lock, they'll tag it and\nthey'll wind up towing it\n\n532\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.020\nbecause it's considered an abandoned\nvehicle, or unattended.\n\n533\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.940\nSo yeah, it's a big deal, and\nI'm not saying this in a negative way.\n\n534\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.070\nFirmly support our police officers,\nfirmly support law enforcement.\n\n535\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:07.080\nJust pointing out that these days with\nall the craziness that's going on in our\n\n536\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.940\nworld, on both sides, both for\nus as people that are being protected and,\n\n537\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.970\nfairly, for law enforcement officers\nthat are doing the protecting.\n\n538\n00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.720\nIt's such a dangerous thing\nto get out of your car today,\n\n539\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.620\non both sides of that conversation.\n\n540\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.470\nBecause the law enforcement officer\ndoesn't know what your intentions are,\n\n541\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.360\nto be fair.\n\n542\n00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.000\nAnd they may not understand\nyour intentions when you get\n\n543\n00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.440\nout of the car to talk to them.\n\n544\n00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.350\nThey make it clear they'd prefer you stay\nin the car, you know, show your hands.\n\n545\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.071\n&gt;&gt; They do do that, yes.\n\n546\n00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:32.345\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They do that very carefully.\n\n547\n00:25:32.345 --> 00:25:33.682\nBut it's just not a good idea,\n\n548\n00:25:33.682 --> 00:25:36.560\nit's not like it was years ago where\nyou would get out of your car and\n\n549\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.740\nstand there and wait for\nthe officer to come up and talk to you.\n\n550\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.330\nUnfortunately, it's not\na good idea anymore.\n\n551\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.250\nAnd so it's really important for you to\nunderstand that, but it also takes away\n\n552\n00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.490\nthis issue of you stepped away from the\ncar, guess what we're gonna go search it.\n\n553\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.600\nWhile you're talking to\nsomebody over there,\n\n554\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.100\nmy partner's gonna go take a look\nat the car in the meantime.\n\n555\n00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.440\nUnless they ask you to get out of the car,\nand they tell you hey, get out of the car,\n\n556\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.130\ngo sit there, and this is what we're gonna\ndo, you should never get out of the car.\n\n557\n00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.100\nAnd you have, you have kids,\n\n558\n00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.494\nyoung kids, you won't have to\nworry about this for awhile.\n\n559\n00:26:03.494 --> 00:26:05.290\nWe were talking about this,\nI have girls as well.\n\n560\n00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.300\nAnd one of the things you got\nto teach them now, all kids,\n\n561\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.490\nmy oldest one is getting ready to drive.\n\n562\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.450\nYou gotta tell them this is how you\ndeal with if you go get stopped\n\n563\n00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.340\nby an officer for any reason,\nthis is the kinda stuff you gotta know.\n\n564\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.175\nYou don't get out of a car just\nbecause you wanna be friendly and\n\n565\n00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:22.275\ntalk to an officer cuz you could get shot.\n\n566\n00:26:22.275 --> 00:26:24.435\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it can happen.\n&gt;&gt; It's a pretty scary thing today.\n\n567\n00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:27.595\nAnd it's not just here in the US, I mean\nthis is in many places around the world,\n\n568\n00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:28.595\nyou gotta be very careful.\n\n569\n00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:30.398\n&gt;&gt; And maybe not intentionally\njust the whole [CROSSTALK].\n\n570\n00:26:30.398 --> 00:26:31.705\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not on purpose.\n\n571\n00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:34.185\nBecause they don't understand\nwhat you're doing.\n\n572\n00:26:34.185 --> 00:26:38.345\nThey think you may pose a threat to\nthem and as I said, rightly or wrongly,\n\n573\n00:26:38.345 --> 00:26:41.260\nthey just don't know what's in the mind\nof the person getting out of the car.\n\n574\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.710\nAnd unfortunately evidence has shown time\nand again that a lot of times people\n\n575\n00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.910\ngetting out of a car are getting out of\na car to do harm, not because they just\n\n576\n00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.720\nwant to be accessible to the officer,\nbut they are looking to do harm to that\n\n577\n00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.130\npolice officer, and\nthat's never a good thing, obviously.\n\n578\n00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.210\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n579\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.455\nSo fourth amendment does not apply,\nnot apply,\n\n580\n00:26:57.455 --> 00:27:02.540\nto private searches conducted by\na non-law enforcement third party.\n\n581\n00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.520\nKeep that in mind.\n\n582\n00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.700\nThe United States versus Jacobsen.\n\n583\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.300\nThe framework that\nessentially guides agent\n\n584\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.910\nseeking to uncover evidence as a result\nof a private search is laid out.\n\n585\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.620\nSo the United States versus Jacobsen,\n\n586\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.430\nanother big, important case in our\ncase law that we're going through.\n\n587\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.050\nFact that a person is acting independent\nof the government according to this,\n\n588\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.240\ndoes not always mean that a search\nis classified as private however.\n\n589\n00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.740\nSo just because, as I was saying earlier,\nthat we're acting in a private way,\n\n590\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.120\nnot as a law enforcement officer\nessentially gets me out of the idea of\n\n591\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.250\nhaving to have a warrant in those cases.\n\n592\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.680\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean,\n\n593\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.100\nthat my search is classified\nas private all the time.\n\n594\n00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.580\nI may be acting on behalf of law\nenforcement without directly\n\n595\n00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.780\nknowing I'm doing that.\n\n596\n00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.520\nA law enforcement officer may have asked\nme to do something on their behalf.\n\n597\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.600\nAnd then that's not considered\na classified private search anymore.\n\n598\n00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.520\nSo they are extenuating\ncircumstances to everything we do,\n\n599\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.580\nwe have to be very careful, and really\nvery clearly define what we're doing and\n\n600\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.960\nhave an expectation of the requirement\nin a law under which we operate.\n\n601\n00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.500\nA lot of these cases we are talking about,\na lot of these citations\n\n602\n00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.270\nthat we're mentioning are things that you\nmay not ever heard of, may not know about.\n\n603\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.705\nMost was then probably read\nSupreme Court case law all that often.\n\n604\n00:28:15.705 --> 00:28:19.315\nBut in this field, doing what we're\ntalking about doing, there are certain\n\n605\n00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:22.860\ncases you just have to be aware of because\nyou have to understand how to act.\n\n606\n00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.610\nIt's very, very important.\n\n607\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.270\nWhat about the use of technology\nto obtain information?\n\n608\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.590\nSo for instance,\nwe were talking about Faraday cages and\n\n609\n00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.870\nthe shielding in regards to things\nlike credit cards in your pockets.\n\n610\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.610\nWhat if we come up with a way to be able\nto read information from a cell phone\n\n611\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.370\nusing innovative technology\nthat would allow us to clone\n\n612\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.590\na bad actor cell phone\nto get that information.\n\n613\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.780\nIs that allowable under a search and\nseizure law?\n\n614\n00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.250\nDo we need a warrant to do that?\n\n615\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.650\nThese are questions that may\nnot have easy answers, right.\n\n616\n00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.050\n30, 40, 50, 100, 200 years ago, when\na lot of this stuff was written down, and\n\n617\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:59.050\nwhen the Constitution of the United States\nwas created, we didn't have these issues,\n\n618\n00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.630\nit was pretty simple.\n\n619\n00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.430\nYou either wrote it down on a piece of\npaper using a quill and ink or you didn't.\n\n620\n00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.430\nAnd if you didn't, it was in your head,\nnobody knew what it was.\n\n621\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.090\nToday, it's very different.\n\n622\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.610\nThe founders and the framers of\nthe Constitution didn't envision\n\n623\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.010\nthe kind of technology\nwe would have today.\n\n624\n00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.310\nThis is why we have courts.\n\n625\n00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.940\nThis is why we interpret law,\n\n626\n00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.620\nwhy this is seen as an elastic document,\na living document.\n\n627\n00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.970\nAnd so as a result,\nthe use of innovative technology,\n\n628\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.930\nwhich is the category we talk about\nthat's [INAUDIBLE] by the government or\n\n629\n00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.990\nits agents to obtain information may\nactually require the use of a warrant.\n\n630\n00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.260\nIt depends on the kind of\ntechnology being used,\n\n631\n00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.310\nand it depends on the way\nit's being deployed.\n\n632\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.410\nThe key criteria here, the key\ncriteria that the courts look at, and\n\n633\n00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.330\nthis is a case-by-case basis by the way,\n\n634\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.270\nthere's no standard that says all\nthe time without exception it's this.\n\n635\n00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.730\nIt is a case-by-case\nassessment of what was done.\n\n636\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.400\nBut the key criteria is whether or\n\n637\n00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.690\nnot the technology that is used is\navailable to the general public.\n\n638\n00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.200\nSo in other words,\n\n639\n00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.660\nif the general public has access to the\ntechnology then you don't need a warrant.\n\n640\n00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.210\nBut if the technology is only available\nto the government, you do need a warrant.\n\n641\n00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.530\nSo it's kind of interesting.\n\n642\n00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.390\nIn other words, for\n\n643\n00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:07.130\ninstance, give you a good example of this,\nyou know what a pineapple is?\n\n644\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.940\nYou're talking about the little-\n&gt;&gt; Small tropical fruit.\n\n645\n00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.407\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nI think you're talking about the router.\n\n646\n00:30:10.407 --> 00:30:11.933\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry,\nI'm just kidding with you.\n\n647\n00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:16.387\nSo, a pineapple is a generic kind of slang\nname in the security industry we give\n\n648\n00:30:16.387 --> 00:30:17.635\nto one of two things.\n\n649\n00:30:17.635 --> 00:30:21.250\nDaniel was talking about a small wireless\nrouter that we can use essentially,\n\n650\n00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.100\ncall it a pineapple, to clone and\nto mimic wireless systems.\n\n651\n00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.950\nWe also have a larger version of it that's\nused to clone and mimic cell towers.\n\n652\n00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.153\nAnd so if the government uses these\ndevices to set up a fake cell tower\n\n653\n00:30:33.153 --> 00:30:38.247\nlooking to essentually grab cell phones\nand triangulate to locate individuals so\n\n654\n00:30:38.247 --> 00:30:42.700\nthey can serve warrants,\nwhich is what they will sometimes do.\n\n655\n00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.130\nThis technology is only\navailable to the government,\n\n656\n00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.520\nit's illegal to own this technology,\neven though there's instructions on how\n\n657\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.695\nto set one up and\nbuild one out there on the internet.\n\n658\n00:30:50.695 --> 00:30:51.712\nThese things are not that big,\n\n659\n00:30:51.712 --> 00:30:55.460\nthey're roughly the size of laptop,\nthey're not hard to manufacture.\n\n660\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.100\nBut it's a felony,\nIt's illegal to own one.\n\n661\n00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.470\nIf you were to use that technology to\nbe able to spy on somebody, snoop on\n\n662\n00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.630\nsomebody, investigate, whatever, you\nhave to have a warrant to be able to do\n\n663\n00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.030\nthat because it is not commonly available\ntechnology under this interpretation.\n\n664\n00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.670\nBut the wireless version, the one that you\nwere talking about that we can set up,\n\n665\n00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.520\nthat is legal to own, you can buy them,\nabout 100 bucks or something like that.\n\n666\n00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.190\nYou can get them online and\n\n667\n00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.480\nyou can also see instruction how to\nbuild one yourself for that matter.\n\n668\n00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.970\nIt's not illegal to own,\nit is publicly available.\n\n669\n00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.130\nYou can use that, you don't need\na warrant for that necessarily.\n\n670\n00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.570\nSo it's a distinction that's really\nimportant, because it's about whether or\n\n671\n00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.670\nnot the technologies in general use, or\n\n672\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.400\nwhether the technology is only\navailable to law enforcement.\n\n673\n00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.350\nIt's only available to law enforcement,\nthe government,\n\n674\n00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.470\ngenerically, then warrants are required.\n\n675\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.690\n&gt;&gt; So I bet people are making huge pushes\nto make this technology available to\n\n676\n00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.750\nthe general public.\n\n677\n00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.700\nSo that they can hack around\nwith it a little more [LAUGH].\n\n678\n00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Well it's one of those\ninteresting dichotomies,\n\n679\n00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.590\none of those interesting splits.\n\n680\n00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.400\nAnd as you pointed out earlier,\nthe law may change over time,\n\n681\n00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.240\nit's a moving boundary, and\nwe have to think about this as well.\n\n682\n00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.030\nWhen we come back and\n\n683\n00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.850\ntalk about this in the next episode\nin our part duex, as they say.\n\n684\n00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:04.660\nPart deux, do it with me.\n\n685\n00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Part deux.\n\n686\n00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Part deux,\nyou gotta do like both fingers up.\n\n687\n00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.630\nPart duex, there we go, part deux.\n\n688\n00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.170\nSo in part two, we're gonna to talk about\nexceptions to the warrant requirement.\n\n689\n00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.340\nYou've heard me mention\nexigent circumstance.\n\n690\n00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.100\nYou've heard me talked about consent and\nthe plain view doctrine,\n\n691\n00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.820\nwe'll talk a little bit\nmore about some of those.\n\n692\n00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.645\nBut things like search as a result of\nlawful arrest, inventory searches,\n\n693\n00:32:22.645 --> 00:32:26.130\nborder searches, international issues.\n\n694\n00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.015\nDo you know whether or not we can search\nat a border with or without a warrant?\n\n695\n00:32:29.015 --> 00:32:29.745\nI have no idea.\n\n696\n00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:31.365\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna find out\nwhen you come back.\n\n697\n00:32:31.365 --> 00:32:32.185\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait to see.\n\n698\n00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:34.140\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna tell you,\nI'm gonna tell you.\n\n699\n00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.845\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n700\n00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:38.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well obviously there is\ndefinitely, this is an interesting topic.\n\n701\n00:32:38.955 --> 00:32:42.325\nIt's a very pertinent topic to our\nconversation as being investigator or\n\n702\n00:32:42.325 --> 00:32:45.775\nsomeone that is actually\ngoing to need to search and\n\n703\n00:32:45.775 --> 00:32:48.185\nseize a certain devices and information.\n\n704\n00:32:48.185 --> 00:32:50.320\nSo stuff that you're definitely\ngonna wanna know about.\n\n705\n00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.795\nWe've got a lot more to go down.\n\n706\n00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.430\nPart two is definitely on\nour way as we alluded to.\n\n707\n00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.585\nAdam, thank you so much.\n\n708\n00:32:56.585 --> 00:32:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We thank you, guys, for watching.\n\n709\n00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust call it quits for today, signing

00:00:12.424\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:14.344\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.686\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:19.939\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.550\nwell, it's more on our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.776\nAnd joining us back in the studio is a man\nthat knows no limits when it comes to\n\n9\n00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:27.997\nsearch and seizure.\n\n10\n00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:29.429\nIt's our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.257\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:30.962\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.019\n&gt;&gt; Calgon to you sir, good day.\n\n14\n00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right back at you, calgon.\n\n15\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.559\n&gt;&gt; All right, so all is well,\nall is well here in Studio Four.\n\n16\n00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.587\nLet us continue.\n\n17\n00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:44.098\nLet us continue talking about the\nintricacies, and I do mean intricacies,\n\n18\n00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:48.550\nof search and seizure with regards to\nwarrants and warrantless searches.\n\n19\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.390\nWe were talking in the last\nepisode about whether or\n\n20\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.150\nnot you need a warrant and\nunder what circumstance.\n\n21\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.070\nWent through this whole conversation,\nDaniel was kind enough to help us out\n\n22\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.470\nwith, with regards to different scenarios,\nright, and how they would play out.\n\n23\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.940\nAnd I previewed some of the ones\nwe're gonna talk about now\n\n24\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.030\nwith you a little bit.\n\n25\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.060\nTalked about exceptions to\nthe warrant requirements.\n\n26\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210\nAnd there are definitely exceptions.\n\n27\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.140\nThere are seven of them, specifically,\nthat you should be aware of,\n\n28\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.290\nespecially if you're gonna\nplan on taking the CHFI exam.\n\n29\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.315\nMight wanna know these kinds of things,\n\n30\n00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:17.960\nthey're categories that\nmay get asked about.\n\n31\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.985\nThey're things that as examiners in\nthe real world, we wanna be aware of.\n\n32\n00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:24.160\nThere's consent,\nwe've talked about the scope of consent.\n\n33\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.558\nWe'll go back and review that.\n\n34\n00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:29.130\nYou've heard me talk about\nexigent circumstances.\n\n35\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.450\nThat's why you need to drink coffee,\nso you can say that word.\n\n36\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.920\nExigent circumstances.\n\n37\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.770\nWe've talked about the doctrine of\nplain view, we'll talk about that.\n\n38\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.900\nSearch as a result of a lawful arrest.\n\n39\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.500\nYou basically have nothing going on there.\n\n40\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.130\nThey arrest you, pretty much that's it.\n\n41\n00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.420\nYou have anything on you,\nthey're gonna find it.\n\n42\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.830\nBut inventory searches, as a business\nowner when we have inventory,\n\n43\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.840\nwhat kind of rights are there?\n\n44\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.430\nWhat do we do?\nHow do we deal with that?\n\n45\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.225\nBorder searches,\nI mentioned that at the end of the show.\n\n46\n00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.740\nAsked Daniel whether he understood whether\nwe could search at the border with or\n\n47\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.640\nwithout a warrant, and I said we would\nfind out the answer to that question here.\n\n48\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.510\nAnd then international issues, how do we\ndeal with treaties and things like that,\n\n49\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.330\nand how do we deal with cross-border\nsearches is one way of looking at it.\n\n50\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.820\nBut how do we deal with things where\nwe may have signed a treaty and\n\n51\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.580\nas a result we may have to give up, or\n\n52\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.440\nallow certain things to happen,\nand we'll talk about that as well.\n\n53\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.818\nWe'll take a look at some interesting\nstuff that's online to help us\n\n54\n00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:20.710\nunderstand that.\n\n55\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.260\nSo let's start with consent,\nwhat the scope of consent is.\n\n56\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.851\nThe idea here, and again, we're talking\nabout the thought process being defined\n\n57\n00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.918\nthrough the US Federal rules of evidence,\nUnited States Supreme Court,\n\n58\n00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:34.309\nlaw of the land in the US.\n\n59\n00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.078\nThis is what we're talking about here.\n\n60\n00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:39.680\nTranslate that into your world\ndepending to where you live,\n\n61\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.710\nas I've been telling you\nas we go through this.\n\n62\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.460\nSo the scope of consent\nis as defined here.\n\n63\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.690\nScope of consent to a search is generally\ndefined by its expressed object, and\n\n64\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.008\nis limited by the breadth\nof the consent given,\n\n65\n00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.670\naccording to the United States\nversus Pena.\n\n66\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.012\nWhich is again a case that was\nseen in the US circuit courts\n\n67\n00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.547\nprobably around 1998 or so,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n68\n00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:05.294\nGotta stop talking out of turn here.\n\n69\n00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:08.036\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I remember correctly, but the idea\n\n70\n00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:12.949\nwith the definition is that we have to\nunderstand that when we give consent,\n\n71\n00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.280\nconsent may not be a blanket consent\nto search any and everything.\n\n72\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.210\nConsent may be limited, right?\n\n73\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.020\nIt's generally defined\nby its expressed object,\n\n74\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.410\nlimited by the breadth\nof the consent given.\n\n75\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.420\nIf I tell you it's okay to search\nwhat's in this room in Studio Four,\n\n76\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.910\nthat doesn't mean you can\nsearch the whole building.\n\n77\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.460\nIt means you can search\nwhat's in Studio Four.\n\n78\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.341\nIt doesn't mean you can go into\nthe bathroom, or Studio Five.\n\n79\n00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:37.740\nIt means that you can only\nsearch what's in this room.\n\n80\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.940\nHowever, if there's something in\nplain sight laying in the hallway\n\n81\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.040\nbetween here and there,\n\n82\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.010\nyou may have the ability to interact\nwith that because it's not hidden.\n\n83\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.830\nIt's not in any way\ntrying to be unobvious.\n\n84\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.140\nAnd as a result, the court has said,\nhey guess what, you walk down the hall and\n\n85\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.030\nyou see something laying in the hallway\non your way to search another area of\n\n86\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.820\nthe building, you can interact with\nthat because it's in plain view.\n\n87\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.760\n&gt;&gt; Adam, would an unlocked door or\ndrawer, or\n\n88\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.450\nsomething like that be considered in\nplain view because it wasn't secured?\n\n89\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.842\n&gt;&gt; Well, you said unlocked,\nyou didn't say unlocked and open.\n\n90\n00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:09.731\n&gt;&gt; So unlocked is unlocked, right?\n\n91\n00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.360\nBut unlocked and\nopen is very different from unlocked.\n\n92\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.160\nUnlocked is just that, it's a state.\n\n93\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.000\nWe don't know if the drawer's unlocked or\nnot because we haven't tried it.\n\n94\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.420\nAnd if it's not something that we\nare supposed to be interacting with,\n\n95\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.710\nwe have no reason to walk up and\nsee whether it's open or closed.\n\n96\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.615\nBut if the drawer is open on\na filing cabinet, it's a good point,\n\n97\n00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:33.159\nas you're walking down the hallway and\nthe door is open, and you could see in\n\n98\n00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.283\nplain view just by walking by\nwhat's in there, that's different.\n\n99\n00:04:37.283 --> 00:04:39.784\nBecause it's not part of what\nwe've been told we can search, but\n\n100\n00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.930\nit's also out in plain view at that point.\n\n101\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.380\nSo it would have to be open, literally\nunlocked, rather to use your terminology,\n\n102\n00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.640\nas well as being open before\nwe can then actually interact.\n\n103\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.500\nSo it's just, again, there's a gray\narea there in the sense that\n\n104\n00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.320\nwe have to be very specific and\nvery, very focused, right,\n\n105\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.740\non our definition, on our description\nof what it is that's happening.\n\n106\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.520\nOpen is not the same thing as unlocked and\nopen, right?\n\n107\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.304\nAnd so that's something,\n\n108\n00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.470\nor rather unlocked's not the same\nthing as unlocked and open.\n\n109\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.000\nSo we would need to be aware of that.\n\n110\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.560\nThe standard for measuring the scope of\nconsent under the Fourth Amendment is,\n\n111\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.020\nas we said, objective reasonableness.\n\n112\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.700\nThe objective reasonableness thought\nprocess is essentially the following.\n\n113\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.950\nWhat would the typical reasonable\nperson have understood by the exchange\n\n114\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.970\nbetween the agent and\nthe person granting consent?\n\n115\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.490\nIn other words, if I say to Daniel, Daniel\ndo I have the right to search Studio Four\n\n116\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.520\nand Daniel says, yes you do, what do I as\na reasonable person take away from that?\n\n117\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.910\nWell, Daniel, I'm assuming has the right\nto give me that authority to search.\n\n118\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.880\nAnd he said yeah, search anything that's,\nor he hasn't said search anything.\n\n119\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.010\nBut he said,\ndo I have the right to search Studio Four?\n\n120\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.889\nYes, you do.\n\n121\n00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.142\nI could search anything\nfound within Studio Four.\n\n122\n00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.442\nThere is our console here,\nour table, right?\n\n123\n00:05:47.442 --> 00:05:49.560\nWe've got some nooks and\ncrannies under here, right?\n\n124\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.640\nSo we may be able to search\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n125\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.090\nThere's a table sitting over in\nthe corner, as we talked about.\n\n126\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.440\nMay be able to search stuff\nthat's sitting on there.\n\n127\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.010\nSo for instance,\nI know we did this in theory, but\n\n128\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.300\ncan we actually do this for real?\n\n129\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.420\nCan we pan the camera and take a look\nat that table for just a second?\n\n130\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.990\nWe've done that before, and it'll take\na second for us to rotate to do that.\n\n131\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.350\nBut the reason, and it's slow, so hold\non to your seats here, boys and girls.\n\n132\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.940\nWe're going on a field trip, right?\n\n133\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.330\nAll right, so\nif you could just bring it up.\n\n134\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.470\nYeah, zoom back just a little bit.\n\n135\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.235\nThat's fine right there,\ngood, good, good, stop.\n\n136\n00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:19.690\nWhoa, there we go, all right.\n\n137\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.960\nSo floating in space,\nhere we are in Studio Four.\n\n138\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.110\nReason I'm asking you to\ndo this is the following.\n\n139\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.640\nLet's describe what's\nsitting on that table.\n\n140\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.910\nNow I know it's dark, it's hard to see.\n\n141\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.350\nThe background's a little dark.\n\n142\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.780\nWe don't have a light shining on it.\n\n143\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.870\nBut you see a water bottle sitting there,\n\n144\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.050\nyou see what appears to be\nsomething holding up a napkin.\n\n145\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.750\nIt's actually my coffee cup, right?\n\n146\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.400\nBut the coffee cup is\ncovered by two napkins.\n\n147\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.090\nNow it's sitting on the table in the room\nthat Daniel gave us the right to search.\n\n148\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.311\nSo do I have the right under\nthe reasonable person clause, or\n\n149\n00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.345\nthe reasonable person understanding,\nthe objective,\n\n150\n00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:55.340\nreasonableness clause in\nthe Fourth Amendment to understand this.\n\n151\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.860\nDo I have the right to go over and\nsearch what's inside that coffee cup,\n\n152\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.040\nbecause you gave me the right\nto search this room?\n\n153\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.100\n&gt;&gt; That's a very good question.\n\n154\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.180\nI'm gonna go with yes.\n\n155\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.690\n&gt;&gt; And you would be right, because\nit's in the room sitting on the table.\n\n156\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.788\nIt's not private property,\nit's out in plain view, and\n\n157\n00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:13.762\nit's not considered closed\nbecause I have a napkin over\n\n158\n00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:17.258\nto keep the contents of the cup safe and\nkeep bugs out of whatever.\n\n159\n00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:18.127\nIt's just sitting here.\n\n160\n00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:21.808\nI could go over and search that, take\na sample of it, do whatever I wanna do.\n\n161\n00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.379\nAnd that would be perfectly acceptable.\n\n162\n00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.482\nAs a reasonable person, in other words,\nI would interpret that as being within\n\n163\n00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:29.050\nthe boundaries of the search,\nwould be nothing wrong with that.\n\n164\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.273\nNow if I found a backpack sitting here,\nto your point earlier.\n\n165\n00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:34.203\nNobody's in here,\nI have no idea whose backpack it is,\n\n166\n00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:35.271\nand it's sitting in the room,\n\n167\n00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:38.220\nand you gave me the right to search,\ncould I open that backpack and search it?\n\n168\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.230\n&gt;&gt; I would go with no, because it's\nprivate property and it's closed.\n\n169\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.104\n&gt;&gt; But you don't know whose\nprivate property it is.\n\n170\n00:07:43.104 --> 00:07:44.476\nIt's inside the room-\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n171\n00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:46.320\n&gt;&gt; That you gave me the right to search.\n\n172\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.270\n&gt;&gt; What if it had a tag on\nthat had the person's name?\n\n173\n00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.883\n&gt;&gt; Would I still have\nthe right to search it?\n\n174\n00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:53.449\nDoes knowing the person's name\nchange that, in other words, right,\n\n175\n00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:54.400\nis what I'm suggesting.\n\n176\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.035\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n177\n00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:56.203\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't, right?\n\n178\n00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:58.233\nBecause it's inside the room, so\n\n179\n00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:02.854\nreasonable person I may interpret your\ngiving me consent as the owner to search\n\n180\n00:08:02.854 --> 00:08:07.850\nthe room as searching anything in the\nroom, including in theory, a bag or a box.\n\n181\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.680\nBut if the bag was locked,\ngo back to the, hey,\n\n182\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.880\nwe've gotta open the briefcase concept,\nright?\n\n183\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.110\nA computer, right?\n\n184\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.940\nDo I have the right to go\nopen that bag if it's locked?\n\n185\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.910\nNo, because you didn't say,\nand by the way,\n\n186\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.980\nyou can break into anything\nyou find in the room.\n\n187\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You simply said,\n\n188\n00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.120\nyou can search what's in the room.\n\n189\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.770\nIf it's locked, it's considered to be\nsomething I'm not, according to my\n\n190\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.280\ndefinition, as a reasonable person,\nprobably, suppose to interact with, right?\n\n191\n00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.000\nSo, a computer that's in the room,\nlike the ones on our desk here, right,\n\n192\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.410\nif they're open the way ours are,\nlogged on, and\n\n193\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.530\navailable, if I walk up to them,\nI may be able to interact with them.\n\n194\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.950\nBut, if they're closed, or lid down, or\nlid up, or locked out, as a reasonable\n\n195\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.420\nperson I don't have an expectation that\nI should be able to search that machine.\n\n196\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.390\nIt's variable and it depends on how\na reasonable person would interpret that.\n\n197\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.060\nThis is one of the things we have to\nthink about and we have to consider.\n\n198\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.900\nSo again, some grey areas there.\n\n199\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.970\nThings that we may or\nmay not necessarily think about, right?\n\n200\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.670\nScope of search is dependent on the facts\nof the case, is what the law often says.\n\n201\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.930\nThere are extenuating circumstances\nthat may change our interpretation\n\n202\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.240\nof what the scope may or may not be.\n\n203\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.160\nWhat about third party consent?\n\n204\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.860\nWe've talked about this,\n\n205\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.430\nDaniel giving us the right to search\nas a representative of the business.\n\n206\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.500\nIs essentially giving us\nthe right to search the premises.\n\n207\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.490\nBut what about me giving Daniel\nthe right to use my machine and\n\n208\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.760\nthen him giving someone else the right\nto search my machine when I'm not there,\n\n209\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.950\nthat's third party consent, and we have\nto think about that, and understand that.\n\n210\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.620\nIn general, any user of the computer under\ntheir authority may permit a search,\n\n211\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.760\naccording to the law.\n\n212\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.258\nSo, if I let Daniel use my machine, and\nI say, at that point, I walk away and\n\n213\n00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.961\nsay, Daniel, just take good care of it,\nright, [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:43.330\nDon't do anything crazy.\n\n215\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.818\nI walk away and somebody walks up,\nPeter, Mike, Titus, whoever walks up and\n\n216\n00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:50.131\nsay, hey I want to search that machine.\n\n217\n00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.804\nYou as the person sitting down and\n\n218\n00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:55.290\nusing it has the authority to grant\nthem that right at that time.\n\n219\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Now here's a,\n\n220\n00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.480\nmaybe this is well out of the,\njust something weird that might happen.\n\n221\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.800\nIf you came in as an investigator and\nyou saw someone in the room and\n\n222\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.320\nthey looked and they even said,\nyes, I'm a manager here and\n\n223\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.020\nI give you consent to search studio four,\nbut they weren't.\n\n224\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.080\nThey lied.\n\n225\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.190\nAnd you searched studio four.\n\n226\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.970\nYou found contraband or something illegal,\nor whatever it is you were looking for.\n\n227\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.060\nIs that evidence still admissible\nbecause you had a reasonable\n\n228\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.480\nbelief that he was the manager?\n\n229\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you acted, in other words,\nunder reasonable assumption and\n\n230\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.630\nyou did not purposefully try to seek to\ngo around the law, right, and say okay.\n\n231\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.010\nDaniel, pretend you're the manager.\n\n232\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now tell me as the manager that I can\n\n233\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.165\nsearch it.\n\n234\n00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:36.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Us both knowing you're not the manager,\n\n235\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.650\nwink, wink, nod, nod, right.\n\n236\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.440\nSo if you operate under the assumption\nthat somebody that represents\n\n237\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.830\nthemselves that way is legitimately\nin a position of authority.\n\n238\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.970\nThen, it's again, It's gonna be.\n\n239\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.810\n&gt;&gt; Gray area\n&gt;&gt; Well, no not gray, but\n\n240\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.690\nit's contingent on the circumstances\nof at that point, the context,\n\n241\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.880\nwhat I would suggest is, and\nwe made this statement earlier.\n\n242\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.930\nI'm fumbling over my words, let me\njust go back one second to my notes,\n\n243\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.790\nI'll read you the exact note I made.\n\n244\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.700\nScope of search is dependent\non facts of the case,\n\n245\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.170\nwhat I was trying to come up with.\n\n246\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.990\nMeaning, at that point,\nas an investigator,\n\n247\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.400\nwhen you get to trial,\nbefore the full trial takes place.\n\n248\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.780\nWe have what are called pre-trial motions,\nright?\n\n249\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.070\nAt that point a lot of this\nkind of stuff comes up and\n\n250\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.450\nyou're gonna say you with that point,\nhey, the is defense gonna say, hey,\n\n251\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.980\nyou know what, this evidence should\nthrown out judge because so and\n\n252\n00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.980\nso lied and as the result they found\nsomething they weren't suppose to see.\n\n253\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.570\nAnd the prosecutors gonna say, hold on\nsecond, not so quick, so and so, yes, they\n\n254\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.270\ndid misrepresent themselves but our agent\noperated on the assumptions in good faith.\n\n255\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.360\nThat because they had an ITPro.TV shirt,\nright?\n\n256\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.190\nAnd let's pan to to Daniel for a second.\n\n257\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.012\nSo he has an ITPro.TV shirt, we assume\nthat since he represented himself\n\n258\n00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:55.160\nas being a member of the ITPro.TV staff,\nhe claimed that he was a manager.\n\n259\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.870\nHe seemed to be on the premises legally,\nhe seemed to belong there, right?\n\n260\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.440\nAnd as a result, we operated on the\nassumption when he gave us the permission\n\n261\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.660\nto do this that he was acting as\na representative of the business.\n\n262\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.480\nWe're going to make the case that we\nshould be able to use that evidence\n\n263\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.850\nbecause we acted in good faith.\n\n264\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.870\nAnd, that's exactly what we would\nessentially counter, right,\n\n265\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.220\nwith the defense argument.\n\n266\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.840\nAnd then the judge has to decide.\n\n267\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.780\nSo, it's contingent on\ncircumstance a lot of the times.\n\n268\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.093\nIf we knowingly act on information\nthat is false, then yeah,\n\n269\n00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:26.335\nit gets thrown out, no two ways about it.\n\n270\n00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:29.170\nListen, you lied and you screwed up.\n\n271\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.980\nYou're both wrong.\n\n272\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But if you lie, and\n\n273\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.850\nI believe you in good faith,\nI'm not necessarily wrong.\n\n274\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.950\nRight?\nWe may still call you a liar, and\n\n275\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.100\nhold you accountable, but\n\n276\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.730\nthat doesn't mean that what I\nfound necessarily cannot be used.\n\n277\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.510\nIt's contingent on circumstance.\n\n278\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; So general on third party consent for\n\n279\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.360\ncomputers and this gets people\nout of trouble all the time,\n\n280\n00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.810\nyou let somebody use your machine and\nsomebody else gives away the right for\n\n281\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.390\nyou to be able to keep that machine secret\nand confidential, you've got a problem.\n\n282\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.360\nThat's something to consider.\n\n283\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.320\nWhat about parental consent?\n\n284\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.180\nI mentioned this in one\nof our prior episodes.\n\n285\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.560\nUnder 18 the parents have the right,\nas I said if you live at home,\n\n286\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.200\nto give free reign to law\nenforcement to search your stuff,\n\n287\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.860\nyou've got nothing to say about it, right.\n\n288\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.900\nIf you're over 18,\nit's contingent on facts.\n\n289\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.168\nIf law enforcement shows up and\nsays, listen,\n\n290\n00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:14.446\nwe think Johnny may be a serial killer,\nright?\n\n291\n00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:16.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We need to take a look under his bed.\n\n292\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.740\nIf they have compelling evidence,\nthe parents can grant that right whether\n\n293\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.800\nJohnny's home or not, and\nJohnny's got nothing to say about it.\n\n294\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.340\nIf the facts don't support them\ngetting consent from a parent,\n\n295\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.850\nthat search may get thrown out.\n\n296\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.905\nBecause now you're a major living\nin In somebody else's house,\n\n297\n00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:34.865\nyou have certain rights\nthat a minor does not have.\n\n298\n00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:36.485\n&gt;&gt; You're like a tenant at that point.\n\n299\n00:13:36.485 --> 00:13:37.755\n&gt;&gt; Potentially, but it would depend.\n\n300\n00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:40.185\nAgain it's circumstantial and factual.\n\n301\n00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:42.715\nDo you have an actual\ncontract to rent space?\n\n302\n00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:44.435\nAre you just living at home?\n\n303\n00:13:44.435 --> 00:13:46.185\n&gt;&gt; Something like a resident maybe.\n\n304\n00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:49.155\n&gt;&gt; What's your expectation of privacy?\n\n305\n00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:50.215\nAre you a roommate in a.\n\n306\n00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:51.835\n&gt;&gt; Common area\n&gt;&gt; Common area.\n\n307\n00:13:51.835 --> 00:13:54.850\nSo you know when people live together and\nthey're not married but\n\n308\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.340\nyou're living as a roommate.\n\n309\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.410\nYou guys have essentially your own rooms,\nthings like that.\n\n310\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.190\nIs there an expectation of privacy?\n\n311\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.200\nThere's all these contingent\ncircumstances we'd have to think about.\n\n312\n00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.650\nSpouses or domestic partners, either may\nconsent to a search of the property.\n\n313\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.408\nSo if you pissed your wife off guess what?\n\n314\n00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:12.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's it you're done, right.\n\n315\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.935\n&gt;&gt; No more meth selling for you.\n\n316\n00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:15.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna show him boy.\n\n317\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.700\nHe's done.\n\n318\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.170\nI'm gonna get rid of all that\nstuff in the garage, right.\n\n319\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.660\nAnd so either spouse has the right to\nessentially grant the law enforcement\n\n320\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.330\nagent or the representative, whoever's\nthere, the right to search the premises.\n\n321\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.930\nWhether or not the other spouse agrees or\nis even there.\n\n322\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.070\nThat's again, an issue.\n\n323\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.010\nNow you get into this issue of, okay so\nwe're married, but what about common law?\n\n324\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:36.770\nWhere you're not married, but\n\n325\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.630\nyou've been together long enough that\nessentially you're considered a spouse.\n\n326\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.020\nSame rules apply.\n\n327\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.870\nWhat about people that are living\ntogether but are not married?\n\n328\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.180\nThere's distinctions we\nwould have to think about.\n\n329\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.890\nBut at a certain point, either party\nhas a right to consent to search.\n\n330\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.230\nWhat about system administrators?\n\n331\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.510\nThis is one that touches\nus directly in IT.\n\n332\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.940\nTypically they service an agent\nas agents of the providers of\n\n333\n00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.000\nelectronic communication services,\nunder what's known as the EPCA,\n\n334\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.860\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n335\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.110\nAnd under\nthe Electronic Communication Privacy Act,\n\n336\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.780\nsystem administrators have the right\nto grant the ability to search.\n\n337\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.340\nSo again, they are the caretakers,\nthe system administrators, the overseers,\n\n338\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.420\nthey have the right to grant to search or\n\n339\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.510\nsearch request under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n340\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.210\nThis is what comes into play with call\nproviders again as we've talked about\n\n341\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.050\nalthough not just here in the US, but\nbroadly around all sorts of places.\n\n342\n00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.489\nWhat about implied consent,\n\n343\n00:15:26.489 --> 00:15:31.420\nwe've talked about this with regards to\nprivacy expectations, implied consent.\n\n344\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.850\nIndividuals often enter into agreement\nwith either employers or things like that.\n\n345\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.000\nFor instance,\nI'm staying in a hotel while I'm here and\n\n346\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.240\nI have entered into an implied\nconsent agreement with the hotel.\n\n347\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.160\nIf I have my stuff in my room, they have\nthe right to come in and clean the room.\n\n348\n00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.310\nYou and I were talking about\nthis before we got on.\n\n349\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.751\nAnd my neighbor who is potentially,\nI don't know what's going on there.\n\n350\n00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:56.079\nBut you know, the idea is that I've\nentered into an implied consent agreement\n\n351\n00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.728\nwith the owners of the hotel.\n\n352\n00:15:57.728 --> 00:16:00.609\nBecause they have the right to enter\nmy room under certain circumstances,\n\n353\n00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:02.128\nto do things whether I'm there or not.\n\n354\n00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.289\nAnd that's kind of the example\nwe're talking about.\n\n355\n00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:08.310\nLaw enforcement can show up and\nsay, hey, who's in room XYZ?\n\n356\n00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.760\nHey, we have a warrant,\nwe're going to search that, open the door.\n\n357\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.200\nYou've entered into an implied consent,\nthey can come do that.\n\n358\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.040\nExigent circumstances.\n\n359\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.840\nExigent circumstances as I mentioned are\ncircumstances that lead the person that is\n\n360\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.600\nthere, on the spot, in the middle of this\nto say, you know what, if I don't act.\n\n361\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.720\nBad things are going to happen.\n\n362\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.220\nData's going to get destroyed.\n\n363\n00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.090\nLife, safety issues are a concern,\nsomebody's going to get hurt.\n\n364\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.180\nThose are reasons for\nme to act without a warrant.\n\n365\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.910\nThose are reasons for\n\n366\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.900\nme to take immediate action and worry\nabout the legality of it after the fact.\n\n367\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.960\nBecause I can prove after the fact that I\n\n368\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.970\nfelt that at that moment that\nwas the right thing to do.\n\n369\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.320\nAnd if I can do that legitimately,\n\n370\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.730\nthen I probably don't need a warrant\nto be able to take that action.\n\n371\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in some place, they even have\nGood Samaritan laws where you are bound\n\n372\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.204\nby law to act if you see somebody being\nhurt or [CROSSTALK] things like that.\n\n373\n00:16:57.204 --> 00:17:01.416\nYou know, when I got certified\nFirst Aid and CPR, years ago,\n\n374\n00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:05.952\nthey told you at that time,\nwhen you are certified to provide CPR or\n\n375\n00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:10.675\nfirst aid, if you drive by,\nkind of a good Samaritan situation.\n\n376\n00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:15.435\nIf you drive by or walk by or whatever, or\nyou see somebody in need of assistance and\n\n377\n00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:20.570\nyou don't stop, and you don't offer\nassistance and somebody sees you,\n\n378\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.280\nknows that you are certified and\nessentially rats you out,\n\n379\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.700\nyou actually can get prosecuted because\nyou failed to provide assistance.\n\n380\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.630\nNow, the flip side of that,\nthe Good Samaritan laws,\n\n381\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.110\nif you stop and you offer assistance,\nyou're not held liable for\n\n382\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.830\nanything you try to do to save\nthat person, potentially.\n\n383\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.153\nSo if you offer CPR assistance,\nlet's say, and [CROSSTALK]\n\n384\n00:17:41.153 --> 00:17:42.063\n&gt;&gt; Heimlich maneuver, and\n\n385\n00:17:42.063 --> 00:17:43.240\nbreak their ribs or something.\n\n386\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Something like that,\nmaybe you break their sternum.\n\n387\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They've been hurt as a result\n\n388\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.740\n&gt;&gt; They can't sue you for\n\n389\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.920\ntrying to help them.\n\n390\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.520\nYou're protected that way, but\nyou're bound essentially to offer support.\n\n391\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.980\nSo, it cuts both ways so,\nyou have to think about.\n\n392\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.550\nBut with regards to exigent circumstances,\nelectronic data is considered perishable.\n\n393\n00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.040\nIf I am thinking as\nsomebody who's on the scene\n\n394\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.320\nthat somebody's booby trapped, right?\n\n395\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.560\nThat machine which often is the case\n&gt;&gt; And espionage cases and\n\n396\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.510\nthings of this nature.\n\n397\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.310\nWe're not talking about you hacking in and\n\n398\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.710\ntaking a look at somebody's\ncomputer just for fun.\n\n399\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.880\nWe're talking about you're stealing the\nrecipe for Coca-Cola or whatever it is.\n\n400\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n401\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.910\nIf you're doing that kind of stuff then,\nI mean, this is a significant issue.\n\n402\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.310\nAs a result,\nwe may have to act to stop you.\n\n403\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:33.180\nSo a lot of times when you see federal\nraids that take place Treasury Department,\n\n404\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.110\nSecret Service, FBI, whatever it is.\n\n405\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.300\nIf they raided a business because they\nfeel there's a computer crime going on,\n\n406\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.290\naside from the fact that they go in with\nwindbreakers, they identify who they are,\n\n407\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.540\nthey will typically show up with guns,\nwhich they often do.\n\n408\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.020\nThey will come in, and this is not,\n\n409\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.580\nhey by the way we're here and\nwe're going to wait over there.\n\n410\n00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.080\nWhen you're done can you tell us so\nwe can talk to you.\n\n411\n00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.560\nThis is guns out,\nstep away from the computer, if you move,\n\n412\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.275\nwe're going to shoot you, right?\n\n413\n00:18:57.275 --> 00:18:58.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because they're worried.\n\n414\n00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.442\n&gt;&gt; So they're serious?\n\n415\n00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:00.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're very serious.\n\n416\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.483\nThey're only there to inspire\nthe warning shot in the ceiling.\n\n417\n00:19:02.483 --> 00:19:02.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n418\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.110\n&gt;&gt; They only do that in the movies,\nthey don't do that for real.\n\n419\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.630\n&gt;&gt; No they don't.\n\n420\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.510\n&gt;&gt; But they come in with their guns drawn.\n\n421\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.640\nAnd they will tell you unequivocally,\nif you make a move, we will shoot you.\n\n422\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.540\nBecause they are worried about the fact\nthat you booby-trapped the machine.\n\n423\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.800\nAnd if you hit a key,\nyou could wipe out what's on that machine.\n\n424\n00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.420\nAnd they don't mess\naround with this stuff.\n\n425\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.480\nSometimes they'll show up with SWAT teams.\n\n426\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.380\nI mean this is like real stuff.\n\n427\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.900\nThey're really serious\nabout this kind of stuff.\n\n428\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.820\nSo it's very, very important for\n\n429\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.810\nyou to understand the concept\nof exigent circumstances, right.\n\n430\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.010\nWhat are the criteria to assess against?\n\n431\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.340\nDegree of urgency.\n\n432\n00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.590\nAgain, life safety,\nprobability you're going to do harm,\n\n433\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.720\nthose kind of things, amount of time\nit may take to obtain a warrant.\n\n434\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.370\nHey, you know what?\n\n435\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.750\nThere's no way we're getting a warrant,\nit's gonna take 48 hours.\n\n436\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.700\nWell, stuff on this machine is going to\nbe gone in 12 cuz we don't have a power\n\n437\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.740\nadapter and there's no way to keep\nthis thing powered for two days.\n\n438\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.060\nWe may have the right to be able to go\nin and claim that, and say, guess what?\n\n439\n00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.580\nWe got to search it without a warrant\n\n440\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.940\nbecause the data would have\ndisappeared otherwise.\n\n441\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.180\nWill evidence be removed or\ndestroyed, as we talked about.\n\n442\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.590\nRight, so, again, these are things you\nwant to think about and be aware of.\n\n443\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.560\nI've talked about\nthe plain view exception.\n\n444\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.890\nThis is the idea of evidence being\nin plain view, walk up on the desk,\n\n445\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.100\nto your point earlier.\n\n446\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.190\nUnlock open drawer, right.\n\n447\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.790\nHacker's Bible sitting there or something\nlike that, Anarchist Cookbook, whatever.\n\n448\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.250\nThen I've got a little slightly\ndifferent interpretation of that.\n\n449\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.570\nThen I walk up and there a locked drawer,\nright, and I have no idea what's in it.\n\n450\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.350\nIf I see smoke coming out of the drawer,\nthen that's a different set\n\n451\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.980\nof circumstances,\nthat's exigent circumstances.\n\n452\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.180\nNot in plain view.\n\n453\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.430\nBut if it's open and I see, hey, a copy\nof confidential data, marked confidential\n\n454\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.640\nsitting there, that's in plain view,\nI've got a right to deal with that.\n\n455\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.950\nSo, plain view exception, important.\n\n456\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.940\nSearch incident to a lawful arrest,\nwe talked about this.\n\n457\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.480\nThey arrest you, let's just be\nclear about this unequivocally.\n\n458\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.890\nYou've got nothing at that point.\n\n459\n00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.850\nAnything you're carrying with you,\nlaw enforcement agency has the right\n\n460\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.970\nto take it out of your pockets, examine,\nopen up your backpack, you name it.\n\n461\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.670\nThere's no private property at that point.\n\n462\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.410\nThey can take whatever they want,\nlook at it,\n\n463\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.610\nexamine it,\nmake sure they know what you have.\n\n464\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.990\nSo when we think about that, full search\nof an individual when arrested, as well as\n\n465\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.460\na limited search of the surroundings\nwithout a warrant, according to the law.\n\n466\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.700\nNow, surroundings are relative.\n\n467\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.130\nYou get pulled out of a car, get arrested,\n\n468\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.610\nthey can search the car by\nlooking at what's in plain view.\n\n469\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.680\nBut if they want to open the trunk and\ngo do an invasive search,\n\n470\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.670\nthey got to get a warrant to be\nable to do that to do it legally.\n\n471\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.630\nBut if they pull you over, arrest you,\npull you out of that car, and\n\n472\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.335\nthere's a gun in plain view,\nthey're gonna take that car apart.\n\n473\n00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:33.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n474\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.520\nwhether they have a warrant or not.\n\n475\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.090\nBecause now they have probable\ncause to think that you may have\n\n476\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.910\nother firearms that could pose\na safety hazard to them and to others.\n\n477\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.030\nYou may be smuggling drugs,\nwho knows what you're doing, right?\n\n478\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.820\nUnless you can prove that firearm\nis a legitimately licensed weapon\n\n479\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.010\nthat belongs to you, and was being\ndealt with in the appropriate way,\n\n480\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.490\nthey're going to tear that car\napart with or without a warrant.\n\n481\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.430\nAnd so you've got to understand that a lot\nof these things depend on circumstance.\n\n482\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.730\nAnd you want to be aware of that and\nhave a sense of that.\n\n483\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.930\nSo understand that.\n\n484\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.760\n&gt;&gt; Adam, how does things like, and\nthis might be off topic as well, but\n\n485\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.050\nwe're having such a good time with it.\n\n486\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.440\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; What about like the dog?\n\n487\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.200\nThey'll bring a dog and\nwill sniff around the car.\n\n488\n00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.270\n&gt;&gt; Drug searches with dogs.\n\n489\n00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.820\nSure, absolutely.\n\n490\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.730\n&gt;&gt; If a dog queues, then they have\nprobably cause, is that right?\n\n491\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.470\n&gt;&gt; So, attention, right?\n\n492\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.806\nSo you see this at airports a lot of time,\nbut\n\n493\n00:22:16.806 --> 00:22:18.950\nseeing is a lot of reason when\nI've been traveling, right?\n\n494\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.160\nSo, you're, especially if we go\nto international airports, right?\n\n495\n00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.987\nComing in and out of customs, like Miami,\ncoming in and out of Fort Lauderdale,\n\n496\n00:22:26.987 --> 00:22:28.235\nplaces like that.\n\n497\n00:22:28.235 --> 00:22:29.615\nSo yeah, they've got the drug dogs and\n\n498\n00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:33.145\na lot of times you'll see them\nin the luggage area in customs.\n\n499\n00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:37.355\nThey're just walking around,\nthe border officers with the dogs, and\n\n500\n00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:38.835\nthey're just kind of sniffing\nthrough the luggage.\n\n501\n00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:41.105\nThey're not looking for anything in\nparticular, but what they're looking for\n\n502\n00:22:41.105 --> 00:22:42.775\nis the dog to essentially cue.\n\n503\n00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:45.815\nWhen that happens,\nthen they have probably cause.\n\n504\n00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:48.190\nSo they can at that point say\nhey by the way, guess what?\n\n505\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.680\nThat belongs to you, you and\nthe bag follow us, right.\n\n506\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.440\nNow we're going to sit down and\nhave a little chat.\n\n507\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.710\nSo yeah, if they bring the dog out and\nthe dog sniffs something,\n\n508\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.630\nthen they have the right to\nthen stop you and question you.\n\n509\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.900\nThey may or may not have the right to\nsearch you thoroughly without a warrant.\n\n510\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.590\nBecause invasive searches\nbased on probable cause\n\n511\n00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.320\nmay be considered illegal\nwithout a warrant under certain\n\n512\n00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.250\ncircumstances according\nto the fourth amendment.\n\n513\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.940\nAgain, it's considered to be\na case by case contextual basis.\n\n514\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Things like dogs that are trained to\n\n515\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.460\ncue on certain things are seen as being\nindicative of behavior that may be\n\n516\n00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.960\nrequiring further follow-up.\n\n517\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.980\nThey may hold you in a cell and get a\nwarrant before they tear your bags apart.\n\n518\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.760\nBut once they get that warrant, they got\nthe right to look at anything they want.\n\n519\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.310\n&gt;&gt; It's on.\n\n520\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.980\n&gt;&gt; It's on, full cavity body search.\n\n521\n00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The whole nine yards, right,\n\n522\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.670\nso\n&gt;&gt; You really got to think about that.\n\n523\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.790\nIt comes down to that point to the law\nenforcement officer's training,\n\n524\n00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.230\nunderstanding kind of where\nthey are with that boundary.\n\n525\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.910\nWhether they feel that search may\nrequire a warrant because it's going to\n\n526\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.080\nbe invasive.\n\n527\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.930\nAnd if it is,\nthey will typically take the time\n\n528\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.395\nto simply get the warrant if they\ncan secure you and the evidence,\n\n529\n00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:55.970\nbecause having you sit in a cell for\n8 hours is no skin off their nose, right?\n\n530\n00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.921\nThey just don't care\n&gt;&gt; They'll get to you when they get to\n\n531\n00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:59.087\nyou when the judge signs the warrant.\n\n532\n00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:01.138\nThey just have to show\nprobable cause to the judge.\n\n533\n00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:02.691\nThe judge will give them a warrant.\n\n534\n00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.299\nThen they can go do whatever they want.\n\n535\n00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:08.563\nBut if there again, with exigent\ncircumstance, are afraid that you're\n\n536\n00:24:08.563 --> 00:24:13.040\ngonna destroy evidence by waiting,\nthey will typically take action.\n\n537\n00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.450\nAnd when they then find something,\nthey may stop at that point,\n\n538\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.280\nsecure it, get a warrant to do further\nfollow ups to ensure that whatever else\n\n539\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.280\nthey find will then be legal.\n\n540\n00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.660\nBecause the problem\nbecomes it's poisonous,\n\n541\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.700\nit's what's called fruit\nof the poisonous tree.\n\n542\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.145\nRight so, if you find the initial\nevidence under a probable cause,\n\n543\n00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:35.240\nexigent circumstance search, but\nit was considered to be invasive and\n\n544\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.820\nthen you find after that is\nthe result is no longer valid.\n\n545\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.250\nBut if you can prove that through probable\ncause and incidence circumstance, you\n\n546\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.090\nfound something, you stopped and secured\nit, you got a warrant to follow up and\n\n547\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.850\nhad full rights to search, everything you\nget at that point is considered legal.\n\n548\n00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.650\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n549\n00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.480\n&gt;&gt; So it's one of those things again that\nyou gotta go back and forth around, right?\n\n550\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.890\nSo inventory searches.\n\n551\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.050\nTalked about this as a category as well.\n\n552\n00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.320\nAre considered reasonable,\nproviding that meet two criteria.\n\n553\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.080\nSo it's important to understand\nwhat the criteria are.\n\n554\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.610\nThe search must serve a legitimate\nnon- investigatory purpose,\n\n555\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.720\noutweighing the intrusion on\nthe individual's fourth amendment rights.\n\n556\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.380\nAnd the search must follow\nstandardized procedures.\n\n557\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.350\nIn other words, if I go to search\ninventory as an agent, and\n\n558\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.970\nI am searching it and\nI'm targeting something very specific, and\n\n559\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.680\nI'm not doing it broadly and I'm searching\neverything and I'm not searching in\n\n560\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.190\na standardized way, but\nI'm throwing everything off the shelf and\n\n561\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.770\nI'm focusing on one-\n&gt;&gt; You're searching coffee beans for\n\n562\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.448\nbags of cocaine.\n\n563\n00:25:28.448 --> 00:25:29.280\nWell cuz.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n564\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's typical.\n\n565\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.871\n&gt;&gt; I can search I can do that right,\n\n566\n00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:35.126\nbut the issue is ultimately\nthat I have to search in\n\n567\n00:25:35.126 --> 00:25:38.394\na standardized way.\nI have to follow a standardized procedure\n\n568\n00:25:38.394 --> 00:25:41.795\nand I have to search in a way that does\nnot intrude on the individual's fourth\n\n569\n00:25:41.795 --> 00:25:44.590\namendment rights.\nI can't single out one individual and\n\n570\n00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.940\nsearch them differently than I\ndo anybody else, for instance.\n\n571\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.530\nSo I couldn't stand you up\nagainst the wall in the corner,\n\n572\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.630\ntake a look at everything you have in your\npockets, make you empty your backpack, and\n\n573\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.280\nthen just look at everybody else as they\nwalk by and go yeah, no they're okay.\n\n574\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.300\nRight, that would not be appropriate.\n\n575\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.821\n&gt;&gt; It's not cool, it's just not cool.\n\n576\n00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:03.726\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not cool.\n\n577\n00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:04.950\nSo we can't do that.\n\n578\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.080\nBut we can treat everybody equally.\n\n579\n00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.540\nSo, this is why they walk around with\n\n580\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.350\nthe dogs,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n581\n00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.830\n&gt;&gt; And they don't target one individual,\n\n582\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.500\nthey walk around, what seemingly is\nrandomly, but they have a purpose, right?\n\n583\n00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They usually have a sense that\n\n584\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.750\nsomething's going on.\n\n585\n00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.420\nThey may have gotten a tip, hey,\nthere's something coming through.\n\n586\n00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.040\nWe don't know exactly when, or where.\n\n587\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.830\nSo, instead of standing,\nwaiting on what they think is the target,\n\n588\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.890\nthey're gonna walk around, kinda,\njust checking, in general,\n\n589\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:33.150\nknowing that 99% of those activities\nwere just basically waste of time.\n\n590\n00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.030\nBut if they were just to\ntarget one individual, right?\n\n591\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.020\nThen essentially at that point\nit becomes an issue of hey,\n\n592\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.480\nwe singled you out, you may actually\nbe able to say that this was unfair.\n\n593\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.456\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Even thought we found you with\n\n594\n00:26:44.456 --> 00:26:46.051\na thousand keys of cocaine.\n\n595\n00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:46.968\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Guess what,\n\n596\n00:26:46.968 --> 00:26:47.713\nyou get to walk out the door.\n\n597\n00:26:47.713 --> 00:26:48.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n598\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.770\nSo instead,\nthey will walk around the airport.\n\n599\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.470\nThe dogs just sniffing around and\nby the way, I will go and\n\n600\n00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.350\ncheck this other person over here as well,\nknowing that's the person we wanna target.\n\n601\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:02.260\nBut since we've essentially checked\neverybody, we're not singling you out.\n\n602\n00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.161\nIt's classified as being legitimate,\nunder an inventory search clause,\n\n603\n00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:06.580\ncuz we're not singling you out.\n\n604\n00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.860\n&gt;&gt; Does that leads us into\nthen our border searchers?\n\n605\n00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.200\nWe're kind of.\n\n606\n00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.923\nCome to the hint thing that way.\n\n607\n00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:13.470\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n608\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.217\nWell although, so from the border search\nperspective, it's a little bit different.\n\n609\n00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:18.630\nSo border search is.\n\n610\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.102\nSo the US Supreme Court,\nas they have in many areas,\n\n611\n00:27:21.102 --> 00:27:25.150\nhas held that routine searches do not, do\nnot require a warrant, probable cause, or\n\n612\n00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.370\neven reasonable suspicion to\nbe carried out on the boarder.\n\n613\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.010\nEssentially, if you go through\na border check-point, into or\n\n614\n00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.180\nout of the US, we have the right\nto strip you buck naked and\n\n615\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.960\nhold you until we figure out what we\nwanna find and whether you have it.\n\n616\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.600\nAnd we don't have to prove anything other\nthan the fact that it was Tuesday and\n\n617\n00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.580\nwe decided you were the lucky candidate.\n\n618\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.610\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fun.\n\n619\n00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n620\n00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.660\n&gt;&gt; Now, how is that not\na violation of the 4th Amendment?\n\n621\n00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.864\nHow do they?\n\n622\n00:27:49.864 --> 00:27:53.838\n&gt;&gt; So because it has to do with border\nsecurity, and because you are coming and\n\n623\n00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:54.730\ngoing, right?\n\n624\n00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.700\nYou are subject to essentially,\n\n625\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.010\nthe expectation that we have\nthe right to secure our border.\n\n626\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.310\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm just stating this,\nI'm not saying it's right or wrong.\n\n627\n00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.350\nI'm just saying, what it seems to, is the\nUnited State's Government has deemed that\n\n628\n00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.450\nyou-\n&gt;&gt; Not the United States Government,\n\n629\n00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.580\nUS Supreme Court.\n\n630\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.230\n&gt;&gt; The Supreme Court.\n\n631\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.735\n&gt;&gt; The Supreme Court has held that\nroutine searches, a normal search.\n\n632\n00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:17.202\nMeaning, a normal search, hey you're\ndriving through we're gonna search your\n\n633\n00:28:17.202 --> 00:28:21.775\ncar, we're gonna ask you some questions,\nwe're gonna take your picture right?\n\n634\n00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:24.910\nCuz you know everybody coming and going\nyou're gonna have a facial recognition\n\n635\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.060\nsystem running,\nwe're gonna check your passport or\n\n636\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.880\nwhatever your government issued ID will\nbe, all the things we do routinely, right?\n\n637\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.442\nNo warrant,\n\n638\n00:28:31.442 --> 00:28:34.773\nno probable cause, not even reasonable\nsuspicion, we can set those rules.\n\n639\n00:28:34.773 --> 00:28:37.759\nNow, if we're gonna do an invasive and\nintrusive search,\n\n640\n00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:41.190\nwe have to have only what is\ncalled reasonable suspicion.\n\n641\n00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.500\nReasonable suspicions is,\n\n642\n00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.990\nhey you know what, that Daniel guy,\nhe's got short hair.\n\n643\n00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Don't like those guys.\n\n644\n00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.880\n&gt;&gt; We just think short hair is a problem,\nwe gotta search a little more carefully,\n\n645\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.090\nbecause he fits the profile for something\nwe may think short hair people do.\n\n646\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.800\nWhatever that means.\n\n647\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\ndon't they call that profiling nowadays?\n\n648\n00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.070\n&gt;&gt; No, they call that reasonable\nsuspicion, so that's not breaking the law.\n\n649\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.545\nThat's exactly what they call it.\n\n650\n00:29:01.545 --> 00:29:02.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the court has held that on\n\n651\n00:29:02.888 --> 00:29:04.910\nthe border, and\nagain we're talking about the border.\n\n652\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.695\n&gt;&gt; On the border.\n\n653\n00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:06.442\nSpecifically.\n\n654\n00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:09.490\n&gt;&gt; This a very specifically\ndefined geographic region.\n\n655\n00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.300\nWe're not talking about you\nbeing stopped on the street.\n\n656\n00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right.\n\n657\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.900\nWe call that profiling when it's just\nbeing done randomly in the middle\n\n658\n00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.320\nof your normal daily\nroutine where you live.\n\n659\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.190\nAnd that's unacceptable and by the way\nit's against the law, just to be clear.\n\n660\n00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.890\nIt's not acceptable to do that.\n\n661\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.950\nBut having said that, on the border,\ncoming and going, when we're dealing with\n\n662\n00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.680\npeople that are transiting and And or\nmaterial goods are coming and going.\n\n663\n00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.620\nWe have the right, according to the\nSupreme Court in the United States, and\n\n664\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.790\nof course the Federal Government\nbacks this up and\n\n665\n00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.850\nsets up the border security and\nall the stuff to go with this, and\n\n666\n00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:45.340\ndoes this as a result, to search\nreasonably, without any justification.\n\n667\n00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.450\nIf it's going to be a intrusive search,\n\n668\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.540\nwe just have to have what we\ncall reasonable suspicion.\n\n669\n00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.650\nYou look like you may be\nsomebody that we want to talk to.\n\n670\n00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.700\nAnd we have the right to pull you out and\nspend time with you, and\n\n671\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.800\nbe more investigative and\ndeeper in our discussions.\n\n672\n00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.230\nAnd may even hold you for a period of\ntime until we can validate whether or\n\n673\n00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.250\nnot you pose a threat.\n\n674\n00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.100\nThis is why when you get pulled out of\na line going through immigration, or\n\n675\n00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.430\ntrying to get on a plane.\n\n676\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.720\nAnd you're on a no fly list,\nthey'll throw you in a, essentially-\n\n677\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.480\n&gt;&gt; In a tank somewhere.\n\n678\n00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.260\n&gt;&gt; In a tank somewhere.\n\n679\n00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.780\nThey're gonna spend hours\nwith you potentially.\n\n680\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.760\nAnd they can hold you for several days\nwithout anything other than just simply\n\n681\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.610\nsaying, we had reasonable cause to\nthink that you may pose a threat.\n\n682\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n683\n00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.430\n&gt;&gt; And that's not just here by the way,\nthat is in most countries in the world.\n\n684\n00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.550\nMost countries without exception take\nborder security incredibly seriously.\n\n685\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.340\nMeaning that if there is a functional\ngovernment that has the means and\n\n686\n00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.662\nthe ability to secure the border,\nthey will act essentially the same way.\n\n687\n00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:42.740\nThey have the right to say,hey guess what\nyou don't look like you belong here and\n\n688\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.098\nyou may not like me saying that, but\n\n689\n00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:46.329\nthe bottom line is,\nyou don't look like you belong here.\n\n690\n00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:50.332\nWe either are gonna have a chat about\nwhether you get to come in here or not.\n\n691\n00:30:50.332 --> 00:30:51.712\nOr you're not coming in.\n\n692\n00:30:51.712 --> 00:30:54.602\nAnd that's essentially what\nthe courts have interpreted\n\n693\n00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:55.992\nour ability to do on the border.\n\n694\n00:30:55.992 --> 00:30:56.912\nSo we don't need a warrant.\n\n695\n00:30:56.912 --> 00:30:58.902\nWe don't need anything other\nthan reasonable cause.\n\n696\n00:30:58.902 --> 00:31:01.117\nAnd reasonable cause is\nan incredibly sticky, elastic term.\n\n697\n00:31:01.117 --> 00:31:03.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes it is.\n&gt;&gt; That essentially means,\n\n698\n00:31:03.002 --> 00:31:06.302\nwe decided we want to talk to you, so\nyou're gonna go sit in a room over there\n\n699\n00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:08.092\nuntil we decide that we\nwanna spend time with you.\n\n700\n00:31:08.092 --> 00:31:10.863\n&gt;&gt; Whatever seems reasonable to us,\nbasically, is what it comes down to.\n\n701\n00:31:10.863 --> 00:31:11.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n702\n00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.300\nAnd then we're not reasonable, so\nyou're not gonna have a fun time.\n\n703\n00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.550\nInternational issues\nare on these list as well.\n\n704\n00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.850\nSo international issues,\nwe have to deal with treaties.\n\n705\n00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.210\nCan we go to my machine for\n\n706\n00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.160\na minute, I wanted to actually\nshow you this particular one.\n\n707\n00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.820\nYou'll see on the screen there,\nthis is the Council of Europe.\n\n708\n00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.740\nSo the Council of Europe cyber crime\nconvention completed in 2001 treaties you\n\n709\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.430\ncould see there number 185.\n\n710\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.479\nObligates all signatory staff\nthe ability to effect cross\n\n711\n00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:38.657\nborder preservation requests.\n\n712\n00:31:38.657 --> 00:31:44.303\nMeaning, essentially anybody who signed on\nto this treaty has the responsibility and\n\n713\n00:31:44.303 --> 00:31:49.253\nthe obligation to honor a request from\nanother treaty signatory to preserve\n\n714\n00:31:49.253 --> 00:31:53.830\nevidence in their country under\ncertain defined conditions.\n\n715\n00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.750\nSo if we've signed on as the United\nStates, and Germany is signed on,\n\n716\n00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.800\nif Germany says to us,\nhey that Daniel guy.\n\n717\n00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.171\nYeah, we think he's up to no good.\n\n718\n00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:03.257\nSeize his computer and\nhold it as evidence, and\n\n719\n00:32:03.257 --> 00:32:05.501\nwe're sending you the paper\nwork to support that,\n\n720\n00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:08.808\nthe US government has act on that behalf,\nthen come and get your computer.\n\n721\n00:32:08.808 --> 00:32:10.691\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's very interesting.\n\n722\n00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:11.575\nWow.\n\n723\n00:32:11.575 --> 00:32:12.698\nSo let's take a look at this real quick.\n\n724\n00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:14.226\nCan we go full screen so\nyou could see this,\n\n725\n00:32:14.226 --> 00:32:15.891\ncuz there's some\ninteresting stuff in here.\n\n726\n00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:19.130\nSo, we've got the URL for this,\nDaniel is gonna have that for you.\n\n727\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.410\nI set it up so you see the full list\nof the treaty, but take a look,\n\n728\n00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:23.700\nConvention on Cybercrime.\n\n729\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.575\nWhere it was signed,\nthe text are in what languages.\n\n730\n00:32:27.575 --> 00:32:29.170\nYou've got the signatories here,\n\n731\n00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.500\nwhich means it will tell you all\nthe parties that have signed it.\n\n732\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.880\nSo you can figure that out.\n\n733\n00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.940\nIt's got the explanatory report.\n\n734\n00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.920\nIt's also got the website for the Budapest\nConvention which is, what's behind this.\n\n735\n00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.690\nSo you could actually get\nall the information here.\n\n736\n00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.950\nAnd you know, if you wanted to, you can\ngo in and see who the signatories are.\n\n737\n00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.940\nSo you could click here.\n\n738\n00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:50.220\nAnd you'll see all\nthe countries that have signed.\n\n739\n00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.360\nIt's alphabetical.\n\n740\n00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.690\nSo you'll see here, Just scrolling down.\n\n741\n00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.910\nRight, you've also got non-members\nof the Council of Europe.\n\n742\n00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.670\nSo you've got Canada, you've got Columbia,\nCosta Rica, the Dominican Republic, Japan,\n\n743\n00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.210\nIsrael, Ghana.\n\n744\n00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.960\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Keep going,\n\n745\n00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.280\nUnited States is there, right?\n\n746\n00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.200\n&gt;&gt; Ghana.\n[LAUGH]\n\n747\n00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n748\n00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.795\nthey're just always up to no good, right?\n\n749\n00:33:11.795 --> 00:33:12.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n750\n00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.600\nyou could see that we've got,\nright, ourselves, United States,\n\n751\n00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.430\nhas signed onto this and as a result, we\nare bound by requests from treaty nations,\n\n752\n00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.925\nand we're bound to support them\nlike they're bound to support us.\n\n753\n00:33:23.925 --> 00:33:24.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n754\n00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.140\n&gt;&gt; So again we'd have to know\nabout this and be aware of this.\n\n755\n00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.170\nAs an investigator, these\nare the kinda things we wanna be aware\n\n756\n00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:33.390\nbecause this may impact our ability\nto do our job cross border.\n\n757\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.400\n&gt;&gt; Right cuz this could work\nin our favor as well, right?\n\n758\n00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.620\nIf we had someone that fled from the US.\n\n759\n00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.530\nJumped over to one of these countries\nthat have signed this type of treaty,\n\n760\n00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.730\nthen we could say, hey,\nwe had a guy, he took off.\n\n761\n00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.190\nHe said, your land,\nyou could do us a favor.\n\n762\n00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.350\nGo grab him up for me.\n\n763\n00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.290\n&gt;&gt; Or we could send you across the border,\nsubject to a reasonable search.\n\n764\n00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And say for you to go get him.\n\n765\n00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.530\nBut that may not end well for you.\n\n766\n00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, we could do that.\n\n767\n00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.140\nObviously, that would be one of\nthe things we could do with this.\n\n768\n00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n769\n00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, we have definitely really,\nthis is probably one of those things that\n\n770\n00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:06.130\nget really fun, should I say,\nheeded me even really, really quickly.\n\n771\n00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:11.010\nBut, it is the law, and as a CHFI,\nyou gotta know what it is that you could\n\n772\n00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.100\ndo when it comes to searching, seizing,\ngetting evidence, gathering it up.\n\n773\n00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.970\nWhat are your rights?\n\n774\n00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.980\nWhat our their rights of the person\nyou're trying to investigate, so\n\n775\n00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.395\nthat you don't make not things\ninvisible in court as we like.\n\n776\n00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:25.360\nWe wanna be able to take\nthe evidence that we find and\n\n777\n00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.770\nactually use it to our benefit\nwhen it comes to a court case.\n\n778\n00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.810\n&gt;&gt; But the Law of the United States,\nit was been focus primarily.\n\n779\n00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; It's important,\n\n780\n00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.740\njust remind you of that\nbecause as I said and\n\n781\n00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.420\nI will continue to remind you\nthrough at the time together.\n\n782\n00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.030\nWe are interpreting this discussion and\n\n783\n00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.220\nshowing this to you almost\nwith that exception.\n\n784\n00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.110\nFrom the perspective of US Federal Law,\nfederal rules of evidence, US statutory\n\n785\n00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.300\nLaw and as a result, what an investigator\nin the US would be bound to do or\n\n786\n00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.370\nnot be able to do based on\ninterpretation of that.\n\n787\n00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.690\nEvery country may see this\nslightly differently and\n\n788\n00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.160\nyou have to understand if you're sitting\nin anywhere, doesn't matter where,\n\n789\n00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.230\noutside the boundary of the United States.\n\n790\n00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.430\nSubject to the country's law you're in.\n\n791\n00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.400\nYou have to filter this information\nthrough the lens and the expectation of\n\n792\n00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.530\nwhat that particular set of legal\nrequirements and frameworks will be.\n\n793\n00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.450\nWhether it's the council in Europe, which\nyou saw, with regards to cyber security\n\n794\n00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.720\nand the treaty on being able to do this or\nall the other things that exist.\n\n795\n00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.360\nAnd this becomes,\n\n796\n00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.300\nas we said, even bigger when we add\ncloud computing into the mix and\n\n797\n00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.170\ndo a cross-border GO Preference hosting\nand all the things that go on there.\n\n798\n00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.740\nThis becomes a very,\nvery big complicated, what is it?\n\n799\n00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.726\nThe, my daughter always says.\n\n800\n00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:34.651\nHot mess, right?\n\n801\n00:35:34.651 --> 00:35:36.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A big hot mess, right?\n\n802\n00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.830\nThat's what the kids are saying today.\n\n803\n00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's it.\n\n804\n00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.320\n&gt;&gt; Trying to be the cool cyber dad.\n\n805\n00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.925\n&gt;&gt; You're relevant.\n\n806\n00:35:40.925 --> 00:35:42.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am relevant, I am.\n\n807\n00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.450\nThat's a really scary thought.\n\n808\n00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:49.810\nSo you know, it becomes a really big issue\nand something that you, and all of us, but\n\n809\n00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.990\nyou, whoever's listening to this,\nhave to interpret for yourself.\n\n810\n00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.674\nRemember, becoming CHFI,\nyou to take the CHFI exam.\n\n811\n00:35:55.674 --> 00:35:59.240\nIt's gonna be based on the concepts\nthat we're going through and\n\n812\n00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.790\ntalking about within the confines\nof our material here.\n\n813\n00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.140\nMeaning, if we talk about the perspective\nof US federal law and the rules\n\n814\n00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.765\nof evidence, that's gonna be information\nthat's gonna be important for you.\n\n815\n00:36:08.765 --> 00:36:12.330\nWe're not expecting you to understand\nwhat the federal requirements are for\n\n816\n00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.440\nevidence in Germany, right?\n\n817\n00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.650\nBecause you're probably not\ngonna get tested on that.\n\n818\n00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.300\nBut, I'm making the point that you\nshould be aware of it in the real\n\n819\n00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.410\nworld beyond exam preparation\nbecause it's important for\n\n820\n00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.830\nyou to understand that if you go out and\nactually do this,\n\n821\n00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.462\nthat it may not be a U.S. centric position\nyou're asked to be involved with.\n\n822\n00:36:27.462 --> 00:36:30.470\nAnd maybe an Israeli position,\nor a Canadian position.\n\n823\n00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.430\nAlthough the Canadian position is often\nvery closely aligned with the US.\n\n824\n00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.990\nBut it could be any country.\n\n825\n00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.750\nAnd that may or\nmay not be aligned with the US.\n\n826\n00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.340\nAnd so you just wanna remember\nthat as we continue to wrap up.\n\n827\n00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.340\nAnd I didn't mean to interrupt you.\n\n828\n00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.970\nBut it's a very important point to make.\n\n829\n00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.220\nWe often make it at the beginning.\n\n830\n00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.110\nAnd I think it's great to make it here as\nwe're wrapping up and summarizing again.\n\n831\n00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's always good to book end\nthose important distinctions that we need\n\n832\n00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.840\nto keep in mind.\n\n833\n00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.050\nSo we're filtering this\ninformation correctly.\n\n834\n00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.780\nThat being said,\nI know we've got more to go through.\n\n835\n00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.595\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; We're not done with that.\n\n836\n00:36:56.595 --> 00:36:58.920\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] We're going to three,\nnumber three.\n\n837\n00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.400\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; We look forward to seeing\n\n838\n00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.080\nyou there as well.\n\n839\n00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.770\nAdam, thank you so much for\nstopping by on this episode.\n\n840\n00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.770\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPROTV.\n\n841\n00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.681\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n842\n00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:11.985\n&gt;&gt; I'm Tres.\n\n843\n00:37:11.985 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.781\nWelcome to ITProTV, I'm your host Don\nPezet [CROSSTALK] coming at you live from\n\n2\n00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:07.092\nSan Francisco, California [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:08.269\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.220\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.954\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:15.950\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.900\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.150\nin today's episode we're back\nwith more of our CHFI content.\n\n9\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.160\nAnd joining us for part three on search\nand seizure, our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.770\nAdam Gordan.\n\n11\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.640\nAdam welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.020\n&gt;&gt; S and S, search and seizure.\n\n13\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.430\n&gt;&gt; That's right S and S.\n\n14\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding.\n\n15\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.930\nAll right let's get down to it.\n\n16\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.450\nI've got some searching and\nsome seizing I wanna do.\n\n17\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.546\nSo we're continuing our conversations\nwith regards to search and seizure.\n\n18\n00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.970\nWe went through in our last discussion,\npretty interesting,\n\n19\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.080\na little bit lengthy as Daniel and\nI were just talking about.\n\n20\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.100\nBut worth your time,\nif you haven't seen it.\n\n21\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.628\nPlease take a look at it, it's gonna have\nsome real good information there for\n\n22\n00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:51.889\nyou with regards to the ways in which\nwe deal with warrantless searches in\n\n23\n00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:53.560\nsome exemptions on what we got to do.\n\n24\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.499\nWanna continue that thing, we talked\na little bit about workplace searching,\n\n25\n00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.494\nalready Daniel and I went through and\ntalked about this in episode, our show 1,\n\n26\n00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.642\nepisode 1, 5, 7?\n\n27\n00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:03.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, somewhere in there.\n\n28\n00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.899\n&gt;&gt; What do we call it, so\nthe first part of this.\n\n29\n00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:05.462\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Part 1,\n\n30\n00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:06.634\nthere we go, that's what we call it.\n\n31\n00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:10.438\nSo part 1, we've talked a bit\nabout workplace searches,\n\n32\n00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.415\nwhat we call special\nhandling instructions.\n\n33\n00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.239\nGotta make sure we understand the concepts\nof public versus private space,\n\n34\n00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.050\nwe've been through that and\ntalked a little bit about that with you.\n\n35\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.641\nTalked about the idea of preexisting\npolicies with regards to how we manage\n\n36\n00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:23.788\nthat in the workplace.\n\n37\n00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:27.230\nRight, the private workplace is treated\nunder the same rules as the home.\n\n38\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.670\nSo if you have you an office and\nyou're able to close the door.\n\n39\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.580\nAnd you've got a little\nprivate area there.\n\n40\n00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.100\nSomebody has to grant rights\nto that to be searched.\n\n41\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.020\nSo, yeah, you have to say yeah,\nit's okay to come in and search that.\n\n42\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.370\nIt's private space, but we can get around\nthat by getting consent from a party\n\n43\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.680\nthat is the common manager\nas we've talked about.\n\n44\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.035\nSo in my examples we said if Daniel was\nacting as a central representative of\n\n45\n00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:52.400\nITProTV, could give us the right\nto come in and search.\n\n46\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.490\nThat would essentially allow\nus to search even though\n\n47\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.820\nI may not be there to grant them\nrights to search my office.\n\n48\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.295\nSo we gotta think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n49\n00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:03.310\nPre-existing policies\nauthorizing a search.\n\n50\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.790\nIf the search is work-related,\n\n51\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.890\ncan be done without the need to\nseek the consent of the individual.\n\n52\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.850\nSo again we wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n53\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.230\nA lot of times,\nwe will do these searches after hours or\n\n54\n00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.280\nbefore hours when the people that\nwe are targeting may not be around.\n\n55\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.980\nSo they're not aware of\nthe fact that we're doing this,\n\n56\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.190\nso again something to think about\nunder that particular thought process.\n\n57\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.870\nSearching and seizing a computer with a\nwarrant, obviously a little bit different\n\n58\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.500\nin the sense that we wanna understand,\nwanna know.\n\n59\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.600\nThat when we do use a warrant, we are\nformally serving notice that we're going\n\n60\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.770\nto take that information and/or\nclaim that computer for ourselves.\n\n61\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.560\nSo when we do that, it's a little\nbit harder to hide our activity.\n\n62\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.900\nYou can't say, hey, Daniel,\ngo out and get us some lunch.\n\n63\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.750\nCome back, there won't be a computer\nhere because we're gonna serve you with\n\n64\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.920\na warrant and say, by the way,\nwe want that computer.\n\n65\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.180\nSo we gotta be aware of that and\nthink about that, as well.\n\n66\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.510\nKeys to success,\nwith regards to this, right?\n\n67\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.730\nKnowledgable team experts, if you're gonna\nsearch with a warrant, you got to have\n\n68\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.530\na team of experts to help you understand\nwhat it is you're looking for.\n\n69\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.130\nHow to define the moving parts that you\nhave to declare and essentially provide\n\n70\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.680\nto the court to get a warrant which is\nthe affidavit and the warrant itself.\n\n71\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.165\nAnd we'll talk about these\ntwo parts in a little bit.\n\n72\n00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:14.165\nThe affidavit is the statement\nthat you're gonna provide\n\n73\n00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:17.485\nthat essentially stipulates the facts that\nyou're seeking to get the warrant under.\n\n74\n00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:18.845\nAnd then the warrant itself.\n\n75\n00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:22.065\nKnowledge and\nknowing the target prior to searching, so\n\n76\n00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:25.615\nhaving background information,\nreconning and doing our\n\n77\n00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:28.865\ninformation gathering to understand the\nextent of what it is we're looking to do.\n\n78\n00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:31.965\nHave a backup plan if things\ndon't go as advertised.\n\n79\n00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:33.590\nAnd pay attention to details.\n\n80\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.440\nNecessary to draft the warrant\nsuccessfully, and again,\n\n81\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.160\nwe're gonna talk more about this and\nwhat this relates to\n\n82\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.900\nwith regards to setting up our warrant and\nour affidavit in a little bit here.\n\n83\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.946\nSearch strategies are important for\nus and we talked a lot about these,\n\n84\n00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:48.928\nthinking about them.\n\n85\n00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:53.918\nYet when I asked somebody, hey what are we\ngonna do, what are we gonna look for,\n\n86\n00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.942\nwhat's our plan, I expect to\nhear something that makes sense,\n\n87\n00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:01.390\nI expect to hear that we have\na thought process in mind.\n\n88\n00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.990\nHey we're gonna go search that computer.\n\n89\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.590\nWe're looking for\nevidence of this or that.\n\n90\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.410\nWe're gonna look for files.\n\n91\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.740\nWell what if those files aren't there?\n\n92\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.280\nWell, we're gonna have forensic\ncapabilities to recover them.\n\n93\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.125\nAnd this is one of the things we\nhave to think about and be aware of.\n\n94\n00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.725\nProbably good time for us to show\nthe kind folk out there in ITProTV land,\n\n95\n00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:19.996\nhow we search for files that may\nnot be on its system any longer.\n\n96\n00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:21.815\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] demonstration.\n\n97\n00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:23.505\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, we like demos here in ITProTV.\n\n98\n00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:24.602\n&gt;&gt; Demonstration.\n\n99\n00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:26.432\nSo, we love to show and tell, right?\n\n100\n00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.352\nMore show, less tell.\n\n101\n00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:28.272\nGo for it.\n\n102\n00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Or, okay, yeah.\n\n103\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we're just, yeah.\n\n104\n00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:33.202\nAnyway, so let's go.\n\n105\n00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:34.072\nRight.\n\n106\n00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:34.622\nDo the computer.\n\n107\n00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:37.492\nSo, I thought it would be cool as part of\nour conversation to show you a little bit\n\n108\n00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:40.644\nabout what happens when we show up and\nwe say, hey, we got a plan.\n\n109\n00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:43.382\nWe wanna search for those files but you\nknow what, they're not on the computer.\n\n110\n00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:46.312\nWell, you know what, they probably are but\nthey're just there and you can't see them.\n\n111\n00:04:46.312 --> 00:04:48.102\nSo we have tools that help\nus to figure this out.\n\n112\n00:04:48.102 --> 00:04:51.020\nWe're gonna do this, and\nI'm gonna show you how this may be done.\n\n113\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.660\nHow does a forensic investigator\npotentially look for\n\n114\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.350\nevidence that's been\nremoved from a computer?\n\n115\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.530\nThere's a couple of different\nways we can do this.\n\n116\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.000\nSo one of the tools we can use is\na tool called Recover My Files.\n\n117\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.550\nYou've seen that short cut sitting on\nmy desktop in some of the other demos.\n\n118\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.729\nWe're gonna go ahead and open this up.\n\n119\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.975\nWhen we do this, we'll just give\nit a second to fire up here.\n\n120\n00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.820\nIt's gonna ask us to make a choice here.\n\n121\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.770\nAre we going to recover files or\ndo we wanna recover an entire hard drive?\n\n122\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.063\nA lot of times somebody\nmay take system files and\n\n123\n00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.080\ndelete them thinking that they are gone.\n\n124\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.555\nBut if we know anything about computers\nand hopefully we have a little bit of\n\n125\n00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:28.330\nknowledge, but you may not know\na lot about how this works.\n\n126\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.648\nBut if you do, you know that deleting\nsomething isn't really deleted, but simply\n\n127\n00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:36.842\nremoves it from the graphical interface,\nunless you delete it in a special way,\n\n128\n00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:40.668\nmeaning you're not just holding down\nthe Shift key and hitting Delete but\n\n129\n00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:44.061\nreally deleting it is a question\nof overriding the drive or wiping\n\n130\n00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:48.590\nthe magnetic resonant data on the drive,\noff in a way that it is not recoverable.\n\n131\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.195\nJust using the delete key, doesn't remove\ndata but removes a reference to in\n\n132\n00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:55.035\nthe file table and\nremoves it from the graphical interface.\n\n133\n00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:59.961\nSo it's there on the drive, we just can't\nsee it because the tools necessary to\n\n134\n00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.990\nsee it don't recognize\nthe data as being there.\n\n135\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.703\nThose kind of situations we can\nrecover from or recover from easily,\n\n136\n00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:07.012\nand that's what most people do,\n\n137\n00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:10.610\nbelieve it or not, they're I deleted\nthe files, it's probably gone.\n\n138\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.960\nWell no.\nYou deleted it, it's there.\n\n139\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.950\nWe just gotta know how to.\n\n140\n00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.300\nYou're gonna make me work\nharder to go find it,\n\n141\n00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.770\nwhich means I'm gonna get really pissed.\n\n142\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And when I do finally find it,\n\n143\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.340\nboy are you in for trouble then.\n\n144\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Nice, you made him angry.\n\n145\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now you made me angry.\n\n146\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.998\n&gt;&gt; It's personal.\n\n147\n00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.412\n&gt;&gt; Let's go take a look at how we do this.\n\n148\n00:06:24.412 --> 00:06:26.080\nSo, I'm gonna click recover files.\n\n149\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.296\nRight, lost deleted emptied from\nrecycle bin, from a program crash.\n\n150\n00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:30.209\nWhatever it may be.\n\n151\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.000\nI love, by the way,\n\n152\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.290\njust before we go do this,\nunder recover drive, accidental format.\n\n153\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.470\nWhen was the last time you\naccidentally formatted a drive?\n\n154\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.774\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe I've ever\naccidentally formatted a drive.\n\n155\n00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:43.058\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's pretty purposeful\nand malicious act, personally,\n\n156\n00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:44.610\nwhen you go to format a drive.\n\n157\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.810\nIf you're not meaning to do it-\n&gt;&gt; They're giving you the benefit of a\n\n158\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.745\ndoubt, they don't want to cast aspersions\n&gt;&gt; He was having a bad day,\n\n159\n00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:51.745\nhe didn't really mean\nto format your drive.\n\n160\n00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.427\nPlease don't take things so personally.\n\n161\n00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:54.761\nCome on, it's just a computer.\n\n162\n00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.475\n[LAUGH] All right, so accidental\nformatting of drives is covered here as\n\n163\n00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.310\nwell but\nwhat we're gonna do is look for file.\n\n164\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.123\nSo we're gonna click on this,\nselect it, Recover File, click Next.\n\n165\n00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:07.647\nWe're then gonna be giving a listing\nof all the volumes that are mounted.\n\n166\n00:07:07.647 --> 00:07:11.677\nNow, I've mounted an M volume here\nwhich is actually a drive image that\n\n167\n00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:15.530\nI've taken for a demo we're gonna\ndo at a certain point later.\n\n168\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.890\nAnd we actually can search that,\nthat's why you're seeing that,\n\n169\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.200\nthat's not normally there.\n\n170\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.390\nNormally you'll have like C and\nE and whatever.\n\n171\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.980\nYou'll notice the C drive's about 130\ngigs, NTFS, got a FAT partition here,\n\n172\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.190\na couple of FAT partitions.\n\n173\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.160\nSo we'll do the C drive,\nnow we'll go ahead, we'll click next.\n\n174\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.690\nNow, search for deleted files,\nrecommended a search for\n\n175\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.570\ndeleted files, then search for\nselected lost folder types.\n\n176\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.000\nLet me show you the difference here.\n\n177\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.820\nSearch for deleted files, just by itself,\ndoes a preformatted standard search.\n\n178\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.150\nSearch, advanced if you will, lets me go\nin and pull out specific filetypes and\n\n179\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.330\nsay hey, guess what?\n\n180\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.920\nI'm looking for, I don't know, an Excel\nspreadsheet, or I'm looking for camera,\n\n181\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.196\nmeaning I'm looking for,\nlet's say, image files.\n\n182\n00:07:55.196 --> 00:08:00.015\nOr I'm looking for AVI files, or iTunes\naudio files, or whatever the case may be.\n\n183\n00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:01.797\nSo I could be very specific, And\n\n184\n00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:04.835\nI can put in a certain\nextension that I'm looking for.\n\n185\n00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:08.122\nWe'll do search for\ndeleted, gonna let that run.\n\n186\n00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:11.590\nAnd just as I said, it does\na precompiled search of standard stuff.\n\n187\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.130\nWe'll see what we come up with here,\nbuilds the free space entries for us,\n\n188\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.920\nshows us what's there,\nput the data into the display,\n\n189\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.710\nwe'll give it a second to finish up.\n\n190\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.240\nAnd then says all searches completed,\nand it shows us,\n\n191\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.040\nnow I haven't removed any data yet, right?\n\n192\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.650\nSo there's really very little here, but\nit shows us that there are some items\n\n193\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.990\nin the Google Chrome browser cache that\nare there that I may be able to look at.\n\n194\n00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.807\nAnd it shows me,\nthere's some stuff in the temp file.\n\n195\n00:08:41.807 --> 00:08:44.710\nNow, this is just stuff that's background\nresident data that's in the system.\n\n196\n00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.310\nThis is not stuff that I've actually\npurposely set up and sought to delete.\n\n197\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.400\nSo let's actually go delete something now,\nand then show you what it actually looks\n\n198\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.310\nlike when we have actually deleted\nsomething, trying to hide it.\n\n199\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.540\nThis is just kind of a baseline,\nwhen we scan the system,\n\n200\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.150\nwe wanna know what's there ahead of time\nand have a sense of what we can exclude.\n\n201\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.608\nSo I often will do this, right, and\nsay okay, you know, on a normal system,\n\n202\n00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:08.004\nnormal Windows build,\nnothing out of the ordinary,\n\n203\n00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:11.063\nI'm just gonna seed a bunch of random\nstuff so I can eliminate that.\n\n204\n00:09:11.063 --> 00:09:13.448\nAnd then I can really focus on\nthe stuff that I wanna find, so\n\n205\n00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:15.380\nlet's see how the tool\nbehaves when we do this.\n\n206\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.080\nSo we're just gonna minimize this for\n\n207\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.900\na second, let's come over here,\nlet's go to the C drive.\n\n208\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.130\nSo I have a folder called\nCHFI Test 1 right here,\n\n209\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.680\ncreated in the root of the C drive.\n\n210\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.220\nAnd in there, I've got two files, I got a\nnew bitmap image, you could see it there,\n\n211\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.260\nI got a new text document, a couple\nof things inside the text document,\n\n212\n00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.120\ngot Hello World.\n\n213\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.743\nIn the new bitmap image, got a little\nitem right there, you could see it.\n\n214\n00:09:39.743 --> 00:09:40.422\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n215\n00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:43.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is,\nI stood up all night, I didn't sit,\n\n216\n00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.360\nI stood up all night to draw that just for\nyou.\n\n217\n00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.672\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you appreciate that,\n\n218\n00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:49.780\nthank you very much,\nthank you for recognizing that.\n\n219\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.600\n&gt;&gt; It was moving.\n\n220\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.516\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:53.046\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I have that there, so\n\n222\n00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:55.044\nlet's go ahead, let's delete that, okay?\n\n223\n00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:59.962\nSo let's go ahead and let's delete that,\nwhoops, hold on one second.\n\n224\n00:10:02.062 --> 00:10:04.450\nProbably helpful if I do\nthat the right way, what?\n\n225\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.463\nOkay, that is ridiculous.\n\n226\n00:10:09.524 --> 00:10:12.605\nYou know, just as I've said before and\nI'll say again.\n\n227\n00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:13.732\n&gt;&gt; You're a horrible hider.\n\n228\n00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:15.392\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a horrible hider,\n\n229\n00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:17.265\nwhat I am I'm gonna throw\nthat in the Recycle Bin.\n\n230\n00:10:17.265 --> 00:10:20.337\nNo, I'm just a horrible believer in the\nfact that the Delete key should actually\n\n231\n00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:22.661\nwork the way the Delete key specifies-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:24.078\n&gt;&gt; Which is that it will delete something.\n\n233\n00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:27.156\nThis, I don't know if this is like\na Macintosh keyboard thing, but\n\n234\n00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:30.612\nI'm thinking Delete is pretty much\nuniversal, and I was hitting the Delete\n\n235\n00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:32.601\nkey, and it was not working, so-\n&gt;&gt; Don't\n\n236\n00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:33.532\nbelieve everything you think, Adam.\n\n237\n00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:35.405\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying that, you know what,\n\n238\n00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:38.883\nI'm gonna have to go find Mike and give\nhim a piece of my mind about this whole\n\n239\n00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:41.056\nlet's run Windows on\nthe Apple laptop thing-\n\n240\n00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:41.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:43.414\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that'll work just fine, and\n\n242\n00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:45.094\nyou know, that won't be a problem.\n\n243\n00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:48.404\nAll right, so I've put it in the Recycle\nBin, now let's just see what's in there,\n\n244\n00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:50.170\ngot some stuff in there, right?\n\n245\n00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.150\nSo let's go ahead and let's empty the\nRecycle Bin, cuz obviously deleting and\n\n246\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.600\nputting it in the Recycle Bin\nis not really deleting,\n\n247\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.070\nit's just moving it from\none directory to another.\n\n248\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:04.968\nWe've removed it by putting it in the\nRecycle Bin and then getting rid of it,\n\n249\n00:11:04.968 --> 00:11:10.237\nso let's go back and let's actually go and\nlet's go do this again.\n\n250\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.134\nLet's clear the tool,\nin other words, just start recovery,\n\n251\n00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:20.346\nkinda reset it, Recover Files,\nclick Next, go to the C drive,\n\n252\n00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:24.647\nclick Next, Search for deleted files,\nso let that do its thing.\n\n253\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.810\nJust wait for that to come up.\n\n254\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.262\nOkay, now what do we got?\n\n255\n00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:44.366\nYou'll see right there,\nunder Lost and Found, what do I have?\n\n256\n00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:49.050\nI have, let me just move that over so we\ncan see, I got my new text document .txt,\n\n257\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.750\nand you'll notice I get a little preview.\n\n258\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.320\nCan we go full screen, it's gonna be\nhard to see the preview at the bottom.\n\n259\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.120\nYou'll see that when I highlight it,\nthe tool gives me a little preview area.\n\n260\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.743\nI did show you ahead of time what was\nthere, right, it said Hello World,\n\n261\n00:11:59.743 --> 00:12:01.020\nyou could see it there.\n\n262\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.417\nDo a little new image bitmap,\nthere is my signature bitmap,\n\n263\n00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:06.155\nand you could see it's there.\n\n264\n00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:08.399\nSo you could see that I've\nactually found those files,\n\n265\n00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:11.812\neven though they've been deleted, and it\ngives me a little information down here.\n\n266\n00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:16.570\nFile type, file name, directory, height,\nwidth, bit, file size, whatever,\n\n267\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.050\nall the stuff I would need to know.\n\n268\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.300\nNow in addition, this version of the tool,\nthis is just a sample\n\n269\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.360\nof the tool we installed,\nit's not the fully licensed one,\n\n270\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.840\nyou could see we have the hey,\nbuy online thing here.\n\n271\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.330\nIf we were, again go full-screen for\nme cuz I wanna show this,\n\n272\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.445\nif we were actually using the fully\nlicensed version of the tool,\n\n273\n00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:36.715\nI would be able to go in and\nI would have a restore option here.\n\n274\n00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.695\nI could actually grab the file,\nand I could restore it.\n\n275\n00:12:39.695 --> 00:12:42.566\nYou'll notice I don't have the option\ncuz I'm using the free demo version.\n\n276\n00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:43.865\n&gt;&gt; Demo version.\n&gt;&gt; I can find files,\n\n277\n00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:47.112\nI can't restore them, I can preview them,\nbut I can't restore them.\n\n278\n00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:50.692\nBut in the fully licensed version of the\ntool, I would actually be able to go and\n\n279\n00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:51.902\nrestore the file.\n\n280\n00:12:51.902 --> 00:12:56.112\nNow I can also go here, right, I can go to\nFile Types, so it shows me a breakdown of\n\n281\n00:12:56.112 --> 00:13:01.481\nfile types, so I can now again find it\nby text, find it by link, bitmap, etc.\n\n282\n00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:04.731\nOther extensions shows me all the other\nstuff that I saw before, right?\n\n283\n00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:09.073\nSo I can do that, I could see again\nby data, I can break it down and\n\n284\n00:13:09.073 --> 00:13:13.513\ngo in by date, and I can find it\nbased on when the file was created.\n\n285\n00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:18.452\nAnd so as a result, I can take a look and\nI can see when the file was created,\n\n286\n00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:22.000\nI can see the date timestamp\nhere with the tool.\n\n287\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.610\nI have a little event log that\ntells me everything I did in here.\n\n288\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.570\nAgain, forensically, I may have to\nprovide evidence of what I did,\n\n289\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.860\nthe tool that was used, and\na standard list of information and\n\n290\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.880\nstuff that I'll have to show at trial,\npotentially, to show how I did this.\n\n291\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.970\nAnd so\nall this stuff is in a tool like this,\n\n292\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.300\nallows me to find files\nthat have been deleted.\n\n293\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.433\nAnd as I said, I could recover them as\nwell if necessary, it's just that I would\n\n294\n00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:47.277\nobviously have to have a fully licensed\nfeature-set in the tool to do so.\n\n295\n00:13:47.277 --> 00:13:50.820\nThis is one way we can go in and\nfind files when things don't go our way.\n\n296\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.920\nHey, we looked, and the files aren't\nwhere they're supposed to be.\n\n297\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.002\nWell, they're probably there,\nwe just gotta go dig a little deeper and\n\n298\n00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.930\nfind them, so this is one tool\nthat allows us to do this.\n\n299\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.580\nLet's take a look potentially at something\nelse, so let's go and take a look.\n\n300\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.890\nAnd again, if we could go full-screen,\nyou'll see this here,\n\n301\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.040\nthis is another tool.\n\n302\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.340\nThis is by a company called Paraben,\nthis is called P2 Commander.\n\n303\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.950\nIt's another tool, it's a little more\ninvolved, a lot more extensive, and\n\n304\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.920\nwe'll get into this tool a little\nbit more in another demonstration.\n\n305\n00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.780\nBut I can do the similar thing here,\nI can go through, I can run a search on\n\n306\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.580\nthe machine, and I can look at the tool,\nrather look at the output of the tool.\n\n307\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.116\nI could find the same bitmap image file,\nyou'll see it there, I already did that.\n\n308\n00:14:28.116 --> 00:14:32.818\nYou'll see I can preview it, but if you\nnotice, I can also at the bottom here,\n\n309\n00:14:32.818 --> 00:14:35.812\nI have information,\nI could view the thumbnail,\n\n310\n00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:38.210\nI could view a hex view of the data.\n\n311\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.780\nSo I could view the data in hex, I could\nview a text view, this is a image file,\n\n312\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.460\nso text view's not really gonna matter.\n\n313\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.130\nI can view the File View,\nI can look at the File Slack,\n\n314\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.910\nI can look at the slack space,\nthe white space,\n\n315\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.297\nessentially, looking to see if\nthere's anything hidden there.\n\n316\n00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:54.523\nThis tool's a lot more powerful,\nthis tool allows me to go and\n\n317\n00:14:54.523 --> 00:14:55.885\ndo a really deep analysis.\n\n318\n00:14:55.885 --> 00:15:00.240\n&gt;&gt; So if this was like a stenography type\nof heightened file thing going on here,\n\n319\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.855\nyou'd be able to see that with this tool.\n\n320\n00:15:01.855 --> 00:15:05.285\n&gt;&gt; I would, and if I look at\nthe hex view of the text file,\n\n321\n00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:07.308\nwhich I'm looking at right there,\nASCII text,\n\n322\n00:15:07.308 --> 00:15:10.695\nyou could see I can actually see\nthe text along with the hex.\n\n323\n00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:12.218\n&gt;&gt; That's so cool.\n&gt;&gt; So it lets me go in much deeper and\n\n324\n00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:13.930\ndo a much more thorough analysis.\n\n325\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.334\nThis is where we get out of the hey, let's\njust find it, into the hey, we found it,\n\n326\n00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.780\nnow what does it really look like,\nportion of our program.\n\n327\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.451\nWhen we're doing deeper forensics and\nstarting to examine the file types we see\n\n328\n00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:27.120\nand really drilling down on them, a tool\nlike this is gonna provide the recovery\n\n329\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.333\ncapability but\nalso the analysis capability.\n\n330\n00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:32.680\n&gt;&gt; So evidence gathering versus\nevidence analysis, really.\n\n331\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.231\n&gt;&gt; Correct, or both.\n\n332\n00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:33.955\n&gt;&gt; Or both.\n\n333\n00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:36.570\n&gt;&gt; Depending on what we're doing, right,\nobviously it may be a little bit of both.\n\n334\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.830\nSo it's obviously gonna be helpful for\nus to drill in and to take a look at that.\n\n335\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.950\nSo I just wanted to show\nyou some of this stuff and\n\n336\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.910\nshow you how we actually do some of this.\n\n337\n00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.352\nCuz you know, talking about hey, and\n\n338\n00:15:45.352 --> 00:15:48.180\nwhen we go search and we don't find\nwhat we need, have a backup plan.\n\n339\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.710\nWell, guess what,\nthat's our backup plan right there, right?\n\n340\n00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.066\nBecause a lot of times, people are gonna\ntake that data and try to hide it from us.\n\n341\n00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:57.702\nWell, the reality is we can find it,\nwe just gotta know where to look, right?\n\n342\n00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:00.811\nAnd so remember,\nnext time you're gonna delete something,\n\n343\n00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:02.739\nbuyer beware caveat emptor, right?\n\n344\n00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:04.038\nYou're probably not deleting it,\n\n345\n00:16:04.038 --> 00:16:06.190\nyou're really just making it harder for\nus to find.\n\n346\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.140\nBut somebody with the right tools,\nthe right knowledge,\n\n347\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.308\ncan pull that data right back off\nthat drive and allow us to see it.\n\n348\n00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.210\nSo you wanna keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that next time you're up to no\n\n349\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.200\ngood and hiding things you're\nnot supposed to be doing.\n\n350\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.390\nSo what about privacy protection?\n\n351\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.310\nWe've been talking about\nworkplace searches,\n\n352\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.260\ntalking about the expectation of privacy,\nbeen through that.\n\n353\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.000\nAccording to the privacy protection act\nin the United States, it is unlawful for\n\n354\n00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.520\na government officer to search for or\n\n355\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.420\ncease materials when the materials\nare work product materials.\n\n356\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.410\nOne of the materials include mental\nimpressions, conclusions, or theories.\n\n357\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.805\nWhen the materials are possessed for the\npurpose of communicating the material to\n\n358\n00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:45.190\nthe public, by a person,\nsome form of public communication.\n\n359\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:50.115\nMeaning, in other words; if you\nare working for a government entity, and\n\n360\n00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:55.511\nyou are a government officer asked to do\na search of another government entities,\n\n361\n00:16:55.511 --> 00:17:02.040\nor government employees' information and\ntheir materials, etc., etc., etc., right.\n\n362\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.870\nIt's unlawful for\nyou to do that if the materials are work\n\n363\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.570\nproduct materials without having\na warrant and justifiable cause.\n\n364\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.210\nSo, again, under the Privacy Protection\nAct we are afforded certain protections\n\n365\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.990\nand we are afforded certain rights and\nexpectations but\n\n366\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.840\nwe obviously have to operate accordingly.\n\n367\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.900\nAs an agent we have to know that.\n\n368\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.500\nAnd as an investigator we would\nhave to be aware of that.\n\n369\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.760\nNow remember just cuz we\nknow this is an agent.\n\n370\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.290\nDoesn't mean the bad actors\ndon't know this as well, right.\n\n371\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.540\nSome of the most educated people I've\nmet with regards to what these laws are.\n\n372\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.672\nAre the bad actors that we're finding.\n\n373\n00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:34.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And trying to investigate.\n\n374\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.790\nBecause they know it better than anybody..\n\n375\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.460\nBecause they're operating, right, tying to\nreally be within the boundary of that law,\n\n376\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.510\nso that they know what their rights are,\nso they can do what they wanna do, but\n\n377\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.350\nnot get caught because they could say,\nwell wait a second,\n\n378\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.730\nyou don't have the right to search.\n\n379\n00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.960\nSo, you can't find that information.\n\n380\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.350\nIf you do, you don't have\nthe right to use it against me.\n\n381\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.100\nSo, you gotta be real careful about this\nand obviously understand this, right?\n\n382\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.330\nThere are exceptions to any rule\nas we've often talked about and\n\n383\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.650\nwe wanna keep that in mind.\n\n384\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.810\nWhat about if we have multiple\ngeographic locations?\n\n385\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.640\nWhat if we have multiple\noffices in different areas?\n\n386\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.370\nAnd we have a warrant for one office.\n\n387\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.420\nDoes that warrant cover all\nthe offices that we wanna search?\n\n388\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing not because\nit's boundaries and things.\n\n389\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Warrants are geographically\nspecific and defined.\n\n390\n00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.179\nI'm searching studio 4 at ITProTV.\n\n391\n00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:20.280\nThat's what the warrant says,\nthat's what I search.\n\n392\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.709\nIf ITProTV has another location,\nthis warrant doesn't cover that location,\n\n393\n00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:28.967\nit only covers the location for\nstudio 4 and/or student 4 happened to me.\n\n394\n00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:30.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So multiple locations,\n\n395\n00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.700\nthe rule of thumb is multiple locations,\nmultiple warrants.\n\n396\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.650\nThat's how you deal with that.\n\n397\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.560\nSo you gotta make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n398\n00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.385\nWhat about what we call\na no-knock warrant?\n\n399\n00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:40.660\nA no-knock warrant.\n\n400\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.454\nWhat does a no-knock warrant imply?\n\n401\n00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.005\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've heard of knock warrants\nwhere they come to your door and\n\n402\n00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:47.930\nthe knock on your door, and say we have\na warrant here to search the premises.\n\n403\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.457\nI would think a no-knock warrant would be,\nI'm coming in to search the residence or\n\n404\n00:18:52.457 --> 00:18:56.690\nthe premises and I didn't have to inform\nyou of that, I'm just gonna do that.\n\n405\n00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.404\n&gt;&gt; So essentially a no-knock warrant\nallows us to search a computer or\n\n406\n00:19:00.404 --> 00:19:04.652\nseize it rather without a head of time or\nwithout a preemptive notification.\n\n407\n00:19:04.652 --> 00:19:06.752\nBecause again,\nyou may destroy evidence if we said,\n\n408\n00:19:06.752 --> 00:19:09.980\nby the way we're showing up morning\ntomorrow to come and take the computer.\n\n409\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.590\nMake sure everything's in order and you\nhave all the documents labeled for us, so\n\n410\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.455\nwe know where all the bad stuff is, right.\n\n411\n00:19:14.455 --> 00:19:16.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we call it a no-knock warrant\n\n412\n00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.460\nbecause it allows us to search and\nseize without prior notification, so\n\n413\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.120\nthat way we can theoretically catch you up\nto no good and you can't destroy anything.\n\n414\n00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.980\nWe also have what are called\ndelayed notice warrants.\n\n415\n00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.570\nWe often refer to that as sneaking and\npeeking.\n\n416\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.840\nWe can sneak in and\n\n417\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.240\ntake a look at something when you're\nnot there, under certain conditions.\n\n418\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.040\nAnd as a result of that, we may then be\nable to notify you after the fact that\n\n419\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.690\nwe're serving with a warrant and\nwe already took stuff, because we found\n\n420\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.090\nreasonable and justifiable cause for\nus to be able to do so.\n\n421\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.860\nSo there's a lot of ways for us to turn\nthis information, manipulate it, right?\n\n422\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.880\nWire taps are placed as a result\nof evidence that we may\n\n423\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.510\nthink we're gonna uncover,\nand justifiable cause.\n\n424\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.330\nAnd then after the fact,\nyou're notified maybe days, weeks,\n\n425\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.540\nmonths later,\nthat you've been under surveillance.\n\n426\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.320\nThat's a delayed notice warning,\na delayed notice notification.\n\n427\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.320\nSo you wanna be aware of that.\n\n428\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.130\nKeep in mind, we also have certain\ncategories that are exempted, right?\n\n429\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.600\nSo we talk about privilege\na lot of the times, right?\n\n430\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.370\nSo privilege is inviolable\nwhen we're searching what\n\n431\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.530\nwe call a disinterested party.\n\n432\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.110\nA lawyer, a physician, a clergy person.\n\n433\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:26.780\nThey all have patient client, doctor-\n&gt;&gt; Confidentiality.\n\n434\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.550\n&gt;&gt; Doctor, patient, client,\nlawyer confidentiality.\n\n435\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.675\nYou have the sanctity of the confessional,\nor\n\n436\n00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:38.590\na clergy person, whatever relationship,\n\n437\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.828\nit's the end of the day-\n\n438\n00:20:40.828 --> 00:20:41.378\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:43.060\n&gt;&gt; I have this super moment.\n\n440\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.800\nWhatever religion you may be.\n\n441\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.030\nRight, whether it's a Rabbi,\n\n442\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.890\nwhether it's a Priest.\nWhatever it is,\n\n443\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.460\nwhatever that clergy person is.\nIf you're talking to them and\n\n444\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.750\nthe expectation is what you're telling\nthem is going to be kept confidential.\n\n445\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.630\nThat is something the law recognizes, and\n\n446\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.180\nas a result, we have to have a strategy\nin place to search that does not breach\n\n447\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.390\nthe privilege that is inherently\nallowed for, in these circumstances.\n\n448\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.283\nSo, if I'm talking to my doctor,\nlet's say, right, about an issue, and\n\n449\n00:21:10.283 --> 00:21:13.647\nthen you come in to search\nthe medical computer, and\n\n450\n00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:18.463\nthe records in that office, you're not\nallowed to broadly search all that\n\n451\n00:21:18.463 --> 00:21:22.611\ninformation that may not pertain\nto what the warrant has to say.\n\n452\n00:21:22.611 --> 00:21:25.622\nSo you can't search my records, you can\nalways search narrowly what's being\n\n453\n00:21:25.622 --> 00:21:28.813\ndefined in the warrant even though I maybe\nthere talking about something that maybe\n\n454\n00:21:28.813 --> 00:21:31.228\nof interest to you,\nif you didn't know about it ahead of time,\n\n455\n00:21:31.228 --> 00:21:33.730\nyou have no way of finding out\nabout it through that search.\n\n456\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.721\n&gt;&gt; You were like doctor, I was stubbing\nthis guy to death and I got a little\n\n457\n00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:39.437\nthing on my elbow and, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] tennis elbow,\n\n458\n00:21:39.437 --> 00:21:41.129\ncan you help me out with that?\n\n459\n00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:42.290\nI gotta go back and finish the job.\n\n460\n00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n461\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.490\n&gt;&gt; The guy Is waiting on me.\n\n462\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.680\nIt's inconvenient.\n\n463\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.560\nSo, we wanna make sure we understand\nthat there are certain privilege\n\n464\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.670\ncategories that are exempted\nnormally from searches.\n\n465\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.870\nYou can't show up with a warrant and\n\n466\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.580\nsay to a doctor,\ngive me all the patient records.\n\n467\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.070\nThat's not gonna work, right?\n\n468\n00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.030\nBecause you're essentially what we\ncall a phishing expedition, right?\n\n469\n00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.700\nUnless you know specifically\nwhat you're looking for and\n\n470\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.780\nyou have figured out a way under\nthe law to get clearance to see that,\n\n471\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.130\nchances are good the doctor's gonna say,\nhey, guess what?\n\n472\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.000\nTalk to my lawyer you're not\ngetting anything, right?\n\n473\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.080\nBecause I don't have a reason or\na right to give you that information,\n\n474\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.580\nit's protected, it's privileged.\n\n475\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.620\nSo we call that the concept of\nthe disinterested party, right.\n\n476\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.730\nThey are not gonna be\nable to give that to you.\n\n477\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.830\nDrafting the affidavit and\nthe warrant, as I have talked about,\n\n478\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.420\nis also very important part of this.\n\n479\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.382\nThe warrant and\n\n480\n00:22:25.382 --> 00:22:29.822\nthe attachments are what you actually\nare going to seek from the court.\n\n481\n00:22:29.822 --> 00:22:33.128\nIt has to accurately and particularly\ndescribe the property to be seized,\n\n482\n00:22:33.128 --> 00:22:35.350\nhardware, software,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n483\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.710\nThe affidavit is the paperwork you\nfile with the court to explain why\n\n484\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.920\nyou are seeking the warrant.\n\n485\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.580\nIt's the justification or\nthe probable cause that you are showing\n\n486\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.140\nthat you feel will then give you\nthe right to go out and do the search.\n\n487\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.720\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n488\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.520\nKeep in mind the most\nchallenges that occur\n\n489\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.140\nwith this process occur against\nthe affidavits that are filed.\n\n490\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.830\nMeaning, hey you know what, you didn't\nhave justifiable or probable cause.\n\n491\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.250\nChallenges arise if we\nplace too much reliance\n\n492\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.590\non certain things when\nwe provide an affidavit.\n\n493\n00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.900\nHere's one example.\n\n494\n00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.200\nWhen you're searching or\n\n495\n00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.740\ntrying to search for information\nabout usage of the Internet, right?\n\n496\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.540\nIf we put too much reliance\non ISP records and\n\n497\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.860\ndata that's gathered through the\nmonitoring, whether it's a radius server\n\n498\n00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.650\nor auditing capabilities that ISPs have\nwith regards to how you use their systems.\n\n499\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.670\nIf we put too much reliance on that for\ntargeting a specific IP address or\n\n500\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.250\nan account, in the affidavit to search.\n\n501\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.130\nAnd therefore get a warrant based on that,\nwe may challenge that warrant's issuance.\n\n502\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.720\nAnd may actually have that warrant\nthrown out, and the search, and\n\n503\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.620\nthe evidence from that search destroyed.\n\n504\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.230\nOr essentially just gotten rid of,\nnot in the eyes of the court being viable.\n\n505\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.739\nBecause we said essentially,\nhey you're targeting an individual without\n\n506\n00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:50.381\njustifiable probable cause,\nand that can be a problem.\n\n507\n00:23:50.381 --> 00:23:53.835\nSo we have to be very careful here\nas we file our affidavits and\n\n508\n00:23:53.835 --> 00:23:58.310\nwe potentially seek to claim justifiable,\nor whatever the circumstances and\n\n509\n00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.199\ncause may be, but justifiable\nactivities to get a warrant issued.\n\n510\n00:24:02.199 --> 00:24:05.879\nAgain, it's up to the judge and the judge\nmay or may not interpret this this way.\n\n511\n00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:08.211\nBut we have to think about this and\nbe aware of this and\n\n512\n00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:10.340\nunderstand that there could be an issue.\n\n513\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.595\nThe affidavit has to include\nan explanation of the search strategy.\n\n514\n00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:16.611\nIt's very important criteria, something\nyou do wanna know about and be aware of.\n\n515\n00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:21.390\nIt's essentially what I'm suggesting is,\nit's probably something good to know.\n\n516\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.200\nIf you're ever asked about what would\nbe scoped, or what would part of\n\n517\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.270\nthe affidavit, and what is important for\nyou to specify, knowing that the search\n\n518\n00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.470\nstrategy is something you wanna list\nthere would probably be helpful.\n\n519\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:36.967\nThe electronic communications privacy act,\nwhat's called ecpa,\n\n520\n00:24:36.967 --> 00:24:39.613\nECPA in the United States is important.\n\n521\n00:24:39.613 --> 00:24:43.138\nThis is the part of the law,\nor the broad category of law,\n\n522\n00:24:43.138 --> 00:24:45.710\nthat deals with stored communications,\n\n523\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.500\nwhich deals with electronic communications\nand data that's then store it.\n\n524\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.910\nSo we have to think about this and no,\nthe privacy rights for customers and\n\n525\n00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.390\nsubscribers of computer network on\nthe internet sites for instance or\n\n526\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.790\nguaranteed through the electronic\ncommunication privacy act in the US.\n\n527\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.330\nWhich is actually interesting, there are\nproviders of two types that have named or\n\n528\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.690\ndefined in the act.\n\n529\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.780\nElectronic communications\nservice providers and\n\n530\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.060\nremote computing service\nproviders were to called ECSs and\n\n531\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.470\nRCSs and kind of guess based on\nthe classifications what falls into what.\n\n532\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.200\nThe electronic communication\nservice is defined as any service\n\n533\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.940\nwhich provides to users thereof\nthe ability to send and receive wire or\n\n534\n00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.948\nelectronic communications quote\ndirectly from the statute.\n\n535\n00:25:28.948 --> 00:25:33.450\nWhat that essencially means is anything\nthat has to do with things like\n\n536\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.050\nthe internet, email, anything that\ngoes over the wire or electronically\n\n537\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.170\nis governed under electronic\ncommunication service definitions.\n\n538\n00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.160\nOur remote computing services is defined\nagain quoting directly from the act\n\n539\n00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.740\nas a provision to the public\nof computer storage or\n\n540\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.030\nprocessing service by means of\nan electronic communication system.\n\n541\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.610\nSo, cloud computing would be covered\nunder this particular category as with\n\n542\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:01.420\nthings like VPN access,\nremote access to a system from outside,\n\n543\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.950\nthings like that, would be classified\nunder remote computing services.\n\n544\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.360\nSo, information is classified as\nthree different types within the act.\n\n545\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.550\nBasic subscriber information, records or\nother information pertaining to a customer\n\n546\n00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:20.950\nor subscriber and content within,\nor content on the network itself.\n\n547\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.360\nSo, we have information about the user,\nbasic subscriber information,\n\n548\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.915\nrecords pertaining to the customer or\nthe subscriber.\n\n549\n00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:32.250\nMore detailed information, place of\nresidence, billing information, etc.\n\n550\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.120\nAnd then any data or content that\nmay be on the network as a result.\n\n551\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.880\nThree distinct categories of\ndata that we look at as well.\n\n552\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.850\nAgain, this is all laid out\nin the Communication Act,\n\n553\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:46.130\nand we'll have a reference for you with\nregards to the specific name of the act\n\n554\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:51.060\nbut also the standard, 18 USC 2701\nto 2712 is the actual reference\n\n555\n00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:55.840\nin the actual code, but you,\nwe'll see that in the show, next.\n\n556\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.970\nDaniel will provide all that to you.\n\n557\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.950\nWe also talk about what\nis known as compelled\n\n558\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.830\ndisclosure under the communication act.\n\n559\n00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.540\nCompelled disclosure are the mechanisms\nthat can be brought to bear and\n\n560\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.360\nused by an agent to\ncentrally compel a provider\n\n561\n00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.010\nto provide details of a customer's\nrecords and a customer's activities.\n\n562\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.290\nThis is what the government often\nuses when they go to an ISP and\n\n563\n00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.350\nserve a subpoena and say essentially hey,\nguess what, we're here,\n\n564\n00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.440\nwe want the records of this or that party.\n\n565\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.260\nWe're talking about compelled\ndisclosure under the ECPA.\n\n566\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.160\nAnd these are the five\nmechanisms that could be used.\n\n567\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.014\nIt could be important for\nyou to be aware of these.\n\n568\n00:27:33.014 --> 00:27:37.320\nA subpoena with prior notice\nto the subscriber or customer.\n\n569\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.650\nA court order with prior notice to\nthe subscriber or customer and or\n\n570\n00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.680\na search warrant.\n\n571\n00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.970\nThese are the five mechanisms that\ncan be use to compel disclosure.\n\n572\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.640\nSome notify you ahead of time others\ndo not as we were talking about.\n\n573\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.370\nWe also have a category notice\nvoluntary disclosure under ECPA.\n\n574\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:58.470\nVoluntary disclosure provides for\nthe ability to freely disclose\n\n575\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.250\ncontent and/or other records relating\nto stored communication, and\n\n576\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.510\nwe may allow the provider to do so\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n577\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.860\nProviders of services not available to\nthe public can freely disclose that\n\n578\n00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.830\ninformation under the voluntary visclosure\nact without requiring a subpoena or\n\n579\n00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.330\na court order to do so.\n\n580\n00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.440\nSo if it's not publicly available,\nMeaning, let's say that the provider\n\n581\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.930\nprovides a unique service but\nit's not available to the general public.\n\n582\n00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.720\nThe government can go to them and\nsay essentially, hey,\n\n583\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.160\nunder the voluntary clause we need\nyou to voluntarily disclose that.\n\n584\n00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.120\nWe're not gonna get a court order,\n\n585\n00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.800\nwe're just telling you that you have to,\nbecause it's not publicly available.\n\n586\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.870\nAnd as a result we don't need to go and\nget a subpoena or\n\n587\n00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.320\na court order,\nwe just ask you to essentially.\n\n588\n00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.190\nDisclose that information to us directly.\n\n589\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Are they then mandatorily,\nnecessarily need to comply with that?\n\n590\n00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.670\nOr can they say, well, just cuz we-\n&gt;&gt; They may go to court.\n\n591\n00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.530\nThey don't have to, but\n\n592\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.500\nultimately the court is probably\ngonna find that they have to comply.\n\n593\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.040\nBecause under the act, there is\na specific category carved out for\n\n594\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.180\nvoluntary disclosure that specifies that\nsomething that is not a publicly available\n\n595\n00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.930\nservice should be subject\nto voluntary disclosure.\n\n596\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.378\nUnless they can show a compelling\nargument to the contrary,\n\n597\n00:29:04.378 --> 00:29:06.400\nthen chance would be they\ngoing to have to comply.\n\n598\n00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.965\nSo that can go to court and say,\nhey, we do not agree with that, but\n\n599\n00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:14.015\nit is very unlikely that they are gonna\nbe told that they are gonna win.\n\n600\n00:29:14.015 --> 00:29:16.908\n&gt;&gt; Typically, this is they're just gonna\nbe like okay yeah we see what you're\n\n601\n00:29:16.908 --> 00:29:17.641\ntrying to do here.\n\n602\n00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:19.115\nLet me go ahead and help you out there.\n\n603\n00:29:19.115 --> 00:29:20.135\n&gt;&gt; Essentially,\n\n604\n00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:23.620\nunless there's again a compelling\nargument that may involve life safety.\n\n605\n00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.932\nYeah, they may argue certain things and\nsay, look if we disclose this\n\n606\n00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:32.402\nthe zombie apocalypse is gonna happen,\nand we may not wanna do that.\n\n607\n00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:35.662\nBut it's very unlikely that that\nargument's gonna hold sway in the court.\n\n608\n00:29:35.662 --> 00:29:37.229\n&gt;&gt; Will expose agents in the field, right?\n\n609\n00:29:37.229 --> 00:29:38.392\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n610\n00:29:38.392 --> 00:29:39.652\n&gt;&gt; Which is funny, but yeah.\n\n611\n00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:40.802\nIt could possibly.\n\n612\n00:29:40.802 --> 00:29:44.420\n&gt;&gt; There could be compelling reasons that\nthe government may not be aware of that\n\n613\n00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.205\nmay bar the disclosure, and the court may\nfind those reasons to be legitimate and\n\n614\n00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:49.190\ncompelling.\n\n615\n00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:53.310\nBut chances are good that you show up\nin court and the government's saying,\n\n616\n00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.000\nhey, the law says we need this and you're\nsaying you're not gonna give it to us.\n\n617\n00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.070\nAnd you're gonna be hard pressed to find a\njudge that's gonna agree with you, right?\n\n618\n00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.930\nI'm not saying that\nthe judge's not gonna uphold\n\n619\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.200\nlegitimate rights like fourth\nAmendment rights and things like that.\n\n620\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.030\nBut in this case, clearly defined\nunder a voluntary disclosure cause,\n\n621\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.860\nIt's very tough to make that argument and\nmake it stick.\n\n622\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.650\nBut again, not publicly available.\n\n623\n00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.020\nRight, so very big distinction,\nyou gotta be aware of that and\n\n624\n00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.110\nmake sure you're kind\nof in line with that.\n\n625\n00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.100\nWhen we think about these\nkind of exceptions and\n\n626\n00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.630\nwe made this case before and\ntalked about this before,\n\n627\n00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.940\nwe do wanna understand that it\nis contingent on circumstance.\n\n628\n00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.790\nSo, I keep coming back to this idea and\nkind of thinking through, or\n\n629\n00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.100\nhaving us think through\nthe logic of the fact that\n\n630\n00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.990\nthere may be an interpretive clause here\nwhere a judge may say, you know what.\n\n631\n00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:43.470\nUnder the arguments presented, I may find\nthis to be compelling as a result and\n\n632\n00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.830\nmay or may not agree with the person\nwho's pushing to have the disclosure.\n\n633\n00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.750\nOr the person who's saying I\ndon't want the disclosure,\n\n634\n00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.390\nthere's two sides to every story.\n\n635\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.710\nSo the judge is gonna have to rule\nin favor of one and against another.\n\n636\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.500\nThe questions is, of course, do you have\nthe ability to go to the court and seek\n\n637\n00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.620\nan injunction to be able to essentially\nmake them wait until you figure this out.\n\n638\n00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.750\nOr is the government gonna compel you and\nsay, after the fact, hey, guess what,\n\n639\n00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.687\nyou sued us and we lost but\nwe already got the information.\n\n640\n00:31:07.687 --> 00:31:09.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's like, too bad either way, so\n\n641\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.817\nsometimes it depends.\n\n642\n00:31:10.817 --> 00:31:11.978\n&gt;&gt; They are sneaky characters.\n\n643\n00:31:11.978 --> 00:31:13.580\n&gt;&gt; They are, they are.\n&gt;&gt; The government.\n\n644\n00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.550\nAnyway, well, it definitely lets us\nknow that there's a lot involved when it\n\n645\n00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.970\ncomes to wielding the power of\nthe sword as it were to get evidence.\n\n646\n00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.180\nAnd if you need a warrant, there's a\nspecific way that you have to go about it.\n\n647\n00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.572\nAnd there are specific laws and rights and\n\n648\n00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:31.941\nprivileges that are tied up around it as\nwell to make sure that that's done in\n\n649\n00:31:31.941 --> 00:31:36.815\na way that's not damaging to somebody that\nmaybe Is innocent of something, right?\n\n650\n00:31:36.815 --> 00:31:38.691\nWe wanna protect our rights\nof our citizens, but\n\n651\n00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:40.700\nwe also need to be able\nto investigate crime.\n\n652\n00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.437\nHence, the whole purpose\nof using warrants.\n\n653\n00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:46.555\nA police officer just can't go and\nsay, I'm searching your stuff,\n\n654\n00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:49.980\nhe has to have a good reason and\nhe shows that reason.\n\n655\n00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.986\nAnd somebody with authority realizes,\nyes, that you do have a good reason,\n\n656\n00:31:52.986 --> 00:31:53.827\ngo ahead and do that.\n\n657\n00:31:53.827 --> 00:31:55.640\nAnd there's many different ways\nin which that can show itself.\n\n658\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Only if he's not on the border.\n\n659\n00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nOnly if he is not on the border.\n\n660\n00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:00.169\n&gt;&gt; If he is on the border\nthen your screwed.\n\n661\n00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:01.080\n&gt;&gt; You can just forget it.\n\n662\n00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.650\nYour done, it's search time.\n\n663\n00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.080\n&gt;&gt; That being said, Adam thanks so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n664\n00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.540\nWe thank you for watching, but guess what?\n\n665\n00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.216\nWe will have a part four coming.\n\n666\n00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:10.890\n&gt;&gt; Cuatro.\n\n667\n00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.040\n&gt;&gt; Cuatro.\n\n668\n00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.380\nI guess it's not divine but\nat least it's a quadrinity.\n\n669\n00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.290\nIs that what it'd be?\n\n670\n00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.425\nThe quadrinity of shows on search and\nseizure so hopefully-\n\n671\n00:32:19.425 --> 00:32:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Quadrophenia?\n\n672\n00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go,\nQuadrophenia, I like that.\n\n673\n00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.629\nAnd we'll be back with that one,\nhopefully we'll see you there.\n\n674\n00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:26.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one though.\n\n675\n00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.780\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n676\n00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.760\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're gonna do Part four in Studio four.\n\n677\n00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n&gt;&gt; In four minutes.\n\n678\n00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Four by four.\n\n679\n00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Four by four, awesome!\n\n680\n00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.066\n&gt;&gt; See you.\n\n681\n00:32:36.066 --> 00:32:37.142\n&gt;&gt; Come on back.\n\n682\n00:32:37.142 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:13.968\n&gt;&gt; All right, Greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:16.200\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.160\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.560\nit's more on our CHFI Series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.850\nJoining us back yet again, is the man,\nthe myth, the legend that is Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.640\nAdam welcome back and\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.715\n&gt;&gt; Man, myth, and legend, that's MM &amp; L.\n\n10\n00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.920\nI'm going to go by that from now on.\n\n11\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.680\nI like that better than Skippy which\nis my other alias that I don't normally\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.370\nuse very often.\n\n13\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.590\n&gt;&gt; Tres Leche\n&gt;&gt; Tres Leche right that's\n\n14\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.170\nmy\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.730\n&gt;&gt; It's my Mexican wrestler alias.\n\n16\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.880\n&gt;&gt; That's right, luchador.\n\n17\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.890\n&gt;&gt; Be known as Tres Leche.\n\n18\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.600\nAll right, so all is good, all is\nwell here in ITProTV in Studio Four.\n\n19\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.615\nWe are gonna continue with part four\nat 4:00, It's just after 4:00, but\n\n20\n00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:53.470\nclose enough.\n\n21\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.322\n&gt;&gt; It's 4:04.\n\n22\n00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:55.310\n&gt;&gt; It is 4:04.\n\n23\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The forces keep piling up.\n\n24\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.440\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue with our\nconversation, wrap this whole section up,\n\n25\n00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.780\nput a bow on it so\nto speak here in a few minutes.\n\n26\n00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.350\nAnd then get ready for some additional and\nexciting conversations.\n\n27\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.750\nI'm gonna deal with digital\nevidence gathering,\n\n28\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.060\nhaving to do with first responders, and\nhow they're supposed to view the world.\n\n29\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.740\nDeal with how to setup a forensic's lab,\na lot of other interesting stuff we'll\n\n30\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.980\ncontinue to talk about in\nthe episodes to come so\n\n31\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.060\nstay tuned today as they say,\nbecause we have a lot more to talk about.\n\n32\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.800\nBut before we get to any of that, wanna\ncontinue our conversation with regards to\n\n33\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.920\nsearching and ceasing of computers.\n\n34\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.580\nWe've been extensively\ntaking about warrant,\n\n35\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.350\nwarrantless phase searches, examples\nI haven't dealt with these things,\n\n36\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.940\nexemptions and statutes so\nwe wanna be aware of.\n\n37\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240\nWant to continue that conversation\naround electronic surveillance in\n\n38\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.730\ncommunications networks.\n\n39\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.920\nDaniel and\nI were chatting before we got online for\n\n40\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.650\nthis particular episode with regards to\n\n41\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.220\nthe activities of certain unnamed agencies\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.070\n&gt;&gt; that may have engaged\n\n43\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.630\nin this kind of behavior.\n\n44\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.640\nAt certain points, and as I pointed out,\nprobably still continued to\n\n45\n00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.090\non a regular basis both here in the US and\nof course abroad, because\n\n46\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.720\nwe don't want to leave out our neighbors\nto the north, south, east, and west.\n\n47\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.140\n&gt;&gt; Never say anything, just remember that.\n\n48\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.630\n&gt;&gt; Well just tapping your,\nquote unquote, partner's cell phones\n\n49\n00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890\nis acceptable behavior in certain\nparts of the world apparently.\n\n50\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.900\nSo it is important for us to recognize and\n\n51\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.840\nunderstand that Daniel was not kidding\naround, right now when he just said,\n\n52\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.570\nanything you say, essentially, if it\ngoes out on the wire, if it is digital,\n\n53\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.540\nas I often tell people,\nyou could assume somebody is listening.\n\n54\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.770\nYou may not know who, when,\nwhy, may never find out, but\n\n55\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.740\nI can promise you that somebody\nsomewhere has made a record of that.\n\n56\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.290\nAnd if you don't want people to know it,\nyou shouldn't put it out on the wire and\n\n57\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.620\nthat's the standing rule\nthat we often operate on.\n\n58\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.270\nBut having said that, as an investigator,\nwe use that to our advantage,\n\n59\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.310\nwe know that there are ways for\nus to gain access to that information.\n\n60\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.010\nBut we do have to think about the ways\nto do it and, most importantly,\n\n61\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.110\nto do it legally and to do it correctly.\n\n62\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610\nAnd we often come back to this idea,\nagain before we start this conversation,\n\n63\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.160\nreminding you our conversation is\ntaking place from the perspective of\n\n64\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.430\nthe US Federal rules,\nFederal regulations and laws of evidence.\n\n65\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.673\nAnd the interpretation of those based\non the Supreme Court cases rather,\n\n66\n00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:13.420\nprecedence and/or anything\nhaving to do with US law.\n\n67\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.350\nYou may have to translate and or interpret\nthese into the various statutes and\n\n68\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.160\nlaws that may occur, and take precedence\nin your little corner of the world.\n\n69\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.260\nBut understand that from the perspective\nof our conversations, and\n\n70\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.790\nfrom the perspective of\npreparing to take the CHFI exam.\n\n71\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.170\nIt is primarily the focus that we use and\n\n72\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.620\nthe focus that you should be aware of\njust want to make sure we have those.\n\n73\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.404\nWe should get that printed\nout on like index cards.\n\n74\n00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:34.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:36.695\n&gt;&gt; Just have that on like the bottom\nof the screen on like a runner.\n\n76\n00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:37.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly just put that on.\n\n77\n00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.654\n&gt;&gt; So I don't have to keep saying the same\nthing over and over and over again, right,\n\n78\n00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.889\nor just going to be like a little\nhovering cartoon like dialog balloon\n\n79\n00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.120\nbubble that just comes up right\nnext to me while I'm talking.\n\n80\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.890\nThat would be cool.\n\n81\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.990\n&gt;&gt; Remember pop up videos?\n\n82\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.600\nThat would be just like.\n\n83\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.933\n&gt;&gt; Bubble videos or whatever,\nbecause we don't have the wing dings for\n\n84\n00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:57.296\nthe lower third,\nwe couldn't do the add thing.\n\n85\n00:03:57.296 --> 00:04:01.399\nIf you could figure out how to animate\nthat little cartoon dialog balloon and\n\n86\n00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.940\nput that up, boy, extra points for\nyou, that would be awesome.\n\n87\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.290\nAll right, so two federal\nstatutes to govern the real-time,\n\n88\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.840\nelectronic surveillance in criminal\ninvestigations we have to be aware of.\n\n89\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.410\nOne called the Wiretap Statute.\n\n90\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.490\nMost of us are aware of this, although we\nmay not think about it on a regular basis.\n\n91\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.790\nBut the Wiretap Statute,\nthis is commonly called Title III, and\n\n92\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.240\nit's just normally\nreferred to as Title III,\n\n93\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.760\nregulates the collection of\nreal-time content off of the wire.\n\n94\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.760\nTitle III of the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act,\n\n95\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.050\nspecifically, is where it comes from,\njust generally referred to as Title III,\n\n96\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.270\npassed in 1968, believe it or not, it's\nroughly almost 50 years old at this point.\n\n97\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.370\nAnd still relevant and\nimpacting us every day.\n\n98\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.280\nThis creates protected\ncommunication classes,\n\n99\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.740\nthat may not, may not be intercepted,\nunless an exception is applied for and\n\n100\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.640\ngranted under the court finding.\n\n101\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.868\nExceptions to Title III,\n\n102\n00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:58.040\nthere's seven activities that\nare seen as exceptions to this rule.\n\n103\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.620\nInterception pursuant to a court order,\nthe consent exception,\n\n104\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.670\nthe provider exception,\nthe computer trespasser exception,\n\n105\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.620\nwe have to do air quotes for\nthese, by the way.\n\n106\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.390\nThe extension telephone exception,\nthe inadvertently obtained criminal\n\n107\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.750\nevidence exception, and\nthe accessible to the public exception.\n\n108\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.181\nAll of these are exceptions\nto Title III activities,\n\n109\n00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.350\nmeaning that if you engage in activities\nor fall into one of these classes,\n\n110\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.990\nwe could go around the protections\nafforded by title III and we can see and\n\n111\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.890\nor gain access to the information.\n\n112\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.710\nSo if we have a court order,\nwe can essentially wiretap and\n\n113\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.000\ngain access to that information.\n\n114\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.820\nIf you, surprisingly, although this\nreally is not an issue today as much, but\n\n115\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.010\nyears ago, if you remember analog\nphones and you remember the fact\n\n116\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.565\nthat in a facility, you may have multiple\nphones that are tied to the same line.\n\n117\n00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:48.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n118\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.020\n&gt;&gt; If you are on a phone having\na phone call communicating and\n\n119\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.420\nsomebody picked up one of the extensions\nand heard something, and as a result was\n\n120\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.060\nable to use that information There would\nbe an exception to the clause, and\n\n121\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.480\nnormally that conversation\ncommunication would be private.\n\n122\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.740\nUnder certain circumstances somebody\ninadvertently obtaining that criminal\n\n123\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.410\nevidence and/or picking up an extension\nand hearing something, may actually be\n\n124\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.240\nable to claim an exception under Title III\nand be able to sneak that evidence in.\n\n125\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; So you know there's a lot of ways we\n\n126\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.290\ninterpret this,\nit's not as big of a deal today.\n\n127\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.130\nThe extension telephone exception is not\noften used, but inadvertently obtaining\n\n128\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.570\ncriminal evidence is often used as\nis accessibility to the public.\n\n129\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.010\nMeaning, if you do something illegal in\npublic and people see you, guess what?\n\n130\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.010\nWe may actually be able\nto hold it against you.\n\n131\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.140\nSo you want to be aware of that.\n\n132\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.070\n&gt;&gt; When I was a kid, I actually had one\nof the old knob style televisions and\n\n133\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.690\nit had the fine tuning adjustments.\n\n134\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.140\nAnd I could use that to\nlisten in on wireless\n\n135\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.310\ntelephone communications around my area.\n\n136\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.510\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's essentially like this baby monitor-\n\n137\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n138\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Thing today, where a lot of times\nyou have these wireless baby cams or\n\n139\n00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.550\nbaby mo-nitors.\n\n140\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.540\nAnd because they operate on the same\nfrequency, a lot of times if you're\n\n141\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.540\nclose enough to your neighbor, you'll\npick theirs up or they'll pick up yours.\n\n142\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.770\nI got this crazy thing going\non with my neighbor at home.\n\n143\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.620\nThis lovely, absolutely just,\nthey're like little porcelain dolls.\n\n144\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.600\nMy next door neighbors,\nolder couple, really really sweet.\n\n145\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.500\nWe recently installed\na ceiling fan with a light.\n\n146\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.400\nAnd they must have,\neither bought the same one or\n\n147\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.310\nhave one that's on the same\nfrequency as ours.\n\n148\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.350\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n&gt;&gt; So randomly, it freaks my wife out,\n\n149\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.590\nthe middle of the night the light,\ncuz its out in the living room,\n\n150\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.380\nthe light will just randomly turn on and\nor the fan will turn on.\n\n151\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.050\nAnd the first few times this happened you\nknow she went like absolutely nuts she\n\n152\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.740\nwoke me up, she's like there's a ghost.\n\n153\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.680\nI'm like what are you kidding me or\nsomething?\n\n154\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.330\nThere's a ghost, the light just turned on,\nshe was out like on the couch right.\n\n155\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.000\nShe was watching TV or something studying,\nshe fell asleep, the light turned on,\n\n156\n00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.040\nwoke her up, freaked her out\nshe's like there's a ghost.\n\n157\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.060\nThere's no such thing as ghosts,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n158\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.780\nThe light keeps turning on and\noff because we'll go turn it off.\n\n159\n00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.550\nThey'll turn it on.\n\n160\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.550\nWe'll turn it on, they'll turn it off.\n\n161\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.000\nIt's just one of those crazy things.\n\n162\n00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.719\n&gt;&gt; That is hysterical.\n\n163\n00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:55.374\n&gt;&gt; So I keep meaning,\nI have to get around to just changing\n\n164\n00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.498\nthe frequency-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n165\n00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:58.951\n&gt;&gt; -on the other remote control,\nand I keep forgetting to do it.\n\n166\n00:07:58.951 --> 00:07:59.569\nI'm so busy.\n\n167\n00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:01.936\nI have Chance, so it keeps happening.\n\n168\n00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:04.289\nAnd you know we haven't said anything,\nwe feel horrible about it,\n\n169\n00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:06.330\nbut I'm assuming it's probably\nthe same thing for them.\n\n170\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.792\nThey come out,\nthey're like why the hell is the fan off?\n\n171\n00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:08.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We just turned it on.\n\n172\n00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.110\nAnd they keep turning it on and\nwe keep turning it off.\n\n173\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.360\nSo this kind of thing happens,\nhappens all the time.\n\n174\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.470\nYou gotta be aware of that and understand\nthat this kinda stuff does happen.\n\n175\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.130\nAnd like you said, we had not a nanny cam,\nbut a wireless baby monitor.\n\n176\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; When my, both my girls were little.\n\n177\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.620\nAnd we would actually, at certain\npoint when my oldest was first born,\n\n178\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.470\nwe lived in an apartment before\nwe actually bought our house.\n\n179\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.050\nAnd we were picking up\nthe neighbors from downstairs.\n\n180\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.185\nSo, we would hear the baby\ncry thinking it was ours.\n\n181\n00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.760\nWe'd get up and she was like passed out,\ndead to the world.\n\n182\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.790\nWe could never figure it out for\nlike months and\n\n183\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.380\nthen I finally realized it's\ngotta be the kid downstairs.\n\n184\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.550\nAnd we would hear their baby crying\nall the time on the monitor.\n\n185\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.140\n&gt;&gt; So you're getting up twice as\noften as you actually needed to,\n\n186\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.170\nand sleep deprived.\n\n187\n00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.792\nThat's always fun.\n\n188\n00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:50.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:08:50.305 --> 00:08:52.740\n&gt;&gt; That kinda sucked, is what it did.\n\n190\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.790\n&gt;&gt; That's a nightmare scenario.\n\n191\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.100\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it was not good.\n\n192\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.270\nBut yeah, this kind of stuff does happen.\n\n193\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.380\nSo you wanna be aware of that.\n\n194\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.070\nIt can lead to issues and concerns\nbecause you may pick up information and\n\n195\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.240\nobviously, find out about things\nyou're not supposed to hear.\n\n196\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.630\nSo you gotta be aware of that.\n\n197\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.609\nWe also have the second one called the and\ntrap and\n\n198\n00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:09.608\ntrace devices chapter of title 18.\n\n199\n00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:10.680\nThat's a mouthful.\n\n200\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.470\nIt's commonly called the Pen Trap Statute.\n\n201\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.660\nThis governs Pen registers and\ntrap and trace devices.\n\n202\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.520\nWhat you and I were talking about with\nthose lovely government agencies with\n\n203\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.290\nthe three letter acronyms for\nnames get up to.\n\n204\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.370\nThis regulates a collection of\nsupporting metadata for the content.\n\n205\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.760\nThis is actually the statute they\noperated under to grab the metadata for\n\n206\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.220\nall the phone conversations,\ncell phone grabs that they were doing,\n\n207\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.380\nbecause it was all the metadata\nthat they were grabbing and\n\n208\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.130\ndoing bulk searches on the metadata to\ndrill down, to actually find the records.\n\n209\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.640\nIt was done under the trap and\ntrace statute.\n\n210\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.730\nWhich is what they were using, or\n\n211\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.771\nat least in theory,\nwhat they claimed was supposedly legal.\n\n212\n00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; When they were doing it.\n\n213\n00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:49.934\nSo to obtain a pen trap or\ntrace order you must do the following.\n\n214\n00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:52.700\nThe applicant must identify themselves.\n\n215\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.400\nThey must identify the law enforcement\nagency conducting the investigation, and\n\n216\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.290\nthen certify their belief that information\nlikely to be obtained is relevant to\n\n217\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.640\nan ongoing criminal investigation\nbeing conducted by that agency.\n\n218\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.310\nSo in other words they have to\ngo on record as stipulating\n\n219\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.090\nthat they want this information,\nthey have compelling evidence and\n\n220\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.720\nreason to believe they need it, and that\nthey're willing to state so for a court.\n\n221\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.180\nNow the way they do this, and\nthe way they're getting around it now,\n\n222\n00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.840\ncuz we're talking about the fact\nthat this still goes on but\n\n223\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.520\nthey're not really doing it this way.\n\n224\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.540\nIs they're still taking advantage of\nthe FISA court and just going to FISA and\n\n225\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.390\nessentially in the U.S.,\n\n226\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.630\nsaying hey by the way, we have a\ncompelling national security interest, and\n\n227\n00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.610\nunder FISA, we don't have to\ndisclose any of this information.\n\n228\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.750\nWe do it in a closed court,\nin front of a judge that hears this, and\n\n229\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.330\nwe claim national security.\n\n230\n00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.260\nJudge signs the sealed order that gives us\nessentially blanket coverage to do this\n\n231\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.650\nstuff and nobody ever finds out about it.\n\n232\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.560\nNow again, to be clear,\nthis is in the U.S., this is through\n\n233\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.240\nthe FISA court system, and the FISA\nstatutes as part of the Patriot Act and\n\n234\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.620\nall the stuff that had gone\non as a result of that.\n\n235\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.480\nThis is limited to the U.S.,\nalthough other governments have\n\n236\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.850\nstandards that essentially allow\nthem to operate the same way,\n\n237\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.580\nbut it may not be referenced\nunder the same way.\n\n238\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.710\nBut this is something that could be done\nas an extra judicial process outside\n\n239\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.720\nthe normal courts.\n\n240\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.520\nBut done under a special court, under\na special law, in this case in the US.\n\n241\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.360\nSo there are reasons to understand and\nbelieve that this still goes on\n\n242\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.100\neven though it may not be\ngoing on with our knowledge.\n\n243\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIt's just cuz it\n\n244\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.450\npertains to national security.\n\n245\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.870\nThey can use that as a,\nif we give away our national secrets,\n\n246\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.130\nthen they're not secrets anymore.\n\n247\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.010\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n248\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.920\n&gt;&gt; They can go around the Pen Trap and\nTrace Statute and go directly\n\n249\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.770\nto a FISA court if they can claim and\nprove national security interest.\n\n250\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:38.800\nIt's a much broader and\nmuch more unrestricted grant of access.\n\n251\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.843\nUnder the Pen Trap and Trace Statute there\nare very specific guidelines as to what\n\n252\n00:11:42.843 --> 00:11:44.044\nthey can and cannot do.\n\n253\n00:11:44.044 --> 00:11:49.560\nUnder a FISA order, nobody really\nknows for sure what you're able to do.\n\n254\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.230\nBecause only the people that have the FISA\norder actually know what you're granting\n\n255\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.430\npermission to do.\n\n256\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.640\nAnd there's a gag order\nassociated with this.\n\n257\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.280\nSo typically if you get served with a FISA\norder to disclose as the provider or\n\n258\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.410\nas the ISP you can never tell the customer\nwho's targeted anything about this for\n\n259\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.860\nfear that if you do, you will likely\ngo to jail on espionage charges.\n\n260\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.140\nAnd you may literally never\nsee the light of day again\n\n261\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.990\nbecause you're violating a grab\nunder national security.\n\n262\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.290\nIn theory, during a time of war,\n\n263\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.030\nif you were to violate that you could\nactually be executed for espionage.\n\n264\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou're an enemy combatant at that point.\n\n265\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.700\nAnd say goodbye.\n\n266\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.050\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's kind of crazy stuff.\n\n267\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.090\nAnd I'm not suggesting that this\ntakes place all the time, but\n\n268\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.300\nI'm simply pointing out that one of\nthe ways that a lot of these evidences is\n\n269\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.710\ngathered today in certain areas is\nunder these statutes, and it's not\n\n270\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.040\nnecessarily under the common statutes\nthat most of us would operate under.\n\n271\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.570\nAnd we just have to be aware of\nthe fact that this stuff does exist and\n\n272\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.030\ndoes still take place so.\n\n273\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.460\nIt's one of those things.\n\n274\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.590\nSo evidence, obviously,\nis what we're after here.\n\n275\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.430\nSo evidence with regards\nto computer records, right,\n\n276\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.172\nfalls into three categories,\ncomputer-generated evidence,\n\n277\n00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.200\ncomputer-stored evidence,\ncomputer-generated and stored.\n\n278\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.090\nSo if we generate it from the use\nof a computer, that's one category.\n\n279\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.480\nIf we don't necessarily generate it there,\nbut store it there,\n\n280\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.770\nthat's another category.\n\n281\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.520\nOr if we do both,\nthat's the third category.\n\n282\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.780\nImportant for you to know how computer\nevidence and computer records\n\n283\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.590\nare categorized and you should probably\nbe aware of those three categories.\n\n284\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.720\nIf asked, at some point in the future,\nwhether Daniel asks you,\n\n285\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.169\nI ask you or you're sitting in a room with\na computer and a clock and somebody else\n\n286\n00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:23.070\nasks you [LAUGH] You should probably\nbe [LAUGH] aware of that regardless.\n\n287\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.410\nBut if the computer records are stored\nrecords that contain human statements,\n\n288\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.550\nit's important for us to be aware of this.\n\n289\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.920\nThe government has to show\n\n290\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.910\nthat those human statements\nare not inadmissible hearsay.\n\n291\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.120\nInadmissible hearsay is often defined\nas unreliable out of court statements\n\n292\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.398\nmade by a human, as opposed to a dog,\na cat, or a small furry rodent.\n\n293\n00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:45.880\nBut unreliable out of court\nstatements made by a human\n\n294\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.060\nare considered to be inadmissible hearsay.\n\n295\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.850\nWe have to show that they\nare not inadmissible hearsay or\n\n296\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.560\nwe cannot submit them as\nevidence in a court of law.\n\n297\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.530\nAnd we'll get into hearsay and\nall that stuff at some point.\n\n298\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.740\nWe'll talk a bit about it now.\n\n299\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.220\nIt'll come up again at certain points.\n\n300\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.480\nBut we want to understand that just\nbecause we find evidence sitting on\n\n301\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.230\na computer doesn't mean that evidence\nis valid, doesn't mean we can use it.\n\n302\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.420\nIt just means that we've\nbecome aware of it.\n\n303\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.040\nAnd if you remember,\n\n304\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.810\nas we did the demo earlier,\nI showed you that I can recover files.\n\n305\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.180\nThose files may or may not be admissible\nbased on the fact that they may or\n\n306\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.410\nmay not be classified as hearsay.\n\n307\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.390\nWe may not be able to prove beyond\na reasonable doubt, in other words\n\n308\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.590\nthat they are valid, they have validity\nand should be shown in a court of law.\n\n309\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.920\nThat's another set of steps and\nanother hurdle entirely, dependent on and\n\n310\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.280\nseparate from the things we have to\ndo to find them in the first place.\n\n311\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.250\nApplicability of the hearsay rules to\ncomputer stored records is important for\n\n312\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.540\nCHFIs to be aware of.\n\n313\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.050\nAnd you wanna know there are two\nthings we should be aware of here.\n\n314\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.490\nNumber one, computer stored records\ncontaining human statements that\n\n315\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.110\nhave standing must satisfy the exception\nto the hearsay rule if they're offered\n\n316\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.280\nas matters of truth to be attested to.\n\n317\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.190\nMeaning we have to show they are not\nhearsay in order to use them.\n\n318\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.600\nAnd before a court admits those records,\nthe court has to establish that\n\n319\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.790\nthe records do contain statements that\nwere made that will establish and\n\n320\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.440\nensure their trustworthiness.\n\n321\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.380\nIn other words what we cannot\ndo is create something.\n\n322\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.730\nCan we go to my machine here for a sec?\n\n323\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.980\nJust wanna show you potentially\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n324\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.520\nSo, lets just say hypothetically\nthat we do the following.\n\n325\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.000\nWe create a file like this in Notepad,\nand we say that Daniel said\n\n326\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.458\nthat Mike is happy, right?\n\n327\n00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:35.365\nAnd Daniel said,\ndenial as opposed to Daniel.\n\n328\n00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:36.975\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Not just a river in Egypt anymore.\n\n329\n00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:40.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I never claimed I could type.\n\n330\n00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:41.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's now\n\n331\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.105\nend key on this stupid keyboard,\nhave I mentioned how much I hate this?\n\n332\n00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:47.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Daniel said that-\n\n333\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.370\n&gt;&gt; It's entertaining for us though.\n\n334\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.405\n&gt;&gt; Mike said, yeah.\n\n335\n00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:50.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As long as you're having fun,\n\n336\n00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:51.818\nthat's all that matters.\n\n337\n00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:59.286\nDaniel said that Mike said that He's like\na caveman that's just found a computer.\n\n338\n00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:00.424\n[LAUGH] It's hysterical.\n\n339\n00:16:00.424 --> 00:16:01.851\n&gt;&gt; It's not working!\n\n340\n00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:02.731\nWhat is going on?\n\n341\n00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:03.529\n&gt;&gt; Computer no work.\n\n342\n00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:06.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel said that Mike said that Megan\n\n343\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.120\nwas not happy, right?\n\n344\n00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.920\nSo if I have these statements sitting\nhere on a file and I save this, right,\n\n345\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.140\nand I go File and I do Save As and\ngo to the desktop here.\n\n346\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.190\nAnd I call this something like\ndaniel stuff or whatever,\n\n347\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.920\nit doesn't really matter what I call it.\n\n348\n00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.988\nDaniel, st is good enough because I\ncan't really type to save my life.\n\n349\n00:16:26.988 --> 00:16:29.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nif I do this, and I put this here, and\n\n350\n00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.210\nI have this file sitting here.\n\n351\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.670\nAnd then I go ahead and\nI gather this evidence,\n\n352\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.580\nI have to show that the statements in\nthat file are not hearsay evidence for\n\n353\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.700\nthem to be applicable.\n\n354\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.680\nIn other words, for\nme to be able to sit in a court of law and\n\n355\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.830\ntestify to the fact that Daniel said Mike\nis happy, and that Daniel said that Mike\n\n356\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.280\nsaid that Megan was not happy, I would\nhave to show that those statements are not\n\n357\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.430\nhearsay, but rather direct information\nthat I can validate and is trustworthy.\n\n358\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.840\nOr I cannot submit them as\nevidence because essentially,\n\n359\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.430\nwe don't have a way of validating them.\n\n360\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.710\nHow do I know what Daniel said.\n\n361\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.920\nAnd how do I know that what Daniel\nsaid that Mike said is also accurate?\n\n362\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.140\nThere's no way to know that.\n\n363\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.030\nThat's clearly conjecture and\nhypothetical, and\n\n364\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.820\nit's what we would call hearsay.\n\n365\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.130\nSo finding evidence like this on a machine\n\n366\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.860\ndoesn't guarantee that I'm\ngonna be able to use it.\n\n367\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.560\nIt simply is evidence that's there that\nI have to then weigh and understand.\n\n368\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.060\nAnd the hearsay rule with regards\nto computer stored records,\n\n369\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.360\nspeaks to this exact thing.\n\n370\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.870\nNow let's extrapolate, let's talk about\nthis in the real world for a minute.\n\n371\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.190\nSo, we're not just talking about hey,\nthere's a text document and by the way,\n\n372\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.990\nDaniel may or may not, and Mike may or\nmay not have said these things.\n\n373\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:43.420\nBut rather, let's assume we find an email,\nor chain of emails, or I find Word\n\n374\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.890\ndocuments or who knows what that pertain\nto some sort of exchange of communication.\n\n375\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:54.070\nI may or, I find a chat record, right,\nfrom let's say a link or Skype.\n\n376\n00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.640\nOr I find a record of some SMS\nmessages that have been transcribed\n\n377\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.730\nbetween individuals.\n\n378\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.460\nThere's all sorts of ways to do this.\n\n379\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.800\nIf I'm thinking about this, I have to,\nin order to submit that information,\n\n380\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.560\nhave it be seen as valid evidence in\na court, have to prove that that stuff\n\n381\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.505\nis not just random hearsay, but\nrather actually, trustworthy verifiable\n\n382\n00:18:13.505 --> 00:18:17.435\ncommunications that I can rely on, or I\nwill not be able to submit that evidence.\n\n383\n00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:20.565\nAnd this is very important because\nthe hearsay rule is designed specifically\n\n384\n00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:25.535\nto protect us, meaning, the court and\nthe individuals from being\n\n385\n00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:28.485\ndiscriminated against,\nin the sense of being falsely accused,\n\n386\n00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:31.810\nby people making things up and saying that\nsomebody said something when they didn't.\n\n387\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.790\nYou ever played telephone\nwhen you were a kid?\n\n388\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a fun game.\n\n389\n00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:38.320\n&gt;&gt; So, telephone starts out with me\nsaying something to somebody, and\n\n390\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.670\nthen you kind of makes the way around.\n\n391\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.820\nSo, you start out with hey we're\ngonna stop after the end of the show,\n\n392\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.950\nand it makes it way through everybody, and\nit winds up being hey we're going out for\n\n393\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.590\ndrinks at 5 o'clock.\n\n394\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.760\nThat's not what I said, but\nit gets transformed in other words,\n\n395\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.170\nand it gets added to and modify.\n\n396\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.540\nWell the problem is that when you do that,\nthat data,\n\n397\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.500\nthat evidence that shows up at the end,\nis nothing like what we started with.\n\n398\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.165\nAnd we can't submit the final statement\nas valid proof of what I said initially.\n\n399\n00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:08.030\nCuz it clearly is different.\n\n400\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.140\nAnd this is what the hearsay\nrule is designed to prevent.\n\n401\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.530\nSo I want to make sure we're aware of this\nand we understand this because this is\n\n402\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.930\nvery important from our perspective as\ninstructions to us as investigators.\n\n403\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.630\nIf we are not clear on the provenance of\nevidence, we may not be able to use it,\n\n404\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.220\nand that's something we\nhave to think about.\n\n405\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.280\nThe courts have been\nvery specific about it.\n\n406\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.050\nHearsay is not acceptable and\nnot be inadmissible in the court of law,\n\n407\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.490\nwith very few exceptions.\n\n408\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.690\nThere are some exceptions for business\nrecords and some other things that wee\n\n409\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.370\nwill talk about, and that are seen as\nbeing outside the boundary of hearsay,\n\n410\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.910\neven though we may not be\nable to define them directly.\n\n411\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.050\nSo we do want to understand that,\nand we'll come back to that later.\n\n412\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.910\nChallenges to the authenticity of computer\nrecords can be taken on as I've been\n\n413\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:47.420\ndescribing.\n\n414\n00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.280\nAnd we want to understand there\nare three different ways potentially\n\n415\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.430\nwe could challenge the authenticity\nof computer records.\n\n416\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.542\nNumber one, we can challenge the\nauthenticity of the computer-generated and\n\n417\n00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:00.500\ncomputer-stored records by\nquestioning whether those records,\n\n418\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.140\nas I implied, were altered in some way,\nmanipulated, or damaged after creation.\n\n419\n00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.320\nI showed you that I created the text file\nand that may or may not be accurate.\n\n420\n00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.370\nWe talked about the concept of playing\ntelephone and the data being modified.\n\n421\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.010\nThere's different ways of showing this.\n\n422\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.470\nI can challenge in other words,\nthe claim, the assertion that,\n\n423\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.320\nthat record accurately\nrepresents information.\n\n424\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.190\nBecause if I can show it was modified,\n\n425\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.000\nI can show that it may have been\nmanipulated and it may not be accurate.\n\n426\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.920\nNumber two, parties can question\nthe authenticity of records\n\n427\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.740\ngenerated by challenging the reliability\nof the program that generates the record.\n\n428\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.660\nHey, maybe that computer program\nis not working the right way.\n\n429\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.260\nMaybe it randomly inserts\ndata into the system.\n\n430\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.990\nAnd if it does that, how do I know that\nthe stuff that's in there is accurate?\n\n431\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.470\nSo if I could show that the program\ndoesn't work the right way,\n\n432\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.190\nI can challenge the validity and the\nassumption that the data should be used.\n\n433\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.660\nSecond way I could do that.\n\n434\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.560\nThird way, we could challenge authenticity\nby questioning the identity of the author.\n\n435\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.570\nHow do you know it was really\nme that created that text file?\n\n436\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.590\nHow do we know it wasn't Daniel doing\nit just trying to manipulate and\n\n437\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.640\nhide what was or was not accurate?\n\n438\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.720\nOr maybe it was Don or\nsomebody else, right?\n\n439\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.330\nWe don't know who actually did it.\n\n440\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.360\nThere's no way to attribute it directly.\n\n441\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.910\nIf we can't attribute it\ndirectly to an individual\n\n442\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.180\nwe may be able to challenge\nthat assumption as well.\n\n443\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.080\nThere's three distinct ways that\nwe can challenge the authenticity\n\n444\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.960\nof computer records.\n\n445\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.530\nIt'll be important for\nyou to know what they are.\n\n446\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.550\nWe just went through them.\n\n447\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.550\nCan you list them backwards\nstanding on one arm and one leg?\n\n448\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.250\n&gt;&gt; No problem because I have\nthem right in front of me.\n\n449\n00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.020\nIt says parties may challenge\nthe authenticity of computer\n\n450\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.900\nstored records by questioning\nthe identity of the author.\n\n451\n00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.940\nParties may question the,\nI can't say that word, authenticity.\n\n452\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.510\n&gt;&gt; That's horrible.\n\n453\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.420\n&gt;&gt; See I can say it.\n\n454\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.840\nI just have to sound it out, right.\n\n455\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.285\nI went to third grade at least, right.\n\n456\n00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:40.347\nAll right, close enough, close enough.\n\n457\n00:21:40.347 --> 00:21:43.170\nAll right, so just some important\ninformation for us, right,\n\n458\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.660\nto think about as we're\nkind of wrapping up and\n\n459\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.620\nthinking about closing out\nour discussions in this area.\n\n460\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.100\nAny questions, thoughts, observations?\n\n461\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.091\n&gt;&gt; No, it's just I think these are very\ngood for us to consider because\n\n462\n00:21:54.091 --> 00:21:56.920\n&gt;&gt; We do have checks and\n\n463\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.730\nbalances put into place for\nthe gathering of evidence.\n\n464\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:04.340\nAnd we also have protections against\nabuses of the gathering of evidence and\n\n465\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.190\nthat's, that's really what we're getting\nto and it all comes down to the end of\n\n466\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.330\nthe day we're all trying to gather\nevidence that will Support a case.\n\n467\n00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.250\nThat's the culmination of what this whole\nsection has been about, all these four\n\n468\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:20.460\nparts, is how do we get to the evidence\nthat's going to say this is what happened?\n\n469\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.420\nAnd do it in a way that doesn't damage\npeople's rights and privileges and\n\n470\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.430\nthings of that nature,\nand do it truthfully.\n\n471\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.580\nThat's what we want to do.\n\n472\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.180\nAnd I think that's what we've gotten to\nhere at the very end, making sure that If\n\n473\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.340\nsomeone comes up and says, I have evidence\nthat says, you did something wrong.\n\n474\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.280\nAnd I know that I didn't\ndo anything wrong.\n\n475\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.090\nI have recourse to take that says,\nhey, well, let me question that.\n\n476\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.090\nLet's put that to the test and\nsee if it holds water.\n\n477\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.380\nAnd that's why we have both system,\nsystems aware that can gather evidence.\n\n478\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.900\nAnd systems for us to be able to make\nsure that the evidence is pointing to\n\n479\n00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.550\nthe truth of the matter, and\nnot just what they've interpreted it as.\n\n480\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.780\n&gt;&gt; So why can't we all just get along?\n\n481\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.880\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question?\n\n482\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n483\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.900\n&gt;&gt; We are not going to answer it here.\n\n484\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.270\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But it is a good question.\n\n485\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.550\nAll right so this is probably a good place\nfor us to wrap up our conversations.\n\n486\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.560\nIn this particular air,\nas I remind you, and\n\n487\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.440\nwe will certainly be coming back to,\nlots more.\n\n488\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.320\nLots, lots more stuff to talk about.\n\n489\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.120\nI think I rattled through some things.\n\n490\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.800\nDigital evidence is going to come up.\n\n491\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.660\nHow we handle being a first responder,\nhow we deal with setting up a forensics\n\n492\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.600\nlab among many other many other topics\nwe're gonna go through and talk about.\n\n493\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.200\nReally want you to come back and\nsee more of this with us.\n\n494\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.900\nI encourage you to come back and do so.\n\n495\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.240\nAnd at any point in time,\nwhenever you view any of these episodes,\n\n496\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.040\nespecially if you're maybe dabbling here\nand there, going a little bit out of\n\n497\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.400\norder, keep in mind that some of\nthe foundational knowledge we've laid down\n\n498\n00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.820\nIn our very beginning conversations\nabout what forensics today looks like\n\n499\n00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.230\nis a great place for you to start before\nyou jump into the middle of the pool.\n\n500\n00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:47.940\nSo you have the background and\nperspective of some\n\n501\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:55.810\nof the things we're starting to talk about\nmore and more as we fill in the gaps.\n\n502\n00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.630\nSigning off for\nITPROTV I've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n503\n00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.654\n&gt;&gt; I am a.\n\n504\n00:24:01.654 --> 00:24:04.633\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n505\n00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:10.200\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n[MUSIC]\n\n506\n00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

00:00:09.796\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:12.468\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:16.150\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.040\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.800\nAnd in this episode we're continuing\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.461\nJoining us back in the studio,\nyet again, is our good friend and\n\n9\n00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.670\nmentor Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.430\nAdam, welcome back and\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.652\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, going well,\ngoing well, excited.\n\n12\n00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:32.430\nGreen day today, green for good.\n\n13\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Very minty.\n\n14\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthat is a great way of looking at it.\n\n15\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.570\nIt is a very minty day today.\n\n16\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.620\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go with that as the theme.\n\n17\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.650\nSo here at refreshing ITProTV, we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about digital evidence.\n\n18\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.310\nThat's gonna be the subject of\nat least this conversation,\n\n19\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.570\nwith regards to our continuing foray, our\nvoyage into the wonderful world of CHFI.\n\n20\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.550\nSo as you think about being\na digital investigator, or\n\n21\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.360\na forensics investigator focused in the\ndigital space, we've talked a lot about\n\n22\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.160\nthe need to be aware of information that\ncan impact your investigations, right?\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.530\nAwareness of the crime scene,\nawareness of methodology, so\n\n24\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.610\nfollowing the rules of evidence.\n\n25\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.930\nFollowing things and\n\n26\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.960\nbeing aware of things, such as any legal\nrequirements like the hearsay rule.\n\n27\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560\nWe spoke about that in one\nof our prior episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340\nAwareness of the policies that may be in\n\n29\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.910\nplace in the workplace if\nyou're investigating there.\n\n30\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.330\nWe had a pretty interesting conversation,\none of our prior shows, about whether or\n\n31\n00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.310\nnot we could search something\nlike a backpack, right, or\n\n32\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.590\nwhatever it may be that\nbelongs to an individual.\n\n33\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.810\nWhen you're on site, working for a company\nand you're asked to do an investigation.\n\n34\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.780\nAnd so these kinds of things impact\nour ability to be able to do our job.\n\n35\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.960\nBut in addition we also have to\nthink about what evidence may be.\n\n36\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380\nWhat evidence looks like,\nwhere it may be found.\n\n37\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.350\nWe've talked a little about and\ndone a demo for\n\n38\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.750\nyou, on the fact that things are not\nalways what they appear to be.\n\n39\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.740\nSomebody deletes data,\ndoesn't mean it's not there,\n\n40\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.390\ndoesn't mean we can't get it back.\n\n41\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.680\nIt just simply means that we\nhave to know where to look, and\n\n42\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.850\nhave to be aware of the fact that data\nmay not always simply just be sitting\n\n43\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.280\nin the file system where\nwe expect it to be.\n\n44\n00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.020\nAnd we may have to use\nspecial tools to find it.\n\n45\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.700\nSo we have to think about these kind\nof things as we begin our conversations\n\n46\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.430\nwith regards to digital evidence.\n\n47\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.940\nDigital evidence is specifically\nsomething we have to define.\n\n48\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.460\nSo Daniel,\n\n49\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.310\nlet's as we often do, start out by talking\nabout what something may or may not be.\n\n50\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.890\nYou've been really helpful at helping us\nto figure out a lot of these definitions,\n\n51\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.760\nor offering us a thought process\nthat helps to build on that.\n\n52\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.990\nSo when we talk about evidence in general,\nright, whether it's digital or not.\n\n53\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.814\nBut when we talk about evidence in\ngeneral, we often speak about things\n\n54\n00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:43.510\nthat are gonna be important to us to\neither prove that something did or\n\n55\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.119\ndid not happen a certain way.\n\n56\n00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:50.160\nOr to prove that somebody or something\nwas or was not in a certain place.\n\n57\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.700\nSo we go down the list of sorta\nall the things evidence may or\n\n58\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.040\nmay not be able to do.\n\n59\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.370\nDoes digital evidence behave differently?\n\n60\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.469\nIs digital evidence different in any\nsignificant way from your perspective or\n\n61\n00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.718\nis evidence evidence?\n\n62\n00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:02.469\nWhat do you think?\n\n63\n00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n64\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.410\nI'm going to say that digital\nevidence is kind of its own monster.\n\n65\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.020\nJust because digital material in and\n\n66\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.240\nof itself, if I can use that word,\nits digital,\n\n67\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.560\nit intangible but It's something that we\nuse, it's different than other things.\n\n68\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.490\nLike if I had a paper document\nversus a digital document,\n\n69\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.810\nthe attributes of each are extremely\ndifferent, even though they\n\n70\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.950\nbasically give you the same information\nif they were the same document that is.\n\n71\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.940\nSo I would say yeah, it its own\nentity it has to be treated as such.\n\n72\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.390\n&gt;&gt; All right and so Daniel is not\n100% right, he's also not 100% wrong.\n\n73\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.560\nHe's actually very accurate in what he\nsays but we have to tweak his statement,\n\n74\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.750\nhis definition just a little bit.\n\n75\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.138\nSo he's right to point out that yeah,\ndigital data,\n\n76\n00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:54.108\ndigital information as you said, whatever\nit may be, is kinda it's own thing\n\n77\n00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:58.577\nin the respect that it is information\nstored in a unique medium or way.\n\n78\n00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:01.600\nAnd that's kinda the entry point we\nwant to focus on here for a minute.\n\n79\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.740\nDaniel's also absolutely correct\nin the fact that he says hey,\n\n80\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.330\nif I had a document in theory,\nlet's call it the old style document,\n\n81\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.940\nthe paper document, an analog document.\n\n82\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.820\nJust cuz generically it's\nan easy way to refer to things.\n\n83\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.030\nAnd if we think of an analog document\nthat is maybe our school homework, right?\n\n84\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.900\nAnd it's supposed to be our\ngeography report for Mr.\n\n85\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.830\nJohnson, our geography teacher.\n\n86\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.340\nAnd if we have a digital version of that,\nmaybe it's a pdf or a Word document,\n\n87\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.420\nand the 2 are identical as Daniel\nindicated they very well could be,\n\n88\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.990\nin terms of the information\ncontained within them.\n\n89\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.250\nNot the form but\n\n90\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.850\nthe substance in other words as Daniel\nwas suggesting, would be the same.\n\n91\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.630\nHe's right to say\nthe substance of the material,\n\n92\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.090\nthe actual information\nitself Is gonna be the same.\n\n93\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.180\nIt's not gonna be different.\n\n94\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.970\nIt's gonna say, Mr. Johnson,\ntoday's date, room number five,\n\n95\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.160\nperiod one,\nhere's where our information is.\n\n96\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.550\nThat's gonna look and\nfeel essentially the same.\n\n97\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.570\nWhat's gonna be different is the medium,\nthe mechanism we use to store the data,\n\n98\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.270\nto access it, to manipulate it and\nalso to create it.\n\n99\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.590\nBecause as Daniel had said,\nyou know, digital data, you know,\n\n100\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.620\nit's gonna be different, right?\n\n101\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.840\nIt's a different monster,\nI think is the initial term you used.\n\n102\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.610\nIt's a different monster, and\n\n103\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.260\nas a result we have to think\nabout that as a Investigator.\n\n104\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.110\nBecause if I asked Daniel hey, can you\nget me that copy of that analog document?\n\n105\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.270\nHe may walk over to his backpack, and\nopen it up pull out a three-ring binder,\n\n106\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.120\na folder, whatever it is.\n\n107\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.150\nAnd he may just hand\nme the piece of paper.\n\n108\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.520\nOr he may go and\nmake a photocopy of it, right.\n\n109\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.540\nHe may go and scan it or do something and\nbe able to give me a reproduction of it.\n\n110\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.584\nBut initially it's just a piece of\npaper and it could be stored anywhere,\n\n111\n00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:48.900\nin theory, anywhere.\n\n112\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.930\nBut it crumpled up under the seat of\nyour car, it could be anywhere, right?\n\n113\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.873\nThe dog ate my homework.\n\n114\n00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:53.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You bring the dog in,\n\n115\n00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:55.260\nhere's my homework, right?\n\n116\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.020\nThat kind of thing.\n\n117\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.170\nSo, whatever it is,\nit's going to be in a specific form and\n\n118\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.800\nhave certain attributes,\nas Daniel suggested and\n\n119\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.680\nthe specific word he used, it's going\nto have attributes associated with it.\n\n120\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.670\nWhereas the digital\nform is also gonna have\n\n121\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.490\ncertain attributes associated with it.\n\n122\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.753\nAnd we have to think about something\nwe spoke about already, and\n\n123\n00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:20.743\nsomething I actually demonstrated for\nyou in one of our prior conversations,\n\n124\n00:06:20.743 --> 00:06:23.905\nthe concept of meta data associated\nwith the digital format.\n\n125\n00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:27.143\nBecause we're gonna have\ninformation that we may or\n\n126\n00:06:27.143 --> 00:06:29.725\nmay not have access to in the analog form.\n\n127\n00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:34.488\nFor instance, when the document was\ncreated, on what computer and/or\n\n128\n00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:39.327\nwhat program that was used, the name\nof the person that did the creating,\n\n129\n00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:44.032\nthe number of times the program may\nhave been used to edit the document.\n\n130\n00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:48.828\nKey words associated with the flow of data\nin the document may be there as part of\n\n131\n00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:50.050\nthe metadata.\n\n132\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.130\nAll of this is part of the attributes that\nis associated with the digital version\n\n133\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.110\nof the data.\n\n134\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.654\nAnd as well, we're going to have to\nthink about the program to use to\n\n135\n00:06:59.654 --> 00:07:01.900\ncreate the data, the file type.\n\n136\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.071\nI've shown you through manipulation\nin one of our prior little show and\n\n137\n00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.407\ntell episodes that we actually\nhave the ability to change\n\n138\n00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:13.555\nthe substance of the data, no,\nbut change the style essentially.\n\n139\n00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:16.715\nThe representation of the data,\nyes, we can do that.\n\n140\n00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:20.990\nI took a word document, change it into\na text file by essentially changing\n\n141\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.780\nThe extension, and I showed you\nthe icon that represents the change.\n\n142\n00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.530\nI showed you the listing and the file\nlist inside windows explorer change, but\n\n143\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.400\nwhen we went in and we looked,\n\n144\n00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.250\nwe saw the data itself,\nthe substance of the data had not changed.\n\n145\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.050\nBut the metadata around\nit had been modified.\n\n146\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.625\nAnd so these kinds of things are things\nwe start to think about as we think about\n\n147\n00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:41.567\ndigital evidence.\n\n148\n00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:45.126\nIt was was a lot easier back in the day\nwhere you wrote everything out by hand,\n\n149\n00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:49.074\nyou ripped it off the paper, pulled it out\nof the notebook, gave it to your teacher,\n\n150\n00:07:49.074 --> 00:07:50.290\nput your name on it.\n\n151\n00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.438\nIt was pretty much yeah,\nI did it and this is what it was.\n\n152\n00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:57.571\nNow, could we tell that you had done\nthe homework for somebody else and\n\n153\n00:07:57.571 --> 00:07:59.268\njust wrote their name on it?\n\n154\n00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:03.724\nProbably not unless we analyze the\nhandwriting, unless we were leaving behind\n\n155\n00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:07.260\ntell tell signs that maybe\nsomebody else has done the work.\n\n156\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.602\nMaybe the style of\nthe writing was different.\n\n157\n00:08:09.602 --> 00:08:13.520\nSo maybe as a result,\nteacher goes say, hey, wait a second.\n\n158\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.910\nAdam doesn't normally write like this.\n\n159\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.673\nWhat's going on?\n\n160\n00:08:15.673 --> 00:08:20.040\nAnd all of a sudden we say well maybe\nsomebody did Adam's homework for him.\n\n161\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.880\nNot that that would have ever happened,\nI did my own homework.\n\n162\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.874\nWhich is why I'm able to stand here and\ntalk about homework with you today.\n\n163\n00:08:25.874 --> 00:08:29.760\nIf I had not done my own homework, what\nwould I stand here and talk about now?\n\n164\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.452\n&gt;&gt; How to not do homework, that would be\nthe only topic you'd have expertise on.\n\n165\n00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:34.745\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to talk about something else,\n\n166\n00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:36.120\nbecause I wouldn't know what to say.\n\n167\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.130\nThis is why you should stay in school and\ndo homework.\n\n168\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.928\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n169\n00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:39.990\n[LAUGH] So\n\n170\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.960\nthe reality is that there are always going\nto be these tell tale signs potentially,\n\n171\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.170\nbut it may be hard to understand them,\nidentify them, pull them out.\n\n172\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.380\nWhen we're not talking about digital\ndata that has these properties,\n\n173\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.540\nthese attributes, this metadata\nthat may be associated with it.\n\n174\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.560\nI'm not suggesting that just\nbecause metadata exists,\n\n175\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.140\nthat the metadata itself is\nenough to identify these things.\n\n176\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.445\nOr that that metadata cannot be modified\nbecause we've shown you that we\n\n177\n00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:07.410\ncan modify the metadata as well.\n\n178\n00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.050\nIn part of the demonstration I did,\nI think I actually added you,\n\n179\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.010\nright if I'm not mistaken.\n\n180\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.860\nI think I added you the Word document and\nI put you in there as an author.\n\n181\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.060\nAnd I show that we could modify\nthe metadata in real time and\n\n182\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.020\nthat those attributes then would stick.\n\n183\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.670\nThey would stay with the data, we close\nthe document out, opening it back up.\n\n184\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.610\nAnd Daniel was listed\nas one of the authors,\n\n185\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.050\neven though he had not actually\never touched the document, right?\n\n186\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.890\nHe was just essentially\nwatching the whole time.\n\n187\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.530\nAnd yet I put him down as an author and\nmade it clear, or\n\n188\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.380\nat least in terms of just interpreting\nthe metadata, implied, right,\n\n189\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.000\nthat Daniel had been involved in\nthe creation of that document.\n\n190\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.024\nWhen in fact, we know he had not been.\n\n191\n00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:46.298\nSo these kind of things are challenges\nthat face us when we start to\n\n192\n00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:51.020\ninvestigate and start to examine\ndigital data as an investigator.\n\n193\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.400\nAnd so\nthese are the things you want to think of.\n\n194\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.930\nDigital evidence essentially, is any\ninformation that has probative value,\n\n195\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.170\nwe've talked about\nthe word probative before.\n\n196\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.860\nProbative value that is stored or\ntransmitted in digital format.\n\n197\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.027\nAnd so there is a difference in the sense\nthat we focus on the creation stored in\n\n198\n00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:08.320\ntransmission medium.\n\n199\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.430\nWhat we call the data lifecycle, right?\n\n200\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.550\nData in use, data in applications,\nif you will, data on the wire,\n\n201\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.810\nsometimes called data in transit,\nsending back and forth.\n\n202\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.800\nAnd then data at rest, data in storage,\ndata sitting on a hard drive, data\n\n203\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.910\nsitting on a storage area network, data\nout on a NAS, wherever the data may be.\n\n204\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.510\nWhatever form it may take.\n\n205\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.550\nWe talk about digital evidence\nas being involved, and\n\n206\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.640\nencompassing, data across\nthe data lifecycle.\n\n207\n00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.125\nSo, it's important for you to be\nthinking about that, as we get started.\n\n208\n00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:41.780\nDoes data that is stored on a USB device,\n\n209\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.140\nthat has not been accessed in three years,\nqualify as digital evidence?\n\n210\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.760\nIt may, depending on the circumstances\nof the case we're involved with.\n\n211\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.430\nIf we want to know what's\non that USB drive,\n\n212\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.480\nthen anything there\npotentially can be evidence.\n\n213\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.810\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n214\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.220\nSo there are a lot of things to\nknow about digital evidence,\n\n215\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.890\nthere are also a lot of challenges.\n\n216\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.310\nHow good is that data,\n\n217\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.720\nin terms of its viability,\non that device from three years ago?\n\n218\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.620\nHas that device sat in somebody's\nglove compartment for three years,\n\n219\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.580\nright, in their car, baking or frozen?\n\n220\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.350\nWho knows what kind of\nconditions the car was in?\n\n221\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.432\nHas that device been immersed in water?\n\n222\n00:11:16.432 --> 00:11:19.120\nHas somebody thrown it around,\n\n223\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.530\nrun over it, tossed it out the side of the\nwindow when they're going down the road?\n\n224\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.790\nWho knows what they would\nhave done with it, right?\n\n225\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.730\nAnd as a result, the evidence left\non that device, may or may not\n\n226\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:36.330\nbe in a good shape, essentially it may not\nbe in a good way and as a result of that.\n\n227\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.430\nWe may have a problem with\nthe quality of the data,\n\n228\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.840\nand our ability to understand\nwhat the data represents.\n\n229\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.850\nAnd also, to present that data in a formal\nway, either in an investigation, or\n\n230\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.650\npotentially, as we end up, as we say\nwe often may, a trial at some point.\n\n231\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.300\nAnd so we have to think about some of\nthe challenges that digital evidence\n\n232\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.100\nmay present.\n\n233\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.220\nWe've talked about the issues associated\nwith data remnants on drives a little bit.\n\n234\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.870\nThere's data left behind,\nwe try to grab that data, pull it in.\n\n235\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.940\nBut what bout data that's been compromised\nbecause we attempted to erase it, but\n\n236\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.430\nwe didn't do a very good job?\n\n237\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.520\nHow much of the fragmentary data\nthat's left can we rely on?\n\n238\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.860\nHow much of that can we\nstitch back together again?\n\n239\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.820\nWhat if somebody attempts to remove any\ntraces of the data by using chemicals to\n\n240\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.900\netch the platter, the actual spinning part\nof the hard drive or the magnetic media?\n\n241\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.082\nWhat if they take the SD card,\nwhich doesn't have moving parts,\n\n242\n00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:32.127\nessentially is just a ship that\nstores information in memory.\n\n243\n00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:35.365\nBut what if we take that and\nwe subject it to high heat?\n\n244\n00:12:35.365 --> 00:12:40.920\nWhich potentially could modify the storage\ncapacity of the device, and ruin the data.\n\n245\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.760\nThere's all these things\nthat could be done.\n\n246\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.400\nMost people don't walk around with access\nto thermite or a gas furnace, furnace?\n\n247\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.730\nA gas thermos.\n\n248\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.414\nA gas furnace,\nthat's the third one I was gonna try.\n\n249\n00:12:49.414 --> 00:12:51.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Third time's always the charm.\n\n250\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:56.280\nA gas furnace where they can liquefy\nthat kind of a storage medium, right?\n\n251\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.640\nWe say the only true way to destroy\ndata in terms of physical storage,\n\n252\n00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.510\nwould be to actually either melt it, so\nthrow it into something that burns as\n\n253\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.420\nhot as a gas furnace, couple of thousand\ndegrees will typically melt anything.\n\n254\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.540\nOr strap a block of thermite to it.\n\n255\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.360\nAnd when you set off a plasma charge,\nthat's basically all she wrote.\n\n256\n00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.020\nWe should put one of those videos up,\nby the way.\n\n257\n00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.185\nYou were talking about videos one of our\nother episodes, the 80s commercial vault,\n\n258\n00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:24.625\nand all the cool stuff you should\nlike Google thermite destruction.\n\n259\n00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:25.646\n&gt;&gt; I keep thermite just at the house.\n\n260\n00:13:25.646 --> 00:13:26.955\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at some of those videos.\n\n261\n00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:29.157\n&gt;&gt; You never know when you\ngotta get rid of some evidence.\n\n262\n00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:30.849\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cause that's what you need.\n\n263\n00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:33.789\n&gt;&gt; It's going to burn through the top\nof a car, through the engine block,\n\n264\n00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:36.729\ndown to the bottom, and go all the way\nthrough because it burns like 2 or\n\n265\n00:13:36.729 --> 00:13:39.135\n3000 degrees and\njust melts right through the metal.\n\n266\n00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:39.855\n&gt;&gt; Liquid plasma.\n\n267\n00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:41.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty nasty stuff.\n\n268\n00:13:41.017 --> 00:13:41.951\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n269\n00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:43.762\n&gt;&gt; Not the kinda things\nyou want to handle and\n\n270\n00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:47.355\nthen still plan on having your fingers\nafter you're done if you're not careful.\n\n271\n00:13:47.355 --> 00:13:48.362\n&gt;&gt; Your violin career is over.\n\n272\n00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:51.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes definitely, you're done.\n\n273\n00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:54.345\nBut I've had military students\nin a lot of my classes and\n\n274\n00:13:54.345 --> 00:13:57.880\ndone a lot of work with people\nin the military over the years.\n\n275\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.680\nDo a lot of training for\nthe government and the military.\n\n276\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.490\nAnd I've heard stories from some of these\nguys that are stationed in some crazy\n\n277\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.420\nplaces.\n\n278\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:11.020\nOr in some highly specific\ncircumstances where basically,\n\n279\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.490\nthey get the order and regardless of\nwhat's happening, everything in that\n\n280\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.830\nroom has to be destroyed because of the\nsensitive nature of what they're doing.\n\n281\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.625\nAnd these guys, literally,\ntheir destruction chart is typically\n\n282\n00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:24.070\na thermite chart is strapped\nto the side of a cabinet.\n\n283\n00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.440\nAnd to get the order they got to\nset this thing off and leave and\n\n284\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.030\nit just melts everything.\n\n285\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.929\n&gt;&gt; There is such a thing as\na fire safe which people,\n\n286\n00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:32.087\nyeah I know what a fire safe is.\n\n287\n00:14:32.087 --> 00:14:33.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you open it up and it blows.\n\n288\n00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:34.890\n&gt;&gt; And everything burns.\n\n289\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.727\nYeah it's the opposite of what\nyou would think it would be or\n\n290\n00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:37.516\nto protect it from fire.\n\n291\n00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:39.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's not a fire proof safe,\nit's a safe that causes fire.\n\n292\n00:14:39.668 --> 00:14:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's got a chemical charge\n\n293\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:43.820\nassociated with it.\n\n294\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.520\nYou open the door without putting in the\nright code or the right sequence to disarm\n\n295\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.830\nthe charge and everything inside\nis automatically destroyed.\n\n296\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.430\nWhich is obviously good if you're the\nperson trying to keep the evidence safe,\n\n297\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.650\nbad if you're the person\nwho is paid to get it.\n\n298\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.843\nThat's also an RGE event but\nfor a different reason [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:15:00.843 --> 00:15:03.523\nAll right, so\nwhen we think about digital evidence,\n\n300\n00:15:03.523 --> 00:15:07.213\nwe want to think about the fact that one\nof the biggest challenges we have as\n\n301\n00:15:07.213 --> 00:15:11.280\ninvestigators is making sure the evidence\nis good, that we actually can use it.\n\n302\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.850\nThat when we find it,\nas we've often talked about,\n\n303\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.200\nwe find it in who knows what shape,\nwhat condition.\n\n304\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.250\nWe just don't know.\n\n305\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.750\nWe're not gonna know until we analyze it.\n\n306\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.050\nBut the point is, we have to take\nsteps from the very beginning\n\n307\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.270\nto ensure the safety, the veracity\nof that evidence, has to be ensured.\n\n308\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.470\nAnd we have to make sure we operate\nforensically in a sound way.\n\n309\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.760\nWe observe as we talked about,\nchain of custody.\n\n310\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.655\nWe follow the rules of engagement.\n\n311\n00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:39.550\nWe've talked about the fact that there\nare seven B's associated with the rules of\n\n312\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.450\nforensic investigation, and/or\nthe characteristics of digital evidence.\n\n313\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.550\nI recited them for\n\n314\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:50.020\nyou in a couple of different areas\nduring our initial discussions.\n\n315\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.569\nDo you remember any of the seven B's?\n\n316\n00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Be relevant.\n\n317\n00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.924\n&gt;&gt; Be relevant's actually the first one.\n\n318\n00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:56.260\nSo be relevant is good.\n\n319\n00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.296\nSo we have be relevant.\n\n320\n00:15:57.296 --> 00:15:58.820\nWe have be probative.\n\n321\n00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.475\nBe authentic.\n\n322\n00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:00.680\nBe accurate.\n\n323\n00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.037\nBe complete, be convincing, be admissible.\n\n324\n00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:05.675\nAnd for those of you from the 70s and\n80s, be Arthur.\n\n325\n00:16:05.675 --> 00:16:06.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Be Arthur.\n\n326\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.044\n&gt;&gt; Not one of the seven Bs.\n\n327\n00:16:08.044 --> 00:16:09.101\nYou remember Maude?\n\n328\n00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.027\n&gt;&gt; I love the Golden Girls,\n[CROSSTALK] awesome.\n\n329\n00:16:11.027 --> 00:16:12.143\n&gt;&gt; Golden Girls, but you remember Maude?\n\n330\n00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:13.480\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, little bit.\n\n331\n00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that was like the big thing.\n\n332\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.710\nOf course,\nshe was on the Golden Girls years later.\n\n333\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.140\n&gt;&gt; Right before my time.\n\n334\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.690\n&gt;&gt; Little bit before, little bit before.\n\n335\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, so remember the seven Bs.\n\n336\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.380\nI wanna make sure you remember those.\n\n337\n00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.780\nThose are gonna help us to\nunderstand to frame the conversation\n\n338\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.840\nwith regards to how we approach\nforensic investigations.\n\n339\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.599\nHow we approach the characteristics\nof digit 11 helps us to understand\n\n340\n00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:35.900\nan approach digit 11.\n\n341\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.220\nSo in the evidence we\ngather should be relevant.\n\n342\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.190\nIt should be probative.\n\n343\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:43.730\nIt should show and have some value\nunique and associated to the case.\n\n344\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.950\nIt should be authentic.\n\n345\n00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.740\nRight, it should be accurate,\nshould be complete, should be convincing.\n\n346\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.390\nShould of course,\n\n347\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.150\nalways, without exception,\ntry to be admissible in a court of law.\n\n348\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.380\nWe've also talked about Locard's\nexchange principle before,\n\n349\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.980\nwanted to remind you of this.\n\n350\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.930\nIf we could go to my machine for\njust a moment.\n\n351\n00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.940\nThought it would be good just to bring\nup a way for you to actually see\n\n352\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.430\nthe principle, as opposed to just hearing\nme talk about it in a prior show.\n\n353\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:12.330\nAll I did was go out, went to Google,\nsearched Locard's Principle or\n\n354\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.230\nLocard's Exchange Principle.\n\n355\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.120\nAnd I took the link for the Forensic\nHandbook, as you can see that came up.\n\n356\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.910\nDaniel will make sure he has\nthis in the show notes for you.\n\n357\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.370\nAnd you could see a picture of Dr.\nLocard there and\n\n358\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.280\nyou could see that he was as, I think,\nI talked about when I mentioned it before.\n\n359\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.180\nBecame famous as a criminalist for\nbeing able to understand this idea\n\n360\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.890\nthat people that commit crimes will\nalways leave something behind and\n\n361\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.110\nalways take something with them.\n\n362\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.900\nAnd this idea of the exchange,\nif we could focus on that and\n\n363\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.850\nwe can figure out what they\ntook with them, what's missing.\n\n364\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.730\nIn other words, what they left behind\nwhat they added, fingerprints,\n\n365\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.350\nDNA, whatever it is.\n\n366\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.320\nIf we could figure those things out,\nwe can begin to focus in on\n\n367\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.890\nthe idea of the crime and\nwhat may have happened as a result.\n\n368\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.060\nHopefully unravel that.\n\n369\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.660\nAnd so\nthis is really what he's famous for.\n\n370\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.660\nAnd just wanna make sure you're familiar\nwith it, wanna make sure you have a sense\n\n371\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.590\nof the history of the kind of things\nthat are behind our discussions.\n\n372\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.440\nI think it's always important or\nat least this is just my opinion, but\n\n373\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.680\nI think it's always important.\n\n374\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.990\nAs a person whose either\ninvolved as an investigator or\n\n375\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.990\na person who is involved in\nany kind of security capacity.\n\n376\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.870\nIn an IT capacity to understand the why\nof what we do, not just hey, yeah,\n\n377\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.760\nthere's this guy called Locard.\n\n378\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.770\nAnd he said something about leaving\nsomething and taking something and so\n\n379\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.970\nI just gotta remember that.\n\n380\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.200\nYeah, well, that's essentially\nprobably good enough, but\n\n381\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.430\nwhat I'm suggesting is that as an\ninvestigator, as a security professional.\n\n382\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.826\nIf we understand the why,\n\n383\n00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:52.261\nif we understand the root cause\nthat's behind the things we do.\n\n384\n00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:56.674\nWe're a lot more likely to be able\nto operate effectively, efficiently,\n\n385\n00:18:56.674 --> 00:19:00.650\nalso being more focused on\ndoing our job the right way.\n\n386\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.520\nAs a standing principle overall\nwithin information security,\n\n387\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.130\nwe talk about doing no harm, number one.\n\n388\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.990\nSo safety of life and acting honorably and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n389\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.990\nBut we really talk about due care and\ndue diligence as concepts.\n\n390\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.550\nAnd the idea of acting with\nthe appropriate amount of oversight,\n\n391\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.130\nthe appropriate amount of caution,\n\n392\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.600\nthe appropriate amount of care\nwith regards to everything we do.\n\n393\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.760\nAnd we get to that in our head\nmentally by understanding the why.\n\n394\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.010\nAnd so I think it's always important to\nlook at the historical background for\n\n395\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.980\nsome of this stuff.\n\n396\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.550\nUnderstand what the people that\ncame before us were doing,\n\n397\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.430\nwhat their thought process was.\n\n398\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.620\nHow did these guys sit\ndown at some point and\n\n399\n00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.550\nthink through the logic of all\nthe stuff that he was involved with.\n\n400\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.230\nAnd come up with this standing rule that\nover the time that it's been out there for\n\n401\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.140\n60, 70 years at this point,\nstill holds true today.\n\n402\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.770\nThe idea that criminals will\nalways leave something behind,\n\n403\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.810\nwe just have to figure out what it is.\n\n404\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.520\nThere's no such thing as the perfect\ncrime in other words, right?\n\n405\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.610\nAt some point,\n\n406\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.360\nsomebody is gonna make a mistake, we may\nnot be aware of what the mistake is.\n\n407\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.490\nWe may not have understood the signs\nwe saw when we examined the evidence.\n\n408\n00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.900\nWe may not have been able to understand\n\n409\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.640\nthe motivation that drove\nthis person to do this.\n\n410\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.580\nMeans that they would have done something\nalong these lines and we should look for\n\n411\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.080\nthis kind of information.\n\n412\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.050\nTo help find them,\nthat may not be apparent to us.\n\n413\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.500\nBut that doesn't mean it's not there,\nit just means we're not seeing-\n\n414\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.160\n&gt;&gt; It's so crazy in the way they'll show\n\n415\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.700\nthemselves, I remember seeing something\nabout a forensic investigation.\n\n416\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.110\nThey thought they had a suspect,\nthey were pretty sure it was them, but\n\n417\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.490\nthey couldn't prove it.\n\n418\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.590\nBut they got some fibers out of his\ncar and matched them with the body.\n\n419\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.840\nThey actually microscopically\nput them together and\n\n420\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.750\nproved that they were\nthe exact same type of fibers.\n\n421\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.360\nCame with this color, this shape and\nthey would fit together.\n\n422\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.725\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was insane.\n\n423\n00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:51.544\nThey could prove that was the same\nmanufacturer from the same car and\n\n424\n00:20:51.544 --> 00:20:55.970\nit was his car that that body had been\nin and therefore, they could arrest him.\n\n425\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.960\nInteresting.\n\n426\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.745\n&gt;&gt; And there you go, boys and girls.\n\n427\n00:20:58.745 --> 00:21:02.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, never, like you said,\nnever do you walk away from a crime or\n\n428\n00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:04.830\nwhatever and not leave some evidence.\n\n429\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.920\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's the kind of thing that's important.\n\n430\n00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.840\nJust wanted to stress that for you,\ngive you a sense of the history.\n\n431\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.770\nNot just because it's kind of\ninteresting to look back, right, and\n\n432\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.182\nyou learn a little bit about one of the\nseminal figures in investigative process.\n\n433\n00:21:18.182 --> 00:21:22.240\nAnd Locard was certainly one of those\npeople that really move this whole\n\n434\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.180\nidea forward.\n\n435\n00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.690\nAnd really contributed dramatically to\nour ability to understand how to do this\n\n436\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.745\nin a formal way.\n\n437\n00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:32.380\nBut it's perhaps the way to\ndescribe is kinda cool, right?\n\n438\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.830\nSo let's go back really\nunderstand where we come from\n\n439\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.830\nin terms of the kind of work\nthat we do everyday and\n\n440\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.540\nthe things that we look forward of doing\nas digital forensic investigators.\n\n441\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.180\nWhatever forensics may mean to you.\n\n442\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.240\nMay mean criminalistics,\nmay mean digital investigation.\n\n443\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.240\nWe're focused here with CHFI on\nthe digital component of forensics around\n\n444\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.080\ncomputers.\n\n445\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.790\nBut that doesn't mean we're not more\nbroadly aware of the ecosystem and\n\n446\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.130\nthe holistic vision of forensics overall.\n\n447\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.600\nSo we tried to broad that a little bit\nhere and there, talk about that with you.\n\n448\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.060\nBecause this is a subset of much broader\n\n449\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.100\nthough process around\ncriminalistic forensics overall.\n\n450\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.460\nAnd how we engage that at so many levels,\n\n451\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.640\nwhether it's you who said,\nyou'll be matching a fibers to a body.\n\n452\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.750\nThe chunk of a car from a police\ncriminalistic investigative perspective.\n\n453\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:21.090\nWhere its your DNA and fingerprints and\nblood samples and all the kind of stuff\n\n454\n00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.000\nwe talked about or have talked about at\nleast at a high level as I've showed you.\n\n455\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.960\nThe CSI website where all\nthe criminal handbooks were\n\n456\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.680\nin terms of forensics practices.\n\n457\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.830\nYou have things like tire patterns and\nshoe patterns and you have paints and\n\n458\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.718\nall that kind of stuff that they look at.\n\n459\n00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:38.330\nThere's all these interesting\nstuff that goes on\n\n460\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.360\nwith regards to this kind of a thing.\n\n461\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.200\nAnd so it's just a little bit\nof a historical perspective,\n\n462\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:43.960\nkind of interesting.\n\n463\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.460\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm guessing from Locard's perspective,\n\n464\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.890\nif an attacker breaks into a system,\nthey've done something.\n\n465\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.520\nThey've stolen information,\n\n466\n00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.300\nthey've left information maybe in the form\nof malware or something like that.\n\n467\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.070\nThey've left evidence.\n\n468\n00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.600\nThere's evidence of them\nhaving either remotely or\n\n469\n00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.740\nphysically been in that system,\nwe just got to find it.\n\n470\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.460\n&gt;&gt; In theory, I guess in\n\n471\n00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.280\npracticality it's good to say there's\nprobably no such thing as perfect crime.\n\n472\n00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.240\nIs there in theory\nsomething you could plan or\n\n473\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.500\nperhaps execute in tightly controlled\nconditions in a laboratory or wherever.\n\n474\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.600\nWhere you could create the perfect crime.\n\n475\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.285\nI'm not gonna say there isn't\nbecause I'm sure if I said that.\n\n476\n00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:24.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The minute I say that,\n\n477\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.720\nsomebody's figure out that there\nhas been somebody did that.\n\n478\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.780\nThey're gonna prove me wrong.\n\n479\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.280\nSo what I'm just suggesting when\nI said there's no such thing\n\n480\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.800\nas the perfect crime.\n\n481\n00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.140\nIs that on average the individuals\nthat execute these activities like you\n\n482\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.160\nwere suggesting,\n\n483\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.810\nsomebody breaks an old machine,\nthey're gonna leave behind something.\n\n484\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.750\nMaybe it's malware and\nmaybe it's also something else,\n\n485\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.810\nmaybe they do that on purpose to cover\ntheir tracks at least on theory.\n\n486\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.230\nThey think that's what 's gonna happen,\n\n487\n00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.335\nbut then they don't realize maybe we can\nfigure out stuff based on what they did.\n\n488\n00:23:52.335 --> 00:23:56.167\nThere's always something that something\nmay not be the difference between us\n\n489\n00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:57.916\nfiguring out what they did and not.\n\n490\n00:23:57.916 --> 00:24:01.021\nBecause as I suggested,\nwe may not have the knowledge and\n\n491\n00:24:01.021 --> 00:24:03.413\nthe perspective To be\nable to put the piece,\n\n492\n00:24:03.413 --> 00:24:08.120\nthat kind of that little piece of the clue\ninto the broader puzzle of what went on.\n\n493\n00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.360\nAnd with just that one piece,\nwe may not have enough evidence, but\n\n494\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.265\nthat doesn't mean that over time we're not\ngonna be able to work through it, as you\n\n495\n00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:19.205\nsuggested hey, it took them time, but they\nmatched fibers to the thing in the trunk.\n\n496\n00:24:19.205 --> 00:24:22.975\nAnd this with the body and\nI'm sure that didn't happen overnight.\n\n497\n00:24:22.975 --> 00:24:24.485\nBut at some point, right?\n\n498\n00:24:24.485 --> 00:24:26.115\nSomebody put together\nenough of that information.\n\n499\n00:24:26.115 --> 00:24:29.610\nThat example you shared with us Daniel,\nto make it clear.\n\n500\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.440\nRight that they in theory\nhave the right person.\n\n501\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.657\nOr may didn't have the right person and\nwent out and found the right person.\n\n502\n00:24:34.657 --> 00:24:39.394\nSo there is always the opportunity for us\nto see that something was left behind but\n\n503\n00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:42.510\nwe have to be attuned to\nthe idea that it's there.\n\n504\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.560\nAnd we have to be sensitive to the fact\nthat it's something we have to look for.\n\n505\n00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.850\nIt's not always just gonna\nbe laying on the surface,\n\n506\n00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.540\nnot always obvious that it's malware\nas you suggested, whatever it may be.\n\n507\n00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.460\nMalware’s probably gonna be\nsomething that stands out, right?\n\n508\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.940\nIt’s probably for the most part something\nthat we’ll find fairly quickly in a system\n\n509\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.430\nthat we’re investigating, especially one\nthat we’ve quarantined, we’ve taken to\n\n510\n00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:10.480\na lab and we’re statically and dynamically\nanalyzing, to understand what’s there.\n\n511\n00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.220\nWe’ll come across that fairly quickly\nI would think, even if it’s something\n\n512\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.620\ninsidious like a rootkit that’s buried\nsomewhere, we’ll figure that out.\n\n513\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.140\nBut if something more subtle, it may be\nhard, maybe they modified as we suggested\n\n514\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.250\nthe naming convention or the extension\non files maybe they buried files\n\n515\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.460\ninside that system with key loggers\nthat could then be pulled out, so\n\n516\n00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.560\nthey could understand,\nthey being the bad actor.\n\n517\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.350\nSo they could understand passwords and\nuser names, stuffs like that and\n\n518\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.580\nwhile we may have evidence\ngathered in that hard drive.\n\n519\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.010\nWe may have those files.\n\n520\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.080\nIf we don't know which of the 2,000\ntext files buried in the system\n\n521\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.680\nhappen to contain that information,\nit may take us a while to go through and\n\n522\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.830\nfigure out what's there.\n\n523\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.610\nSo it may not be as simple as saying,\nyeah look.\n\n524\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.380\nWe found five files that don't appear\nbelong there because we ran a malware\n\n525\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.440\nscan and we found these five\nfiles that look like malware.\n\n526\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.130\nWe may have malware that is\nconstantly changing itself.\n\n527\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.840\nPolyinstantiation and\npolymorphic code that can modify\n\n528\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.581\nitself every time it executes and\nessentially it's virus A today, tomorrow\n\n529\n00:26:18.581 --> 00:26:23.230\nmorning when it executes becomes virus\na plus something else or not even virus A.\n\n530\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.620\nIt will be virus Z because\nit totally morphs and\n\n531\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.425\nchanges it's entire code structure.\n\n532\n00:26:29.425 --> 00:26:32.710\nThese kinds of viruses\nexist in the wild today and\n\n533\n00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.020\nthey're incredibly problematic to deal\nwith because every time they execute,\n\n534\n00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.660\nthere's a brand new signature if you will\nfor the virus right for the malware.\n\n535\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.180\nAnd traditional malware definition\n\n536\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.470\nbased scanners can not find this stuff\nbecause we don't know what to look for.\n\n537\n00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.060\nWe know a minute ago it was this,\nbut now it's something different.\n\n538\n00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.620\nThere's no signature for that.\n\n539\n00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.620\nWe don't understand\nthe hopping pattern and\n\n540\n00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.250\nthe morphing pattern,\nthere's no way for us to keep up.\n\n541\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.220\nNow there are scanners that can find this,\nwe use heuristics and\n\n542\n00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.180\nAI, artificial intelligence and\nwe use a bunch of\n\n543\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.720\ndifferent approaches to be able to\nfigure out how these viruses behave.\n\n544\n00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.950\nThere are tale tell signs of viruses\nleft behind that we can follow.\n\n545\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.130\nThere are certain files that don't morph.\n\n546\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.060\nThere are certain not only file types but\n\n547\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.640\nalso pieces of information that the virus\nkind of leaves behind almost like DNA,\n\n548\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.660\nthat is left in the system\nthat we can then latch on to.\n\n549\n00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.302\nSo there are ways to find this stuff,\nbut it would be really really difficult.\n\n550\n00:27:31.302 --> 00:27:33.290\nAnd we may not figure out for some time.\n\n551\n00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.190\nAnd if the investigator\nis not knowledgeable\n\n552\n00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.660\nenough to know this is what they're\ndealing with because maybe viruses and\n\n553\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.536\nmalware are not their thing,\nit's just not what they're specialize in.\n\n554\n00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:45.890\nThey may not know and they may not\nrealize what they have to look for.\n\n555\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.820\nIt goes back to that idea of\nbuilding the forensics team and\n\n556\n00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.710\nhaving the toolkit not just\nthe physical tools but\n\n557\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.670\nthe people involved in the processes that\nyou can rely on and to partner with.\n\n558\n00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.760\nThat's also gonna be very important for\nus to think about.\n\n559\n00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.420\nSo there's a lot going on there.\n\n560\n00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.340\nIt's a pretty rich conversation with\nregards to how we figure it out or\n\n561\n00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.410\nwhat that information may look like.\n\n562\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.690\nThere are types of digital data.\n\n563\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.496\nAnd we've talked about this before.\n\n564\n00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:12.780\nWe've talked about the types of data,\nwhere data comes from, what it may be, but\n\n565\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.270\nthere's types of digital data\nthat we wanna think about.\n\n566\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.400\nWe have volatile, transient or fragile\ndata that referred to different ways, but\n\n567\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:25.250\nessentially volatile data is data that's\nin memory spaces In caches, in registers.\n\n568\n00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.730\nIt's the kind of data that disappears\nwhen the system is turned off.\n\n569\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.030\nAnd if we don't capture that, we're gonna\nlose access to that data permanently.\n\n570\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.020\nYou can't reproduce that,\nit's not gonna be on the hard drive.\n\n571\n00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.745\nIt's just essentially gone.\n\n572\n00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:40.495\nSo we talk about data in terms\nof digital types of data.\n\n573\n00:28:40.495 --> 00:28:43.885\nThe volatile data's usually the most\ncritical we look to capture.\n\n574\n00:28:43.885 --> 00:28:47.455\nThere's non-volatile,\ndata that's essentially static,\n\n575\n00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:52.032\nthat will stay on the hard drive or in\na system in some way, wherever storage is.\n\n576\n00:28:52.032 --> 00:28:53.342\nAnd we'll be able to get to that.\n\n577\n00:28:53.342 --> 00:28:57.362\nThat Word document that I modified,\nthat I added the metadata attribute to and\n\n578\n00:28:57.362 --> 00:29:00.272\nI put Daniel on as an author,\nthat's on the hard drive.\n\n579\n00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:02.090\nI turned the machine off, turn it back on.\n\n580\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.840\nThat document's still gonna be there.\n\n581\n00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.830\nIt's not gonna disappear.\n\n582\n00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:09.650\nAnd then residual remnant data, data\nthat's left behind after we delete data,\n\n583\n00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.510\nquote unquote right, delete data.\n\n584\n00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.920\nWe did the demonstration for you with\nthe recover file tool where we went in and\n\n585\n00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.620\nwe took a look at the fact that although\nI had deleted files off the system.\n\n586\n00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.750\nWe're able to see them still there, able\nto look at them, recover them if needed.\n\n587\n00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.070\nSo, there's different\ntypes of digital data.\n\n588\n00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:30.190\nWant to, as an investigator, be aware\nof this because we have to understand\n\n589\n00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.870\nthis kinds, or rather these kinds, these\ncategories of data have to be, in our\n\n590\n00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.310\nmind, the thing that we go after but\nwe have to go after them in a certain way.\n\n591\n00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.010\nRight, because if we don't go\nafter volatile data first and\n\n592\n00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.037\nwe loose the continuity of the system,\nsystem gets turned off.\n\n593\n00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:46.968\nWe've lost access to the data, it's gone.\n\n594\n00:29:46.968 --> 00:29:49.900\nIt's never gonna be coming back,\nit's what we call femoral data.\n\n595\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.143\nIt's disappearing, and\n\n596\n00:29:51.143 --> 00:29:55.620\nthere may be critical Information\nto our investigation sitting inside\n\n597\n00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.320\nof that data set that we're never gonna be\nable to get access to if it disappears.\n\n598\n00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.640\n&gt;&gt; Adam, bad actors knowing that this\ndata is so or can be destroyed or\n\n599\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.860\nmanipulated, in a way that wouldn't be\nable to be use, do they go into maybe\n\n600\n00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:14.160\nan attack knowing that and doing things\nactively so that the data that would\n\n601\n00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.550\nbe used of it as a evidence would be then\ntherefore not be able to use should I say.\n\n602\n00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.260\nSure.\n&gt;&gt; It's a great question, so\n\n603\n00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.760\nlet me share with you not only an example,\nbut a real world story so to speak.\n\n604\n00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.750\nSo we do a lot of different\nthings here at ITProTV.\n\n605\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:33.420\nWe did a whole series on certified ethical\nhacking, right and interesting stuff,\n\n606\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.620\nencourage you in a couple different\nplaces in our discussions in CHFI\n\n607\n00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.090\ntake a look at some of that material as\nbackground for kind of the knowledge and\n\n608\n00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.660\nthe stuff we're talking about here.\n\n609\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.850\nSo let me reference some of\nthe material from CEH and\n\n610\n00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.010\nthe concepts of hacking to answer Daniel's\nquestion, it's a really interesting one.\n\n611\n00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.750\nSo one of the things we talk\nabout a lot in hacking and\n\n612\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.757\nI teach a lot of my students\nwhen I do hacking work.\n\n613\n00:30:54.757 --> 00:30:58.270\nAnd I talk to customers about when\nI do investigative and audit work,\n\n614\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.660\nis the scenario that goes\nsomething like this, right.\n\n615\n00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.030\nTo essentially speak to Daniel's question.\n\n616\n00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.200\nSo, as a bad actor,\nI wanna break in to your system, right?\n\n617\n00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.030\nCome into a computer somewhere\nnear you very soon, right?\n\n618\n00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.320\nSo I wanna get into your system.\n\n619\n00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.250\nSo one of the things I\nmaybe able to do thinking\n\n620\n00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.530\nlike Daniel is asking me to think\nas a bad actor is to follow it.\n\n621\n00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.620\nI wanna get in but\nI wanna essentially be a ninja.\n\n622\n00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.910\nI don't wanna be found,\nI wanna be a ghost.\n\n623\n00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.890\nThat's the goal.\n\n624\n00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.020\nThe great hackers,\n\n625\n00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.010\nhackers that know what to do and\nhow to do it, you never hear about them.\n\n626\n00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.810\nYou never find out about them,\nyou never see them.\n\n627\n00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.560\nThey're not the ones that make\nheadlines and wind up on the news.\n\n628\n00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.150\nThey're the people that just go about\ntheir work everyday and are just literally\n\n629\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.070\nghosts, they just walk through the world\nand nobody knows they're there.\n\n630\n00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.330\n&gt;&gt; The delta force of hacking.\n\n631\n00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.550\n&gt;&gt; There are such people and\nthere is such a thing.\n\n632\n00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.470\nI promise you there are, right?\n\n633\n00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.820\nAnd so as a result people like this\nwith skills we call them mad skills,\n\n634\n00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.599\nmad hacker skills, right?\n\n635\n00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:54.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n636\n00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.445\n&gt;&gt; They're hacking Kung Fu\nis strong as we would say.\n\n637\n00:31:56.445 --> 00:31:59.957\nSo these people Understand\nhow to manipulate and\n\n638\n00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:03.900\nhow to use these kinds of\nrules to their advantage.\n\n639\n00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.880\nAnd so we talked about reading RFCs in one\nof our earlier episodes and looking at\n\n640\n00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.560\nthe owner's manual for a protocol like TCP\nto understand more about how it works.\n\n641\n00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.738\nAnd by manipulating that knowledge,\nbeing better at being able to get in and\n\n642\n00:32:16.738 --> 00:32:19.755\nmodify data, and\nalso being good as an investigator.\n\n643\n00:32:19.755 --> 00:32:22.690\nSo what if a scenario like\nthe following was to occur?\n\n644\n00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.610\nLet's say I wanted to\nbreak into your system but\n\n645\n00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.340\nI had to come through a border gateway\nof some kind, let's call it a router.\n\n646\n00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.472\nAnd I had to come in through the router,\nand I had to then gain\n\n647\n00:32:31.472 --> 00:32:35.500\naccess through the router to internal\nsystems to do whatever I was gonna do.\n\n648\n00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.853\nAnd then obviously on my way out, I go out\nessentially the same way I came in, right?\n\n649\n00:32:39.853 --> 00:32:42.436\nLogic dictates that I would\nleave evidence at the router,\n\n650\n00:32:42.436 --> 00:32:44.500\nbecause I would have\ngone through the router.\n\n651\n00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.570\nThere would be evidence of me\nmoving through the device.\n\n652\n00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.430\nYour logging, most likely.\n\n653\n00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.383\nProbably capture my IP address.\n\n654\n00:32:52.383 --> 00:32:56.630\nYou'll probably capture information\nabout my inbound destination.\n\n655\n00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:01.227\nYou would be able to, if you were using\nRadius or Triple A, you would be able to,\n\n656\n00:33:01.227 --> 00:33:04.830\nyou know, look at information\nabout my entire session.\n\n657\n00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.619\nYou would be able to figure out\nwhere I went and what I did, and\n\n658\n00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:09.919\nthen building on that from\nlogs in other systems,\n\n659\n00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:13.623\nprobably you'll complete some sort of\na trace and build a picture of what I did.\n\n660\n00:33:13.623 --> 00:33:16.907\nSo knowing that, if I am a hacker and\nI'm looking to do harm but\n\n661\n00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:20.256\nlooking either to leave purposely\nan erroneous trail behind,\n\n662\n00:33:20.256 --> 00:33:24.552\nwhich is one potential answer to your\nquestion, and/or leave behind no trail or\n\n663\n00:33:24.552 --> 00:33:27.836\nminimal at best of a trail,\nI would go through the router, but\n\n664\n00:33:27.836 --> 00:33:31.627\nI would use special tools that would\nallow me to either tunnel through or\n\n665\n00:33:31.627 --> 00:33:33.470\nbreak through the router.\n\n666\n00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:38.200\nAnd as a result of that,\nif I can get access to the router, and\n\n667\n00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.090\nknowing a little bit about routers\nas Daniel does, I know, and\n\n668\n00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.430\nas hopefully a lot of you do, you know\nthat there are different levels of\n\n669\n00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.790\npermission you're assigned as\na user in a router, potentially.\n\n670\n00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:52.311\nThere's essentially a root level account\nthat gives you full rights to configure\n\n671\n00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:56.437\nthe router, to modify configurations,\nto essentially run the router and\n\n672\n00:33:56.437 --> 00:33:57.499\ninteract with it.\n\n673\n00:33:57.499 --> 00:34:01.261\nAnd then there's a lower level account or\ntwo that are typically created,\n\n674\n00:34:01.261 --> 00:34:03.889\nthat are useful for\njust doing some basic stuff, and\n\n675\n00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:07.480\nnot being able to modify configurations,\nthings like that.\n\n676\n00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.830\nIf we're good, if we understand that, if\nthe person who programmed the router was\n\n677\n00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.880\nnot too smart and we're able to figure\nout the password for the account that can\n\n678\n00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.220\ncontrol the router, we can do what's\ncalled modifying the configuration.\n\n679\n00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.370\nThere's two configurations in a router.\n\n680\n00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.701\nThere's the stored config, the one that's\nloaded into memory that is essentially\n\n681\n00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:29.249\nused as the pristine copy to boot\nthe router or to restart the router.\n\n682\n00:34:29.249 --> 00:34:32.307\nEvery time you restart the router\nyou load a copy of this config and\n\n683\n00:34:32.307 --> 00:34:36.325\nyou leave the original intact, and that\nbecomes what's called the running config.\n\n684\n00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:38.800\nAnd you essentially run\noff that configuration.\n\n685\n00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.660\nThat way we always have a good clean\ncopy and we don't screw anything up.\n\n686\n00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.990\nIf we modify with the appropriate account,\n\n687\n00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.740\nthe running config of that router, we can\nchange the way it behaves in real time\n\n688\n00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.230\nwithout messing up\nthe stored configuration.\n\n689\n00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.577\nSo if you see where I'm going with this,\nright, the logic would be,\n\n690\n00:34:54.577 --> 00:34:58.101\nthat with appropriate level of access and\nappropriate knowledge I could\n\n691\n00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:02.283\nreprogram that router, changing the way\nit behaves, changing the way it operates.\n\n692\n00:35:02.283 --> 00:35:05.287\nI could then go about\nmy nefarious business.\n\n693\n00:35:05.287 --> 00:35:08.990\nI could avoid, probably, other landmines\nyou may have put out elsewhere.\n\n694\n00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.377\nI could maybe even get into your\nSEM system and modify logs so\n\n695\n00:35:12.377 --> 00:35:17.300\nthat I could make it look like I did\ncertain things, or didn't do other things.\n\n696\n00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.030\nI may or may not go to this length,\nit obviously depends on what I'm doing.\n\n697\n00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.689\nBut let's just focus on the router.\n\n698\n00:35:21.689 --> 00:35:23.257\nSo I'm coming back out now.\n\n699\n00:35:23.257 --> 00:35:26.159\nSo on my way out, I've now got\na configuration that's modified\n\n700\n00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:29.399\nthat's gonna stand out like a sore\nthumb when somebody investigates.\n\n701\n00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:30.460\nSo what do I do?\n\n702\n00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.540\nWell, if I restart the router\non my way out, what happens?\n\n703\n00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.005\nThe running config and memory gets wiped.\n\n704\n00:35:36.005 --> 00:35:39.020\nIt gets reloaded with the store\nconfig when you restart the system.\n\n705\n00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.518\nStore config has not been touched and\nas a result,\n\n706\n00:35:42.518 --> 00:35:44.439\nthe configuration goes back to normal.\n\n707\n00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:46.750\nNow, there will be evidence of this,\nright?\n\n708\n00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.142\nThere are logs that are kept.\n\n709\n00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:51.251\nThere will be evidence of the fact\nthat the power cycling on the device\n\n710\n00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:52.140\ntook place.\n\n711\n00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.010\nSo if I know that, and I know that you're\nlogging this stuff somewhere, I can go and\n\n712\n00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.620\nI can modify that information or\n\n713\n00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.450\nI could upload a fake set of logs\nthat I've crafted ahead of time, and\n\n714\n00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.640\nI may be able to then cover evidence,\nand cover tracks for what I did.\n\n715\n00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.954\nSo, there's all these different ways\nthat we can manipulate the environmental\n\n716\n00:36:07.954 --> 00:36:09.425\nvariables in a scenario like that.\n\n717\n00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:11.150\nBut, one kind of thought process.\n\n718\n00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.400\nOne, let's say, just generic idea that\ncould be used in a variety of different\n\n719\n00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.930\nways, having information about how\ndevices work would allow me as a hacker\n\n720\n00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.470\nto take advantage of that,\nbut also as an investigator,\n\n721\n00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.860\nto focus in on some tell-tale signs\nthat may tell me that somebody did that.\n\n722\n00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.840\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n723\n00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.000\nWell, Alan, there's a lot for\n\n724\n00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.230\nus to take in when it comes to\nthe handling of digital evidence.\n\n725\n00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.665\nIt's not just a piece of paper laying on\na desk, we have to treat it a certain way\n\n726\n00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:39.839\nwith a certain type of mindset\nbecause it is different.\n\n727\n00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:43.637\nIt's its own thing, and we have a certain\nmethodology that we need to take in place\n\n728\n00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:46.737\nand considerations to, well,\nconsider when working with that.\n\n729\n00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Considerations to consider.\n&gt;&gt; You like that?\n\n730\n00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.067\nI like being redundant\nfirst thing in the morning.\n\n731\n00:36:49.067 --> 00:36:51.711\n&gt;&gt; Things to do and places to go.\n\n732\n00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:53.146\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, that being said,\n\n733\n00:36:53.146 --> 00:36:54.595\nI know we got more when it\ncomes to Digital Evidence.\n\n734\n00:36:54.595 --> 00:36:55.350\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n735\n00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.400\n&gt;&gt; But we're well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n736\n00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.103\nHopefully you'll join us in\na part two on Digital Evidence.\n\n737\n00:37:00.103 --> 00:37:02.016\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n738\n00:37:02.016 --> 00:37:05.150\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n739\n00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm the co-host,\nDigital Evidence number eight.\n\n740\n00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.171\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n741\n00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:12.697\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n742\n00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:18.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n743\n00:37:18.363 --> 00:37:22.110\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:13.935\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.480\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.175\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:21.513\nin today's episode it's continuing\non with our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:25.671\nAnd joining us in the studio yet again to\nlend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n9\n00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.380\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.940\nAdam, welcome back and glad to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello.\n\n12\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n13\n00:00:30.670 -->

00:00:36.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just like saying hello,\n\n17\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.580\nit's actually just what it is.\n\n18\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.615\nWe should put an echo around that.\n\n19\n00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:42.011\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Do a little Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\n20\n00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.090\nHello!\n\n21\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.626\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n22\n00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.900\nwe're going to continue talking a little\nbit more about digital evidence.\n\n23\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.010\nWe were chatting in the last\nconversation just at a high level about\n\n24\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.730\nsome of the things to be aware of.\n\n25\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.080\nWhat kind of evidence is digital evidence,\nwhere does it come from,\n\n26\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.120\nsome things about what we may or\nmay not know about it.\n\n27\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.220\nThe concerns we have about digital\nevidence in terms of volatility and\n\n28\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.480\nthings of that nature.\n\n29\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.220\nOne of the things that's actually\nbecome interesting is the rise of what\n\n30\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.870\nwe call anti-digital forensics behavior.\n\n31\n00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.934\nI explained this a little bit,\nalthough I didn't call it this,\n\n32\n00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:18.625\nat the very end of the last discussion\nwhen I was actually answering Daniel's\n\n33\n00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:22.469\nscenario question about hey, what would\nhappen if a bad actor did this or that?\n\n34\n00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.915\nAnd I explained a little bit about how we\nmay be able to manipulate a router and\n\n35\n00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:29.208\nmess around with the running config and\n\n36\n00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:34.025\nmodify it in such a way that it allows us\nto do things that we wouldn't normally do.\n\n37\n00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.500\nThe idea of the fragility of data,\ndata being so fragile and\n\n38\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.100\nvolatile, leads us to think about this\nconcept of anti-digital forensics.\n\n39\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.730\nThe ability for bad actors to essentially\ntake advantage of the knowledge\n\n40\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.100\nthat certain kinds of\ndata can be manipulated,\n\n41\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.660\nit's perishable, it may have\nproperties that are transitory.\n\n42\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.990\nAnd as a result,\nif it's manipulated, we may or\n\n43\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.320\nmay not be able to tell\nthat it was modified.\n\n44\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.400\nAnd they seek to take advantage of this by\nexecuting behaviors that allow them to,\n\n45\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.250\nin some way, manipulate or\nmodify the data.\n\n46\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.700\nSo things like counter forensics tools\nthat may allow for manipulation,\n\n47\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.733\nmodification, obfuscation,\nerasure are used in this anti-digital\n\n48\n00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:19.780\nforensics thought process to\nthe advantage of the bad actor and\n\n49\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.710\nunfortunately to the detriment of us,\nthe investigator.\n\n50\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.080\nSo this concept of anti-digital\nforensics is just something for\n\n51\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.030\nyou to be aware of and\nsomething to think about.\n\n52\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.480\nIt is something that we don't formally\nsay look, there's somebody up to no good,\n\n53\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.870\nthey're using an ADF, an anti-digital\nforensics tool necessarily, but\n\n54\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.550\nit is something that is a mindset we\ndo want to be aware of and think about.\n\n55\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.090\nSo, just something to consider.\n\n56\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.270\nWe've talked about the rules of evidence\nbefore and the need to follow them.\n\n57\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.787\nKeeping in mind, that we're talking\nabout the United States federal rules of\n\n58\n00:02:49.787 --> 00:02:52.253\nevidence, primarily in our\nconversations with you.\n\n59\n00:02:52.253 --> 00:02:56.139\nI keep reminding you, and strongly\nencouraging you to think about what those\n\n60\n00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.631\nlook like in your world, in the country\nthat you may be operating in.\n\n61\n00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:03.361\nIf you're not in the United States,\nand not doing things in the US,\n\n62\n00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:07.877\nthere will be the equivalent set of rules,\nor the equivalent set of laws governing\n\n63\n00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:11.542\nevidence and governing the conduct\nthat a digital investigator or\n\n64\n00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.660\nforensic examiner has to follow.\n\n65\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.400\nAnd you want to be aware of those,\nand understand what they are.\n\n66\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.590\nWe talk about the best evidence rule,\nboth here in the US and\n\n67\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.270\nin many areas around the world.\n\n68\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.760\nThe idea that the court only allows\ncertain kinds of evidence in.\n\n69\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.950\nWe've spoken about the hear-say rule,\nand the exceptions to it before.\n\n70\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.820\nAnd we wanna understand this\nconcept of best evidence.\n\n71\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.260\nSo if we only allow original evidence to\nbe presented, then we have to think about\n\n72\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.560\nwhat that means for\nus as examiners, as investigators.\n\n73\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.120\nThe only original evidence that we\nallow would be things like, for\n\n74\n00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.370\ninstance a document, we were talking about\ndocuments sitting on the desktop before.\n\n75\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.960\nAnd the idea will be that if we\nhave that original document,\n\n76\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.300\nwe can present it as evidence.\n\n77\n00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.570\nBut what about a copy?\n\n78\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.740\nWhat if Daniel takes\nthat original document,\n\n79\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.770\nmakes a copy of it, either by\nprinting it or by photographing it or\n\n80\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.840\ndoing something and hands it back to me\nand says, okay Adam here is your document.\n\n81\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.550\nBut it's a copy, it's not the original,\nI may struggle to present that at court\n\n82\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.800\nbecause it may not be seen as being\nlegitimate and original evidence.\n\n83\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.060\nIt may have been modified,\nwe may not be able to tell for\n\n84\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.080\nsure that it is the original,\nthese are things to consider.\n\n85\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.880\nSo things like documents, photographs,\n\n86\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.770\nrecordings have to be original as\nopposed to copies to be presented.\n\n87\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.240\nBut a duplicate of that evidence can\nbe presented, in other words a copy can\n\n88\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.020\npotentially be used but only under\ncertain stringent circumstances.\n\n89\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.020\nWe've talked about the need\nto forensically capture and\n\n90\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.250\nsoundly work with using the proper\nrules of forensics investigation.\n\n91\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.230\nData and making a copy of that data using\na hash to signify that it's the same as\n\n92\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.640\nthe original, would then allow\nus to present the copy at trial,\n\n93\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.980\nas opposed to the original evidence.\n\n94\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.420\nSo it's something to think about.\n\n95\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.870\nOriginal evidence, if it's been\ndestroyed due to fire or flood,\n\n96\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.320\na copy may be allowed to be replaced or\nto be substituted for it at trial.\n\n97\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.510\nEvidence that's destroyed during\nthe normal course of business,\n\n98\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.520\nnormal being a relative thing,\nit has to be interpreted by the court,\n\n99\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.130\nwould be then grounds potentially\nto introduce a copy of that,\n\n100\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.840\nif we could certify the copy\nas being legitimate.\n\n101\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.174\nOriginal evidence in the possession\nof a third-party would also\n\n102\n00:05:16.174 --> 00:05:19.386\npotentially then allow us to\nproduce a copy of that evidence and\n\n103\n00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:22.557\nsubmit it at trial under certain\ncontrolled circumstances.\n\n104\n00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:26.577\nAgain, it will be up to the court,\nmeaning, usually when we say that,\n\n105\n00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:30.129\nwe mean up to the judge, right,\nin the court who is presiding,\n\n106\n00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.568\nto be able to figure out whether or\nnot they will accept that.\n\n107\n00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:37.560\nAnd under those conditions, say, yeah,\nthat evidence is good, we'll take a copy\n\n108\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.140\nof that because the original is not\nattainable for whatever reason.\n\n109\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.970\nSo we wanna understand the concept of the\nbest evidence rule, it is important for\n\n110\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.375\nus to think about, it is important for\nus to ensure we understand,\n\n111\n00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.590\nas investigators,\nwhen we may have to produce a copy but\n\n112\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.320\nalso when legitimately we may or\nmay not be able to.\n\n113\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.240\nAnd so that's something to think about.\n\n114\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.790\nA lot of times in these crime dramas\nthat we refer to every so often in our\n\n115\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.110\ndiscussions, you'll see that they'll,\none of the lawyers will hold something up.\n\n116\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.100\nLook, this is people's exhibit five and\nthey have a piece of paper in a bag or\n\n117\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.640\nwhatever, they ask someone\nto take a look at it.\n\n118\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.610\nA lot of times, that stuff is in theory,\nat least in the context of\n\n119\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.990\nthe conversation on the TV show is\npurported to be original evidence, right?\n\n120\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.385\nBut we don't know for\nsure that it is, it could be a copy.\n\n121\n00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:27.580\nSo a lot of times, they'll say,\nhey, this is a copy of the log,\n\n122\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.910\nthe sign in log from such and\nsuch and can you please read that.\n\n123\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.780\nWhen they say it's a copy,\nwhat they've done is they've for\n\n124\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.580\nwhatever reason I've been\nable to get the original but\n\n125\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.170\nthey have essentially a certified copy\nthat's being introduced under the best\n\n126\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.330\nevidence rule and it's being certified\nby the court as being acceptable.\n\n127\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.020\nSo this is kinda how we see that\nhappening and what we see going on.\n\n128\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.170\nThere is some examples we would look\nto in the federal rules of evidence\n\n129\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.160\nto deal with some of the staff.\n\n130\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.070\nWe talked about the hearsay\nexceptions already and\n\n131\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.580\nwe've been through those a little bit.\n\n132\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.954\nBut I wanna just call your\nattention to one aspect of them.\n\n133\n00:06:57.954 --> 00:07:00.367\nThe hearsay exceptions are rule 803.\n\n134\n00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:02.056\nIf you remember from the prior episode,\n\n135\n00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.240\nwe took a look at the federal\nrules of evidence.\n\n136\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.250\nWe talked about the different\nnumbers associated with them,\n\n137\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.190\nthere's all these different areas.\n\n138\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.889\nAnd we saw like rule number eight dealt\nwith the item that was number eight in\n\n139\n00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.781\nterms of the overall set of items and then\nsubset, 801, 02, 03 etc., were the rules\n\n140\n00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:24.431\nunderneath that for that particular\nchapter or that particular clause.\n\n141\n00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:29.899\nSo the heresay rules and the exceptions\nare found in rules 8, 801, 802, 803.\n\n142\n00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:34.692\n803 the hearsay exceptions availability of\ndeclarant material, meaning somebody or\n\n143\n00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:39.105\nfor some reason, whoever has made the\nstatement the decelerate to somebody who's\n\n144\n00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:43.664\nmade a statement that's gonna be submitted\nas an evidence is available as a witness.\n\n145\n00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:47.848\nSo if you are available as a witness,\nthere are certain things we will or\n\n146\n00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:48.913\nwon't allow in.\n\n147\n00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:52.195\nAnd if you're not available as a witness,\nthere are certain things we will or\n\n148\n00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:53.010\nwill not allow in.\n\n149\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.721\nSo let's say, in theory, Daniel's told me\nsomething and I make a note of that and\n\n150\n00:07:57.721 --> 00:08:02.023\nwe offer that in evidence and the judge\nsays okay is Daniel around can we call\n\n151\n00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.375\nhim in and can he testify to what he said?\n\n152\n00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.107\nAnd I say, yeah,\nabsolutely, we can get him.\n\n153\n00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:09.135\nAnd he comes in and\nhe sits and he's deposed and\n\n154\n00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:12.230\neverybody understands what he said.\n\n155\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.500\nThere are certain ways we handle evidence\nwhen the person that made the statement\n\n156\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.260\nis around.\n\n157\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.910\nIf Daniel's not available for\nwhatever reason, we may not be able to\n\n158\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.150\nintroduce certain evidence that he may or\nmay not have given us.\n\n159\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.870\nBecause he's not around to verify\nthat that evidence is accurate.\n\n160\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.120\nSo we want to understand that rule 803,\n\n161\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.410\nhearsay exceptions when\nthe declarant is available.\n\n162\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.910\nRule 804, hearsay exceptions when\nthe declarant is unavailable.\n\n163\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:41.190\nAnd there's all this, essentially\njust minutiae that as investigators,\n\n164\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.850\nwe need to go through and be aware of.\n\n165\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.942\nBecause we have to understand that the\nrules change based on the circumstances\n\n166\n00:08:46.942 --> 00:08:47.565\ninvolved.\n\n167\n00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:51.988\nSo for instance, one example, if\nthe declarant is available as a witness,\n\n168\n00:08:51.988 --> 00:08:55.510\nthe following may not be\nexcluded by the hearsay rule.\n\n169\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.686\nExcited utterances cannot be excluded,\nmeaning that if the declarant is available\n\n170\n00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:02.153\nand in the heat of the moment\nthey said something,\n\n171\n00:09:02.153 --> 00:09:06.116\nwe could admit that into evidence if\nthey're around to be questioned about it.\n\n172\n00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:10.274\nEven though normally, an excited utterance\nmay not be allowed if they're not\n\n173\n00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:13.050\navailable as a witness,\nso it would depend.\n\n174\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.240\nA recorded recollection, Daniel writes\nsomething down in a journal and\n\n175\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.520\nwe call him to testify about that a year\nand a half later, we can allow that.\n\n176\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.330\nIt's not considered heresy.\n\n177\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.025\nWe can allow that because\nDaniel's around as a witness and\n\n178\n00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:30.565\ncould be speaking to the impressions and\nthings he wrote in the journal.\n\n179\n00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:35.225\nWhereas if he was not around as a witness,\nwe may not allow a recorded impression.\n\n180\n00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:38.265\nPublic records and reports are allowed.\n\n181\n00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:40.255\nRecords of regularly conducted activities.\n\n182\n00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:43.895\nSo, logs, for instance,\nor things of that nature.\n\n183\n00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:45.525\nGuestbooks where you sign in.\n\n184\n00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:49.561\nThat stuff is allowed under the hearsay\nexception if the witness that\n\n185\n00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:53.121\nis going to speak to them is around and\navailable to testify.\n\n186\n00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:55.719\nBut they would not be normally\nif the witness is not.\n\n187\n00:09:55.719 --> 00:10:00.543\nSome exceptions under rule 804 where\nthe declarant is not available.\n\n188\n00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:04.511\nSo if the declarant is unavailable as\na witness, the following items and\n\n189\n00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:06.990\nthings are not excluded\nby the hearsay rule.\n\n190\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.808\nIf they've already offered\ntestimony in a prior trial or\n\n191\n00:10:10.808 --> 00:10:12.259\nin another venue in some way.\n\n192\n00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:16.250\nMaybe in a deposition or whatever\nwould've been leading up to the trial.\n\n193\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.970\nWhere the testimony is considered\nlegitimate, it's properly gathered.\n\n194\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.520\nWe will admit that testimony\neven though they're not around\n\n195\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.250\nto be able to be cross-examined on it.\n\n196\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.850\nSo former testimony will be admitted\nif you're not available as a witness.\n\n197\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.330\nStatement under belief of impending death.\n\n198\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.483\nSo if somebody believes they're about\nto die and makes a utterance or\n\n199\n00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:36.284\na statement because of that.\n\n200\n00:10:36.284 --> 00:10:40.321\nEven if they have passed away and\nwe can no longer cross-examine them,\n\n201\n00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:45.020\nwe will accept that statement because\nthey are not available as a witness.\n\n202\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.530\nSo statement against interest,\nstatement of personal or family history.\n\n203\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.100\nThese are categories that are not gonna\nbe excluded under the hearsay rule if\n\n204\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.710\nthe witness is no longer available.\n\n205\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.340\nYou see this sometimes on the TV\nshows where somebody's died and\n\n206\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.680\nthey have a dying utterance or\nthey left behind a note or something.\n\n207\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.990\nAnd they're trying to\nget that into evidence.\n\n208\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.995\nAnd the judge will often rule on it and\nsay,\n\n209\n00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:07.959\nokay, exception to the hearsay clause.\n\n210\n00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:11.560\nBut because the person is no longer alive,\nI'm going to allow it.\n\n211\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.720\nAnd former testimony is\noften allowed as well.\n\n212\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.840\nSo you want to be aware\nof that kind of stuff.\n\n213\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.190\nAnother interesting one, content of\nwritings, recordings and photographs.\n\n214\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.778\nSo this is Rule 1001 and\nhow these things are defined.\n\n215\n00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:29.130\nBecause again, this comes down to\nthe very specific, very regimental,\n\n216\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.960\nvery rigid interpretation\nof what is in the law.\n\n217\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.810\nAnd if something is not defined,\nthen It may not be available to us and\n\n218\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.790\nwe may not be able to work with it,\nso writings and recordings.\n\n219\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.620\nAnd we say that and we think well,\nthat's something we wrote down,\n\n220\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.100\nit's a piece of paper,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n221\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.760\nAnd if it's a recording, so I have a\nvoicemail, can't I call that a recording?\n\n222\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.790\nCan't I enter that information\non a voicemail into data?\n\n223\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.030\nMaybe somebody made a video or\na recording like this,\n\n224\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.800\nthe TV show that we're\nstreaming to you live.\n\n225\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.390\nIt's being recorded, a lot of you gonna\nwatch it after it's been done live.\n\n226\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.704\nAnd as a result,\nit's essentially a recording.\n\n227\n00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:10.110\nWould that be offered, potentially\ncould it be offered as evidence?\n\n228\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.560\nWell, it depends on several factor so\nfor instance, writings and\n\n229\n00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.708\nrecordings consist of the following.\n\n230\n00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:17.770\nLetters, words, or numbers or\n\n231\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.780\ntheir equivalent, set down by handwriting,\ntypewriting, cuz people do that today.\n\n232\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.440\nHandwriting, typewriting, printing,\nphotostatting, a bonus for\n\n233\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.500\nanybody who knows what photostatting is.\n\n234\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.820\nYou know what it is, but\nanybody else out there.\n\n235\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.490\nPhotostatting, photographing,\nmagnetic impulse, mechanical,\n\n236\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.730\nor electronic recording, or\nother form of data compilation.\n\n237\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:45.030\nThat is the statutory legal definition\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence for\n\n238\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.560\nwhat writings and recordings must be in\norder to essentially meet the burden to be\n\n239\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.190\nimplemented and to be accepted as evidence\nin a court of law in the United States.\n\n240\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.700\nAnd again, many countries around\nthe world will follow that same standard.\n\n241\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.860\nI'm not saying it's only the US,\nI'm just pointing out that that's\n\n242\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.390\nthe specific language that\nthe United States courts follow.\n\n243\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.429\nWhat about photographs?\n\n244\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.410\nInteresting, photographs include\nstill photos, x-ray film, videotapes,\n\n245\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.460\nas in what we're potentially doing now,\nand motion pictures.\n\n246\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.880\nThat's considered to be a photograph,\nmeaning a photograph is a traditional\n\n247\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.220\nphotograph, but\nit could also be a medical x-ray.\n\n248\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.200\nIt could be a videotape and or\na movie of some kind, interesting.\n\n249\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.238\nHow about those flipbooks, you know\nthe ones where you have the animated thing\n\n250\n00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:30.360\nwith the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n\n251\n00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.908\n&gt;&gt; That would kind of be between-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] when you were a kid in your\n\n252\n00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:32.813\nmath book, remember [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that would be between\nwritings and recordings and\n\n254\n00:13:34.917 --> 00:13:36.575\nphotographs cuz it's\nkind of between the two.\n\n255\n00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:38.291\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it,\n\n256\n00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:42.630\nit's not essentially, it's not, it's\na series of photographs or a series of\n\n257\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:47.135\nsketched items that, essentially through\ntime lapse, as you flip them, move.\n\n258\n00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:50.490\nBut it's not classified under\nthe photograph statute.\n\n259\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.770\nIt's essentially probably entered\nunder writings and recordings.\n\n260\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.832\nWritings recording consist of letters,\nwords, or numbers or\n\n261\n00:13:56.832 --> 00:13:58.690\ntheir equivalent, set down by hand.\n\n262\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.660\nWriting and essentially drawing\nwould be considered handwriting.\n\n263\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.620\nSo it would probably fall under\nthat category, but it would not be\n\n264\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.965\nconsidered a photograph, even though\nit's essentially a series of images.\n\n265\n00:14:07.965 --> 00:14:09.960\nSo it's a question of interpreting-\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n266\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.270\n&gt;&gt; How that would happen,\nif you think about it.\n\n267\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.130\nYou'd still get it in, but\n\n268\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.940\nit's a question of just under what\ndefinition it would qualify as.\n\n269\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.300\nHow do we know it's original?\n\n270\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.780\nThe original of a writing or recording\nis the writing or recording itself or\n\n271\n00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.120\nany counterpart intended to have\nthe same effect by a person\n\n272\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.920\nexecuting or issuing it.\n\n273\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.750\nSo it is up to the person that's executing\nor issuing it to certify it is original.\n\n274\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.680\nWhat about a duplicate?\n\n275\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.390\nIn other words,\nif we know what an original is,\n\n276\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.960\nwhat's essentially a duplicate, a copy?\n\n277\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.420\nHow do we clarify that?\n\n278\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.724\nThe duplicate is the counterpart produced\nby the same impression as the original or\n\n279\n00:14:41.724 --> 00:14:45.722\nfrom the same matrix or by means of\nphotography, including enlargements and\n\n280\n00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:46.783\nminiaturization.\n\n281\n00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:51.326\nOr by mechanical or electronic\nre-recording or by chemical reproduction\n\n282\n00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:55.905\nor other equivalent techniques that\naccurately reproduce the original.\n\n283\n00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:59.095\nTa-da!\n\n284\n00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:03.000\nSo, I mean, this is what you have to wade\nthrough when you do this kind of work.\n\n285\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.600\nBecause you have to go\nthrough all this stuff.\n\n286\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.280\nUnderstand the rules that are in play.\n\n287\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.230\nUnderstand that I can create\na copy of something and\n\n288\n00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.850\nenter it into evidence if I have\ndone it under certain conditions.\n\n289\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.530\nPhotographs can be copied,\nI mean that's perfectly legitimate.\n\n290\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.600\nBut they have to be done\na certain way in order to qualify.\n\n291\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.343\nOtherwise, we may not be able to enter\nthem because we may not have the original.\n\n292\n00:15:25.343 --> 00:15:28.600\nAnd we may not be able to qualify\nthe copy as being legitimate.\n\n293\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.260\n&gt;&gt; I think it just goes to show how,\n\n294\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.290\ngenerally, we tend to think\nin our everyday lives.\n\n295\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:38.620\nAnd when we get into something like being\na CHFI or doing forensic work, we really\n\n296\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:44.130\nneed to start thinking more appointed,\nmore focused, more about the minutia.\n\n297\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.218\nEvery little detail is going to count, and\n\n298\n00:15:46.218 --> 00:15:50.109\nthat's really what I'm getting out of\nthe fact that, yeah, a photograph.\n\n299\n00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.239\nI would think, [NOISE] it's a picture\nof something that actually happened.\n\n300\n00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:55.259\nOf course it'll be, but\nwhat kind of photograph is it?\n\n301\n00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:56.536\nIs it a motion picture?\n\n302\n00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:59.473\nIs it a reproduction of\na photograph that's a photograph?\n\n303\n00:15:59.473 --> 00:16:01.485\nIs it a photograph of a photograph?\n\n304\n00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:04.798\nYou start having to really define\nwhat it is you're talking about.\n\n305\n00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.701\nBecause that could be\nimportant as evidence.\n\n306\n00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.010\nIt is.\nSo for instance, a painting.\n\n307\n00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.937\nI mean think about a painting.\n\n308\n00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:13.930\nA painting is essentially, we would often\njust say, well, a painting is a picture.\n\n309\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.730\nThat's how you often define.\n\n310\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.790\nYou know, you talk to people, well, I\nhave a painting, I have a picture, right?\n\n311\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.956\nA painting's a painting, right?\n\n312\n00:16:18.956 --> 00:16:23.110\nBut the idea is that a painting,\nin the strict definition of photographs,\n\n313\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.950\nphotographs include still photos, X-ray\nfilms, videotapes and motion pictures.\n\n314\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.480\nNowhere in there does it say\nphotographs include paintings.\n\n315\n00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.330\nAnd paintings are not still photographs.\n\n316\n00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.060\n&gt;&gt; No they are not.\n\n317\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:39.190\n&gt;&gt; But believe it or not, we actually\nallow them to be introduced into evidence,\n\n318\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.520\nunder either the writing and\nrecording or photograph standard,\n\n319\n00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.800\nbecause still photographs,\nyou stretch that category.\n\n320\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.299\nA painting in theory,\nwe often hear refered to as a still life.\n\n321\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.860\nThat's true.\n\n322\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.020\n&gt;&gt; And so it's often interpreted\nas a still photograph.\n\n323\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.110\nBecause the definition of writing and\nrecordings.\n\n324\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.200\nWritings and recordings consist\nof letters, words, or numbers or\n\n325\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.275\ntheir equivalent set down through\nhandwriting, typewriting, printing,\n\n326\n00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:07.785\nbecause printing, painting, hard to say,\nphotostatting, photocopying, not painting,\n\n327\n00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:12.775\nalthough photostatting, painting if you're\ncopying a still life in theory right?\n\n328\n00:17:12.775 --> 00:17:17.195\nPhotographing, well photographing is what\nwe produce photographs from, magnetic\n\n329\n00:17:17.195 --> 00:17:22.405\nimpulse, mechanical electronic recording,\nor other forms of data compilation.\n\n330\n00:17:22.405 --> 00:17:25.205\nWell, painting can be considered\na form of data compilation.\n\n331\n00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:28.060\nSo again, it falls under one or\nmore of those categories, but\n\n332\n00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.480\nit's not clearly stated in either one.\n\n333\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.390\nYou have to interpret those.\n\n334\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.800\nA judge does, and decides, okay, yeah,\n\n335\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.560\nbased on the standard, I can clearly\nsee where, although it doesn't say,\n\n336\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.380\nand by the way, Adam, painting also\napplies here, I can clearly see\n\n337\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.850\nwhere we could introduce a painting as\na result of understanding that definition.\n\n338\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.260\nAnd so sometimes it is\na question of interpretation.\n\n339\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.130\n&gt;&gt; I don't see holo images in here either.\n\n340\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Holographs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n341\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Holographs, well, they would fall\nunder the writing recording clause.\n\n342\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.340\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Because of the fact, well, yeah, again,\n\n343\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.230\nif we go back, right.\n\n344\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.595\nFor the third time, right.\n\n345\n00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:03.425\nFurther back, and we reach her yet again.\n\n346\n00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:06.745\nCan we put it up on the screen and\nhave it roll by so you can point to it?\n\n347\n00:18:06.745 --> 00:18:08.315\nSo if we go back and\nreview it one more time.\n\n348\n00:18:08.315 --> 00:18:12.290\nAnd Daniel brings up an interesting point,\nwhich is the march of technology, right?\n\n349\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.915\nSo, when this thing may have been written,\n\n350\n00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:18.150\nI don't know when the the Rule 1001\ndefinitions were updated last, and\n\n351\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.420\nhow old they are, but I'm guessing\nthey're decades old at this point.\n\n352\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.170\nAnd while they are updated over time,\n\n353\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.930\nthere's clearly no implementation\nrecently that says by the way,\n\n354\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.790\nthings like holographs and\nstuff like that are also included.\n\n355\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.210\nBut if we go back and we take a look, So\nagain, writings and recordings, right?\n\n356\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.730\nConsist of letters, words, or numbers,\nor their equivalents, set down through,\n\n357\n00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.200\nthis is the important part,\nhandwriting, typewriting, printing,\n\n358\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.830\nphotostating, photographing,\nmagnetic impulse.\n\n359\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.570\nThat would be where you would bring\ninformation in, mechanical or\n\n360\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.460\nelectronic recording, or\nother forms of data compilation.\n\n361\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.110\nAny one or all of those statements\nwould involve things in the computer\n\n362\n00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.710\nrealm the digital realm things like\nholographs would fall in that category.\n\n363\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.070\nSo there you go.\n\n364\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.060\nSo anybody else want to\nplay stomp the Trump.\n\n365\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.310\nWe could do that alright,\nsend your comments and\n\n366\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.700\nquestions in to the chat and the Daniel\nwill feed them to me in real time.\n\n367\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.370\nAll right so lets continue talking\nabout some of the interesting stuff\n\n368\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.170\nassociated with this, like to go to my\nmachine for just a minute if we could.\n\n369\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.840\nI want to show you, as we often do.\n\n370\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.970\nCould we go full screen just to\nshow them the website there?\n\n371\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:22.590\nThank you.\n\n372\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.500\nWant to show you an FBI archive.\n\n373\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.580\nAnd again, Daniel will have this URL for\nyou in the show notes.\n\n374\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.637\nDon't worry about squinting and\ntrying to copy it all out.\n\n375\n00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:31.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a rather long one, so\n\n376\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.620\nyou don't wanna worry about that.\n\n377\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.220\nBut it's not so\nimportant that it's at the FBI per se,\n\n378\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.150\nit just happens to be where\nthis information will be found.\n\n379\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.265\nBut it's from the Forensic Science\nCommunications newsletter.\n\n380\n00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:47.295\nAnd what it speaks to is the scientific\nworking group on digital evidence,\n\n381\n00:19:47.295 --> 00:19:51.805\nwhat's called the SWGDE and\nthe International organization\n\n382\n00:19:51.805 --> 00:19:55.705\non digital evidence,\nwhat's called the IOCE.\n\n383\n00:19:55.705 --> 00:20:02.205\nWhich is a group that was created\nback in the early 2000's.\n\n384\n00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:07.830\nAnd is going to set the standard For a lot\nof the things that we're talking about.\n\n385\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.740\nThis is where we get\nthe international principles for\n\n386\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.850\ndigital evidence handling from.\n\n387\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.180\nAnd so when I talk about the United\nStates Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n388\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.050\nthey interpret and\nessentially adjust these standards,\n\n389\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.130\nalthough they were written well before\nthese standards were promulgated.\n\n390\n00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.450\nIt was a kind of a chicken and\negg conversation.\n\n391\n00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.520\nThe Federal Standards of the US\ncame before these standards did,\n\n392\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.110\nbut they've been aligned more\nclosely in recent years and\n\n393\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.110\nas a result, they kind of\nare very similar to one another.\n\n394\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.210\nBut the international principles for\ndigital evidence come from this working\n\n395\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.070\ngroup, proposed standards for the exchange\nof digital evidence right here.\n\n396\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.320\nAnd you can take a look at them and\nyou can go through.\n\n397\n00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.370\nAnd there's six standards\nwe'll take a look at and\n\n398\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.230\nwe'll talk about here in just a minute.\n\n399\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:55.870\nBut you can see as you scroll down, it\ntalks about the different principles here.\n\n400\n00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.410\nPrinciple one and\nsome of the standards and\n\n401\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.730\ncriteria, and it goes through and\nhelps us to understand.\n\n402\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.060\nYou could drill through and\nsee all of them, what they are.\n\n403\n00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.480\nSo the IO CE was established in 1995,\n\n404\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.080\nprovides international\nlaw enforcement agencies\n\n405\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.100\na forum to exchange information with\nregards to criminalistics and forensics.\n\n406\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.725\nAnd it's a very important part\nof What we talk about here,\n\n407\n00:21:20.725 --> 00:21:24.385\nbecause it is important for\nus as investigators to be aware of that.\n\n408\n00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.897\nSo, again, all I did was go out,\ngo to Google,\n\n409\n00:21:26.897 --> 00:21:32.000\nkind of do a search for IOCE information,\ncame up with a site that shows you\n\n410\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.280\nthe general background\ngives you a little history.\n\n411\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.140\nAlso shows you the important principles\nwe're going to talk about here in\n\n412\n00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:37.640\njust a minute.\n\n413\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.800\nAnd thought it would be good\nto throw that up for you.\n\n414\n00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.280\nSo you guys can do a little research\non your own, drill down a little bit,\n\n415\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.680\nhave a good reliable source that\nyou can refer to that's going to\n\n416\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.460\ngive you proper information.\n\n417\n00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.480\nIt's not going to\nnecessarily take you off and\n\n418\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.190\ngive you a bunch of crazy stuff\nthat may or may not be accurate.\n\n419\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.490\nSo you just want to be aware of that.\n\n420\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.860\nSo what are the six principals with\nregarding international handling\n\n421\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.630\nof digital evidence?\n\n422\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.611\nNumber one,\nwhen dealing with digital evidence,\n\n423\n00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.670\nwant to make sure all\nthe forensics procedures and\n\n424\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.390\npolicies that have to be in place and\napplied and are followed.\n\n425\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.350\nSo we have to be able to\nverify the chain of custody,\n\n426\n00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.920\nto follow the rules of evidence, have\nto do all of the things we need to do.\n\n427\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.760\nUpon seizing digital evidence, actions\ntaken should not damage that evidence.\n\n428\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.900\nWe've talked about this and\nwhy this is so important.\n\n429\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.790\nSo we don't wanna take that\nevidence as we talked about, right?\n\n430\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.030\nAnd you shove it in our backpack,\nthrow the backpack in the trunk.\n\n431\n00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.400\nLeave it in there all week and\nwe'll be going to the beach, right?\n\n432\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.780\nAll the crazy stuff, don't wanna do that.\n\n433\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.560\nNumber three, when it is necessary for\nperson access the original evidence.\n\n434\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.390\nThat person needs to be trained and\n\n435\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.010\nit needs to have forensic\nskills in order to do so.\n\n436\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.720\nSo we cannot just let them\nwork with original evidence.\n\n437\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.340\nUnless they've been trained as\na forensic investigator to do so\n\n438\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.170\nsafely, without violating the integrity\nof that evidence, very important.\n\n439\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.140\nAll activities related to seizure,\naccess, storage, or\n\n440\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.840\ntransfer of the digital evidence\nhave to be fully documented,\n\n441\n00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.990\npreserved, and there has to be\na chain of custody that is created.\n\n442\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.250\nWe've talked about this.\n\n443\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.990\nThat chain of custody, that evidence\nhas to be available for a review.\n\n444\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.850\nWe've talked about this.\n\n445\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.620\nI actually showed you one of our prior\nshows a couple of different sample\n\n446\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.240\nof forms.\n\n447\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.810\nOne was a chain of custody form, right,\nthat you could use that would be a typical\n\n448\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.840\nchain of custody form that an investigator\nor an investigative agency would have.\n\n449\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.820\nAnd would use to be able to allow people\nto sign out and interact with information,\n\n450\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.560\nso be aware of that.\n\n451\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.640\nAll individuals are responsible for\n\n452\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.790\nany actions taken with respect to the\ndigital exchange and the digital evidence\n\n453\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.190\ninformation that they work with while the\ndigital evidence is in their possession.\n\n454\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.370\nMeaning, if I check out information,\nI check out evidence,\n\n455\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.660\nI'm an investigator and I'm working\nwith it, I'm responsible for it.\n\n456\n00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.580\nIf something goes wrong,\n\n457\n00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.960\nit's essentially my responsibility\nbecause I'm the one in charge.\n\n458\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.920\nI'm the one who said I'm willing\nto accept the liability of\n\n459\n00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.820\nworking with that evidence.\n\n460\n00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.220\nSo I have to pay attention.\n\n461\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.670\n&gt;&gt; You drop in your spaghetti soup\nwhile you're cooking and looking at it,\n\n462\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.324\nyou're going to be in trouble.\n\n463\n00:23:54.324 --> 00:23:56.425\n&gt;&gt; That would be a bad thing.\n\n464\n00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:59.291\nYou would have a problem.\n\n465\n00:23:59.291 --> 00:24:00.746\nThe evidence fairies will come and\nvisit you,\n\n466\n00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:02.135\nand boy are they not gonna be happy,\nright?\n\n467\n00:24:02.135 --> 00:24:03.664\n&gt;&gt; No.\nAll right, and then finally,\n\n468\n00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:07.247\nany agency that's responsible for\nseizing, accessing, and/or storing or\n\n469\n00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:10.850\ntransferring digital data has to be\ncompliant with these principles as well.\n\n470\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.128\nMeaning it's not just the individual, not\njust the investigator, but it's the actual\n\n471\n00:24:15.128 --> 00:24:19.005\nagency that they work with and work for\nthat has to go to the trouble, the length,\n\n472\n00:24:19.005 --> 00:24:23.058\nand the expense of making sure everybody\nthat's involved in this process is trained\n\n473\n00:24:23.058 --> 00:24:25.594\nand understands how to behave and\nact accordingly.\n\n474\n00:24:25.594 --> 00:24:27.240\nRight, this is all gonna\nbe very important.\n\n475\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.150\nSo wanna think about that, and\nmake sure we're aware of that, and\n\n476\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.180\nunderstand that because this is\ngonna become something that,\n\n477\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.710\nfrom our perspective,\nwe really have to focus on.\n\n478\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.630\nThe idea of allowing trained individuals,\n\n479\n00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.360\nright, to interact with data,\nto forensically examine data, but to do so\n\n480\n00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.400\nsoundly is such an important\npart of what we do.\n\n481\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.350\nWe've already talked a bit\nabout where data is and\n\n482\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.260\nthe kind of things we have to look for\nand what we need to be aware of.\n\n483\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.417\nThe data's not always erased even\nthough it's potentially deleted.\n\n484\n00:24:53.417 --> 00:24:55.465\nWe've done the demonstration\nto show you that.\n\n485\n00:24:55.465 --> 00:24:58.245\nWe often refer to that as\nbeing Where Waldo's data is.\n\n486\n00:24:58.245 --> 00:25:01.540\nYou play Where's Waldo, right, so when\nyou think about Where Waldo's data is,\n\n487\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.619\nit's really just a way of talking about\nwhere the data may be in the machine.\n\n488\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.870\nAnd the fact that data's not\nwhere it's supposed to be,\n\n489\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.870\nremember, doesn't mean it's not there.\n\n490\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.470\nIt just means that we have to\nwork a little harder to find it.\n\n491\n00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.540\nBut what about digital evidence in\nthe examination process overall?\n\n492\n00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.950\nThere are five steps we often talk about\nwith regards to examination of digital\n\n493\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.475\nevidence.\n\n494\n00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:21.140\nI wanna share those with you.\n\n495\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.860\nStep number one,\n\n496\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.960\nevidence assessment, we often think\nof this as scoping and tailoring.\n\n497\n00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.570\nEssentially filtering and\n\n498\n00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.730\nnarrowing our focus to zero in on\nevidence that will be valuable.\n\n499\n00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.080\nBut also, be aware of everything, right?\n\n500\n00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.640\nBut filter out and kinda put off to the\nside stuff that may not be relevant and\n\n501\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.880\nmay not be impactful for\nour investigation.\n\n502\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.580\nIf I find five coffee cups sitting on\na table, but four of them prove to be\n\n503\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.640\nempty and there's nothing of substance\nin them, I wanna note all five but\n\n504\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.590\nI wanna focus on the one that has\nsomething left in it, because that's one\n\n505\n00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.090\nthat something was done when somebody was\nhandling, they were drinking from it.\n\n506\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.080\nThere's probably DNA samples\nthat are available there.\n\n507\n00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.132\nThere maybe DNA samples on all five.\n\n508\n00:25:58.132 --> 00:25:59.850\nWe'd wanna eliminate them and\n\n509\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.778\nmake sure we understand that there's\nnothing unusual about the other four.\n\n510\n00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:05.160\nBut the fact they're empty, stacked up and\n\n511\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.300\njust sitting there like in a stack means\nthe chances are good they are not as\n\n512\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.961\nvaluable to us as the one\nthat's got coffee left in it.\n\n513\n00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:13.294\nAll right, so that's important,\nand especially if we're thirsty.\n\n514\n00:26:13.294 --> 00:26:14.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We need a little coffee,\n\n515\n00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:16.216\nthen take a little sip and you're good.\n\n516\n00:26:16.216 --> 00:26:18.712\n&gt;&gt; I logged that,\nnow I can have some, right?\n\n517\n00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:19.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I found it,\n\n518\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.380\nit was empty when I found it.\n\n519\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.840\nI don't know, there was nothing there,\nbut I did get DNA off it.\n\n520\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.060\nBut I have to eliminate my\nfingerprints cuz I looked at it.\n\n521\n00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.880\nAnd hey, what can I say?\n\n522\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.890\nSo evidence assessment, scoping and\ntailoring, point number one.\n\n523\n00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.720\nEvidence acquisition, step number two.\n\n524\n00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.570\nWhat was or is the role of the system?\n\n525\n00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.670\nIn other words, what was the system that\nwe are looking at as having evidence\n\n526\n00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.670\nused for?\n\n527\n00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.970\nWe have to answer the question,\nthe why, the how, the what, right?\n\n528\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.900\nThese are questions we wanna focus on.\n\n529\n00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.810\nWhat role did this system play?\n\n530\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.030\nWhy was it used?\n\n531\n00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.010\nHow was it used?\n\n532\n00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.290\nWhen was it used?\n\n533\n00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.380\nBy whom?\n\n534\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.110\nTo what end?\n\n535\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.530\nFor what purpose?\n\n536\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.220\nRight.\nThese are things we need to be aware of.\n\n537\n00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.210\nSo things like imaging and bitstream\ncopying of the hard drive itself.\n\n538\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.970\nWe've talked about this and wanna make\nsure we understand that that's important.\n\n539\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.450\nWrite protection has to be\nused to write block the data.\n\n540\n00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.470\nSo when we make the bitstream copy,\nwe're streaming data out of the device but\n\n541\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.360\nnot allowing any data to move back in to\nupset in any way, or modify the original.\n\n542\n00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.270\nComplete documentation of all evidence,\n\n543\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.650\nwe have to document everything,\nwithout exception.\n\n544\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.880\nRemember, photograph everything, right,\nvideotape, or photograph, as appropriate.\n\n545\n00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.470\nWe don't touch a thing until we have\na complete accurate record of everything.\n\n546\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.240\nIt's very important to think about that.\n\n547\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.230\nStorage devices have to be looked at.\n\n548\n00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.700\nSo in other words, hard drives have to be\nexamined to ensure that we can account for\n\n549\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.560\nall space.\n\n550\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.220\nWe'll talk about in some future episodes,\nhard drive geometry,\n\n551\n00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.150\nlooking at the headers, looking at\nthe drive map to understand whether\n\n552\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.740\nthere's slack space or\nwhite space that is on the drive.\n\n553\n00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.760\nThere always is.\n\n554\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.870\nWhether that space is being used,\nwhether it's not being used.\n\n555\n00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.080\nIs it accounted for?\n\n556\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.460\nJust because we look at the drive\nin Windows Explorer, or\n\n557\n00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.960\nin the equivalent on a Linux,\nor Unix, or Apple machine and\n\n558\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.170\nwe look at the file explorer, doesn't mean\nwe're seeing everything on the drive.\n\n559\n00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.196\nIt simply means we're seeing\na representation of what that file system\n\n560\n00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:09.208\nallows us to see.\n\n561\n00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.055\nBut there's other stuff\non that hard drive, or\n\n562\n00:28:11.055 --> 00:28:13.930\npotentially in that storage medium,\nthat we're not gaining access to.\n\n563\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.892\nAnd that's very important for us,\nas investigators, to know because we then\n\n564\n00:28:17.892 --> 00:28:21.912\nhave to use tools that will allow us to\npeer into the drive and examine the drive,\n\n565\n00:28:21.912 --> 00:28:24.720\nthe physical medium itself,\nin a different way.\n\n566\n00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.450\nEssentially seeing it all as opposed to\nonly seeing what we're allowed to see.\n\n567\n00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.230\nSo this becomes very important.\n\n568\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.500\nLogging, logging, logging, right?\n\n569\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.530\nNo matter what we do,\nno matter where we do it,\n\n570\n00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.970\nthere's always a reference\nto it somewhere.\n\n571\n00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:40.730\nWe have to go look for those logs and not\njust the common logs that we talked about\n\n572\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.720\nin event viewer in a Windows system,\nbut there are other logs.\n\n573\n00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.160\nThere are text files that are created\nthat are stored in the system.\n\n574\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.750\nThere are logs on devices\nas we were talking about.\n\n575\n00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.560\nThings like hard drives or\nhard drives, I'm sorry.\n\n576\n00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.420\nThings like routers, right,\nare gonna have logs.\n\n577\n00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.150\nWe're gonna often send these logs out to\ncentral sys log or central semsystems.\n\n578\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.700\nWe wanna be able to gather that\ninformation and look at it.\n\n579\n00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.300\nIt's gonna be very important for us.\n\n580\n00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.100\nWhat about memory, processes, caches,\n\n581\n00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.880\nregisters, all the temporary dynamic data\nlocations where we store information?\n\n582\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.000\nWe gotta be aware of those.\n\n583\n00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.580\nSo we're gonna gather all that up.\n\n584\n00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.800\nEvidence preservation right, we often talk\nabout the golden rule, do no harm, right?\n\n585\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.840\nSo we have to make sure\nwe preserve all evidence,\n\n586\n00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.900\npreserve it in a forensically sound way.\n\n587\n00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.380\nI often refer to this as\nusing full body armor, right?\n\n588\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.300\nThe idea is that you've gotta go in fully\nprotected and not in any way, shape or\n\n589\n00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.270\nform take any activity or undertake any\naction that will modify the original, and\n\n590\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:36.910\nin so doing,\n\n591\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.990\ncause you to lose access to that data\ncuz it's no longer forensically sound.\n\n592\n00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.640\nEvidence examination and\nanalysis, again golden rule,\n\n593\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.580\ndo nothing to the original,\ncan't stress that often enough.\n\n594\n00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.410\nWe always have to work on copies.\n\n595\n00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.430\nThere's never a compelling reason for\n\n596\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.740\nus to work on an original if\na forensically sound copy exists.\n\n597\n00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.000\nIt's as good as the original.\n\n598\n00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.730\nIt's the same.\n\n599\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.640\nIt's identical.\n\n600\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.330\nThat's the whole point behind it.\n\n601\n00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.490\nAnd as a result, we should never have to\ngo to the original, except in rare cases\n\n602\n00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.690\nwhere we may have to make another\nforensically sound copy to then work on.\n\n603\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.830\nAnd so there is a legitimate reason\nto interact with the original from\n\n604\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.700\ntime to time.\n\n605\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.950\nBut the idea's that we would simply be\ncreating a bitstream copy, hatching it,\n\n606\n00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.320\nforensically checking it to make sure\nit's an accurate representation.\n\n607\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.590\nThe original goes back in the vault,\nso to speak.\n\n608\n00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.780\nNot in the fire safe, though.\n\n609\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.580\nWe don't wanna put it there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n610\n00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.140\n&gt;&gt; But back in the vault, right?\n\n611\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.240\nAnd then as a result,\nwe're gonna work on that copy.\n\n612\n00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.650\nBecause again, if we work on the original\nand we screw anything up there,\n\n613\n00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.510\nwe're done, right?\n\n614\n00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.230\nAt that point,\nthere's nothing else to say.\n\n615\n00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.770\nWe just pack our stuff up and we go become\n\n616\n00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.040\nsomething else cuz we're not doing\nforensics anymore at that point, right?\n\n617\n00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.390\nOnly if we tell people, though.\n\n618\n00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.132\nIf we just pretend nothing happened and\nput it back on the shelf and walk away,\n\n619\n00:30:47.132 --> 00:30:48.753\nmaybe nobody'll know, right?\n\n620\n00:30:48.753 --> 00:30:51.747\nYou see that in movies sometimes,\nlike oops, and they leave it there and\n\n621\n00:30:51.747 --> 00:30:52.860\nsomebody else finds it.\n\n622\n00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.570\nIt was broken when I found it.\n\n623\n00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.024\nDid you ever see that Big Bang\nepisode with Sheldon and\n\n624\n00:30:58.024 --> 00:31:01.884\nLeonard where Penny buys them the Mr.\nSpock transformer.\n\n625\n00:31:01.884 --> 00:31:03.070\n&gt;&gt; I did not see this.\n\n626\n00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.780\n&gt;&gt; So she gets them both a gift,\na really nice gift, and\n\n627\n00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.090\nshe buys them from the comic book store.\n\n628\n00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:15.390\nShe buys them each this Star Trek beam\nout chamber kind of thing with the Mr.\n\n629\n00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.080\nSpock doll and\nthey're both in pristine condition.\n\n630\n00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.090\nThey haven't been opened.\n\n631\n00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.880\nAnd so Leonard says this is so cool.\n\n632\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.060\nAnd he doesn't open the toy and\nhe leaves it on the desk.\n\n633\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.590\nAnd Sheldon can't control himself,\nwants to play with the toy.\n\n634\n00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.460\nSo he opens his own, and\nhe's playing with it, and he puts his Mr.\n\n635\n00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.092\nSpock down, and there spins it around,\nand then it breaks.\n\n636\n00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:36.150\nAnd he is like, my God, and then.\n\n637\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.080\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n638\n00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.560\nTries put it all together again.\n\n639\n00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.100\nPuts it back in the box,\nleaves it for Leonard.\n\n640\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.770\nTakes Leonard's one, and\npretends that it's not broken.\n\n641\n00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.630\nAnd so then it's like this whole\nthing about how it happened,\n\n642\n00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.030\nand ultimately he's having\nnightmares cuz he's guilty.\n\n643\n00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.937\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So the Mr.\n\n644\n00:31:50.937 --> 00:31:54.407\nSpock doll comes to life and\nis talking to him while he's asleep.\n\n645\n00:31:54.407 --> 00:31:55.812\nAnd just, it's a crazy episode.\n\n646\n00:31:55.812 --> 00:31:57.057\nSo it's kinda funny.\n\n647\n00:31:57.057 --> 00:31:58.218\nIt has nothing to do with\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n648\n00:31:58.218 --> 00:32:00.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those random asides that\n\n649\n00:32:00.025 --> 00:32:01.387\nevery so often just happens.\n\n650\n00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:03.015\nSo we're now gonna come back to, right?\n\n651\n00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:05.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Back to reality.\n\n652\n00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.510\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna come back to the thought\nprocess we're finishing up here.\n\n653\n00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.310\nSo we talked about step three,\nright, evidence preservation.\n\n654\n00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.710\nWhat about step four,\nevidence examination analysis,\n\n655\n00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.210\nwhat we're actually talking about.\n\n656\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.590\nTwo types of extraction of data that\nwe can engage in, physical and or\n\n657\n00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.680\nlogical, right?\n\n658\n00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.510\nPhysical data extraction is really\njust looking at information itself,\n\n659\n00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.370\nthe raw data, the physical data.\n\n660\n00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.560\nNot the file system but as I said, and\n\n661\n00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.530\nI suggested looking at the hard drive\nitself irrespective of the file system.\n\n662\n00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:37.860\nWe may do key word searching,\nwe may examine the partition structures,\n\n663\n00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.930\nlocate the wide space,\nthe headers, things like that.\n\n664\n00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:40.604\nWe may do what's called file carving.\n\n665\n00:32:40.604 --> 00:32:45.245\nWe may look for information and carve\nout certain sectors of the drive, and\n\n666\n00:32:45.245 --> 00:32:49.550\nexamine them deeply with hex editors,\nthings of that nature.\n\n667\n00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.946\nThere's also logical extraction,\nor OS dependent,\n\n668\n00:32:51.946 --> 00:32:55.486\noperating system dependent extraction,\nwhere we're going to extract the file\n\n669\n00:32:55.486 --> 00:32:58.418\nsystem information depending on\nthe operating system involved.\n\n670\n00:32:58.418 --> 00:32:59.998\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n671\n00:32:59.998 --> 00:33:04.185\nwhat we're gonna be able to do\nis look at directory structure,\n\n672\n00:33:04.185 --> 00:33:09.490\nfile attributes, file names, date and\ntime stamps, all the standard stuff.\n\n673\n00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.420\nCould we go back to my machine for\na second.\n\n674\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.118\nAnd I showed you this before, but\nlet me just show you this real quickly.\n\n675\n00:33:14.118 --> 00:33:18.097\nSo if we open up Windows Explorer,\nright, in a Windows machine, and\n\n676\n00:33:18.097 --> 00:33:21.410\nlet's just make that full screen so\nwe can see that.\n\n677\n00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.560\nAnd we go into the C drive,\nright, and we take a look.\n\n678\n00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.990\nAnd we did this before.\n\n679\n00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.190\nYou can see and hear that we have\nour name of all of our folders and\n\n680\n00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.970\nfiles, got that Word document we were\nplaying with in a prior episode there.\n\n681\n00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.710\nGot our date modification information,\nour file type,\n\n682\n00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.700\ngot a little size indicator there.\n\n683\n00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.350\nThese are things that\nare operating system dependent.\n\n684\n00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.390\nThis comes through logical extraction of\ndata, because we're not looking at the raw\n\n685\n00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:52.500\nbits and bytes on the hard drive not\nfiltered through the operating system.\n\n686\n00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.210\nBut we're looking at it filtered\nthrough the OS's graphical interface,\n\n687\n00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.410\nin this case the Windows Explorer\nfile explorer tool.\n\n688\n00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.522\nAnd by doing this,\nwhile we get very valuable data,\n\n689\n00:34:02.522 --> 00:34:07.060\nwe're getting data that is essentially\nallowed for us to be seen,\n\n690\n00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.150\nbecause the operating system has\ndecided this is what's appropriate.\n\n691\n00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.760\nIs there more data on the hard drive\nthat will tell us a lot more about this\n\n692\n00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.680\ninformation?\n\n693\n00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.570\nAbsolutely, but\n\n694\n00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.200\nwe're not seeing it because we'd have to\nlook at it through physical extraction.\n\n695\n00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.700\nWe would use software, and\nlet me be clear, to do this.\n\n696\n00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.670\nBut the physical extraction concept\nbypasses the operating system and\n\n697\n00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.260\nessentially mounts the data as a data, or\nmounts the hard drive as a data source and\n\n698\n00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.230\ndirectly interrogates the drive,\n\n699\n00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.080\nas opposed to us going through\nthe operating system to do so.\n\n700\n00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.978\nSo this is important for\nus to be aware of.\n\n701\n00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:42.770\nWe'll extract metadata here, right, so we\ncan look at, as we've talked about before.\n\n702\n00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.370\nYou right click on a device or\nan item and go to properties.\n\n703\n00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.240\nWe can go in, go to details.\n\n704\n00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.140\nWe can look at, this is one way to\nsee the metadata, not the only way.\n\n705\n00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.867\nBut we can go in and we can look at,\ncan we go full screen here for\n\n706\n00:34:54.867 --> 00:34:55.660\njust one second?\n\n707\n00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.310\nBe a little bit easier to see all that.\n\n708\n00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.980\nWe could see all the metadata here,\nwhen it was created, the Windows user,\n\n709\n00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.810\nthe file type, the name of\nthe computer it was found from.\n\n710\n00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.701\nNotice, by the way, I can remove\nproperties and personal information.\n\n711\n00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:12.980\nSo metadata can be manipulated here,\nwe wanna keep this in mind and\n\n712\n00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:13.823\nbe aware of this.\n\n713\n00:35:13.823 --> 00:35:16.733\nWe can recover deleted files\nusing logical extraction.\n\n714\n00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:20.390\nI've shown you how to do that\nwith the file recovery tool and\n\n715\n00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.940\nthe Paraben P2 Commander\ntool that we took a look at.\n\n716\n00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.540\nWe could extract password protected,\nencrypted or compressed data.\n\n717\n00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.000\nWe could extract file\nslack which is wide space.\n\n718\n00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.820\nWe could take a look at unallocated space.\n\n719\n00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.240\nThere's all this stuff we could do,\nit really just depends on us, but\n\n720\n00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.020\nthe point is this is a different approach.\n\n721\n00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.620\nThis is logical extraction as opposed\nto physical extraction of the data.\n\n722\n00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.251\nSo just be aware of the difference\nhere because there are two methods,\n\n723\n00:35:45.251 --> 00:35:47.840\ntwo mechanisms or\nmethodologies if you will.\n\n724\n00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.259\nWe do wanna make sure we're aware of both,\nand then finally,\n\n725\n00:35:50.259 --> 00:35:52.226\nevidence documentation and\nreporting, right.\n\n726\n00:35:52.226 --> 00:35:55.044\nWe gotta wrap everything up,\nwrite it all down,\n\n727\n00:35:55.044 --> 00:35:58.550\npresent it in a way that's gonna\nbe valuable for our client,\n\n728\n00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.865\nfor the person who has asked us to do\nthe investigation in the first place.\n\n729\n00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:06.930\nAnd we always wind up, by the way, just\nas a standing rule of thumb so you know.\n\n730\n00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.410\nWe always wind up in any of these\nprocesses we kinda walk through,\n\n731\n00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.430\nany of these flows that say, you're gonna\nhave five steps and this is what you do.\n\n732\n00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.050\nWe always start out with, hey, let's\nkinda understand what the evidence is.\n\n733\n00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.563\nLet's understand what we're looking at.\n\n734\n00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:21.406\nAnd then we always wind up\nsomewhere at the bottom with, hey,\n\n735\n00:36:21.406 --> 00:36:25.180\nlet's write it all down, document it,\nand report it back to the customer.\n\n736\n00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.200\nSo if you always know where to start and\nwhere to end,\n\n737\n00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.540\nright, and then it's just the matter\nof putting stuff in the middle,\n\n738\n00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.320\nyou got a really good idea of how\nto deal with these processes.\n\n739\n00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.040\nAnd if you're ever asked about them,\nfor instance on an exam, or\n\n740\n00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.969\nyou have to understand\nhow to reproduce them,\n\n741\n00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:39.553\nyou're gonna have a good sense\nof what that order looks like.\n\n742\n00:36:39.553 --> 00:36:41.835\nAnd it's gonna be really important for\n\n743\n00:36:41.835 --> 00:36:45.983\nyou on the CHFI exam to be able to\nspeak the process steps and say; okay,\n\n744\n00:36:45.983 --> 00:36:50.660\nthese five steps in this order are what\nwe need to do to answer this question.\n\n745\n00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.490\nLet's make sure I know that,\nlet's make sure we focus on that.\n\n746\n00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:57.140\nIt's why we spend time on our episodes,\nnot just talking about the cool stuff,\n\n747\n00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.580\nand the stories, and\ndemoing tools and all that, but\n\n748\n00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.430\nwe also walk you through those steps to\nmake sure you understand what's going on\n\n749\n00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.820\nwith them, because it's very\nimportant to have that knowledge.\n\n750\n00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you can't just\nplay around with evidence, right?\n\n751\n00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.943\nWe have to handle it correctly.\n\n752\n00:37:08.943 --> 00:37:10.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, yeah-\n\n753\n00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.345\n&gt;&gt; But you get in trouble when you-\n\n754\n00:37:11.345 --> 00:37:12.270\n&gt;&gt; You'd better be prepared for\n\n755\n00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.820\nthe consequences of\nthose actions if you do.\n\n756\n00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.503\nAnd that's a good thing\nthat they have given us,\n\n757\n00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:19.270\na procedure that we can follow so\n\n758\n00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.733\nthat we can gather the evidence correctly\nso that it maintains it's integrity.\n\n759\n00:37:23.733 --> 00:37:25.629\nAnd then analyze that evidence so\n\n760\n00:37:25.629 --> 00:37:29.759\nthat we can extrapolate any information\nthat we need out of it in a safe and\n\n761\n00:37:29.759 --> 00:37:34.231\nsecure manner, again maintaining\nthe integrity of the evidence itself, and\n\n762\n00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:38.530\ntherefore being admissible in a court\ncase or wherever we may need it.\n\n763\n00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:43.399\nAdam, fantastic job of reminding us that\nthere's a whole lot involved when we\n\n764\n00:37:43.399 --> 00:37:46.891\nare dealing with and/or\nanalyzing digital evidence.\n\n765\n00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:51.790\nAnd it is not just the case of, well,\nhere's your evidence, there you go and\n\n766\n00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.320\nyou submit that into log B and\nthere you go, we're done.\n\n767\n00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.689\nIt's a bit of a procedure, and we need to\nbe able to follow that and there it is for\n\n768\n00:37:59.689 --> 00:38:00.286\nus today.\n\n769\n00:38:00.286 --> 00:38:04.320\nAdam, looking at the clock though,\nwe've well run out of time.\n\n770\n00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.790\nBut anything else about digital evidence\nthat we need to tell our viewers?\n\n771\n00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.200\n&gt;&gt; There is, but\nthat's why we have upcoming episodes.\n\n772\n00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n773\n00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.430\nGotta love the upcoming episodes, right?\n\n774\n00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.630\nThat's, [LAUGH] where you get\nthe rest of the information.\n\n775\n00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.130\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n776\n00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.170\nThanks for watching.\n\n777\n00:38:18.170 -->

00:00:08.517\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:12.377\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:14.017\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:16.280\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.427\nAnd in today's episode,\nwell it's more on CHFI.\n\n9\n00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:25.833\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\nto disseminate that information from his\n\n10\n00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:30.191\nbrain into ours, our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon, Adam welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:31.671\n&gt;&gt; That's better,\nnow I can actually stand.\n\n12\n00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:33.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How is everybody doing?\n\n13\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.940\nSorry, we're just having little bit of a\nissue with the floor behind the desk here.\n\n14\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.390\nAll right, so anyway, now that I\nhave my feet firmly planted on it,\n\n15\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.110\nit won't go anywhere.\n\n16\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.320\nWe should be fine.\n\n17\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.010\nI'm doing well.\nHopefully all of you are also.\n\n18\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.210\nWe're gonna talk a bit about what\nit means to be a first responder.\n\n19\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.770\nWhen you show up as an investigator,\na lot of times,\n\n20\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.760\nyou may not be the very\nfirst person on the scene.\n\n21\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.030\nYou may be, but you may not be.\n\n22\n00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.940\nAnd more often than not,\nyou're probably not.\n\n23\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.580\nThere are people that have\ngotten there before you.\n\n24\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.750\nAnd have discovered that something\nhas gone wrong, whatever that may be.\n\n25\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.170\nOr have discovered\n\n26\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.040\nthat there may be a reason to consider\nthat something has gone wrong.\n\n27\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.270\nIt really depends on how obvious\nthe issue and concern is.\n\n28\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.390\nBut whatever that is, whoever those\npeople are, we call them first responders\n\n29\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780\nbecause they are the ones that are on\nthe scene before anybody else.\n\n30\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320\nVery often it's not\nthe person that actually is\n\n31\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.760\ntrained forensically to be able\nto deal with what they find.\n\n32\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.530\nHopefully, we understand that those people\nare gonna be able to do one thing and\n\n33\n00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910\none thing only, which is they will\nhave the presence of mind, right,\n\n34\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.470\nthe thought process, the awareness to\nnot go in and start poking around.\n\n35\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.270\nBut hopefully simply, stop,\nsecure the scene, you'll\n\n36\n00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530\nmake sure nobody else goes in, and make\na phone call and or help us to understand\n\n37\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.090\nthat there's something that someone\nneeds to come and pay attention to.\n\n38\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.690\nSo you wanna think about that.\n\n39\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.330\nBut assuming for a minute that we broaden\nthe definition of first responder,\n\n40\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.690\nto include the fact that\nthe person that will actually\n\n41\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310\nforensically respond to this event\nfirst will be the first responder,\n\n42\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.250\nmeaning you're the first\ninvestigator on the scene.\n\n43\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180\nThe first security professional that may\nhave some basic training to understand how\n\n44\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.180\nto secure a work station and\nprevent any future harm from coming to it.\n\n45\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.940\nBy either disconnecting\nit from the network or\n\n46\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.840\njust making sure that nobody\ninteracts with it, things like that.\n\n47\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.860\nIf we incorporate those people as first\nresponders, then what we have to think\n\n48\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.460\nabout is what are the requirements,\nwhat are the responsibilities,\n\n49\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.620\nwhat are the things that first\nresponders are often called on to do?\n\n50\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.150\nSo let's talk about some of that.\n\n51\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.620\nSo Daniel, if I asked you as a first\nresponder if you showed up, let's say,\n\n52\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.380\nhypothetically, as a first responder,\nwhat would be some of the things you would\n\n53\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.350\nthink that first responders would probably\nneed to know how to do or be aware of?\n\n54\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.810\n&gt;&gt; At least they would need to know\nhow to secure the area, right?\n\n55\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.570\nTo make sure that none of the evidence\ngets either tainted or leaves,\n\n56\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.750\nthat would be bad.\n\n57\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.480\nWe want to basically cordon off\n\n58\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.250\nwhat we think would be the immediate\narea of the crime scene per se.\n\n59\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.720\n&gt;&gt; All right and\nthat's a very good place to start and\n\n60\n00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530\nessentially what we want first\nresponders to be able to do.\n\n61\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.060\nIdentify the crime scene, protect\nthe crime scene, set up the caution do\n\n62\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.072\nnot cross line tape that kind of stuff,\nput the chalk outline around the body.\n\n63\n00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.460\n&gt;&gt; The server.\n&gt;&gt; Around the server right exactly,\n\n64\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.490\npreserve temporary and\n\n65\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.328\nfragile evidence, make sure machine's\nare not powered off for instance, right?\n\n66\n00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:27.670\nSo that we don't lose the dynamic,\nthe volatile data.\n\n67\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.960\nCollect the complete information\nthat's available about the incident.\n\n68\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.220\nInterview people, take pictures,\nunderstand what's going on,\n\n69\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.640\nmake sure we have an accurate\nrecord of what was happening.\n\n70\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.340\nSo documentation of all findings,\nand packaging and\n\n71\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.950\ntransporting of any evidence\nfrom the scene securely back\n\n72\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.450\nto the evidence lockup or back to the\nforensic lab or whatever is gonna be part\n\n73\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.150\nof that overall first responder who are\nyou, what do you do kind of conversation.\n\n74\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo, wanna be aware of that and\nthink about that and\n\n75\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.340\nfirst responders have to have a tool kit.\n\n76\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.180\nWe've talked about this before as well,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.830\nWe have to show up with our magic bag\nof tricks and have the capability and\n\n78\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.470\nthe resources to do our job.\n\n79\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.440\nWe have to have forensic work stations,\nessentially a machine, a portable machine\n\n80\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.400\nthat we will use to document evidence and\nto process information.\n\n81\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.100\nSo we have to have our operating\nsystem installed, has to be patched.\n\n82\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.300\nWe have to have our tools that are there.\n\n83\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.860\nWe have to be able to test all the tools\nout and do everything we need to do and\n\n84\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.280\nunderstand how to use that system.\n\n85\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.410\nWe use this machine that I demo off of\nfrom time to time and I have a variety of\n\n86\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.470\ntools that are installed there, depending\non what it is we're looking to do.\n\n87\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.070\nThe key there is that we have to document\neverything we do to build that machine.\n\n88\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.660\nKnow what's available to us, and\nknow what we can do with it.\n\n89\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.570\nSo, that way we understand\nhow to use it effectively.\n\n90\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.020\nEspecially, if we're not necessary going\nto be using that machine all the time, but\n\n91\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.150\nonly during investigations onsite.\n\n92\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.310\nTo keep track of evidence, wanna make sure\nwe're up to date with what's going on\n\n93\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.780\nthere and\nwe understand what's happening with it.\n\n94\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.540\nSo the first responder tool kit is\ngonna be very important for us,\n\n95\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.840\nbecause it helps us to be productive and\nbe able to do our job effectively onsite.\n\n96\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.300\nWhat we don't wanna do is have to borrow\nsomeone's computer to type up all\n\n97\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.490\nthe information.\n\n98\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.430\nThat's not gonna be accurate, right?\n\n99\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.750\nCrime scene processing,\nwe need evidence collection tools.\n\n100\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.520\nThings like gloves, we need bags to put\nevidence in, we need sharpie markers or\n\n101\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.910\nsome sort of marker to write\ninformation on the evidence bag.\n\n102\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.440\nWe need picture capabilities, so\nwe need a camera of some kind.\n\n103\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.060\nVideo capability,\nwe need a video camera of some kind.\n\n104\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.900\nOftentimes today,\nthat will all come in one device, right?\n\n105\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.060\nSo digital cameras can take\nvideo as well as pictures, and\n\n106\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.080\nyou can do either one, traditionally.\n\n107\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.950\nWe may need extra memory cards to record\nthat information, extra batteries,\n\n108\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.540\npower cords, extension isobars for that.\n\n109\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.270\nWe talked about lighting being important\nif we work in remote areas, right,\n\n110\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.790\nwe're out on the side of the road\nsomewhere, dealing with the forensic\n\n111\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.280\ninvestigation of a car accident, we\nhave to have lights if it's dark, right?\n\n112\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.687\nYou can't just hold the flashlight up.\n\n113\n00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:57.304\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n114\n00:05:57.304 --> 00:05:59.280\ngo walking through the grass\ntrying to find things.\n\n115\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.920\nI mean, you can but\nit's not very effective.\n\n116\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.436\nWe may need those big cleg lights or\n\n117\n00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:06.080\nwork lights that you often see on the side\nof the road construction crews use.\n\n118\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.210\nYou may have a power generator for\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.330\nThere's a lot of different\nthings you may need.\n\n120\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.100\nYou may need special tools to\nbe able to extract evidence.\n\n121\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.900\nIf the bullet's been fired, and\nit hits a wall, and it's buried, or\n\n122\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.060\nburrowed in the wall.\n\n123\n00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.640\nYou need tools to dig it out.\n\n124\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.860\nRight?\nYou can't go ripping the whole wall apart\n\n125\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.540\nwith your hands.\n\n126\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.550\nYou gotta have forensic forceps, to be\nable to pull something out of the wall.\n\n127\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.650\nYou may need screwdrivers.\n\n128\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.680\nI think you mentioned that\nin one of our conversations.\n\n129\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.280\nYou may have to take apart a computer.\n\n130\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.980\nSomething like that.\n\n131\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.970\nOr unhook cables on the back.\n\n132\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.850\nSo that kind of stuff.\n\n133\n00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.730\nSo different screw drivers,\na hammer is never a bad idea to have,\n\n134\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.320\nyou never know when you're\ngonna need something like that.\n\n135\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.910\nYou know what I had to go out recently and\ndo, living in south Florida as I do,\n\n136\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.365\nand some of you know if you've\nwatched episodes with us before.\n\n137\n00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:54.450\nIt's hurricane season half\nthe year in south Florida and\n\n138\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.170\nof all the things that I have and\nall the tools that I've had for many,\n\n139\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.980\nmany years the one thing I didn't have\nwas believe it or not, a rubber mallet.\n\n140\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.420\nAnd you don't often think about that and\n\n141\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.180\nits not the kind of tool that\ncomes to mind when you say hey,\n\n142\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.460\nwhat's the top tool that\nyou need in your toolbox?\n\n143\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.370\nA rubber mallet is not normally\nsomething that's on the top of the list.\n\n144\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.460\nBut it's very important when you live in\nsouth Florida during hurricane season,\n\n145\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.830\nif you have to put shutters up.\n\n146\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.730\nBecause you often will need a rubber\nmallet to bang the shutters into place,\n\n147\n00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.320\ndepending on the kind\nof shutters you have.\n\n148\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.370\nSo, I don't have one and I had to actually\nhelp my neighbor put his shutters up\n\n149\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.680\nduring this last little storm thing we\nhad going on earlier in the season.\n\n150\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.890\nAnd another neighbor, like all three of us\non either side of this one neighbors house\n\n151\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.590\nwe're helping, cuz it was a big house and\nhe didn't have a ladder.\n\n152\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.580\nHe had, they had just moved in.\n\n153\n00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.150\nTotally like unprepared, right?\n\n154\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And nothing, and so\n\n155\n00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.420\nwe all kind of chipped in and helped out.\n\n156\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.690\nSo I brought over the ladders.\n\n157\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.130\nMy neighbors on the other side\nwas helping him do stuff.\n\n158\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.550\nAnd he had a rubber mallet, and\nhe was banging these shutters into place.\n\n159\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.615\nAnd I'm thinking, wow, it's like that\nepiphany moment, the light bulb goes on,\n\n160\n00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:53.962\nI'm thinking, I'm such an idiot.\n\n161\n00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:57.296\nFor years, I've been up there\ntrying to power theses things in.\n\n162\n00:07:57.296 --> 00:07:59.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You unscrew the thing with the drill,\n\n163\n00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:00.672\nand you screw it back in.\n\n164\n00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:02.922\nAnd.\nYou're up there trying to muscle it down.\n\n165\n00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:03.797\nIt's just a nightmare.\n\n166\n00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:05.129\nAnd I'm like I am such a moron.\n\n167\n00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:06.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanna get a mallet, and\n\n168\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.450\nI'm gonna stand on the ladder, and\nI can just give a couple of good shots.\n\n169\n00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.480\nAnd it's right there.\n\n170\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.340\nThe other way going out, you just hit,\nknock it out, and it comes up.\n\n171\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.660\nSo now now I have, I am the proud\nowner of a wonderful mallet.\n\n172\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.960\nAnd I am now prepared.\n\n173\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.550\n&gt;&gt; It's a prize possession, isn't it?\n\n174\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.740\n&gt;&gt; It is my number one tool now,\nit is just awesome.\n\n175\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.160\nSo, I'm just actually looking for\nopportunities to use it.\n\n176\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.540\nActually brought it with me,\nit's in the car.\n\n177\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.640\nSo if we ever have anything we have\nto do with rubber mallets, I'm ready.\n\n178\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.570\nI will go get it and-\n&gt;&gt; What do they say when you got a hammer\n\n179\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.680\nin your hand and you walk around\nlooking for, everything looks like a-\n\n180\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.830\n&gt;&gt; Everything looks like a nail, right.\n\n181\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.160\nSo now everything looks like a hurricane\nshutter cuz I have my rubber mallet.\n\n182\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.250\nSo my point is you have to be prepared.\n\n183\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.840\nI've had some strange things happen\nwhen I've been on site doing work\n\n184\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.920\nwhere I've needed this\nbizarre thing goes on.\n\n185\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.390\nAnd I've said,\nif I'd just had this thing with me,\n\n186\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.130\nboy I would've been prepared for it.\n\n187\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.120\nYou don't always have it.\n\n188\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.720\nBut over the years, I've developed\na thought process of kind of a checklist.\n\n189\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.250\nI always carry around one of those\nsmall flashlights like the palm ones\n\n190\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.930\nyou could just carry around.\n\n191\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Get them at an auto store.\n\n192\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like those kind of ones, yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.890\nYou keep in the car like in\nthe little glove box, whatever.\n\n194\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.650\nAlways have one of those with me in\nthe car or in somewhere I can get to it.\n\n195\n00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.050\nAlways have a small set of screwdrivers,\nthe ones that are good for\n\n196\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.330\nlike eyeglass repair.\n\n197\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.980\nBecause those typically are good for\nthe screws on a computer or\n\n198\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.370\non the motherboard if you\nhave to remove something.\n\n199\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.390\nGot those, got a set of work gloves but\n\n200\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.510\nnot like the latex gloves\nthat everybody uses.\n\n201\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.450\nThose are important,\nyou need those for evidence handling,\n\n202\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.780\nbut when you're working with computer\nparts you can't use those things.\n\n203\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.262\nThey snag and they tear.\n\n204\n00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:43.680\nSo got a pair of neoprene work\ngloves that are statically neutral\n\n205\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.189\nthat you can throw on and use.\n\n206\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.980\nWe just need to have a can of compressed\nair, because you never know when you're\n\n207\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.400\ngonna have to clean something off, or at\nleast be able to kinda manipulate stuff.\n\n208\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.470\nA little pair of tweezers, right,\nbecause again, small things,\n\n209\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.580\ngotta be able to work with those, or\nhave a child handy, one or the other.\n\n210\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Keep one of those in your toolkit and\nhey, Sara, could you fix this for\n\n212\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.140\nme real quick?\n\n213\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.092\nSure thing, and\ncuz sometimes I have not big hands, but\n\n214\n00:10:08.092 --> 00:10:11.490\nI have normal person size hands for\nan adult.\n\n215\n00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.180\nGetting inside a computer or\n\n216\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.795\nlaptop sometimes, some of those things\nare just really hard to work with.\n\n217\n00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:19.240\n&gt;&gt; And you gotta be really\ncareful obviously, right?\n\n218\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.040\nAnd the most important thing\npeople don't often think about,\n\n219\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.420\nit's the most important thing you also\nneed, Internet access, believe it or not.\n\n220\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.490\nRight?\nBecause a lot of times,\n\n221\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.590\ndepending on the machine that I'm\nlooking at, if I have to open in up and\n\n222\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.390\ntake a look at something after we've kinda\ncaptured everything off the system, if we\n\n223\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.930\nwanna take the memory out of the machine\nor we wanna take the hard drive out or\n\n224\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.440\nwhatever, it may not be obvious\nwhere it is in a laptop.\n\n225\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.540\nA lot of times you got to flip it over,\ntake the thing apart,\n\n226\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.750\nyou don't always know where it is.\n\n227\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.390\nYou may want to look up the technical\nspecs on the machine and\n\n228\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.800\nyou want to be able to see how it's\nset up so you don't break anything.\n\n229\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.310\nRight?\nSo wireless or\n\n230\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.280\nwired access either way but,\ninternet access on a separate machine\n\n231\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.480\non a secured solution is very\nimportant for what we do in the field.\n\n232\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.440\nSo a lot of times you'll carry one of\nthose little wireless hot spots with\n\n233\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.030\nyou and hook that up and use that.\n\n234\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.040\nOr you'll tether,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n235\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.470\nSo you just wanna think about that.\n\n236\n00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.020\nWe also need to have the ability to\nask and answer questions, right?\n\n237\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.010\nWe talked about the standard question\nthe five W's and the H, who, what, when,\n\n238\n00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.910\nwhere, why and how.\n\n239\n00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.380\nWant to make sure we're familiar\nwith that, we understand that,\n\n240\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.720\nwe have a sense of that.\n\n241\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.620\nBut these questions are important, you\nwill wanna know who used the machine last?\n\n242\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.600\nWe wanna know what it was used for,\nwhen it was used?\n\n243\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.280\nUnder what circumstances, right?\n\n244\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.900\nWhat, was somebody sitting down surfing\nthe web, if they were, we wanna go in and\n\n245\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.470\nwe wanna look at the cache.\n\n246\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.640\nThe history for instance.\n\n247\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.970\nCan we go to my machine for a sec?\n\n248\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.260\nLets just take a look at something.\n\n249\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.430\nSo, Daniel I'm gonna ask\nyou to help me out here.\n\n250\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't mind.\n\n251\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.720\nSo as you often do, and I know you're\nvery good at that when I do ask and\n\n252\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.971\nput you on the spot out of the blue.\n\n253\n00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:50.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean I was doing something and\n\n254\n00:11:50.575 --> 00:11:51.079\nI have to help.\n\n255\n00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:52.080\nHe's asking again.\n\n256\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.750\nSo let's just go through this and\ntalk about this for a second.\n\n257\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.140\nSo I'm using Chrome right now, right.\n\n258\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.740\nAnd so I've been out to several websites\nor I've done demonstrations, brought up\n\n259\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.630\nthis last site from the one we were just\ntaking a look at in the prior episode.\n\n260\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.310\nThere's Dr. Locard.\n\n261\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.750\nSo if I go back into Google, or\nto Chrome here rather and I take a look\n\n262\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.700\non the surface, while I can take a look\nat, and pull down information from\n\n263\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.240\nthe cache and the history, I have to know\nwhere to go, right, in order to see it.\n\n264\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So could we go full screen here so\n\n265\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.890\nwe could see this a little bit easier?\n\n266\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.805\nSo I went over here to,\nI guess, the ellipsis, right.\n\n267\n00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:27.940\nBut it's the vertical,\nas opposed to horizontal ellipsis.\n\n268\n00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.070\nA little butt in there.\n\n269\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.700\nSo I can see that there's\na history tab here.\n\n270\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.465\nAnd I can see the history of some\nof the websites I've been to, so\n\n271\n00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:35.825\nthat's pretty obvious.\n\n272\n00:12:35.825 --> 00:12:37.695\nMost web browsers you can do that.\n\n273\n00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:41.545\nWith IE you can probably just pull down\nand you'll see the last five or six, or\n\n274\n00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:46.285\nwhatever it is, and\nyou can go in in Safari and in Firefox and\n\n275\n00:12:46.285 --> 00:12:47.350\ndo the same thing.\n\n276\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.350\nBut are there more sites I've\nbeen to than just those?\n\n277\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.180\nThere probably are.\n\n278\n00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.750\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah.\n\n279\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.780\n&gt;&gt; And we know for\na fact we've been to more than that.\n\n280\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.062\nCan I look at these were\njust recently closed?\n\n281\n00:12:57.062 --> 00:12:58.540\nBut hat if I wanna see all the others?\n\n282\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.260\nWell, I may have some that are bookmarked.\n\n283\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.490\nI don't seem to have any bookmarks\nhere but there may be some.\n\n284\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.760\nI may have to drill in and I may have\nto go in and look for more information.\n\n285\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.150\nSo I may have to go in and\nI can go in here.\n\n286\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.980\nAnd you'll see that I can look for\nbrowsing data.\n\n287\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.920\nNow if somebody was smart\nenough to go in and\n\n288\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.230\nsay, let me clear all that browsing data.\n\n289\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.330\nWe haven't done that of course.\n\n290\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.140\nBut if somebody was, then I may\nhave a tougher time recovering it.\n\n291\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.870\nBut I have tools that'll recover\nthat data as well, remember.\n\n292\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.312\nAll it is, is data stored on the hard\ndrive that, even though it may have been,\n\n293\n00:13:30.312 --> 00:13:34.430\nquote unquote, cleared from the program,\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's gone, right?\n\n294\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.685\nIt's just stuff that I would\nobviously have to know to look for.\n\n295\n00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:40.815\nBut if it's not available to me,\nI don't see it, I may have to go in and\n\n296\n00:13:40.815 --> 00:13:44.955\nI may have to actually look at\nthe settings or I may have to drill in and\n\n297\n00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:49.275\nI may have to see what the advance\nsettings are look for information again.\n\n298\n00:13:49.275 --> 00:13:52.315\nVaries by program, varies by browser.\n\n299\n00:13:52.315 --> 00:13:56.055\nUsually it's up under what we can go and\nup under history right?\n\n300\n00:13:56.055 --> 00:14:00.410\nWe could see a little bit more, we coud\nsee the history here and so we can scroll\n\n301\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.762\ndown and by day you could see I have\nbeen to a lot of different sites.\n\n302\n00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:06.900\nAnd I'd be able to see all this,\nbe able to go in and take a look.\n\n303\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.110\nNow, can I extract this information?\n\n304\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.810\nCan I export it out of the program?\n\n305\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.370\nI could do that forensically and\ncapture it.\n\n306\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.690\nThat wouldn't be a problem.\n\n307\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.350\nI can look at settings.\n\n308\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.240\nI can go in and I can look at\nthe advanced settings in here, and\n\n309\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.930\nI may be able to learn more about\nhow the program is set up and\n\n310\n00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.350\nwhat kind of data is being cached as well.\n\n311\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.180\nSo the importance for us as\ninvestigators is to know where to go,\n\n312\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.540\nwhere to look and\nwhat to do by application.\n\n313\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.860\nBecause if we change over here,\nlet's get out of Chrome for\n\n314\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.790\na second,let's go to Firefox as\nwe did use Firefox at one point.\n\n315\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.190\nSo start up here in just a second.\n\n316\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.710\nGood program that it is,\nit's updating itself.\n\n317\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.050\nSo we'll connect out.\n\n318\n00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.600\nWe've got Firefox.\n\n319\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.240\nAnd again, the same ideas apply.\n\n320\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.000\nWe'd have to know where to go to look.\n\n321\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.010\nSo typically we can come over here,\nopen up our menu right off to the right.\n\n322\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.110\nAnd again, we'll be able to go in and\nsee history.\n\n323\n00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.280\nPretty obvious, it's sitting there\nnormally, it's not too difficult to find.\n\n324\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.780\nWe can go in, and we can see here the\nhistory of the information that was there.\n\n325\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.140\nAgain, Clear History is usually available\nas an option, you wanna know that.\n\n326\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.390\nYou may be able to restore\na previous session.\n\n327\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.270\nBring up what the person that was\nusing the machine may have been doing\n\n328\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.530\neven though we may not know necessarily\nwhat they were or were not up to so\n\n329\n00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.760\nmaybe I would have figured that out so you\nknow by program we can usually go in and\n\n330\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.040\nwe can do those things right.\n\n331\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.760\nWe have IE in here as well although\nI don't think I used IE for\n\n332\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.010\nanything actually but if we go to Windows\n10 which is what the actual machine is\n\n333\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.860\nthat I'm using behind the machine that I'm\nusing we also have browsers here right?\n\n334\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:47.400\nAnd we can go in and\nagain we could bring up Internet Explorer.\n\n335\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.710\nI'm not bringing up the Edge browser.\n\n336\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.820\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say\nyou're not going with Edge?\n\n337\n00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.129\n&gt;&gt; No. No.\nHave I explained how much I love Edge?\n\n338\n00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:57.796\nNo, but\nwe are bringing up Internet Explorer, IE.\n\n339\n00:15:57.796 --> 00:15:59.380\nSo Yeah we have this.\n\n340\n00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.776\nAnd if we go in here,\nagain like any other one,\n\n341\n00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:05.290\nwe'll go to settings here just to\nshow you what this looks like.\n\n342\n00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.500\nWe can go in, we can view downloads which\nis kind of interesting, right, because\n\n343\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.190\nwe can take a look at a slightly different\nthought process with regards to history.\n\n344\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.340\nWe could see what programs\nhave been downloaded and\n\n345\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.110\nwhat information may be available.\n\n346\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.640\nSo we can go in and\nsee if there's been any downloads,\n\n347\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.560\ndoesn't look like there has been, right.\n\n348\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.640\nBut again we could clear that list, but we\nalso could export it so we could see that.\n\n349\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.840\nBut we could come in,\nthis browser lets us pull down you can\n\n350\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.600\nkinda see some of the stuff\nthat was going on in there.\n\n351\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.270\nSo we could take a look that way.\n\n352\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.120\nWe could look at our home site.\n\n353\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.850\nWe can look at favorites again,\njust so we know.\n\n354\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.590\nAgain, we can go in,\nwe can look in here and\n\n355\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:49.040\nin addition to doing all that, we can\ncome in, do our internet options, right?\n\n356\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.180\nWe can take a look at our home page and\nall of that stuff.\n\n357\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:58.420\nBut we can go in and we can take a look\nat, what I'm I looking for here?\n\n358\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.718\nNot that, not that, not that.\n\n359\n00:17:00.718 --> 00:17:01.456\nWhat do I want?\n\n360\n00:17:01.456 --> 00:17:07.250\nI want-\n&gt;&gt; You're looking for the history?\n\n361\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.286\n&gt;&gt; No, I was looking for one other\nthing I wanted to show everybody.\n\n362\n00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:12.577\nYeah, so I was just trying to\nfigure out where certificates was,\n\n363\n00:17:12.577 --> 00:17:13.720\nI couldn't remember.\n\n364\n00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.630\nOne of the other things I want to take\na look at real quick, and this browser's,\n\n365\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.265\nwell, I was gonna say easy to show you,\nbut you gotta remember where it is.\n\n366\n00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:20.840\n[LAUGH] Otherwise it's not so easy.\n\n367\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.930\nBut what I was gonna show you, and\nit's the same in all the other browsers by\n\n368\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.450\nthe way, again it's just\na matter of where to go to look.\n\n369\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.230\nWhat I was gonna show you here is that\nwe can take a look at certificates\n\n370\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.401\nthat have been installed on the system and\nin the program as well.\n\n371\n00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:36.060\nThey may or may not tell us something,\na lot of times we overlook some of\n\n372\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.530\nthe common stuff forensically and it's\nimportant to think about these things.\n\n373\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.230\nYou have the certificates that\nare set up and issued to a system\n\n374\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.840\nare gonna tell us a lot about the programs\nwe run, the software we run, the solutions\n\n375\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.730\nwe deal with and the way in which we our\nestablished trust as we communicate.\n\n376\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.290\nSo one small piece but a very big\npiece of an important puzzle, and so\n\n377\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.670\nwe could look at certificates\nthat have been installed here.\n\n378\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.990\nBecause under Personal,\n\n379\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.940\nwe may have certificates that the person\nit's using the system has installed, and\n\n380\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.980\nwe wanna know about those and\ncapture those as well.\n\n381\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.080\nSo there's a lot of information that we\ncould at based on a particular program\n\n382\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.650\nthat we are interacting with, and\nbased on having knowledge of it.\n\n383\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.560\nIt will help us to better understand what\nthe things are we may want to capture\n\n384\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.120\nfrom a forensic standpoint\njust in the web.\n\n385\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.490\nThis is just one element of a much larger,\nbroader puzzle just be aware of that.\n\n386\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.190\nWe always have to have consent\nto search we talk about this and\n\n387\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.590\nwhy this is important.\n\n388\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.310\nThe witness that saw\nthe information unfold,\n\n389\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.750\nthat saw the event occur,\nmay not be able to give us consent, so\n\n390\n00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.940\nwe have to think about the fact that\nthe system owner may have to be found.\n\n391\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.870\nWe talked about the fact that if I own\nthis computer, I let somebody sit down and\n\n392\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.130\nuse it, I walk away.\n\n393\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.520\nThey effectively, at that point, have\nthe right to give consent to a search,\n\n394\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.710\neven though I'm not there.\n\n395\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.990\nWe've talked about the different\nways in which consent can be given.\n\n396\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.950\nIf you're a minor living\nin your parents' house,\n\n397\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.230\nthe parents have the right to give\nconsent for your stuff to be searched.\n\n398\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.800\nIf you're a major living there,\nit depends on circumstance, right?\n\n399\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.760\nDo you have a lease?\n\n400\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.560\nDo you have an expectation of privacy?\n\n401\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.080\nWe talked about these kinda things,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n402\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.750\nWe've also mentioned order of\nvolatility when it comes to evidence,\n\n403\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.110\nin at least one other\nepisode we talked about this.\n\n404\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.900\nI said at that point we would\nactually go through and\n\n405\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.230\ndetail out the order of\nvolatility of evidence.\n\n406\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.440\nSo I wanna spend some time\nwith you doing that now.\n\n407\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.900\nWe go from most volatile\nto least volatile.\n\n408\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.800\nSo wanna think about the fact that\nthe most volatile kinds of data\n\n409\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.310\nare going to be dynamic data that is gonna\nsit in memory, registers, and caches and\n\n410\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.570\nthings of that nature.\n\n411\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.250\nIf we can go back to my machine here for\n\n412\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.000\na minute, let's just do a quick\nlittle demonstration of this.\n\n413\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:44.690\nSo in our chat window,\nour command window, right up here.\n\n414\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.931\nIf we take a look at- -as we said, and\n\n415\n00:19:49.931 --> 00:19:56.101\nI've done before, ipconfig /displaydns,\nyou'll see that we have a lot of,\n\n416\n00:19:56.101 --> 00:20:02.230\nnot a huge amount of information, but\na little bit of information in here.\n\n417\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.910\nAs I scroll down, right,\n\n418\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.850\nwe can see that there's a little bit of\ninformation that may or may not exist.\n\n419\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:14.123\nBut if I go in and\nI go out to the web and I-\n\n420\n00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:26.987\n-go to Google Maps, and\njust resolve something on the web,\n\n421\n00:20:26.987 --> 00:20:29.570\ndoesn't really matter what.\n\n422\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.710\nHey, let's go to the Oaks Mall.\n\n423\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.920\nLook at that right there, little point\non there and apparently there is a,\n\n424\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.560\nalligator doing the Macarena in\nthe food court at 2 o'clock today.\n\n425\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.572\nDon't want to miss that,\nthat looks like a lot of fun.\n\n426\n00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:43.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you know whatever it is,\n\n427\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.830\nright, that we may look at.\n\n428\n00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:51.470\nWhen we do this, and we'll just pull up\nsome information, and then we go down and\n\n429\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.260\nwe just out something in here and\nthen let's just bring this up again.\n\n430\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.400\nWe'll see that we now have a lot of\ninformation in the cache, right?\n\n431\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.930\nSo we could see all that.\n\n432\n00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.390\nNow, if I wanted to capture this dynamic,\nthis volatile data,\n\n433\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.510\nbefore it is wiped out,\nI'd have to do this.\n\n434\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.132\nSo we've talked about ways to do this, we\ncould use a forensically sound right back\n\n435\n00:21:11.132 --> 00:21:12.958\nprogram to capture an image to the drive.\n\n436\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.426\nI could do an IP config Display DNS and\n\n437\n00:21:15.426 --> 00:21:19.240\noutput it to a device that\nwas using a right blocker.\n\n438\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.430\nBut if somebody went in and\nissued a command\n\n439\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.880\nthat wiped out this data instead\nof display DNS, we did Flush DNS.\n\n440\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.170\nAnd we did that and\nsuccessfully flushed DNS resolver cache.\n\n441\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.790\nNow when I go back you'll see that\nthere's nothing in the DNS cache.\n\n442\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.870\nI've essentially gotten rid of all that\nvolatile evidence, all that volatile data.\n\n443\n00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.940\nSo in other words everything in\nthe routing table, the process table,\n\n444\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.490\nthe memory, the registers,\nthe caches this is all a volatile data.\n\n445\n00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.400\nIf somebody, a bad actor,\nsomebody such as Daniel,\n\n446\n00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.250\ncuz I would never do this\ncuz I'm a good person.\n\n447\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.680\nBut he would do this, right?\n\n448\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.500\nIf he snuck on to my machine and\ndid this hey,\n\n449\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:06.310\nipconfig flush DNS to hide the fact that\nhe had gone out to a bunch of web sites,\n\n450\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.900\nthis information may not be available.\n\n451\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.930\nNow, do I have a record\nof this information,\n\n452\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.800\nhim going to web sites in another area?\n\n453\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.610\nYeah, wiping it out here doesn't wipe\nit out of the history in the browser\n\n454\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.740\nas we took a look at.\n\n455\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.480\nSo while this information is going\nto come from the same common source.\n\n456\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.860\nThe information in the IP config\ndisplay DNS, the DNS resolver cache,\n\n457\n00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.950\nis not linked directly to the information\nstored in the web browser cache.\n\n458\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.920\nSo if I wiped out one I might\nnecessarily effecting the other.\n\n459\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.140\nSo it's important to understand\norder of volatility.\n\n460\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.340\nImportant for us to understand\nwhere this information lives, and\n\n461\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.930\nhow to gain access to it.\n\n462\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.870\nAnd keep in mind, there's more than one\ntool, more than one mechanism, approach,\n\n463\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.830\ntechnique that we use to\ngather this information.\n\n464\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.240\nBut because of that there's also more\nthan one approach, one technique,\n\n465\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.300\none tool that a bad actor can\nuse to cover their tracks.\n\n466\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.050\nWouldn't be hard for\nme to hack into a box,\n\n467\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:01.050\ngo to a bunch of dark websites that I\ndon't want anybody to see or know about.\n\n468\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:07.300\nAnd then clear the cache in the browser,\nclear the cache in the DNS resolver cache,\n\n469\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.920\nand be able to remove all that\nevidence and make it very tough for\n\n470\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.250\nan investigator to find out\nwhere I went and what I did.\n\n471\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.170\nI mean, it wouldn't be impossible,\nbut it would be tough for\n\n472\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.740\nme to then figure that out, right?\n\n473\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.550\nSo we'd have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n474\n00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.680\nWe could do that with Arc,\nwith the DNS cache,\n\n475\n00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.900\nwith the net BIOS cache, with net stack.\n\n476\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.520\nThere are all these different caches on\nthe machine that are available that I\n\n477\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.340\nwould want to know about and\nI would want to have knowledge of.\n\n478\n00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.080\nSo we have to be aware\nof those kinda things.\n\n479\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.130\nSo registers and\n\n480\n00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.580\ncaches, routing tables, so I demonstrated\na route out and route print for\n\n481\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.340\nyou at some point, process tables, memory,\nall that kinda stuff's gonna be important.\n\n482\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.430\nCan we go back to the machine here for\na minute.\n\n483\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.212\nLet's just take a look at one other\nthing with regards to process tables.\n\n484\n00:23:48.212 --> 00:23:52.964\nSo if we wanna go ahead and\nlook at our task manager,\n\n485\n00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:57.171\nand Windows, this is a Server 2008 box.\n\n486\n00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:01.213\nSo if we go in and we take a look, we can\nsee the applications that are running.\n\n487\n00:24:01.213 --> 00:24:06.372\nWe could see processes that are running,\nwe can see services that are running,\n\n488\n00:24:06.372 --> 00:24:09.686\nget a little performance data,\nthings like that.\n\n489\n00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:13.927\nIs there a way for us to be able to get a\nlist of all the processes that are running\n\n490\n00:24:13.927 --> 00:24:14.985\nfrom that system?\n\n491\n00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:17.974\nIn other words, can we take the\ninformation that shows up in task manager,\n\n492\n00:24:17.974 --> 00:24:19.580\nexport that, and capture that?\n\n493\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.350\nThe answer is absolutely,\nthere's lots of ways to do that.\n\n494\n00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:27.439\nWe can go in and we can use a tool\nlike Top, or Proc, or List.\n\n495\n00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:29.838\nIn the Linux/Unix world it would be top or\nproc or list.\n\n496\n00:24:29.838 --> 00:24:34.176\nThat would be a command line version\nof what the Windows Task Manager does.\n\n497\n00:24:34.176 --> 00:24:39.014\nThere's a set of tools from Sysinternals\non the Windows Microsoft TechNet\n\n498\n00:24:39.014 --> 00:24:40.481\nsite that you can use.\n\n499\n00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:44.080\nPsList, which is a tool that will\nessentially list, and acts like top or\n\n500\n00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.510\nproc or list in the Windows world,\nlist all the processes for us.\n\n501\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.210\nAnd we could output that list and\nactually see what's running in memory and\n\n502\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.050\nhave a listing,\nan output of all the volatile processes.\n\n503\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.460\nSo we could use a list or a tool\nlike that to be able to derive that.\n\n504\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.540\nI mean, could I bring this up,\ntake a picture of it, scroll down,\n\n505\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.320\ntake a picture of the next ten or twenty?\n\n506\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.030\nYeah, I could do that as well,\nright, it would just depend.\n\n507\n00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:11.230\nIf we take a look at Windows 10 for just a\nminute and we go into the task manager and\n\n508\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:16.680\nso we take a look here and\nwe go in and there it is right there.\n\n509\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.380\nAnd we take a look our task manager.\n\n510\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.880\nTask manager's a little\nbit different here, right?\n\n511\n00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.650\nIt's just that different look and feel.\n\n512\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.770\nWe open up more views or\nmore details and again we see the list,\n\n513\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.930\nwe see it broken down by apps, by process.\n\n514\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.320\nA little bit easier to see.\n\n515\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.090\nWe go into performance,\ngo to app history, so\n\n516\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.930\nwe could see the history which is\nkinda nice, see what's been running.\n\n517\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.490\nSo we could take a look at all that.\n\n518\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.900\nWe could look at details, which is what\nwe're used to seeing as the traditional\n\n519\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.440\nprocess u in the older\nversion of Task Manager.\n\n520\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.570\nSo we can come in here, we could see this.\n\n521\n00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.230\nAnd you'll see we have File,\nwe have Options, we have View, but\n\n522\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.020\nyou'll notice there's nowhere to export.\n\n523\n00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.390\nAgain, it's kind of static.\n\n524\n00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.760\nIt's dynamic data but\nit's in there in a way that's static.\n\n525\n00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.445\nWe can't pull it out even though\nit's updated dynamically.\n\n526\n00:25:57.445 --> 00:25:58.485\nBut could we get it?\n\n527\n00:25:58.485 --> 00:26:01.077\nYeah, again, we could take\na picture of what's on the screen,\n\n528\n00:26:01.077 --> 00:26:02.705\nwe could use a tool like PS List here.\n\n529\n00:26:02.705 --> 00:26:05.065\nThere's a lot of ways to pull\nthis data out of the system.\n\n530\n00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:08.495\nSo we just wanna be aware of that and\nthink about that, have a sense that.\n\n531\n00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:12.935\nBecause again based on operating system\ntype, we may be able to get certain\n\n532\n00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:16.945\ninformation or use certain kinds of data\nto see what's there, certain tools to see\n\n533\n00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:19.855\nwhat's there, and it may vary a little\nbit but it also may be very similar.\n\n534\n00:26:19.855 --> 00:26:20.913\nDepending on what we're doing.\n\n535\n00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:23.779\nSo we've got routing tables,\nprocess tables, memory.\n\n536\n00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:27.980\nTemp file system, number three or the\nthird spot there on a temp file system.\n\n537\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.860\nSo we wanna look at what's in\nthe temporary storage areas.\n\n538\n00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:36.672\nThings like the paging file or swap files,\nright, we wanna be aware of those.\n\n539\n00:26:36.672 --> 00:26:37.920\nDisk or storage medium,\n\n540\n00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.850\nso what on the drive, area or item\nnumber four in the order of volatility.\n\n541\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.620\nItem number five,\nremote logging and monitoring data.\n\n542\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.270\nItem number six, configurations and\n\n543\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.500\ntopologies, it's how's the machine\nconfigured, how's it networked,\n\n544\n00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.150\nwhat's it connected to, wirelessly,\nwhatever it is, wired or wireless.\n\n545\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.410\nAnd then archival media,\nitem number seven.\n\n546\n00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.985\nIn that order of volatility,\nfrom most volatile to least volatile.\n\n547\n00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:03.850\nWanna make sure we have a sense\nof the order of volatility.\n\n548\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.290\nVery important you may wanna know that.\n\n549\n00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.010\nMay come up at some point.\n\n550\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.310\nMay get asked about that.\n\n551\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.090\nIf you're gonna plan on sitting for\nthis kind of an exams.\n\n552\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.430\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n553\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.060\nWhat does it mean when we\nhave malware in the system?\n\n554\n00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.260\nDaniel had mentioned malware a while back.\n\n555\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.080\nWith regards to maybe leaving\nit behind as a surprise, right?\n\n556\n00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.100\nFor somebody like an investigator.\n\n557\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.130\nRemember M=malware can change the way\na system behaves, it can modify files,\n\n558\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.880\nit can delete files, it can rename,\nit could do all sorts of stuff.\n\n559\n00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.640\nIt's the prototypical classic\nrubric that the investigator\n\n560\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.790\nneeds to operate within when we deal with\nmalware because malware really modifies\n\n561\n00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.780\nwhat is normally traditionally seen\nas the baseline of the system.\n\n562\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.827\nAnd we have to unravel that and\nexamine that and\n\n563\n00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:47.361\nunderstand that activity to better\nunderstand what the malware may have done.\n\n564\n00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:50.615\nAnd so, that's gonna be very important for\nus to do, and the skills, and\n\n565\n00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:53.556\nthe techniques necessary to do that\nare gonna be important for us,\n\n566\n00:27:53.556 --> 00:27:55.205\nas investigators, to have as well.\n\n567\n00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:57.399\nA little bit out beyond the scope\nof what we're talking about here.\n\n568\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.068\nWhole separate set of skills you\nhave to get trained in specific\n\n569\n00:28:01.068 --> 00:28:02.933\nto understanding how to work with malware.\n\n570\n00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:06.387\nBut a forensic investigator would\ncertainly wanna understand the effects\n\n571\n00:28:06.387 --> 00:28:10.056\nof malware, look for the telltale signs,\nand at least have enough knowledge to\n\n572\n00:28:10.056 --> 00:28:13.341\nunderstand that they may have to call\nin an expert to help them debunk and\n\n573\n00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:15.990\nessentially identify what\nthe malware has done.\n\n574\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.061\nBut it's often gonna remap system\nvariables, it's gonna remove files,\n\n575\n00:28:20.061 --> 00:28:21.755\nit's gonna change behavior.\n\n576\n00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:25.703\nThese are all things we would have\nto be aware of as an investigator.\n\n577\n00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:29.030\nInteresting little aside with regards\nto what we're talking about here.\n\n578\n00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.891\nSo one of the things you have to\nknow about as well, and I've tried\n\n579\n00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:35.435\nto demonstrate some different applications\nin different operating systems for\n\n580\n00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:38.788\nyou, giving you a sense of how things\nmay work across different platforms.\n\n581\n00:28:38.788 --> 00:28:40.860\nOne of the things we have to\nknow how to do is to safely and\n\n582\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.260\nsecurely shut down an operating system,\nbelieve it or not, as an investigator.\n\n583\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.740\nWe can't just walk up, find the machine\ndo our stuff and then say, okay,\n\n584\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.660\nhow do I turn this thing off?\n\n585\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.020\nLet me pull the plug and crash.\n\n586\n00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.170\nI mean, that's not gonna be appropriate.\n\n587\n00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.480\nSo how do you shut down a Windows system?\n\n588\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.610\nMost of us probably know how to\ndo that I would think, right?\n\n589\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.800\nYou can go into the Start menu or\nthe equivalent of the Start Menu,\n\n590\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.960\nwhatever it may be.\n\n591\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.160\nYou can look for a Start up shutdown,\na power icon things like that.\n\n592\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.470\nAnd we could go ahead and issue a command\nfor us to shut down the system.\n\n593\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.490\nCan you shut down a Windows\nsystem from the command line?\n\n594\n00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.079\n&gt;&gt; You sure can.\n\n595\n00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:13.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nyou can use shut down command, right?\n\n596\n00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.560\nSo you could do that as well.\n\n597\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.137\nHow about Linux and Unix systems?\n\n598\n00:29:16.137 --> 00:29:17.719\nHow do we shut those down, right?\n\n599\n00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:20.177\nAgain, concept is similar, right?\n\n600\n00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:23.578\nThey do have a shutdown command after all,\nbut it's probably almost with out\n\n601\n00:29:23.578 --> 00:29:27.580\nexception, gonna be a command line option,\nas opposed to a graphical interface.\n\n602\n00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.700\nThere are Linux distributions today\nthat are graphical interfaces right?\n\n603\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.667\nWe've been able to use X Windows for\nsome time and things like that but\n\n604\n00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:36.955\nthe reality is in Unix there really is\nnot typically a graphical interface.\n\n605\n00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:39.570\nIt's more often than not a command line.\n\n606\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.980\nWe may go in and either right-click\na menu and click console and\n\n607\n00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.565\nopen up a console window or some sort\nof console will already be open to us.\n\n608\n00:29:47.565 --> 00:29:50.810\nIf the root user's prompt\nis set to sign-in mode or\n\n609\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.170\nto set the sign-in hash sign\nmode is what I'm trying to say\n\n610\n00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.000\nwe can enter the password that\nwill allow us to halt the system.\n\n611\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.310\nSo if we know the root\npassword we can do that.\n\n612\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:06.170\nIf it's set to the console sign mode as\nopposed to the other kind of mode we may\n\n613\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.730\nhave to go in and enter the user's ID that\nhas a right to shut down the system first.\n\n614\n00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.580\nSo it depends on how we're logged in.\n\n615\n00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.860\nIf we're a normal user, not a super user,\nnot root user, we may not have rights to\n\n616\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.970\nshut down that system and\nit may be hard for us to do that\n\n617\n00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.250\nunless we can either change the log on by\nproviding essentially pseudonym, right?\n\n618\n00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:26.320\nProviding a super user credential auth or\n\n619\n00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.350\nwe may have to shut the system\ndown by forcing a power off.\n\n620\n00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.220\nBy essentially pulling the plug as\nwe may not have the rights to do so.\n\n621\n00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.940\nSo it's a question of what's\nthe mechanism available to us?\n\n622\n00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.410\nIn Linux/Unix,\nwe make that differentiation.\n\n623\n00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.350\nIn Windows, you may be logged on as a user\nwith constrained rights that may not\n\n624\n00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.270\nbe able to power off a system either.\n\n625\n00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.490\nRight, we often will do that in\nterminal environments where we give you\n\n626\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.465\na restricted logon.\n\n627\n00:30:47.465 --> 00:30:51.690\nYou log on as a normal\nuser that's constrained.\n\n628\n00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.100\nYou can probably disconnect the session\nbut you can't shut off the machine.\n\n629\n00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.350\nWe do this in our lab environments like\nin your VM or in stuff all the time so\n\n630\n00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.970\nyou can't reset the system and\nblow up the lab.\n\n631\n00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.190\nSo if that's the case you have\nto know how to deal with that.\n\n632\n00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.550\nThat's something else to consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n633\n00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.070\nIt's not as obvious sometimes as it could\nbe cuz a lot of us are used to working in\n\n634\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.100\none environment not necessarily\nall those environments.\n\n635\n00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.590\nJust to wrap up a couple of quick things,\n\n636\n00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.350\nwhat should go on the front\nof an evidence bag?\n\n637\n00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.930\nWe often talk about gathering evidence but\n\n638\n00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.740\nwhat are the things that should\noften be on the front of that?\n\n639\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.320\nI talked a bit about this in\nanother prior episode as well.\n\n640\n00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.005\nBut typically what's commonly there,\nyou'll have typically five things.\n\n641\n00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:28.750\nDate and time of seizure.\n\n642\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.954\nSo we have to date and\ntime stamp what's there.\n\n643\n00:31:30.954 --> 00:31:32.780\nAgain, it is written out.\n\n644\n00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.800\nWho is the person who sees the evidence?\n\n645\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.090\nSo, who essentially found it.\n\n646\n00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.290\nYou have to write down your name,\nand usually sign it, right?\n\n647\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:39.930\nExhibit number.\n\n648\n00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.420\nYou need a tracking number of\nsome kind for the evidence.\n\n649\n00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:43.625\nWhere was it seized from?\n\n650\n00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:47.275\nSo, where inside the crime scene and\nwhat location, so we know.\n\n651\n00:31:47.275 --> 00:31:49.562\nAnd then the details of\nwhat's actually in the bag.\n\n652\n00:31:49.562 --> 00:31:53.005\nYou don't just put a thumbdrive in\nthere and then not write anything down.\n\n653\n00:31:53.005 --> 00:31:55.602\nYou have to put a thumbdrive in there and\nsay, USB drive found on\n\n654\n00:31:55.602 --> 00:31:58.208\nthis machine or something like that-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That way if it makes its\n\n655\n00:31:58.208 --> 00:31:59.614\nway out of that bag,\n[INAUDIBLE] They can say,\n\n656\n00:31:59.614 --> 00:32:02.254\nwell there was a thumb drive in here\nbecause that's what's written on the.\n\n657\n00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:05.436\n&gt;&gt; Right, in other words we know what to\nlook for if it's not in the bag, exactly.\n\n658\n00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:08.400\nCuz if you don't have any description\nin there, we know there was something,\n\n659\n00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.349\nwe don't know what it is.\n\n660\n00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:10.415\n&gt;&gt; Just not what it was.\n\n661\n00:32:10.415 --> 00:32:13.733\n&gt;&gt; Unless somebody left a note behind\nthat said, I took the thumb drive,\n\n662\n00:32:13.733 --> 00:32:15.150\nI'll bring it back, right.\n\n663\n00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.771\nI mean we just don't know, so we have to\nmake sure that we have a description,\n\n664\n00:32:18.771 --> 00:32:21.473\nright, of the item as crazy as\nthat sounds a lot of times.\n\n665\n00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:24.722\nWhat I've seen some people do is\nthey'll take digital photographs,\n\n666\n00:32:24.722 --> 00:32:26.769\nwhether it's a normal camera or whatever.\n\n667\n00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:30.596\nThey'll take a photograph of the item and\nthey'll photograph the evidence bag.\n\n668\n00:32:30.596 --> 00:32:33.683\nAnd then they'll actually,\naside from the description and everything,\n\n669\n00:32:33.683 --> 00:32:35.447\nthey'll actually have the photograph and\n\n670\n00:32:35.447 --> 00:32:38.498\nthey'll put the photograph on the outside\nto represent the item as well.\n\n671\n00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:41.548\nSo that way we know we have the\npictographic record of what was in there\n\n672\n00:32:41.548 --> 00:32:42.821\nas well as the description.\n\n673\n00:32:42.821 --> 00:32:45.215\n&gt;&gt; Giving you as much detail as possible.\n\n674\n00:32:45.215 --> 00:32:46.168\n&gt;&gt; Essentially.\n\n675\n00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:49.022\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if I had two evidence in bags and\nthey both have thumb drives in them.\n\n676\n00:32:49.022 --> 00:32:51.221\nThis one was a yellow\nKingston thumb drive.\n\n677\n00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:54.158\nThis was a black Corsair.\n\n678\n00:32:54.158 --> 00:32:56.114\nThat if they just both\njust said thumb drive,\n\n679\n00:32:56.114 --> 00:32:56.772\nyou-\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't know.\n\n680\n00:32:56.772 --> 00:32:58.568\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't know which is which and\n\n681\n00:32:58.568 --> 00:33:00.916\nyou may inadvertently put the wrong\nitem back in the wrong bag-\n\n682\n00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:01.568\n&gt;&gt; Which could change evidence\n\n683\n00:33:01.568 --> 00:33:02.135\n&gt;&gt; Giving it the wrong ID.\n\n684\n00:33:02.135 --> 00:33:03.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which would actually screw everything\n\n685\n00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:06.281\nup cuz it would have the wrong evidence\ntracking number at that point.\n\n686\n00:33:06.281 --> 00:33:07.953\nThe last thing to talk about here,\nquickly.\n\n687\n00:33:07.953 --> 00:33:10.552\nWhat are common mistakes that\nare committed by first responders?\n\n688\n00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:13.910\nSo we've talked about what first\nresponders have to be comfortable doing,\n\n689\n00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.490\nhow to do it.\n\n690\n00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.438\nShowing you some stuff.\n\n691\n00:33:15.438 --> 00:33:16.911\nBut what are mistakes we can make?\n\n692\n00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:20.105\nBiggest mistake we can make is shutting\ndown the target machine that we're\n\n693\n00:33:20.105 --> 00:33:22.347\ninvestigating before we\ncapture all the evidence.\n\n694\n00:33:22.347 --> 00:33:25.822\nRight so, if the first responder\ncomes in powers off the machine,\n\n695\n00:33:25.822 --> 00:33:28.813\nall of that volatile data\ndisappears that's a problem.\n\n696\n00:33:28.813 --> 00:33:32.655\nAssuming that some components of\nthe victim's computer maybe reliable and\n\n697\n00:33:32.655 --> 00:33:35.065\nusable when that's not\nnecessarily the case.\n\n698\n00:33:35.065 --> 00:33:37.308\nWe should never do anything\non the victim's machine.\n\n699\n00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:39.815\nWe don't sit down and say hey,\nI gotta check my email real quick.\n\n700\n00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:42.682\nLet me go do that while\nI'm here investigating.\n\n701\n00:33:42.682 --> 00:33:45.079\nBad idea, right, we don't wanna do that.\n\n702\n00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:49.022\nNot having access to the baseline\ndocumentation about the victim's computer.\n\n703\n00:33:49.022 --> 00:33:51.478\nWe don't understand the make,\nthe model, the build, all that.\n\n704\n00:33:51.478 --> 00:33:52.443\nThat can be a problem.\n\n705\n00:33:52.443 --> 00:33:55.383\nAnd also really important,\nprobably most importantly,\n\n706\n00:33:55.383 --> 00:33:59.533\nJust as important as not shutting down\nthe machine before we gather the evidence.\n\n707\n00:33:59.533 --> 00:34:01.783\nNot documenting the data\ncollection process.\n\n708\n00:34:01.783 --> 00:34:04.907\nAlso a huge, huge problem for\nus if that happens.\n\n709\n00:34:04.907 --> 00:34:06.611\nSo, want to make sure we know.\n\n710\n00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.027\nCommon mistakes that\nfirst responders make.\n\n711\n00:34:09.027 --> 00:34:11.878\nIf you're gonna be thinking about\ntaking the exam at some point.\n\n712\n00:34:11.878 --> 00:34:15.223\nYou may get asked, hey, what are common\nmistakes first responders may make.\n\n713\n00:34:15.223 --> 00:34:17.827\nYou wanna know things like\nnot documenting fully, and\n\n714\n00:34:17.827 --> 00:34:21.733\nnot being able to understand the capture\nof volatile evidence before the system is\n\n715\n00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:25.201\npowered down are crucial mistakes that\nwe can make as a first responder.\n\n716\n00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:29.183\n&gt;&gt; Obviously being a first responder is a\nvery important job If you are in that role\n\n717\n00:34:29.183 --> 00:34:31.852\nyou need to know what is this\nthat is expected of you.\n\n718\n00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:36.298\nYou need to know some of the procedures\nthat you might be tasked to perform and\n\n719\n00:34:36.298 --> 00:34:39.285\nalso some of the pitfalls\nthat you might fall into so\n\n720\n00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:41.316\nthat you might avoid them as well.\n\n721\n00:34:41.316 --> 00:34:45.860\nThat been said [LAUGH] Mr Adam we are\ndefinitely gone well over the time limit\n\n722\n00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.456\non this.\n\n723\n00:34:46.456 --> 00:34:49.956\nBut for very good reason because this is\nextremely important information for you if\n\n724\n00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:53.410\nyou are in that first responder role,\nwe don't wanna leave anything out for you.\n\n725\n00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.421\nSo it was time well spent.\n\n726\n00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:57.936\nWith that being said,\nwe have exhausted this episode.\n\n727\n00:34:57.936 --> 00:34:59.541\nThank you guys so much for watching.\n\n728\n00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:01.023\nThank you, Adam, for joining us.\n\n729\n00:35:01.023 --> 00:35:04.558\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n730\n00:35:04.558 --> 00:35:05.639\n&gt;&gt; I'm outta here.\n\n731\n00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:07.927\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n732\n00:35:07.927 --> 00:35:13.896\n[MUSIC]\n\n733\n00:35:13.896 --> 00:35:17.250\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

--> 00:00:13.233\nwatching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.631\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:20.846\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode it's more on CHFI.\n\n6\n00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.594\nAnd the minty glow that you might\nsee emanating from the side of\n\n7\n00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:29.588\nme over here is our good friend back to\nhelp us in this endeavor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:30.899\nAdam, how's it going today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, my arm is not long enough.\n\n10\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.560\nI had to reach almost\nall the way over there.\n\n11\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.381\n&gt;&gt; It's a long table.\n\n12\n00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:38.128\nIt is, you don't realized how long\ntill you have to reach across it.\n\n13\n00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:41.540\nI'm doing well,\nhopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n14\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.690\nWe're gonna talk a little bit about\nhow to set up a forensics lab.\n\n15\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.770\nWe've been talking a lot about what to\ndo in the field as a first responder.\n\n16\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.397\nWhat the mechanisms,\nmethodologies, concerns, and\n\n17\n00:00:52.397 --> 00:00:54.644\nitems of interest are to the CHFI.\n\n18\n00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:57.892\nBut we haven't really talked about what\nhappens on the back end when you bring all\n\n19\n00:00:57.892 --> 00:00:59.133\nthat stuff in from the field and\n\n20\n00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.874\npush it all through the door to\nsecurely store it and we put it there.\n\n21\n00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.190\nWe haven't really talked about what that\nenvironment looks like up until now.\n\n22\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.818\nSo we thought it would be a good idea for\nus to spend a little time just talking\n\n23\n00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.712\nabout how you set the lab up,\nwhat you gonna do there.\n\n24\n00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.295\nAnd some of the cool stuff that you may\nactually wanna take a look at online\n\n25\n00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.644\nthat'll help you to find the tools,\ntoys, and\n\n26\n00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:19.086\nthings that may be on your wish list for\nthe upcoming holiday season.\n\n27\n00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:20.900\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.680\nSo, let's start by talking about\nwhat a computer forensics lab is.\n\n29\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.515\nA computer forensics lab is going to be\nthat designated location where we go to\n\n30\n00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:32.115\nconduct the computer based investigations\nthat need to take place on all\n\n31\n00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:33.424\nthe collected evidence.\n\n32\n00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:37.590\nIn other words, it's the place where\nwe can climate control, humidity,\n\n33\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.843\nexposure to static electricity,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:44.746\nIt's gonna be where we can safely,\nsecurely, and cleanly examine and\n\n35\n00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:46.350\nwork with the evidence.\n\n36\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.320\nAnd do so in a way that doesn't gonna\ndamage it or anyway comprise it.\n\n37\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.010\nSometimes referred to as a clean room,\n\n38\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.610\nsometimes referred to as\nan evidence investigation area.\n\n39\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630\nGenerically, we just simply call\nit computer forensics laboratory.\n\n40\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.090\nSo how do you set it up, what do you do?\n\n41\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.731\nIn other words, can I go to the back of\nthe room here at the little table and\n\n42\n00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:08.824\ncan I say that's gonna be my CFL, my\ncomputer forensics laboratory workspace?\n\n43\n00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:12.743\nI mean, I could, but that's probably not\nreally gonna be very efficient for me, and\n\n44\n00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:14.660\nit's probably not gonna work very well.\n\n45\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.705\nSo are there standards,\nare there things we should be aware of?\n\n46\n00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.695\nAre there concerns we\nwould need to address?\n\n47\n00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:25.185\nWe often break this down into a six step\nprocess and say, the things involved\n\n48\n00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:28.515\nwith setting up the lab are gonna be\nin areas like planning and budgeting.\n\n49\n00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.170\nGotta do a lot of pre-work to figure\nout what has to go into the laboratory.\n\n50\n00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.685\nGotta put out a budget to be\nable to do that and see that.\n\n51\n00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:38.020\nWe've gotta figure out locations and\ndesign.\n\n52\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.100\nGotta understand what we wanna build,\n\n53\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.971\nwhere we're gonna build it,\nand to what end.\n\n54\n00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.010\nIn other words, have all the tools,\nthe technology,\n\n55\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.010\nthe resources, the power necessary\nto drive them, things like that.\n\n56\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.270\nGotta have a secure work area,\nso that's gonna be number three.\n\n57\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.409\nGotta worry about licensing\nof the laboratory,\n\n58\n00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.170\nwe'll talk about international\nlicensing standards.\n\n59\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.940\nGotta worry about HR related concerns and\nactivities.\n\n60\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.370\nSo, how are we gonna hire people,\nwhat do the background checks look like,\n\n61\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.400\nstuff like that.\n\n62\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.265\nAnd number six, physical security.\n\n63\n00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:10.480\nGotta worry about making sure\nthat this environment is gonna be\n\n64\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.860\nfirewalled off physically and logically.\n\n65\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120\nWe have access control, people can't\njust walk in, interact with our stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.720\nData's gonna be locked up and\nstored securely, that kinda stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.348\nA lot of times, these laboratories\nare in law enforcement agencies.\n\n68\n00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:27.107\nSo they're gonna be behind\na security perimeter to begin with.\n\n69\n00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.580\nThey're gonna be maintained and secured.\n\n70\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.443\nBut sometimes they're freestanding\nbuildings that have nothing to do with law\n\n71\n00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:33.004\nenforcement.\n\n72\n00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.198\n&gt;&gt; And the placing of your punji\npits are very important [LAUGH].\n\n73\n00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:39.881\n&gt;&gt; Yes they are, so making sure\nthat people can fall into them, and\n\n74\n00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.980\nalso not only that, but\nsharpening them is also equally important.\n\n75\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.710\nPunji sticks have to be sharp,\nyou don't want dull punji sticks.\n\n76\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.760\nThat leads to pissed off intruders and\nnobody's happy.\n\n77\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.190\nIf they can't complain because they're\ntoo busy screaming, then nobody cares.\n\n78\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.310\nSo, that's also very important.\n\n79\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.390\nYou are a devious,\ndevious person this morning, Mr. Daniel.\n\n80\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.760\nSo we do wanna think about all that.\n\n81\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.255\nSo what does planning look like?\n\n82\n00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.180\nPlanning's probably one of the most\nimportant things we can do\n\n83\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.280\nin any endeavor.\n\n84\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.280\nWe often talk about planning to be\nsuccessful or planning to fail.\n\n85\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.590\nAnd we have the plan to be successful.\n\n86\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.070\nSo things like what types of\ninvestigations are gonna be conducted.\n\n87\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.220\nWhat kind of material are we\ngonna be looking at here?\n\n88\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.600\nDo we need a huge garage-like bay because\nwe're gonna forensically examine cars,\n\n89\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.680\npotentially?\n\n90\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.100\nLaw enforcement agencies do\na lot of criminalistic work.\n\n91\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.151\nSo they're dealing with drug busts,\n\n92\n00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.220\nthey're dealing with people\nshooting each other.\n\n93\n00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.110\nPeople having car accidents that\nunfortunately kill people, and so\n\n94\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.530\nvehicles being used in\nthe commission of a crime.\n\n95\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.090\nSo they're gonna have to examine vehicles.\n\n96\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.515\nThey have to have a huge working space and\na bay to that.\n\n97\n00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.555\nThey may need a mechanics\nshop essentially,\n\n98\n00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:48.035\na lift to be able to bring\nthe car up off the ground.\n\n99\n00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:51.355\nThey're gonna need tools to take\nthe car apart, that kind of stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:52.907\nThat's very different than hey,\n\n101\n00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:55.970\nI got a couple of computers I gotta\nthrow up on the desk and work with.\n\n102\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.450\nSo depending on the kind of\ninvestigations that are gonna take place,\n\n103\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.570\nwe may need a very, very different setup.\n\n104\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.678\nIf we're dealing with human forensics,\nessentially autopsies and\n\n105\n00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:08.934\ngathering DNA samples and\nblood and things like that,\n\n106\n00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:13.710\nthen we're gonna need a very different\nsetup than if we're dealing with cars.\n\n107\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.323\nWe're gonna have to be,\nyou remember Quincy?\n\n108\n00:05:15.323 --> 00:05:17.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna have to be like the Quincy,\n\n109\n00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.717\nMD show,\nwhere we essentially have the morgue and\n\n110\n00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:21.519\nwe have to have the examination tables.\n\n111\n00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.597\nOr NCIS, you have to be like Ducky,\nhave your little examination table and\n\n112\n00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:26.850\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.890\nSo we're gonna need all of that.\n\n114\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.220\nYou need the special lights, you need\nthe cold room to store the bodies.\n\n115\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.010\nYou need medical equipment to be able to\ndraw blood and to do all that kinda stuff.\n\n116\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.550\nVery different than what\nwe would be doing, again,\n\n117\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.620\nif we're working with computers.\n\n118\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.236\nSo, we obviously are focussed on\nthe digital aspects of forensics here.\n\n119\n00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:44.920\nBut the reality is,\n\n120\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.030\nas I keep reminding you, forensics is\na very broad category, very broad science.\n\n121\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.700\nAnd there's many, many different\ntypes that are carried out, so\n\n122\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.708\nwe have to plan for that.\n\n123\n00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:55.266\nWhat kind of reference materials\ndo we need to do our work?\n\n124\n00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:58.776\nA lot of it's online today, but\nyears ago, you'd build the library,\n\n125\n00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:01.775\nyou'd actually buy books and\nput them on the shelf.\n\n126\n00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:04.035\nWhat kind of workstations\ndo we need to have?\n\n127\n00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:06.475\nAre we gonna need some\nsort of special computers?\n\n128\n00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:12.230\nDo we need a cyclotron,\ndo we need a blood gas analyzer?\n\n129\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.662\nDo we need a, whatever those tools are\nthat mechanics use to be able to look at\n\n130\n00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:17.410\nthe engine and figure out what's going on\nwith it, I don't know what they call them.\n\n131\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.693\nYou know, the computerized diagnostic\nequipment that mechanics have these days.\n\n132\n00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:22.673\nAgain, depending on\nthe kind of work we do,\n\n133\n00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:24.610\nwe may need a variety of different things.\n\n134\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.370\nWe need a safe locker, some sort of\nsecure location to store evidence.\n\n135\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.550\nWe gotta plan for that, think about that.\n\n136\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.965\nWe need backup power generators, UPSs,\n\n137\n00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:37.489\nas a preventative protection\nagainst power going offline.\n\n138\n00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:41.796\nGotta have Internet connectivity, so\nLAN and WAN connectivity, wired and or\n\n139\n00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:42.455\nwireless.\n\n140\n00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:43.965\nGotta have, obviously,\n\n141\n00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:47.822\nthe appropriate encryption on that\nto be able to protect the data.\n\n142\n00:06:47.822 --> 00:06:49.738\nAny software and\nhardware that may be required.\n\n143\n00:06:49.738 --> 00:06:52.230\nGotta have storage shelves\nto put stuff up on.\n\n144\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.130\nGotta have just all sorts of things that\nwill go into the planning of a space.\n\n145\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.580\nIt's very, very difficult just to sit\ndown and think through an entire list.\n\n146\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.280\nAnd we have checklists for a lot of\nthese things so you don't miss anything.\n\n147\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.234\nGotta figure out the number of examiners\nthat are gonna be working at any one time.\n\n148\n00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:10.345\nHave enough physical space and\ndesks and setups for them.\n\n149\n00:07:10.345 --> 00:07:14.187\nEnough power coming in to be able to power\nall the workstations, things like that,\n\n150\n00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:15.395\nvery important.\n\n151\n00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:17.870\nDon't want people fighting\nover the last network cable,\n\n152\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.760\ntrying to figure out how they're\ngonna get on, that kind of stuff.\n\n153\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.701\nLicensing, how are we gonna\nlicense our facility.\n\n154\n00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:27.342\nThe American Society for Crime Laboratory\nDirectors, what's called ASCLD,\n\n155\n00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:31.370\nis the international body that\ncertifies forensics laboratories.\n\n156\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.700\nAnd you would need to obviously follow\ntheir lead and go to their website.\n\n157\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.362\nFigure out what the standards are you\nwould like to adhere to if you wanna get\n\n158\n00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:42.200\nlicensed as a forensics laboratory.\n\n159\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.011\nForensic labs around the globe\nadhere to the ASCLD standard.\n\n160\n00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:51.140\nBut the ASCLD standard is actually\nbuilt on an ISO standard.\n\n161\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.450\nIf we can go to my machine for\njust a minute.\n\n162\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.373\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nif I can get my mouse to work,\n\n163\n00:07:57.373 --> 00:08:00.614\nwe're gonna take a look at ISO 17025.\n\n164\n00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.686\nIf we could go full screen so\nwe could see that.\n\n165\n00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:05.785\nThese are the general requirements for\nthe competence of testing and\n\n166\n00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.719\ncalibration of forensics laboratories.\n\n167\n00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:10.043\nLast updated in 2005.\n\n168\n00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:13.170\nSo you can see they're just over\na decade old at this point.\n\n169\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.380\nBut, you know, it's important to know\nthat there are international standards\n\n170\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.460\nthat are used to reference this.\n\n171\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.980\nAnd so ISO 17025 would be\nthe international ISO standard\n\n172\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.280\nthat is used by the AFCLD to kind of\ndrive their certification process.\n\n173\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.070\nAll I did was go out and Google ISO 17025.\n\n174\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:37.420\nThird or fourth link down was a link to\nthe PDF that you could pull up and see.\n\n175\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.270\nThis one happens to be free.\n\n176\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.670\nA lot of the ISO stems you\nnormally have to pay for, so\n\n177\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.440\nthis one you can actually find for free.\n\n178\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.700\nSo if you're interested in looking at it,\nyou can go ahead and read through that.\n\n179\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.640\nIt's actually not too\n&gt;&gt; Long.\n\n180\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.100\n&gt;&gt; Not too long,\nas you can see if I scroll down there.\n\n181\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.870\nWhoops.\n\n182\n00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.750\nYou see it's got about 25,\n27 pages, not real long at all.\n\n183\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.710\nBut it talks about things like test\nreports and calibration, going in and\n\n184\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.490\nhandling validation methods,\nlaboratory methods, sampling methods,\n\n185\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.750\nmeasurement, traceability,\nspecific requirements.\n\n186\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.310\nAll the stuff you would need to know\ntechnically, with regards to lab work,\n\n187\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.120\nto be able to set that environment up,\nright?\n\n188\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.270\nSo, that would be one of\nthe things to look at.\n\n189\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.850\nIf you wanna go out and look for\nthe ASCLD, you can actually go out to\n\n190\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.380\nGoogle and do this, but it would be\neasy enough to go do in real time.\n\n191\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.150\nJust go out to ASCLD, and\nif you just take a look American Society\n\n192\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.330\nof Crime Lab Directors, so ascld.org,\nyou can go out, go to their website.\n\n193\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.850\nCome up here in just a minute.\n\n194\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.500\nAnd you can actually read through\nthe logic of what happens.\n\n195\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.400\nWhat the process looks like.\n\n196\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.940\nYou can go in and\ntake a look at, training.\n\n197\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.330\nThey have information.\n\n198\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.410\nYou can find out about them.\n\n199\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.440\nAnd you could find out about what\nthe process is to get certified,\n\n200\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.820\nall that kind of stuff as the lab\nwould be available to you there.\n\n201\n00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.580\nEncourage you to go out and take a look\nat the site, probably be valuable for\n\n202\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.710\nyou, as a potential CHFI, to at least be\naware of the fact that there are these\n\n203\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.270\ngroups out there that exist\nthat you'd want to reference.\n\n204\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.980\nIt would probably be good for\nyou to take a look at that at some point.\n\n205\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.210\nSo you can go out and\nsee that on your own.\n\n206\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.770\nWhat do you need to do\nwith regards to imaging?\n\n207\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.210\nMaking drive copies, and how we do so\nforensically soundly is pretty important.\n\n208\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.660\nWe talk a lot about that in\nprior episodes and shows.\n\n209\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.320\nUnderstanding how to do that, and\n\n210\n00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.210\nhow that would work,\nwould also be important for you.\n\n211\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.780\nSo if we could go back to my machine here,\nand\n\n212\n00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.501\nyou could see that among the many websites\nwe can go to, and there are thousands,\n\n213\n00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:36.469\nthousands of sites that will have\ninformation about how to do this.\n\n214\n00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.471\nAnd there are many companies\nthat will sell information and\n\n215\n00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:41.412\nproducts about how to do this as well.\n\n216\n00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:42.760\nLogicube is one of them.\n\n217\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.800\nLet me be clear, not endorsing\nany company by bringing up one or\n\n218\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.350\nmore of them in an episode like this,\nsaying this one is better than others.\n\n219\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.620\nJust happens to be the one that\nI picked when I went out and\n\n220\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.900\njust quickly did a Google search.\n\n221\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.450\nOr maybe a company that I\nhave used equipment from in\n\n222\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.260\nthe past that I'm familiar with,\nthat I'm comfortable just talking about,\n\n223\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.170\nbecause I know there stuff is good.\n\n224\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.640\nBut in no way does it imply\nan endorsement, in no way does it imply\n\n225\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.350\nthat this company is better than others,\nit's just a company.\n\n226\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.560\nThat's all it is, right?\n\n227\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.470\nSo Logicube, hard drive duplication and\nforensic imaging solutions.\n\n228\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.530\nYou could see here that they offer\nthe ability to be able to provide\n\n229\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.950\ninformation and provide software and\nhardware that allows us to do this.\n\n230\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.100\nYou'll see new multi-destination\nnetwork forensic imager.\n\n231\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.490\nZXI Forensics, designed for\ndigital forensics labs.\n\n232\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.010\nHigh volume imager,\nblazing fast at over 50 gigs a minute.\n\n233\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.390\nSo they have a product that does that,\n\n234\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.080\nthat will forensically copy\nthat information down for you.\n\n235\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.430\nThere's all sorts of ones you can look at.\n\n236\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.900\nA lot of these will do,\nlet's just go in and take a look at,\n\n237\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.790\nyou know this one for instance.\n\n238\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.100\nJust one of their products.\n\n239\n00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.920\nSo you can see what this looks like.\n\n240\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.960\nMaybe we'll click on a picture there,\nbring it up.\n\n241\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.230\nCan we go full screen so\nwe can see that a little bit better?\n\n242\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.650\nNot that that's much better of course.\n\n243\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.880\nBut you know you get the idea\nit's kind of a platform\n\n244\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.685\nthat you can put multiple\ndrives in on the top.\n\n245\n00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:01.545\nThey're linked on, they're kind\nof linked on on the top there.\n\n246\n00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:02.745\nThere's a control bay, and\n\n247\n00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:06.525\nan LCD screen here, that essentially\nlets you program in what you're doing.\n\n248\n00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:09.815\nSource drives on the left,\ntarget drives on the right kinda thing.\n\n249\n00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:10.935\nCopying one to the other.\n\n250\n00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:13.022\nYou know how that,\nmore or less would work.\n\n251\n00:12:13.022 --> 00:12:16.142\nSo we have that idea where we could\ndo multiple drives all at once.\n\n252\n00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:19.222\nSo this is what a typical product\nmay look like, designed for\n\n253\n00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:22.392\ndigital forensics labs,\ngigabit ethernet ports.\n\n254\n00:12:22.392 --> 00:12:25.692\nWe can push information and\nor pull information.\n\n255\n00:12:25.692 --> 00:12:28.522\nThree evidence drives can be\nworked on simultaneously.\n\n256\n00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:30.752\nSo it has high volume capabilities.\n\n257\n00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:32.182\nSo this is just one example.\n\n258\n00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:36.590\nBut you'll see they have a bunch of\ndifferent forensic solutions here.\n\n259\n00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.720\nThey have hard drive duplicators, so\n\n260\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.380\nthey've got different\nthings that you can use.\n\n261\n00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.880\nWe're looking at the ZXi\nsolution right now, Z Clone Xi.\n\n262\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.780\nSo, there's all sorts of different ones.\n\n263\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.460\nBut, you know, when you do like a\none-to-one, you can see that this one and\n\n264\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.280\nagain, maybe we could just go full-screen.\n\n265\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.862\nYeah, cuz that works so much better.\n\n266\n00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:55.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.230\n&gt;&gt; So, again similar concepts, you know,\n\n268\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.130\nit's hard to see but there's two drives,\none from the front, one from the back.\n\n269\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.490\nThey're kinda connected\nup when you put them in.\n\n270\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.650\nLittle control area, LCD screens and\n\n271\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.610\ncontrols up here that let you kind\nof stipulate what you wanna do.\n\n272\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.040\nThis is a one to one so.\n\n273\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.645\nOne source, one target, as opposed\nto having multiple drive capacity.\n\n274\n00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:17.605\nAnd depending on the speed of the system,\nit may take minutes, hours.\n\n275\n00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:20.584\nIt just depends on how big\nthe amount of data it's removing.\n\n276\n00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:24.690\nIf its a terabyte drive at 50 gigs a\nminute, you do the math and figure it out.\n\n277\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.792\nYou have time to go get a cup of coffee\nand probably go off and do something for\n\n278\n00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:33.308\na couple hours, come back, and then at\nthat point, hopefully, it will be done.\n\n279\n00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:35.941\nSo you can use this kind of a solution.\n\n280\n00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:39.146\nYou also have companies\nlike Digital Intelligence,\n\n281\n00:13:39.146 --> 00:13:41.360\nanother company that's out there.\n\n282\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.640\nIt has a variety of different resources.\n\n283\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.180\nThey have software, they have hardware,\nthey've got all sorts of stuff.\n\n284\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.085\nThis particular area of the website has\na bunch of cables and accessories for\n\n285\n00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:52.685\nvarious things that you may want to do.\n\n286\n00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:56.085\nThey have USB cables, network cables.\n\n287\n00:13:56.085 --> 00:14:00.745\nThey come with forensically sound\nadapters that are gonna be certified, so\n\n288\n00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:03.995\nthey are not gonna modify information,\nthings like that.\n\n289\n00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:09.087\nWe're just scrolling down we have signal\ncables, we have ribbon cables here,\n\n290\n00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:12.365\npower cables, all sorts of stuff,\nas you can see.\n\n291\n00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:15.551\nNot because the stuff we already\nhave in the system is bad, but\n\n292\n00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:20.024\nbecause we have to use alternate material,\nso that we can capture information without\n\n293\n00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:23.120\nviolating the integrity of\nwhat's already in the system.\n\n294\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.026\nSo, if we look at forensic hardware,\n\n295\n00:14:25.026 --> 00:14:27.890\nwe can take a look at the fact\nthey have forensic systems.\n\n296\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.460\nThey have their own systems here.\n\n297\n00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.270\nThey have write blockers, so\n\n298\n00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.840\nyou can see the write blockers\nthat I was talking about.\n\n299\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.415\nThey've got signal and power cables\nthat are shielded from emanation and\n\n300\n00:14:39.415 --> 00:14:40.750\ncross-talk and things like that.\n\n301\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.120\nSo we're not gonna have any\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n302\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.290\nSo if we take a look at forensic write\nblockers, forensic media card, for\n\n303\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.240\ninstance, there's a FireWire right\nblocker, so let's take a look at that one.\n\n304\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.310\nWe'll just pull that one up randomly.\n\n305\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.559\nSo we can see,\nSee now we don't have to go full screen,\n\n306\n00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.140\ncuz that-\n&gt;&gt; That's a picture, yeah.\n\n307\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.030\n&gt;&gt; That's, can we go full screen?\n\n308\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.455\nThat's a bit, see this is why we like-\n&gt;&gt; I'm seeing detail.\n\n309\n00:15:05.455 --> 00:15:07.980\n&gt;&gt; Digital intelligence\ninstead of that other website,\n\n310\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.880\nthe whole small picture thing.\n\n311\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.113\nSo we could say size does matter,\nessentially.\n\n312\n00:15:11.113 --> 00:15:11.885\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does here.\n\n313\n00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:12.427\n&gt;&gt; Is what we can say, right?\n\n314\n00:15:12.427 --> 00:15:15.420\nSo, UltraBlock,\nas you can see here, Firewire,\n\n315\n00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.700\nso what this is,\nis this is a forensic firewall bridge.\n\n316\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.700\nIt's what they normally will call them.\n\n317\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.335\nThis allows us to be able to connect up\nin such a way that we're gonna be able to\n\n318\n00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:28.305\npull data out, but not allow anything\nto back flow into the system.\n\n319\n00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:29.795\nAnd that's essentially what we do.\n\n320\n00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:32.205\nGot all DC in over here for power.\n\n321\n00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:34.711\nWe've got FireWire,\nwe've got a host, we have a USB too,\n\n322\n00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:37.887\nI know it may be hard to see, but\nright down here, these are the labels.\n\n323\n00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:41.257\nYou can't see the connections, but\nthe connections are on the side here.\n\n324\n00:15:41.257 --> 00:15:45.827\nYou'd plug in, and then, we've got the\nability to obviously go through the menu\n\n325\n00:15:45.827 --> 00:15:49.045\nhere and kind of program in what we want,\nlittle on/off switch.\n\n326\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:52.793\nThere's another FireWire port over here\nthat allows us to essentially go out of\n\n327\n00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:53.893\nthe device, right?\n\n328\n00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:56.052\nAnd so we're in or out,\ndepending on which direction you're going.\n\n329\n00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:58.768\nBut my point is secure\nconnections between the device,\n\n330\n00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:00.575\nit's essentially a one-way flow.\n\n331\n00:16:00.575 --> 00:16:04.584\nYou're pulling,\nyou're not able to put back in, right?\n\n332\n00:16:04.584 --> 00:16:08.128\nOr pushing rather, you're pushing out not\npulling in but you're pushing out and\n\n333\n00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:09.900\nwe're not able to flow backwards.\n\n334\n00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.870\nSo that's what the right blocker that\nI've often have been referring to,\n\n335\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.630\nits one example of what one may look like,\nso we would have to have\n\n336\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.545\nthings like automatic write\nprotection like this device provides.\n\n337\n00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:22.095\nWe'd have to have preview capabilities.\n\n338\n00:16:22.095 --> 00:16:25.465\nThese are the kinds of things we wanna\nhave from hardware and or software.\n\n339\n00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:28.425\nWe could actually look at on the front\npanel of a lot of those drive\n\n340\n00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.685\nduplicators although you can't\nreally see it in the picture.\n\n341\n00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:33.205\nBut we can actually get\na kind of status update.\n\n342\n00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:37.122\nWe're not previewing data but we can get\na status update as to what's happening as\n\n343\n00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.729\nthe information coming across.\n\n344\n00:16:38.729 --> 00:16:40.960\nWe may need password cracking software.\n\n345\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.632\nSo Loft Crack or Jack the Ripper,\n\n346\n00:16:42.632 --> 00:16:44.256\nJohn the Ripper rather-\n&gt;&gt; John the Ripper.\n\n347\n00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:47.590\n&gt;&gt; PW Dom to whatever the case may be.\n\n348\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.000\nWe need to understand\nhard drive connectivity,\n\n349\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.650\nwe need to understand media access like\nFireWire, USB, all the various things.\n\n350\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.740\nI was talking about we may have to\ndeal with drives, hard drives, but\n\n351\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.100\nalso deal with tapes, right?\n\n352\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.090\nAlthough tapes are not very common\ntoday but LTO Ultrium or DAT drives.\n\n353\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.910\nWe may have to access to that hardware.\n\n354\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.540\nThose sites will sell all\nthat kind of stuff and\n\n355\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.270\nhave all that kind of technology, so\n\n356\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.730\nwe have to just be aware of the fact that\nstuff is part of our thought process.\n\n357\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.560\nWe also need to think about\nthe idea that as we go through and\n\n358\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.590\nwe are planning out our lab environment.\n\n359\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.160\nAnd we build out all our hardware,\nacquire all that.\n\n360\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.700\nWe have to really examine how\nthe systems are being built,\n\n361\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.200\nhow they're being put together,\nwe often talk about trust but verify.\n\n362\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.050\nJust because we put down in the plans.\n\n363\n00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.470\nWe want these kinds of network connection,\nthis kind of power.\n\n364\n00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.530\nDoesn't mean it's gonna happen.\n\n365\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.560\nWe gotta go through and like anything\nelse examine the ceiling, the floor,\n\n366\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.450\nthe roof, you make sure everything's\nforensically sound, what we don't\n\n367\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.360\nwanna drop ceilings that have you know\nfake spacer or a empty space up above.\n\n368\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.110\nWhere we may have a problem with dust,\n\n369\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.230\nwith may have a problem with temperature\ncontrol, there may be a roof or\n\n370\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.370\nvent up top that's open to the outside\nworld, there could be moisture that get's\n\n371\n00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.150\nin and if it rains heavily\nmaybe we have water damage.\n\n372\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.082\nThese kinds of things can happen, so\nwe gotta think all these stuff right,\n\n373\n00:18:01.082 --> 00:18:02.535\njust to make sure were aware of that.\n\n374\n00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.600\nHow do we actually gather data?\n\n375\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.230\nWell, we know a little bit about that.\n\n376\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.080\nHow do we store data?\n\n377\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.330\nWe've talked a little about that.\n\n378\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.230\nWhat happens when we have to destroy data,\ngetting rid of data,\n\n379\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.410\nthere are standards for data destruction\nwe should be aware of as well.\n\n380\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.086\nWhen we manage a lab with have to\nknow that there are, in the US,\n\n381\n00:18:19.086 --> 00:18:24.383\nDepartment of Defense standards,\nDoD 5220.22M, as in Mary,\n\n382\n00:18:24.383 --> 00:18:31.030\nDoD 5220 -22M would be the standard that\nthe military uses for data destruction.\n\n383\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.588\nThere is the German standard VSITR,\nthere's the Russian\n\n384\n00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:39.390\nstandard Gost PSO73995, there's\na bunch of different ones out there.\n\n385\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.775\n&gt;&gt; The Gordon standard with Thermite,\nright?\n\n386\n00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:44.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is, that's my personal favorite.\n\n387\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.680\nBut yeah,\nthere's all these different ones.\n\n388\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.930\nNot that you would necessarily have\nto adhere to one versus the other.\n\n389\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.670\nBut again, you would have to adhere to\nwhatever standard is the law of the land,\n\n390\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.360\nso to speak, where you operate.\n\n391\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.990\nSo, it is important to\nthink about that and\n\n392\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.050\nto have a sense of that when\nwe're thinking about the lab.\n\n393\n00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.760\nIt's not just, hey, how do I build it?\n\n394\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.690\nHow do I use information\ngathering tools like FireWire,\n\n395\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.250\nwrite blockers to safely get information.\n\n396\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.499\nBut what do when I have to\nget rid of information?\n\n397\n00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:13.941\nOne of the interesting things I think we\ndid this in the cloud CCSP conversation,\n\n398\n00:19:13.941 --> 00:19:15.588\nI don't know if we actually.\n\n399\n00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:17.416\nI'm trying to remember if we\nshowed the Google data center tool\n\n400\n00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:18.753\nvideo I don't know if we did that.\n\n401\n00:19:18.753 --> 00:19:20.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we did.\n\n402\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Then we need to look at it.\n\n403\n00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.170\nIf you haven't seen it, literally,\nif you just go out to Google and\n\n404\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.940\nGoogle for data center, cloud data center.\n\n405\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.160\nYou're gonna find like an eight minute\nvideo that Google did of its own\n\n406\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.060\ndata centers.\n\n407\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.280\nThey did a tour, kind of a guided tour of\ntheir cloud facilities, really cool stuff.\n\n408\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.329\nWe talk about it on the CCSP,\nmaterial that Daniel and I did.\n\n409\n00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:44.693\nBut in there at one point, if you\nwatch the whole video, they actually\n\n410\n00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:48.480\nshow you how they securely destroy hard\ndrives on site in the data center.\n\n411\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.720\nThey've got one of these massive drive\nshredders, looks like one of those big\n\n412\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.450\nchippers that you use to destroy\nthe trees on the side of the road.\n\n413\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.150\nThey feed the drives into this thing and\nthey shred them.\n\n414\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.290\nAnd when I say shred, I mean you\nget confetti out the bottom, right?\n\n415\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.460\nSo it's really cool.\n\n416\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.740\nThese are the thing you would\nneed to do and the standards\n\n417\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.282\nthat you would have to follow to securely\nget rid of data in certain cases.\n\n418\n00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:14.760\nSo, wanna be aware of that, or just in\nour minds have that thought process.\n\n419\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.827\nI don't know if you've actually\never seen a forensics lab.\n\n420\n00:20:17.827 --> 00:20:20.468\nI'm not sure if we actually could go out,\n\n421\n00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:23.719\nI'm think that maybe Google\ndoes have something.\n\n422\n00:20:23.719 --> 00:20:25.386\nI'm gonna take a look here real quick.\n\n423\n00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:26.960\nThere may-\n&gt;&gt; Roll the dice, yeah.\n\n424\n00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.640\n&gt;&gt; There may actually yeah, there may\njust actually be something like a,\n\n425\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.650\nliterally like forensics lab tour, a video\nor something that you can take a look at.\n\n426\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.774\nAnd I'm not sure if there is,\nbut forensics lab,\n\n427\n00:20:40.774 --> 00:20:45.532\nand what I'll do is,\nwe'll just do that, and\n\n428\n00:20:45.532 --> 00:20:50.294\nthen what we'll do is,\nwe'll go to YouTube.\n\n429\n00:20:50.294 --> 00:20:53.790\nNow, we'll just see if we can find\nsomething here in real time, real quick.\n\n430\n00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.840\nBut, it doesn't transfer over,\nit's not like they don't own it,\n\n431\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.750\nthat's kind of stupid.\n\n432\n00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:06.410\nForensics, apps,\nlet's search, and let's see.\n\n433\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.970\nMicrobiology inside the FBI crime lab,\nthat may be kind of cool.\n\n434\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.430\nNatGeo, they'd probably\nshow you some cool stuff.\n\n435\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.554\nAnalyzing forensic evidence\nin the laboratory.\n\n436\n00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:17.492\nSo they've got a bunch of stuff on,\n\n437\n00:21:17.492 --> 00:21:20.940\nwith new state of the art\nforensics laboratory in Boston.\n\n438\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.294\nSo that may be kind of cool, that's\nspecifically a computer forensics one,\n\n439\n00:21:24.294 --> 00:21:25.390\nthat may be kind of neat.\n\n440\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:29.650\nThat looks like the Boston Police\ndepartments, a three minute video.\n\n441\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.090\nSo that one may be kinda cool, you should\nprobably just take a look at that.\n\n442\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.965\nWe're not gonna play it for you now,\nbut just show you that there's\n\n443\n00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:38.142\nprobably stuff out there you could look\nat where you actually could go in and\n\n444\n00:21:38.142 --> 00:21:40.939\njust kind of see what a lab looks like,\nkind of a functioning lab.\n\n445\n00:21:40.939 --> 00:21:44.218\nIf you've never been in one before,\nif you do this kinda work but\n\n446\n00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:47.923\ndo it in a corporate environment,\nyou may not have a formal lab setup like\n\n447\n00:21:47.923 --> 00:21:51.610\nthe police do where they really,\nthey have all the bells and whistles.\n\n448\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.770\nThey have all this stuff.\n\n449\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.018\nYour lab may be your laptop sitting\nat your desk and your cube.\n\n450\n00:21:56.018 --> 00:21:59.788\nWith just some bells and whistles\nassociated with it, it's a very different\n\n451\n00:21:59.788 --> 00:22:03.500\nlook at the world when you see what\na professional lab looks like, once being\n\n452\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.640\ncertified, that meets all the standards\nand you'll follows all the criteria.\n\n453\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.598\nSo I encourage you to take a look at it,\nit's actually pretty neat and\n\n454\n00:22:10.598 --> 00:22:11.926\nyou do wanna think about that.\n\n455\n00:22:11.926 --> 00:22:13.876\nBut in addition to all\nthat basic software,\n\n456\n00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:16.150\nwe need an imaging softwares\nwe've talked about.\n\n457\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.981\nWe need viewing software, so\nwe need Adobe Acrobat and\n\n458\n00:22:18.981 --> 00:22:22.243\nwe need Microsoft software to\nlook at Microsoft documents, so\n\n459\n00:22:22.243 --> 00:22:26.220\nthink through all the logic of all\nthe application software you need.\n\n460\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.239\nYou need network monitors to be\nable to do traffic capture and\n\n461\n00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:31.084\nexamine log files things like that.\n\n462\n00:22:31.084 --> 00:22:35.585\nWe need security software to do password\ncracking and to deal with encryption.\n\n463\n00:22:35.585 --> 00:22:38.527\nIt's just all this different kind of\nsoftware that may exist that we may\n\n464\n00:22:38.527 --> 00:22:41.338\nneed to incorporate and bring in as\nwell that we want to think about.\n\n465\n00:22:41.338 --> 00:22:44.123\nAnd so all this kind of stuff\ngoes into making up the lab and\n\n466\n00:22:44.123 --> 00:22:47.797\nensuring that we understand what\nthe moving parts and components will be.\n\n467\n00:22:47.797 --> 00:22:49.714\nIs gonna be pretty important for the CHFI,\n\n468\n00:22:49.714 --> 00:22:53.018\nwho hopefully wants to not only get\ncertified but also potentially work in\n\n469\n00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:56.715\na real lab environment where you're\nactually working with this material.\n\n470\n00:22:56.715 --> 00:22:58.455\nYou have to understand\nwhat the standards are and\n\n471\n00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:00.360\nunderstand how to operate accordingly.\n\n472\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.330\n&gt;&gt; I don't know be a lot of fun to put\nour own forensics lab together that would\n\n473\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.240\nbe for sure.\n\n474\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.292\nSo that you can play some of these things.\n\n475\n00:23:05.292 --> 00:23:09.871\nIt would be awesome to buy some of\nthose drive duplicators very cool.\n\n476\n00:23:09.871 --> 00:23:11.290\nI just like tech stuff.\n\n477\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.136\nWe are all tech people,\nthat's why we're here.\n\n478\n00:23:13.136 --> 00:23:14.394\nIt would be awesome to have, but\n\n479\n00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:17.145\nthat would also be cool because\nyou're working in that environment,\n\n480\n00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:20.490\nyou need to know how and to understand\nthat these things are available for you.\n\n481\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.150\nIf you said, you know what, I'm going\nto start my own digital forensics\n\n482\n00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.960\nbusiness of some sort, or I'm gonna go\nwork for one that's already standing.\n\n483\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.820\nI can help them with maybe further\nimplementing a larger solution for\n\n484\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.820\ntheir business needs.\n\n485\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.110\nSomething of that nature, you gotta be\nfamiliar with these types of devices and\n\n486\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.070\ntechnologies so that you can speak\nintelligently about them and\n\n487\n00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.640\nmaybe even have some experience with them.\n\n488\n00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.610\nAlways is a great thing to get some\nexperience with these types of stuff.\n\n489\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:50.246\nAdam, thanks for showing us what's\ninvolved in the process of either planning\n\n490\n00:23:50.246 --> 00:23:54.052\nout creating a digital forensics lab or\njust what goes into having\n\n491\n00:23:54.052 --> 00:23:57.534\none that's already freestanding and\nwe appreciate that.\n\n492\n00:23:57.534 --> 00:23:58.239\nThat being said,\n\n493\n00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:01.020\nlooks like we've come to the end of yet\nanother really great episode.\n\n494\n00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.590\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n495\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.870\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n496\n00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.131\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n497\n00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:07.469\n&gt;&gt; I'm a drive duplicator.\n\n498\n00:24:07.469 --> 00:24:09.855\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

00:00:16.981\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:18.782\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n8\n00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:22.885\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.929\nAnd of course, joining us back in\nthe studio for that very endeavor,\n\n10\n00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.610\nour good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.620\nAdam, welcome back, sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, everybody,\nI hope is doing well today.\n\n13\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.810\nWe are gonna talk about something very\nexciting, very basic, elementary, but\n\n14\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.900\nat the same time ever so\nimportant to the forensic investigator.\n\n15\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.572\nWe're gonna talk about hard drives, as\nexciting as that may sound to most of you,\n\n16\n00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:47.260\nI know Daniel's very worked\nup about this episode,\n\n17\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.710\nhe's been running on\nthe studio all excited.\n\n18\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.500\n&gt;&gt; All about.\n\n19\n00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.159\n&gt;&gt; All a tizy,\nall a flutter with anticipation but\n\n20\n00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.832\nwe're gonna talk about\nsome basics involved.\n\n21\n00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:59.185\nCan I have one of those things we stuck\nunder the cabinet there for just a second?\n\n22\n00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:04.690\nWanna talk about the basics involved\nwith essentially what this is, right.\n\n23\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.400\nAnd I'm holding obviously\nin my hand a hard drive.\n\n24\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.270\nWe're gonna take you up close and personal\nwith one here in just a minute and show\n\n25\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.710\nyou how a hard drive is, thank you, sir,\nhow a hard drive is actually constructed.\n\n26\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.380\nWhat are the moving parts, cuz it's\nprobably a good place for us to think\n\n27\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.010\nabout beginning a conversation with\nregards to hard drives and file systems.\n\n28\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.040\nWhen we think about the information\nwe've been talking a lot\n\n29\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.930\nin our prior shows about the information\nthat goes on to a hard drive.\n\n30\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.440\nWhere we store the information?\n\n31\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.850\nHow we interact with it?\n\n32\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.940\nPotentially what we do to pull it back and\nsome of the mechanisms, the methodologies,\n\n33\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.400\nthe techniques we will use to do so.\n\n34\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.720\nWe've really this kind of taken for\n\n35\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.450\ngranted and gloss over a little bit the\nidea of the container itself and it's so\n\n36\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.810\nimportant as an investigator to understand\n\n37\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.190\nthat a hard drive is more literally\nthan just the data you put into it.\n\n38\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.210\nIt's got a lot of moving parts, wanna\nmake sure we understand what they are.\n\n39\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.270\nMost hard drives do, not all,\nw're dealing with SSD drives,\n\n40\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330\nwhole different animal so-to-speak.\n\n41\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.430\nNo moving parts,\nreally just flash memory, flash storage.\n\n42\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.480\nBut we still want to understand\nthe concepts, understand what they are,\n\n43\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.350\nhow they operate, and what makes them up.\n\n44\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.590\nSo I thought it would be a good idea for\n\n45\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.140\nus just to take a look real quick at some\nof the things that are gonna be involved.\n\n46\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.510\nSo if we can go to the overhead shot for\nthe hard drive here for\n\n47\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.540\njust a minute, and Daniel's has already\nmoved himself out of the way so\n\n48\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.500\nwe have no sun spots on the hard drive.\n\n49\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.380\nSo that's gonna be helpful as well.\n\n50\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.168\nI'm gonna use my trustee forensically\nsound examination, tool, i.e,\n\n51\n00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:35.180\nthe ITProTV Twit pen,\nwhich is what we're going to do.\n\n52\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.820\nThere we go can we get it around,\nso there we go,\n\n53\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.280\nsee forensically sound investigative\ntechniques, always important.\n\n54\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.000\n&gt;&gt; Brought to you by our\ngood friends from Twit.\n\n55\n00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly when you go to\ninvestigate a hard drive.\n\n56\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.470\nSo I'm just gonna use\na pen as a pointer so\n\n57\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.090\nyou don't see my big stubby fingers\nget in the way of everything.\n\n58\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.510\nBut what we wanna do is just identify\nsome of the areas of the hard drive.\n\n59\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.770\nWe've got the big circular\narea right in here,\n\n60\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.730\nI'm kind of circling around it,\na theme geometrically progressed here.\n\n61\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.530\nSo this is what we call our platter and\n\n62\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.860\nthere's usually a stack of platters\nin a hard drive like this.\n\n63\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.220\nWe're only showing you the top one but\nthere's more than one,\n\n64\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.120\nthere's usually four, five, six eight,\nhow ever many there may be.\n\n65\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.790\nAnd we're gonna have them stacked up.\n\n66\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.630\nOn both sides of the platter\nthere is gonna be\n\n67\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.190\nsort of a substrate material that has a\nmagnetic coding of some kind, whatever it\n\n68\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.530\nmay be that's gonna actually capture\nthe data magnetically and store it.\n\n69\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.430\nAnd we use one side or both sides of\nthe platter when we store information.\n\n70\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.980\nA lot of people don't realize that we\nactually use sides of the platter, and\n\n71\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.970\nwe coat both sides,\n\n72\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.890\nwe essentially store information\non both sides, just like records.\n\n73\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.280\nIf you remember years ago,\nLP's were double sided traditionally,\n\n74\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.040\nmore often than not\nthey were double sided.\n\n75\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.650\nThey had music on both,\nthat's the concept on the B side, right?\n\n76\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the B side.\n&gt;&gt; And so we would have the A side,\n\n77\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.530\nthe B side and so we're going to have\nthe same idea here except that it's going\n\n78\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.410\nto contain magnetic information on or\naround the platter,\n\n79\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.655\nbased on how we read and\nwrite to and from it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:54.495\nSo, we're gonna see that.\n\n81\n00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:59.180\nThis part right up here kinda a U,\nalmost a U shape,\n\n82\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.015\nsemi-circle if you will, or\nat least a portion of it anyway.\n\n83\n00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:06.267\nIts got a unique identifier or stamp\nnumber here, this is call the actuator.\n\n84\n00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:11.597\nThis is where we're gonna have some of the\nmechanics that control the actual actuator\n\n85\n00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:16.483\naxis and the actuator arm, and ultimately\nthe slider in the read and write head\n\n86\n00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:20.870\nwhich is down here at the bottom,\nkind of in this area right over here.\n\n87\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.232\nI'll move around I'm pointing to it this\nway so you can see it a little better.\n\n88\n00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.550\nIn a record player this would have\nbeen the arm, the tone arm, right,\n\n89\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.490\nthe phonographic record would have been\nred bar we would've listened to it through\n\n90\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.258\nthe needle would have been at the end of\nit, would have tracked across the disk,\n\n91\n00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:38.560\nacross the platters,\nin the grooves that reproduce the sound.\n\n92\n00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.830\nIt's a similar concept,\n\n93\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.900\nif you really think about how\nthe original hard drives were designed.\n\n94\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.240\nThey were designed to work,\nessentially, in a similar way.\n\n95\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.940\nSimilar technology in a sense that we\nhave a control mechanism, the actuator,\n\n96\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.320\nwe have the arm and the mechanics that go\ninto supporting it and making it work.\n\n97\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.900\nAnd we have the equivalent\nof a read/write head,\n\n98\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.410\na needle at the end that\ntracks across the platters and\n\n99\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.100\nreads the information that can be found\nthere, so it's very similar concepts.\n\n100\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.770\nIt's kind of interesting when I often\nthink now I'm casting a shadow.\n\n101\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.490\n[LAUGH] I have to think about, and I had\nthis recently because I have one of those\n\n102\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.460\nrecord players you can use that's a USB,\nthat when you plug it in,\n\n103\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.950\nconverts the LPs into the mp4s or\nwhatever.\n\n104\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.000\nI have an extensive, extensive record\ncollection from when I was a DJ and when I\n\n105\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.180\nwas in the music business for many years\nand talking about thousands and thousands.\n\n106\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.100\nAnd so I've recently started\nthinking about hey can I convert\n\n107\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.130\nsome of that old stuff that\nyou just can't find anywhere.\n\n108\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.760\nAnd so I was looking into\nthe different ways to do it.\n\n109\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.680\nAnd you know pulled one of these\ndevices out that I had in storage.\n\n110\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680\nAnd it's basically pretty much\nidentical with the exception of the,\n\n111\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.820\nI have the old DJ turntable so\nI have the Technics 1200s.\n\n112\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.200\nThe old one,\nwell you may not know what they look like.\n\n113\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.905\nBut they used to have the tone control,\nor the speed control, so\n\n114\n00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:57.815\nyou would have a lever on the side that\nyou could speed up or slow down, so\n\n115\n00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.395\nthat you could actually make\nthe records go faster and slower.\n\n116\n00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:01.105\nBut I digress.\n\n117\n00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:01.955\n&gt;&gt; That must have been fun.\n\n118\n00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:03.705\n&gt;&gt; Because we're not scratching\nwith the hard drive.\n\n119\n00:06:03.705 --> 00:06:05.265\nWe have, I could probably do this.\n\n120\n00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:06.895\nYou gotta make the scratching noise.\n\n121\n00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:10.365\nAll right, so anyway, so\nwe have all this going on here.\n\n122\n00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:12.425\nWe have the, what else do we have?\n\n123\n00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:14.755\nWe have the power connectors,\ncan you help me here?\n\n124\n00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:17.675\nCan you mind standing that up real quick\nso we can see the bottom here, and\n\n125\n00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:18.850\nI'll just point?\n\n126\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.680\nWhen we do that there.\n\n127\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.460\nYeah, probably like that,\nthat's probably good.\n\n128\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.500\nSo we have power, right,\nwe're gonna have power sitting right here.\n\n129\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.090\nWe've got jumper pins, potentially,\n\n130\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.550\nthat we would set that would\nbe available to us right here.\n\n131\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.820\nI'll kinda come in from underneath so\n\n132\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.700\nyou can see that without\nme getting in the way.\n\n133\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.670\nWe don't tend to use those\nvery much these days.\n\n134\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.140\nBut if we have to jump the drive to\nmake it either a master or a slave,\n\n135\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.200\ndepending on what it would be,\nwe would do that here.\n\n136\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.360\nWe have an IDE interface on this drive,\nso we've got our ribbon interface for\n\n137\n00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.970\nan IDE connection.\n\n138\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.950\nThere may be a SCADA, SCSI, you know,\ndifferent kinds of connections.\n\n139\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.950\nWe'll take a look at some other types but\nyou can see here,\n\n140\n00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.810\njust the underlying\nmechanics on the bottom.\n\n141\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.920\nCould you flip that over for\na second, maybe just show the.\n\n142\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.770\nYeah, just put it back down, that's fine.\n\n143\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.690\nAnd what we have on the bottom,\nyou'll typically,\n\n144\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.390\nyou've got some sort of identifier.\n\n145\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.020\nThere's usually a serial number,\n\n146\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.660\nsome sort of unique identifier on\nthe drive tells you what it is.\n\n147\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.320\nYou have the circuits,\nyou don't really see anything.\n\n148\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.350\nThis is just the back end of the circuit\nboard that is gonna form the mechanics and\n\n149\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.040\nthe brain of the drive inside.\n\n150\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.900\nBut you always see this on the bottom.\n\n151\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.210\nThis is the bottom end of where\nthe platter is actually housed, and\n\n152\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.600\nthe bottom end of the spindle and\nthe actuator information, the arm and\n\n153\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.120\neverything that's here,\nis trailing off this way and\n\n154\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.420\nthis is just the bottom end where\neverything's kind of connect, right.\n\n155\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.020\nSo it's what a typical\ndrive looks like and\n\n156\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.960\nthis allows us to be able to work with or\nstore information in there that we\n\n157\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.370\ncan then access whenever we have\na need to so it's kind of interesting.\n\n158\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.360\nIf we wanna just quickly come over here,\nto my, if we could just quickly,\n\n159\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.680\nI should say, come over here to\nmy machine for a quick second.\n\n160\n00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.336\nCould we just go full screen for a second?\n\n161\n00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.360\nI just wanna show our studio audience.\n\n162\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.904\nIf you wanna see other hard drive\ninterfaces, all I did was go to Google,\n\n163\n00:07:54.904 --> 00:07:58.461\ngo to Google images You could see I\njust searched hard drive interfaces.\n\n164\n00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.126\nThose of you that may not be as\nfamiliar with some of this stuff,\n\n165\n00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.500\nthis is almost like A+ 101, right?\n\n166\n00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.890\nHardware basics, we don't spend a lot of\ntime on it in this kind of a discussion.\n\n167\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.985\nReally just giving you a general idea\nto frame the conversation, if you will.\n\n168\n00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:18.000\nBut if you're a little more interested,\nwanna drill down a little bit, learn more,\n\n169\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.910\nsee more about what SATA looks like,\nSCSI, SSD drives, SAS, PATA, IDE, etc.\n\n170\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.410\nYou could just take a look according\nto the catalogue there at the top.\n\n171\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.120\nChoose whatever area you want, and\n\n172\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.860\nyou'll see all sorts of\ndifferent interface pictures.\n\n173\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.500\nAnd you'll obviously be\nable to interact with and\n\n174\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.320\ntake a look at all sorts\nof different information.\n\n175\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.930\nSo, it just may be worth a few\nminutes of your time just so\n\n176\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.010\nyou can become better acquainted\nwith what's in there.\n\n177\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.777\nIt'll make it a little bit easier for\n\n178\n00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:48.628\nyou to be able to just have\na sense of different hard drives.\n\n179\n00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:50.674\nWhen we do investigative work, Dave and\n\n180\n00:08:50.674 --> 00:08:54.200\nI were talking about this before\nwe got started this morning.\n\n181\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.188\nWe often will be called on to grab\nthe information from the drive.\n\n182\n00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:02.410\nWe've been talking a lot about how to\ndo that forensically in a sound manner.\n\n183\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.440\nHow to grab that information,\n\n184\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.050\nhow to take a look at it,\nhow to do things like that, right?\n\n185\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.820\nAnd so the idea is that we may\ntake a drive like that and\n\n186\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.740\nthat maybe just a standard ID, a PATA,\na SAS drive, SATA, whatever it maybe, SSD.\n\n187\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.044\nBut different drives mechanically\nsetup to work different ways\n\n188\n00:09:21.044 --> 00:09:23.890\nall store information\nat the end of the day.\n\n189\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.440\nThe challenge for\nus will be when we take that drive out\n\n190\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.020\nof the physical constraints\nof the machine it's in.\n\n191\n00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.250\nSo when we capture that forensic image\noffline, after we capture the actual\n\n192\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.340\nvolatile data, right, we've talked\nabout how to do some of that already.\n\n193\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.790\nWe'll talk about doing more of that as\nwe go in this show, a little bit, and\n\n194\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.500\nthrough the upcoming discussions.\n\n195\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.040\nWe often will take the physical drive\nout of the box or out of the device.\n\n196\n00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.390\nAnd as we showed you in a prior\ndiscussion, we'll throw it up on a drive\n\n197\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.900\nimaging system, and we'll connect it and\nwe'll do a drive to drive image.\n\n198\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.710\nWhen we do that, we're doing it offline.\n\n199\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.260\nSo we just have to recognize\nthe kind of drive we have\n\n200\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.180\nto make sure we have the right\nkind of connections.\n\n201\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.542\nAnd that we're able to\nthen sync that drive up,\n\n202\n00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:06.088\nessentially set it up on the hardware\ncopying device or on the station,\n\n203\n00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:07.939\nmounted with the right connectors.\n\n204\n00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:11.215\nAnd then have a duplicate drive\nthat's of at least the same size,\n\n205\n00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:14.080\nand that way,\nwe can then access the information.\n\n206\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.129\nSo it is important to recognize\ndifferent drive types.\n\n207\n00:10:16.129 --> 00:10:18.613\nIt's important to have a sense\nof what they look like,\n\n208\n00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.782\nimportant to have an idea\nof how they interact.\n\n209\n00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.720\nThere are two drive types distinctly.\n\n210\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.200\nThere are internal, what we call fixed\ndrives, that are gonna be inside a system.\n\n211\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.040\nThis kind of a hard drive we were looking\nat would be a good example of that.\n\n212\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.270\nWhen it was actually hooked up and\n\n213\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.520\nrunning and\nthen we would have external drives, right?\n\n214\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.700\nWhether it's a little thumb drive, whether\nit is an external drive that looks similar\n\n215\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.630\nto the one we showed you, but\nin its own protective case.\n\n216\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.381\nAnd we hook it up through\na USB cable traditionally or\n\n217\n00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.790\nsome other type of external connection.\n\n218\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.520\nWe've probably all seen and\ninteracted with those.\n\n219\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.280\nA lot of us carry them around in our\npockets, right, as thumb drives.\n\n220\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.210\nWhatever it may be, just keep in mind,\nwe have two different drive types.\n\n221\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.960\nAnd we just wanna think about that.\n\n222\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.150\nThe main components of the hard drive\nthat we took a look at mechanically,\n\n223\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.570\nwe talked about the different components,\nthe arm,\n\n224\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.040\nthe actuator, the spindle,\nthe platters, all that.\n\n225\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.010\nBut we think about the actual main\ncomponents in terms of data storage and\n\n226\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.500\nmanipulation as being cylinders,\nheads, and platters,\n\n227\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.020\ntalked about the platter already.\n\n228\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.450\nWe talked about the concept of\nthe information being stored there, but\n\n229\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.150\nwhen we think about it, we often, or\nnot often, we will, I should say, identify\n\n230\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.770\ncylinders, heads, and platters as being\nthe three main components of a hard drive.\n\n231\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.960\nAgain, the main components that\nare involved with the information storage\n\n232\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.430\nas opposed to the mechanics that\nare involved with actually allowing us to\n\n233\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.190\ninteract with the information, like the\nspindle, the arm, things of that nature,\n\n234\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.690\nthe actuator, etc.\n\n235\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.600\nWe also think about density,\nhow do we store information in a drive?\n\n236\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.580\nAnd most importantly,\n\n237\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.760\nhow do we measure the amount of\ndata that is stored in a drive?\n\n238\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.910\nAnd we think about three\ndifferent kinds of density.\n\n239\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.750\nWe think about track density,\nareal density or areal density,\n\n240\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.010\nyou hear it referred to differently.\n\n241\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.110\nAnd, or Ariel Grande density, but that's\na whole different kind of conversation.\n\n242\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.890\nAnd, or bit density, right, so track\ndensity, areal density, or real density,\n\n243\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.840\nand bit density.\n\n244\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.270\nTrack density is the number of tracks\nthat are actually in the hard drive or\n\n245\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.390\nhard disk itself.\n\n246\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.370\nThink of the platter, think of\na circle if you will, the platter.\n\n247\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.360\nThink of a line drawn around the circle.\n\n248\n00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.155\nThat would be a track that\ngoes all the way around, and\n\n249\n00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:21.450\nit is a consistent line that is in\nthe same plane going all the way around.\n\n250\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.100\nThink of an old LP record.\n\n251\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.090\nAnd think of the lines or tracks on that.\n\n252\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.520\nThat's how we would track\nacross to hear the music.\n\n253\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.810\nThat's what a track is.\n\n254\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.640\nAnd so, we think about track density,\nthe number of tracks in the hard drive,\n\n255\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.610\nareal density, number of bits\nper square inch on the platter,\n\n256\n00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.330\nhow much information can we put into\na square inch of real estate, so to speak,\n\n257\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.030\non the platter,\nwe mentioned that as areal density.\n\n258\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.980\nAnd bit density, the number of\nbits per unit length of track,\n\n259\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.920\nthe amount of bits actually in a certain\nmeasurement of the track itself.\n\n260\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.110\nAnd when we think about\nthese density measures,\n\n261\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.640\nwe use them in combination to understand\n\n262\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.920\nthe amount of information that's\nactually going to be stored on a drive.\n\n263\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.550\nWhen we record information, we talk about\nthe data being recorded to the hard drive.\n\n264\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.010\nWhen was the last time you talked about\ndata being recorded to a hard drive?\n\n265\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.440\nWe just say I put something on the drive,\nor I stored it there, or\n\n266\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.490\nI copied it, right?\n\n267\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.540\nThis is the information, or rather,\nthe language that we tend to use normally\n\n268\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.720\nin terms of being IT professionals,\nsecurity professionals.\n\n269\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.770\nWe don't tend to walk around saying\nI recorded my file onto the hard\n\n270\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.750\ndrive this morning.\n\n271\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.742\nIt's just not how you hear people speak.\n\n272\n00:13:23.742 --> 00:13:26.163\nBut the reality is that's\nthe formal way we talk about this.\n\n273\n00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:28.661\nWe talked about data being\nrecorded to the hard drive.\n\n274\n00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:32.610\nAnd we record it using what's\ncalled zoned bit recording, ZBR.\n\n275\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.581\nIt's fun to say, zoned bit recording.\n\n276\n00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.391\n&gt;&gt; Zebra almost.\n\n277\n00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:36.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Almost like a zebra,\n\n278\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.400\nexcept it's not black and white, it's\na lot of gray, but zoned bit recording.\n\n279\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.070\nThis is actually grouping tracks into\nzones, so the idea of grouping the tracks\n\n280\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.970\nwe talked about into zones based on their\ndistance from the center of the disk.\n\n281\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.330\nCan you flip that back over for\nme for a second, and\n\n282\n00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.840\ncan we just go back to\nthe overhead shot and?\n\n283\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.662\nLovely, you could be a hand model, sir.\n\n284\n00:13:54.662 --> 00:13:55.982\nYou remember those commercials years ago?\n\n285\n00:13:55.982 --> 00:13:56.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n286\n00:13:56.486 --> 00:13:58.001\n&gt;&gt; The Palmolive,\nwe're talking about Palmolive, remember?\n\n287\n00:13:58.001 --> 00:13:58.805\nExactly, there you go.\n\n288\n00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mr Daniel, everybody,\n\n289\n00:14:00.891 --> 00:14:03.670\nMr Daniel, that's how you're\ngonna be known from now on.\n\n290\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.212\nSo when we look at the platter here,\nright,\n\n291\n00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:10.408\nand we're thinking about this idea\nof the zoned bit recording concept,\n\n292\n00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:15.116\nwe can't see tracks because you don't see\ntracks on the surface of the platter.\n\n293\n00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:18.416\nBut if you were to take a look at\na picture of a phonograph record, an LP,\n\n294\n00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:20.460\nyou would probably see the tracks, right?\n\n295\n00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.510\nYou could actually see them.\n\n296\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.940\nImagine a line, this is drawn literally\nlike this all the way around.\n\n297\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.083\nIt would be a track, and imagine\nthousands of them across the platter,\n\n298\n00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:33.101\nbut instead of being there physically,\nthey are magnetic, right?\n\n299\n00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.095\nSo we're gonna see them, but\nthe lines are invisible to us.\n\n300\n00:14:36.095 --> 00:14:37.865\nBut they're there and the head reads them.\n\n301\n00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:41.115\nSo when we read across,\nwe have these tracks, right?\n\n302\n00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:45.195\nAnd what we do is we group\nthe tracks together into zones.\n\n303\n00:14:45.195 --> 00:14:50.505\nSo maybe there is, let's just say,\nhypothetically, this area right here.\n\n304\n00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:52.715\nIf we just kinda block off maybe an area,\n\n305\n00:14:52.715 --> 00:14:56.100\nkinda circle around it,\nlet's say that area, all the way around,\n\n306\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.330\nis zone one, right, and\nthen zone two, and zone three, etc.\n\n307\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.997\nWe do that based on distance from the\ninner sanctum of the drive right here in\n\n308\n00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:04.817\nthe middle, spin it all the way out.\n\n309\n00:15:04.817 --> 00:15:06.252\nAnd we group them together, and\n\n310\n00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:09.550\nwe measure them based on their\ndistance from the center of the disk.\n\n311\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.530\nAnd this is what the zoned\nbit recording concept is.\n\n312\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.148\nWe actually use the geometry\nof the drive and\n\n313\n00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:19.411\nset it up in such way that we can track\nwhere information will be stored.\n\n314\n00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:23.224\nAnd obviously, most important thing\nto consider is having a map, right,\n\n315\n00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:24.202\nto read the drive.\n\n316\n00:15:24.202 --> 00:15:27.694\nIf you think about the fact\nthat we can randomly scatter or\n\n317\n00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:31.844\nrecord information across that drive in so\nmany different places,\n\n318\n00:15:31.844 --> 00:15:35.729\nthat it's very difficult for\nus to understand where it may be.\n\n319\n00:15:35.729 --> 00:15:37.101\nUnless we have a map of some kind,\n\n320\n00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.306\nwe have a way of understanding\nwhere the data was put.\n\n321\n00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.214\nAnd as a result, how to retrieve it.\n\n322\n00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:43.126\nYou ever put something down and\nforget where you put it?\n\n323\n00:15:43.126 --> 00:15:43.645\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n324\n00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:46.707\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt just happens continuously.\n\n325\n00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:50.643\nSo when you do that, imagine you now\nhaving to think through and go back and\n\n326\n00:15:50.643 --> 00:15:53.555\nfigure out, hey,\ndid I leave my keys on the table?\n\n327\n00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.740\nDid I put them down somewhere outside?\n\n328\n00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.130\nWhat did I do with them, where are they?\n\n329\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.666\nImagine having to have to do that\nevery time you wanted to find a file.\n\n330\n00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:02.660\nIt would slow things down so much,\nyou could never read information.\n\n331\n00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.850\nAnd so, as a result,\n\n332\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.680\nwe have to be almost instantaneously\nable to pull that data back.\n\n333\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.800\nAnd keeping track of it, using this\nmechanism to record, allows us, well not\n\n334\n00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.730\nus directly, but allows the system and the\ninterfaces that we use, the hardware and\n\n335\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.360\nthe software of the control systems\nin the drive and around the drive.\n\n336\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.600\nAnd the operating system can actually\nfind the information for us.\n\n337\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.275\nIt's, one can almost say, foolproof.\n\n338\n00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Except it's not.\n\n339\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.420\n&gt;&gt; Except it's not and except when we\nlet users use it, it becomes, then,\n\n340\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.010\na challenge because we all know that\nusers are the reason we exist in IT.\n\n341\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.600\nSo that we have something to do and\npeople to make fun of.\n\n342\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.294\n&gt;&gt; The computers alone,\neverything would work fine.\n\n343\n00:16:39.294 --> 00:16:41.862\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's actually the beauty of things like\n\n344\n00:16:41.862 --> 00:16:42.370\nthe Matrix.\n\n345\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.180\nRight, if you think about it, it's\nthe perfect system because it works fine\n\n346\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.150\nbecause they don't let humans interact.\n\n347\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.680\nIt's when humans interact, when you let\nNeo loose, everything goes crazy, right?\n\n348\n00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.560\n&gt;&gt; Everything goes nuts.\n\n349\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.260\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about it, the perfect\ntechnological utopia at the end of\n\n350\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.300\nthe world is gonna be a place where\nusers are not allowed to touch machines.\n\n351\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:16:59.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n352\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.925\n&gt;&gt; IT professionals\nwill be out of the job.\n\n353\n00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:04.100\nWe'll all be batteries\nlike powering the matrix,\n\n354\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.040\nbut reality is the computers\nwill work the right way.\n\n355\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.946\n&gt;&gt; That is fine, yeah.\n\n356\n00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:09.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But then somebody says yeah, but\n\n357\n00:17:09.749 --> 00:17:13.004\nthen we have all this programs in there,\nthings were screwed up anyway and\n\n358\n00:17:13.004 --> 00:17:13.540\nwhatever.\n\n359\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.260\nBut we wouldn't know about it, we wouldn't\nhave to fix it, so it won't matter.\n\n360\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.130\n&gt;&gt; Ignorance is bliss.\n\n361\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.450\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly my point,\nignorance is bliss.\n\n362\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.550\nSo children stay ignorant, that is\nthe most important thing we can tell you.\n\n363\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.210\n&gt;&gt; Do not stay-\n&gt;&gt; No, no, we're kidding.\n\n364\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Educate yourselves.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Educate yourselves.\n\n365\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.974\nKnowledge is power.\n\n366\n00:17:27.974 --> 00:17:29.060\nAll right, so hard drives.\n\n367\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.660\nWe've talked about\nthe different types external,\n\n368\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.860\ninternal, broke down the geometry\na little bit, talked about how we record.\n\n369\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.913\nI mentioned some of\nthe different interfaces.\n\n370\n00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:38.710\nI showed you that you could go out,\nquickly take a look at some of them.\n\n371\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.300\nWhat are some of the popular hard drive\ninterfaces there sir, what do you think?\n\n372\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.259\n&gt;&gt; SATA is probably most\npopular out there right now.\n\n373\n00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:46.048\n&gt;&gt; So ATA, whether it's SATA or PATA,\n\n374\n00:17:46.048 --> 00:17:46.635\nright,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n375\n00:17:46.635 --> 00:17:50.045\n&gt;&gt; Because we have twos, serial ATA or\nparallel ATA, those are popular.\n\n376\n00:17:50.045 --> 00:17:51.207\n&gt;&gt; SCSI's are still running around?\n\n377\n00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:54.457\n&gt;&gt; SCSI's probably the most popular and\nmost widely deployed,\n\n378\n00:17:54.457 --> 00:17:57.725\nnot just in terms of hard drives but\nalso in terms of protocol.\n\n379\n00:17:57.725 --> 00:18:00.735\nStorage protocol, SCSI is locally-\n&gt;&gt; The iSCSI.\n\n380\n00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:02.820\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say local\nin the hard- In the system.\n\n381\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.680\niSCSI, internet based SCSI, the most\npopular storage protocol in the world.\n\n382\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.940\nSo go that going on.\n\n383\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.900\nSo we got that.\n\n384\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.660\nAn oldie but a goodie,\nof course, is IDE we know.\n\n385\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.039\nEIDE which is kind of\na enhanced version of IDE,\n\n386\n00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:18.214\nbecause it wasn't good enough the first\ntime, so we thought we'd make it better.\n\n387\n00:18:18.214 --> 00:18:21.080\nFiber channel right, and USB.\n\n388\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.910\nSo we got a whole bunch of different ones.\n\n389\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.630\nI think five if we just list them all out.\n\n390\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.125\nLet's just go through them quickly in\norder just you know what they are.\n\n391\n00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:34.120\nBut SCSI, ATA as Dave mentioned,\nserial and parallel underneath ATA, USB.\n\n392\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.860\nSo that would be three.\n\n393\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.780\nFiber channel and, of course,\nIDE or e, IDE enhanced IDE.\n\n394\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.790\nSo just think about those.\n\n395\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.120\nThose are the traditional hard drive\ninterfaces that we will often see.\n\n396\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.390\nWe'll often use in some form or another.\n\n397\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.775\nWant to make sure we're aware of them.\n\n398\n00:18:49.775 --> 00:18:54.218\nAgain, lists of things like that always\nhelpful to have at hand if you're planning\n\n399\n00:18:54.218 --> 00:18:57.328\non studying for, maybe taking,\nCHFI exam at some point,\n\n400\n00:18:57.328 --> 00:19:00.290\nbe good general information for\nyou to reference.\n\n401\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.090\nWe've talked about platters and\ntracks a little bit.\n\n402\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.090\nTalked about the concept of how they work,\nhow they come together.\n\n403\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.990\nHaven't mentioned\nthe concept of the sector.\n\n404\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.250\nBut let's just go through and\n\n405\n00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.470\nkind of quickly put this all back\ninto perspective, so to speak.\n\n406\n00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.270\nRemember, platters are the round flat\ndiscs that hold the data inside of\n\n407\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.990\nthe hard drive that we took a look at.\n\n408\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.340\nThey're made up of a substrate, some sort\nof coating on both sides, a magnetic\n\n409\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.242\nmaterial that would be interspersed on the\ncoating to store the data magnetically.\n\n410\n00:19:26.242 --> 00:19:28.570\nData is written on both sides of\nthe platter as we talked about,\n\n411\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.420\njust some ideas and things to keep\nin mind or think about there.\n\n412\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.880\nWe talked about tracks.\n\n413\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.200\nThe track is that\nconcentric circular ring.\n\n414\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.090\nAgain, it would be on both\nsides of the platter.\n\n415\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.900\nWe use both sides,\nwe have tracks on both sides.\n\n416\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.160\nWe didn't really talk about\nthat particular piece, but\n\n417\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.640\nI just want to make\nsure you remember that.\n\n418\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.670\nWe talked about the drive head\nbeing able to read across, right,\n\n419\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.690\nthe arm being able to track across the\nplatter, reading the tracks as it goes.\n\n420\n00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.190\nWe talked about the zoning and\ngrouping of tracks.\n\n421\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.070\nTracks are numbered for\nidentification purposes,\n\n422\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.230\nI think I mentioned that, track one,\ntrack two, whatever the case may be.\n\n423\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.620\nAnd, we read by rolling over or\nessentially tracking across the platter.\n\n424\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.320\nIt's kind of interesting\nwhen you watch it happen.\n\n425\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.200\nYou ever see those YouTube videos\nwhere they actually show a hard drive\n\n426\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.120\nkind of like the one we have\nwhere it's open, hooked up and\n\n427\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.950\nthey show you where it's\nreading across in real time?\n\n428\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.390\nIt's kind of interesting\nif you've never seen that.\n\n429\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.655\nIf you haven't,\nit's a lot of fun just to take a look at.\n\n430\n00:20:17.655 --> 00:20:20.080\nBecause it's literally,\nit's a black box technology.\n\n431\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.230\nThe average hard drive is totally encased.\n\n432\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.180\nThe one we have here has a little glass,\n\n433\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.790\nkind of plexi glass clear,\nwhatever it is cover.\n\n434\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.240\nIt'd be cool if it was bulletproof,\nlook it's bulletproof.\n\n435\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.340\nBut it's just clear so we could show you,\nright, the inner workings of the drive, so\n\n436\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.430\nwe can essentially explain it to you.\n\n437\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.800\nMost drives don't look like that.\n\n438\n00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.890\nThey look the first drive I held up,\nwhich has got that metal cover,\n\n439\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.515\nall encased, cuz drives take a lot\nof wear and tear, a lot of abuse.\n\n440\n00:20:44.515 --> 00:20:48.130\n[LAUGH] I'm ashamed to admit it, but when\nI was getting ready to get out of the car\n\n441\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.870\nthe first day I got here when I drove up,\nit was really late.\n\n442\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.620\nI got in at 2, 3 in the morning,\nwhatever it was.\n\n443\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.840\nAnd I'm getting my bag out of the car,\nmy go bag.\n\n444\n00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.110\nAnd I meant to like,\nI rested it up on the seat.\n\n445\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.701\nRan around to get something,\nall of a sudden, I hear a flack.\n\n446\n00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:03.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I come around, I'm like.\n\n447\n00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.290\nIt's laying on the floor, dropped it.\n\n448\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.950\nAnd I have two tablets in there.\n\n449\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.420\nI got my laptop which is why\nit's held together with tape.\n\n450\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Because constantly doing this.\n\n451\n00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:14.971\nThrowing it up in the overhead bin,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n452\n00:21:14.971 --> 00:21:18.560\nSo I dropped it, I actually dropped it,\nit fell not far, but it fell hard.\n\n453\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because it has all that weight in it.\n\n454\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.218\nAnd I was really [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:21:21.218 --> 00:21:22.301\n&gt;&gt; Actually concerned,\n\n456\n00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.300\ncuz I thought I may have broke something.\n\n457\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.844\nBut the drives are pretty shock resistant.\n\n458\n00:21:26.844 --> 00:21:30.513\nI mean, I have SSD drives in my tablets,\nyou don't really have to worry about\n\n459\n00:21:30.513 --> 00:21:32.547\nthose, when there's no moving parts,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n460\n00:21:32.547 --> 00:21:33.918\n&gt;&gt; You can't break anything.\n\n461\n00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:38.915\nBut in the traditional drive of my laptop,\nI've got, I don't know, I'm guessing it's\n\n462\n00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:43.740\nprobably either an IDE or some sort of a,\nit's probably a SATA, something like that.\n\n463\n00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.230\nMaybe a PATA drive, I don't know what.\n\n464\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.790\nBut it's probably an ATA drive of some\nkind in here, although my laptop's so\n\n465\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.623\nold it could actually be an IDE drive.\n\n466\n00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:51.892\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be that.\n\n467\n00:21:51.892 --> 00:21:54.095\n&gt;&gt; It could be the original IDE drive.\n\n468\n00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:56.650\nBut it's sitting in here, but\nit's got all the moving parts,\n\n469\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.970\nit just that it's a laptop drive,\nit's a two and a half inch form factor.\n\n470\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.230\nLooks like a business part, right,\n\n471\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.090\nas opposed to the bigger\nones we use in desktops.\n\n472\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.940\nAnd theses things, not that you want to\ntake them out and skim them across a pond,\n\n473\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.930\nright, or use them for target practice.\n\n474\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:16.310\nBut reality is, they're pretty heavy\nduty in terms of their construction.\n\n475\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.300\nYou could drop these things from 5,\n10, 15,\n\n476\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.930\n20 feet and they're gonna be fine,\ntraditionally,\n\n477\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.850\nas long as you're not pelting them,\nand constantly throwing them around.\n\n478\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.700\nSo they're pretty rugged, and\nyou want to understand that.\n\n479\n00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.610\nThey will survive a certain amount of,\nessentially, wear and\n\n480\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.330\ntear and abuse, but\nwe don't wanna put that to the test.\n\n481\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I could see somebody out there now,\n\n482\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.400\nstupid ITProTV trick,\nsomebody's gotta machine or\n\n483\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.990\nsomething they're driving over\nthe hard drive with a truck.\n\n484\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.920\n&gt;&gt; Wanted to see if it worked.\n\n485\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could do that.\n\n486\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.380\nDrive over the laptop,\npull the hard drive out.\n\n487\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.900\n&gt;&gt; You haven't lived until you've\ntaken a two pound sledgehammer and\n\n488\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.770\nbeat a hard drive to death.\n\n489\n00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:51.570\nIt is cathartic.\n\n490\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.690\n&gt;&gt; You remember Office [CROSSTALK]\nYou remember Office Space?\n\n491\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n492\n00:22:54.325 --> 00:22:56.336\nwhere they're out there beating the hell\nout of the fax machine in the thing.\n\n493\n00:22:56.336 --> 00:22:57.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n494\n00:22:57.975 --> 00:23:01.420\nSo you apparently, this is just actually,\nsince you brought it up.\n\n495\n00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.755\nSo this is our official random aside for\nthis episode.\n\n496\n00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:04.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta have a header or\n\n497\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.910\nsomething that comes up.\n\n498\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.651\n&gt;&gt; Random aside, random aside.\n\n499\n00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.290\n&gt;&gt; Random aside, flashing or something.\n\n500\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.990\nSo, since we're talking about this,\nsince you led me down this stray path, so\n\n501\n00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.900\nif you remember,\nas you said you remember Office Space.\n\n502\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.200\nBy the way, awesome movie.\n\n503\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.330\nIf you have not seen it,\nyou much go out and watch this movie.\n\n504\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely fantastic.\n\n505\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.900\nBut roughly about half\nway through the movie,\n\n506\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.690\nyou got this scene where the three\nprincipals are in this field and\n\n507\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:32.955\nthey essentially are just beating the snot\nout of a piece of office equipment.\n\n508\n00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:35.225\nAnd it's a great scene.\n\n509\n00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:38.405\nBut apparently,\nI read this in the last few days,\n\n510\n00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:41.935\nwhich is just crazy when you think about\nhow things go around and come back.\n\n511\n00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:46.585\nSo now they've got these things called\nstress rooms where apparently you go.\n\n512\n00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:47.695\nThis is like a thing-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n513\n00:23:47.695 --> 00:23:48.625\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo you go.\n\n514\n00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:50.315\nThis is business, right?\n\n515\n00:23:50.315 --> 00:23:53.422\nYou go to this place and\nthey set you up in this,\n\n516\n00:23:53.422 --> 00:23:56.871\nessentially like this\nInsane asylum kind of room.\n\n517\n00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:58.044\nIt's all padded, right?\n\n518\n00:23:58.044 --> 00:24:00.915\nCeiling to floor, and\nthey put on the protective gear.\n\n519\n00:24:00.915 --> 00:24:03.620\nIt's got the eye goggles, and\nbody wear, and everything.\n\n520\n00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.586\nThey give you bats, and they let\nyou beat the hell out of anything.\n\n521\n00:24:06.586 --> 00:24:08.922\nThey'll put like TV's,\nthey'll put it's like-\n\n522\n00:24:08.922 --> 00:24:09.804\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:10.803\n&gt;&gt; It's the office space concept.\n\n524\n00:24:10.803 --> 00:24:13.380\nApparently, this is the latest craze.\n\n525\n00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.060\nAnd it is just sweeping society.\n\n526\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.590\nPeople are just going there and\nbeating stuff up.\n\n527\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.810\nAnd it's supposed to be, obviously,\na stress relief and whatever.\n\n528\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.014\nAnd they say it's supposed\nto be a real thing.\n\n529\n00:24:24.014 --> 00:24:26.034\n&gt;&gt; But we've got a lot of\npent up anger here, right?\n\n530\n00:24:26.034 --> 00:24:27.341\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just letting you know,\n\n531\n00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:27.920\nyou think about it.\n\n532\n00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.030\nYou could just go out in the back of\n\n533\n00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.060\nthe parking lot-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n534\n00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.550\nAnd do this for free, but you're paying\nsomebody to let you go do it in a room.\n\n535\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.177\nAnd they apparently,\nthey'll record it and give it to you.\n\n536\n00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:40.480\nLook, this is you taking\na bat to your HP printer.\n\n537\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.490\nHere you are for Christmas or Hanukkah.\n\n538\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.660\nIt's crazy.\n\n539\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.235\n&gt;&gt; Go chop down a tree,\nit costs a whole lot less money.\n\n540\n00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:47.810\n[LAUGH].\n\n541\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.880\n&gt;&gt; There are certain things I understand,\nand I will rant and\n\n542\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.920\nrave about them on\noccasion in front of you.\n\n543\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.070\nThere are other things that\njust despite my age, and\n\n544\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.730\ndespite my experience,\nI cannot have a frame or reference for.\n\n545\n00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.860\nThis is one of them.\n\n546\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda moving us\nback toward the hard drive\n\n547\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.090\nconstruction being so robust.\n\n548\n00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.920\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, if it's on and\nit's moving, jilting and tipping and\n\n549\n00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.090\nthings of that nature with a physical hard\ndrive, not the best idea in the world.\n\n550\n00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.870\n&gt;&gt; No, no ,no, you go screw things up.\n\n551\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.730\nBut at the same time, right-\n&gt;&gt; But if you take it out.\n\n552\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:22.770\n&gt;&gt; If you take it out, because it's not\nmoving, obviously it's a lot less likely.\n\n553\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.790\nBecause if you think about it,\nif you have a record player, and\n\n554\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.020\nyou pick it up while it's in motion, and\nyou start doing one of these with it.\n\n555\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.650\nYou're going to probably scratch most\nlikely everything, the arms gonna jump and\n\n556\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.310\nfall off, things like that.\n\n557\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.080\nYou're gonna lose the ability\nto track the information.\n\n558\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.240\nWe don't have a sense of\nthat in the hard drive,\n\n559\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.590\nbecause the arm won't necessary\njump off the platter, but it could\n\n560\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.600\nin moving across the platter skip, and\nas a result you get an error in the read.\n\n561\n00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.220\nAnd that's something to consider\ncuz we're tracking both sides.\n\n562\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.100\nSo the arm is typically going to be\nsandwiched in between the read arms, or\n\n563\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.630\nsandwiched in between the platters.\n\n564\n00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.390\nSo they move kind of like this across and\nthey're spinning around them.\n\n565\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.370\nBut they can, there's a little wiggle\nroom in there right they'll jump And so\n\n566\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.640\nthat's one of the issues we have.\n\n567\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.530\nSo no live skeet, or\n\n568\n00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.640\ntarget practice with your laptops\nwhile you're trying to read data.\n\n569\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.010\nThat would not be good.\n\n570\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.640\nBut you can imagine, you go into this\nroom and you start beating things,\n\n571\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.500\nI just I don't get it.\n\n572\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.760\n&gt;&gt; We could open up a hard\ndrive smashing business.\n\n573\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.969\nI guarantee it would fly like gangbusters.\n\n574\n00:26:15.969 --> 00:26:19.516\n&gt;&gt; That and also childcare next door would\nbe like, because you need a place to put\n\n575\n00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:22.735\nthe kids when you're in there beating\nthe heck out of the hard drives.\n\n576\n00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:25.190\n[LAUGH] So anyway, so sectors, clusters,\n\n577\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.540\nlet's just finish talking about all the\nparts that make this hard drive up, and\n\n578\n00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.040\nwe'll wrap up the particular conversation.\n\n579\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.540\nSo sectors are the smallest physical\nstorage units on the drive platter.\n\n580\n00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.120\nWhen we talk about the drive platter,\nwe're talking about\n\n581\n00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.410\nnot a huge amount of real estate, it's a\nthree and a half inch disk traditionally.\n\n582\n00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.435\nIt's not very big, but the reality is,\nwe're talking about stacks of them.\n\n583\n00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:49.955\nAnd when we talk about a single byte of\ninformation, which is incredibly small\n\n584\n00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:53.865\nby comparison to the amount of storage\nspace we have, we're talking about having\n\n585\n00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:57.685\nto break things down into very small\nunits, to be able to track storage.\n\n586\n00:26:57.685 --> 00:26:59.910\nSo sectors are those units.\n\n587\n00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.440\nWe want to make sure we're aware of that,\n\n588\n00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.100\n512 bytes of data traditionally\nare put into a sector.\n\n589\n00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.180\nThere's a few additional bytes in there\nfor drive control, error correction,\n\n590\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.080\nstuff like that.\n\n591\n00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.310\nBut we traditionally assume\nit's a 512 byte solution.\n\n592\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.760\nSo we want to just think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n593\n00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.480\nWhen we talk about a cluster,\n\n594\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.440\na cluster is the smallest\nallocation unit of the hard drive.\n\n595\n00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.780\nIt brings together a set of tracks and\nsectors, and\n\n596\n00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.380\ngroups them in such a way that\nwe can then refer to them.\n\n597\n00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.448\nTypically, anywhere from 2 to 32 of these\nare grouped together to form a cluster.\n\n598\n00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:35.600\nThey're usually 4 kilobytes in size,\nso usually 4,096 bytes,\n\n599\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.120\n4 kilobytes approximately, but it depends\non the size of the disk partition.\n\n600\n00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.700\nSome partitions are small,\nand, as a result,\n\n601\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.500\nthe sector, rather the cluster will be\nsmall as a result because the allocation\n\n602\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.190\nunit is gonna be adjusted based on\nthe size of the overall partition.\n\n603\n00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.725\nWe'll give you a little\ntable that talks about that\n\n604\n00:27:51.725 --> 00:27:53.305\nin one of the upcoming conversations.\n\n605\n00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:55.815\nBut we may have something\nup to 4 kilobytes in size,\n\n606\n00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:57.596\nsomething as small as 512 bytes.\n\n607\n00:27:57.596 --> 00:28:00.735\nWe may actually vary depending on\nthe size of the partition overall.\n\n608\n00:28:00.735 --> 00:28:04.705\nSo, that part is gonna be just\nreally be dependent on what we do.\n\n609\n00:28:04.705 --> 00:28:09.560\nAnd when we do advance formatting, we're\ngonna use, as I've said, multiple groups\n\n610\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.910\nof sectors together to equal up to\nthe 4,096 byte, or 4K allocation unit that\n\n611\n00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.270\nwe typically call a cluster as,\nor we recognize a cluster as.\n\n612\n00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.970\nSo just be aware of that,\nkeeping in mind that if\n\n613\n00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:26.010\nthe sector is the smallest allocation\nunit, typically 512 bytes, or\n\n614\n00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.680\nsmallest size for storage rather, and\nthen we group them into a cluster.\n\n615\n00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.673\nBut if the size of an individual\nsector is 512 bytes,\n\n616\n00:28:32.673 --> 00:28:36.188\nwhat do we do when we have a file\nthat's bigger than 512 bytes?\n\n617\n00:28:36.188 --> 00:28:39.799\nLet's say we have a file\nthat is 900 bytes in size.\n\n618\n00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:41.587\n&gt;&gt; I would assume it has\nto write to another sector.\n\n619\n00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:43.096\n&gt;&gt; It has to be in multiple sectors.\n\n620\n00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:46.769\nSo this is where we get into the idea of\ncontiguous storage, this is why it's so\n\n621\n00:28:46.769 --> 00:28:47.391\nimportant.\n\n622\n00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:51.803\nBecause, we can only put, let's say,\na certain amount of data inside a box.\n\n623\n00:28:51.803 --> 00:28:54.923\nAnd if that box is 512 bytes in size,\nand we have more data,\n\n624\n00:28:54.923 --> 00:28:58.910\nwe need multiple boxes kind of lined up,\nif you think about it normally.\n\n625\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.250\nAnd so if we had a 900 byte file,\nallocation size is 512,\n\n626\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.470\nwe would need 2 sectors.\n\n627\n00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.280\nEven though we may not fully utilize both,\nwe need two.\n\n628\n00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.750\nAnd we wanna try to make them contiguous,\nwanna try to put them together, because\n\n629\n00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.340\nif we keep them together it's easier to\nread and write, and know where they are.\n\n630\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.510\nIt's less work and less concern for\nus about tracking data.\n\n631\n00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.120\nBut is it always possible to\nwrite contiguously to the drive?\n\n632\n00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.130\nIt's not always.\n\n633\n00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.900\nIn the case like this where we're\ncreating as file, usually yeah,\n\n634\n00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.290\nthere's gonna be two contiguous blocks.\n\n635\n00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.210\nWe'll just do that.\n\n636\n00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.820\nOr two contiguous sectors, rather.\n\n637\n00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.270\nBut, reality is that sometimes we're\nnot able to put stuff contiguously, and\n\n638\n00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.030\nas a result stuff gets scattered.\n\n639\n00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.930\nThis is where we get\ninto fragmentation and\n\n640\n00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.160\nconcerns about how the drive is set up,\nand how to optimize access to the drive.\n\n641\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.320\nThis is beyond the conversation\nwe're having here.\n\n642\n00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.440\nThis is more about things like A+,\nand hardware management, and\n\n643\n00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.100\noptimization of storage.\n\n644\n00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.465\nThere's other episodes, other shows,\nother themes, that you may wanna look\n\n645\n00:29:52.465 --> 00:29:55.355\na little more deeply into,\nto get into some of that stuff.\n\n646\n00:29:55.355 --> 00:29:58.025\nBut just try to link some of\nthose concepts back here for\n\n647\n00:29:58.025 --> 00:30:02.125\nyou as we talk about this cuz this is\nwhere, kind of at the foundation level,\n\n648\n00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.825\nright, at the base level\nof the hard drive.\n\n649\n00:30:03.825 --> 00:30:05.195\nThis is where all of\nthis stuff comes from.\n\n650\n00:30:05.195 --> 00:30:08.675\nThis is where kinda all these themes,\nand these ideas emerge, and\n\n651\n00:30:08.675 --> 00:30:10.705\nwe wanna just make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n652\n00:30:10.705 --> 00:30:15.500\nThe other concept, just quickly as we\nfinish up our conversation around basic\n\n653\n00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:20.050\ndrive, set up the geometry, the thought\nprocess, the architecture, is slack space.\n\n654\n00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.370\nYou remember the movie Slackers?\n\n655\n00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You remember Slackers?\n\n656\n00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:23.870\nSo slack space, right?\n\n657\n00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.454\nThe idea that there's free space on\nthe cluster after we write data into that\n\n658\n00:30:27.454 --> 00:30:28.280\ncluster.\n\n659\n00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.731\nAgain, we may not used all\nthe allocated space, right?\n\n660\n00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:36.108\n512 bytes per sector, 900 byte file\nwe're not quite using everything.\n\n661\n00:30:36.108 --> 00:30:39.350\nThere's a little bit of room left over,\nessentially empty space.\n\n662\n00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.500\nWe call it slack space.\n\n663\n00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.520\nAnd as a result of that, the unused\narea remains reserved for the file.\n\n664\n00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.256\nSo we take the full allocation of two\nsectors, would be what, 1,024 right?\n\n665\n00:30:51.256 --> 00:30:53.233\nSo we would have 1,024.\n\n666\n00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:57.075\nIt's amazing how we did that on the fly,\nwith only two hands and ten fingers.\n\n667\n00:30:57.075 --> 00:30:58.860\nYou can't see it, but I also used my toes.\n\n668\n00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when we think about that,\n\n669\n00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:06.565\nif we only use 900 bytes of the 1024,\nwe've got 124 bytes leftover.\n\n670\n00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:09.555\nWe're allocating the full\namount of that to the file,\n\n671\n00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:12.515\neven though we're not using it all, and\nthat's where we start to get slacks space.\n\n672\n00:31:12.515 --> 00:31:16.105\nBecause we start getting empty space\nat the end of the allocation units,\n\n673\n00:31:16.105 --> 00:31:20.820\nand we then actually as result,\ncan start not only tracking that,\n\n674\n00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.790\nfrom a forensic's standpoint,\n\n675\n00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.570\nit's important to know it's there,\nbut a bad actor can start to use that.\n\n676\n00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.770\nWe have special tools that will find slack\nspace or white space in the drives, and\n\n677\n00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.110\nwill stuff information in there, hiding\nit so that we don't know it's there.\n\n678\n00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.700\nAnd then we can go back and\ntry to discern that as a CHFI and\n\n679\n00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.760\nstitch together that data.\n\n680\n00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.437\nSo, it's kind of interesting that we can,\nobviously based on the mechanics of how\n\n681\n00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:45.536\na drive is structured, and\nknowing that we allocate the full amount,\n\n682\n00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:48.843\neven though we don't write to it, and\nwe mark it as being used for the file,\n\n683\n00:31:48.843 --> 00:31:51.550\nthat we quote unquote say it's used and\nit's stored.\n\n684\n00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.770\nThe reality is we know there's room there.\n\n685\n00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.980\nAnd being a bad actor, looking to hide\ndata, we may be able to take that and\n\n686\n00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.990\nuse that to our advantage.\n\n687\n00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.930\nSo it's kind of an interesting concept,\nwhich is what slack space represents.\n\n688\n00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Well a lot of really good information\nhere, it was a great primer to remind us\n\n689\n00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.630\non some concepts of information we\nmight need to know foundationally for\n\n690\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.250\nmoving forward doing\nforensics on drives and\n\n691\n00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.860\nfile systems that we're going\nto get into in later episodes.\n\n692\n00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.860\nAdam we thank you for that, but it looks\nlike our time has expired for today.\n\n693\n00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.370\nAnd we do thank you guys for\nwatching, hopefully, we'll see you.\n\n694\n00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.950\nWe definitely got a part two coming.\n\n695\n00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.240\nDon't think this is the end of\nhard drives and file systems.\n\n696\n00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.910\nIt's not.\n\n697\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.110\nPart two's on its way.\n\n698\n00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.150\nThat being said, thanks for\n\n699\n00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.230\nwatching, we're signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your

00:00:12.229\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.933\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.160\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.450\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.850\nwell it's more on our CHFI series,\nI now you've been enjoying it.\n\n8\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.180\nHopefully you have, anyway.\n\n9\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.477\nCuz joining us back again for\n\n10\n00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:29.298\nanother dose of that action is\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:30.360\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.079\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.839\n&gt;&gt; A dose.\n\n14\n00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.760\nA dose.\nA dose.\n\n15\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.545\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n17\n00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:35.584\nDuet.\n\n18\n00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:36.492\n&gt;&gt; Part two.\n\n19\n00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:37.248\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here we are.\n\n20\n00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is going well and continues to.\n\n21\n00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:43.380\nSo we're gonna continue, speaking of\nmovies, which we were not speaking about,\n\n22\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.340\nbut I'm gonna just have a random\nassignment in the beginning so\n\n23\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.360\nwe get it out of the way.\n\n24\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.280\nSo yeah, we were talking about\nmovies in the last episode.\n\n25\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.880\nWe were talking about Office Space and\nSlackers.\n\n26\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.530\nYou remember Johnny Mnemonic?\n\n27\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.790\n&gt;&gt; I do remember Johnny Mnemonic.\n\n28\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.401\n&gt;&gt; That cinemographic masterpiece\nthat Keanu Reeves was involved with,\n\n29\n00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.787\nas all his work is\n&gt;&gt; I don't know\n\n30\n00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:59.106\nhow it didn't win a bunch of Oscars.\n\n31\n00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.418\nBecause he was so awesome.\n\n32\n00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:01.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.180\nHe made up for The Matrix, but boy,\nwere there some stinkers early on.\n\n34\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.820\nBut if you remember Johnny Mnemonic,\n\n35\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.720\nanother interesting one out of the bin\nof has-been movies from days gone by,\n\n36\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.850\nit would be a cool one for\nyou to watch as well.\n\n37\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.770\nThe concept is basically\nhe's a transporter,\n\n38\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.355\nexcept not as cool as Jason Statham and\ndoesn't have the kind of moves he does.\n\n39\n00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:21.920\nBut in the future and\n\n40\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080\nhe's using his head as the hard\ndrive to transport information.\n\n41\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.100\nAnd he has to put a certain amount\nof information in there and\n\n42\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.460\nhas to get a memory upgrade to do that,\nwhole nine yards.\n\n43\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460\nIt's kind of interesting movies.\n\n44\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.370\nShades of Minority Report but\nwithout the eyeballs.\n\n45\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:40.036\n&gt;&gt; Which actually I saw it this weekend,\nit was on this weekend, til the end of it.\n\n47\n00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:43.574\nI always, no matter when I catch this\nmovie, it's one of these things,\n\n48\n00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:46.938\nwhenever I watch A Few Good Men,\nI always, no matter when I see it on,\n\n49\n00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:50.592\nif I just happen to turn it on, I flip\naround and I find it, I always turn it on\n\n50\n00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:54.370\nright at the end in the courtroom scene-\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n51\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Where him and Kevin Bacon is the\nprosecutor and Tom Cruise are going at it,\n\n52\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880\nand I manage to catch that same scene\nright as they put Jack up on the stand.\n\n53\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.140\nJust feel like that no matter,\nI could be anywhere in the world.\n\n54\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.840\n&gt;&gt; You have never seen any\nother part of that movie-\n\n55\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.060\n&gt;&gt; I only see that five minute\n\n56\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.320\nsection again and again but\nthat is just part of the whole movie.\n\n57\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.240\nYou can't handle the truth,\nand then whenever I see.\n\n58\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.320\nWhat was the other one I\nwas just about to tell you?\n\n59\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.726\nWhenever I see Minority Report,\nright, I don't see this often but\n\n60\n00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.680\nwhenever I see it,\nI always get the same part again.\n\n61\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.501\nBut it's the part with the whole,\nwithout being a spoiler, but\n\n62\n00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:31.347\nit's the whole thing with the baggie.\n\n63\n00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let me get in there and\n\n64\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.300\nI managed to get that part.\n\n65\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.020\nBut it's hilarious when things\nare just like rolling down.\n\n66\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.760\nHe goes to put it up and it's my god,\n\n67\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.660\nand they're rolling down the thing and\nthey fall.\n\n68\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.050\nIt's the funniest part.\n\n69\n00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.310\nAnyway, so I digress.\n\n70\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.240\nSo we're here to talk about\nsomething other than movies,\n\n71\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.990\nalthough we could do a whole episode just\non old movies and like movie trivia.\n\n72\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.786\n&gt;&gt; Don't threaten me with a good time.\n\n73\n00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.762\n&gt;&gt; It would be like\nthe 80s commercial vault.\n\n74\n00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:56.297\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n75\n00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:58.218\n&gt;&gt; Only it would be 80s\nmovies with commercials.\n\n76\n00:02:58.218 --> 00:02:58.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm down.\n\n77\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.890\nWe'll talk to the higher ups.\n\n78\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.205\n&gt;&gt; We should think about that.\n\n79\n00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:02.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We could just do that off the cuff.\n\n80\n00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We don't even need show notes.\n\n81\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.570\nBetween what you and I've seen,\nand what you're tastes are, and\n\n82\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.252\nprobably that stuff,\nit's a heck of a show.\n\n83\n00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:10.960\nAll right, anyway let's talk about\nsomething more important like stuff you're\n\n84\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.882\nactually here to learn about.\n\n85\n00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:14.980\nAll right, so building on what we\ntalked about in our last episode,\n\n86\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.240\nI want to continue talking a little bit\nabout hard drives and disk data access and\n\n87\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.260\nhow we do that.\n\n88\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.250\nWe talked about the concepts,\nthe structure, the thought process,\n\n89\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.960\nthe platter, the sector,\nthe tracks, how we do all that.\n\n90\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.060\nThe cylinders, but\n\n91\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.460\nwe didn't really talk about the ways\nwe actually do the addressing.\n\n92\n00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.460\nWe just talked about, hey,\nlet's put data there,\n\n93\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.840\nbut we didn't really talk about what\nputting it there actually means.\n\n94\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.930\nWe have two ways that we deal\nwith disk data addressing.\n\n95\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.270\nWe have what's known as Cylinder Head\nSector addressing, it's called CHS, and\n\n96\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.630\nwe have Logical Block Addressing, LBA.\n\n97\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.910\nCHS is used on older technology,\n\n98\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.550\ntypically IDE drives used a Cylinder\nHead Sector just like the name implies.\n\n99\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.130\nWe simply address or\nspecify the cylinder, the head,\n\n100\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.390\nand the sector positions as a combination\nof those to figure out where data is.\n\n101\n00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.910\nThe cylinder is referred to as the radius.\n\n102\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.300\nThe head is referred to\nas the platter side.\n\n103\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.130\nAnd the sector, which is the angular\nposition in that triumphrant.\n\n104\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.660\nThose three things together\nare the data points that we use for\n\n105\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.530\nCylinder Head Sector addressing.\n\n106\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.188\nLogical Block Addressing is used\non SCSI and enhanced IDE drive, so\n\n107\n00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:22.110\nEIDE and SCSI drives.\n\n108\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.190\nWe'll use LBA or Logical Block Addressing.\n\n109\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.380\nWe allocate sequential numbers to\neach sector on the hard drive and\n\n110\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.020\nwe then are able to go ahead and\ntrack through those sequential numbers.\n\n111\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.831\nA little bit more common, with regards\nto LBA than the CHS that we hear about.\n\n112\n00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.930\nSo, just thought I'd throw\nthose out there for you.\n\n113\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.575\nWhat I'll actually show you, interact with\nyou, it's a little demo on how we take\n\n114\n00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.585\nall the information we've been discussing\nand how we calculate drive space.\n\n115\n00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:50.105\nWe often hear that a drive\nis a terabyte in size or\n\n116\n00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:53.560\na drive will store 500\ngigabytes of information.\n\n117\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.460\nBut other than somebody telling us that,\n\n118\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.890\na vendor labeling it,\nhow do we really know that?\n\n119\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.790\nIn other words, when somebody says to you,\n500 gigs of data can be stored there,\n\n120\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.920\nhow do you know?\n\n121\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.719\nI mean, you could put 500 gigs worth of\nstuff in there in theory and test it,\n\n122\n00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:07.255\nright?\n\n123\n00:05:07.255 --> 00:05:10.265\nBut would you know you got to 500 and\nwhen you did,\n\n124\n00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:12.605\nwould you know that you\nwere able to go past it?\n\n125\n00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:15.364\nI'm going to show you the mathematical\ncalculation we actually use to\n\n126\n00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:16.075\nfigure that out.\n\n127\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:18.482\nI thought it would be cool to\nkind of walk you through that and\n\n128\n00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:20.660\ntake the moving parts and\nexplain to you how it works.\n\n129\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.580\nSo, can we go to my machine here,\nfor a minute.\n\n130\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.690\nCan we go full size just so we could or\nmake it just a little bit bigger.\n\n131\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.970\nSo what we're going to do,\nthis very simple tool here, right?\n\n132\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.110\nThis is the most complicated forensics\ntool that you're ever going to\n\n133\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.780\nhave to operate.\n\n134\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.774\nIt's called the Windows Calculator.\n\n135\n00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:33.792\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n136\n00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.090\nAnd so, we're just going to use\nthe calculator, really simple.\n\n137\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.518\nI'm just going to punch some numbers in.\n\n138\n00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:42.120\nI'm going to talk to you about the numbers\nand go through them really quickly.\n\n139\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.298\nDo you actually have, in our show notes,\nthe little primer on the number there?\n\n140\n00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:46.906\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is there, yes.\n\n141\n00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:48.857\n&gt;&gt; Could you read them to\nme while I'm doing this?\n\n142\n00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:49.378\n&gt;&gt; Surely.\n\n143\n00:05:49.378 --> 00:05:51.226\n&gt;&gt; That way I can just,\ninstead of having to keep an eye on them,\n\n144\n00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.954\nyou can kind of feed them to me and\nI'll do it real quick.\n\n145\n00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:53.780\n&gt;&gt; No problem, all right.\n\n146\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.507\n&gt;&gt; The disk drive has so many cylinders,\nthat whole thing, right?\n\n147\n00:05:55.507 --> 00:05:56.080\n&gt;&gt; We're good to go.\n\n148\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.860\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel's going to help me out here.\n\n149\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.800\nWhat we've done is I've just\nbroken down a little how\n\n150\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.870\ndo I calculate disk space problem.\n\n151\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.980\nWe've put it in the show notes, so\n\n152\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.510\nit's literally going to be\nthe numbers I'm gonna do with you.\n\n153\n00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.655\nBut he's gonna read them to me so\nI can just put them in and\n\n154\n00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.105\nthen we'll kind of narrate as we go.\n\n155\n00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:12.352\nAll right, so then we're going to\nstart with the number of cylinders on\n\n156\n00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:13.100\nthe disk, correct?\n\n157\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.690\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n158\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.048\nThe number of cylinders\non the disk is 18,121.\n\n159\n00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:21.846\n&gt;&gt; 18,121, so we're going to take\nthe number of cylinders that are on\n\n160\n00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:24.233\nthe disk drive,\nwe're going to put those in,\n\n161\n00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:27.810\nwe're going to multiply all of\nthese numbers together, by the way.\n\n162\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.980\nSo we're just going to put them in,\nhit our little multiplication sign.\n\n163\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.214\nAl, what's our next number up?\n\n164\n00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:34.413\n&gt;&gt; Our next number is for\nthe heads and they are 70.\n\n165\n00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:37.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the number of heads per\ncylinder, right, and that's gonna be 70.\n\n166\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.580\nSo we're going to do that.\n\n167\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.720\nMultiply that.\n\n168\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.675\nAnd again, we're not going to\nworry about the interim values.\n\n169\n00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.076\nYou'll see them building on the screen.\n\n170\n00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:45.510\nWhat we want is what is the ultimate\nvalue at the end of the little\n\n171\n00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.440\nexample we're gonna get.\n\n172\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.740\nThat's gonna then be the amount of\nactual bytes that we can store data.\n\n173\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.133\nAnd then we just convert that, right?\n\n174\n00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:55.823\nOn sale, there's a 27 billion, we have\na 27 gigabyte, or terabyte drive or\n\n175\n00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:56.380\nwhatever.\n\n176\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.810\nAll right, so\nwe did number of cylinders per disk,\n\n177\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.610\nnumber of heads per cylinder, what else?\n\n178\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.420\n&gt;&gt; We are now onto sectors\nper track which is 43.\n\n179\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.073\n&gt;&gt; Sectors per track which is 43.\n\n180\n00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:07.590\nSo number of sectors per track.\n\n181\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.924\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n182\n00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:12.690\nThat's gonna be that, okay?\n\n183\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.520\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen the last one is 512 bytes per sector.\n\n184\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.257\n&gt;&gt; So number of bytes per\nsector in other words, right.\n\n185\n00:07:17.257 --> 00:07:20.700\nWhich is 512 as we said standard for that.\n\n186\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.206\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n187\n00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:25.410\nAnd then that is going to equal whatever\nthat number happens to wind up being.\n\n188\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.412\nI think that's what,\n\n189\n00:07:28.412 --> 00:07:33.945\n27,926,635,520 Bytes.\n\n190\n00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:38.193\nAnd, so that's the amount of space,\nthe actual amount of data,\n\n191\n00:07:38.193 --> 00:07:41.530\nthat can be stored in the byte count for\nthis drive.\n\n192\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.198\nThis drive, in other words,\nif we did the math,\n\n193\n00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.598\nwould be able to store almost\n28 gigabytes of data, right?\n\n194\n00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:50.559\nApproximately, unless you round up,\nit's about 28 gigabytes of data.\n\n195\n00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:52.417\nSmall drive, not too big obviously.\n\n196\n00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:56.361\nBut the point is that this is how we\nwould actually figure out the number or\n\n197\n00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:57.524\nthe amount of bytes,\n\n198\n00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:01.180\nand ultimately the carrying capacity or\nthe size of the drive.\n\n199\n00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.700\nWe would multiply the number of cylinders\nper disk, the number of heads per\n\n200\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.620\ncylinder, the number of sectors per track\nand the amount of bytes per sector.\n\n201\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.490\nTake all that, throw it in a blender, add\nin just a little bit of love and a little\n\n202\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.060\nbit of IT security and a dash of ITPRO.TV\nfor good measure, and what do we get?\n\n203\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.100\nWe get almost 28 gigabytes of data,\nin terms of the storage capacity, or\n\n204\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.600\nthe running size of the drive.\n\n205\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.470\nSo if you ever have to\ncalculate the size of a drive,\n\n206\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.670\nthis is how you would actually do it.\n\n207\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.760\nYou'd have to get all those numbers and\nthen you would multiply them out.\n\n208\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.023\nNow, where do you get those numbers?\n\n209\n00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:37.760\nWell, the manufacturer of the drive\nhas provided that information to you.\n\n210\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.400\nNow, are they typically\non the back of the drive?\n\n211\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.470\nThey're not normally on\nthe back of the drive.\n\n212\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.940\nYou can go and look a drive up.\n\n213\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:49.020\nFigure out I have a Seagate\nmodel 22057 SATA drive.\n\n214\n00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.830\nYou go look it up online, and\nyou could read the numbers and\n\n215\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.810\nthe information from the vendor, and\nyou can then actually figure it out.\n\n216\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.660\nThey've done the math for\n\n217\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.590\nyou and said, well, this drive\nholds this amount of information.\n\n218\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.210\nBut if you actually go through and take\na look at the technical documentation,\n\n219\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.080\nyou're gonna see a breakdown\nof all these numbers in there.\n\n220\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.570\nAnd they're gonna actually then show you,\nthis many sectors, this many things, blah,\n\n221\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.690\nblah, blah, and you could actually do\nthe math yourself and break it down.\n\n222\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.220\nSo it's just kind of interesting when\nyou look at all the mechanics of it,\n\n223\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.980\nthe mathematics of it, if you will.\n\n224\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.760\nAnd the funny part is,\n\n225\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.900\nI don't like to use the word hate\nbecause I think it's a very strong word.\n\n226\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.479\nAnd words, you have to really\nrespect the power of language.\n\n227\n00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.850\nAnd I don't like to use the word hate.\n\n228\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.390\nBut, it's a word that I reserve for\nvery few things.\n\n229\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.110\nAnd I don't mean this\nnegatively when I say it,\n\n230\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.950\nbut I was never good at math as a kid.\n\n231\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.240\nI'm still not that great\nat it as an adult.\n\n232\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.110\nOn a good day,\nI could get 2 plus 2 to maybe equal 3,\n\n233\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.310\nif I stretch, maybe occasionally 4.\n\n234\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.730\nBut it's just,\nit's not one of my strong suits.\n\n235\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.610\nAnd you know, it's funny, because I had to\ndo a lot of math in school, as we all do.\n\n236\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.360\nI did all the basic sciences.\n\n237\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.520\nI did physics, I did chemistry,\nI did biology, I did algebra and I\n\n238\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.050\ndidn't do trigonometry because I probably\nwould have hung myself from a tree.\n\n239\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.340\nBut you know I did all of the basic and\n\n240\n00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.390\nsome of the advance math\nto get through school.\n\n241\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.520\nAnd I just am not wired that way.\n\n242\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.185\nYou know how certain people,\nthat's just what they're wired to do?\n\n243\n00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:08.015\nI'm not one of those people,\nI really struggle with it.\n\n244\n00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:08.925\n&gt;&gt; I'll see you at the meeting.\n\n245\n00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:09.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n246\n00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:12.115\nThe first step is admitting\nyou have a problem.\n\n247\n00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:12.705\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n248\n00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:17.395\nso, I found that as an adult\nin my chosen career field,\n\n249\n00:10:17.395 --> 00:10:21.535\nin what I do, in IT and security, the\nthings that I am fortunate enough to be\n\n250\n00:10:21.535 --> 00:10:23.965\ninvited from time to time to\nspend time talking to you about.\n\n251\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.440\nWhile I have to do a lot of stuff that\nyou would think heavily involves math,\n\n252\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.430\nit's one those fallacies of what we do.\n\n253\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.960\nYou don't really need to\nknow much about math, and\n\n254\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.800\nhow the mathematics of the things\naround us work, to be good at IT,\n\n255\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.650\nto be able to do security,\ndo the things we do.\n\n256\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.140\nLot of people, I talk to younger\npeople starting out in our field,\n\n257\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.610\nand they say all the time, my God, I'm\ngonna get a degree in MIS or something.\n\n258\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.400\nI gotta study all this math.\n\n259\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.350\nBut the reality is you just don't\nuse it that often for what we do.\n\n260\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.230\nYes, don't get me wrong, you need math,\nI'm not suggesting you don't.\n\n261\n00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.580\nAnd by the way, I'm not saying math is\nnot important, it's very important.\n\n262\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.645\nI'm just pointing out that some of\nthe stuff we just did, this baby, the most\n\n263\n00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:06.825\ncomplicated math you ever actually have\nto do, doing what we do for a living.\n\n264\n00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:09.405\nBecause most of it is already\npreconfigured for you today,\n\n265\n00:11:09.405 --> 00:11:10.915\nthat's just the reality of it.\n\n266\n00:11:10.915 --> 00:11:12.605\nNobody says to you, here's a hard drive,\n\n267\n00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.690\nfigure out how much data\nyou could store on it.\n\n268\n00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.180\nAnd by the way, here's the prerequisite\nnumbers that form the inputs.\n\n269\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.560\nCome back and tell us what you're got.\n\n270\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.287\nThey just give you a drive that has\na label slapped on it that says yeah,\n\n271\n00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:23.730\n500 gigabytes and you're done.\n\n272\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.570\n&gt;&gt; You know it's funny.\n\n273\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.530\nI saw a meme just yesterday that said,\nremember when our teachers told us,\n\n274\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.644\nwell you think you're gonna have\na calculator everywhere you go?\n\n275\n00:11:30.644 --> 00:11:31.749\nWell, we sure showed them.\n\n276\n00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:34.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes we do.\n\n277\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Think about it, I mean,\n\n278\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.630\nlisten, I can do subnetting and all that\nkind of stuff with the best of them, and\n\n279\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.210\nI can do it in my head, and\nI do it often enough I know how to do it.\n\n280\n00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.460\nAnd that's complicated math,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n281\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.310\nI mean, some of that stuff can get\nreally involved, raising two to a power,\n\n282\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.820\nfigure something out, number of bites,\nwhatever, that's a lot of stuff.\n\n283\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.190\nBut the reality is, as Daniel pointed out,\nas much as I hate to say it,\n\n284\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.285\nwe have an app for that.\n\n285\n00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:01.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly\n&gt;&gt; So we walk around with one everywhere.\n\n286\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:07.870\nKids today, I mean, thankfully my\ngirls relatively good with math.\n\n287\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.850\nMy older one, especially.\n\n288\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.150\nShe didn't get it from me or her mother,\ncuz neither of us are very good with math.\n\n289\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.810\nBut she's actually really,\nreally good with math, and it's just,\n\n290\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:17.660\nit's one of those things.\n\n291\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.150\nYou walk around in it in your head,\nor it's just like Greek.\n\n292\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And the funny part is,\n\n293\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.650\nI can actually do the Greek alphabet\nstanding in one foot with my eyes closed.\n\n294\n00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.409\n&gt;&gt; I can actually read [INAUDIBLE] Greek.\n\n295\n00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:28.735\n&gt;&gt; Well, I-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:12:28.735 --> 00:12:29.817\n&gt;&gt; l pledged to a fraternity when I was\n\n297\n00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:30.582\nyounger and stupider.\n\n298\n00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And so one of\nthe things that you had to learn was,\n\n299\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.120\nto this day I still remember\nthe Greek alphabet.\n\n300\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.360\nSo I can do that.\n\n301\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.230\nI can't do a square root, but\nI can do the Greek alphabet.\n\n302\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.758\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n303\n00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.638\n&gt;&gt; So it's amazing what you feel is\nimportant, and what you focus on, and\n\n304\n00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.530\nthen what becomes minutia and\nyou just make room for other stuff.\n\n305\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.820\nSo speaking of making room for\nstuff, disk partitions.\n\n306\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.360\nHow do we make room for things?\n\n307\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.580\nWe're gonna carve up, we're going to\nallocate space, creating partitions.\n\n308\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.570\nWe create logical divisions on\nthe hard drive, allowing us to then\n\n309\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:02.290\nstore operating specific system, and,\nor data information within them.\n\n310\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.660\nTwo kinds of partitions,\nprimary and, or, extended.\n\n311\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.810\nI'm sure most of us\nare familiar with those.\n\n312\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.600\nWe don't often think of them and\nrefer to them that way.\n\n313\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.350\nWhat do we call partitions?\n\n314\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.280\nC drive, F drive, X drive, whatever it is.\n\n315\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.020\nCause we often think of drive letters\nas being how we associate storage and\n\n316\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.450\ninformation management, but the reality\nis we're talking about partitions.\n\n317\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.800\nIf it's a primary partition,\n\n318\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.440\nthis is where the operating\nsystem information is stored.\n\n319\n00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.030\nIf it's an extended partition,\n\n320\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.970\nthis is a logical drive within\nthe physical partition that we've created.\n\n321\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.670\nThat allows us to store\ndata traditionally separate\n\n322\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.020\nfrom the operating\nsystem files themselves.\n\n323\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.220\nPeople often ask hey, can I put\ndata inside the primary partition,\n\n324\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.270\nother than the operating system files?\n\n325\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.591\nAbsolutely.\nA lot of us just have a single drive,\n\n326\n00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:51.250\na single partition, rather, one physical\ndrive, and then a single partition on it.\n\n327\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.730\nAnd we just put our operating system and\neverything else into the C drive or\n\n328\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.030\nwhatever it may be, and\nwe store everything in one place.\n\n329\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.410\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n330\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.130\nBut a lot of times we'll also create\nseparate partitions either on the same\n\n331\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.600\nphysical drive or\non different physical drives,\n\n332\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.130\nif there's more than one in a system.\n\n333\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.890\nAnd we'll be able to then\nallocate drive letters to them\n\n334\n00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.070\nto be able to recognize them,\ninteract with them.\n\n335\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.350\nThat's how the operating system\nactually interacts with the partition,\n\n336\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.185\nmounts it, loads it, makes it available\ninside the GUI, whatever that may be.\n\n337\n00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n338\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.465\nYou know, I'm still waiting for\nthe day when A and B will be released.\n\n339\n00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:28.250\nBecause we no longer need A,\nbecause we just don't use floppies,\n\n340\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.580\nalmost without exception,\nwe don't use floppies any more.\n\n341\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.860\nAnd we don't use the B\ndrive traditionally either,\n\n342\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.700\nbecause that was also\ntypically reserved for floppy.\n\n343\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.376\nSo you know you normally start with the C.\n\n344\n00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:42.200\nAnd D or E is normally taken up by the CD\nROM, or whatever you may have in there.\n\n345\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.160\nSo you normally see C, and then you\njump to like F or something like that.\n\n346\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.040\nI mean, if you think about it,\nA and B are just orphaned and\n\n347\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.360\njust sitting around, it's like they\ngot the short end of the negotiation.\n\n348\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.920\nWhen everybody sat around and said okay,\nthis is what you're going to do.\n\n349\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.980\nOkay, you guys are going\nto be reserved and\n\n350\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.630\nnobody's ever going to use you ever again,\nstarting in 1972 forward.\n\n351\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.770\nThat's it.\nYou're done.\n\n352\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.200\nSo you've got a long vacation and\nabsolutely nothing to do.\n\n353\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.880\nAnd if you think about it,\nwe could actually get them back.\n\n354\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.980\nit's interesting as to why we don't.\n\n355\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.760\nIf you think about the logic of how\noperating systems are built today,\n\n356\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.440\nwe have backwards compatibility.\n\n357\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.730\nWe call this interoperability,\ngenerically.\n\n358\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.390\nWe still maintain their operability for\nthose systems,\n\n359\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.450\neven though we don't\nreally use them anymore.\n\n360\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.350\nWe'd have to rewrite the stack\nin the operating system,\n\n361\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.670\nto be able to allocate A and\nB to a different drive out of the box.\n\n362\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.690\nNot that we couldn't use them,\nbut the reality is that,\n\n363\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.390\nnormally they're allocated.\n\n364\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.820\nIn most operating systems, we assumed\nthat they would be allocated for\n\n365\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.710\na floppy drive.\n\n366\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.060\nSo that's why we don't\ntraditionally see them being used.\n\n367\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.777\nJust kind of interesting\nwhen you think about it.\n\n368\n00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:46.159\nEventually at some point,\nlike a 1,000 years from now,\n\n369\n00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:47.796\nthey won't be used anymore.\n\n370\n00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:49.539\nBut then again they said DOS\nwould go away and, you know.\n\n371\n00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:50.163\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's still here.\n\n372\n00:15:50.163 --> 00:15:51.654\n&gt;&gt; You see how that happened, right?\n\n373\n00:15:51.654 --> 00:15:54.051\nHe has one hell of an agent,\nthat DOS guy, right.\n\n374\n00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:56.115\nYou're gonna be around forever,\nI promise you.\n\n375\n00:15:56.115 --> 00:15:58.530\nPeople are gonna be\ntalking about you forever.\n\n376\n00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.719\nOkay.\n\n377\n00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:02.436\nAll right, so disk partitions,\nmake sure you understand what they are.\n\n378\n00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:06.738\nAlong with disk partitions, I mentioned\nto Daniel before we came on for\n\n379\n00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:10.048\nour discussions this morning,\nan oldie but a goodie.\n\n380\n00:16:10.048 --> 00:16:11.618\nWe were talking about\nthe master boot record.\n\n381\n00:16:11.618 --> 00:16:14.080\nAnd Daniel looked at me and\nwent, what's that?\n\n382\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.572\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n383\n00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:17.990\nBut, no, he didn't do that,\nhe knew what the master boot record was.\n\n384\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.403\nBut the master boot record's, again,\n\n385\n00:16:19.403 --> 00:16:21.190\nsomething you don't often\nhear people talk about.\n\n386\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.470\nI mean when, was the last time\nyou sat down with somebody and\n\n387\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.160\ntalked about the MBR?\n\n388\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.170\nTalked about the fact that essentially,\nthe first sector of the drive,\n\n389\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.230\nsector zero, as we say, right, for\n\n390\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.930\ndata storage on a hard drive and\nthe information that goes in there.\n\n391\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.777\nThere's a cool name for like a secret\noperative, by the way, Sector Zero.\n\n392\n00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:38.508\n&gt;&gt; Sector Zero.\n\n393\n00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:41.140\n&gt;&gt; That's got to be a cool name.\n\n394\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.565\nDid you see they're bringing\nout Assassin's Creed?\n\n395\n00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:46.641\n&gt;&gt; No?\n&gt;&gt; They're making a movie out of it.\n\n396\n00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:47.530\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n397\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.926\nI think it's coming out\nat the end of the year.\n\n398\n00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.827\n&gt;&gt; Shut up and take my money, right?\n\n399\n00:16:52.827 --> 00:16:54.534\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Seriously.\n\n400\n00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:58.074\nAnd you it looks like, I mean, if you're\nfamiliar with the game, it's obviously,\n\n401\n00:16:58.074 --> 00:17:00.927\nit's a pretty cool game, but\njust from the attractions I've seen,\n\n402\n00:17:00.927 --> 00:17:02.845\nit actually looks like\nthey did a decent job.\n\n403\n00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:06.848\nCuz you know a lot of times they'll take\nsome of that stuff and they'll just kind\n\n404\n00:17:06.848 --> 00:17:10.758\nof, well, for a lack of a better way\nof putting it, they'll just mess it up.\n\n405\n00:17:10.758 --> 00:17:12.744\nAlthough Doctor Strange,\nabsolutely awesome.\n\n406\n00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:14.170\n&gt;&gt; I've heard,\nI've heard nothing but good things.\n\n407\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:14.810\n&gt;&gt; You haven't seen it?\n\n408\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.690\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't.\n&gt;&gt; You gotta go see it.\n\n409\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:16.640\nIt's awesome, awesome.\n\n410\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.890\nThey did a really good job.\n\n411\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.630\nBut then you have something like Ant Man,\nwhich was just the exact opposite.\n\n412\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.900\nBut then again, Ant Man?\n\n413\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.650\nI mean, you know, look?\n\n414\n00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.211\nI like Marvel Comics,\nhe was a cool character, but you know,\n\n415\n00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.500\nthere's really no comparison there, right?\n\n416\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.720\nThe mirror universe and\nall the stuff with Doctor Strange.\n\n417\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.860\nHey, look, I can be this small.\n\n418\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.963\nThere's no comparison.\n\n419\n00:17:34.963 --> 00:17:36.430\nGood movie, though, you gotta go see it.\n\n420\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.796\nBut they're bringing Assassin's Creed out.\n\n421\n00:17:37.796 --> 00:17:39.720\n&gt;&gt; I can't wait to see that.\n&gt;&gt; It should be actually really cool.\n\n422\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.070\nThe concept is, he's, the guy, is now,\nthe assassin's died, obviously.\n\n423\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.675\nThey're in the future and\nthey figure out this whole thing,\n\n424\n00:17:48.675 --> 00:17:50.445\nwithout ruining the whole storyline.\n\n425\n00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:55.434\nAnd they take him back so that he could\nrelive the life of his ancestor from 500\n\n426\n00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:57.601\nyears ago as the master assassin.\n\n427\n00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:01.112\nAnd they bring those skills\ninto the future to fight evil.\n\n428\n00:18:01.112 --> 00:18:02.862\nSo it's kind of an interesting concept.\n\n429\n00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:04.792\nReally, really cool from what I've seen so\nfar.\n\n430\n00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.402\nSo you may want to just\ntake a look at that.\n\n431\n00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:08.027\nBut the master boot record, right?\n\n432\n00:18:08.027 --> 00:18:09.162\nWhat does that have to do?\n\n433\n00:18:09.162 --> 00:18:10.692\nWhat do we put in the master boot record?\n\n434\n00:18:10.692 --> 00:18:13.502\nYou remember, years ago we would\nhave to fix the MBR, right?\n\n435\n00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:16.821\nWe would have to go in and\nreset it a lot of the times.\n\n436\n00:18:16.821 --> 00:18:21.136\nIf you go back long enough to let's\nsay NT4, Windows NT4, NT 3.51,\n\n437\n00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:26.204\n3.540 days and you remember installing\noperating systems the old fashioned way,\n\n438\n00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:28.274\nby hand with floppy disks, right?\n\n439\n00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you remember doing that\n\n440\n00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:30.661\nkind of stuff.\n\n441\n00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:34.551\nA lot of times if we would take an\nexisting system, blow out the partitions,\n\n442\n00:18:34.551 --> 00:18:39.960\nand then look to reinstall, we would\nformat, and then we would go to install.\n\n443\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.730\nYou would run the NT install program.\n\n444\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.150\nAnd you may run into a problem\nwith the master boot record.\n\n445\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.910\nBecause if you didn't reset the MBR,\nessentially, and zero it out so\n\n446\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.370\nyou could then rewrite partition\ninformation to it telling the MBR or\n\n447\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.390\nthe master record, essentially,\nthe map of where stuff was on the drive,\n\n448\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.460\nhow to set itself up so\nwe knew where to store stuff.\n\n449\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.994\nYou'd get about halfway\nthrough the install of NT 4,\n\n450\n00:19:02.994 --> 00:19:06.903\nit would blue screen on you, because it\ncouldn't write its information to the MBR,\n\n451\n00:19:06.903 --> 00:19:08.350\ncuz the MBR was already set up.\n\n452\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:13.630\nSo you'd have to go in zap it with DOS,\ndo an MBR fix, zero out the MBR,\n\n453\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.120\nessentially, you know, clean it up, and\nthen reset it so you could use it again.\n\n454\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.660\nIt was kind of a, let me do that,\nwait, no, that's not gonna work.\n\n455\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.430\nYou learn the hard way.\n\n456\n00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.550\nYou did it one time, and\nthen of course, going forward,\n\n457\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.350\nyou would just know that\nyou would have to do that.\n\n458\n00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.224\nSo we would hold a partition table that\nhad the partitions of the hard drive set\n\n459\n00:19:29.224 --> 00:19:29.950\nup in the MBR.\n\n460\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.950\nThis is one of the reasons\nyou had to reset it.\n\n461\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.600\nWe would have the bootstrap\ninformation for the OS.\n\n462\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.100\nSo actually the boot information on\nwhere the partitions would be found, and\n\n463\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.280\nthe sector map for the OS.\n\n464\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.459\nSo we knew how to load the OS, the, you\nknow, the NTOS kernel or the NT loader, or\n\n465\n00:19:43.459 --> 00:19:45.360\nwhatever OS would have been.\n\n466\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.550\nAnd then also recognize\nindividual hard drive media\n\n467\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.590\nby putting a 32-bit signature onto it,\na unique signature.\n\n468\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.610\nWe still do that, by the way,\nand that is still there.\n\n469\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.807\nBut it may just be done in\na variety of different ways, right.\n\n470\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.170\nSo just think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n471\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.020\nBut the MBR is kind of\nan interesting concept.\n\n472\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.809\nNow, if you have to back up the MBR,\n\n473\n00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:08.328\nwhich when we're doing an investigation\nof the drive, we need to do,\n\n474\n00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:12.525\nbecause we have to understand the drive\ngeometry and the map for the drive, right.\n\n475\n00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:14.280\nThere's a few different\nways we can do this.\n\n476\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.910\nIn Unix and\n\n477\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.700\nLinux we were talking about this tool\ncalled dd that Daniel is fond of.\n\n478\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.543\nAnd we can use dd in Linux or Unix to\ndo a backup of the MBR, and restore it,\n\n479\n00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:27.520\nby the way, if we need to,\nif there's a problem.\n\n480\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.130\nWe've got the command lines for how to do\nthat in the show notes, sir, do we not?\n\n481\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.110\nSo I put those in there for\nyou, take a look at those.\n\n482\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.850\nWe're not gonna bother to\ngo through them with you.\n\n483\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.600\nBecause you're not really going to\nkeep track of what we're saying, look,\n\n484\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.870\nit's dd if equals blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n485\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.380\nJust take a look,\nyou'll see them in there.\n\n486\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.300\nBut if you're interested,\nyou could see how to do that.\n\n487\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.650\nYou know, in Windows,\nif we need to deal with the MBR or\n\n488\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.290\nif there's a problem with it and\nwe want to be able to address it,\n\n489\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.805\nif we go to my machine for just a second,\nthere's a cool little site, Sysint,\n\n490\n00:20:53.805 --> 00:20:58.070\nS-Y-S-I-N-T, has a tool called MBRFix.\n\n491\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.189\nYou may wanna take a look at this.\n\n492\n00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:00.410\nYou can see it right here.\n\n493\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.580\nSystem Integration is\nthe name of the site.\n\n494\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.480\nAnd if you download MBRFix.exe,\nyou'll see it will work.\n\n495\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.288\nIt says up to Windows 2008, Windows 7.\n\n496\n00:21:11.288 --> 00:21:14.640\nIt works on newer OSes as well by the way,\njust so you know.\n\n497\n00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.255\nBut you can see it's\npretty straightforward.\n\n498\n00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:19.732\nMBRFix, drive, number,\npartition, command, etc.\n\n499\n00:21:19.732 --> 00:21:23.365\nAnd you can go through, it tells you\nexactly what to do here and how to use it.\n\n500\n00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:28.017\nSo this is the equivalent tool that you\ncan use in Windows to be able to achieve\n\n501\n00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:32.905\nthe same results that we were talking\nabout with using dd in Linux and/or Unix.\n\n502\n00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:34.042\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n503\n00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.950\nSo just thought I'd show\nthat to you real quick.\n\n504\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.260\nYou can obviously play with\nthat if you're interested.\n\n505\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.880\nAnd you can see how to interact\nwith the MBR, take a sample of it,\n\n506\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.670\nthings like that.\n\n507\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.400\nWith regards to Windows overall, and\njust thinking about the files and\n\n508\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.900\nthe information that's necessary for\n\n509\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.800\nus as investigators to have\na sense of in Windows.\n\n510\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.130\nWe often talk about\nessential Windows files.\n\n511\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.890\nFiles that have to be available, that have\nto be there, that have to be working.\n\n512\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.830\nAnd that if they're not working and\nare broken, we may have to modify or fix.\n\n513\n00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.140\nSo there's a short list of them, thought\nI'd quickly just enumerate them for you.\n\n514\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.650\nI know Daniel's got them set up for us.\n\n515\n00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.430\nWe'll see them in the show notes as well.\n\n516\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:12.035\nThe ntoskrnl and the ntkrnlpa.exe,\nboth of these are .exes.\n\n517\n00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:15.589\nHal.dll, the oldie but\na goodie, right, remember?\n\n518\n00:22:15.589 --> 00:22:16.400\n&gt;&gt; Hal.\n\n519\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.259\n&gt;&gt; Space 2001, Space Odyssey, HAL?\n\n520\n00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:21.210\nNo, Dave, I'm sorry,\nwe have to kill you now.\n\n521\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.140\nLet me open the air lock.\n\n522\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you have to.\n\n523\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.296\n&gt;&gt; Talk about movies that, obviously at\nthe time, I mean, Kubrick was a genius,\n\n524\n00:22:27.296 --> 00:22:30.936\nbut at the time, you know,\ngroundbreaking for decades afterwards.\n\n525\n00:22:30.936 --> 00:22:37.680\nBut then you go and you mess it up by\ncreating a sequel that just was garbage.\n\n526\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.510\nI mean,\nsometimes you leave good enough alone.\n\n527\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.277\n&gt;&gt; You have to know when.\n\n528\n00:22:40.277 --> 00:22:43.980\n&gt;&gt; There are just certain movies you\ncan't top, you can't do better, right?\n\n529\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.850\nI mean, just talk to the people that made\nLethal Weapons 5, 7, 9, and 12, right?\n\n530\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.380\nFirst one was awesome.\n\n531\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.146\nSame thing with, although you know,\nfunnily enough though,\n\n532\n00:22:52.146 --> 00:22:54.086\nDie Hard was a little\nkinda crazy at the end.\n\n533\n00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:55.550\nI mean, there were a couple that\nwere just a little far fetched.\n\n534\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.080\nBut, you know, Die Hard as a series\noverall though, traditionally.\n\n535\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good.\n\n536\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.310\n&gt;&gt; They were all good enough,\nunique enough, different enough.\n\n537\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.503\nCuz they kill people in different ways,\nit was kind of fun and interesting.\n\n538\n00:23:03.503 --> 00:23:05.180\nSo it was kinda cool.\n\n539\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.080\nIt wasn't too graphic or gory.\n\n540\n00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.550\nBut you know, overall, not a bad series.\n\n541\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.919\nBut then there were some that just,\nyou know, outlived their usefulness.\n\n542\n00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.750\nI mean, it was kinda-\n&gt;&gt; It was like the Rambo.\n\n543\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.408\nFirst Blood was an amazing film.\n\n544\n00:23:14.408 --> 00:23:17.470\n&gt;&gt; It was just a dark and\nscary film, but really good, yeah.\n\n545\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.830\nYeah, and then there were some that\nwere just kind of like, all right.\n\n546\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.802\n&gt;&gt; It just became a reason\nto have Rambo on the screen.\n\n547\n00:23:20.802 --> 00:23:23.758\n&gt;&gt; He's a snake hunter up\nin the Viet Cong delta.\n\n548\n00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:27.674\nAnd he's going to have\nan existential crisis.\n\n549\n00:23:27.674 --> 00:23:29.600\nThat was a little much.\n\n550\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.725\nSame thing with Rocky.\n\n551\n00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:34.330\nRocky I was phenomenal, but\nthen like some in the middle, not so good.\n\n552\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.129\nBut then if you ever\nsaw the very last one.\n\n553\n00:23:35.129 --> 00:23:36.294\n&gt;&gt; Rocky II was pretty good.\n\n554\n00:23:36.294 --> 00:23:36.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were.\n\n555\n00:23:36.863 --> 00:23:39.775\nRocky I and II were good, but then there\nwas like, you know, there were a few-\n\n556\n00:23:39.775 --> 00:23:41.780\n&gt;&gt; The one with Ivan Drago, come on.\n\n557\n00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.300\n&gt;&gt; That was good.\n\n558\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.750\nBut then there were a few that were just,\nthey were a little hokey.\n\n559\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But then the very last one-\n\n560\n00:23:46.037 --> 00:23:46.783\n&gt;&gt; Really good.\n\n561\n00:23:46.783 --> 00:23:48.046\n&gt;&gt; Where he's like really washed up.\n\n562\n00:23:48.046 --> 00:23:51.160\nAdrian's died, right, and\nhe's like trying to figure out his life.\n\n563\n00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.194\n&gt;&gt; Spoiler alert.\n\n564\n00:23:52.194 --> 00:23:53.702\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right, exactly, spoiler alert.\n\n565\n00:23:53.702 --> 00:23:57.400\nBut then he winds up going back and\nkinda rediscovers what's important.\n\n566\n00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.390\nI mean, that was a really good movie.\n\n567\n00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was good.\n\n568\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.840\n&gt;&gt; That was actually, it was a really\ngood one, it was really good.\n\n569\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.807\nAnd then of course,\nthere's, what are the ones,\n\n570\n00:24:06.807 --> 00:24:09.836\nwhere every washed up action-\n&gt;&gt; The Expendables\n\n571\n00:24:09.836 --> 00:24:11.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Expendables.\n\n572\n00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.515\nBoth of those were just, they were fun.\n\n573\n00:24:13.515 --> 00:24:15.570\n&gt;&gt; That's what they were meant to be,\nand they hit the nail on the head.\n\n574\n00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.353\n&gt;&gt; And they did, that and Reds, also.\n\n575\n00:24:17.353 --> 00:24:18.954\nReds and Reds, awesome movies.\n\n576\n00:24:18.954 --> 00:24:20.405\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me started, Adam, we digress.\n\n577\n00:24:20.405 --> 00:24:24.123\n&gt;&gt; No but its good digression,\nit's good digression.\n\n578\n00:24:24.123 --> 00:24:26.351\nAll right, so, hal.dll,\nwant to make sure we know that.\n\n579\n00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:29.813\nWin32k.sys, nt.dll,\n\n580\n00:24:29.813 --> 00:24:35.152\nkernel32.dll Dll, advapi32.dll,\n\n581\n00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:39.782\nuser32.dll, and gdi32.dll.\n\n582\n00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:42.615\nThese are the standard Windows\nessential system files,\n\n583\n00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:44.098\nthe ones that gotta be there.\n\n584\n00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:47.151\nIf you don't have those,\nthen good luck cuz you don't have Windows,\n\n585\n00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:48.359\nyou gonna have to fix them.\n\n586\n00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:50.750\nRight now, we're not getting\ninto how do you fix Windows.\n\n587\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.090\nThat's a whole separate conversation,\ndifferent topic, different set of shows.\n\n588\n00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.530\nI'm just pointing out to you that these\nare the core files that should be\n\n589\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.000\navailable to you in Windows.\n\n590\n00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.580\nAnd obviously, we want to make sure and\nthink about why are we talking about this\n\n591\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.530\nin the middle of a forensics\ninvestigative concept or\n\n592\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.760\nforensics investigation discussion\non hard drives and file systems.\n\n593\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.110\nWell, half the name of the episode\nshould certainly give it away.\n\n594\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.290\nBut aside from that,\n\n595\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.210\nwhy is it important to know what\nthe core system files are for Windows?\n\n596\n00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.080\nWell, when you're investigating\na hard drive forensically,\n\n597\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.470\nyou're looking at information.\n\n598\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.640\nYou're trying to figure out whether or\nnot that drive has been modified.\n\n599\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.249\nWhether the OS has been modified,\nwhat's been done.\n\n600\n00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:28.330\nDon't you need to make sure that\nthe proper files are in place?\n\n601\n00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.840\nCheck the digital signatures to validate\nthat they have not been modified and\n\n602\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.650\nthat the vendor's files are intact?\n\n603\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.100\nAbsolutely you have to.\n\n604\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.930\nIf somebody monkeys around with the OS,\nif somebody's in there messing around and\n\n605\n00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.580\nswaps out these files and\nmay try to manipulate the OS.\n\n606\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.140\nI'm not suggesting it's easy,\nI'm not suggesting it would happen.\n\n607\n00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.830\nI'm just pointing out that this is one\nof the things on the checklist of hey,\n\n608\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.560\nwhat's there, let's validate everything.\n\n609\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.300\nWhen we do that bit stream\ndisk to disk copy and\n\n610\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.550\nwe work on that forensically sound image,\nwe're looking at stuff like this.\n\n611\n00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.520\nWe're examining these files,\nwe're making sure they're there.\n\n612\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.930\nWe're making sure we check the hashes,\n\n613\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.490\nthe digital signatures on these\nfiles against Microsoft's listed\n\n614\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.540\nknown goods to ensure the OS has\nintegrity, that it hasn't been modified.\n\n615\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.355\nIf somebody's running\na modified copy of the OS,\n\n616\n00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:17.185\nthat's a big indication to us that\nthey are up to no good in general.\n\n617\n00:26:17.185 --> 00:26:19.410\nAnd that there's probably a lot of\nother stuff we have to be aware of.\n\n618\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.960\nSo we would want to know about\nthese kind of files and know or\n\n619\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.350\nhave sense of them and\nunderstand what's going on with them.\n\n620\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.840\nTypes of file systems, very important to\n\n621\n00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.270\nthink about the different types\nof file systems that exist.\n\n622\n00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.810\nWhat kind of file systems would\nyou think of when I say hey,\n\n623\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.640\nthere's types of file systems\nthat we want to be aware of?\n\n624\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.170\nWhat do you think a file system would be?\n\n625\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.670\nWhat are some of the things\nwe're thinking about?\n\n626\n00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some of the common ones are NTFS.\n\n627\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.960\nThat's a file system very commonly used,\nespecially if you're in a Windows world.\n\n628\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.147\nObviously, exFAT is out there, old FATs,\n\n629\n00:26:49.147 --> 00:26:53.726\nthe good old FAT ones from\nback in the day, FAT16, FAT32.\n\n630\n00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:56.570\n&gt;&gt; FAT8,\nwhich is what FAT16 was actually built on.\n\n631\n00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Lots of them, tons of them.\n\n632\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.750\nISO 9660 or whatever it is for the CD-ROM.\n\n633\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so there's a whole bunch.\n\n634\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.420\nNow the ones that Daniel just rattled\noff are gonna be disk file systems.\n\n635\n00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.970\nEssentially, they're used for hard drives.\n\n636\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.576\nThere's actually categories of file\nsystems out beyond the traditional one we\n\n637\n00:27:12.576 --> 00:27:13.499\noften think about.\n\n638\n00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:17.553\nCuz when you ask somebody hey,\nwhat kind of file systems,\n\n639\n00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:20.686\nthey say exactly what Daniel said.\n\n640\n00:27:20.686 --> 00:27:25.100\nNTFS, FAT, EXT2, EXT3, HFS, HFS+,\nFAT, all that kind of stuff.\n\n641\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.220\nBut there's a bunch of others.\n\n642\n00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.500\nThere's shared disk,\nspecial purpose, tape,\n\n643\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.450\ntapes have their own file systems,\nDAT, etc.\n\n644\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:37.140\nFlash based file systems, database\nbased file systems, network and disks.\n\n645\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.840\nThere's actually seven categories\nthat have individual file systems\n\n646\n00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.910\nassociated with them.\n\n647\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.650\nWe often think about the last one,\nthe disk file system.\n\n648\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.590\nThat's the one that Daniel was correct\nin saying, there's all these kinds.\n\n649\n00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.050\nBut it's in a very small subcategory\nof a much broader thought process.\n\n650\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.220\nNow, in the area that Daniel mentioned,\n\n651\n00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.290\nwe're really talking about\ntraditional file systems.\n\n652\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.510\nHe mentioned several that were not Windows\nbased, but there are many that are.\n\n653\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.810\nFAT and NTFS, as we said,\n\n654\n00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.380\nare Windows-based file systems,\nalthough not exclusively.\n\n655\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.330\nYou can use FAT outside out of Windows,\nbut\n\n656\n00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.480\nNTFS is a traditional\nWindows-based file system.\n\n657\n00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.812\nRemember, in FAT, we have FAT12, FAT16,\n\n658\n00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:15.010\nFAT32, I think you mentioned\nseveral if not all of those.\n\n659\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.750\nWe have a slightly different\napproach in FAT than we do in NTFS.\n\n660\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.135\nSo we just want to make sure\nwe're aware of the concept.\n\n661\n00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:24.385\nWe store all the files at\nthe beginning of the volume in FAT.\n\n662\n00:28:24.385 --> 00:28:27.205\nAnd we have,\naside from the different versions,\n\n663\n00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:30.525\nwe have a specific layout,\na map that FAT uses.\n\n664\n00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:33.800\nWe have the reserved area,\nwe have the FAT area.\n\n665\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.360\nIt's good that you call the area\nthe same thing as the actual name of\n\n666\n00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.500\nthe file system.\n\n667\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.910\nAnd we have the data area, so\n\n668\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.950\nthree distinct areas that exist,\nwith regards to FAT.\n\n669\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.958\nThe reserved area, one sector in size,\n\n670\n00:28:43.958 --> 00:28:46.628\nincludes data pertaining\nto the file system itself.\n\n671\n00:28:46.628 --> 00:28:50.124\nSo essentially,\nhow FAT is setup is what's put into,\n\n672\n00:28:50.124 --> 00:28:54.540\nnot the overall data structures of FAT,\nthat's in the FAT area.\n\n673\n00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.560\nBut the reserved area is a higher level\nmap to explain how FAT will operate.\n\n674\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.520\nIs it FAT12, FAT16,\n\n675\n00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.900\nFAT32, what are the basic assumptions\nof that, that's in the reserved area.\n\n676\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.820\nIt's very small, it's one sector,\n512 bytes in size.\n\n677\n00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.160\nNot a lot of information\nyou could put in there.\n\n678\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.150\nThen we have the FAT area,\nthat's the FAT structures,\n\n679\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.740\nthe actual data structure of FAT itself.\n\n680\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.320\nSo the layout, the architecture,\nthe operational elements of FAT.\n\n681\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.840\nAnd then the data area's where all the\nclusters are allocated to store the file\n\n682\n00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.730\nand directory data.\n\n683\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.157\nThat's the rest of what we would think of.\n\n684\n00:29:25.157 --> 00:29:27.989\nThat's what when we think of FAT,\nwe say hey, I want to go get my data,\n\n685\n00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:31.220\nthat's what we traditionally think of,\nwe think of that.\n\n686\n00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.060\nAnything special we wanna know about FAT,\nperhaps?\n\n687\n00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.530\nCould we go to my machine for a minute\njust while we're talking about this?\n\n688\n00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.670\nJust wanna show you guys.\n\n689\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.900\nSo if we go in here and we take a look\nat drive E, I've got a little USB device\n\n690\n00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.470\nsitting on the side of my machine and\nit actually works now.\n\n691\n00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does.\n\n692\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.450\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be important.\n\n693\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.570\nActually, wait one second,\nI'm not thinking clearly here.\n\n694\n00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.430\nLet's do this on the one where\nwe can actually see that.\n\n695\n00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.280\nAlthough actually, I do have a USB device.\n\n696\n00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.840\nOr rather,\na FAT partition on the other one as well.\n\n697\n00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.010\nBut if we go into Windows 10 for a minute.\n\n698\n00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.500\nWe go to the USB device that I was\ntalking about that's sitting here,\n\n699\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.590\nwe highlight it.\n\n700\n00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.250\nWhen you look at these two, there's\nreally no way to discern which is FAT and\n\n701\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.790\nwhich one is not.\n\n702\n00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.637\nBut when we go in and\nwe look at the properties,\n\n703\n00:30:11.637 --> 00:30:14.123\nwe can tell that this is a FAT partition.\n\n704\n00:30:14.123 --> 00:30:17.541\nOr a FAT file system that has been\nplaced onto this USB device to\n\n705\n00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.150\ncreate the partition.\n\n706\n00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.910\nSo we could see it there,\njust some basic information about it.\n\n707\n00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:27.815\nIf we go in here to our\nlab environment and\n\n708\n00:30:27.815 --> 00:30:33.950\nwe go back here and we go to the E drive,\nwhich is also a FAT partition.\n\n709\n00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:37.862\nAnd we take a look,\nwe'll see that it also is FAT, FAT32, and\n\n710\n00:30:37.862 --> 00:30:39.754\nwe could see that listed here.\n\n711\n00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:42.139\nWe could see that we've got\nalmost everything free,\n\n712\n00:30:42.139 --> 00:30:46.064\nthere's really almost no space that's used\nin there right now, only 16 kilobytes.\n\n713\n00:30:46.064 --> 00:30:48.498\nBut we could see just by\nlooking that it's FAT.\n\n714\n00:30:48.498 --> 00:30:52.531\nAnd if we go to this drive right here,\nmount this, go to properties,\n\n715\n00:30:52.531 --> 00:30:54.620\nwe'll see that this is NTFS.\n\n716\n00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.850\nWe could see the difference between\nthe two visually just by looking.\n\n717\n00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.274\nThe M drive here is actually a mounted\nrecovery copy of the E drive, so\n\n718\n00:31:02.274 --> 00:31:05.949\nit's an exact duplicate, and\nwe mounted it with a tool.\n\n719\n00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:10.710\nAnd so we could see it's also FAT32, we're\njust mounting a recovery partition there.\n\n720\n00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.320\nSo we can easily take a look at drives and\n\n721\n00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.130\njust take a look at them visually seeing\nwhat kind of system they're going to have.\n\n722\n00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.120\nOr what kind of a Windows\nfile system may be present.\n\n723\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.990\nWhen we talk about FAT, remember we're\ntalking about an older file system.\n\n724\n00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:29.180\nOne, and I asked the question a second\nag really more as a general question for\n\n725\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.180\nmyself, not so much because any of you or\nDaniel would have answered it.\n\n726\n00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.990\nBut I said hey, are there anything\nspecial things to know about FAT?\n\n727\n00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.040\nAnd the main thing to know is that\nwe do have a size limitation on FAT.\n\n728\n00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.380\nFiles, remember on the FAT partitions\nthemselves, would only be a certain size.\n\n729\n00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.003\nWe wouldn't get out beyond, pardon me,\nout beyond that initial size limitation.\n\n730\n00:31:47.003 --> 00:31:50.973\nWhereas with NTFS, files and the file\nsystem and the partition itself can be\n\n731\n00:31:50.973 --> 00:31:54.833\nmuch bigger, up into the terabyte\nrange depending on what we're doing.\n\n732\n00:31:54.833 --> 00:31:56.689\nSo you just want to keep that in mind and\nthink about that.\n\n733\n00:31:56.689 --> 00:31:59.672\nYet another reason we don't\ntend to use that very often.\n\n734\n00:31:59.672 --> 00:32:03.434\nNTFS, kind of a newer concept,\nbuilds on its predecessors.\n\n735\n00:32:03.434 --> 00:32:06.393\nA lot of features,\nthings like sparse file support,\n\n736\n00:32:06.393 --> 00:32:10.450\nquotas for disk usage which is kind\nof interesting, reparse points.\n\n737\n00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:14.566\nWe have distributive link tracking,\nfile level encryption using EFS,\n\n738\n00:32:14.566 --> 00:32:15.990\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n739\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:20.925\nEFS is what is traditionally known as file\nlevel encryption of the Windows world, but\n\n740\n00:32:20.925 --> 00:32:25.210\nthere's a bunch of stuff that is new,\nkind of as a feature set for NTFS.\n\n741\n00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.345\nWe have a bunch of files that NTFS use or\n\n742\n00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:32.490\nsystem files that are going to\nbe part of the NTFS world, ATT,\n\n743\n00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.210\nRDEF, BADCLUS, bitmap BootLog file, MFT,\n\n744\n00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:43.590\nwhich is the master file table,\nthe record of every file on the system.\n\n745\n00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:47.630\nMFT Mirror which is the mirror\nrecovery for the MFT, quota for\n\n746\n00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.900\nquotas, uppercase to convert characters\nin uppercase Unicode, and volume,\n\n747\n00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.300\nwhich is where we do our volume naming and\nversion numbering.\n\n748\n00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.530\nAll these are listed in the share notes\nalong with a little description of what\n\n749\n00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.345\neach one is.\n\n750\n00:32:58.345 --> 00:33:00.380\nI kinda just gave that you so\nyou know what they are.\n\n751\n00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.550\nBut you do have those,\nyou just wanna take at look at those.\n\n752\n00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.641\nA lot of times we talk about NTFS people\ndon't realize there's actually a whole set\n\n753\n00:33:06.641 --> 00:33:09.973\nof files that are mapped as part of\nthe NTFS file system that we use for\n\n754\n00:33:09.973 --> 00:33:11.393\nstructure and management.\n\n755\n00:33:11.393 --> 00:33:12.595\nSo it's good to know this.\n\n756\n00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:15.200\nWe also have the boot sector with NTFS.\n\n757\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.829\nAnd we have a cluster size concept,\n\n758\n00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:19.170\nwe just wanna be aware\nof some of those things.\n\n759\n00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.410\nWhen we format the NTFS partition,\n\n760\n00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:28.120\nwe assign the first 16 sectors to actually\nthe boot sector and the Bootstrap code.\n\n761\n00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.380\nSo remember, if it's 512 bytes for\n\n762\n00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.240\nthe allocation of a sector, and then\n16 of them times 512, you do the math.\n\n763\n00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.070\nThat's the amount of space,\ntraditionally, that we allocate out and\n\n764\n00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.400\nthat we have available.\n\n765\n00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.790\nAnd then we have a partition identifier\nthat's going to be like the MBR,\n\n766\n00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.070\nessentially the master boot record\nis what we would think of it as.\n\n767\n00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:53.920\nAnd it's got a unique GUID, if it's for\nMBR, for the old Master Boot Record,\n\n768\n00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.030\nit's gonna be 0 by 07, 0x07, to represent\nthe MBR and the partition identifier.\n\n769\n00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.900\nIf it is a GPT, GUID Partition Table, and\n\n770\n00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.430\nnewer thought process,\nwe've got a rather long unique string.\n\n771\n00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.692\nWe put that for you again in the notes so\n\n772\n00:34:07.692 --> 00:34:10.468\nyou can see it's a long\nalphanumeric string.\n\n773\n00:34:10.468 --> 00:34:13.771\nBut you'll be able to tell the difference\nwhen you look at the drive if you use\n\n774\n00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:15.174\na forensics tool to examine it.\n\n775\n00:34:15.174 --> 00:34:19.470\nWhether it was set up using an older or\nnewer concept when we partitioned it out.\n\n776\n00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.090\nSo it's kind of interesting to see that.\n\n777\n00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.480\nAnd then we have the cluster sizes.\n\n778\n00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.320\nIn the last show, we talked about the fact\nthat we have variable cluster size,\n\n779\n00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.590\ndepending on the partition\nsize of the hard drive.\n\n780\n00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.670\nAnd I said we would run\nthrough those with you, so\n\n781\n00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.530\nlet's just quickly talk about those.\n\n782\n00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.240\nWe have a variable cluster\nsize depending on volume size.\n\n783\n00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.260\n512 megabytes or less,\n\n784\n00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.640\nnot that you would, when would you ever\nallocate out a 512 megabyte partition?\n\n785\n00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.870\nBut if you did that,\nyou would have a 512 byte cluster size so\n\n786\n00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.980\nit would be the smallest allocation.\n\n787\n00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.710\nIf you have anything from 513\nmegabytes up to 1 gigabyte,\n\n788\n00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.300\nyou would have a 1 kilobyte cluster.\n\n789\n00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.028\n1 gigabyte up to 2 gigabytes,\nyou'd have a 2 kilobyte cluster.\n\n790\n00:34:57.028 --> 00:35:01.910\nLarger than 2 gigabytes, and the reality\nis in our world, most of these partitions\n\n791\n00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.350\nare gonna be larger than 2 gigabytes,\nyou'll have a 4 kilobyte cluster.\n\n792\n00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.912\nSo traditional cluster size in most\nhard drives, and again, important for\n\n793\n00:35:10.912 --> 00:35:13.621\nus as forensic investigators\nto know this and\n\n794\n00:35:13.621 --> 00:35:17.990\nunderstand this, is 4,096 bytes or\n4 kilobytes traditionally.\n\n795\n00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.050\nThat's what we normally see when\nwe actually go and we take a look.\n\n796\n00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.540\nRemember, as a result of that, when we're\nthinking about that, we're looking at\n\n797\n00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.100\nchunking data in terms of management into\nthese clusters and working with them.\n\n798\n00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.280\nThere'll be so many clusters per drive\nas we walk through with you, and\n\n799\n00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.037\nyou want to think about and be aware of.\n\n800\n00:35:35.037 --> 00:35:38.775\nAnd just make sure you have that in mind,\nbecause it would be important,\n\n801\n00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:40.492\nin theory anyway, important for\n\n802\n00:35:40.492 --> 00:35:44.751\nyou to have knowledge of the different\ncluster sizes based on the partition size.\n\n803\n00:35:44.751 --> 00:35:48.080\nIf you're ever asked about them at some\npoint, it may be helpful for you to have\n\n804\n00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.521\na little bit of knowledge about that and\njust know what the variable sizes may be.\n\n805\n00:35:51.521 --> 00:35:52.910\nSo it's always good to know.\n\n806\n00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.410\nWe talked about the master file table\nas being the list of all the files that\n\n807\n00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:58.930\nare stored in the drive.\n\n808\n00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.030\nIt's a relational database essentially\nthat maintains a mapping of every drive,\n\n809\n00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.325\nor every file that we put onto the drive.\n\n810\n00:36:05.325 --> 00:36:07.220\nSo we just wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n811\n00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.190\nWe reserve 16 records in there for\nthe system files.\n\n812\n00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.170\nAll the other records are essentially\njust gonna list out the files that\n\n813\n00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.666\nare stored inside the partition.\n\n814\n00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:17.190\nSo we wanna make sure that\nyou're aware of that.\n\n815\n00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.120\nAnd we're not gonna do it now but\nwhen we come back for part three,\n\n816\n00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.020\nwe're gonna have a really cool demo\nthat we're gonna take a look at.\n\n817\n00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.580\nI did this for Daniel off camera here\na little while ago as we were getting\n\n818\n00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.960\nready to get started and-\n&gt;&gt; It was like watching\n\n819\n00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.743\na David Blaine special.\n\n820\n00:36:32.743 --> 00:36:35.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He thought it was pretty cool.\n\n821\n00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.910\nWe're gonna preview it,\njust give you a sense of what it is.\n\n822\n00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.010\nWe're not gonna do it now.\n\n823\n00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.390\nWe'll do it when we come back, but\n\n824\n00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.580\nwe're gonna take a look at ADS, Alternate\nData Streams and talk about those.\n\n825\n00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.850\nAnd I know you were kind of\nnot enthralled by it, but and\n\n826\n00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.310\nit's amazing cuz you could have picked\nDaniel up and carried him away.\n\n827\n00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.900\nHe was so busy watching, he didn't\nknow anything was going on around him.\n\n828\n00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.260\nBut when I explained the concept\ngame he said this is kind of cool,\n\n829\n00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.710\ncan you show me what it looks like?\n\n830\n00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.080\nAnd we took a look at it and\nhe thought it was pretty neat.\n\n831\n00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.410\nSo hopefully you guys will as well.\n\n832\n00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.390\nWe're gonna come back,\ntake a look at that,\n\n833\n00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.385\nin just two shakes of a NTFS partition.\n\n834\n00:37:05.385 --> 00:37:07.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is pretty cool.\n\n835\n00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.320\nYou guys will enjoy that demonstration.\n\n836\n00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.590\nBut unfortunately, for\nthis episode we're well out of time.\n\n837\n00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.850\nSo, like Adam said we're gonna\nhave to make that part three.\n\n838\n00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.230\nSo, definitely check that out so if\nyou're done watching this go run over and\n\n839\n00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.200\nwatch part three as soon\nas humanly possible.\n\n840\n00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.600\nAdam, thanks for\njoining us here in part two.\n\n841\n00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.370\nWe appreciate that,\nwe appreciate you guys watching.\n\n842\n00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.878\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for the day.\n\n843\n00:37:26.878 --> 00:37:30.200\nFor ITProTV [CROSSTALK] well,\nthey don't know.\n\n844\n00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.610\nIt could be day for them, they don't know.\n\n845\n00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.397\nYou've got to remember this\nis recorded television.\n\n846\n00:37:33.397 --> 00:37:34.275\n&gt;&gt; But\nwhat if they're watching it at night?\n\n847\n00:37:34.275 --> 00:37:37.679\n&gt;&gt; They could be like, his is my last\nepisode man, I just can't do another one.\n\n848\n00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:39.978\n[CROSSTALK] Then it's\nthe end of the day for them.\n\n849\n00:37:39.978 --> 00:37:41.904\n&gt;&gt; But no, they have to come back.\n\n850\n00:37:41.904 --> 00:37:42.845\n&gt;&gt; See you next time

00:00:08.228\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:11.965\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:13.905\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:16.940\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.870\nAnd in today's episode, we are moving\nforward with more on our CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.970\nJoining us back in the studio again for\na part three on hard disk and\n\n10\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.340\nfile systems, our good friend,\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.000\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.960\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Mucho bueno.\n\n14\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.220\n&gt;&gt; I could say that in Greek, but I don't\nknow how to put all the letters together.\n\n15\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.620\nSo I'm just gonna go with very good,\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n16\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920\nWelcome to all of you that are joining us.\n\n17\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.810\nAnd here to talk about hard drives and\nfile systems,\n\n18\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.470\nI'm gonna turn it over to Daniel who's\ngonna now show us how to do an ADS.\n\n19\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.530\n&gt;&gt; And here we are.\n\n21\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.652\nAnd Daniel's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So what you do is.\n\n22\n00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Know what to do.\n\n23\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.650\nI'm just gonna give it back to you.\n\n24\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.970\nSo I'm only kidding,\nDaniel's not gonna show us.\n\n25\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.600\nBut he is gonna help me talk about ADS,\nall kidding aside.\n\n26\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.550\nLet's start by just defining what ADS is.\n\n27\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.130\nAnd I mentioned this at the very\ntail end of our last discussion,\n\n28\n00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.620\nwhich was hey come on back and\nsee what we're gonna do.\n\n29\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.530\nBut let's talk about, as we continue\ntalking about hard drives and\n\n30\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.450\nfile systems.\n\n31\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.250\nSomething really important for the\nforensic investigator to be aware of which\n\n32\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.740\nis a unique attribute, essentially\na unique way in which NTFS operates.\n\n33\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.040\nIt allows us to be able to create\nan alternate data stream, ADS,\n\n34\n00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.510\nalternate data stream.\n\n35\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.279\nAnd the support for ADS built into\nNTFS [COUGH] sound like Dr. Seuss.\n\n36\n00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:32.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is they're surprisingly from\n\n37\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.960\na historical perspective.\n\n38\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.680\nBecause the powers that be that were\nsetting up the NTFS file system\n\n39\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.630\nincorporated support for HFS.\n\n40\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.550\nThe file system that's used in Unix,\nLinux,\n\n41\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.700\nand HFS, HFS+ in the Mac OS\nin later iterations as well.\n\n42\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.515\nSo that we would have some capabilities\nand cross platform support.\n\n43\n00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:56.950\nAnd as a result of incorporating\nsupport for that and elements of it,\n\n44\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.060\nwe actually have this ability to create\nwhat are known as alternate data streams.\n\n45\n00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.170\nNTFS supports the concept\nof multiple data streams.\n\n46\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.170\nEvery stream identifies\na new data attribute and\n\n47\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.580\na set of attributes unique\nto that stream on a file.\n\n48\n00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.130\nAnd as a result, we can open up a handle.\n\n49\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.350\nEssentially access the data and\n\n50\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.910\nthe attributes associated\nwith it in that stream.\n\n51\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.830\nAnd so imagine that we take a file, which\nis what we're gonna show you how to do\n\n52\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490\nhere in a minute, and\nwe create it using a program like Notepad.\n\n53\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.220\nWhich is what I'm gonna demonstrate and\nshow you how to do.\n\n54\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.860\nAnd we call that file original1.txt.\n\n55\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.920\nIf we then create a second file\nassociated with the first, and\n\n56\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.630\nwe do it in such a way that\nif this is the first file.\n\n57\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.090\nThis is the second file.\n\n58\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.140\nWe essentially encapsulate the second\nfile by wrapping it with the first file.\n\n59\n00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020\nYou don't see the second file.\n\n60\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.680\nThere's no way for you to reference it.\n\n61\n00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.590\nIt's not available through\nthe GUI in the Windows Explorer.\n\n62\n00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.580\nYou would have no knowledge\nof it being there.\n\n63\n00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.610\nBut, as I showed Daniel and\nas he will attest to, the file is there.\n\n64\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.690\nThe second file is there.\n\n65\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.520\nIt has substance.\n\n66\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.842\nSo I'm gonna put data into it, show\nyou how we do that and we're then able\n\n67\n00:03:06.842 --> 00:03:10.700\nto access one or both files depending on\nwhether we know they're there or not.\n\n68\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.080\nIt's a hidden alternate data stream.\n\n69\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.980\nRight, it's essentially not available\nunless you know it's there.\n\n70\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.730\nNow, there are tools that we can use\nto find these alternate data streams.\n\n71\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.470\nLads is a very famous tool that's used.\n\n72\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.910\nThere is another tool that we use\nfrom the sysinternals tool set,\n\n73\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.010\nwhich I'll show you where to download and\nshow you how to use.\n\n74\n00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.540\nIt's called streams.\n\n75\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.980\nWe could take a look at that.\n\n76\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.220\nYou can go out and\n\n77\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.900\nyou can find a tool from a stream\narmor that will also do this.\n\n78\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.931\nThere's a lot of different places you\ncan find tools that will submit, or\n\n79\n00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.287\nrather show you whether there is an NTFS\nADS associated with dthe ata item and you\n\n80\n00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:50.469\ncould then obviously as an investigator\npull open that item and examine it.\n\n81\n00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.509\nSo that's gonna help us to\nunderstand there is data there.\n\n82\n00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.949\nAs I mentioned as well to Daniel,\nand we are talking about this.\n\n83\n00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.352\nOne of the interesting things I\ntold you was that, if you remember,\n\n84\n00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:03.590\nif you move an ADS data stream out of\nthe NTFS partition where it's supported.\n\n85\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.910\nAnd we move it into a non-NTFS partition,\nwe lose or essentially delete the stream.\n\n86\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.430\nAnd so one of the things we have to be\ncareful of as we examine drives is that we\n\n87\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.850\ndon't wind up moving or manipulating data\nwithout knowing what's there because if we\n\n88\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.110\ndo, for some reason we may actually\nlose access to that data which would of\n\n89\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.830\ncourse be a very negative thing, and\ncan lead to all sorts of issues.\n\n90\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.649\nSo let's take a look real\nquick if you don't mind.\n\n91\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.680\nLet me show you how to create an NTFS ADS,\nright.\n\n92\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.770\nSo we're in our traditional\nenvironment as you can see.\n\n93\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.070\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up a command line.\n\n94\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.212\nJust open this up here.\n\n95\n00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:42.470\nI'm gonna zoom in for a second,\njust so we can see that.\n\n96\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.240\nAnd of course you can\nsee absolutely nothing.\n\n97\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.821\nThe best laid plans of demos, right?\n\n98\n00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:46.526\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You can see.\n\n99\n00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:47.407\n&gt;&gt; Ahh!\n\n100\n00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.100\n&gt;&gt; A pixellated madness [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.980\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n102\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.000\nAll right, that's what I wanted.\n\n103\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.420\n&gt;&gt; After everyone stops throwing up.\n\n104\n00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.647\n&gt;&gt; You can't, [SOUND],\nyou can't trust me to use the zoom tool.\n\n105\n00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:57.637\nI promise I had it all worked\nout before we did this.\n\n106\n00:04:57.637 --> 00:04:59.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was set, ready to come up and\n\n107\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.330\nof course, there you go.\n\n108\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.410\nBut hey, live folks,\nlive, absolutely live.\n\n109\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.820\nNo safety net here at ITProTV.\n\n110\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.800\nSo you could see, I'm just using\nthe zoom it tool to be able to zoom in.\n\n111\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.740\nYou could see that in the administrative\ncommand prompt in Windows.\n\n112\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.739\nI'm in a subdirectory called si.\n\n113\n00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:16.480\nThere's no significance at all,\nby the way, to that subdirectory.\n\n114\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.320\nIt's just where I happen to have decided\nto create the stream because the tool that\n\n115\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.610\nI'm gonna use to show it to you is sitting\nin that directory, so it's just easier.\n\n116\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.440\nI don't have to worry about changing\ndirectories to go find stuff.\n\n117\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.820\nThat's the only reason I've done that,\n\n118\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.910\nso ignore the fact that I'm\nsitting in a subdirectory.\n\n119\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.950\nBut you'll notice that I typed\nin the command notepad, as in,\n\n120\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.950\nI wanna use notepad.exe, space and\nthen the name of a file.\n\n121\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.760\nI called my original file sam1.txt so\n\n122\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.990\nthat's gonna be the file\nthat we're gonna create.\n\n123\n00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.565\nI'm gonna show you that file\nin just a second, colon,\n\n124\n00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:51.396\nno space, and then the name of another\nfile, in this case sectest.txt.\n\n125\n00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:55.648\nSo I'm essentially creating two text files\nbut we're only gonna see one of them and\n\n126\n00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:56.690\nlet's take a look.\n\n127\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.950\nSo, we've executed that command, right?\n\n128\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.530\nI've done that.\n\n129\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.180\nAnd when I've done that what we\nfind inside the SI directory\n\n130\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.400\nwill be the following.\n\n131\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.040\nRight there is our sam1 file,\n\n132\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.890\nso that's the Notepad file that\nI've just created in Notepad.\n\n133\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.090\nAnd when we scroll over, you'll take\na look and see that the size of that file\n\n134\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.070\nis 0 kilobytes as in, in theory, there's\nno data inside of this notepad file.\n\n135\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.120\nLet's open this notepad file up and\nwe'll take a look and\n\n136\n00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.640\nyou can see that there is no\ndata inside the file, right.\n\n137\n00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.240\nIt is the sam1 file and\n\n138\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.950\nthere's nothing in there as you can see\n&gt;&gt; Blank\n\n139\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.200\n&gt;&gt; It is blank, all right.\n\n140\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.700\nSo, gonna leave that file open for\njust a second.\n\n141\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.930\nI'm just gonna go ahead,\njust minimize that down to the desktop.\n\n142\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.450\nI'm gonna minimize the directory as well.\n\n143\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.310\nAnd what we're gonna do, is just come in\nhere, just backspace back through that.\n\n144\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.990\nAnd what I wanna do, so I wanna\nbring up the command to show you how\n\n145\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.520\nto use the tool that will find\nthe alternate data stream.\n\n146\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.740\nThe sit tool called streams from\nthe sys internal's website.\n\n147\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.564\nStream 64 cuz I'm on a 64 bit OS,\nso we're using the 64 bit tool.\n\n148\n00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:15.380\nBut before I run the tool, let me just\nshow you where you get this and many other\n\n149\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.460\ntools that we're gonna be talking about\nin this episode and other episodes.\n\n150\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.790\nI've gone out to the Microsoft tech net\nsite, so www.technet.Microsoft.com.\n\n151\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.530\nI'll gone to the Windows\nsys internals site.\n\n152\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.000\nYou could actually just\nGoogle sys internals tools,\n\n153\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.570\nyou'll find a link directly\nto download the tool set.\n\n154\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.180\nWe can download the entire suite.\n\n155\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.900\nIt's roughly about 21 megabytes in size.\n\n156\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.580\nAnd it's got all of these tools.\n\n157\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.970\nA list of them here associated with it.\n\n158\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.720\nWe've got all these tools\nin the demo environment,\n\n159\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.730\nwe're gonna be using\na fair number of them.\n\n160\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.630\nI'm using the zoom in tool right now, as\nyou've seen, although not always properly.\n\n161\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.200\nAnd I'm about to demo and\nuse the Streams tool right here.\n\n162\n00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.690\nAnd so for\ninstance when we click on streams.\n\n163\n00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.220\nAnd we just take a look real\nquick at the individual tool.\n\n164\n00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.150\nIt tells us a little bit about the tool.\n\n165\n00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.643\nWhat it is, what it does,\nwhat it's used for.\n\n166\n00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:03.544\nGives us the usage information.\n\n167\n00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:05.399\nWhich we could see by\nreading the help file.\n\n168\n00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.331\nAnd allows us to download that\nindividual tool If we want to,\n\n169\n00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.400\nwe're gonna obviously just use the tool,\n\n170\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.260\nbecause we've downloaded the entire\ntool set, I already have it set up.\n\n171\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.640\nSo, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n172\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.110\nand we're simply gonna issue the streams\ncommand, along with the s switch.\n\n173\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.490\nWe're gonna do that, it's gonna do\nthrough, look at the sub directory.\n\n174\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.180\nSo, it's gonna parse every file in\nthe directory I'm in looking for\n\n175\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.750\nalternate data streams.\n\n176\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.250\nAnd what we find is, it's going through\nall the tools that are in that directory.\n\n177\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.630\nAnd most of them come up with no\nalternate data stream attached.\n\n178\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.950\nWe're just gonna scroll up and\nwe can see that.\n\n179\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.330\nBut we do find that there is one tool,\nI will highlight it, that does,\n\n180\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.350\noops let me just do a little\nbetter job of that so\n\n181\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.810\nwe only have that, that does have an\nalternate data stream associated with it.\n\n182\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:54.709\nAnd when we zoom in,\nwhat we can find is that the sam1.txt\n\n183\n00:08:54.709 --> 00:09:00.045\nfile calling sectest.txt is gonna\nhave an alternate data stream,\n\n184\n00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:03.890\nsectest.txt is the alternate\ndata stream file and\n\n185\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.780\nyou could see that it's\ngot a different read out.\n\n186\n00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.550\nGives us different information.\n\n187\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.320\nTells us that there is\nan alternate data stream.\n\n188\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.180\nNow we have to obviously know how\nthe tool works, know what to look for.\n\n189\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.470\nEvery ADS tool's a little bit different.\n\n190\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.179\nLads will identify this\na little bit differently,\n\n191\n00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:22.522\nStream Armors tool will identify\nit a little bit differently.\n\n192\n00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:26.163\nAnd you can obviously take a look at\nvarieties but ultimately the goal is hey,\n\n193\n00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:28.862\nthere's something unusual,\nright, about that file.\n\n194\n00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:31.870\nNow, how do we see that file?\n\n195\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.610\nWell, we've been given all\nthe information we need right here.\n\n196\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.370\nWe know that it's called\nsam1.txt:sectest.txt.\n\n197\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.810\nSo what we're gonna do is\nsimply do the following.\n\n198\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:47.268\nWe're just gonna come down here to\nthe bottom of the command line and\n\n199\n00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:49.470\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n200\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.760\nwe're just going to issue the same\ncommand that we started with.\n\n201\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.328\nRight here, we're gonna go\nahead knowing it's a txt file.\n\n202\n00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:03.330\nLogic would dictate normally, right.\n\n203\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.530\nHey, let me try this with Notepad.\n\n204\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.800\nI may have to search around.\n\n205\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.560\nBut chances are good Notepad's gonna work.\n\n206\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.680\nSo let me try Notepad and I'm gonna\njust simply issue the command for\n\n207\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.700\nthe program Notepad and\nthen the string for the files.\n\n208\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.813\nSo when I do that,\nwhat we're gonna get is the following.\n\n209\n00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.375\nAnd what you'll see, let me just zoom in.\n\n210\n00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:26.787\nIs I get the file called\nsam1.txt:sectest which is\n\n211\n00:10:26.787 --> 00:10:32.277\nthe alternate data stream file which\nis really the sectest file and\n\n212\n00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:35.920\nyou can see that this\nhas information in it.\n\n213\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.210\nI told you that there\nwould be data in there.\n\n214\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.690\nAnd you can see it's got\nHello World Sample test for ADS, on NTFS,\n\n215\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.570\nlittle smiley face and we can see\nthat that data does indeed exist,\n\n216\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:53.700\nthere's substance in this file, but\nif we compare that to our sam1 file\n\n217\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.450\nwhich is you can see right there, let's\nmove it over so you can see everything.\n\n218\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.650\nIs indeed blank, right.\n\n219\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.287\nAnd we know that because we looked at it.\n\n220\n00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.166\nThat there is no data in that file.\n\n221\n00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:10.450\n&gt;&gt; So when Jason Bourne wants to\npass a secret message to whomever.\n\n222\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.550\nThis is the way he's gonna probably, or\nat least one of the ways he could do that.\n\n223\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.400\n&gt;&gt; He's probably gonna have way\ncool Hollywood sound effects that\n\n224\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.210\nare much better.\n\n225\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.937\nAnd don't forget sparky computer\ntricks that are better than this.\n\n226\n00:11:19.937 --> 00:11:21.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if we go and we take a look,\n\n227\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.292\nif he was doing it in the real world\nas opposed to in Hollywood, then yeah,\n\n228\n00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:26.520\nhe may do it this way.\n\n229\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.320\nBut you'll see that the sam1 file\nis the one that's zero kilobytes,\n\n230\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.022\nthat's sitting in the Windows Explorer.\n\n231\n00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:36.970\nThe sectest file does not register and\nis not available, we do not see it.\n\n232\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n233\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.670\n&gt;&gt; So that's the alternate\ndata stream right there.\n\n234\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.090\nAnd that's how we actually do an ADS.\n\n235\n00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.900\nSo it's an interesting little\nquirk of the NTFS file system.\n\n236\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.610\nBut one that is actually very important\nfor us as investigators to be aware.\n\n237\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.450\nI'd like to actually go back here for\njust a second.\n\n238\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.360\nWasn't quite done.\n\n239\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.200\nWanna show you one other thing.\n\n240\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.430\nI mentioned that, and actually,\nlet me get to the right Google Chrome\n\n241\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.790\nwebsite that there's another tool you\nmay wanna use or at least investigate.\n\n242\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.220\nCompany called Stream Armor,\nhas some pretty interesting stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.290\nOr excuse me, SecurityXploded, rather.\n\n244\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.150\nStream Armor is the name of the tool.\n\n245\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.980\nBut if you go to SecurityXploded\nwith an X you can see it up there.\n\n246\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.000\nThe Stream Armor tool is gonna\nlet you find ADS files as well,\n\n247\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.980\nit's also a very good tool.\n\n248\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.620\nThey make a lot of other\nreally interesting tools and\n\n249\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.260\nyou should definitely take a look.\n\n250\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.010\nIf you go here, you will see, if we\njust do All Security Tools real quick.\n\n251\n00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.320\nThey have password recovery tools, we'll\npotentially talk about some of these.\n\n252\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.150\nThey've also got browser\npassword dump files tools,\n\n253\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.415\nlot of different stuff,\nLM password crackers, lot of cool stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:46.130\nThey got network security tools,\ndirectory scanners, ad blockers,\n\n255\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.810\nthings like that, LDAP search,\nMac address scanners.\n\n256\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.680\nThey've got spyware, anti root kit tools,\nnot really the subject of what we're\n\n257\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.200\ndoing, but then we also have system\nsecurity tools, browser history spy,\n\n258\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.420\nChrome manager, these are tools we'll talk\nabout in on upcoming set of conversations\n\n259\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.370\nso they're not necessarily these,\nbut they allow us to go in,\n\n260\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.670\nlook at the browser caches,\nfind all sorts of interesting information.\n\n261\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.644\nThey let us look at DOLs,\nlet us look at download hash verifiers,\n\n262\n00:13:13.644 --> 00:13:16.048\nlet us look at digital signatures etc.\n\n263\n00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:19.385\nSo just some interesting stuff\nthat you may wanna be aware of.\n\n264\n00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:22.932\nAnd a tool or a company rather like that\nthat has a bunch of these kinda tools is\n\n265\n00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:26.093\nusually pretty good for\nthe investigator and or just generically,\n\n266\n00:13:26.093 --> 00:13:28.090\nthe security professional to be aware of,\n\n267\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.220\nbecause these are the kind of\ntools that may be valuable for us.\n\n268\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.230\nWanna show you something\nelse while we're in here.\n\n269\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:38.390\nIn addition to ADS, we often or\nalso will talk about another attribute\n\n270\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:43.130\nof the NTFS file systems, something known\nas EFS, the encrypting file system.\n\n271\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.280\nAnd let me just bring\nup a Windows Explorer.\n\n272\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.420\nLet's just go into the C drive here for\na second.\n\n273\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.010\nAnd let me just create\na sample folder real quick.\n\n274\n00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.820\nWe'll call this efstest.\n\n275\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:04.275\nAnd let's just go into efstest, and let's\njust put a Little text file in there.\n\n276\n00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:07.020\nJust so we have something to work with.\n\n277\n00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.760\nAnd all I did was create a folder and\ncreate a file, right, nothing fancy.\n\n278\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.818\nNo hidden data files, none of this crazy\nstuff, just something real basic, right?\n\n279\n00:14:14.818 --> 00:14:19.420\nNow EFS, the encrypting file system,\nallows us to be able to use again,\n\n280\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.530\nnative attributes of NTFS that allow us\nto apply encryption to individual files.\n\n281\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.417\nSo I can right click on the file,\nI can go to properties.\n\n282\n00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:33.548\nI can go to attributes down here, and\nI can, just move this over so you can see.\n\n283\n00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:38.197\nI can go to advanced, and\nwhen I go to advanced,\n\n284\n00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:42.700\noops, when I go to advanced, there we go.\n\n285\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.330\nWhat I can do is I can go in and\n\n286\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:51.230\nI can compress and or\nI can encrypt the contents of the file.\n\n287\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.570\nNow these, it's interesting this\nhas been the way In Windows for\n\n288\n00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.270\nas far back as I can remember.\n\n289\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.310\nYou know you would think if two\nelements are items on a menu or\n\n290\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.325\nin this case on an interface\nare mutually exclusive,\n\n291\n00:15:02.325 --> 00:15:06.060\nthen normally we see radio buttons right,\nas opposed to check boxes.\n\n292\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.770\nBut compression and encryption, you can\nactually compress and or encrypt, but\n\n293\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.570\nyou can't do at the same time.\n\n294\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.560\nAnd so, they didn't change the interface.\n\n295\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.900\nYou actually are able to in theory\nselect both, but if you think about it,\n\n296\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.300\nyou have to uncompress to then unencrypt.\n\n297\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.720\nAnd you have to unencrypt in order to\nbe able to then compress or uncompress.\n\n298\n00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720\nSo it's just a funny way that,\nthere we go.\n\n299\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.741\n&gt;&gt; A little oversight on the-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n300\n00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Interface programmer's part.\n\n301\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.230\n&gt;&gt; It's just always been one\nof those little quirky things.\n\n302\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.440\nI never understood why they didn't\njust make it a radio button,\n\n303\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.000\nwhen you're not supposed to be\nable to do both at the same time.\n\n304\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.880\nBut we're gonna choose Encrypt the file.\n\n305\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.090\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n306\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.270\nSo we're gonna go do that.\n\n307\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.110\nNot a big deal and let's apply that.\n\n308\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.390\nWe're then gonna get a little prompt here.\n\n309\n00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.890\nJust so we can see what that looks like,\nwe'll move in just so you can see that.\n\n310\n00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.510\nYou are encrypting a file that\nis in an unencrypted folder,\n\n311\n00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.100\ncuz I'm not encrypting the folder,\nI'm just encrypting the file.\n\n312\n00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.850\nIf this file is modified,\n\n313\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.600\nsoftware might store a temporary\nunencrypted copy of the file.\n\n314\n00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.318\nGood for us, as investigators,\nto know that.\n\n315\n00:16:07.318 --> 00:16:12.151\nMay be able to get that out of the\nvolatile data sitting in the hard drive in\n\n316\n00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:16.841\na cache or In some throwaway directory so\nthere's a lot of temp files.\n\n317\n00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:20.390\nWe will capture those by making\na forensically sound copy of the drive and\n\n318\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.090\nwe'll be able to work with those.\n\n319\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:22.602\nThat's important to know.\n\n320\n00:16:22.602 --> 00:16:25.792\nTo ensure that files created in\nthe parent folder are encrypted,\n\n321\n00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:28.260\nencrypt the parent folders so\nit's warning us.\n\n322\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.072\nIt's saying hey, pay attention, you may\nbe setting yourself up in such a way that\n\n323\n00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:36.052\nyou're essentially gonna violate the very\nconcept of confidentiality that you're\n\n324\n00:16:36.052 --> 00:16:38.057\ncreating with the encryption attribute.\n\n325\n00:16:38.057 --> 00:16:40.294\nIf you don't encrypt the container but\n\n326\n00:16:40.294 --> 00:16:42.870\nonly encrypt the contents\nof the container,\n\n327\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.780\nyou may have a situation where you may\nexpose the contents without meaning to.\n\n328\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.870\nThat's obviously something\nwe want to be aware of.\n\n329\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.940\nWhat do I wanna do?\n\n330\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.458\nDo I want to encrypt the file and it's\nparent folder, notice that's recommended,\n\n331\n00:16:55.458 --> 00:16:56.868\nor encrypt the file only.\n\n332\n00:16:56.868 --> 00:17:00.937\nAnd you would almost just think\nto yourself, if it's recommended,\n\n333\n00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:05.861\nif it's not a good idea, if I shouldn't do\nit, why don't they just do it that way-\n\n334\n00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:06.760\n&gt;&gt; Make it the default.\n\n335\n00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.870\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's almost like,\nhey, are you hungry?\n\n336\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.720\nYes I am.\n\n337\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.320\nDo you wanna eat?\n\n338\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.190\nYes I do.\n\n339\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.145\nSo, are you sure you wanna eat?\n\n340\n00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:14.330\n[LAUGH] Are you really hungry?\n\n341\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.335\nNo, I'm not I'm just saying that\nbecause I've got nothing better to do.\n\n342\n00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:21.470\nI just wonder sometimes of just the people\nthat are thinking about these things.\n\n343\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.210\nIs there a business case where\nyou may want to do this anyway?\n\n344\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.020\nYeah, absolutely, I'm sure there is.\n\n345\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.610\nBut if you're gonna warn me and\n\n346\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.360\nsay it's a bad idea,\nwhy not just go ahead and do that.\n\n347\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.388\nAll right, so, encrypt the file and\nthe parent, or just encrypt the file.\n\n348\n00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:36.410\nWe're just gonna encrypt the file,\nwe don't really care about that.\n\n349\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.250\nRight, so click OK,\nback up your file encryption key.\n\n350\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.198\nNotice that that has come\nup as a warning there.\n\n351\n00:17:42.198 --> 00:17:45.200\nI don't know if you saw that,\nthat kind of popped up there.\n\n352\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.090\nAnd we'll see that right there,\nwe're gonna go in and\n\n353\n00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.970\ntake a look at that in just a second.\n\n354\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.010\nLet's just click OK and\nlet's just come back up out of here.\n\n355\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.550\nLet's take a look at our EFS test folder,\n\n356\n00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.070\nnotice that the ESF test\nfolder is still there.\n\n357\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.280\nLet's right click, would be a neat\ntrick if it was gone wouldn't it?\n\n358\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to advanced and\n\n359\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.300\nwe'll notice that there's no\nencryption attribute on the folder.\n\n360\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.330\nHas not been encrypted.\n\n361\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.641\nAs we said we did not want it encrypted so\nthat makes sense it should not be.\n\n362\n00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:20.800\nAnd then when we go in here if you can\nNotice it is now file is now encrypted.\n\n363\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.700\nIt's turned colors, it's now green.\n\n364\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.610\nGreen is the color for encryption,\nblue, if you ever see a blue file,\n\n365\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:32.440\nis the color for compression, because\nthings turn blue when you cut off oxygen.\n\n366\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.219\nSo I guess that's why they chose blue.\n\n367\n00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:35.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're squeezing it.\n\n368\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're squeezing it, exactly.\n\n369\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.860\nSo New Text Document is now encrypted.\n\n370\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.584\nAnd if we wanna work with that\nwe can right click of course,\n\n371\n00:18:42.584 --> 00:18:47.458\nwe can go to properties, we can see that\nit is encrypted we can go to details.\n\n372\n00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:52.709\nWe now have a new little interface\nin here that shows me that\n\n373\n00:18:52.709 --> 00:18:59.150\nI have essentially user access control\nlist for the new text document.\n\n374\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.110\nNow, by default and\n\n375\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.400\nby design, local administrator and/or\ndomain admins if you're a member of\n\n376\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.160\nthe domain are automatically made\nrecovery agents for EFS in Windows.\n\n377\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.024\nMeaning the admin account locally\nand/or the domain admin account group,\n\n378\n00:19:14.024 --> 00:19:17.824\ndomain administrators group,\nif we have joined a domain,\n\n379\n00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:22.688\nwe'll automatically be associated with\nevery file as essentially a master\n\n380\n00:19:22.688 --> 00:19:25.960\nrecovery backdoor scanning\nkey kind of function.\n\n381\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.316\nSo that if the owner of the file\nis removed from the system,\n\n382\n00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:33.450\nif they don't unencrypt the file\nwe still can go in and access it.\n\n383\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.150\nKnowing that as an investigator\nis also important.\n\n384\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.010\nThat gives us the ability to go in and to\nrecover files that are encrypted without\n\n385\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.990\nnecessarily having using user credentials\nas the admin, and we need to know that and\n\n386\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.910\nbe aware of that.\n\n387\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.490\nWe also have the access to recovery key,\n\n388\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.099\nthat thing that I said we're gonna\ngo take a look at on the sys tray.\n\n389\n00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:53.080\nThat prompts it,\nhey back up your recovery key.\n\n390\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.120\nWe're gonna find that\nin there in a second.\n\n391\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.580\nSo, you'll see that we could add\nusers in here if we wanted to,\n\n392\n00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.330\nobviously assigning\nthem rights to do this.\n\n393\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.960\nAnd if there are any recovery\ncertificates that had been added,\n\n394\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.110\nwe would see them listed here\nin the interface as well.\n\n395\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:12.560\nSo, we now that that is the case and\nnow we can open this file.\n\n396\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.570\nIf we have rights to do so, just by\ndouble clicking on it as you can see,\n\n397\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.990\nwe can put something in there.\n\n398\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.080\nWe can save it, we can close it.\n\n399\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.010\nCan open it back up and the data's there,\nbecause we are, or I am in the demo,\n\n400\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.390\nthe administrator, so I automatically\nhave rights, I'm the creator owner.\n\n401\n00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.670\nAnd I also happen that have rights\nas not only the creator owner but\n\n402\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.170\nas the recovery agent for\nthe file under EFS so I can see that.\n\n403\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.680\nSo, we can go in and do that, no problem.\n\n404\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.519\nBut if we log on as another user\nwithout rights we would not be able\n\n405\n00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.315\nto open the file.\n\n406\n00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:50.610\nSo that's part of the value and\nhe strength of encryption.\n\n407\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.830\nNow, if we come in here,\n\n408\n00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.960\ncan we go full screen cuz you can't\nsee what I'm, yeah, thank you,\n\n409\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.420\nwe can't see what I'm clicking on when I'm\nsitting over the screen talking to you.\n\n410\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.920\nI just came down to\nthe notification area down here and\n\n411\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.370\nwe got this little pop-up\nearlier that says hey,\n\n412\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.160\nencrypting file system back up\nyour file certificate and key.\n\n413\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.580\nAnd so we're able to go in and\nwe're able to back it up,\n\n414\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.450\nwe should backup the certificate and\nkey to removable media, so\n\n415\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.540\nwe may wanna do that,\nback it up later, or never back up.\n\n416\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.848\nAgain, you wonder about the option here,\nright?\n\n417\n00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:19.972\nNever back up, as in, hey,\nif you don't do this and\n\n418\n00:21:19.972 --> 00:21:24.880\nyou're not the authorized user,\nyou can't get into the system.\n\n419\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.687\nAnd neither does the failsafe mechanism,\n\n420\n00:21:26.687 --> 00:21:29.945\nand there is a reason you may want to do\nthat if you really want to hide the data,\n\n421\n00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:33.282\nyou're up to no good, and obviously you\ndon't want anybody to see it but you.\n\n422\n00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:35.297\nSo I understand why it's there, but\n\n423\n00:21:35.297 --> 00:21:39.098\nfor the average user they're\nnot going to operate that way.\n\n424\n00:21:39.098 --> 00:21:41.570\nSo we're gonna back up just to\nshow you want that looks like.\n\n425\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.510\nWe have a little welcome to\nthe certificate export wizard,\n\n426\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.130\nall good things in Windows\nare driven by wizards.\n\n427\n00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.440\nYou ever see the movie Wizards,\nby the way, with Ralph Bakshi?\n\n428\n00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.906\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You remember he was the animator\n\n429\n00:21:50.906 --> 00:21:52.533\nwho did Heavy Metal, right?\n\n430\n00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:53.150\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n431\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:53.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n432\n00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.920\nSo, you ever see Heavy Metal?\n\n433\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome movie.\n\n434\n00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.660\n&gt;&gt; I love Heavy Metal.\n&gt;&gt; So wizards is essentially like tolcon.\n\n435\n00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.390\nIt's kinda like Lord of the Rings, but\n\n436\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.600\nit's an animated as opposed to\na full action live or live action.\n\n437\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.970\nAlthough they did make an animated\nversion of Lord of the Rings.\n\n438\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:09.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a long time ago.\n\n439\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.479\n&gt;&gt; Very long time ago, wasn't as good.\n\n440\n00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:12.623\n&gt;&gt; Oddly enough,\n\n441\n00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:18.700\nthe gentleman that played Bilbo Baggins\nactually Bilbo Baggins in that version.\n\n442\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.090\nHe was the voice.\n\n443\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.039\n&gt;&gt; Really?\nThat I did not know.\n\n444\n00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:21.818\nI didn't know that.\n\n445\n00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:26.366\nBut, the Wizards the movie,\nWizards is essentially,\n\n446\n00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:29.750\nit's kind of like that kind of story.\n\n447\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.746\nIt's a battle, pretty typical\nbattle between good and evil.\n\n448\n00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:36.786\nAnimated, drawn by hand the same kind\nof drawing same kind of effects,\n\n449\n00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:39.390\nso to speak, you see in Heavy Metal.\n\n450\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.760\nSo it's a pretty cool movie\nif you haven't seen it.\n\n451\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.010\nAwesome, actually.\nReally, really good,\n\n452\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.152\nyou should definitely take a look.\n\n453\n00:22:44.152 --> 00:22:47.020\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna talk about backing up here.\n\n454\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.490\nSo exporting the, let me just zoom in.\n\n455\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.062\nSo we're gonna see here that\nwe can export the file form.\n\n456\n00:22:55.062 --> 00:22:58.660\nSo you'll see it's just a simple\nexport wizard for certificate.\n\n457\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.560\nYou'll notice we have the personal\ninformation exchange,\n\n458\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.740\nthe PKCS #12 .PFX,\nstandard for the certificate.\n\n459\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.013\nNotice we can include any and\nall certificates in the path, export any\n\n460\n00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:13.971\nextended properties, so you'll grab that\ninformation so we're going to do that.\n\n461\n00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:18.925\nWe'll just check those off,\nwe'll then go ahead and hot next,\n\n462\n00:23:18.925 --> 00:23:24.900\nput a password on there, in case we\nAre going to worry about security.\n\n463\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.022\nPut a complex password on there abc one,\ntwo,\n\n464\n00:23:27.022 --> 00:23:29.262\nthree all lower case\n[SOUND] don't tell anybody.\n\n465\n00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:31.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always keep password security, very,\n\n466\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.590\nvery important.\n\n467\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.780\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nbrowse and put that somewhere.\n\n468\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.520\nI always throw this kind of stuff on\nthe desktop when I am doing demos and\n\n469\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.000\nthings like that just so I know where\nthere ar, it's easy to work with.\n\n470\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.150\nIn the real world obviously,\nyou wouldn't do this out on the desktop,\n\n471\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.670\nyou would put it somewhere secure.\n\n472\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.180\nTypically as they recommend and maybe\nto an external media device like USB,\n\n473\n00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.570\nhave that portable take it somewhere\nmark it, store it, put it in a vault or\n\n474\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.775\nwhatever you gonna do with it.\n\n475\n00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:54.213\nBut, for purposes the demonstration,\n\n476\n00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:56.589\nwere just gonna to thew with it on\nthe desktop to know how to find it.\n\n477\n00:23:56.589 --> 00:24:01.375\nSo, I'm gonna call this,\njust Adam1, so we know what it is.\n\n478\n00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:06.961\nIt's saved, hit Next, hit Finish,\nexport was successful.\n\n479\n00:24:06.961 --> 00:24:08.645\nGot our little.\n\n480\n00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:13.780\nExport right there Adam1 envelope key,\nso we can see that.\n\n481\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.440\nAnd so now if we need to grab that and\n\n482\n00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.720\nimport that somewhere to be\nable to recover the file.\n\n483\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.030\nWe would have a copy of the file,\ncopy of the certificate key.\n\n484\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.260\nWe could import that, and\nthen we would be able to use that and\n\n485\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.880\nopen up and actually read.\n\n486\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.680\nThe file if necessary earning\ncrypt essentially, right?\n\n487\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.070\nSo this is how EFS works,\nencrypting file system.\n\n488\n00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.490\nThe issues with EFS,\n\n489\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.070\nright, you gotta understand that\nthis is kind of older technology.\n\n490\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.940\nIn Windows, this is Windows 2000 for\n\n491\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.330\nour actually Windows I want\nto actually say even NT 4.\n\n492\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.610\nI don't remember if EFS was actually\nin NT 4, it may have been 2000,\n\n493\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.820\nI think, when it first started.\n\n494\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.010\nBut certainly from 2000 forward.\n\n495\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.250\nAnd we've had it, and\nwe can still certainly even use it today.\n\n496\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.610\nBut we're making way for things like\nBitLocker now, full drive encryption.\n\n497\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.060\nDone a little bit differently,\nsticky attributes that will stick to\n\n498\n00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.020\nthe encryption of the drive, or\nthe attributes of the drive,\n\n499\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.530\ninstead of single file, and\nwill stay with the drive wherever it goes.\n\n500\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.140\nIt's a much more robust\nprotection mechanism.\n\n501\n00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.290\nSo we see a migration away from these\nfiles system-dependent file and\n\n502\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:22.400\nfolder directory level solutions in\nearly versions of Windows Into entire\n\n503\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.060\nplatform specific, or excuse me,\nplatform wide encryption scenarios.\n\n504\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:33.240\nAnd BitLocker,\nstarting with Windows Vista,\n\n505\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.880\nmaybe Windows 7, certainly by Windows 8,\n8.1, and Windows 10, today.\n\n506\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.920\nWe see that on the service side,\nServer 12 R2, Server 16.\n\n507\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.640\nWe see the use of BitLocker.\n\n508\n00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.940\nAs being a very good, very strong,\nvery robust way of doing whole drive,\n\n509\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.090\nwhole disc, whole instance encryption.\n\n510\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.400\nBut, like anything else\nfrom a forensic standpoint,\n\n511\n00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.230\nwe have to understand how\nto deal with those as well.\n\n512\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.140\nSimilar concept.\n\n513\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.290\nThe drive's encrypted.\n\n514\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.630\nWe can make a bitstream copy, but\n\n515\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.670\nwe're getting random scrambled\ngarbage without the recovery key and\n\n516\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.840\nthe ability to interact with that,\nto be able to see the data.\n\n517\n00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.846\nSo we do have to understand that.\n\n518\n00:26:05.846 --> 00:26:09.440\nWe're not going to go into all the\nspecifics in this conversation about hey,\n\n519\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.560\nwe've got an encrypted drive.\n\n520\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.880\nWhat do we do to see the data?\n\n521\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.100\nHow do we crack that encryption.\n\n522\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.740\nIt's a little bit out beyond\nour conversations here.\n\n523\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.660\nBut are there tools, are there mechanisms,\n\n524\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.310\nare there techniques that may, underscore\nmay, may or may not be able to do that?\n\n525\n00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.978\nAbsolutely.\n\n526\n00:26:22.978 --> 00:26:26.800\nIt's going to depend on a variety of\nfactors, how strong the encryption is,\n\n527\n00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.640\nhow big the workspace is, how big the keys\nor the work factor rather, how long\n\n528\n00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.420\nthe work factor is, how many years it\nwill take, how big the key space is,\n\n529\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.240\nhow many key combinations potentially\nyou use, how strong the encryption is.\n\n530\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.000\nIn other words,\nif we use an RSA algorithm with a 2048 or\n\n531\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.730\n4096 bit key, it's very unlikely that\nwe're going to be cracking that encryption\n\n532\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.300\nin our lifetime or in the lifetimes of\nmany, many generations out in front of us\n\n533\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.900\nunless we get incredibly lucky,\nor we make a mistake.\n\n534\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.450\nAnd in so doing, allow for a repetition of\nthe key or some sort of issue that could\n\n535\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.750\nbe used to hack essentially and\nbreak the encryption, to occur.\n\n536\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.130\nYet we've talked extensively about\nencryption and cryptography,\n\n537\n00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.700\nthought processes in other areas of\nother shows not related to CHFI,\n\n538\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.620\nI talk about it in CEH a little bit.\n\n539\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.795\nWe do a very extensive\ndrill down on it in CASP,\n\n540\n00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:20.695\ndo a very extensive drill down on\nit in the CompTIA CASP solution.\n\n541\n00:27:20.695 --> 00:27:23.145\nAlso, in the ISC squared CISSP\n\n542\n00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:26.265\nsolution we do a pretty thorough\nconversation around cryptography.\n\n543\n00:27:26.265 --> 00:27:30.397\nI think we did kind of a high level one in\nthe cloud security stuff you and I did.\n\n544\n00:27:30.397 --> 00:27:33.267\nBut it probably wasn't as thorough as some\nof the stuff we did in the other areas.\n\n545\n00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:36.607\nBut any and all of those would be good\nthings for you to maybe take a look at.\n\n546\n00:27:36.607 --> 00:27:39.567\nJust think about if you're watching\nus here, now talking about this and\n\n547\n00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:41.457\nsaying yeah,\nI'd like to learn a little bit more.\n\n548\n00:27:41.457 --> 00:27:44.157\nI'd like to know a little bit more\nabout that whole encryption thing.\n\n549\n00:27:44.157 --> 00:27:47.627\nI've definitely got that information for\nyou in another series of episodes and\n\n550\n00:27:47.627 --> 00:27:51.067\nshows but you've gotta go outside\nof CHFI and look at it there.\n\n551\n00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:52.810\nAnd I encourage you to\nthink about doing that.\n\n552\n00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.020\nTake full advantage of that\nIT Pro TV subscription you have, and\n\n553\n00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.900\nlook at some of the other things in\nthe library, and take advantage of\n\n554\n00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.130\nsome of that great content that not\nonly Daniel but many of our other hosts,\n\n555\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.810\nmyself and others, have been\nincluded in having to make for you.\n\n556\n00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.670\nIt's always good stuff when\nyou get a chance to do that,\n\n557\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.150\nso might want to just\ninvite you to do that.\n\n558\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.310\nSo encryption,\nvery important to be aware of.\n\n559\n00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.150\nThe Windows registry,\n\n560\n00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.650\nalso something else that we just want to\nat least have a passing familiarity with.\n\n561\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.490\nWe're going to deep dive into the registry\nin some of our conversations in\n\n562\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.520\nupcoming shows.\n\n563\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.250\nLook at and talk about a whole\nbunch of different registry keys\n\n564\n00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.440\nthat you may want to be aware of.\n\n565\n00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.570\nThere are some wickedly stuff cool stuff\nyou can pull out of the registry if\n\n566\n00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.020\nyou know where to look and\nyou know what to look for.\n\n567\n00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.843\nBut just getting in there,\ngetting comfortable with it,\n\n568\n00:28:33.843 --> 00:28:34.670\nis going to be important.\n\n569\n00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.730\nCan we go back to the machine here for\njust a second if you will?\n\n570\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:43.690\nJust something as simple as knowing how\nto get into the registry, Regedit32.\n\n571\n00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:49.520\nLet me just bring that back up for\njust a second so that you can\n\n572\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.330\nsee what I typed there, because you may or\nmay not be familiar with that, regedt32.\n\n573\n00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.190\nPeople always, I say regedit.\n\n574\n00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.420\nThey're like, regedit, E-D-I-T.\n\n575\n00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.390\nIt's not working, why is it not working?\n\n576\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.180\nBecause the people that figured that\nout said, no, they don't need the I.\n\n577\n00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.240\nLeave that out of there.\n\n578\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.500\nJust do regedt32 without the I.\n\n579\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.950\nSo regedt32 is one way to\nbring up the registry.\n\n580\n00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.200\nNow if you bring up regedt32 you\nwill get this registry editor.\n\n581\n00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.520\nOne that I happen to like because\nit does obviously allows to go in,\n\n582\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.760\nit does have some pretty significant\nsearch features, find, find next.\n\n583\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.100\nWe can import and export keys,\n\n584\n00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.430\nwe can connect remotely out to another\nsystem we'll get the registry there.\n\n585\n00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.940\nSo remote registry, reading and\nhacking is always a good thing.\n\n586\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.560\nSo we have that version\nof the registry editor.\n\n587\n00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.300\nAnd then, woops we can\n\n588\n00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.840\ndo regedit,\nwhich also brings up the same one,\n\n589\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.540\njust do regedit32 or regedit,\nessentially will be the same either way.\n\n590\n00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.620\nYou can go in and do that, and so\neither command will bring this up and\n\n591\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.460\nI like this one.\n\n592\n00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.740\nThere are a lot of others, there's\nothers third party registry editors, and\n\n593\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.720\nother tools you can use.\n\n594\n00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.080\nA whole bunch of them.\n\n595\n00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.070\nBut this one is the general one,\nthe built in one for Microsoft.\n\n596\n00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.580\nAnd it lets us go in.\n\n597\n00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.122\nThere are five major areas that\nwe talked about in the registry.\n\n598\n00:30:03.122 --> 00:30:05.450\nAnd again,\nwe'll document these in an upcoming show,\n\n599\n00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.060\ntalk about them in more depth with you.\n\n600\n00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.860\nBut you can see classes root,\ncurrent user, local machine, HKEY users,\n\n601\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.610\nand current config all sitting over here.\n\n602\n00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.990\nThese are the five areas of\nthe registry that we focus on.\n\n603\n00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.820\nAnd we drill down into them\ndepending on what we're looking for.\n\n604\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.780\nAnd as I said, there are some incredible\nstuff that's buried in there that\n\n605\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.340\nmost people have no knowledge of.\n\n606\n00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.750\nThey really don't know exist.\n\n607\n00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.040\nWe can go and\nlook at any aspect of the system.\n\n608\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.400\nWe can look at how you're saving things,\nwhat you're\n\n609\n00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.970\nlast 20 commands where they were type into\nthe dos shell if you're using a run line.\n\n610\n00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.860\nLook at all the files you've opened.\n\n611\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.360\nWe can look at the file\nextensions you have mapped.\n\n612\n00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.090\nLook at the URL's you've\nbeen visiting in the web and\n\n613\n00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.030\nall the files that are gathered from that.\n\n614\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.730\nThere's just so\nmuch stuff that gets transposed and\n\n615\n00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.050\nrecorded in there that people are not\naware of, or just don't think about.\n\n616\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.640\nAnd as an investigator we're going to\nwant to have knowledge of that and\n\n617\n00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.958\nobviously go in and take a look at that.\n\n618\n00:30:56.958 --> 00:31:00.140\nIt's going to be very important for\nus to be thinking about that,\n\n619\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.620\nand you'll know what's going on in there.\n\n620\n00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.660\nWe'll be taking a look in more depth and\ngoing in there a little bit.\n\n621\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.160\nWe also want to think about Linux.\n\n622\n00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.660\nNever want to leave Linux out when we're\nhaving a conversation even if it is\n\n623\n00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.620\njust on the surface.\n\n624\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.818\nYou know we do have Linux based system.\n\n625\n00:31:12.818 --> 00:31:15.270\nDaniel mentioned in one\nof the prior discussions\n\n626\n00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.560\nwe were having with what kind\nof file systems are out there.\n\n627\n00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.380\nHe mentioned ext, ext2 and\next3 are Linux file systems.\n\n628\n00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.660\nExt is not really used much anymore\nit's kind of older, you see ext2 and or\n\n629\n00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.520\next3, Mainly EXT3 as being\nthe standard today, but\n\n630\n00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.330\nthis is going to allow us to\nhave the file system in Linux.\n\n631\n00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.360\nA little bit different, we use iNodes as\nthe building block in Linux as opposed\n\n632\n00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.648\nto the way we do it in Windows.\n\n633\n00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:44.210\nWhen iNode is a basic building block, each\nfile or directory is described by a single\n\n634\n00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.200\niNode, and we group them together\nin what we call an iNode table.\n\n635\n00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.505\nSo you thought Apple was the only\none that had i-everything, right?\n\n636\n00:31:50.505 --> 00:31:51.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n637\n00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.530\nby the way Linux has been doing it a lot\nlonger than Apple has, right, just so\n\n638\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.290\nyou know.\n\n639\n00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.280\nSo if we are in EXT2, and we move to EXT3,\n\n640\n00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.330\ncan we convert the EXT2\nto EXT3 file system?\n\n641\n00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.900\nAbsolutely, there is a command for\nthat like there is a command for\n\n642\n00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.660\neverything else.\n\n643\n00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.790\nWe've got the command for you,\nsitting in the show notes.\n\n644\n00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.480\nTake a look at that if you're interested.\n\n645\n00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.260\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n646\n00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.470\nYou just have to use the command tune,\nTFS with a J option and then the partition\n\n647\n00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.800\nname that you want to convert, and you'll\nbe To be able to go from ext2 to ext3.\n\n648\n00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.670\nThe MacOS X file system.\n\n649\n00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.190\nWe've got that as well.\n\n650\n00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.550\nDaniel's favorite one,\ncuz that's what he uses.\n\n651\n00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:33.008\nSo we can use HFS and/or H,\nwell I'm just being facetious.\n\n652\n00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:36.555\nOr HFS OS plus,\nwhich is Mac OS extended, right?\n\n653\n00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:38.675\nThere's also the Unix file system,\nthe UFS.\n\n654\n00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:42.165\nThere's a lot of different ones out\nthere depending on what you do.\n\n655\n00:32:42.165 --> 00:32:45.455\nHFS Plus sets up volumes\ndivided into logical blocks,\n\n656\n00:32:45.455 --> 00:32:49.515\nwhat we would commonly call sectors, 512\nbytes each, much like we do in Windows.\n\n657\n00:32:49.515 --> 00:32:53.275\nWe cluster those into\nallocation blocks in HFS Plus.\n\n658\n00:32:53.275 --> 00:32:57.065\nThe number of allocation blocks is\ndependent on the volume size, so\n\n659\n00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:58.440\nit's dependent there.\n\n660\n00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.570\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n661\n00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.180\nBut again,\nwe have a similar kind of structure.\n\n662\n00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.900\nWe have seven distinct sectors or\ntypes of sectors in HFS+.\n\n663\n00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.090\nWe'll run through them for you quickly.\n\n664\n00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.430\nUser file fork,\nallocation file, catalog file,\n\n665\n00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:20.440\nextent overflow file, attribute file\nstart up files and our new space.\n\n666\n00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.130\nThose are the 7 types of sectors that\nexist in CHFI pass.Again maybe helpful\n\n667\n00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.580\nto be aware of those and\nhave a sense of those.\n\n668\n00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.170\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n669\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.120\nAnd although we're not going\nto talk about it right now,\n\n670\n00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.230\nwe are going to have a discussion\non RAID and how RAID works and\n\n671\n00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.490\nDaniel's actually going to help me do\na cool little demo for you with RAID.\n\n672\n00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.100\nAnd we're going to take a look at a pretty\nlittle picture, that you didn't do?\n\n673\n00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.240\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I think I did that one.\n\n674\n00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.780\n&gt;&gt; So Dano drew the picture\nwe're going to take a look at.\n\n675\n00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.410\nWe'll take a look at that coming up and\ntalk about RAID and how RAID works to wrap\n\n676\n00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.670\nup our discussions with regards\nto hard drives and file systems.\n\n677\n00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.500\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n678\n00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.410\nI'm seeing a lot of cool things we\nneed to know about file systems.\n\n679\n00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.530\nFor our duties as a CHFI.\n\n680\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.310\nSo being very familiar with different file\nsystems on a different on a different\n\n681\n00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.140\noperating systems, how they work,\nhow we interact with them and\n\n682\n00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.700\neven how a bad guy might be using\nthem to their own advantage.\n\n683\n00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.370\nAnd the we needing to uncover that,\nis definitely, the alternative dream.\n\n684\n00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.530\nThat's just cool,\nthat's wizardry in my book.\n\n685\n00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.080\nThat being said, looks like we run out\nof time for this episode Adam, thanks so\n\n686\n00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.660\nmuch for stopping by again today.\n\n687\n00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.130\nWe thank you for watching but\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n688\n00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.390\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n689\n00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:27.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm an alternate data stream.\n\n690\n00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.679\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n691\n00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:36.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n692\n00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:38.901\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.218\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:11.970\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.126\nAll right.\n\n6\n00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:16.970\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.261\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we're back for\n\n8\n00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:21.970\nmore on our CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.320\nAnd joining us back yet\nagain, finishing up,\n\n10\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.000\nrounding out if you will,\nour discussion on hard drives and\n\n11\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.600\nfile systems as well,\nis our good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.512\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:33.190\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n14\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.780\nRounding out,\nkind of like a platter is round,\n\n15\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.640\nlike a theme we can progress\nforward with and carry on.\n\n16\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.740\nI am doing well, hopefully you are also.\n\n17\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.050\nSo Daniel was kind enough to invite\nme back, A because we had to\n\n18\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.290\nfinish talking about this topic and\nB, because he's camera shy and\n\n19\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.210\ndoesn't want to talk about RAID,\nso he said, you have to do it.\n\n20\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.600\nSo I said, all right I'll come back and\ndo it, but I struck a deal with him.\n\n21\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.760\nHe's gonna actually play Vanna White for\nme here and\n\n22\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.610\nhelp me do a little physical, as well\nas logical demonstration of RAID as we\n\n23\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.400\ntalk about how to build some\ndifferent RAID options.\n\n24\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.830\nAnd Daniel's gonna be the masterful\nset of hands behind the scene,\n\n25\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.870\nthat moves those hard drives for\nus as we talk about how this works.\n\n26\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.720\nAt least that's the plan.\n\n27\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.990\nWe'll see how that goes.\n\n28\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.170\nAnd whether that works or not.\n\n29\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.820\n&gt;&gt; Wish I would have had foreknowledge,\nI would have brought my evening wear.\n\n30\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.681\n&gt;&gt; Or at least a set of gloves then you\nwould have been able to do just cuz if we\n\n31\n00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.570\nshow you from the hand down,\nthen it wouldn't really matter.\n\n32\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.580\nYou could wear the dress,\nnobody would know.\n\n33\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Nobody does.\n&gt;&gt; What do you wear for\n\n34\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.470\nthis time of the year?\n\n35\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.270\nWhat would be an appropriate evening\nwear color for this time of the year?\n\n36\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.340\n&gt;&gt; I guess some sort of black.\n\n37\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.255\n&gt;&gt; I don't think black's ever-\n&gt;&gt; Out of style?\n\n38\n00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think it's ever out, I\njust don't know if it's a seasonal thing.\n\n39\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.543\nI was thinking more like it's the-\n&gt;&gt; I noticed the ladies around here wear\n\n40\n00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:40.360\nmore dark colors.\n\n41\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.193\n&gt;&gt; Dark?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:41.193 --> 00:01:44.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that could just have\nto do with a variety of things.\n\n43\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not just seasonal\n\n44\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.080\nstuff, who knows?\n\n45\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.330\nBut all right, fair enough.\n\n46\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.510\nSo Daniel's gonna pretend to be wearing\na dark evening dress and a pair of gloves,\n\n47\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.790\nand we're gonna talk about RAID.\n\n48\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.270\nSo when we speak about RAID,\nredundant array\n\n49\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.780\nof inexpensive and/or independent disks,\nyou can translate that as you will.\n\n50\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.160\nYou often hear people\nrefer to it either way.\n\n51\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.960\nThe idea is that we are linking\ntogether one or more hard drives.\n\n52\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.844\nWe're gonna talk about typically at\nleast using one to create a stripe set,\n\n53\n00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.456\nusually minimum of one.\n\n54\n00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:16.880\nWe really can't do it with one,\nwe need two.\n\n55\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.660\nWe could, in theory, put data on one but\n\n56\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.990\nwe don't really talk about\nit as being a RAID solution.\n\n57\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.754\nSo we really need at least two.\n\n58\n00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:27.750\nWe'll talk about two or\nmore drives brought together logically\n\n59\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.930\nconnected with software and/or if\nwe're doing it through hardware,\n\n60\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.090\nperhaps hardware based RAID controllers.\n\n61\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720\nBut we're just going to focus on the\nconcept as opposed to the architectural\n\n62\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.940\nspecificity of hey,\n\n63\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.080\nwe're going to use this hardware solution\nand we need this kind of a controller.\n\n64\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.460\nWe're not really worried about that,\nright?\n\n65\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.830\nThat maybe important\nin some conversations.\n\n66\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.770\nNot important for this conversation.\n\n67\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.250\nSo, when we think about\nRAID storage solutions,\n\n68\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.020\nwe think about there\nare many kinds of RAID.\n\n69\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.590\nBut we think about several that are very\ntraditional, also usually very common and\n\n70\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.555\nthat the investigator,\nthe CHFI would want to have knowledge of.\n\n71\n00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:04.486\nRAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and/or RAID 10,\nwhich is as we'll come to know,\n\n72\n00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:06.455\na combination of RAID 1 and 0.\n\n73\n00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:11.119\nIt's often written out as RAID 1+0,\nwe just commonly call it RAID 10, or\n\n74\n00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.975\nRAID 0+1.\n\n75\n00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:15.185\nYou see,\nand/or hear it refered to different ways.\n\n76\n00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.885\nBut either way, we'll talk about that.\n\n77\n00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:19.690\nSo let's start with RAID 0,\nWhen we think about RAID 0,\n\n78\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.600\nas I was just mentioning a moment ago,\nwe think about a striped set.\n\n79\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.766\nA traditional striped set is going to be\na minimum of two physical hard drives\n\n80\n00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:29.370\nbrought together.\n\n81\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.240\nMaximum typically of 32 for\n\n82\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.210\ndoing it through software in a Windows\noperating system, for instance.\n\n83\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.690\nThis may vary a little bit if\nwe're doing it with hardware.\n\n84\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.580\nBut let's assume we're just gonna\nsay a standard of between 2 and\n\n85\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.305\n32 physical drives, each drive may be\nbigger and/or smaller than the other,\n\n86\n00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:51.120\nbut the problem with a striped set will\nbe, we use the lowest common denominator.\n\n87\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.950\nAnd so if we have several drives that have\nat least 500 gigabytes of free space and\n\n88\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.900\none that has only 250 and\nwe make a stripe set,\n\n89\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.950\nour stripe set cannot be larger than 250\ngigabytes per drive across the array.\n\n90\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.040\nBecause it's the lowest amount of free\nspace in the stripe set that sets the,\n\n91\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.670\nif you will, specification, right, for\nthe stripe per drive across the set.\n\n92\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.220\nSo we just want to be aware of that.\n\n93\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.170\nWe also want to know\nthat with stripe sets,\n\n94\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.280\nwe are creating 64\nkilobit stripes of data.\n\n95\n00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.600\nThink about taking a paint brush.\n\n96\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.540\nProbably the easiest way\nto create a visual for you.\n\n97\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.940\nAnd if we're going to take data and\n\n98\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.830\nstripe it we're gonna dip our\nbrush in the data, Liquid Data.\n\n99\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.550\nAlmost like Flex Seal, liquid rubber.\n\n100\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.750\nBut instead it's Liquid Data you can\npaint it across your computers and\n\n101\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.090\nnot only will it seal, but also will give\nyou the benefit of information storage.\n\n102\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.250\nWe should market that.\n\n103\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.201\nIt's almost as cool.\n\n104\n00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:42.719\n&gt;&gt; Just like that way it sounds.\n\n105\n00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:43.379\n&gt;&gt; It's Coconet.\n\n106\n00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.245\nWhen Mike and I came up with Coconet and\nHurricane Pete's.\n\n107\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.665\n&gt;&gt; Hurricane Pete's was you and I, yeah.\n\n108\n00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:50.365\n&gt;&gt; You and I came up with that, right,\nbut Mike and I came up with Coconet.\n\n109\n00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:52.394\nThat would be, we should put that\non the list with Liquid Data.\n\n110\n00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:53.950\n&gt;&gt; Our storage facility's\ngonna be called Liquid Data.\n\n111\n00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.541\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be cool.\n\n112\n00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.071\nRemember, we get 10% of\nanything you take and\n\n113\n00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:02.495\nactually come up with based on our crazy\nand wacky conversations here at ITPro.TV.\n\n114\n00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:03.955\nSo we are gonna stripe our data,\n\n115\n00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:06.880\nwe're gonna dip our paintbrush\ninto our liquid data.\n\n116\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.290\nPaint 64 kilobit stripes across\nall the drives in the stripe set.\n\n117\n00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.570\nGet to the end of that line, it's almost\nlike an old fashioned typewriter.\n\n118\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.070\nDing, right?\n\n119\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.730\nYou gotta make the ding sound, ding!\n\n120\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.546\nAnd then we go back and\nwe start again and go across and\n\n121\n00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.477\nwe're striping like this as we go.\n\n122\n00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:24.650\n64 kilobits of data in a stripe\nacross two or more hard drives.\n\n123\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.010\nNow the challenge with the stripe set with\nRAID 0 is that there is no fall tolerance,\n\n124\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.940\nthere is no resistance\nto hardware failure.\n\n125\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.900\nMeaning if we stripe across two or\nmore drives and\n\n126\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.450\nwe do so, putting our data there, one of\nthe physical hard drives were to fail, all\n\n127\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.410\nof our data in the stripe set would become\ninaccessible, would be unavailable to us,\n\n128\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.700\nunless we had a backup of it,\nwe had an alternate copy somewhere else.\n\n129\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.408\nWe could access it that way.\n\n130\n00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:53.700\nBut stripe set itself would be broken,\nand the data would be compromised.\n\n131\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.880\nWe would no longer be able to get into it.\n\n132\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.180\nSo we just want to be aware of that and\nunderstand that there is no\n\n133\n00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.280\nfault tolerance associated with\na RAID level 0 stripe set.\n\n134\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.590\nJust something to think about,\nsomething to consider.\n\n135\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.790\nFault tolerance is the ability for\nus to sustain a hardware based failure.\n\n136\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.780\nFailure of one of the members\nof the stripe set, or\n\n137\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.700\none of the members of the system,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n138\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.130\nAnd yet still be able to operate,\n\n139\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.780\nstill be able to give you access to the\ndata as a user or a consumer of that data.\n\n140\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.850\nCertain RAID levels have fault tolerance\nassociated with them, others do not.\n\n141\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.140\nRAID level 0 would simply be a stripe set.\n\n142\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.480\nCan we, if we wanna take a look, if we\ncould just briefly go to my machine just\n\n143\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.140\nfor one second, we'll show you a picture\nof what a stripe set may look like.\n\n144\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.830\nWe have each one of these cylindrical\nobjects represents hard drive.\n\n145\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.330\nLet's just say for a minute, if a stripe\nset was made up of at least two, or\n\n146\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.100\nperhaps three, hard drives,\nwe would see our data\n\n147\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.540\nacross the drives in these banded\nobjects that are sitting here.\n\n148\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.060\nIf each one of them was 64\nkilobits in size, two or\n\n149\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.470\nmore would equal a traditional\nRAID 0 stripe set.\n\n150\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.640\nJust so you know what that looks like.\n\n151\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.200\nAll right, very good.\n\n152\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.300\nLet me do this, No, wait, wait.\n\n153\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.120\nThere we go.\nOkay, there was like a delay.\n\n154\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.740\nThere's a small,\n\n155\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.170\nlittle latency issue associated with our\nbeing able to pull back out of that one.\n\n156\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.180\nAll right, so that's RAID level 0,\nwhat about RAID level 1?\n\n157\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.420\nRAID level 1,\ntraditionally known as a drive mirror.\n\n158\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.800\nNow RAID level 1 is kind of interesting,\n\n159\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.950\nit does give us the traditional\nconcept of RAID.\n\n160\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.602\nThe ability to send our data to,\nin this case,\n\n161\n00:07:18.602 --> 00:07:23.165\ntwo distinct hard drives bit it adds the\nability for us to have fault tolerance.\n\n162\n00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:27.920\nAnd so with a drive mirror, we are writing\nour data to both drives simultaneously.\n\n163\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.210\nThink of essentially a Y-controller.\n\n164\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.830\nLiterally just a fork in the road.\n\n165\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.360\nIf we kinda do this, get it even,\nlevel my hands out, and you get the idea.\n\n166\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.190\nKinda like this.\n\n167\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.060\nLook, two hands clapping in the forest.\n\n168\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.220\nDo they make noise?\n\n169\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.151\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; That's the eternal question.\n\n170\n00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But are you there?\n\n171\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.670\nWait, let me do, no no,\nwait, go back, go back.\n\n172\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.567\nBut do they,\nnot only do they make noise, but [SOUND]\n\n173\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.670\n&gt;&gt; I can hear them.\n\n174\n00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.340\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I can hear them.\n\n175\n00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.075\n&gt;&gt; Do they have jazz hands?\n\n176\n00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:51.640\n&gt;&gt; They have jazz.\n\n177\n00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.269\n&gt;&gt; Jazz hands!\n\n178\n00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:53.683\nOkay, anyway, so-\n&gt;&gt; Like Fosse.\n\n179\n00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:56.133\n&gt;&gt; So RAID level 1 with drive mirrors.\n\n180\n00:07:56.133 --> 00:08:00.243\nThe drive mirror, we use a controller\nto write to both drives simultaneously.\n\n181\n00:08:00.243 --> 00:08:02.600\nThe data appears in both\nplaces at the same time.\n\n182\n00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.540\nAs a result,\nthe data is going to be available to us.\n\n183\n00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.564\nNow if, again we're doing this\nwith software and/or hardware,\n\n184\n00:08:08.564 --> 00:08:11.588\ndepending on how it's set up,\nif there is a hardware controller,\n\n185\n00:08:11.588 --> 00:08:13.435\nthe process may be slightly different.\n\n186\n00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.625\nIf it's a software controller\nthe process may be slightly different,\n\n187\n00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.070\nwe may have to break the mirror.\n\n188\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.493\nBreaking the mirror is the concept of, if\nwe have a drive failure, failing over from\n\n189\n00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:26.192\nthe primary drive to the alternate\ndrive to be able to access the data.\n\n190\n00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:29.309\nThis may happen automatically,\nthere may be a manual process involved,\n\n191\n00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:31.460\nit depends on the nature\nof the technology.\n\n192\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.320\nI think we were gonna show the kind\nfolks out there in our ITPro.TV audience\n\n193\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.060\nhow to actually create a drive\nmirror using our overhead.\n\n194\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.225\nI'm gonna move my mouse out of the way,\nso we are not obstructing that.\n\n195\n00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.650\nSo what would a drive mirror look like,\nyou may say?\n\n196\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.470\nLet's go to our overhead and take a look.\n\n197\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.220\nAll right, so we have one drive, right?\n\n198\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.860\nI feel like to count on Sesame Street,\ndrive, one drive, ha-ha.\n\n199\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.118\nNow we have two drives,\ntwo drives, ha-ha-ha.\n\n200\n00:08:58.118 --> 00:08:59.890\nAnd what do we have,\nwe have the two drives.\n\n201\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.150\nAnd so the mirror would\nessentially allow us to connect.\n\n202\n00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.876\nYeah, I was gonna say level those up.\n\n203\n00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.056\n&gt;&gt; Just slide it there.\n\n204\n00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:06.199\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n205\n00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:10.395\nAll right, and so allows us to\nconnect both drives together, and\n\n206\n00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:13.540\nwe would write data to\nboth simultaneously.\n\n207\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.360\nData appears in both places at once.\n\n208\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.253\nNow, interestingly,\nwith RAID 1 with a drive mirror,\n\n209\n00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:20.012\nwe are mirroring the hard drives.\n\n210\n00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:22.201\nBut what about this mythical\nthing called the controller,\n\n211\n00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.285\nthat we keep talking about?\n\n212\n00:09:23.285 --> 00:09:25.660\nLet's say that our\ncontroller is right here.\n\n213\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.020\nWe'll put that there to represent the\nability to write to both drives at once.\n\n214\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.310\nIf we have a drive failure,\nlet's say, we remove that drive.\n\n215\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.000\nThe controller and the drive that\nis left are still there, and\n\n216\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.040\nwe can access the data.\n\n217\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.480\nBut if both drives are good, and\nthe controller were to fail.\n\n218\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.924\nRemove the controller, kind sir,\nwe have a problem, right?\n\n219\n00:09:46.924 --> 00:09:50.345\nBecause although the drive is\nresident on both physical devices,\n\n220\n00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:51.942\nwe have no way of getting to it.\n\n221\n00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:55.507\nThe controller, the hardware\ninterface that the motherboard and\n\n222\n00:09:55.507 --> 00:09:57.487\nthe drives use to talk to each other.\n\n223\n00:09:57.487 --> 00:10:00.894\nOr again, if it's external in\na hardware array, the external box,\n\n224\n00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:02.500\nthe interface, the hardware.\n\n225\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.339\nIf the controller itself were to fail,\n\n226\n00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:06.920\nwe would still have\na single point of failure.\n\n227\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.728\nSo we talk about RAID level 1,\nor hard drive mirror.\n\n228\n00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:12.490\nWe also talk about RAID\nlevel 1 with duplexing.\n\n229\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.135\nDuplexing is the ability to be able to,\nthere seems to be a small almost\n\n230\n00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:21.327\nlike a minor eclipse happening\nin association to hard drives.\n\n231\n00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:22.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very little room.\n\n232\n00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.754\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As you kinda bob it and weave it,\n\n233\n00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:26.800\nI could the shadow coming back and forth.\n\n234\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.307\nSo we talk about duplexing.\n\n235\n00:10:28.307 --> 00:10:31.806\nRAID level 1 with duplexing is not\njust mirroring the drives, but\n\n236\n00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:33.314\nmirroring our controller.\n\n237\n00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:35.402\nAdding an additional controller, so\n\n238\n00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:38.150\nessentially each drive\ntalks to one controller.\n\n239\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.989\nIf one were to fail, we could cable over,\nphysically or logically fail over.\n\n240\n00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:45.938\nAnd we add an extra layer of fault\ntolerance, extra layer of survivability,\n\n241\n00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:46.900\ninto the mix.\n\n242\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.895\nSo we just wanna be aware of RAID level 1,\n\n243\n00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:51.930\ndrive mirroring and/or RAID\nlevel 1 plus duplexing.\n\n244\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.610\nAnd the ability to be able to add\nadditional layers of fault tolerance.\n\n245\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.468\nNow, as with all layers of RAID in\ngeneral, we wanna keep in mind that what\n\n246\n00:10:58.468 --> 00:11:01.460\nwe're really talking about\nare distinctions that, for\n\n247\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.033\nthe CHFI, for the forensics investigator,\nhypothetically are important, right?\n\n248\n00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:09.738\nWe need to know that data had\nbeen mirrored to a hard drive.\n\n249\n00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:13.520\nBecause we wanna know that there is more\nthan one physical drive that will have\n\n250\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.980\ndata, or a copy of the data, that we\ncould interact with, and should take\n\n251\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:22.130\na forensically sound bit-by-bit copy of,\nto ensure we have all the information.\n\n252\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.130\nAll of the data, all of the evidence\npertinent to us in that system.\n\n253\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.600\nLet me give you a hypothetical,\nwhy it's so important for\n\n254\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.900\nus to understand the drives\nhave been mirrored.\n\n255\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.440\nDrives mirrored, as we said, are gonna\nwrite identical data to both drives.\n\n256\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.890\nBut there is slack space, as we've talked\nabout, or white space available in drives.\n\n257\n00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.470\nWhat if we manipulate the white\nspace in one of the two drives\n\n258\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.290\nin a way differently\nthan we do on the other?\n\n259\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.930\nAnd we hide data in one of the two drives,\nbut it's not present in the other drive.\n\n260\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.895\nBecause it's just not going to be there,\n\n261\n00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:54.207\nbecause we only write it\nto one of the two drives.\n\n262\n00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:57.884\nIn other words, can we go around the\nmirror to be able to manipulate the drive\n\n263\n00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:01.290\nat a different level, hiding data in one,\nnot hiding it in the other?\n\n264\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.100\nThe answer is, of course we can, right?\n\n265\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.670\nAnd as a result of that, if we're not\naware of this as a CHFI, if we don't\n\n266\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.820\nforensically examine both drives,\nwe're probably gonna miss the evidence.\n\n267\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.610\nOr, at least in theory,\nwe may not find it,\n\n268\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.060\ndepending on,\nwe have a 50-50 chance, in theory.\n\n269\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.470\nWhich drive we actually investigate.\n\n270\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.100\nSo it's important for us to know that if\nthere's more than one physical drive,\n\n271\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.840\nwe gotta copy everything on every drive.\n\n272\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.900\nCuz we just don't know what\nthe state of those drives are,\n\n273\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.720\nwe have to figure that out after the fact.\n\n274\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.680\nWe have to examine the system,\ntake a look and\n\n275\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.150\nsee whether there is\nevidence of a RAID solution.\n\n276\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.090\nIf there is,\nnote that as part of our documentation.\n\n277\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.520\nAnd then take steps to ensure that we\ncan examine the drives accordingly.\n\n278\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.620\nSo it's gonna be very important for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n279\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.980\nSo just something to think about.\n\n280\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.027\nIt's gonna become even more important when\nwe talk about our next version of RAID,\n\n281\n00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:49.120\nwhich is RAID 5.\n\n282\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.670\nOur striped set, but\nour striped set with parity.\n\n283\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.363\nSo striped set, RAID 0,\nas we've said, two or\n\n284\n00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:59.532\nmore physical drives writing data in\n64 kb stripes across the drive set.\n\n285\n00:12:59.532 --> 00:13:03.620\nIf we lose one of the physical members of\nthe drive set, we lose all of the data.\n\n286\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.370\nThat's an issue for us.\n\n287\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.720\nGood performance, but\nlousy recoverability.\n\n288\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.350\nNot so good, because theoretically,\nand in all actuality,\n\n289\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.750\nthings are built to fail, right?\n\n290\n00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.150\nPlanned obsolescence is, I believe,\nwhat we talk about that as being.\n\n291\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.770\nAnd so,\n\n292\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.370\nas a result, we know that eventually\none of those drives is gonna fail.\n\n293\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.221\nAnd so what we do is, we come up with a\nway to be able to write data to the drive.\n\n294\n00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.788\nBut to do so where we can try to\nsafeguard against that failure,\n\n295\n00:13:27.788 --> 00:13:29.930\nthis is where parity comes in.\n\n296\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.462\nIf we could go to the diagram\nwe have on our screen here.\n\n297\n00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:37.080\nI wanna just walk you through\nthe concept of a RAID 5 solution.\n\n298\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.990\nSo when we think about RAID 5, we are\nthinking about taking a striped set, but\n\n299\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.550\nadding a minimum of\na third drive to the mix.\n\n300\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.795\nSo instead of minimum of two, now we're\nsaying minimum of three physical drives,\n\n301\n00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:49.955\nyou can see them here.\n\n302\n00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:53.300\nAnd we can see that each one is\ngoing to be set up accordingly.\n\n303\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.430\nAnd those three drives are going to\nallow us to create a striped set.\n\n304\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.650\nEach one of the banded areas\nhere is gonna represent data\n\n305\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.760\nin a 64 kb stripe across the stripe set.\n\n306\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.500\nBut what we do with the parity stripe is,\nwe put information from the other\n\n307\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.360\ndrives into a special stripe, and\nwe place it across the drives set.\n\n308\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.620\nSo that way, if one of the drives\nwere to fail, we could reconstitute,\n\n309\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.840\nor essentially recreate the failed drive,\n\n310\n00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.900\nby using the parity information\nfrom all the surviving members.\n\n311\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.800\nAnd so, if we have three drives,\nas we do here, A, B and C left to right,\n\n312\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.440\njust real simple to reference.\n\n313\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.295\nThen we've got a P in one of the stripes\non each of the drives that represents\n\n314\n00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:33.745\nthe parity information, right?\n\n315\n00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.805\nComing from the other two drives.\n\n316\n00:14:35.805 --> 00:14:39.565\nSo if this is drive A,\nthe parity information here\n\n317\n00:14:39.565 --> 00:14:43.435\nis a combination of the information from\ndrive B and drive C, essentially, right?\n\n318\n00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:45.860\nAnd if this is drive B in the middle,\n\n319\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.060\nparity information here would be\na combination of drive A and drive C.\n\n320\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.867\nAnd if this is drive C,\nparity information up at the top there.\n\n321\n00:14:53.867 --> 00:14:56.360\nNo, by the way,\nno significance, no preference\n\n322\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.480\nin terms of order where the parity\nstripe is, that really doesn't matter.\n\n323\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.608\nThis is just a logical representation for\nyou to be able to see it.\n\n324\n00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:05.760\nThis really doesnt equate to what\nit would look like for real.\n\n325\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.209\nIt's not like the parity stripe\non C must be at the top,\n\n326\n00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:09.871\nthat really isn't the way it works.\n\n327\n00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:12.643\nI just want you to be aware of that,\nwe're just diagramming it that way, so\n\n328\n00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.040\nit's easy for you to follow.\n\n329\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.830\nAnd you kinda see the diagonal,\nand watch the parity stripe.\n\n330\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.940\nAnd then on drive C, that parity\nstripe's gonna be constituted, made up,\n\n331\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.170\nfrom the parity information that\nreconstitutes, or allows us, in theory,\n\n332\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.140\nto understand the information\non drives A and B.\n\n333\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.260\nAnd so as we do this, we operate\nthe parity stripe, so RAID 5 is in play.\n\n334\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.607\nOur data is,\nthis is your data file, right?\n\n335\n00:15:34.607 --> 00:15:38.510\nSo we see that kinda stretched\nacross the drives in the stripe.\n\n336\n00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.722\nAnd then what we see is that each drive,\nin theory,\n\n337\n00:15:41.722 --> 00:15:44.428\ndown below, made up of 250 GB of space.\n\n338\n00:15:44.428 --> 00:15:47.416\nAnd what we find is that,\nas a result of this,\n\n339\n00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:52.293\nbecause of the use of the parity stripe,\nwe essentially, effectively,\n\n340\n00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:57.504\nare losing one-third of the maximum\nstorage capacity of the set or the array.\n\n341\n00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:01.784\nIn other words, in theory, if you think\nabout a three-drive set, We essentially,\n\n342\n00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:05.886\nalthough we're using all three drives,\nwhen we add up all the parity stripes from\n\n343\n00:16:05.886 --> 00:16:10.285\nall the drives that are scattered, we have\ntaken one complete drive, 250 gigabytes\n\n344\n00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:14.710\nin this particular example, worth of\nstorage, and dedicated it just to parity.\n\n345\n00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.190\nSo although we have three drives overall\nin the set, our drive size, or rather,\n\n346\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.190\nour set overall capacity, is actually\nequal to two thirds of the maximum.\n\n347\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.880\nSo in this case it would be 250 plus\n250 or 500 gigs of usable space,\n\n348\n00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.390\n750 gigs of total space, but\n250 gigs given over the parity strike.\n\n349\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.235\nSo we could take this out to maximum of\n32 drives as well, software based again,\n\n350\n00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:39.470\nhardware will vary little bit\ndepending on how we set this up.\n\n351\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.000\nBut ultimately we're gonna\nlose a certain number,\n\n352\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.130\na certain amount of storage\nagainst the parity stripes.\n\n353\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.510\nOne of the downsides of using RAID 5, but\n\n354\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.450\nthe upside is if one of\nthese drives were to fail.\n\n355\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.890\nIf we would delete the middle drive,\n\n356\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.540\nyour drive b, parity stripe on drive a,\nparity stripe on drive c.\n\n357\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.280\nBoth of them have pieces\nof drive b's information.\n\n358\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.510\nCombined them together.\n\n359\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.400\nPut a new physical drive\nin to reconstitute against.\n\n360\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.233\nWe'll be able to reconstitute\nthe parity information and\n\n361\n00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:09.430\nessentially repurpose that new drive.\n\n362\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.872\nMake it part of the set and\nreanimate, so to speak, our data.\n\n363\n00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:15.500\nSo, it's just interesting\nthat this is what we can do.\n\n364\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.380\nNow we were gonna build a RAID5 solution.\n\n365\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.940\nWe would have to have\nat least three drives.\n\n366\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.690\nAnd so we would have the drives in, right?\n\n367\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.260\nAnd we would make them available.\n\n368\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.880\nAgain, software or hardware based,\ndoesn't really matter how we do this.\n\n369\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.630\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n370\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.730\nBut as a CHFI, we do wanna understand\n\n371\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.080\nthat we should be aware of the fact that\nthis can be a software based solution.\n\n372\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.150\nDone within an operating system on\na single physical machine or done against\n\n373\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.270\na hardware based array in a storage\nsolution somewhere out on the network or\n\n374\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.700\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n375\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.010\nAnd we would then have\nto operate accordingly.\n\n376\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.770\nRight.\nSo just be aware of that and\n\n377\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.110\nthink about the logic of\nthat as we talk about RAID.\n\n378\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.000\nWe also have RAID Plus or rather RAID 10.\n\n379\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.010\nRAID 1+0, RAID Mirror plus a stripe set,\nessentially the values of both.\n\n380\n00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.650\nWe bring the stripe set together because\nit's very quick, a good access to data,\n\n381\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:04.985\nit's very very fast.\n\n382\n00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.430\nRAID10 because we get the mirror and\n\n383\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.680\nthe fall tolerance capabilities\nas we spoke about.\n\n384\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.730\nSo when we do a RAID10,\n\n385\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.210\nwe combine the concept of the stripe\nset with the concept of the mirror.\n\n386\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.700\nAnd if we did that we would have\nan ability to have at least two,\n\n387\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.770\nperhaps more that two drives\navailable in the the stripe set but\n\n388\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.070\nwe would mirror the drive right,\nthe drive set.\n\n389\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.460\nAnd as a result we would use two\ndrives to create the RAID10 array.\n\n390\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.390\nSo we would essentiality have the same\nkind of solution that we had shown\n\n391\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.300\nyou that Daniel set up for\nus with the physical drives earlier.\n\n392\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.580\nWe would add all those together.\n\n393\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.120\nRemember that when we are forensically\nexamining a machine or\n\n394\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.110\na group of machines,\ndepending on what we are doing.\n\n395\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.680\nWe will often take the physical\ndrive out of the system and\n\n396\n00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.970\nimage it separately using\na drive duplicator, right.\n\n397\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.240\nSo when we do this, we have to keep track\nof which drive was in which position.\n\n398\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.270\nWe have to know which\ndrive was the first drive.\n\n399\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.240\nWhich drive was the second drive,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n400\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.810\nWe're gonna have to make some notes\non some of this stuff, right.\n\n401\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.970\nAnd we may have to look at,\n\n402\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.965\nalthough it's rare these days that you\nhave to worry about jumper settings.\n\n403\n00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:09.375\nBut in an older system we may have to\nlook at whether a drive was a primary,\n\n404\n00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:11.320\nwas a master, or a slave.\n\n405\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.960\nWe have to look at which drive it was and\nthe bays as we open up the system.\n\n406\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.946\nTake the drive out, was this drive zero,\ndrive one, drive two,\n\n407\n00:19:17.946 --> 00:19:19.155\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n408\n00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:22.060\nSo we're going to have to\nkeep track of all this.\n\n409\n00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.110\nKeep in mind, and we've talked about this\nbefore, the value of photographic, right?\n\n410\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.470\nWhere the drives were.\n\n411\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.790\nUnderstanding what order\nthey were found in.\n\n412\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.170\nHow they were cabled up.\n\n413\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.420\nAll of that has to be part of what we do.\n\n414\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.420\nIt's very, very important for us.\n\n415\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.250\nIt's almost literally like going back into\nour a plus thought process about opening\n\n416\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.790\nup a machine, looking at all of\nthe systems in there, all the hardware,\n\n417\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.200\nthe cabling, and everything like that,\n\n418\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.830\nseeing where everything is,\ndiagramming that all, and laying it out.\n\n419\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.320\nI've seen certainly photographs\nare very important and\n\n420\n00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.470\nwe need those to contextually\nlay out the evidence.\n\n421\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.390\nBut I've also seen layout forms,\ntemplates if you like, paper templates\n\n422\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.870\nwhere people will actually diagram and\nsketch out on there okay, these, its\n\n423\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.260\nkind of like got the bay in there, it has\nthe slots for the hard drives whatever.\n\n424\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.050\nAnd they'll diagram out what they found,\n\n425\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.000\nthey'll correspond that with the\nphotograph and I'll actually have both.\n\n426\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.483\nSo assume it's done different ways.\n\n427\n00:20:13.483 --> 00:20:15.580\nIt just depends on, what you're doing and\n\n428\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.190\nkind of the thought process behind it, but\ndon't underestimate the need to do this.\n\n429\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.830\nIt's the things that we talk about,\n\n430\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.140\nthe common sense things like, before\nI open that up, let me take a photo,\n\n431\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.910\nbefore I take it out rather let me take\na photograph so I understand what's there.\n\n432\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.920\nAnd remember a lot of times\nhard drives are slotted in.\n\n433\n00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.400\nCan we go to the overhead for\njust a second?\n\n434\n00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.630\nIn a lot of machines, right?\n\n435\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.710\nHard drives are slotted in.\n\n436\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.730\nThere we go,\ngonna stand that up like that.\n\n437\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.085\nHard drives are, that was stupid.\n\n438\n00:20:45.085 --> 00:20:47.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can't see exactly what I'm trying\n\n439\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.410\nto show you on this one.\n\n440\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.310\nThis one actually, it has a doughnut, it's\nthere just couldn't see it, okay, yeah,\n\n441\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.950\nthat's what I was looking for\nI was wondering why.\n\n442\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.570\nIt looked dark and\nthere was nothing there but\n\n443\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.450\nagain I realized,\nwait a second there is something there.\n\n444\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.550\nBut it just was not easy to see.\n\n445\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.600\nAll right, there we go, so\nwhat I just wanted to show you, on the top\n\n446\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.505\nthat here we got our power connector,\nwe've got a different kind of connection,\n\n447\n00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:13.090\nthis is IDE over here with our power or\njumper settings.\n\n448\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.930\nHere we've got a different\nkind of connection, right?\n\n449\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.360\nLooks different, is different.\n\n450\n00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.340\nAnd we've got our power\nconnection over here.\n\n451\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.110\nSo, a lot of times when this\nis plugged into the machine or\n\n452\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.830\nis mounted,\nit's going to be mounted this way,\n\n453\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:29.040\nwith the connections back here in the back\nof the mounting bay or the bracket.\n\n454\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.650\nThe front of the drive, right,\nmay not actually be, or\n\n455\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.200\nrather the back of the drive\nmay not be what you see.\n\n456\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.890\nSometimes it's cabled this way,\n\n457\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.790\nwhere the back of the drive\nfaces the back of the machine.\n\n458\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.430\nIt depends, but if you're looking at the\nfront of the drive without the connectors,\n\n459\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.070\nyou have to actually open up both sides of\nthe computer or find a way to be able to\n\n460\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.270\nexpose the cables and\nthe ribbons to be able to take a picture.\n\n461\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.413\nMay not be so easy, right?\n\n462\n00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:54.054\nIf you think about some of the cases and\nthe construction mechanism that are used,\n\n463\n00:21:54.054 --> 00:21:55.810\nkinda how these things are set up.\n\n464\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.310\nIt's not always easy, sometimes you\ngonna pull the hard drive out and\n\n465\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.600\nkinda let it hang so\nyou can actually see it.\n\n466\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.880\nIt depends on a variety of circumstances.\n\n467\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.190\nSome of these are servers that\nare rack mount, things like that.\n\n468\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.882\nThey pop up from the top, it's real easy\nto see everything's right there, but some\n\n469\n00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:15.480\nof these old desktops are really, really\nkind of convoluted and crazy to work on.\n\n470\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.100\nSo you just gotta remember that,\nkeep that in mind and\n\n471\n00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.140\nkind of be aware of that as\nwe talk about those things.\n\n472\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.910\n&gt;&gt; Definitely interesting stuff\nthat we gotta keep in mind.\n\n473\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.550\nRAID is something that you're typically\ngonna find in any kind of corporate\n\n474\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.810\nenvironment, because why?\n\n475\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.780\nWell, they wanna make sure\nthey've got redundancy, right?\n\n476\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.610\nThey wanna make sure that if something\nfails, they have sort of backup.\n\n477\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.460\nIt's a nice way to do that, not that\nthey're not taking backups as well.\n\n478\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.750\nBut they can loose a drive,\n\n479\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.390\nslap another drive in and\nthey don't really have any down time.\n\n480\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.380\nSo you see RAID a lot.\n\n481\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.920\nAnd understanding how each one of\nthe RAID arrays work can remind you,\n\n482\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.090\nwell you know what?\n\n483\n00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.790\nI think we took this away from about the\nmiddle of the show, is I could be hiding,\n\n484\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.440\nif I've got a two disk set up and\nsome sort of a mirror or\n\n485\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.500\na stripe, I could be hiding information\non one disk and not the other, but\n\n486\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.190\ntend to think of it collectively\nas just one piece of information.\n\n487\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.270\nRemember, two drives equals two pieces\nof information even though they might be\n\n488\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.680\na part of the same information set.\n\n489\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.480\n&gt;&gt; There's two locations.\n\n490\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's two locations, and we've\ngot to duplicate both of those drives.\n\n491\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.580\nWe've gotta verify those drives don't\nhave anything on them that we need\n\n492\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.870\nforensically, right?\n\n493\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.060\nSo, to help our case or\nfurther our case along.\n\n494\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.570\nAdam, thank you for pointing that out\nto us because that's an easy point for\n\n495\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.560\nus to overlook,\nis to think of it as just one giant entity\n\n496\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.600\ninstead of multiple locations\nwith its own set of data.\n\n497\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.720\nThat being said, I think,\n\n498\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.620\ndo we have anything else that we need\nto talk about when it comes to RAID?\n\n499\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.409\n&gt;&gt; Not for this particular one,\nno we don't.\n\n500\n00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:34.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n501\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.370\n&gt;&gt; I could make something up, but\n\n502\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.025\nI don't really know if that would\nbe of any value to anybody.\n\n503\n00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:40.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, we do appreciate the values that\n\n504\n00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.430\nyou have given us for today.\n\n505\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.670\nBut it looks like it's\nthe end of our show.\n\n506\n00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.190\nSo, thanks for watching everyone.\n\n507\n00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.450\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n508\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm a stripe set with\na mirrored duplex controller, And\n\n509\n00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.030\nI'm gonna be available in case\nsomething fails, you can always ask me.\n\n510\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.240\n&gt;&gt; It rolls right off the tongue,\ndoesn't it?\n\n511\n00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.481\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n512\n00:23:56.481 --> 00:24:03.520\n[MUSIC]\n\n513\n00:24:03.520 -->

00:00:10.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.070\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.670\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.200\nwe're continuing on with\nmore in our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.989\nJoining us back again for some dabbling in\nthe Windows world, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.040\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020\nAdam, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, it is going well.\n\n12\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.140\nThank you for your extended\ninvitation to join you here today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.740\nWe're gonna continue our conversation.\n\n14\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.400\nIt's gonna actually subtitle this\nset of episodes, the command line,\n\n15\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.560\nbecause we're gonna spend a fair\namount of time in Windows.\n\n16\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.390\nTaking a look at a very interesting topic,\na topic that we will refer to as, and\n\n17\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.240\nI think we have referred to,\nas Windows forensics.\n\n18\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.770\nBut the reality is, in the Windows world,\n\n19\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.200\nthe way in which we engage in a lot of the\nactivities that we've been talking about,\n\n20\n00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.430\nhow do we grab data,\nhow do we interact with it?\n\n21\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.250\nHow do we see it,\nfrom the volatility perspective,\n\n22\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.580\nin terms of order of volatility,\nwhat's in memory, what's in the registers,\n\n23\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.705\nwhat's in the caches, things like that.\n\n24\n00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.620\nWhere to start drilling through and\ntaking a look at some of the mechanisms,\n\n25\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.020\nmethodologies, and\ntools associated with that behavior.\n\n26\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.360\nAnd we're gonna do so\nby talking through demos as we go,\n\n27\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.360\nshowing you some stuff in the graphical\ninterface, as well as the command line.\n\n28\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.790\nGot some interesting tools that you\ncan download and use, and in general,\n\n29\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.565\njust some ideas we're gonna\nshare with you along the way.\n\n30\n00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.370\nSo we talked about volatile\ninformation before,\n\n31\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.054\ntalked about the concept of\nthe order of volatility of evidence.\n\n32\n00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:39.804\nAnd we've spoken about the fact that\nthere is certain kinds of evidence in\n\n33\n00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:44.330\na forensic examination that we\nhave to go after immediately.\n\n34\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.842\nWhen we find the machine, we've been asked\nto investigate it, and we take a look at\n\n35\n00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.822\nit and it's running, there's a lot\nof stuff going on under the hood.\n\n36\n00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:55.351\nAnd we have to start really thinking about\nfrom a forensics examiner, forensics\n\n37\n00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:59.678\ninvestigator perspective, what is it that\nwe have to do, and how do we have to\n\n38\n00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:04.161\napproach doing that in order to maximize\nour ability to be able to capture data.\n\n39\n00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.202\nSo for instance, I'll just go to\nthe desktop here for just one second,\n\n40\n00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:07.770\nif we could.\n\n41\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.695\nSo we have a typical desktop running,\nthat is a bright shiny blue, is it not?\n\n42\n00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:13.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it is.\n&gt;&gt; That almost hurts the eyes to look at\n\n43\n00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.880\nthat, that's how bright it is.\n\n44\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.200\nAnd that's with the glare screen up.\n\n45\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.437\nImagine how bright it is without\nthe glare screen going on.\n\n46\n00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:24.257\nAll right, so on the desktop there, we\nhave just a whole bunch of programs that\n\n47\n00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:27.990\nyou can see in the task bar\nthat are opened up and running.\n\n48\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.200\nI'm gonna be talking through and\nusing a lot of these.\n\n49\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.160\nSo you could see we have\na whole bunch of stuff there,\n\n50\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.700\ngot several different command lines open,\ngot a bunch of web sessions open,\n\n51\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.815\ngot a couple of notepad items,\nbunch of Windows explorer items.\n\n52\n00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:43.870\nI've got a red janitor open,\ngot a bunch of stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.830\nSo there's a whole lot of programs,\nwhole lot of data,\n\n54\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.810\nwhole lot of processes that are moving\nthrough this system simultaneously.\n\n55\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.749\nAnd while we certainly\nwanna be aware of them,\n\n56\n00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.497\nwe may not really be able to\nunderstand all of them on the surface.\n\n57\n00:02:57.497 --> 00:03:00.587\nWe may not be able to understand\nwhat's happening with all of them, and\n\n58\n00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:02.920\nwe probably don't have\nvisibility into all of them.\n\n59\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.937\nAnd this is one of the things\nthat as a forensic investigator,\n\n60\n00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:09.197\nwe have to step back and\nactually ponder, as we're taking a look.\n\n61\n00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:12.636\nBecause we don't really have a good\nway of going into that system, and\n\n62\n00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:15.600\non the surface,\nseeing everything that's there.\n\n63\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.590\nSome people say, well,\nwhat about if we launched Task Manager or\n\n64\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.350\nsomething like that?\n\n65\n00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.791\nWell, no problem, we can do that,\n\n66\n00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:22.822\nbut there are certain\ntasks we're not gonna see.\n\n67\n00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:26.798\nThere are certain processes that are not\nexposed to the graphical interface, and we\n\n68\n00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:30.670\nmay not be aware of those unless we have\nknowledge of them and know they're there.\n\n69\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.400\nSo this is something we have to consider.\n\n70\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.790\nSo, we can go back cuz we wanna spend some\ntime taking a look at what's going on.\n\n71\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.600\nLet's start with some of the basics.\n\n72\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.820\nLet me actually show you this\nlittle piece In Windows 10.\n\n73\n00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.692\nLet's just jump out of the actual demo\nenvironment into a secondary environment,\n\n74\n00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.690\nbut one that's equally important.\n\n75\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.170\nI'm on a Windows 10 box running\nunderneath our virtual environment.\n\n76\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.940\nSo we're gonna just take a look at\na couple of different ways to do this in\n\n77\n00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.870\nWindows 10, right?\n\n78\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.317\nWhen we think about wanting to do\nsomething we can come in here,\n\n79\n00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:59.540\nright click, open up a command prompt.\n\n80\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.580\nLet's just go do that.\n\n81\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.970\nFrom the admin, we're just gonna\nspecify our password there.\n\n82\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.702\nThank you, Mr Nate.\n\n83\n00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:10.480\nAnd we're gonna have such a dark\nbackground that we can't see anything.\n\n84\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.533\nSo we're gonna change that\nbackground really quickly,\n\n85\n00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:14.293\njust to make it a little bit easier for\nyou to see.\n\n86\n00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:17.660\nI forgot to do that while\nwe were getting started.\n\n87\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.910\nLet me do a console item there, and\nlet's just do a little color change.\n\n88\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.210\nWhat are you feeling like today,\na little blue on white, white on blue?\n\n89\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, white on blue,\nlet's go backwards.\n\n90\n00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:29.865\n&gt;&gt; A little background with white,\na little text for blue.\n\n91\n00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:33.165\nAll right, so we'll do that, and it should\nbe a little bit easier to see that,\n\n92\n00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:36.020\nprobably a lot easier for\nyou to tell what's going on there.\n\n93\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.850\nSo if we wanna go in and\ntake a look at something here,\n\n94\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.910\nright, something as simple as what is\ntoday's date and, or the time, right?\n\n95\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.920\nWe can just do something\nas simple as that.\n\n96\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.270\nIf we wanna do time, we can simply go\nin and issue a date and time command.\n\n97\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.236\nNow, this may seem a little simplistic,\na little basic, right?\n\n98\n00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:56.863\nWe don't need to obviously really do\nmuch to think through the logic of\n\n99\n00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:00.245\nunderstanding that, but\nhow important would it be to understand\n\n100\n00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.639\nwhat the date and time is in\nthe system as we begin to investigate?\n\n101\n00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.500\nIt'd be very, very important.\n\n102\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.409\nIf we're not familiar with that, what\nif there's a time offset on the system?\n\n103\n00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.995\nWhat if it's set up to use UTC, and\nit's coordinated against a time server and\n\n104\n00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:16.040\nit's become decoupled or desynchronized?\n\n105\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.750\nThat can be a problem, and\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n106\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.550\nWe could obviously, in theory, could you\ngo to full screen for me for a second?\n\n107\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.540\nWe could obviously come down\nhere to the clock, right?\n\n108\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.480\nAnd double click or\nclick on that and bring that up, but\n\n109\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.450\nwe could see the date and\ntime or whatever it is.\n\n110\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.420\nBut keep in mind, right, we wanna really\nminimize the amount of stuff we're doing\n\n111\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.360\nin the interface if at all possible.\n\n112\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.440\nAnd there's no way to guarantee and\nto know that\n\n113\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.900\nclicking on that clock interface will or\nwill not modify something in the system.\n\n114\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.090\nThere's no way to guarantee and know for\n\n115\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.700\nsure that opening command\nprompt will not either.\n\n116\n00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.100\nSo you just have to be aware of that.\n\n117\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.010\nBut the reality is, using a command\nprompt is typically gonna be a fairly\n\n118\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.340\nbasic file process that as an investigator\nwe use for system commands like this,\n\n119\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.070\nit's innocuous, it's not gonna\nmodify anything in and of itself.\n\n120\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.930\nBut we do wanna be aware of the fact\nthat we should look to capture\n\n121\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.400\nthat kind of information,\nand that's in Windows 10.\n\n122\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.450\nIf we go back to a Server 2008\nenvironment while we're demoing in,\n\n123\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.910\nand we open up a command prompt here,\nand we issue the same date.\n\n124\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.300\nAnd the same time command,\nwe will see that it behaves the same way,\n\n125\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.000\nthere really is no difference.\n\n126\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.950\nAnd so we do wanna just be aware of the\nfact that we can use these kinds of basic\n\n127\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.510\ncommands across the system to look for\nvolatile information.\n\n128\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.762\nAnd something as basic as date and time is\ngonna be really important for us, right,\n\n129\n00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:41.410\nand really important for us to\nunderstand when I wanna understand basic\n\n130\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.567\ncommands from the Windows command line.\n\n131\n00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:46.439\nNow we could do the equivalent\nof this in Linux, by the way,\n\n132\n00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.730\nby issuing a command for help in the Linux\ninterface, in the shell when we log on.\n\n133\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.840\nAnd we could read the man pages or\nthe help pages, right, for basic help.\n\n134\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.150\nBut if we do this just by issuing a help\ncommand at the command prompt, and\n\n135\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.050\nwe obviously don't wanna do this\non the system we're investigating,\n\n136\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.120\njust to be clear.\n\n137\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.860\nBut we would do this prior to\nmoving into that system, so\n\n138\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.240\nthat we can look at all this information\nwithout potentially, in any way,\n\n139\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.598\ncompromising the integrity of\nthe data that is in the system.\n\n140\n00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:15.600\nBut we'd wanna look at the basic help\nfiles and understand what's there.\n\n141\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.180\nAll I did was just use the date command,\nwhich is right here,\n\n142\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.660\nright, and use the time command, which\nis a little bit further down right here,\n\n143\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.700\nright, to be able to pull some basic\ninformation out of the system.\n\n144\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.081\nKnowing that those commands are available,\nand\n\n145\n00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:34.678\nknowing that we can use them is part of\nwhat we expect a CHFI to be able to do,\n\n146\n00:07:34.678 --> 00:07:38.218\npart of the expectation for the knowledge\nthat we would want you to have,\n\n147\n00:07:38.218 --> 00:07:42.073\nbring to the investigation, and also\nhave if you're preparing for the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:42.073 --> 00:07:45.679\nIt would be, as I said, a good idea for\nyou to do this on a system that is\n\n149\n00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:49.930\nnot being investigated separately,\nwe're doing it in a virtual environment.\n\n150\n00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.939\nYou can easily do it on\nany machine that you have,\n\n151\n00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.461\nwhether it's physical or virtual.\n\n152\n00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:56.166\nYou saw me do this on a Windows\n10 machine that's physical, and\n\n153\n00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:58.542\nyou saw me do it in a virtual\nenvironment at the same time.\n\n154\n00:07:58.542 --> 00:07:59.972\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n155\n00:07:59.972 --> 00:08:04.174\nI would suggest that if you're gonna ever\nhave to investigate older Windows systems,\n\n156\n00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:05.800\nyou look at the help file on them.\n\n157\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.960\nThere may be slight variations, although\nall the commands that are shown here\n\n158\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.760\nare gonna be supported without exception\nacross multiple versions of Windows.\n\n159\n00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.690\nBut will they differ\na little bit in Linux?\n\n160\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.170\nAbsolutely, there's definitely some\ndifferences there we'd wanna be aware of.\n\n161\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.550\nWill they differ in Unix?\n\n162\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.660\nMost likely differ a little\nbit there as well.\n\n163\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.878\nAnd we'd want to be aware of that.\n\n164\n00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:27.230\nSo we'd wanna do a little investigative\nbackground work, right, a little homework\n\n165\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.730\nto understand the logic of that, and\nto make sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n166\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.209\nIf we're not familiar with the commands,\n\n167\n00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:33.778\nwe should play around\nwith them a little bit.\n\n168\n00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:38.351\nCan we go back here, cuz we wanna\ntake a look at something else.\n\n169\n00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.831\nSo if we have our help file and\n\n170\n00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:44.270\nlet's say we don't understand necessarily\nhow a tool or a command is gonna work.\n\n171\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.610\nLet's say for\ninstance the tree command, right.\n\n172\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.100\nInstead of just firing it off just use\nthe forward slash question mark to read\n\n173\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.020\nthe help follower get whatever\njust any help available.\n\n174\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.620\nI've talked about this in some of\nthe other demonstrations we've done.\n\n175\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.660\nAlways try to remind you how to look for\n\n176\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.340\nhelp on a tool before we use it to\nmake sure you're comfortable with it.\n\n177\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.620\nNot necessarily because tree\nis a complicated command\n\n178\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.290\nyou could see it's\npretty straight forward.\n\n179\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.160\nBut because it's important for\nyou to know how to use the command and\n\n180\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.380\nunderstand the logic of it.\n\n181\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.450\nSo I wanna make sure we're familiar\nwith that, and we have a sense of that.\n\n182\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.540\nLet's take a look at, for instance, how\nwe could go in query for logged on users.\n\n183\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.370\nA lot of times, we wanna be able to\nsee if anybody's logged into a system\n\n184\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.790\nas we're forensically examining it.\n\n185\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.310\nA lot of times,\npeople may be logged in remotely.\n\n186\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.030\nThis is something that may be taking place\nin real time while we're on the system.\n\n187\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.410\nWe'd wanna be aware of that.\n\n188\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.540\nThere are a lot of ways for\nus to check this, but\n\n189\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.370\nthere are tools that will allow\nus to do this, fairly easily.\n\n190\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.960\nSo, let's take a look at\na couple of the tools.\n\n191\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.820\nOne of them would be something that's\nbuilt right into Windows, called,\n\n192\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.770\nNetSession.\n\n193\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.870\nWe can actually the NetSession command,\nthe net command.\n\n194\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.060\nThere's a variety of different\ncommands that go with net.\n\n195\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.470\nBut, NetSession will allow me to\nsee if there's any remote usage.\n\n196\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.970\nAnd you could see that I actually\ndo have a remote connection.\n\n197\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.780\nIt's actually me logged\nin through a share around\n\n198\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.120\nthe back end kind of just to show you\nthat there would be something on this.\n\n199\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.010\nBut you could see that somebody's\nlogged in to this machine,\n\n200\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.410\nyou could see the IPv6 address.\n\n201\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.380\nAs you could see, you could see the\nusername in this case cuz it's local so\n\n202\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.260\nI know that.\n\n203\n00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.250\nWe could see the open, over here,\nthe open title time meeting.\n\n204\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.810\nHow long have we been on?\n\n205\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.630\nWe've been on for about 12 minutes\napproximately at the point at which I\n\n206\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.110\nqueried to see this connection.\n\n207\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.050\nSo we can get some basic\ninformation to understand this.\n\n208\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.370\nNow, could we look at\nanother way of getting this?\n\n209\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.790\nAbsolutely, can look at another\ncommand that does the same thing.\n\n210\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.483\nLet's do logonsessions.\n\n211\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.300\nAnd if we do logonsessions,\nanother command built right into Windows.\n\n212\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.980\nSo in the Windows operating system itself,\n\n213\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.020\nwe can take a look right here at,\nor excuse me,\n\n214\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.500\nnot built right into Windows but rather\npart of the system internals tool set.\n\n215\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.310\nI'm running it from within\nsystem internals tools,\n\n216\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.560\nwhat I meant to say, inside of\nthe tool set that we've talked about.\n\n217\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.030\nWhen we do,\nyou'll see that with log on sessions\n\n218\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.630\nI get a little bit more\ndetailed information.\n\n219\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.380\nThat first one with the netsession\ncommand, kinda skimpy, right.\n\n220\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.360\nFound out we had a user remotely logged\nin, in theory found a user name,\n\n221\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.640\nfound the ip they were coming from and\nperhaps how long they'd been logged in.\n\n222\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.650\nBut not quite a lot of information.\n\n223\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.240\nHere I could see a little bit more.\n\n224\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.940\nI could see work group and\nthe machine name, so\n\n225\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.340\nthe user name is there,\nauthentication type and TLM.\n\n226\n00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.170\nAll that's gonna become important later.\n\n227\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.980\nSession, session ID, log-on time,\nnow, if I had additional information,\n\n228\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.390\nif I was in a domain,\ngoing through a directory service,\n\n229\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.430\nI would see additional information for\nlogon server.\n\n230\n00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.910\nAnd I would be able to tell\nmore information about it.\n\n231\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.250\nBut I can also see that I\nhave service accounts here.\n\n232\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.180\nI user account for\nweb access is being used.\n\n233\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.500\nI have the administrator account\nbeing used interactively,\n\n234\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.780\nthat's my active logon session.\n\n235\n00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.800\nAnd I have several of them that\nare being referenced here right.\n\n236\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.450\nAnd I can see that there's\na lot of different ones,\n\n237\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.910\nthere's my local service one, there's my.\n\n238\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Adam is this showing people\nthat are currently logged in or\n\n239\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.370\npeople that have been logged in?\n\n240\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.120\n&gt;&gt; Currently logged in.\n\n241\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.260\n&gt;&gt; So its only that?\n\n242\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.620\n&gt;&gt; Currently logged in and\n\n243\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.750\nconnected to the machine remotely\nat the time that I'm querying.\n\n244\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.120\nNow these are all service accounts,\n\n245\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.270\nthey're being used actively during\nthe time that the system is in process.\n\n246\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.560\nSo any of these,\nlike iUser account for instance,\n\n247\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.610\nthe web proxy account that's used to go\nout in Windows and access web services,\n\n248\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.260\nis being used because they have Google,\nI have the Chrome browser open.\n\n249\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.340\nSo we're using that to\nspawn the web sessions.\n\n250\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.850\nSo I get a complete listing with this\ntool of all interactive logons and\n\n251\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.480\nremote logons that are taking\nplace on the machine.\n\n252\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.410\nNow I did that, if I do this and\n\n253\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.690\nadd a p switch to this,\nI will get additional information.\n\n254\n00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.020\nI get the ports and\n\n255\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.160\nthe executables that are calling\nthose ports for every user session.\n\n256\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.080\n&gt;&gt; That could be handy.\n\n257\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.600\n&gt;&gt; That could be very handy.\n\n258\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.430\nSo being able to read the help\nfile on these tools and\n\n259\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.810\nlearning about certain switches\ngives me a lot of information.\n\n260\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.890\nBecause unless you knew that\nthis tool existed, number one.\n\n261\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.630\nAnd unless you knew that it had a switch\nthat would allow me to see the ports,\n\n262\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.810\nI may not fully capture that information.\n\n263\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.933\nNow can I find the port information\nby using a tool like Nbtstat or\n\n264\n00:13:01.933 --> 00:13:06.685\nnetstat, or a variety of different tools\nthat will give me port capabilities and\n\n265\n00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.135\nunderstanding what's there?\n\n266\n00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:11.475\nYeah, netstat will give me that\ninformation, there's no doubt about it.\n\n267\n00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:13.878\nBut would it attributed to\nan individual user session?\n\n268\n00:13:13.878 --> 00:13:18.846\nIt would be hard to attribute\nit to who's using it because\n\n269\n00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:21.544\nif we take a look, at netstat.\n\n270\n00:13:23.984 --> 00:13:27.136\nAnd I do netstat minus a for\nthe adapter and\n\n271\n00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:32.461\nI take a look I will see port information\nI will see both for TCP and UDP.\n\n272\n00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:36.262\nI will see the address, I see the active\nconnections on the ports, but\n\n273\n00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:37.950\ndo I see the executables?\n\n274\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.110\nAnd do I see it attributed\nto each user account?\n\n275\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.750\nNo, I just essentially see hey,\nthere's a connection.\n\n276\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.780\nSo I get some information but\nI don't get the same information\n\n277\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.816\nas what I get up here looking at\nthis individual account saying,\n\n278\n00:13:49.816 --> 00:13:54.508\nokay SA dollar sign, whatever this is,\nthe service account in this case, right.\n\n279\n00:13:54.508 --> 00:13:57.476\nAnd you could see it's using these\nparticular sessions cuz this is the,\n\n280\n00:13:57.476 --> 00:14:00.165\none of the Windows service\naccounts that's actually spawning.\n\n281\n00:14:00.165 --> 00:14:04.637\nI mean look at SVC host, right, that's\ngonna be our underlying service account\n\n282\n00:14:04.637 --> 00:14:06.830\nthat spawns our Windows connections.\n\n283\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.653\nAnd our MSDTC, our data connection,\nwe could see here,\n\n284\n00:14:10.653 --> 00:14:14.870\nwe've got our let's see\nlocal service being spawned.\n\n285\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.870\nThis is the one I'm looking for\nright here.\n\n286\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.780\nThis is me logged on interactively,\nthis is my account.\n\n287\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.460\nAnd you could see all the stuff running\nunder my account right here, all right.\n\n288\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.120\nThis will be incredibly\nimportant information for\n\n289\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.840\nme to have out of the volatile\ndata that's stored in the system.\n\n290\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.360\nWhen I turn the system off\nall that data's going away.\n\n291\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.770\nI'm not gonna have any idea,\nas a forensic investigator, what programs,\n\n292\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.120\nwhat ports, and\nwhat users were using them were\n\n293\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.650\nactually active on the system\nat the time that I'm doing this.\n\n294\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.600\nThis is the only way to capture\nthis information in real time.\n\n295\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.230\nIf I do a drive copy which I will do\nat some point, of this system and\n\n296\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.030\ncreate an image,\n\n297\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.990\nI'm not gonna to capture all that because\nit's not gonna be part of what I capture.\n\n298\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.950\nIt's not gonna be part of the memory,\nthat's in the system.\n\n299\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.830\nThis is all in volatile storage, this is\nall in the RAM or in one of the registers,\n\n300\n00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.090\nor potentially somewhere else.\n\n301\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Adam do we need to worry about if\nwe were the forensics investigator on\n\n302\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.910\nthe scene, maybe a first responder or\nsomething.\n\n303\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.510\nWe're trying to gather the information\nquickly, or even securely,\n\n304\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.260\ndo we need to worry about running these\ntypes of commands to see who's logged on,\n\n305\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.600\nand may possibly damaging or modifying\n\n306\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.610\nthe system to make it to where we wouldn't\nbe able to use it as admissible evidence?\n\n307\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.830\n&gt;&gt; We definitely have to,\nwe definitely wanna think about that and\n\n308\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.780\nbe aware of that.\n\n309\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.100\nIn other words, we may not want a first\nresponder, we've talked about this before\n\n310\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.090\nto Daniel's point, we may not want a first\nresponder that's not trained to do this.\n\n311\n00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.390\nTo do this because what they may do is run\nthis and go, wow, I gotta capture that.\n\n312\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.880\nAnd they may try to do something that's\ngonna essentially modify, right,\n\n313\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.760\nthat information.\n\n314\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.714\nOr modify the forensic integrity\nof the information in the system.\n\n315\n00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:50.985\nAs opposed to a trained first responder.\n\n316\n00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:54.024\nSo, we would wanna distinguish right,\nbetween hey I just showed up.\n\n317\n00:15:54.024 --> 00:15:55.803\nLet me secure the scene,\ndon't really know what's happening.\n\n318\n00:15:55.803 --> 00:15:56.892\nNot sure what to do, but\n\n319\n00:15:56.892 --> 00:16:00.175\nmake sure nobody does anything till\nthe professionals show up versus.\n\n320\n00:16:00.175 --> 00:16:04.459\nHey, I'm the trained responder\nthat's here, let me get into.\n\n321\n00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:05.863\nRemember the Saturday Night Live skits?\n\n322\n00:16:05.863 --> 00:16:09.199\nYou know, the crazy, stupid IT guy,\nthe pain in the ass guy?\n\n323\n00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:09.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n324\n00:16:09.987 --> 00:16:10.987\n&gt;&gt; Whatever his name was.\n\n325\n00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:12.190\n&gt;&gt; Nick Burns.\n&gt;&gt; Now you're that character, yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.238\nAnd so, hey, get out of the way, right?\n\n327\n00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:16.610\nLet me get at that machine,\nyou know, that kind of thing.\n\n328\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.810\nWe don't want that happening\nunless we're a trained responder.\n\n329\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.130\nAnd we have to distinguish between first\nresponder and trained first responder,\n\n330\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.180\nto answer your question.\n\n331\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.486\nBut we definitely want this\ninformation captured, we want it run.\n\n332\n00:16:28.486 --> 00:16:31.440\nBut we wanna make sure\nthe right person is doing it.\n\n333\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.630\nWe go back here, let's take a look.\n\n334\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.990\nSo if I do something like I just did,\nright, login sessions -p.\n\n335\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.440\nAnd then I output that\ninformation to the C drive.\n\n336\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.195\nI essentially write the output of\nthat with the ports to the C drive.\n\n337\n00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:47.980\nlogons.txt is what we just did.\n\n338\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.650\nIf we go in and\ntake a look in the C drive, right?\n\n339\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.435\nI've got that there.\n\n340\n00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:58.460\nNow if you notice the file date and\ntime, let's just zoom in there.\n\n341\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.440\nFile date and time creation right there.\n\n342\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.629\nI just created that file in real time,\nright?\n\n343\n00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:06.487\nI mean, we were here watching me do this.\n\n344\n00:17:06.487 --> 00:17:10.867\nAnd now the problem becomes that I've\nmodified the data on that hard drive by\n\n345\n00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:12.310\nadding that file.\n\n346\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.190\nIf a first responder did this without\nbeing trained to do this in a way that\n\n347\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.840\nwould not modify the drive, we've\nessentially just lost every opportunity\n\n348\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.820\nto present any information in\nthis drive that may be important.\n\n349\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.550\nBecause we've,\nin the rush to capture this data,\n\n350\n00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.060\nforensically done so\nin a way that is not sound.\n\n351\n00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.810\nWe've modified the drive.\n\n352\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.720\nThe judge will look at this and go,\nwell, you know, hey guys guess what?\n\n353\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.680\nWe don't know what else you\nmay have done to this drive.\n\n354\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.110\nAnything that's found\nthere is now suspect.\n\n355\n00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.264\nEven though you probably didn't do\nanything that would in any way modify this\n\n356\n00:17:43.264 --> 00:17:45.070\ninformation, I can't know that for sure.\n\n357\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.350\nAnd as a result, I can't use any\nof this information in court.\n\n358\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.540\nBecause when we do a time stamp or\na scan of time stamps and access logs.\n\n359\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.071\nAnd we look at this and say, well,\nwhen did you show up on scene?\n\n360\n00:17:57.071 --> 00:17:58.450\nI was there at 2:30.\n\n361\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.040\nWell, how did something\nat 2:33 get created,\n\n362\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.710\nif you in theory had already claimed\nthis machine and locked it down?\n\n363\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.780\nWell, somebody ran it.\n\n364\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.530\nWell, game over essentially,\nright, we're done.\n\n365\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.750\nWe have to do that, but we have to\ndo that in a forensically sound way.\n\n366\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.940\nWrite it out to an external\ndrive with a write blocker,\n\n367\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.590\nas we've talked about,\nthat's not gonna allow write-back.\n\n368\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.290\nSo that that data doesn't show up on\nthe drive, but essentially does show up.\n\n369\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.229\nNow what we get if we capture it,\nright, is we get this perfect file\n\n370\n00:18:26.229 --> 00:18:30.390\nthat has all this great\ninformation in it that shows us.\n\n371\n00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.270\nI'm just zooming in so you can see.\n\n372\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.710\nThat shows us, by session, all the ports\nand all the programs being used.\n\n373\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.905\nAnd who's logon that\nwe're being used under.\n\n374\n00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:44.432\nAnd the logon time when this user or\nthis account went active.\n\n375\n00:18:44.432 --> 00:18:46.531\nAnd unique identifiers about this, so\n\n376\n00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:50.099\nthat we can then cross-reference\nthis information in a logfile.\n\n377\n00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:54.366\nWe can go and kinda literally walk through\nabout ten different other areas of\n\n378\n00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.840\nthe system, gathering data as we go.\n\n379\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.017\nTriangulating and\n\n380\n00:18:58.017 --> 00:19:02.220\ncross-referencing how this information is\ngonna start painting a picture for us.\n\n381\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.680\nThis is not by itself enough evidence for\n\n382\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.040\nus to authoritatively say,\nyeah this user was doing all these things.\n\n383\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.770\nOr this account in this case,\nit's a service account.\n\n384\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.911\nBut what it is authoritative for, right,\n\n385\n00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:15.891\nbecause what we'd actually\nwant is not that user account.\n\n386\n00:19:15.891 --> 00:19:19.660\nWe would actually want this\nuser account right here, right?\n\n387\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.467\nAnd this is the admin account right,\nthis is me logged on.\n\n388\n00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:26.250\nAnd you could see the great list\nof everything I'm doing here.\n\n389\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.139\nBut what we would want,\nis we would want to be able to understand\n\n390\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.070\nall of the information that is here.\n\n391\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.990\nRight, we've got the executables, right?\n\n392\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.346\nWe've got an individual tracking\nunique process ID that's there.\n\n393\n00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:41.750\nWe may have port numbers there.\n\n394\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.140\nThere's a lot of different\nstuff that's gonna go on.\n\n395\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.900\nAnd the reality is we can\ntake that information.\n\n396\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.183\nAnd we can work it backwards, right?\n\n397\n00:19:49.183 --> 00:19:52.510\nAnd we can understand as a result of that,\nas we scroll down,\n\n398\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.419\nwe can understand all this stuff.\n\n399\n00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.910\nSo if we took this for instance, right?\n\n400\n00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:02.860\nAnd we went ahead and we said,\nlet's just go here real quick.\n\n401\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.730\nAnd we just minimize here and\nminimize here.\n\n402\n00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.600\nAnd let's say that we did this.\n\n403\n00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.586\nAnd start Task Manager,\ncuz I'm a smart now.\n\n404\n00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.100\nI know how to look for it, right?\n\n405\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.719\nAnd we go in and\nwe pull up our Task Manager here.\n\n406\n00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.080\nAnd we look at our processes.\n\n407\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.610\nLet me make this full size, so\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n408\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.119\nAnd we explode this out, and\njust kind of bring this over.\n\n409\n00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:30.130\nWhat we're gonna see, so\nyou can see all that,\n\n410\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.830\nin just the traditional\nTask Manager in Windows, right?\n\n411\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.927\nWe're gonna see that we\ncan track these processes.\n\n412\n00:20:38.927 --> 00:20:41.420\nThere is three, or four, or\nfive instances in Chrome.\n\n413\n00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.496\nAnd we could see they're running,\nbut we don't have a process ID.\n\n414\n00:20:44.496 --> 00:20:47.517\nThere's no way for us to know\nwhich process is being linked back\n\n415\n00:20:47.517 --> 00:20:50.766\nto the process ID that's gonna be\nlisted in the capture we just did,\n\n416\n00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:52.960\nreport numbers or anything like that.\n\n417\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.670\nAll we're seeing is basic stuff,\nnow this is Windows 2008.\n\n418\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.152\nIf we did the same thing in Windows 10,\nwe would get a process ID.\n\n419\n00:20:59.152 --> 00:21:03.040\nWe'd be able to see the PID in the Task\nManager, cuz it has more information.\n\n420\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.810\nBut it's not here, right?\n\n421\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.198\nNow we could go in and\nwe can do the following.\n\n422\n00:21:09.198 --> 00:21:12.495\nLet me just do one quick thing.\n\n423\n00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:17.512\nSo make sure that we set up our PID.\n\n424\n00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:20.937\nWe gonna put our PID in there in our\nsession ID's, just to show them to you.\n\n425\n00:21:20.937 --> 00:21:24.578\nAnd so when we had our PID, right,\nright there, just add them in.\n\n426\n00:21:24.578 --> 00:21:27.030\nBecause, by default, natively,\nthey're not shown up.\n\n427\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.040\nYou just have to add them in as a column.\n\n428\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.532\nIf I track over here.\n\n429\n00:21:30.532 --> 00:21:33.381\nAnd I see that the one\nI just highlighted for\n\n430\n00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:37.610\nchrome.exe 2828 is the PID,\nright, the process ID.\n\n431\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.411\nWhen I then go back to my file\njust to reference this, right,\n\n432\n00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.256\nwhat I can see is remember process 2828.\n\n433\n00:21:44.256 --> 00:21:48.436\nWhat I can do is go back here,\npull up my capture.\n\n434\n00:21:48.436 --> 00:21:50.974\nAnd if I zoom in and I come down,\n\n435\n00:21:50.974 --> 00:21:56.170\nwe should see it roughly about halfway or\nso up from the bottom.\n\n436\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.370\nI didn't highlight it, but\nyou could see, 2828 is there.\n\n437\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.900\nThat links the process that was\nrunning under that user account\n\n438\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.000\nat the time that I captured this\nto the process that I see now.\n\n439\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.430\nSo, I could begin to correlate this.\n\n440\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.660\nI could look at log files and\nsay, hey, that's the process ID.\n\n441\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.540\nI could track across,\nI can find this information.\n\n442\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.242\nI could see references to what\nthis user was or was not doing.\n\n443\n00:22:17.242 --> 00:22:20.488\nAnd this is just one way we begin\nthe pull together the story and\n\n444\n00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:21.930\nbring together this data.\n\n445\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.990\nBut by capturing something like this\nwith logged on users unable to see\n\n446\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.390\nthe information in real-time, I'm able\nto correlate that to what's happening.\n\n447\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.490\nAnd this is just one example.\n\n448\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.140\nThis is just how do I see logged on users.\n\n449\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.240\nWhat about open files?\n\n450\n00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.319\nWhat if I wanna look for open files in\nthe system in real-time and see those?\n\n451\n00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:41.800\nWe could do the same thing.\n\n452\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.230\nLet's just clear our screen out here so we\ncan begin from the beginning, as they say.\n\n453\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.600\nInstead of net sessions,\nwhat about net file?\n\n454\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.490\nRight, we could do this.\n\n455\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.932\nAgain, use the net command,\nCD open files, that are there.\n\n456\n00:22:54.932 --> 00:22:57.890\nNow, again,\nkind of very basic information.\n\n457\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.246\nRight, what we can see here.\n\n458\n00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:01.330\nJust scroll over so we could take a look.\n\n459\n00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.460\nIdentifier, connection path, user name,\nand any file locks that may be in place.\n\n460\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.200\nVery basic information,\nbut still important.\n\n461\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.910\nBut if I wanted to get a little bit more,\nwhat if I did open files, right?\n\n462\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.589\nOpen files allows me essentially\nto see the same kind of thing.\n\n463\n00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:19.790\nIt rearranges the information.\n\n464\n00:23:20.862 --> 00:23:23.550\nGives me, more or less,\nthe same information essentially, right?\n\n465\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.950\nSo we could see that,\nwe could see what files are open.\n\n466\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.457\nBu if I want a little bit\nbetter of a thought process,\n\n467\n00:23:29.457 --> 00:23:33.066\nuse one of the system terminal's tools,\n.ps file.\n\n468\n00:23:33.066 --> 00:23:36.100\nAnd we sometimes get, if we're using\nit the first time, a little agreement.\n\n469\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.700\nSo we do that, and we do .ps files.\n\n470\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.600\nAnd we can see, again, basic information.\n\n471\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.380\nBut we see one additional piece\nthat we were missing in the others.\n\n472\n00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.040\nWhat's the access level,\nthe permission that we have to it.\n\n473\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.680\nAnd we could see that we're seeing those.\n\n474\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.829\nAnd we see that there are three.\n\n475\n00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.710\nAnd I'm reading, that's what I'm doing.\n\n476\n00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.910\nNow, is .ps files gonna have any\ncommands associated with it?\n\n477\n00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.854\nWell yeah, if we take a look,\nwe can look at them.\n\n478\n00:23:57.854 --> 00:24:01.104\nAnd we can see that we can provide\na connection to a remote computer.\n\n479\n00:24:01.104 --> 00:24:04.829\nSo I can do this from an external\nconnection to investigate a machine.\n\n480\n00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:08.428\nI can specify username and\na password for that remote connection.\n\n481\n00:24:08.428 --> 00:24:12.440\nI can look at the path.\n\n482\n00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.540\nI can close files.\n\n483\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.141\nSo that we don't wanna do that\nwhile we're investigating, but\n\n484\n00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:17.353\nI can close files if I need to.\n\n485\n00:24:17.353 --> 00:24:20.020\nIf I need to break a connection,\nbreak a lock, I can do that.\n\n486\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.540\nSo I've got the ability to be\nable to do this kind of stuff\n\n487\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.430\nright from within the tool set.\n\n488\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.160\nSo I can look at open files.\n\n489\n00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.590\nWe can also, I think I showed you already,\nwe did netstat,\n\n490\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.590\nwe looked at what you get with netstat.\n\n491\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.050\nBut let's look at something I\ndidn't show you with netstat.\n\n492\n00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:40.120\nNetstat is, if I spell,\nhere we go, netstat as a tool\n\n493\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.650\nshows me open network connections and\nthe ports and the information around them.\n\n494\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.703\nSo I can do this with netstat and get all\nof the general networking information,\n\n495\n00:24:48.703 --> 00:24:50.104\nagain, we wanna see that.\n\n496\n00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:52.231\nBut one of the things people\noften miss with netstat,\n\n497\n00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:53.610\nwe can look at the routing tables.\n\n498\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:58.054\nSo instead of having to do netstat and\nthen do route, print, separately,\n\n499\n00:24:58.054 --> 00:25:02.296\nI could combine the two and do netstat and\ninstead of that, just do -r.\n\n500\n00:25:02.296 --> 00:25:06.475\nAnd that would show me the network\nstatistics for the routing table,\n\n501\n00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:09.080\ninstead of having to just go and\ndo a route.\n\n502\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.890\nIt's kind of just combining the route\ncommand with the next at command,\n\n503\n00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.270\nit's just a subset of it.\n\n504\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.320\nSo I can get the routing table,\n\n505\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.400\nwhich would be obviously very important\ninformation for me to be aware of.\n\n506\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.110\nSo I could do that with net stat, or\n\n507\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:23.190\nI could do net stat minus a,\nlook at the open connections.\n\n508\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.779\nWhat about net biostatistics, so NBT stat.\n\n509\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.460\nMinus oops, hold on one second,\ndid I not spell that correctly, nbstat,\n\n510\n00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.420\nof course I always leave out a letter,\nnbtstat.\n\n511\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.640\nThere we go, minus c and when I do that\nI have no names in the cache right now,\n\n512\n00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.660\nI'm not using that BIOS\nto connect to anything.\n\n513\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.920\nBut if I start to ping machines or\nget information in there I would start to\n\n514\n00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.200\nresolve on that bio statement, so I can\nlook at the NBT stack cache to find that.\n\n515\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.187\nI could look at ARP.\n\n516\n00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:56.097\nAnd look at the ARP cache to be\nable to see what may be in ARP.\n\n517\n00:25:56.097 --> 00:25:58.870\nSo that would be another\none that maybe helpful.\n\n518\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.790\nSo if I do ARP, forward slash, question\nmark, I'll see that I can take a look.\n\n519\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:07.010\nIf I look at ARP minus Aa,\nwell okay say ,I will see whatever is in\n\n520\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.630\nthe outcast.I will be able to map\nIP addresses and MAC addresses.\n\n521\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.511\nSo that I can see what machines I have\nbeen connecting out to and/or what\n\n522\n00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:16.332\nmachines I have acknowledge of.\n\n523\n00:26:16.332 --> 00:26:19.504\nSo, it's kinda important for\nme to start to think about where\n\n524\n00:26:19.504 --> 00:26:22.980\nI'm I looking to capture\nsome of this information.\n\n525\n00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.080\nHow do I map or how do I understand\nport mappings and process mappings.\n\n526\n00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.060\nSo if I use Netstat as we were talking\nabout, going back to Netstat, but\n\n527\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:35.960\ninstead of minus c for\nthe cache I do minus o.\n\n528\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.621\nWhen I do, [SOUND] hold on one second.\n\n529\n00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:46.110\nThat's nbtstat, I want,\nnetstat, there we go.\n\n530\n00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.470\nRight idea, wrong command.\n\n531\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.300\nWhen I do netstat -o, we could see that we\nget some interesting information, right.\n\n532\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.400\nWe get protocols, we get local addresses.\n\n533\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.090\nIt's kind of crazy when\nit displays this way,\n\n534\n00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.380\nyou gotta output it to a files\nyou could actually work with it.\n\n535\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.360\nIt's a little bit easier to read, but\nyou could see I have foreign addresses,\n\n536\n00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.640\nI have the established date, and\nI have the PIDs, the processed IDs.\n\n537\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.980\nWhich is important again,\n\n538\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.570\nI can cross reference this information\nto what I'm seeing elsewhere.\n\n539\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.170\nSo if I wanted to output that information,\nI could take a look at it.\n\n540\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.724\nNow, there's some older tools that you\nmay have come across to do process and\n\n541\n00:27:17.724 --> 00:27:18.441\nport mapping.\n\n542\n00:27:18.441 --> 00:27:21.646\nThere's a tool called FPort\nthis was really popular for\n\n543\n00:27:21.646 --> 00:27:23.359\na long time from Blackstone.\n\n544\n00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:26.252\nBlackstone got bought out by\na bunch of different companies,\n\n545\n00:27:26.252 --> 00:27:28.096\nultimately I think Dell owns them now.\n\n546\n00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:31.211\nSo you can get this kind of a tool and\ndownload it if you use Fport,\n\n547\n00:27:31.211 --> 00:27:34.762\nwhich is an older tool, you can\nactually use that Fport through nestat.\n\n548\n00:27:34.762 --> 00:27:37.194\nYou do nestat minus Fport it\nwill probably up pour data and\n\n549\n00:27:37.194 --> 00:27:39.135\nshow it to you right from there as well.\n\n550\n00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:40.290\nSo that's kind cool.\n\n551\n00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.610\nYou can also look at what's running.\n\n552\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.135\nWe have really by passed the whole\nidea what tasks are there.\n\n553\n00:27:45.135 --> 00:27:47.445\nI've just shown you one\nway to pool process IDs.\n\n554\n00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:51.675\nBut what about if we wanna take a look and\nsee the full path to the executables, so\n\n555\n00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:55.630\nwhere is the image running from, the\ncommand line used to launch the process.\n\n556\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.770\nMay wanna know that.\n\n557\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.688\nHow much time processes have been running?\n\n558\n00:27:58.688 --> 00:28:01.580\nThese are all things that are really\nimportant that we have to be aware of, and\n\n559\n00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.050\nwe don't really have a good way\nof knowing that, as I said.\n\n560\n00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.652\nIf we go into Task Manager,\n\n561\n00:28:05.652 --> 00:28:09.909\nwe don't have any way of seeing how\nlong a process has been running here.\n\n562\n00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:14.479\nWe can go look at our fields and\ncolumn that we could select as you can\n\n563\n00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:18.200\nsee CPU time,\nthat would tell us execution time.\n\n564\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.400\nWe can take a look at a fairly\nlarge amount of information.\n\n565\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.700\nWe could see handles, we could see\nthe command line, we could see image path,\n\n566\n00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.010\nthings we definitely want to look at and\nthink about.\n\n567\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.632\nBut even if we put in command line,\nimage path name and\n\n568\n00:28:32.632 --> 00:28:36.843\nlet me put in we don't\ncare about the memory, but\n\n569\n00:28:36.843 --> 00:28:41.384\nlet me put in CPU time and\ndo that and just add that in.\n\n570\n00:28:41.384 --> 00:28:45.961\nWe'll see more information here but CPU\ntime is showing us the amount of time that\n\n571\n00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:49.549\nwe've been executing,\nthat's what we're seeing in there.\n\n572\n00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:54.194\nMemory, we're seeing CPU, we're seeing\nsession ID, we're seeing command lines\n\n573\n00:28:54.194 --> 00:28:58.220\nthat we are seeing now where we're\nexecuting and what's being used.\n\n574\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.510\nBut, again, we get to a point where this\nmay become problematic for us to pull\n\n575\n00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:05.430\ntogether and also to use, and there\nmay be a better way to deal with this.\n\n576\n00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.145\nSo if we go back to the command line,\nwe can use some of the built-in tools and\n\n577\n00:29:10.145 --> 00:29:13.108\nmore tools that are available\nfrom elsewhere.\n\n578\n00:29:13.108 --> 00:29:14.831\nWhat about Task List.\n\n579\n00:29:14.831 --> 00:29:18.336\nTask List is one of those tools that again\npeople don't always think about, but\n\n580\n00:29:18.336 --> 00:29:19.555\nit's built into windows.\n\n581\n00:29:19.555 --> 00:29:21.365\nAgain really helpful, you'll see if there.\n\n582\n00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:24.955\nTask List allows us to display a list\nof currently running processes.\n\n583\n00:29:24.955 --> 00:29:26.435\nAgain, locally or remotely.\n\n584\n00:29:26.435 --> 00:29:29.725\nSo, we can use this to do essentially\nwhat the Task Manager does,\n\n585\n00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:31.750\nthis is a non gui version.\n\n586\n00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.890\nAnd so we can go in and\nwe can read through there,\n\n587\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.030\nyou can look at all the different options.\n\n588\n00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.650\nYou'll see there's a bunch of\ndifferent stuff that gets displayed.\n\n589\n00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.030\nIf we do task list, and\ninstead of help we do v, for\n\n590\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.630\nverbose, we're gonna get all\nsorts of stuff in there.\n\n591\n00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.600\nNow again, the way it outputs, it's\nreally hard to read in the command line.\n\n592\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.410\nYou gotta throw this thing into a file and\n\n593\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.110\nwork with it offline to be able to see\nwhat's going on, cuz you can see it wraps.\n\n594\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.090\nThis is really hard to keep track of.\n\n595\n00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.810\nBut you could see that we have\na lot of information in here.\n\n596\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.830\nWe've got the process executable, the pig,\nwe've got information about execution time\n\n597\n00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:09.260\nmemory, the control account that's being\nused to run it, the ls it's running under,\n\n598\n00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.340\nit's a lot of information in here.\n\n599\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.913\nThis maybe one way to look at tasks and\n\n600\n00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:18.657\nto bring all that information together,\nanother would be Handle.\n\n601\n00:30:18.657 --> 00:30:22.870\nHandle is a tool, just go back up here and\nI think we probably,\n\n602\n00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.149\nI will probably bypass all that.\n\n603\n00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:31.896\nBut Handle is a tool that is going to\ncome from the sys internal's tool set.\n\n604\n00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:36.376\nThis is going to show us all the Handle\ninformation for the processes.\n\n605\n00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:40.789\nIt's gonna gives us very detailed\ninformation about what's running and\n\n606\n00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:45.268\nif look at it and take a look, a handle\nfor any one of these gives us the PID for\n\n607\n00:30:45.268 --> 00:30:49.181\nwhatever we're looking at,\ntells us what the information is and\n\n608\n00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:50.737\nthe identifiers for it.\n\n609\n00:30:50.737 --> 00:30:54.980\nThis gets into some very detailed\nforensic information we will look at and\n\n610\n00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.920\ntrack across a system, to be able to\nsee what kind of processes are running,\n\n611\n00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.770\nwhat memory space they may be\nassociated with what they're doing.\n\n612\n00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.770\nAnd we would then capture\nall this information.\n\n613\n00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.450\nAgain, this is all volatile information we\nwould want to have a record of to be able\n\n614\n00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.380\nto understand what was going on in the\nsystem at the time we were examining it.\n\n615\n00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.830\nWhat about all the DLLs that are running.\n\n616\n00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.950\nWe can list those as well.\n\n617\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.810\nAnother tool from the sys\ninternals tools set.\n\n618\n00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:25.150\nJust clear the screen, list DLLs.\n\n619\n00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.210\nLists every DLL that's\nrunning under every process.\n\n620\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.650\nAs you can see them scrolling\nthrough the screen there.\n\n621\n00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:35.470\nAnd allows us to get a list of all the\nDLLs associated with a process execution.\n\n622\n00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:41.320\nSo if I roll back up here,\nwhen I look at listdll 64.exe,\n\n623\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.850\nthe command I actually\nissued to run this program,\n\n624\n00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:48.270\nall the DLLs associated with this\nexecutable, can we see the executable\n\n625\n00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.560\nright there at the top, all the DLLs\nassociated with it are listed right here.\n\n626\n00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.343\nThis would be important for us to know,\nif I go up one, there's my listdlls.exe.\n\n627\n00:31:58.343 --> 00:32:01.002\nIf I start just looking\nthrough there's task manager.\n\n628\n00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:05.910\nSo for task manager, one of the DLLs\nassociated with task manager in Windows.\n\n629\n00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.397\nAll of these right here.\n\n630\n00:32:07.397 --> 00:32:11.829\nIf I see DLLs that don't look appropriate\nas I do a review of this offline later,\n\n631\n00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:15.336\nI can begin to understand\nthe programs have been manipulated,\n\n632\n00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:17.070\nthere maybe malware running.\n\n633\n00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.470\nThere could be a variety of things.\n\n634\n00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.540\nThis would help me to\nbegin to drill in and\n\n635\n00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.300\nunderstand what's been going on and what\nthe concerns may be that we would look at.\n\n636\n00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.940\nSo I've got the base information,\nwe've got the size and we've got the path.\n\n637\n00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.590\nThese can be used to validate the DLLs.\n\n638\n00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.400\nThey can be used to evaluate the DLLs and\n\n639\n00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.080\nto help us to understand whether\nthey've been modified or not.\n\n640\n00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.650\nSo we have a lot of different ways of\npulling all this information together.\n\n641\n00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.860\nLet's take a look at one more,\n\n642\n00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.370\na PS list which is another tool\nin the system internal tools set.\n\n643\n00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:50.930\n&gt;&gt; No wonder Microsoft acquired them, man.\n\n644\n00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThink about it, right.\n\n645\n00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.570\n&gt;&gt; Great tools for\nthe Windows environment.\n\n646\n00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n647\n00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.360\nNo doubt about it.\n\n648\n00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.380\nSo if you look at PSLists with\nthe x switch, I used the x switch,\n\n649\n00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.580\nyou can see that we get a list for\nevery process, there is PSList itself.\n\n650\n00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.810\nWe got the PID, process ID, VM,\nvirtual memory, we've got the work space.\n\n651\n00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:14.420\nWe've got the tracking information faults,\nnon-page and page memory.\n\n652\n00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.820\nYou'd just look at all this stuff,\n\n653\n00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.890\nthe user time, the kernel time,\nthe llapse time, the state running.\n\n654\n00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.220\nWe've got everything in here, the wait\nstate, almost everything is there.\n\n655\n00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.220\nAll the information that's in memory.\n\n656\n00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.410\nNow, we could take that information and\ncross reference it.\n\n657\n00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.750\nAnd validating it using\na memory dump tool.\n\n658\n00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.580\nSo for instance if I was to look at,\nwhere is it?\n\n659\n00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.890\nHere I actually didn't load it yet.\n\n660\n00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.290\nLet me show you something\nelse here real quick.\n\n661\n00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:43.669\nSo using the tool set, if I come down and\nI look at one of these two tools.\n\n662\n00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.570\nA tool called RAMMap which lets me map\nout all the information in memory.\n\n663\n00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.130\nThat's the actual memory itself,\nphysical RAM.\n\n664\n00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.250\nAnd our tool called VMMap.\n\n665\n00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.120\nLet's me map out all the virtual memory.\n\n666\n00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.530\nI can actually bring a tool like this up.\n\n667\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.450\nRun it on the system.\n\n668\n00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.988\nIt will ask me hey, what process do you\nwanna actually track in virtual memory?\n\n669\n00:34:06.988 --> 00:34:11.120\nNo big deal, grab a process,\nright see all my processes running.\n\n670\n00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.620\nRight, so let's say I wanna\nsee zoom it to our music.\n\n671\n00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.560\nWe wanna run zoom it.\n\n672\n00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.840\nSo let's track that.\n\n673\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.900\nSo do that, viewer running process and\n\n674\n00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.130\nthis is the memory map for\nzoom it right here.\n\n675\n00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:30.750\nThis is showing me in real time what\nthe virtual memory map is for this.\n\n676\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.420\nAs a forensic investigator,\nI want to look at all this information.\n\n677\n00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.180\nI want to see the memory, the committed,\nthe private, the working set.\n\n678\n00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.190\nI want to see all of\nthe different information.\n\n679\n00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.470\nAnd you could see what I'm able to\nlook at there as I scroll across.\n\n680\n00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.280\nI can see the address blocks, and actually\ngo in sector by sector, memory address by\n\n681\n00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.930\nmemory address, and break this down, and\ngo through and diagram out what's there.\n\n682\n00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:55.760\nAnd then examine it forensically\nto understand what was going on in\n\n683\n00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.640\nthe memory.\n\n684\n00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.350\nAnd where this memory was allocated and\n\n685\n00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:02.890\nwhat was using it at the time that I\ncaptured a machine using a tool like this.\n\n686\n00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.250\nThis is the real time tool that's\nshowing me this information.\n\n687\n00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.121\nI can go in and do the same thing for the\nphysical memory, but I can open up any one\n\n688\n00:35:10.121 --> 00:35:13.936\nof these address blocks and I can actually\ntake a look at what's happening and\n\n689\n00:35:13.936 --> 00:35:17.180\nwhat the protection level is in\nthat memory space in real time.\n\n690\n00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.940\nAll of this can be done against\nthe machine while I'm running it.\n\n691\n00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.680\nI can do the RAM app and actually dump the\namount of memory that's in there as well.\n\n692\n00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.330\nSee I have accessed all these tools and\nI have access to being able to take a look\n\n693\n00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.410\nat all the different ways\nwe're going to do this.\n\n694\n00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.480\nBut if we don't use something like\nthe memory tool that I just showed you,\n\n695\n00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.100\nwhat if we wanted to go in and\nuse command line tools.\n\n696\n00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.400\nThere are older tools you can find, the\ntool called PM Dump, Process Memory Dump,\n\n697\n00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.890\nit's hard to find these days,\nit's from a website that, when I checked\n\n698\n00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.610\nlast time the download was disabled,\nso it was tough to get a hold of.\n\n699\n00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.082\nBut if you have a copy of it and a lot of\nyou may if have been doing this work for\n\n700\n00:35:56.082 --> 00:35:58.884\na while, you'll find references\nto PM Dump and User Dump,\n\n701\n00:35:58.884 --> 00:36:01.410\ntwo very good tools to\nlook at process memory.\n\n702\n00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.505\nAlso, Process Explorer which is a tool\nthat is part of the system internal\n\n703\n00:36:05.505 --> 00:36:06.240\ntools set.\n\n704\n00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.060\nThis tool right here,\nit;s like a glorified task manager but\n\n705\n00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.790\nwith a lot more capabilities.\n\n706\n00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:15.330\nWe can open up the information here as\nyou can see and I'll just zoom in so\n\n707\n00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.880\nwe could take a look real quick.\n\n708\n00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.550\nWe could see any one of\nthe processes running.\n\n709\n00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.220\nYou could see CPU, Private Bytes, Working\nSet, PID, Description, Company Name,\n\n710\n00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.060\net cetera.\n\n711\n00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.020\nBut then up top here,\nI have a whole bunch of options.\n\n712\n00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.308\nAnd so I can go in, and\nI can just grab any one of these.\n\n713\n00:36:31.308 --> 00:36:35.472\nLet's just take a look at this, I can go\nahead and do the standard stuff, right?\n\n714\n00:36:35.472 --> 00:36:41.275\nI can set infinity, you can see how\nmuch I can do in the Task Manager.\n\n715\n00:36:41.275 --> 00:36:42.982\nI can kill processes.\n\n716\n00:36:42.982 --> 00:36:44.882\nI can restart, suspend.\n\n717\n00:36:44.882 --> 00:36:47.722\nI can launch Depends,\nwhich show me the Depend mapper.\n\n718\n00:36:47.722 --> 00:36:51.172\nSo it shows me all the DLL's, and\nthe dependent DLL's which is kind of cool.\n\n719\n00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:52.172\nI could create a dump file.\n\n720\n00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:53.112\nI'm gonna show you that in a minute,\n\n721\n00:36:53.112 --> 00:36:55.680\ncuz creating dumps is part\nof how we capture memory.\n\n722\n00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.600\nSo I could do a dump file right from here.\n\n723\n00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.640\nBut I can also check online\nvirus sites in real time\n\n724\n00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.110\nout of this tool to see if what I'm\nlooking at as a process may be a virus.\n\n725\n00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.556\nSo I have that capability built in,\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n726\n00:37:06.556 --> 00:37:10.440\nAnd I can search it online to see if I\ncould find out anything about the process\n\n727\n00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.240\nso I can better understand\nwhat it is as I'm running it.\n\n728\n00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.961\nWhich is actually kinda neat, whoops.\n\n729\n00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:17.420\nOkay, let's try that.\n\n730\n00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.750\nThere we go, whoops.\n\n731\n00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.755\nI think I just closed it.\n\n732\n00:37:19.755 --> 00:37:21.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me open it back up,\n\n733\n00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.280\nI hit the wrong key just\nwhile we're talking.\n\n734\n00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.060\nI wanted to show you one\nquick thing in there.\n\n735\n00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.210\nAnd I think the wrong, I was trying to\nget out, and I think I hit the wrong key.\n\n736\n00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:32.516\nSo where is it, there it is right there.\n\n737\n00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:35.470\nSo let me open this tool up.\n\n738\n00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.620\nAnd just run it as administrators,\ngive me a second to, bring that back up.\n\n739\n00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.330\nThere we go.\n\n740\n00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.830\nAnd so the other thing i wanted\nto show you was, I can go in and\n\n741\n00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.290\nI can create a dump from here,\na mini or a full dump,\n\n742\n00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.850\nyou could probably see\nthat if I scroll in.\n\n743\n00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.000\nAnd I can go in and\nI could create a dump file.\n\n744\n00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.040\nA lot of times people struggle\nto create dump files,\n\n745\n00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.210\nbecause essentially a dump file is\ncreated when the system crashes.\n\n746\n00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.391\nSo how do you create a dump\nwhen the system is running?\n\n747\n00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:04.653\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Without crashing it.\n&gt;&gt; Without crashing it, is the question.\n\n748\n00:38:04.653 --> 00:38:07.603\nBecause forensically that's gonna\nbe a challenge for us, right?\n\n749\n00:38:07.603 --> 00:38:12.950\nAnd so as a result,\nwe just wanna be aware of the fact.\n\n750\n00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.490\nI don't know why it's doing\nthat all of a sudden.\n\n751\n00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.580\nNow it's closing the program\nwhen I'm opening it.\n\n752\n00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.970\nSo when we open the program, right?\n\n753\n00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:24.650\nWe want to be able to use it\npotentially to create a dump file.\n\n754\n00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:29.200\nSo if we go and we do something like that\nand we go here and we create a mini or\n\n755\n00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.280\na full dump,\nwe do create full dump, right?\n\n756\n00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.050\nWe can do test d for test\n\n757\n00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:41.150\ndump, put that on our desktop,\nhit Save, right.\n\n758\n00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.610\nAnd that's going to out and\ncreate a dump file for us,\n\n759\n00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.151\nthen you dump that information.\n\n760\n00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:49.450\nWe can then use that to examine later,\nbecause we can then use that file that\n\n761\n00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:54.310\ndump file to be able to see information\nabout the memory and what was going on.\n\n762\n00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.360\nHere we should be able to see that.\n\n763\n00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.300\nWhen it's done,\nright there sitting on our desktop.\n\n764\n00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.940\nThere's our file.\n\n765\n00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.560\nWe could go in and\nobviously we would not open it right now.\n\n766\n00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.480\nWe only dumped one process,\nI didn't dump all the memory, so\n\n767\n00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.030\nit's very small,\nit's only about 38 meg's or so.\n\n768\n00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.910\nBut I could then load that into software\nthat could read the memory file, and\n\n769\n00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.520\nI would actually be able to forensically\nexamine what's going on in memory.\n\n770\n00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.150\nSo we would do this and\npush this out to an external drive,\n\n771\n00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.730\ncapturing what's going on in\nthe memory of the system.\n\n772\n00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.340\nAnd this would be one of the ways to\nforensically gather the memory so\n\n773\n00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.530\nthat we do so in a way that won't\ncompromise the machine, but\n\n774\n00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.110\nallows us to be able to interact with\nwhat's there and see it offline.\n\n775\n00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.340\nSo this would be one of the ways\nwe can gather that information.\n\n776\n00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.070\nSo, a lot of different options.\n\n777\n00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.950\nThis just scratching\nthe surface by that way.\n\n778\n00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.780\nWe just shown you five or\nsix different scenarios, five or\n\n779\n00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.130\nsix different sets of tools.\n\n780\n00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.910\nWe've got a lot more to go through about\nhow to capture not just volatile, but\n\n781\n00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.870\nnon volatile system information.\n\n782\n00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.208\nSo obviously we're gonna come back.\n\n783\n00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:52.910\nI'll continue to take a look at some\ncool things in the environment,\n\n784\n00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.810\nplay with a bunch of other tools and along\nthe way probably show you some interesting\n\n785\n00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:00.150\nthings about the registry cuz we haven't\neven really scratched the surface there.\n\n786\n00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.900\nAnd there's quite a bit of stuff going\non the registry you want to be aware\n\n787\n00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.320\nof when we do an examination\nof the machine.\n\n788\n00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.570\nI'm gonna be able to reach in and show you\nthe last 20 documents that were opened\n\n789\n00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.970\non this machine,\nwhether I was there or not.\n\n790\n00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.390\nI'm gonna show you the websites\nwe may have gone to.\n\n791\n00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.780\nWhether I was ever sitting there\nwatching you do it or not.\n\n792\n00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.030\nAll that's in the registry.\n\n793\n00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.180\nAll I have to do is know where to look and\nwhere to go.\n\n794\n00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.060\nMost people will clear information\nthinking it's gone, but\n\n795\n00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.112\nit actually is still resident there,\nyou just have to know where to look.\n\n796\n00:40:24.112 --> 00:40:27.400\n&gt;&gt; Part two sounds like it's gonna be\neven more exciting than this episode was.\n\n797\n00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.310\nA lot of interesting things\nthat are available for\n\n798\n00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.660\nus as forensic tools inside\nof a Windows environment.\n\n799\n00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.810\nSo make sure you go through\na few of the tools,\n\n800\n00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.280\nif not all of them that\nAdam has shown you today.\n\n801\n00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.970\nMake sure you get familiarized with it so\n\n802\n00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.450\nthat you can use it in\nyour environments as well.\n\n803\n00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.960\nThat being said, we we are well\nout of time for this episode.\n\n804\n00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.550\nBut definitely come back for part two,\ncuz we got plenty of more forensics\n\n805\n00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.580\ntechniques, and gathering and tools and\nthings that we can use in that coming up.\n\n806\n00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.780\nSo look forward to seeing you there.\n\n807\n00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.150\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n808\n00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:00.659\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host, Daniel\nLowrie, and we'll see you next time.\n\n809\n00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:08.504\n[MUSIC]\n\n810\n00:41:08.504 --> 00:41:10.965\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.486\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:12.300\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.080\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n6\n00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.765\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.690\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.500\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.239\nJoining us back for a little more on\nWindows forensics, is our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.840\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.530\nAdam, it's glad to have your back and\nhow are you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.100\n&gt;&gt; I am absolutely terrific.\n\n13\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.520\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; I believe, I think.\n\n14\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.980\nI'll leave that open to an interpretation.\n\n15\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.810\n&gt;&gt; I hear that.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n16\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.710\nI'm feeling good and\nlooking good, as they said.\n\n17\n00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.420\nRemember that from wow God.\n\n18\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.320\nNo, I'm having.\n\n19\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is it runs away from the.\n\n20\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.220\n&gt;&gt; Eddie Murphy and\nI can see his face, 48 hours.\n\n21\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Nick Nolte.\n\n22\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Nick Nolte, right?\n\n23\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.282\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that was a good movie.\n\n24\n00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:05.611\nAlso [CROSSTALK] he does, what was the\nother one he was in where he plays the,\n\n25\n00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.786\nhe's the criminal who Don Ameche rescues,\nthey make him into a banker.\n\n26\n00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:11.300\nDan Aykroyd's in it as well.\n\n27\n00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's Trading Places.\n\n28\n00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Trading Places.\n\n29\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.210\nRight, so feeling good Bobby Ray,\nlooking good.\n\n30\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.985\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, looking good Bobby.\n\n31\n00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Billy Joe, right.\nSo, all right anyway, we digress.\n\n32\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.540\nAs we often do here at movie/ITProTV.\n\n33\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n34\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.470\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue talking\nabout information gathering,\n\n35\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.560\nWindows forensics, volatile,\nnon-volatile information.\n\n36\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.550\nHow we gather that.\n\n37\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.600\nIn the last episode in our\nlast discussion, went through,\n\n38\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.700\nshowed you a bunch different ways to\nmanipulate the Windows command line,\n\n39\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.470\nused some tools from sysinternals,\nused some built in Windows tools and\n\n40\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.900\nthrough a variety of mechanisms and\ntechniques start to gather information.\n\n41\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.200\nI wanna show you another one that's\nkind of interesting that we can\n\n42\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.170\nplay with as well.\n\n43\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.180\nLet's just jump right back on in there.\n\n44\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.125\nI love that when I do that,\nit goes this way.\n\n45\n00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:51.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n46\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.130\nI love that if I do this,\nthere's no machine.\n\n47\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.730\nNow you see, you should have gone with\nthe other machine but it's not there so\n\n48\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.590\nyou can't do that,\ncuz I'm pointing to my machine,\n\n49\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.860\nnot that machine right over there.\n\n50\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500\nAnyway since now we're back.\n\n51\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.105\nThis is great.\n\n52\n00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:04.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I actually bought this,\n\n53\n00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.330\nthis reminds me.\n\n54\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.160\nDId you ever buy a Leap Controller?\n\n55\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.270\nRemember when Leap came out?\n\n56\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.898\n&gt;&gt; Vaguely, yes.\n\n57\n00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.580\n&gt;&gt; So they were the people\nthat came up with this idea,\n\n58\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.030\nbasically being able to use hand controls\nto be able to control the computer So\n\n59\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.870\nthey went through this whole thing and\nthey ultimately developed a product,\n\n60\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.190\nthey put it out and actually bought it,\nI thought it was so cool for teaching.\n\n61\n00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.640\nI could be in the back of\nthe class cuz I wander and\n\n62\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.970\nI could use my hands to be able to control\nthe machine, bring up PowerPoint slides,\n\n63\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.650\nall that stuff, so\nI actually went out and bought one.\n\n64\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.370\nIt's cool, and got it shipped to me.\n\n65\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.460\nI started using it.\n\n66\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.200\nAwesome product, it's kinda like that\nexcept that we actually have our own\n\n67\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.700\nlittle version of Leap out there with\ntwo feet and a pair of headphones and.\n\n68\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.840\n&gt;&gt; It's Bioleap.\n&gt;&gt; Easy, it's like Bioleap, right.\n\n69\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.650\nHe's making all the magic happen, so.\n\n70\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.410\nWe appreciate all the support we\nget while we're doing the shows.\n\n71\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.580\nNot just from Daniel and all the hosts,\nof course, and all the work we do.\n\n72\n00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.230\nBut all the people behind the camera and\nbehind the scenes that help us out and\n\n73\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.960\ndo all the stuff,\nit's also really important.\n\n74\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.720\nCome on, wave, show the good people out\nthere in studio TV land what's going on.\n\n75\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.260\nSo we just wanna say a big shout out of\nthank you to all the people that help\n\n76\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.520\nto make this craziness happen for\nyou, as we are saying.\n\n77\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.830\nSo we're gonna go back to my machine.\n\n78\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.520\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nanother interesting little tool.\n\n79\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.892\nI had mentioned this one, I think to you,\nright before we did the first session,\n\n80\n00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.846\nand I was talking about\nthe clipboard viewer.\n\n81\n00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I said take a look, and\n\n82\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.000\nyou were like that's kind of cool.\n\n83\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.290\nHaven't seen that before.\n\n84\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.840\nThere's a lot of tools out there that will\nlet us pull in not just the data we've\n\n85\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.770\nbeen talking about, but what about all\nthat stuff you put in to the clipboard?\n\n86\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.110\nIt's siting in registered cache in memory,\nbut again, it's volatile data.\n\n87\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.500\nIf we don't know it's there, we're gonna\nmiss out in a whole bunch of stuff that\n\n88\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.020\ncould, in theory, be incredibly valuable.\n\n89\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.480\nHo many times do you copy something,\nnot thinking about the fact that may or\n\n90\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.970\nmay not be important information.\n\n91\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.250\nYou may or\nmay not want the people to see and\n\n92\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.660\ndon't think about the fact it's sitting in\nthe computer after you use it, cuz it is.\n\n93\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.230\nBut you know when we shut the computer\noff, obviously it goes away.\n\n94\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.650\nBut if we don't shut the computer\noff before we try to investigate,\n\n95\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.040\nwe may find a bunch of stuff\nyou don't want us to see.\n\n96\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.010\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n97\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.200\nGot a program sitting here\ncalled Free Clipboard Viewer.\n\n98\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.930\nYou can see it right there, installed it.\n\n99\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.030\nAnd so what we're gonna do is take a look\nat that, let me just bring that up.\n\n100\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.330\nAnd so what I did is I went ahead and\n\n101\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.640\nI copied some stuff into\nthe Clipboard Viewer.\n\n102\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.030\nAnd when I did or\ninto the clipboard rather or\n\n103\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.000\nrather not the Clipboard Viewer,\nbut I copied that would be cool.\n\n104\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.197\nJust copy into the Clipboard Viewer,\nwhy do you have to do that?\n\n105\n00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:25.051\nI copied as you can see information\nI actually went and copied a little\n\n106\n00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:29.960\nPowerShell script that I'm gonna demo for\nI was too lazy that I've typed in again.\n\n107\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.780\nSo I typed it out forgot I hadn't put\nit on the right machine, copied it, and\n\n108\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.040\nyou can see a record of it\nsitting here in the share and\n\n109\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.390\nso or in the Clipboard Viewer rather.\n\n110\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.465\nSo when I copied it interestingly,\nyou want to something really cool?\n\n111\n00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.060\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n&gt;&gt; And see just how valuable this is.\n\n112\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.025\nSo I copied that from the host\nmachine that I already IP'd through.\n\n113\n00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; I didn't copy that on this desktop.\n\n114\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.970\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n115\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.260\nSo because of the VM sharing\noptions that they have.\n\n116\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.690\n&gt;&gt; Because I was actually on the host\nmachine on Windows 10 because we're going\n\n117\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.690\nto do PowerShell demo here because I\ndidn't want to do it in the server.\n\n118\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.490\nI'm going to do it for you in a little\nbit in PowerShell in Windows 10, but\n\n119\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.317\nI copied that in Windows 10 outside the\nRDP session and it picked it up running.\n\n120\n00:05:10.317 --> 00:05:10.920\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; So I\n\n121\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.250\nleft it running in the RDP session.\n\n122\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n123\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.430\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know it would do that,\nI never actually had thought about that.\n\n124\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.760\nIt picked up what I copied from\nthe desktop through the RDP session and\n\n125\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.340\nput it in the tool running it in RDP.\n\n126\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.550\nNow that is cool, because that,\nI did not realize what happened.\n\n127\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.880\nThat was actually neat,\nI had another file that I had copied.\n\n128\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.559\nYou saw me do some stuff\nfrom a PDF earlier.\n\n129\n00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.137\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Remember I was complaining about Office\n\n130\n00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:32.280\nnot being activated.\n\n131\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.370\nAnd I actually copied something totally\ndifferent and put it in there and\n\n132\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.320\nit swapped it for what I just copied now.\n\n133\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.290\nSo that is kind of cool\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n\n134\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.310\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it actually pulled\nit out of the host desktop\n\n135\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, this is an RDP session,\n\n136\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.440\nnot a virtual machine?\n\n137\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.910\n&gt;&gt; No, it's an RDP but\nit pulled this through the RDP.\n\n138\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.340\n&gt;&gt; That's insane.\n\n139\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.270\n&gt;&gt; I don't know the tool would do that.\n\n140\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.460\nThat's actually cool.\n\n141\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.270\nI mean just from a hacking standpoint,\na computer security standpoint,\n\n142\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.620\nit's got a lot of implications,\nbut that's just kind of cool.\n\n143\n00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.135\nI didn't realize a tool\nwould actually do that.\n\n144\n00:05:58.135 --> 00:05:59.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's something I didn't know.\n\n145\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.370\nI learned that in real time.\n\n146\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.330\nSo you see,\nyou can never know everything, right?\n\n147\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.780\nSo even when we're doing stuff.\n\n148\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.110\nSo a tool like this helps us to see\nwhat's in the cache when we copy.\n\n149\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.720\nAnd you can see, we've got the preview\nof the data that I just copied.\n\n150\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.520\nI can see it in unitext, which is not\nthe best way to view stuff like this.\n\n151\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.634\nBut if I have data that's from a log or\nsomething like that,\n\n152\n00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:22.514\nI want to look at it and then throw it\ninto a hex editor and interact with it.\n\n153\n00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:23.970\nI can do that from here.\n\n154\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.020\nI can look at the memory identifier.\n\n155\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.950\nI can actually see the text right there.\n\n156\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.100\nYou can see it as well as the the unicode,\nso\n\n157\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.120\nI can see the actual\nscript text right there.\n\n158\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.960\nI can see if there is any\nadditional information.\n\n159\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.760\nIt will show me what it is.\n\n160\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.820\nSo I can use a tool like this\nto look at whatever I've copied.\n\n161\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.520\nSo if there's something sitting in\nthe memory buffer, all I have to do is run\n\n162\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.380\nthis tool to expose it for\nme and give me a record of it.\n\n163\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.140\nOnce I have done that,\n\n164\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.510\ngot whatever it is, I can go in, I can\nsave that so I can get a record of it.\n\n165\n00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.520\nPull it out if I need to, right?\n\n166\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.560\nAnd I can interact with it.\n\n167\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.980\nSo, it's just kind of interesting.\n\n168\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.400\nA tool like this freely\ndownloadable off the web.\n\n169\n00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.090\nAgain, a lot of the tools I'm demoing for\nyou, not all of them, but\n\n170\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.720\nthe majority I'm going to mention or\nwork with are free.\n\n171\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.170\nBecause, number one we want you\nto be able to experience them,\n\n172\n00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.290\nwant you to be able to play with them and\ninteract with them yourself.\n\n173\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.550\nGood for you to practice, good for\n\n174\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.950\nyou to get some hands on,\ngood to build some skills, good for\n\n175\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.970\nyou to get ready for the CHFI exam to have\nknowledge of some of these kinds of tools.\n\n176\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.240\nSo it's always valuable for\nyou to be able to do that on your own.\n\n177\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.850\nBut also because the reality is that\na lot of these tools work really well.\n\n178\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.610\nAnd there's no reason to go out and\nspend hundreds of dollars\n\n179\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.500\nto get a tool that you could do the same\nthing with essentially for free.\n\n180\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.830\nFor free.\n\n181\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Our favorite price, free 99.\n\n182\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.490\n&gt;&gt; Our favorite price free.\n\n183\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.590\nAll right let's go back to where we were.\n\n184\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.060\nLet us take a look at another version of\na historical reference or road map tool.\n\n185\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.816\nThis one's built right into Windows,\none of my more favorite ones,\n\n186\n00:07:47.816 --> 00:07:49.319\nI'm going to call DOS key.\n\n187\n00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.717\nAnd what DOS key allows me to do, you'll\nsee absolutely nothing when I do it like\n\n188\n00:07:52.717 --> 00:07:54.720\nthat, cuz you have to read the help file.\n\n189\n00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.020\nBut if you put in the age for\nhistory switch.\n\n190\n00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.343\nWhat it does is it shows us a record of\nall of the different commands that we have\n\n191\n00:08:02.343 --> 00:08:05.467\ntyped into the DOS key buffer,\ninto the memory buffer,\n\n192\n00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:09.213\nthat keeps track of all the shell\ncommands in the Windows run line.\n\n193\n00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:12.969\nAnd you can see a reference to them right\nthere, some of the ones I've been using to\n\n194\n00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:15.320\ndemo and do some things with and\nwe can see them.\n\n195\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.965\nAnd so you can see a record of them there.\n\n196\n00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:20.195\nSo I can grab that information again,\ncould I sit here and\n\n197\n00:08:20.195 --> 00:08:23.170\nup arrow 20 times to get\neverything in there?\n\n198\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.820\nYeah, but am I gonna do that?\n\n199\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.420\nProbably not.\n\n200\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.230\nDo I wanna capture all of those commands?\n\n201\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.840\nAbsolutely, I wanna know what they are.\n\n202\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.700\nDOSKEY is gonna help me to do that.\n\n203\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.615\nJust run that and\nthen output the information, right?\n\n204\n00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:35.850\nSo, again,\nif I read the help file in Windows,\n\n205\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.460\nyou'd be amazed at the tools I find and\nthe things that I can do there, right?\n\n206\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.200\nIt's very simple,\nrelatively straightforward process to do.\n\n207\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.181\nI promised you a little foray\ninto the Windows registry.\n\n208\n00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:48.547\nWe're gonna take a look at that right now,\nso the first of the registry keys.\n\n209\n00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:53.119\nNow just so you know, every registry key,\nwe'll try that again slowly,\n\n210\n00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:57.322\nevery registry key that we actually\nare gonna demo or take a look at or\n\n211\n00:08:57.322 --> 00:09:02.455\nshow you or talk about, and there are many\nof them, are gonna be in the show notes.\n\n212\n00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:05.376\nSo I've given a complete set of them to\nDaniel, he's gonna provide them to you, so\n\n213\n00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:08.230\nthat way, you don't have to worry\nabout keeping up with everything I do.\n\n214\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.990\nThere is a lot of them in there, and\nsome of them are a little convoluted and\n\n215\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.840\ncomplex.\n\n216\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.370\nYou'll be able to follow along by looking\nat the notes if you wanna see them.\n\n217\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.220\nSo this one is gonna show us\nwhat shares exist on a system.\n\n218\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.620\nA lot of times, we'll walk up to a system,\n\n219\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.290\nespecially in Windows,\nwe don't have a clue what's shared.\n\n220\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.570\nI mean, there's no way to know.\n\n221\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:31.410\nIf I go in and I go to the Windows File\nExplorer, I go to the C:, I take a look.\n\n222\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.140\nDo I see an indication of any of\nthe folders that are shared here?\n\n223\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.900\nI mean, there's no way for me to know.\n\n224\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.150\nNow one of these folders is shared,\nI shared efstest, but\n\n225\n00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.100\nyou have no way of looking at that and\nseeing that.\n\n226\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.890\nI could go folder by folder looking,\nbut that's not very practical.\n\n227\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.570\nNow could I look at netshare, can I\nlook at monitor and different things?\n\n228\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.510\nAbsolutely, but just looking in here,\nI'm not gonna find that.\n\n229\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.980\nSo it may be tough for me to know.\n\n230\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.160\nThere definitely are ways to find out,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n231\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.110\nas Daniel was kinda, [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\nthe wheels were turning, he was like well,\n\n232\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.504\nwait a second, I know I could do that.\n\n233\n00:09:59.504 --> 00:10:00.655\nI've done that before.\n\n234\n00:10:00.655 --> 00:10:02.940\nBut at a certain point,\nwe used to show you in Windows Explorer,\n\n235\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.490\nwe used to show you that\nfolders were shared.\n\n236\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.090\nWe don't do that in certain versions\nof the Windows OS, so as a result,\n\n237\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.670\nit may be hard to find.\n\n238\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.820\nBut I can go into the registry and\nI can see in the registry key.\n\n239\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.440\nAnd by the way, I know it's hard to see,\nI'm gonna zoom in.\n\n240\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.240\nBut one of the reasons I like the reg\neditor is on the bottom down there.\n\n241\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.170\nCan we go full screen, so\nyou guys can see this?\n\n242\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.830\nOn the bottom of Reg Edit 32 over the reg\neditor, it shows you the path for\n\n243\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.400\nthe key you're in.\n\n244\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.970\nSo this is the path where I am right now.\n\n245\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.534\nI'm in the\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlS-\n\n246\n00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:40.158\net\\services\\LanmanServer\\Shares subfolder\nall the way down, key, right?\n\n247\n00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:45.180\nAnd in the shares key, I am looking\nat the list of shares on the system.\n\n248\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.600\nNow, up until the time I shared that\nEFS file, there were no shares here.\n\n249\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.320\nAll of a sudden, I share it,\nnow that shows up.\n\n250\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.230\nNow let me show you what you can find out\nabout a share, just from looking in here.\n\n251\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.640\nSo bring this up, and\nwe've got a wealth of information.\n\n252\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.020\nWe'll zoom in, so we you see this and\nsee what's there.\n\n253\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.123\nShows me maximum number of users,\nthe path, so it shows me the share path,\n\n254\n00:11:08.123 --> 00:11:08.980\npermissions.\n\n255\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.765\nNow you have to know what the numerical\nequivalence for permissions are.\n\n256\n00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:13.435\n9 is everyone, full control.\n\n257\n00:11:13.435 --> 00:11:15.730\nYou'd have to go look that up and\nfigure that out, of course.\n\n258\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.330\nThe share name, right, so\nit tells me what's going on.\n\n259\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.910\nSo I get some pretty\ngood information in here.\n\n260\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.430\nNow remember, this is the registry.\n\n261\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.990\nNow we agree, let's just all agree\non the following, we take a look,\n\n262\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.290\nhold on one second.\n\n263\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.690\nI've only got one share listed in\nthere right now as you can see, right?\n\n264\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.880\nBut this is the registry, thing we\nknow about the registry in Windows\n\n265\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.240\nis that it's a real time representation\nof the data in the system.\n\n266\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.910\nIf I create another share,\n\n267\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.860\nlogic would dictate that I\nshould see it represented there.\n\n268\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.070\nSo let's take a look.\n\n269\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.280\nLet's go in and let's go to the C drive,\nand let's share another folder.\n\n270\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:56.080\nI'm gonna come in here, and I'm gonna\nshare the, let's do image test folder.\n\n271\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.746\nLet's right click on that,\ngo to Properties, let's go to Sharing,\n\n272\n00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:05.390\nlet's go to Advanced Sharing, let's go to\nShare, let's go to Permissions, everyone.\n\n273\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.230\nAnd let's do everyone read,\ninstead of everyone full control, right?\n\n274\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.450\nSo we'll just give it\na slightly different,\n\n275\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.680\nthe standard default permission, right?\n\n276\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.200\nWe'll do that, click OK,\nclick Apply, click OK, click Close.\n\n277\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.520\nSo that one's been shared.\n\n278\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.000\nNow we don't see anything in here,\nbut this is Windows.\n\n279\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.600\nWe're famous for\nnot refreshing our interfaces, right?\n\n280\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.550\nSo all we have to do is simply go Refresh,\nand boom, in real time, what do we see?\n\n281\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.270\nSee another share that's there, and we see\nthat we're able to go in and get that.\n\n282\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.510\nSo we've actually created that share\nin real time, or near real time, right?\n\n283\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.930\nWe can just see them listed there,\nand we can go in,\n\n284\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.990\nand we can actually take a look.\n\n285\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.280\nAnd so we see that they do come in.\n\n286\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.046\nNow if I remove the share, I can also\nsee it update here in real time,\n\n287\n00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:46.150\nthis is the registry.\n\n288\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.300\nSo, my point is, this is volatile data,\n\n289\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.280\nthis is real time data based on\nthe current state of the system.\n\n290\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.710\nWhen I go in and I do a full backup,\na full bit stream copy of the drive,\n\n291\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.918\nam I getting all these settings?\n\n292\n00:12:56.918 --> 00:13:00.730\nAm I gonna be able to see all the shares\nthat were there at the moment I copy this?\n\n293\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.440\nAbsolutely because this is data stored\nin the hard drive of the system,\n\n294\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.455\nthe registry is not volatile, right?\n\n295\n00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:13.360\nThis is non-volatile data, but this is\ndata that represents the volatility,\n\n296\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.880\nthe state of the system at\nthe moment we capture it.\n\n297\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.130\nSo it's referenceable data\nthrough the bitstream copy.\n\n298\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.168\nBecause it is stored in the operating\nsystem on the hard drive.\n\n299\n00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.885\nAnd when I copy it, I could say at\nthat point in time, five months ago,\n\n300\n00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:28.860\nwhen this system was examined,\nthose shares existed.\n\n301\n00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.800\nThey may not have been\nthere ten months ago.\n\n302\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.460\nThey may not be there today.\n\n303\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.570\nBut they were there at\nthis moment in time.\n\n304\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.360\nSo it does give me an accurate\nrepresentation of the data that's there.\n\n305\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.160\nQuerying the register,\ngoing through and looking for\n\n306\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.490\nthis information,\nvery important to capture what's going on.\n\n307\n00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.600\nSo shares maintained by\na machine can be captured there.\n\n308\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.450\nNow again, shares are gonna come and go.\n\n309\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.580\nWe could theoretically say this is\nvolatile in a sense that somebody may\n\n310\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.800\ncreate a share and\nremove it in real time, but\n\n311\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.700\nwe have a record of it in the registry\neven though we shut the machine down.\n\n312\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.200\nThat's still gonna be there as\nlong as the shares are persistent.\n\n313\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.770\nMap drives and things like that, right?\n\n314\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.610\nThey're not just transitory shares.\n\n315\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.990\nWe connect to a machine for\n\n316\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.940\na couple of minutes to grab something and\nthen break the connection.\n\n317\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.170\nThat's gonna come and go, right?\n\n318\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.300\nBut anything we map that's a guaranteed\nshare, it's gonna be there,\n\n319\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.390\nthat's a hard wired one,\nis gonna be there regardless.\n\n320\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:19.028\nNow, something else we can look at in the\nregistry, we look at files all the time,\n\n321\n00:14:19.028 --> 00:14:21.395\nand we often take for granted what we see.\n\n322\n00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:22.800\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n323\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.640\nWe see date modified and\nlast accessed information on most files.\n\n324\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.540\nWe can go in, we can take a look,\nwe can go to Properties.\n\n325\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.690\nWe can see modified, accessed, etc.\n\n326\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.360\nWe actually can turn on and\noff the descriptors in the registry\n\n327\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.870\nthat allow us to capture that Information,\nthere's a register key that does that.\n\n328\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.110\nMost people don't realize that, but\nwe could disable last access update and\n\n329\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.100\nprevent files from telling us\nwhen they were last accessed.\n\n330\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.020\nBad actors will often do this to prevent\nus from seeing that information.\n\n331\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.070\nNow, this is not one of those hey, we've\ngotta go in, we've gotta look for it,\n\n332\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.060\nwe've gotta know it's there and\nnot there kinda thing.\n\n333\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.290\nSo you just have to know that this can be\ndone by somebody who's looking to cover\n\n334\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.270\ntheir tracks.\n\n335\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.480\nThe way you can check to see if this is\ndone is what I wanna quickly show you\n\n336\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.050\nin the registry.\n\n337\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.990\nLook for the key, in other words,\nthat may have this set up.\n\n338\n00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.430\nSo let's take a look at this,\nI'm gonna show you two things.\n\n339\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.550\nIf we're doing this on a local system,\nit'll be one set.\n\n340\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.140\nIf we're doing it on with FAT versus NTFS,\nso\n\n341\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.430\nwe'll just take a look at\na couple of different ones.\n\n342\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.012\nSo HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,\nwhere we are already,\n\n343\n00:15:21.012 --> 00:15:23.970\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control File\nSystem.\n\n344\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.640\nWe're gonna back up cuz\nwe're in services\\Lanman, so\n\n345\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.300\nwe're gonna go up a little bit, and\njust back out of where we are, and\n\n346\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.510\nwe're gonna take a look at this.\n\n347\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.340\nSo, we're gonna back up to the top here,\ncuz as I said, it's kind of a crazy place.\n\n348\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.270\nInstead of services,\nlet's come out to CurrentControlSet,\n\n349\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.980\nand we're gonna go to Control.\n\n350\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.580\nAnd in Control,\nwe're gonna go to File System, right here.\n\n351\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.770\nAnd up under File System,\njust gonna examine this, move this out.\n\n352\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.670\nWe would see two different keys here.\n\n353\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.506\nWe would see Disable, Delete Notification,\nanother one we can look at,\n\n354\n00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:55.848\nalthough We're not looking at that right\nnow, but DisableDeleteNotification, if I\n\n355\n00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:58.990\nset that up, that doesn't tell me when\nI delete something, it just deletes it.\n\n356\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.752\nNo, I'll reference it in fact,\nyou know how we get that prompt,\n\n357\n00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:02.820\nare you sure you want to?\n\n358\n00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.620\nWe can block that, so we're not gonna see\n\n359\n00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.630\nthe two keys that I'm talking about\nbecause they have not been created here.\n\n360\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.650\nBut if I wanted to create them, what I\nwould do is I would come in here, and\n\n361\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.717\nI would do, actually no, last access\nupdated, it is there, I put the one in for\n\n362\n00:16:15.717 --> 00:16:16.930\nNTFS, I forgot it was there.\n\n363\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.820\nSo LastAccessUpdate you'll see\nis right there, I can go in, and\n\n364\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.720\nI can actually set this.\n\n365\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.080\nYou'll see it's either set to 1, or\nI can go in and set it to 0, and\n\n366\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.850\nI can change this, and this is what\nit will do in the NTFS file system.\n\n367\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.380\nI modify that key and\nmodify that behavior,\n\n368\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.510\nit will actually stop telling me when\nthe LastAccessUpdate or stop recording\n\n369\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.840\nthat information in the file system, so\nI could see that also disablelastaccess.\n\n370\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.850\nThis is an NTFS system, so\nit's not gonna show me the FAT one, but\n\n371\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.460\nif I go into a system that's using FAT and\ninstalled on FAT,\n\n372\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.570\ninstead of NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate,\nit would simply be disablelastaccess.\n\n373\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.840\nSo it will be a slightly different key,\nbut\n\n374\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.110\nit will essentially do the same thing,\nso you just wanna be aware of that.\n\n375\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.292\nWe also have the ability to be\nable to go in and take a look at,\n\n376\n00:17:01.292 --> 00:17:05.305\nI gotta change that, I have a little typo\nin one of my keys for you in the notes.\n\n377\n00:17:05.305 --> 00:17:08.040\nWe'll have to do, there's a little space I\njust realized, we'll have to fix that one.\n\n378\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.771\nWhat about all the security IDs for\nusers in the system?\n\n379\n00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:14.655\nIf we wanna see some of the security\nIDs and see what those are on a system,\n\n380\n00:17:14.655 --> 00:17:17.088\nif we have more than one user,\nfor instance.\n\n381\n00:17:17.088 --> 00:17:21.138\nA lot of times you will have just\na standard user on a simple machine,\n\n382\n00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:22.790\nnothing more than one.\n\n383\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.020\nBut I have, for instance, four or\n\n384\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.190\nfive aliases on my real machine\nthat I use all the time.\n\n385\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.870\nI got a bunch of different user accounts\nI log on under to do a variety of things.\n\n386\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.850\nSo I would see or\nfive different users in the system, and\n\n387\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.780\ncertain systems where we\nmay have rotating users.\n\n388\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.276\nLike in a shop, let's say, where it's a\n24-by-7 operation, people come and go and\n\n389\n00:17:42.276 --> 00:17:44.538\nyou wanna see which users\nare on the machine.\n\n390\n00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:48.538\nYou'll have multiple profiles, every one\nof those users has a security identifier\n\n391\n00:17:48.538 --> 00:17:50.730\nassociated with it, a security SID.\n\n392\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.550\nSo we wanna go and take a look for those,\nI'm gonna show you how to find those and\n\n393\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.910\njust where to go to take a look at them,\nbecause that may be helpful for\n\n394\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.480\nsomeone who may wanna know how to do that.\n\n395\n00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.542\nSo again, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, but\n\n396\n00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:05.490\nin this case we're gonna go into software\ninstead of system and where we are.\n\n397\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.496\nSo we're just gonna roll that up,\ncome into Software, under Software,\n\n398\n00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:11.960\nwe're gonna go to Microsoft, which is\nwhere quite a bit of this takes place.\n\n399\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.850\nUnder Microsoft,\nwe're gonna go down to Windows NT,\n\n400\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.700\nso I'm gonna come all the way down.\n\n401\n00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:19.110\nDown towards the bottom,\ngo into Windows NT,\n\n402\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.590\nit's amazing they still call it\nWindows NT instead of Windows.\n\n403\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.200\nWe're gonna go in there, go to\nCurrentVersion, and under CurrentVersion,\n\n404\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.670\nwe are gonna have ProfileList.\n\n405\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.330\nSo let's just come down here,\nwhere is that ProfileList, right there.\n\n406\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:39.050\nAnd under ProfileList, let's move this\nover, you will see that we have over here,\n\n407\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.290\nand I know it's kinda hard to see, I will\nmove over, and I will zoom in for you.\n\n408\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:49.070\nWe've got a list of different users,\nS-1-5-18, 19, 20, 21, etc.\n\n409\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.243\nThose are all individual user\naccounts that have been logged in or\n\n410\n00:18:52.243 --> 00:18:56.221\nexist as profiles on this machine, and\nevery one of them has a unique identifier,\n\n411\n00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:59.069\nand every one of them has\ninformation associated with it.\n\n412\n00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:03.613\nWe can see here REG_DWORD, the actual\nsystem profile that's there, and\n\n413\n00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:08.030\nwe've got some other data that's here for\nthe SID and the actual state.\n\n414\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.450\nNow the SID right there, the security\nidentifier, that string 01 01 whatever\n\n415\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.150\nwhatever, that's the actual security\nidentifier right there for the user.\n\n416\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.290\nSo we could take that,\ngo back to the local SAM hive or\n\n417\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:26.705\nto the domain controller if this is\na directory with an LDAP solution,\n\n418\n00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:29.555\nand I could then actually track that and\nfigure out what user that is, or\n\n419\n00:19:29.555 --> 00:19:32.425\npotentially use that to\nfind what user that may be.\n\n420\n00:19:32.425 --> 00:19:35.665\nAs a forensic examiner, I'd want to\nfigure that out and know that, and\n\n421\n00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:38.035\nI could actually use this to go in and\ntake a look.\n\n422\n00:19:38.035 --> 00:19:42.025\nBecause if I take a look at some of these,\nyou'll see the next one down, 19,\n\n423\n00:19:42.025 --> 00:19:47.210\nis a LocalService account, so\nit's a different machine account.\n\n424\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.870\nAnd notice it is not logged in, we don't\nnormally use it, it's used to proxy\n\n425\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.383\non behalf of other stuff, it doesn't\nhave a security ID associated with it.\n\n426\n00:19:54.383 --> 00:19:58.120\nRight here, network service again,\nlocal account used as a service account,\n\n427\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.810\nno security ID associated with it.\n\n428\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:04.265\nYet this one here is my actual user\naccount that I'm logged on as,\n\n429\n00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.570\nthat's the administrator.\n\n430\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.460\nThere's the SID for\nthe administrator right there, but\n\n431\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:15.086\nit also tells me in the profile path,\nWhat the name of the user is right there,\n\n432\n00:20:15.086 --> 00:20:16.720\nC:\\Users\\Administrator.\n\n433\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.690\nSo it actually does give me information,\n\n434\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.880\nlet's me walk through the registry looking\nfor all the users that are available\n\n435\n00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.150\non this machine and/or that have\naccounts here that I can interact with.\n\n436\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.679\nAgain, would I wanna have\nall this information?\n\n437\n00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:29.521\nThis would be really valuable for\n\n438\n00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.150\na CHFI as we're doing a forensic\nexamination of the system.\n\n439\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.130\nNow, are we gonna get this when we\ndo a bitstream copy of the drive?\n\n440\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.330\nAbsolutely, because remember,\n\n441\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.160\nthis is in the registry, right,\nthis is what we're gonna see.\n\n442\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.580\nNow, let's go take a look at\nsomething really quickly on Windows.\n\n443\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.790\nSo on Windows 10, on the host machine,\nthat we're already pinging out of,\n\n444\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.040\nright, little bit updated\nversion of Windows.\n\n445\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.120\nLet's go into the Registry Editor,\n\n446\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.375\nwe're gonna go here,\nsame idea, we're gonna go and\n\n447\n00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:55.890\nwe're gonna take a look at the same key,\nand let's take a look at what we find.\n\n448\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.273\nSo we're gonna go into\nLOCAL_MACHINE SOFTWARE, LOCAL_MACHINE,\n\n449\n00:21:00.273 --> 00:21:03.849\nSOFTWARE, and\nwe're gonna drill down into Microsoft.\n\n450\n00:21:03.849 --> 00:21:08.587\nAnd we're gonna drill down\nhere all the way down into,\n\n451\n00:21:08.587 --> 00:21:14.046\nI'm just gonna move this over so\nyou can see here, Windows NT,\n\n452\n00:21:14.046 --> 00:21:21.390\ninto CurrentVersion, let's go down into\nProfileList, L M N O P P P, ProfileList.\n\n453\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.440\nAnd we've got some additional users here,\n\n454\n00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.110\nlet me just show you, okay,\nthat's probably a little too far over.\n\n455\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:34.180\nThe ones that are of interest to us\nare the ones that are gonna have the very\n\n456\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.880\nlong strings associated with them,\nI'm not running zoom-in on this one.\n\n457\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.153\nBut you can see over here this one is\nthe Nate user, that's Nate's account to\n\n458\n00:21:43.153 --> 00:21:47.515\nlog in that I'm essentially proxying\nunder, so we could see that user there.\n\n459\n00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.419\nAnd this one is the host account,\n\n460\n00:21:49.419 --> 00:21:53.060\nthe account that he gave me for\nhost that I'm using as well.\n\n461\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.630\nSo I can, again, go through, step through,\nand see the individual users.\n\n462\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.872\n18, 19, and 20 are always gonna be\nthe same, LocalService account,\n\n463\n00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:01.650\nthe NetworkService account, etc., but\n\n464\n00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.590\nI could see individual users by going\nthrough and actually seeing what is there.\n\n465\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.610\nI could take a look at them,\nand I can actually interact and\n\n466\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.010\nforensically examine them and\nsee that I have, in this case,\n\n467\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.247\ntwo separate, uniquely identified\nusers in the Windows 10 machine.\n\n468\n00:22:15.247 --> 00:22:18.465\nSo even on the more recent operating\nsystems, the reg key is the same,\n\n469\n00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:21.135\nit's almost without exception,\ngonna translate in there,\n\n470\n00:22:21.135 --> 00:22:24.525\nand we're gonna be able to take a look and\nsee that information.\n\n471\n00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:27.502\nIt's gonna be the same, and\nit's gonna look and feel the same for\n\n472\n00:22:27.502 --> 00:22:29.452\nus, regardless of operating system.\n\n473\n00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:33.028\nSo wanted to just show that to you,\nit's obviously helpful to be able to track\n\n474\n00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:36.455\nthrough those users, see who's in there,\nunderstand more about them.\n\n475\n00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:39.242\nWhat about what's running\nin the system in real time?\n\n476\n00:22:39.242 --> 00:22:42.862\nWe took a look at Process Explorer,\nand in Process Explorer,\n\n477\n00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:47.137\nif you remember, we saw that we could\nsee the processes that are running.\n\n478\n00:22:47.137 --> 00:22:51.750\nBut while Process Explorer is essentially\nTask Manager with more details, it may not\n\n479\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.297\nalways show us everything, we may wanna\nuse another tool, a tool called Autoruns,\n\n480\n00:22:56.297 --> 00:22:59.646\nwhich is right here,\nanother one of the Sysinternals tools.\n\n481\n00:22:59.646 --> 00:23:03.593\nThis tool is actually a pretty cool tool,\nit is a like a Task Manager, but\n\n482\n00:23:03.593 --> 00:23:07.346\nwhat it's gonna do for us is it's\ngonna allow us to see the reg keys for\n\n483\n00:23:07.346 --> 00:23:10.820\neverything that's running and\ndrill in and find out the path.\n\n484\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.684\nAnd it's gonna break it down for us,\n\n485\n00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:16.364\nif you wanna take a look here real\nquick with me, it shows us everything.\n\n486\n00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:19.448\nAnd look at the different tabs,\nwhat's running at log on,\n\n487\n00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:23.951\nwhat's running in the Explorer, what's\nrunning for IE, what are scheduled tasks,\n\n488\n00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:28.050\nwhat services are running, what drivers\nare loaded, what codecs are there.\n\n489\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.695\n&gt;&gt; Well, that seems useless.\n\n490\n00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:33.560\n&gt;&gt; What boot execute is there, what image\nhijacks, what's running for Office.\n\n491\n00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.270\nTop right-hand corner,\ngoing back the other way, Sidebar Gadgets,\n\n492\n00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.880\nthat's like a Windows Vista thing,\nwe don't really see those.\n\n493\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.868\nBut what's running through WMI,\nnetwork providers that are running,\n\n494\n00:23:43.868 --> 00:23:47.594\nthe LSA providers for\nsecurity authentication, print monitors,\n\n495\n00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:49.633\nthe SOX providers, and known DLLs.\n\n496\n00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:54.212\nSo I can subcategorize this information,\nso Adobe's running, for instance,\n\n497\n00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:55.370\nI could take a look.\n\n498\n00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:01.150\nI highlight it, it's gonna show me\nwhat is running there for Adobe.\n\n499\n00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.610\nIt's gonna show me the size,\nthe time that Adobe was launched,\n\n500\n00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.930\nthe version, the path for\nthe executable, all that.\n\n501\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.770\nSo that's all good.\n\n502\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.660\nIt's gonna show me the reg\nkey that it's running under.\n\n503\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.720\nSo in the system,\nit's running under HKEY LM.\n\n504\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.350\nSo HKEY Local Machine software WOW64\n32NEW, Microsoft's current version Run.\n\n505\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.020\nSo it's showing me that's\nwhat is running under.\n\n506\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.860\nIn addition.\n\n507\n00:24:32.612 --> 00:24:36.622\nI can right-click on the REG key I can\ncopy it, I can jump to entry, jump to\n\n508\n00:24:36.622 --> 00:24:41.530\nimage, search online and see if that's\na legitimate key or if it's been modified.\n\n509\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.660\nI can do a find to find other\ninstances of it, right?\n\n510\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.153\nI can go right-click on\nthe program itself that's running.\n\n511\n00:24:50.153 --> 00:24:55.060\nI have the ability to delete, which,\nyou know, may or may not be helpful.\n\n512\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.800\nCopy it, I can verify the image.\n\n513\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.290\nAgain, check online to see if it's\na virus so I can do Process Explorer,\n\n514\n00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.180\nI can jump into the other tool,\nsee what's running, and\n\n515\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.630\nI can look at properties of it to see\nif it's been modified in some way.\n\n516\n00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.160\nSo I have a lot of power to drill down and\ninteract here.\n\n517\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.990\nI can go ahead and I can do a save and\nI can pull all the information\n\n518\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.100\nthat I find with these tools so\nI can forensically examine it offline.\n\n519\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:25.200\nI can, as you can see, look at a bunch\nof options and look at different things.\n\n520\n00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.130\nI can go in and\nlook at the registry sub keys from here.\n\n521\n00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.870\nSo I can see everything that's running.\n\n522\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.960\nJust the stuff that runs at logon,\nessentially at startup.\n\n523\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.470\nSo I can drill in and just see what's been\nset to run at startup, which is one of\n\n524\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.320\nthose things that we often don't know and\nreally are never sure of in a machine.\n\n525\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.380\nNow I'm gonna show you in the register\nwhere we can go to figure that\n\n526\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.240\nout as well.\n\n527\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.919\nBut you'll see here that I can go into\nseveral different places to see things\n\n528\n00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:47.846\nthat run at logon.\n\n529\n00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:51.640\nI've got the Adobe Acrobat Reader\nrunning there.\n\n530\n00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.730\nI've got some Microsoft stuff apparently.\n\n531\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.127\nAnd it's in different software or\n\n532\n00:25:55.127 --> 00:25:57.290\ndifferent register keys\nif you take a look.\n\n533\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.920\nSo it's gonna profile all that out for\nme and show me all that right?\n\n534\n00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.287\nAnything that's running\nhere as you can see,\n\n535\n00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:07.476\nanything that's running through the\nInternet Explorer, all the information,\n\n536\n00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:09.677\nall the helper objects which is also nice.\n\n537\n00:26:09.677 --> 00:26:14.170\nSo all the dll's and executable's are\nreferenced here with autorun's as well.\n\n538\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.460\nA lot of times we'll have scheduled\ntasks that we may not be aware of.\n\n539\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.830\nSo if somebody's put an hour in the system\nwe want to find out if it's being\n\n540\n00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.820\ntriggered to run.\n\n541\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.790\nScheduled tasks will help us to do that.\n\n542\n00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.270\nWe can actually see those here.\n\n543\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.020\nIn addition, we can go in and\nwe can interact with them.\n\n544\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.656\nSo we can disable them,\nor do what we need to do.\n\n545\n00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:35.610\nAnd services,\nwe can see the services that are running.\n\n546\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.578\nSo I can go in and if I wanna go in and\ntake a look I can look at, whoops,\n\n547\n00:26:39.578 --> 00:26:40.783\nhold on one second.\n\n548\n00:26:40.783 --> 00:26:43.990\nThat was a DLL, didn't wanna do that.\n\n549\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.500\nThat's the one we wanted right there.\n\n550\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.670\nWe could see the properties\nof the executable, right.\n\n551\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.490\nSo we can actually pull up\nthe properties of the executable and\n\n552\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.250\nfind out information about it.\n\n553\n00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.410\nSo it's just, it's bringing all\nthat information together for us.\n\n554\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.560\nIn one place so that's very helpful.\n\n555\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.860\nSo, this is autorun.\nThis helps us to see\n\n556\n00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.880\nwhat's happening under\nthe hood in real time.\n\n557\n00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.418\nYou remember a tool called Hijack This?\n\n558\n00:27:03.418 --> 00:27:04.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n559\n00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:06.260\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like Hijack This,\nright?\n\n560\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.800\nIt lets us see what's going on and\nlets us see what's running in real time.\n\n561\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.990\nSo, it's very valuable for\nus to be able to to do that sometimes.\n\n562\n00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.200\nWhat about event logs, right?\n\n563\n00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.340\nEvent logs have a wealth of information.\n\n564\n00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.340\nAnd then we often sometimes overlook and\ndon't think about that.\n\n565\n00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.180\nBut if we go into the Control Panel and we\ngo in and we take a look at administrative\n\n566\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.750\ntools as I'm doing here and\nwe go into Event Viewer.\n\n567\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.932\nWhat we're gonna be able to find in\nthe Windows system is there's a bunch of\n\n568\n00:27:29.932 --> 00:27:31.558\ndifferent logfiles that will exist.\n\n569\n00:27:31.558 --> 00:27:36.279\nUnder Windows logs we have out traditional\napplication, security, system,\n\n570\n00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:37.450\nwe have setup.\n\n571\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.760\nBut there are so many additional logs.\n\n572\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.510\nThere's a hardware events log.\n\n573\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.790\nInternet explorer.\n\n574\n00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.460\nKey management.\n\n575\n00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.520\nThere's a bunch of logs under\nMicrosoft Windows that most people\n\n576\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.760\ndon't realize in later operating systems,\nif I can get that to move.\n\n577\n00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.080\nIn later operating\nsystems we have logs for\n\n578\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.150\nall sorts of stuff as you can see here.\n\n579\n00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.760\nAnd the idea of being able to go in and\ninteract with the log,\n\n580\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.910\nwe can bring that up.\n\n581\n00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.380\nWe can look at the log in\nreal time as you see there.\n\n582\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.150\nWe can right click,\nwe can certainly export the log.\n\n583\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.420\nWe can interact with it.\n\n584\n00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.290\nBut if we go take a look,\nwe go to properties,\n\n585\n00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.600\nwe could see where the logs\nactually are stored, right?\n\n586\n00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.120\nAnd we can see the path for\nthat right here.\n\n587\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:26.470\nAnd so if I go in here,\nJust get that out of the way real quick.\n\n588\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.050\nAnd I come back and\n\n589\n00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:35.128\nI paste that in you know what we're\nseeing is the default path for the log,\n\n590\n00:28:35.128 --> 00:28:40.840\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Winevt\\Logs and then\nwhatever the application security, etc.\n\n591\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.144\nSystemRoot is usually C colon\nback slash Windows right?\n\n592\n00:28:43.144 --> 00:28:48.470\nOr whatever it may be so\nif I go to that path right and I go in.\n\n593\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.800\nAnd I want to find those\nlogs which I can easily do.\n\n594\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.630\nNever want to hit the clear log button\nbefore you do this though otherwise\n\n595\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.710\nthe demo is just not as powerful\nas it would be otherwise.\n\n596\n00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.666\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't have the same\npunch as it would have had.\n\n597\n00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:00.704\nRight?\n\n598\n00:29:00.704 --> 00:29:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Not quite the same demo\nif you hit clear logs first.\n\n599\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.493\nYou'll find stuff but\nthere won't be anything there of value.\n\n600\n00:29:05.493 --> 00:29:11.843\nIf we go to open Windows Explorer and\nwe do C colon backslash Windows, and\n\n601\n00:29:11.843 --> 00:29:18.606\nwe paste the rest of that path, because\nI'm just too stinking lazy to type and\n\n602\n00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:22.690\nwe go in there and\nwe'll see all the log files.\n\n603\n00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.155\nAnd we can see that we've got\nall of our log files sitting.\n\n604\n00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:28.550\nWill we want to capture all this data?\n\n605\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.085\nAbsolutely.\nAre we going to get it as part of our\n\n606\n00:29:30.085 --> 00:29:31.630\nbit-stream copy of the hard drive?\n\n607\n00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.960\nAbsolutely, it's not volatile data, it's\nsitting there stored in the hard drive,\n\n608\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.360\nI do a bit-stream copy of it\nI have all those log files,\n\n609\n00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.430\nI can go through them at will, whenever\nI wanna go into look at them offline.\n\n610\n00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.360\nSo I'm gonna get all this\ndata once I do the capture.\n\n611\n00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.010\nDo I wanna open a log and look at it\nin real-time while I'm on the machine?\n\n612\n00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.900\nAbsolutely not because I will modify\nthat log potentially and interact\n\n613\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.530\nwith it in a way that could damage the\ninformation from a forensic standpoint.\n\n614\n00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.070\nSo I don't wanna be viewing these\nlogs in real time on the machine.\n\n615\n00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.240\nI wanna take a look at them in\na controlled environment after I've done\n\n616\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.820\na bit stream copy of them.\n\n617\n00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.080\nNow can I take a copy of one of\nthese logs by right clicking,\n\n618\n00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.200\ndoing copy without modifying it?\n\n619\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.160\nYeah I could but\nremember if I don't paste that file\n\n620\n00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.230\non into a forensically sound device\nit's gonna have a write blocker.\n\n621\n00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:22.060\nI'm gonna have a problem because at that\npoint I may modify by writing back to\n\n622\n00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.800\nthe system, updating the access date and\ntime stamp, things like that.\n\n623\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.880\nSo that's gonna be a problem.\n\n624\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.610\nSo normally, we don't wanna mess with\nthese files while the system is on.\n\n625\n00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.735\nWe only wanna work with them,\n\n626\n00:30:31.735 --> 00:30:33.897\ninteract with them after\nthe system has been turned off.\n\n627\n00:30:33.897 --> 00:30:39.720\nAnd so, that's just something to consider\nand think about just to protect that data.\n\n628\n00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.940\nMake sure that we don't\nhave a problem with it.\n\n629\n00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.625\nWhat about data in the web caches?\n\n630\n00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:49.810\nThings like index dat files for\nIE where we can look at our cache files.\n\n631\n00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.240\nThese are often overlooked.\n\n632\n00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.555\nPeople don't realize that they exist but\nthere's a lot information\n\n633\n00:30:56.555 --> 00:31:00.035\nthat we can go in and take a look\nat on the system, in the web files.\n\n634\n00:31:00.035 --> 00:31:04.465\nAnd if we go in to our web browser,\nwhat I did is I pulled up some websites so\n\n635\n00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:06.375\nto help us just to\nunderstand how to do this.\n\n636\n00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:08.855\nAgain, all the URLs are in\nthe show notes for you.\n\n637\n00:31:08.855 --> 00:31:12.265\nDepending on the version of Windows you\nrun, you have to look in different places.\n\n638\n00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:15.695\nThe index dot dat file was\nused up through Windows 7.\n\n639\n00:31:15.695 --> 00:31:19.280\nWindows 8 and Windows 10 change\nthe way IE stores this data.\n\n640\n00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.880\nIt's not longer in an indexed .DAT file,\nit's now stored in a different format so\n\n641\n00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.970\nwe have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n642\n00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.750\nSo IE history or IE explorer history\nformat, this particular wiki,\n\n643\n00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.390\nthe forensics wiki is very good.\n\n644\n00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:37.260\nTalks about every IE version up\nthrough the end of Windows 7 which\n\n645\n00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.440\nwould be IE 9, right?\n\n646\n00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.968\nAnd then shows us how all of this\nis set up, how it's broken down and\n\n647\n00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:46.496\nshows you how to read this information,\nso this will be helpful for\n\n648\n00:31:46.496 --> 00:31:49.146\nyou if you have to go in and\nlook at older versions.\n\n649\n00:31:49.146 --> 00:31:52.947\nIf you wanna see what the newer file\nprocess looks like in Windows 8 and\n\n650\n00:31:52.947 --> 00:31:55.860\nWindows 10,\nGot a little reference for you there.\n\n651\n00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.571\nWe now are gonna be using,\ninstead of the older version,\n\n652\n00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:02.356\nwe've got the WebCacheV01.dat file,\n\n653\n00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:07.090\nwhich is now going to be located in\na different location on Windows 10.\n\n654\n00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.813\nSo we can take this path right here,\nif I can get to that right here,\n\n655\n00:32:12.813 --> 00:32:18.250\nand we could go to Windows 10 and\nwe could take a look for that.\n\n656\n00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.387\nSo let's go in, and let's actually\nsee if we can make some magic happen,\n\n657\n00:32:22.387 --> 00:32:23.980\nas they say.\n\n658\n00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.371\nAnd if we go in here and\ngo to the C drive.\n\n659\n00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:36.557\nAnd go there, hold on one second.\n\n660\n00:32:36.557 --> 00:32:39.875\nSee, that coz I didn't put\nin the user name, silly me.\n\n661\n00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:45.010\n[LAUGH] All right so, we just need to\ndo the following, give me one second.\n\n662\n00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:45.688\nLet me find out.\n\n663\n00:32:47.747 --> 00:32:52.373\nIt can logged on as nate, I just wanna\nget the user name coz you never know.\n\n664\n00:32:52.373 --> 00:32:55.510\nAll right, cuz somebody could have\ncome along while I wasn't looking so\n\n665\n00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.470\nI'm just gonna put the user name in there.\n\n666\n00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.930\n&gt;&gt; And now when you do bad things and\nthe forensic investigator comes in,\n\n667\n00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.090\nthey think it's Nate that did it.\n\n668\n00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n669\n00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's why we do that.\n\n670\n00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n671\n00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.247\n&gt;&gt; So, WebCache.\n\n672\n00:33:05.247 --> 00:33:06.303\nWhat do you mean you can't try.\n\n673\n00:33:06.303 --> 00:33:07.423\nYou can't find it, why not.\n\n674\n00:33:07.423 --> 00:33:09.087\nI know why, it's probably hidden.\n\n675\n00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:12.536\nBecause I didn't actually take that,\nand yeah let's go in and\n\n676\n00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:15.800\nlet's actually see if we can find that for\njust one second.\n\n677\n00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.420\nSo If we go into the C drive and\nwhat we have to do is go in.\n\n678\n00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.230\nAm I in as Nate?\n\n679\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.500\nI should be in as Nate.\n\n680\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.530\nThat's why I don't have administrative\nrates underneath his profile.\n\n681\n00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:27.870\nThat's why.\n\n682\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.750\nThat's why it's not gonna let me in.\n\n683\n00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.050\nSo you notice,\nsee I love Windows 10, right?\n\n684\n00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.157\nSo realtime demonstration\nof ridiculousness, right?\n\n685\n00:33:34.157 --> 00:33:36.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm in here, right?\n\n686\n00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.030\nAnd it says okay, click Continue.\n\n687\n00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.450\nYou probably get access to this folder.\n\n688\n00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.400\nIt's still trying to work its way through,\nit hasn't given me access yet.\n\n689\n00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.360\nSo I'm going in, and I keep clicking\nContinue and it won't let me in.\n\n690\n00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.140\nI forgot the Nate's username doesn't have,\nhis log on doesn't have admin rights.\n\n691\n00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.830\nSo, I would normally be able to go in.\n\n692\n00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.960\nThat is the path by the way.\n\n693\n00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.850\nThat will work.\n\n694\n00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.740\nBut the account I'm logged\nin under the local machine,\n\n695\n00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.620\ndoesn't have full admin rights, that's\nwhy I can't get into actual profile.\n\n696\n00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.810\nIf I could, yeah, so if I could,\nthen I would be able to go in and\n\n697\n00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.180\nI'd be able to expose that\ngoing through and essential.\n\n698\n00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:05.913\nYou know what?\nI could probably,\n\n699\n00:34:05.913 --> 00:34:06.584\nlet me see if I can do it this way.\n\n700\n00:34:06.584 --> 00:34:07.458\nHold on one second.\n\n701\n00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:10.237\nI forgot we have two on here and\nif I do host,\n\n702\n00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:14.583\nlet me see if it'll let me do host for\napp data instead of username.\n\n703\n00:34:17.527 --> 00:34:18.805\nThere we go, okay yeah.\n\n704\n00:34:18.805 --> 00:34:21.775\nSo the host user I have rights\nbecause it's not gonna block me.\n\n705\n00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:25.965\nSo when I go in to the other user,\nthe host user, in this path right here.\n\n706\n00:34:25.965 --> 00:34:32.820\nYou'll see the WebCacheV01.dat file,\nthat's what replaces the IE cache.\n\n707\n00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.940\nThe index.dat file up through Windows 7.\n\n708\n00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.390\nIt's now gonna be this WebCacheV1 or\nV01.dat file.\n\n709\n00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:42.560\nThat's what we would go after\nto bring up the cache and\n\n710\n00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.010\nto see all the information\nin the newer versions of IE.\n\n711\n00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.120\nSo again we'd wanna grab that.\n\n712\n00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.180\nNow is all that stuff going to be part\nof a forensically sound bitstream copy?\n\n713\n00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.660\nAbsolutely.\nCuz again it's not volatile data,\n\n714\n00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.840\nit's sitting in the hard drive,\nwe would just have to know to look for\n\n715\n00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.160\nthese different file types in these\ndifferent locations based on the version\n\n716\n00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.095\nof the browser that we have because\nthey're stored in different locations.\n\n717\n00:35:03.095 --> 00:35:05.853\nSo we would have to be aware of that and\nobviously know that,\n\n718\n00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.903\notherwise we would have a problem, right.\n\n719\n00:35:07.903 --> 00:35:11.560\nBut once you know that it's not\ntoo hard to go in and find it.\n\n720\n00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.645\nAnd we just have to know where to look,\nessentially, right.\n\n721\n00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.080\nAnd then we have tools\nthat'll bring that up.\n\n722\n00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.100\nI'm gonna show you a cache viewer\nin one of the upcoming episodes.\n\n723\n00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.179\nWe'll take a look at how to actually look\nat the information that's in those filles.\n\n724\n00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:23.055\nAnd not only that but\nI'll still look into the red stream and\n\n725\n00:35:23.055 --> 00:35:24.827\nsee other stuff that's in there as well.\n\n726\n00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:28.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's interesting to me about\nthis is that the same tickle spot that\n\n727\n00:35:28.415 --> 00:35:32.045\nhackers might have would probably be\nthe same one that someone that wants\n\n728\n00:35:32.045 --> 00:35:35.937\nto get into the [INAUDIBLE] it's all\nabout collecting information and\n\n729\n00:35:35.937 --> 00:35:41.067\ntrying to find the in or trying to find,\nobviously for an investigator,\n\n730\n00:35:41.067 --> 00:35:42.947\nit's a who done it, who did this.\n\n731\n00:35:42.947 --> 00:35:49.140\nI got to take all this information which\ncould seemingly be very, very innocuous.\n\n732\n00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.390\nBut it will lead-\n&gt;&gt; Very innocuous.\n\n733\n00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To where we're trying to go.\n\n734\n00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:58.610\nThis might be the key piece of evidence\nthat I need to actually find out what has\n\n735\n00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.325\noccurred, and who did this, and ultimately\nlead us to our path for that truth.\n\n736\n00:36:03.325 --> 00:36:06.545\nThat being said, the truth is is that\nwe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n737\n00:36:06.545 --> 00:36:09.875\n[LAUGH] And we have plenty more\nto go on Windows Forensics.\n\n738\n00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:11.435\nSo hopefully we'll see you there.\n\n739\n00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:13.365\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n740\n00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:16.215\nFor IT Pro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n741\n00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:17.545\n&gt;&gt; I'm index.dat file.\n\n742\n00:36:17.545 -->

00:00:16.440\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV!\n\n7\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.210\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n8\n00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.270\nyour today's episode we are moving\non with more on CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.950\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio again\n\n10\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.290\nto lend his expertise on that very topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.440\nAdam, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.410\n&gt;&gt; I lend nothing.\n\n13\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.903\n&gt;&gt; Or you get nothing.\n\n15\n00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:36.070\nDiscount supply, but\nyou get nothing for

00:00:42.140\nGood day to everybody, wherever you are.\n\n19\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.715\nHopefully, it is a better weather day for\nyou than it has been [LAUGH] here for us,\n\n20\n00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.940\na spot of rain late in the year.\n\n21\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.810\nSo we look forward to\nspending some time today\n\n22\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.830\ntalking about continue to talk about.\n\n23\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Continuing.\n&gt;&gt; Continuing to talk\n\n24\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.560\nabout all the cool stuff we\ncan do with Windows forensics.\n\n25\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.700\nWe've been talking about demoing and\n\n26\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.310\ndiscussing with you a lot of the tools,\ntechniques, things we can use and or\n\n27\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.790\ninteract with, around the Windows\nenvironment, there are so many options.\n\n28\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.540\nIt is a embarrassment of riches one would\nsay, with regards to forensic's tools.\n\n29\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.320\nAnd yet surprisingly we struggle to figure\nout how to find data in systems sometimes,\n\n30\n00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110\nnot I think because we don't have options,\nas we've clearly shown you,\n\n31\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320\nwe're gonna continue show\nyou here in a few minutes.\n\n32\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.580\nThere are many, many tools, but\nI think because unfortunately\n\n33\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.740\nas we've pointed out a lot of times first\nresponders are not trained properly.\n\n34\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.000\nThey don't understand the methodology,\nthe mechanism, the tools, the techniques.\n\n35\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.140\nThey're not sure what tool to use and\nor what tools should be appropriate and\n\n36\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.030\nwould be beneficial in a given situation.\n\n37\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.660\nOr, they try whatever tool it is, but\n\n38\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.910\nthey may do so or use it in a way\nthat will not be appropriate and is,\n\n39\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.700\nas a result, not gonna produce\nforensically sound evidence.\n\n40\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.540\nAnd so this is probably\nthe biggest challenge we have.\n\n41\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.025\nNot that we don't have the tools, but\nrather the awareness, the training,\n\n42\n00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.555\nthe knowledge, the focus of those tools.\n\n43\n00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.245\nUnderstanding how they're deployed,\nhow to use them.\n\n44\n00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:07.805\nIt may be a challenge.\n\n45\n00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:11.665\nWe talk in general in information\nsecurity about security awareness and\n\n46\n00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:15.465\nthe value, the need,\nthe importance of it in any environment.\n\n47\n00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:18.675\nIt's probably the biggest challenge we\nhave, but also the biggest opportunity\n\n48\n00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:23.320\narea for us to improve overall how\nsecurity is going to be carried out.\n\n49\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.400\nAnd is really a focus of everybody\ninvolved top to bottom in\n\n50\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.600\nthe organization.\n\n51\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.730\nThis is no exception,\n\n52\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.120\nI'm not suggesting that everybody should\nbe trained as a CHFI professional.\n\n53\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.400\nI'm not suggesting that everybody who\npotentially could be a first responder\n\n54\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.010\nshould know how to use a set of tools, but\nwhat I am suggesting is that everybody who\n\n55\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.590\ncould be a first responder should be\ntrained on three or four basic concepts of\n\n56\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.415\nwhat not to do and perhaps with what to do\nwith regards to being a first responder.\n\n57\n00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:54.655\nAnd we've talked about this before.\n\n58\n00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:57.075\nShow up,\nfigure out that something has happened.\n\n59\n00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.245\nAre you gonna be the one\nthat goes in the room and\n\n60\n00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.035\nmoves everything around looking for\nevidence?\n\n61\n00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:05.405\nOr are you gonna be the one that's simply\ngonna acknowledge there's an issue,\n\n62\n00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:09.515\nsecure the scene and wait for\na more qualified team of incident response\n\n63\n00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.700\nprofessionals to show up and\nto take charge, right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.990\nAnd that's the kind of\nthing that as a CHFI,\n\n65\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.550\nyou really need to think about, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.580\nUltimately if you do get certified as a\nCHFI and even if you don't, if you simply\n\n67\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.800\nare an information security professional\nthat dabbles in forensics on occasion.\n\n68\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.910\nBecause you have an interest in it and\n\n69\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.950\nthere's absolutely nothing\nwrong with that, by the way.\n\n70\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.310\nThat's great because it's a way for you to\nexpand your knowledge, in theory, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.650\nLearn more about the kind of things that\nwe do potentially on a regular basis.\n\n72\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.820\nPerhaps be of added value and help to\nthe professionals that are gonna pursue it\n\n73\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.060\nformally and make that something\nthey do on a regular basis.\n\n74\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.830\nAnd learning on the job is\na great way to acquire skills.\n\n75\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.730\nBut the challenge ultimately is,\n\n76\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.550\nthat we still need to figure out what\nhappens when something goes wrong, right?\n\n77\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.460\nWho's gonna be on the point of the spear,\nas we say?\n\n78\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.790\nAnd those people are the people that need\nto have at least the basic knowledge,\n\n79\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.110\nthe basic training to understand how to\nidentify a problem, identify a situation.\n\n80\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.930\nWe refer to that as situational awareness,\ntraditionally.\n\n81\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.210\nAnd with situational awareness\ncomes responsibility.\n\n82\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.070\nAnd so whether you're formally certified,\nyou're informally interested in\n\n83\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.150\nthe knowledge, or anything in\nbetween on the bell curve, right?\n\n84\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Along that median somewhere\n\n85\n00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.747\nwhere you're moving from being\ninterested towards, ultimately,\n\n86\n00:04:26.747 --> 00:04:28.420\ncertification over time.\n\n87\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.730\nAnd all of the points on that map\nare equally important to an organization.\n\n88\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.140\nBut somebody,\nespecially somebody who's certified,\n\n89\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.230\nhas to take responsibility,\ntake the lead, and explain, show, and\n\n90\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.460\neducate for everybody in the organization\nas to what the responsibilities,\n\n91\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.110\nthe formality, and\nthe specificity of response looks like.\n\n92\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.060\nYeah, whether that's part of a broader\nsecurity awareness, campaign,\n\n93\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.100\nmaybe you run a lunch and learn,\nyou run a newsletter every other month.\n\n94\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.320\nYou put out some tips,\n\n95\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.110\nmaybe it's something that's built into\nthe overall security awareness program.\n\n96\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.798\nWhere people are given a little bit of\nknowledge about what to do if they uncover\n\n97\n00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:10.070\nsome sort of activity that they\nthink may not be appropriate.\n\n98\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.791\nHere's the three step process that as\nan organization we want you to follow.\n\n99\n00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.550\nSee something, say something, right?\n\n100\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.300\nFor instance, that kind of a campaign,\nwhere if somebody sees something,\n\n101\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.670\nthey're told what to do and how to do it.\n\n102\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.890\nIt's not that we expect them to go\nrun a tool and recover a drive image.\n\n103\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.540\nWe just want them to ensure that they\nnotify the right authority or the right\n\n104\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.140\nperson and that they get out of the way\nand make sure that nothing else happens.\n\n105\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.910\nAnd if we could just get them to\nthat point, them being everybody in\n\n106\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.150\nthe organization, if we can get everybody\nin the organization to the point whether\n\n107\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.190\nthey're aware of that simple three,\ntwo, four steps process whatever it is,\n\n108\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.800\nwe've done it tremendous\nservice to the organization.\n\n109\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.550\nUltimately we made a tremendous\nimpact with regards to our ability to\n\n110\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.320\nforensically, soundly thru forensic\nprocess respond to an incident.\n\n111\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.625\nRemember many incidence and\n\n112\n00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:02.140\nwe've been talking generically about hey\nthis is gonna happen let's go look at this\n\n113\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.898\ndata, this stuff is in this\nplace that kind of thing.\n\n114\n00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:10.310\nBut many incidents occur because somebody\nin the organization goes out and\n\n115\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.510\ndoes something that they normally do but\nperhaps has a different outcome.\n\n116\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.550\nThey use their machine and\nthey download something from the web, but\n\n117\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.290\ninstead of getting it from\na secure safe verified site,\n\n118\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.060\ninadvertently they follow a link\nthat's in a phishing email and\n\n119\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.020\nthey go out to a site or\ngo somewhere where they get malware.\n\n120\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.830\nThis kinda stuff happens all the time.\n\n121\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.820\nThis is the bread and\nbutter of what we do in forensics.\n\n122\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.460\nIt's not the sexy, cool, hey I got hacked\nby a foreign government kinda stuff.\n\n123\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.640\nIt's just the mundane, average\nblocking and tackling that goes on.\n\n124\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.170\nThe security 101 kind of stuff,\nwhere somebody gets malware,\n\n125\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.490\nsomebody goes in and\nfinds an open share on a machine, and\n\n126\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.250\nstarts snooping around and finds data\nthat they're not supposed to see.\n\n127\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.570\nYeah, you heard Daniel in prior\ndiscussions at one point,\n\n128\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.545\nrecount the fact that this had happened at\na location where he had worked in a prior\n\n129\n00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:03.920\nenvironment where you have that guy who is\nsnooping around at the managers machine or\n\n130\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.820\nwhatever it was.\n\n131\n00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.270\nAnd he was one of the professionals\nthat had to respond,\n\n132\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.370\nhad to kind of walk through and\ndeal with this, but you made the point,\n\n133\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.800\nthat it was the manager who\nnoticed something unusual, right?\n\n134\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.920\nYou said hey, the manager essentially\nthought that the mouse was moving\n\n135\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.800\nin an unusual way or\nthere was some tell tell activity, right?\n\n136\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.490\nWhatever it may have been.\n\n137\n00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.850\nIn Daniel's story it was that the mouse\nseemed to move at odd times and\n\n138\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.990\nkind of had a mind of it's\nown at certain points.\n\n139\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.100\nThat in the manager's mind became\nsomething that was unusual, and\n\n140\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.860\nunusual enough that the manager\nsaid something even though\n\n141\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.160\nthe manager may have thought,\nit's probably nothing.\n\n142\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.330\nRight?\nFor whatever reason, they said something.\n\n143\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330\nYou guys investigated and ultimately,\n\n144\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.340\nalthough you said it took\na little time and effort.\n\n145\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.890\nYou found that somebody was\nactually up to no good, right?\n\n146\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.440\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; Somebody had been using malware.\n\n147\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.260\nWas in the machine and was poking around,\ndoing stuff they weren't supposed to do.\n\n148\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.541\nThis is traditionally how\nforensic examination happens.\n\n149\n00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.023\nThis is traditionally\nthe kind of activity,\n\n150\n00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:02.219\nthe kind of story that leads up to\nthe things that we're talking about here.\n\n151\n00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:06.452\nIt could be that really cool, exciting\nstory you're gonna tell people for\n\n152\n00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.945\nyears to come, that will happen\non occasion, but the reality\n\n153\n00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:14.444\nis the majority of this stuff is just,\nhey, somebody did something silly, and\n\n154\n00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:18.960\nnow we gotta go fix the problem I mean,\nthat's traditionally what it is.\n\n155\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.798\nAnd as a result, these tools that we've\nbeen talking about, we'll continue to talk\n\n156\n00:08:22.798 --> 00:08:26.473\nabout, we're gonna take a look at some\nmore here in a minute, are very powerful,\n\n157\n00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:30.313\nvery helpful, but the reality is, we don't\nwant the average individual using these\n\n158\n00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:33.129\ntools we simple want the average\nindividual to clear the way.\n\n159\n00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:36.910\nFor a forensic response to be done\nproperly by insuring that nothing is\n\n160\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.265\nmodified when they figure out something is\nwrong, and is we could just get to that\n\n161\n00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:45.622\nlevel of awareness, if we can just ensure\nthat through awareness and training,\n\n162\n00:08:45.622 --> 00:08:50.520\neverybody in the organization, let's\nunderscore the word everybody, right?\n\n163\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.960\nEverybody in the organization,\nfrom the very top of the food chain,\n\n164\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.680\ndown to the most basic entry level\nposition, the information worker who is\n\n165\n00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.860\njust doing administrative duties, whatever\nthat may be, it's doesn't really matter.\n\n166\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.810\nEverybody's position is equally important,\nif we could train everybody, and\n\n167\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.020\njust make them aware of that,\nwhat a different world we would live in as\n\n168\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.020\na security professional and\nas a forensic investigator.\n\n169\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.400\nWe'd actually have the ability to do our\njob in way, that ultimately would allow us\n\n170\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.470\nto most likely be able to\nrespond more often than not and\n\n171\n00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.690\nfind the information we need, and\ndo so in a forensically sound way.\n\n172\n00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.870\nOr we could give up and\n\n173\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.465\ndecide we're gonna go off and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:29.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, we could do that.\n\n175\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.610\nI was thinking I'd like to do something\nwhere I don't have to sit so much.\n\n176\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.830\nI was thinking more like bake cakes.\n\n177\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.530\n&gt;&gt; That's always a nice job.\n\n178\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.652\n&gt;&gt; Cakes are tasty.\n\n180\n00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:39.670\nYeah, [LAUGH], I just,\nI thought it would be kind of cool,\n\n181\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.850\nI could wonder around when I'm not baking,\nI could coffee and\n\n182\n00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.750\nof course ultimately I get to use pots and\npans and stuff.\n\n183\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure, with your personality\nhe'd have a reality show\n\n184\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.950\ntoo much longer [LAUGH].\n\n185\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.782\n&gt;&gt; I hope not.\n\n186\n00:09:50.782 --> 00:09:52.350\n&gt;&gt; That would be funny.\n\n187\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.594\n&gt;&gt; No that would just be,\nthat's like Dante's seven levels right?\n\n188\n00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's like the sixth or\n\n189\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.680\nseventh level right there.\n\n190\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.420\n&gt;&gt; You would just kind of\nlay down at that point.\n\n191\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would be down in the depths,\nif I had to do a reality show,\n\n192\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.745\nyou don't want someone like me talking\nabout reality That's not a good thing.\n\n193\n00:10:08.745 --> 00:10:10.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just waiting too bit of\n\n194\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.810\na person to have to do that.\n\n195\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.260\nAll right so let's take a look\nat a some additional stuff,\n\n196\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.690\nnow that I'm gone my show box, and we've\nactually talked about the ridiculousness,\n\n197\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.030\nwe've got that out of the way not we can\nfocus on what we are here to talk about.\n\n198\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.550\nLet's actually take a look we\ncould go back in the machine,\n\n199\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.770\nto a little more show and\ntell so, If I told you Dan.\n\n200\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.270\nThat there was a tool,\nthere is a tool, not was a tool,\n\n201\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.090\nthere is a tool in windows.\n\n202\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.370\nThat allows us to go out and\nactually look at hardware devices hooked\n\n203\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.870\nup to the machine, and\nfind information about them.\n\n204\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.080\nWould you believe me?\n\n205\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.990\n&gt;&gt; I would believe you.\n\n206\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.620\n&gt;&gt; You would be a silly person,\n[LAUGH], but\n\n207\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.750\nyou are absolutely right to believe me.\n\n208\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.780\nThere is a tool, there are several\nways to do this by the way.\n\n209\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.870\nClearly looking at the machine,\nand the environment around,\n\n210\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.860\nit would be the one way to do it.\n\n211\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.260\nBut the challenge is, if I see\nsomething clipped up to the machine.\n\n212\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.930\nDo I really understand what it is,\nhow it's configured, information about it.\n\n213\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.240\nI know just looking at the machine now,\nthere's a mouse attached to it, right?\n\n214\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.880\nSo I've got an optical mouse,\nI see there's a lightning adaptor for\n\n215\n00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.930\nnetwork, right?\n\n216\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.600\nI had a thumb drive plugged in.\n\n217\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.890\nBut do I really understand the makeup, the\nfocus, the configuration of these devices,\n\n218\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.740\nthese peripherals.\n\n219\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.420\nThere's probably a printer, right?\n\n220\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.200\nThere could be other stuff.\n\n221\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.450\nSome of this now, these days,\nmay be done through Bluetooth or wireless.\n\n222\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.930\nSo there could be a printer\nin the other room, but\n\n223\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.190\nI may not be connected to it physically.\n\n224\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.090\nI'm connected to it over\nthe network logically, and\n\n225\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.540\nas a result I may not realize, I'm using\nthat device, this machine in other words\n\n226\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.300\nmay have access to systems that I\ndon't physically see in the room.\n\n227\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.470\nSo there are reasons why we wanna\ntake a look at this, right?\n\n228\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.780\nSo if we go in and\nagain just reminding you\n\n229\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.160\nall URLs that we're gonna be showing you,\nall reg keys, things like that.\n\n230\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.430\nAll that stuff's in the show notes,\n\n231\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.870\nDaniel's got a complete set of\nthose keeping track of them for us.\n\n232\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.570\nWe will be providing those to you.\n\n233\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.700\nEncourage you to go out, by the way,\ntake a look at these yourself.\n\n234\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.130\nDownload and use some of these tools.\n\n235\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.360\nWe're not going to demo every one of them.\n\n236\n00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.430\nA lot of them are going to be show and\ntell, like, hey you could do this.\n\n237\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.940\nBut definitely encourage you to go out and\ntake a look.\n\n238\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.970\nWindows Device Console.\n\n239\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.920\nIt's called Devcon.exe.\n\n240\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.090\nAs you can see here, this is a command\nline tool displays detailed information\n\n241\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.320\nabout devices running on your computer.\n\n242\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.270\nIt's part of what's called the WDK,\nthe Windows Driver Kit.\n\n243\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.340\nIt is specific to a version of Windows.\n\n244\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.800\nSo the thing to remember about this\nis if you're using Windows 10,\n\n245\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.720\nyou need the WDK for Windows 10.\n\n246\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.980\nRight, that kind of thing.\n\n247\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.440\nAnd obviously, if you're gonna use\nan earlier version because you're gonna\n\n248\n00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.340\ninterrogate an earlier machine,\nyou gotta download multiple versions.\n\n249\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.060\nThis goes back to that idea of, hey,\nlet's build that tool kit, right?\n\n250\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.310\nThat we talked about in prior episodes.\n\n251\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.700\nWe may need ISOs of\ndifferent operating systems,\n\n252\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.720\nto be able to forensically\nexamine a machine.\n\n253\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.180\nRight?\nIf we want to use the Dev kit for\n\n254\n00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.750\nrather the driver kit rather, for\nWindows, let's say, I don't know,\n\n255\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.810\nWindows 7, Windows Vista, whatever.\n\n256\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.580\nWe're gonna have to\nhave a version of that.\n\n257\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.310\nWe may need to actually install,\nset that up and run it to get the tool.\n\n258\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.300\nAnd we're gonna have to have,\na prior version, so when need those ISOs,\n\n259\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.340\nwhen need to have those working machines.\n\n260\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.290\nYou lot of times these days,\nwe could set these up and\n\n261\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.930\nput them on the front of workstations\nthat runs virtual machines and\n\n262\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.920\nrun them in a virtual environment,\nso we can load the tools and\n\n263\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.040\nview those things that way, and\nwe could then have them available.\n\n264\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.930\nYou could set up a machine physically.\n\n265\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.340\nYou can have an old\nschool way of doing it.\n\n266\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.310\nDo a triple boot those machine.\n\n267\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.490\nRemember set it up instead of the boot\nloader doing all that, we could do that.\n\n268\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.280\nRight?\nYou may or\n\n269\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.230\nmay not understand how to do that,\nand that's fine,\n\n270\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.690\nthat's not a skill we spend\na lot of time on these days.\n\n271\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.130\nMost people that I talk to don't really\nunderstand the concept of dual-booting\n\n272\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.100\na machine anymore.\n\n273\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.030\nBut back in the day before virtualization,\nwhere you couldn't just spin up multiple\n\n274\n00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.840\ninstances of something, you would actually\ninstall multiple operating systems on\n\n275\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.500\na physical box, you would modify the boot\nloader essentially the boot menu,\n\n276\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.350\nand you would then be able\nto boot multiple OS's.\n\n277\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.560\nIt's not a very foreign concept,\ncertainly not something very hard to do.\n\n278\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.180\nPeople that root in Jailbreak,\ntheir devices often\n\n279\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.970\nright on the mobile site will do this,\nthey can load more than one OS.\n\n280\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.700\nSo it's certainly something\nto think about, and\n\n281\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.420\nit's something you may decide to do.\n\n282\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.430\nBut the DevCon tool would allow\nus to take a look at that, and\n\n283\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.020\ndefine this kinda information.\n\n284\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.770\nSo just be aware of it.\n\n285\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.180\nIt is part ultimately of what you could\ninstall and build out as your toolkit, but\n\n286\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.670\nas I said just keep in mind device or\nrather platform specific, right?\n\n287\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.680\nSo we need the appropriate kind of\nplatform to run the appropriate tool.\n\n288\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.500\nWe just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n289\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.570\nIn addition we could take\na look at drive slack space.\n\n290\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.400\nWe talked about slack space, already.\n\n291\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.670\nThe idea of how to look at\nthe slack space on the machine.\n\n292\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.070\nIf you remember when we went through and\n\n293\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.440\ntalked about, hard disks and files\nsystems in one of our prior discussions.\n\n294\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.040\nWe spent a fair amount of time defining\nwhat a platter, what a cluster.\n\n295\n00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.400\nWhat an allocation unit was.\n\n296\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.900\nAll that kind of stuff.\n\n297\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.810\nAnd we talked about how we build out.\n\n298\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.830\nthe hard drive from kind of\nan architectural perspective.\n\n299\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.465\nWe talked about all.\n\n300\n00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:57.565\nAll the different ways we allocate space,\n\n301\n00:14:57.565 --> 00:15:00.835\nwe showed you how to calculate\ntotal space on the hard drive.\n\n302\n00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:04.225\nAnd we walk through all that,\nand as part of that we talked\n\n303\n00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:08.195\nabout the fact that if typically\n512 bytes, is gonna be the size of\n\n304\n00:15:08.195 --> 00:15:12.695\none of the little allocation units in\nthe system, in the hard drive, right?\n\n305\n00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:15.395\nAnd we say, okay,\na cluster's a group of those.\n\n306\n00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:19.525\nTypically we have, on a large hard drive,\na 4K cluster typically take\n\n307\n00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:23.450\neight of the 512 byte sectors,\nright, the individual little unit.\n\n308\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.690\nWe group them together and\nwe say okay, we got a 4K cluster.\n\n309\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.610\nThat's the group that we'll kind\nof manage and allocate with.\n\n310\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.375\nBut an individual sector\nwill be typically 512 bytes.\n\n311\n00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:38.703\nSo we made the point that if we had a\ndocument that was bigger than 512 bytes as\n\n312\n00:15:38.703 --> 00:15:42.310\nan allocation, then we would have\nto take multiple sectors, and\n\n313\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.413\nperhaps even the entire cluster,\nmultiple clusters.\n\n314\n00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:48.167\nIn order to be able to allocate space and\nso\n\n315\n00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:52.338\nif we had a document that was\nlet's keep it simple, easy math,\n\n316\n00:15:52.338 --> 00:15:58.481\nright let's say it's 512 per sector, let's\nsay our document is gonna be 800 bytes,\n\n317\n00:15:58.481 --> 00:16:02.603\nso roughly takes about a sector and\na half on average, right?\n\n318\n00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:06.324\nBut we obviously, we can't split\na sector down the middle and say okay,\n\n319\n00:16:06.324 --> 00:16:10.110\nyou're gonna take half that next sector,\nkinda bit splitting, right?\n\n320\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.800\nOr borrowing, right, when we talk\nabout allocating IP addresses.\n\n321\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.930\nWe don't do it that way, so\ninstead, we take the whole sector.\n\n322\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.980\nSo, two sectors are gonna be allocated,\n\n323\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.350\nbut half that second sector's\nessentially empty space.\n\n324\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.440\nWe're not using it.\n\n325\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.000\nBut in the hard drive,\nwe mark it as complete, right?\n\n326\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.780\nIn other words, we mark it as being used.\n\n327\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.830\nNow, unlike, let's say, in cryptography,\nwhere we do some padding on occasion\n\n328\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.260\nto fill the block up, so we can\nallocate and understand how to manage\n\n329\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.480\nin a block algorithm, where we're\nessentially working on blocks of data.\n\n330\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.610\nAnd we encrypt and\ndecrypt based on a block structure for\n\n331\n00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.420\na similar to the sector concept.\n\n332\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.394\nWe actually paved the blocks in certain\ncases, to make sure they're full,\n\n333\n00:16:49.394 --> 00:16:52.650\nbecause we don't operate on a search and\nempty half lock.\n\n334\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.960\nWe don't do that here, right?\n\n335\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.580\nThe data is what the data is.\n\n336\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:01.230\nSo, If we have 800 bytes, or\nlet's say roughly about 900 bytes,\n\n337\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.050\nso roughly about half of\nthat additional sector.\n\n338\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.550\nThe rest of it is empty, we call it slack\nspace, even though we have marked it as\n\n339\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.860\nessentially being fully\nallocated on the drive.\n\n340\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.840\nSo, how do we read the slack space,\nright, is kinda the question.\n\n341\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.720\nWell, there are many\ntools that can do this.\n\n342\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.000\nOne of the tools would be\nthis tool called DriveSpot.\n\n343\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.330\nYou can see it up here.\n\n344\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.000\nIf you remember,\nwe went in a prior episode to\n\n345\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.640\nthe digital intelligence website.\n\n346\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.610\nThis is where we had the drive copiers.\n\n347\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.480\nRemember, I showed you or\nshowed all of you.\n\n348\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.770\nI'm talking to Daniel.\n\n349\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n350\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.110\n&gt;&gt; I showed all of you, right, bad host.\n\n351\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.640\nI'm supposed to talk to the audience,\n\n352\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.110\nnot talk to my co-host.\nSo, if you remember, we showed all of you\n\n353\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.060\nthat we have these drive to drive copiers\nthat are used with right blocking,\n\n354\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.210\nand digital intelligence was one\nof the web sites we went to,\n\n355\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.774\nto look at some of their hardware.\nThey had all the different console models,\n\n356\n00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.582\nwe talked to you a little bit about them,\nthey happen to make a lot\n\n357\n00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:52.098\nof different products.\nI think we showed you some of the cables\n\n358\n00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:54.420\nthat are forensically sound for\ncopying stuff like that.\n\n359\n00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.164\nThis is a tool that they make and\nsell, it's called drive spy.\n\n360\n00:17:58.164 --> 00:18:01.701\nIt's a forensics DOS shell\nthat allows you to go in and\n\n361\n00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:05.460\ntake a look at drive recovery and\nlook at slack space.\n\n362\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.382\nYou buy it from them,\n\n363\n00:18:06.382 --> 00:18:09.208\nit's usually, I think it's about\na couple hundred dollars US.\n\n364\n00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:13.410\nIf you buy it commercially, so\nI think $250 at least out right now.\n\n365\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.418\nLaw enforcement typically gets\ndiscount for this kind of stuff,\n\n366\n00:18:16.418 --> 00:18:20.695\nyou could see they knock $50 off the price\nthere, so it's $200 for law enforcement.\n\n367\n00:18:20.695 --> 00:18:25.855\nAnd you get this tool kit with\na nifty little carrying bag.\n\n368\n00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.087\nIf I can zoom in here, you can see, right?\n\n369\n00:18:28.087 --> 00:18:31.057\nIt's got a nifty little bag\nassociated with it, cuz for $250,\n\n370\n00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:32.055\nyou want the cool bag.\n\n371\n00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:32.885\n&gt;&gt; I sure as heck do.\n\n372\n00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:34.125\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what you want.\n\n373\n00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:37.725\nAnd so, you get that, and you can\nthen use this, you load this up and\n\n374\n00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:41.125\nyou're able to use this to actually\nlook at slack space on the drive.\n\n375\n00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:43.515\nSo, this is how we can\nfind where empty space is.\n\n376\n00:18:43.515 --> 00:18:46.400\nNow, slack space,\nyou remember can be used to hide data.\n\n377\n00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.042\nAnd so, it's not that we just wanna go and\nsay, look,\n\n378\n00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:53.025\nthey only saved half that sector's worth\nof data, there's nothing there, right?\n\n379\n00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:54.965\nWhat we wanna do is look at that and\nsay, look,\n\n380\n00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:57.540\nthere's a half a sector worth\nof drive space that's slack.\n\n381\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.090\nBut is there something in there, right?\n\n382\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.710\nAnd if there is, hey,\nlet's figure out what it is.\n\n383\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.400\nAnd let's go see, because maybe somebody\nput something in there that they\n\n384\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.120\ndon't want us to see, right?\n\n385\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.120\nThat's really why a tool\nlike this is used.\n\n386\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.850\nSo, I want to make sure we're familiar\nwith the fact that we have tools\n\n387\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.660\nlike this.\n\n388\n00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.921\nObviously, very important for\n\n389\n00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:18.371\nus to be aware of slack space\nwhen we talk about steganography.\n\n390\n00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:22.281\nThis is one of the places where can\nessentially put data into the slack spaces\n\n391\n00:19:22.281 --> 00:19:26.500\non the drive, and we can repurpose,\nessentially, and reallocate that data.\n\n392\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.680\nSo, it's important for\n\n393\n00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.870\nus to be aware of the fact it exists,\nwe've talked about virtual memory.\n\n394\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.420\nI've shown you several different\nways to deal with memory.\n\n395\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.900\nWe can go in and use a program or\nset of tools like X-Ways here,\n\n396\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.410\nthe Forensics Software Company.\n\n397\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.820\nThey've got a working environment\ntool that allows you to go in and\n\n398\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.998\nto download and dump the memory, and all\nthe different components of the system.\n\n399\n00:19:50.998 --> 00:19:54.940\nSo, again, just software that can\nbe used by the forensics expert, by\n\n400\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.460\nthe investigator, to be able to accomplish\nsome of the things we're looking at.\n\n401\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.350\nGranted, some of these products\nwe're showing you right now,\n\n402\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.680\nare things you have to buy.\n\n403\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.500\nOften, I stress the fact\nthat a lot of times,\n\n404\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.172\nthere are free tools that will do this.\n\n405\n00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:08.230\nI'm gonna show you some free\ntools that do the same thing.\n\n406\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.910\nWe've shown you a bunch already.\n\n407\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.910\nSys internals,\nthe entire suite of tools there for\n\n408\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.470\nWindows, has tools that\ndo this kind of stuff.\n\n409\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.940\nThey have a virtual memory mapper,\n\n410\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.020\nand a raw memory mapper that\nare available that you can use.\n\n411\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.620\nIt's just another way of going about this.\n\n412\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.150\nBut you'll see this runs on any\nversion of Windows, 32 and 64 bit.\n\n413\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:31.700\nIt allows you to go in, and to take a look\nat a whole bunch of different stuff.\n\n414\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.740\nYou can go in and\ngrab the memory on the system.\n\n415\n00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.540\nYou can go in and grab, and just kinda\ncome down and show you what it does here.\n\n416\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.740\nI'll zoom in real quick.\n\n417\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.740\nJust give you a sense, you can go in and\ndo disk cloning and imaging.\n\n418\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:50.400\nYou can read partitions and file systems\nfrom dd image files, ISOs, VHD, VMDKs.\n\n419\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.200\nSo, you can read and\nmount any kind of image.\n\n420\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.330\nYou can go in and do access to drives,\n\n421\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.590\nincluding RAID images,\nterabytes of data can be allocated.\n\n422\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.780\nYou can build, or\nrather have built an interpretation for\n\n423\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.430\nall sorts of data coming off.\n\n424\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.850\nThe RAID array, excuse me.\n\n425\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:12.470\nWe support FAT, NTFS, and\nEXT file systems along with UDF, HFS, etc.\n\n426\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.210\nSo, every kind of file system\npretty much we've talked about\n\n427\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.010\nis supported by a tool like this.\n\n428\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.810\nYou can go in, and you can use\na variety of different techniques for\n\n429\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.830\nrecovering data including file carving,\ncarving files out of the system and\n\n430\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.350\nexamining them individually.\n\n431\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.020\nThere's all sorts of stuff, including,\nif you'll notice, down here,\n\n432\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.280\nI know it's kinda hard, because my\npicture is sitting over the top of it,\n\n433\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.590\nthere we we go, right there, thank you,\n\n434\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.050\nsir, you'll see we also have access to\nAlternate Data Stream verification.\n\n435\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.080\nSo, we can, as we've shown you,\none of the prior discussions.\n\n436\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.600\nI'll be able to look for\nADSs in real time using the tool,\n\n437\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.640\nwe don't have to go use a separate tool,\nwe've got hash calculators in here.\n\n438\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.570\nAll sorts of stuff in a tool like this,\nright?\n\n439\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.320\n&gt;&gt; One stop shopping, right?\n\n440\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.735\n&gt;&gt; One stop shopping.\n\n441\n00:21:52.735 --> 00:21:54.665\nIf I am gonna go out and\nbuy a tool, right?\n\n442\n00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:56.795\nOr if my customers are gonna go out and\nbuy a tool, I should say,\n\n443\n00:21:56.795 --> 00:21:58.330\ncuz normally they're gonna pay for\nit, right?\n\n444\n00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Momma didn't raise no fools, right?\n\n445\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, she did not.\n\n446\n00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:04.535\n&gt;&gt; But if I am gonna go out and spend\nmoney on a tool, or, all kidding aside,\n\n447\n00:22:04.535 --> 00:22:06.090\nrecommend a customer do that.\n\n448\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.310\nBecause they're gonna need to\nuse that tool for recovery,\n\n449\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.250\ndo I want to get a tool that's gonna\ndo multiple things to Daniel's point?\n\n450\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.360\nI want the Swiss Army knife essentially,\nright, or the McGyver of tools.\n\n451\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.240\nI don't know if you were ever,\nas I stumble over my words.\n\n452\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.234\nYou ever watch McGyver\nthe original series?\n\n453\n00:22:21.234 --> 00:22:22.105\n&gt;&gt; I was a huge McGyver fan growing up.\n\n454\n00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:24.025\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen the fact\nthat they've brought it back?\n\n455\n00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:24.941\n&gt;&gt; I hear that they were bringing it back,\nbut I haven't seen it yet.\n\n456\n00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:27.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not so.\n\n457\n00:22:27.572 --> 00:22:30.760\nWe talked about the whole retread thing,\nand how it doesn't work out well.\n\n458\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.220\nNot, I saw the first couple of episodes,\nit was not a pleasant experience.\n\n459\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.127\n&gt;&gt; You just can't bring back the magic.\n\n460\n00:22:37.127 --> 00:22:37.890\nDo something new.\n\n461\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.560\n&gt;&gt; It's just one of those things,\nI mean, they made it, it was awesome.\n\n462\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.470\nIt was great.\n\n463\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Great concept, but the reality is,\njust like anything else,\n\n464\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.790\nif you can't come up with a better idea,\nsometimes it better not to do anything.\n\n465\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but then again,\n\n466\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.450\nwe would never have TV programs\nthese days, if that was the case.\n\n467\n00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because nobody would\n\n468\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.080\nbe able to do anything,\nit just wouldn't work out anymore.\n\n469\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.600\nSo, tools like this,\nobviously, very important for\n\n470\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.150\nus to think about and consider.\n\n471\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.880\nSo, just wanted to show you some of\nthese that you can potentially inquire.\n\n472\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.440\nLet's go back,\nI wanted to show you so more stuff.\n\n473\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.370\nSpeaking of virtual memory,\nspeaking of being able to go in and\n\n474\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.070\nusing a tool that does a bunch of stuff,\nwhat about build in tools?\n\n475\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.840\nRight, we've been talking about this,\nspending some time with you\n\n476\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.090\non the value of the registry, and\ntalking a look at what's in the registry.\n\n477\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.970\nWanna go back into the registry here,\n\n478\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.820\nshow you another take on\na key that may be valuable.\n\n479\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.670\nThis time, it's gonna be where\nwhere is my swap file, right?\n\n480\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.000\nYou remember Where's Waldo?\n\n481\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.610\nSo, where's my swap file?\n\n482\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.630\nSo often times, and we've talked\nabout this, right, the paging file,\n\n483\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.350\nand the system's gonna\nhave valuable information.\n\n484\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:38.250\nThis is where we put information in memory\ninto the hard drive riding up there\n\n485\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.520\nto use as an extension of\nthe physical memory in the system.\n\n486\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.860\nThat is volatile data.\n\n487\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.350\nWe shut the machine off,\nthat data goes away.\n\n488\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.687\nWe gotta capture that information,\nbut we gotta know where it is.\n\n489\n00:23:48.687 --> 00:23:52.388\nNow, there's more than one way to find out\nwhere the swap file is, but the point is,\n\n490\n00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:54.958\nyou can go into the registry and\nget a record of where it is.\n\n491\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:58.870\nThere's a key that will tell you\nwhere this is, as we often do.\n\n492\n00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.197\nLet's just zoom in,\nlet you see where that is there.\n\n493\n00:24:02.197 --> 00:24:04.380\nCan we go full screen just so\nthey can see the path on the bottom?\n\n494\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.986\nThere we go.\n\n495\n00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:09.268\nYou'll see we are in the\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Curren-\n\n496\n00:24:09.268 --> 00:24:13.000\ntControlSet\\Control\\Session\nManager\\Memory Management.\n\n497\n00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.329\nAgain, we're gonna have all\nthese reg keys for you.\n\n498\n00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:17.860\nRight, you're gonna be able to\nfind them in the show notes.\n\n499\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.099\nBut when we go into Memory Management,\nand we come over here.\n\n500\n00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:22.810\nLet's just come over here up to the top.\n\n501\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.930\nYou can see it while I'm zoomed in.\n\n502\n00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.070\nYou'll see we have ExistingPageFiles.\n\n503\n00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.240\nAnd you'll see the path right there,\npagefile.sys, right?\n\n504\n00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.820\nSo it's in the C drive I should say,\npagefile.sys,\n\n505\n00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.900\nwhich traditionally is where\nit would be in Windows.\n\n506\n00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.175\nBut could we modify that path?\n\n507\n00:24:35.175 --> 00:24:36.800\nCould we put it somewhere else?\n\n508\n00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.940\nAbsolutely, is there\nthe possibility that malware could\n\n509\n00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.240\nhave modified this system variable\nas an environmental variable?\n\n510\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.820\nAbsolutely, right, a lot of times\nwe're verifying some of this.\n\n511\n00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.099\nNot so much because we don't know where it\nis, but because we want to know whether or\n\n512\n00:24:51.099 --> 00:24:53.561\nnot everything is the way it should be,\nright?\n\n513\n00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:55.360\nAnd that's really important as well.\n\n514\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.942\nSo we can go ahead and\nlook at this, and see whether or\n\n515\n00:24:57.942 --> 00:24:59.780\nnot the stuff is where it needs to be.\n\n516\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.240\nNow, we wanna capture what's there,\n\n517\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.982\nlet's take a look at the tool\nthat lets us do this.\n\n518\n00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:09.148\nSo we've taken a look at or\ntalked about the fact, I'm just going to\n\n519\n00:25:09.148 --> 00:25:14.242\ngo in here to SI real quick,\nto our System Internals sets of tools.\n\n520\n00:25:14.242 --> 00:25:17.560\nAnd we talk about where you can get\nthese and downloading them of course.\n\n521\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.630\nThere are a couple of tools in here,\none of them is called RAMMap.\n\n522\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.650\nRAMMap is just one of the tools that is\navailable, you could see it right there,\n\n523\n00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.759\nthere's one for virtual memory as well.\n\n524\n00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:32.710\nSo we can download and interact with and\nsee the memory map that is in the system.\n\n525\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.582\nAnd again,\nall we're gonna do is just go in.\n\n526\n00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:35.577\nThis is a graphical tool,\n\n527\n00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.806\na lot of the ones we've been\ndoing are commandline tools.\n\n528\n00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:40.396\nWe're gonna right-click,\nrun this one as Administrator,\n\n529\n00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:42.499\nmake sure that we just\nhave rights to everything.\n\n530\n00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:46.661\nBut we'll bring this tool up and\nthis looks suspiciously like, and\n\n531\n00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:50.687\nit's built on the same general\nconcept of Task Manager, right?\n\n532\n00:25:50.687 --> 00:25:54.994\nIf you look at the general look and\nfeel of this tool on the top, right,\n\n533\n00:25:54.994 --> 00:25:58.430\nwe've got Use Counts,\nProcesses, Summary, right?\n\n534\n00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.960\nSo some of that stuff looks very similar\nto what we would see in the look and\n\n535\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.550\nfeel there is similar to what\nwe would see in Task Manager.\n\n536\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.320\nBut clearly we're seeing other stuff.\n\n537\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.178\nWe're seeing Physical Pages, Physical\nRanges, File Summary, File Details.\n\n538\n00:26:10.178 --> 00:26:13.167\nWe're seeing a lot of additional stuff\nabout memory that we don't get in\n\n539\n00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:15.220\nTask Manager, as we've taken a look at.\n\n540\n00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.230\nSo we've got information here,\nlet's just go in and take a look.\n\n541\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.780\nOur Processes area, you will see does\npretty much look like Task Manager.\n\n542\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.470\nThere's our processes or PIDs,\nthe amount of memory that are being used.\n\n543\n00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.280\nWe could track a process that way.\n\n544\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.390\nWe have got priority information in\nterms of just an overview summary of\n\n545\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.510\nmemory usage.\n\n546\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.530\nWe've got physical pages,\nthis becomes important to us forensically.\n\n547\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.950\nBecause this allows us to be able to take\na look at the actual amount of memory\n\n548\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.160\nthat's allocated,\nphysical addresses that are allocated for\n\n549\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.330\nthe memory in the extreme\nleft-hand column.\n\n550\n00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.989\nThis is the walk-through of\nthe memory map that actually shows\n\n551\n00:26:52.989 --> 00:26:55.897\nus the memory locations for\nall the active pages.\n\n552\n00:26:55.897 --> 00:26:59.760\nAnd the standby information\nthat is being mapped as well.\n\n553\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.650\nWe could then use hex editors to go in and\nactually pull out information and\n\n554\n00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.710\ncross reference it to see what's there.\n\n555\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.990\nWe could look at the physical\nranges of allocated memory.\n\n556\n00:27:10.376 --> 00:27:14.980\nWe could see a File Summary, shows us all\nthe information that's currently in use,\n\n557\n00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.880\nthe path, and\nthe amount of memory each file is using.\n\n558\n00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.040\nAgain, would this be important for\na forensic investigator to have?\n\n559\n00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.350\nWe see all the DLLs, all the files,\nwhat they're consuming, right?\n\n560\n00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.067\nHow big they are, in the case of\nchrome.txt, that's a file that I created\n\n561\n00:27:29.067 --> 00:27:32.495\nas a memory dump of one of the processes,\nusing a tool called PMDump.\n\n562\n00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:33.804\nWe're gonna take a look\nat that in a minute.\n\n563\n00:27:33.804 --> 00:27:36.260\nRight, so all of this is available to me.\n\n564\n00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.680\nI can see any of this stuff and\nI can look at File Details,\n\n565\n00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.790\nthis is kind of the cool part,\nI can go in, let's say, down here.\n\n566\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.200\nAnd when I open up, now let me just do\nthis first, I'll zoom in real quick and\n\n567\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.650\njust show you what's there.\n\n568\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.190\nSo I've got the files from\nthe File Summary area, I can now go in and\n\n569\n00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.310\ndrill down into each one of the files.\n\n570\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.040\nI see the amount of memory they're using.\n\n571\n00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.790\nYou see the little plus sign there.\n\n572\n00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.191\nI open it up and I can actually see,\nright, the amount of memory,\n\n573\n00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:08.592\nthe physical address and\nthe type of memory that's being used and\n\n574\n00:28:08.592 --> 00:28:13.333\nwhere it's allocated, sector by\nsector essentially in the memory.\n\n575\n00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:17.542\nLooking at the memory map, going\nthrough each memory spot, I can see for\n\n576\n00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:18.922\neach memory location,\n\n577\n00:28:18.922 --> 00:28:23.630\nI can see a detailed map of every item in\nmemory in terms of just what is allocated.\n\n578\n00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.360\nNot the actual bits of\ninformation sitting in memory,\n\n579\n00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.960\nthat's gonna require a different tool.\n\n580\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.103\nBut I've got the map, the layout\nessentially, the treasure map, right,\n\n581\n00:28:32.103 --> 00:28:33.086\nthat lays it out.\n\n582\n00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:37.467\nIt says, okay, from this sector of memory,\nright up here, to this area down here,\n\n583\n00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:38.560\nthis block.\n\n584\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.100\nAll this is allocated to\nthis process right here.\n\n585\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.780\nAnd here's the actual memory sector\naddresses that are being used.\n\n586\n00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.130\nAnd so I can drill in and\nsee all of that using this tool.\n\n587\n00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.290\nAgain, free tool,\nget it from the Sysinternals,\n\n588\n00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.850\nWin Internal site at Microsoft Detect Net.\n\n589\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.778\nAll you got to do is be able to go out and\ndownload it, right?\n\n590\n00:28:55.778 --> 00:29:01.330\nThis is the actual dump of memory, of RAM,\nso, the physical memory in the box.\n\n591\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.690\nWhat about the ability\nto be able to go and\n\n592\n00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.200\ndo the same thing with virtual memory,\nright?\n\n593\n00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.250\nThis is where the page\nfile stuff comes in.\n\n594\n00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.385\nSo, let's go down here.\n\n595\n00:29:10.385 --> 00:29:13.870\nWe've got a similar tool called\nVMMap right here, right?\n\n596\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.040\nNow, with these tools by the way,\nI'll just zoom in so you can see.\n\n597\n00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.090\nThere is a help file associated with it.\n\n598\n00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.870\nYou could see the CHM file\nright above it there.\n\n599\n00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.650\nAnd you can parse the help file,\neither read it online.\n\n600\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.690\nOr you can just do vmmap.exe and forward\nslash question mark, if there are switches\n\n601\n00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.560\nyou'll be able to see them, but\nyou can take a look at the help file.\n\n602\n00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.300\nIn an executable like this,\nit's not so much about the switches.\n\n603\n00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.780\nIt's about hey, what can I do in the tool\nand what memory options are available?\n\n604\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.340\nSo you probably want to read that\nhelp file, right, is my point.\n\n605\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.030\nBecause that's gonna help you to\nunderstand what's going on in there.\n\n606\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.410\nSo let's just take a look at this one,\nas well.\n\n607\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.260\nNow this one I have demoed before.\n\n608\n00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.230\nThis one says, hey what process do\nyou actually wanna look at, right?\n\n609\n00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.564\nSo we're gonna dump the virtual memory,\nthe actual memory that's running and\n\n610\n00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:56.129\nbeing used for the process.\n\n611\n00:29:56.129 --> 00:30:00.229\nSo it gives me a list of processes and\nyou can see we're just scrolling down,\n\n612\n00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:01.780\nall my processes are there.\n\n613\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.560\nWe'll just zoom in so\nyou can kind of see them.\n\n614\n00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.430\nThere's the list of all the things that\nare currently running on the machine.\n\n615\n00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.080\nSo if I wanted to get a sense of\nthe processes that are active and\n\n616\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.560\nwhat kind of memory is going on,\nI can take a look.\n\n617\n00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.610\nNow often times we get a lot of\nthese SVC host processes, right?\n\n618\n00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.900\nWe see a whole bunch of them.\n\n619\n00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.998\nWe don't always really know\nwhat they're doing, right?\n\n620\n00:30:20.998 --> 00:30:24.449\nCuz these are processes spun by\nWindows in service accounts and\n\n621\n00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:28.790\nlocal service accounts, network\nservice accounts, things like that.\n\n622\n00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.240\nThese are the NT AUTHORITY accounts,\nreally just running on our behalf,\n\n623\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.020\nproxying to open up system connections and\nstuff like that.\n\n624\n00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.270\nIf you take a look,\nyou'll see that the user blocked there.\n\n625\n00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.050\nWe have to extend it out a little bit,\nshows you what account is being used.\n\n626\n00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.000\nSome are local service, some are system,\nsome are network service, etc.\n\n627\n00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.430\nAnd we can choose an individual one.\n\n628\n00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:53.224\nAnd when I do that, if I hover,\nyou'll see that it tells me,\n\n629\n00:30:53.224 --> 00:30:56.896\nright, what the particular\nSVC host item is.\n\n630\n00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:59.720\nThe one above that I was hovering\nover was the DHCP client.\n\n631\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.730\nThis one you could see Application\nExperience, Group Policy Client,\n\n632\n00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.220\nthere's a bunch of stuff\nrunning under this alias.\n\n633\n00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.510\nIt would probably be a really good\nidea for us to have a sense of\n\n634\n00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.850\nwhat each one of these things do, and\nthen look at what's going on with memory.\n\n635\n00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.050\nAnd we can walk through the system\nactually looking at every one of\n\n636\n00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.350\nthese as we go.\n\n637\n00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.850\nSo again,\nthis is all volatile information.\n\n638\n00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.450\nHow are we gonna capture all that?\n\n639\n00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.510\nIt's gonna take a while for\nus to walk through all this, right?\n\n640\n00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.020\nIf you think about it, it's not gonna\nbe just a slam dunk where we say, yeah,\n\n641\n00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.730\nlook, boom, and we get it all, right?\n\n642\n00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.950\nThis can take a little bit.\n\n643\n00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.060\nBut the point is, when we go through and\nlook at something like this,\n\n644\n00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.900\nwe can actually see exactly what's\nbeing done under the guise or\n\n645\n00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.310\nunder the proxy of\nthe svchost.exe process.\n\n646\n00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.740\nAnd this is something that is\nhard to figure out otherwise,\n\n647\n00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.500\nbecause a lot of times, you'll see it.\n\n648\n00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.932\nAnd you can see there's probably 10 or\n12 of them running there.\n\n649\n00:31:46.932 --> 00:31:49.053\nNow granted,\nI have a lot of tools open, right?\n\n650\n00:31:49.053 --> 00:31:51.563\nWe're creating a lot of connections\nto demo things for you.\n\n651\n00:31:51.563 --> 00:31:55.002\nThis is kind of unusual activity based\non what a normal box would look like.\n\n652\n00:31:55.002 --> 00:31:56.161\nBut having said that,\n\n653\n00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:59.155\nI can still see there's a lot\ngoing on under some of these.\n\n654\n00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:02.106\nAnd it would be real tough for\nus to normally unwrap that and\n\n655\n00:32:02.106 --> 00:32:03.260\nfigure out what it is.\n\n656\n00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.720\nI think I cut you off,\nyou were gonna say something [CROSSTALK].\n\n657\n00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.925\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was gonna say I actually\nhad to use a tool similar to this.\n\n658\n00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:11.863\nIt might actually have been this one,\nbecause malware had taken over someone's\n\n659\n00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:15.000\nmachine and\nit was hijacking the SVC host, right?\n\n660\n00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.670\nAnd yeah,\nyou can kill the SVC host process, but\n\n661\n00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:21.940\nthen there's a bunch of processes wrapped\nup usually inside of those SVC hosts.\n\n662\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.420\nWe have to figure out which one exactly\nwas getting hijacked so we could kill that\n\n663\n00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.860\none and not every single one of them,\nbecause the person needs their computer.\n\n664\n00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.710\nAnd then, we were able to figure out\nwhere the malware was coming from,\n\n665\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.110\nforensically looking through,\nokay, there's the process.\n\n666\n00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.540\nIt's in this.\nIt's hiding in SVC host.\n\n667\n00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.730\nNow we can go and delete it, remove it,\nand it can go back to normal use.\n\n668\n00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.432\nAnd without something like this,\nwe never would have found that.\n\n669\n00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:48.800\n&gt;&gt; So it's a perfect example in the real\nworld, as Daniel was just describing.\n\n670\n00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.020\nAnd the kinda reason why tools\nlike this could be so valuable.\n\n671\n00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.440\nAnd this is the exact thing that\nwe often get called on to do,\n\n672\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.990\neither as an IT professional that may or\nmay not be a forensics investigator, or\n\n673\n00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.460\ncertainly after the fact.\n\n674\n00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.370\nRight, as somebody who's a forensic\ninvestigator unwrapping what may\n\n675\n00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:05.920\nhave happened.\n\n676\n00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.180\nYou know, Daniel responded more\nfrom the IT perspective saying hey,\n\n677\n00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.160\nas an IT administrator,\nas an IT professional, there's a problem.\n\n678\n00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.840\nSomebody called this in,\nlet's fix it, not so\n\n679\n00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.440\nmuch as a forensic investor\nsaying how do we get the malware?\n\n680\n00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.606\nBut rather let's just get rid of it so\nwe get you back to normal.\n\n681\n00:33:21.606 --> 00:33:25.309\nDaniel may have followed up right and\ndone the due diligence and\n\n682\n00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:29.490\nexercised an investigative process\nafter the fact to unravel that.\n\n683\n00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.500\nHe may not of, right?\n\n684\n00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.550\nWe don't know.\n\n685\n00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.294\nBut the reality is whether he did or not,\nhe used the forensic tool or at least\n\n686\n00:33:35.294 --> 00:33:39.020\na tool that could be used forensically\nto accomplish a very important thing,\n\n687\n00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.170\nwhich was to rid the system of malware,\nreturn it to normal operation.\n\n688\n00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.790\nHe may then have handed it over to\nsomebody else, somebody like you, right,\n\n689\n00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.680\nor me or anybody who may be going through\nthis material, who ultimately then would\n\n690\n00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.210\nhave been able to walk through and\nunravel the mystery, right.\n\n691\n00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.250\nKind of walk it back and figure out\nthe root cause as to how it happened.\n\n692\n00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.850\nSo it's a great example, right,\nof what you could do in the real world.\n\n693\n00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.370\nLet's go back and just take a look\nat what this tool would do for us.\n\n694\n00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.410\nSo we'll pick a process,\nI have gone up and\n\n695\n00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.390\nhovered and\nchosen the one that's the DHCP client.\n\n696\n00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.539\nWe'll take a look at that,\nso we'll launch that one,\n\n697\n00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:10.906\nwe'll just go ahead and map that.\n\n698\n00:34:10.906 --> 00:34:12.800\nSo we'll give that second.\n\n699\n00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.430\nAnd there we go.\n\n700\n00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.620\nKinda just drops down, comes back up.\n\n701\n00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.462\nRandomness in the tool form today.\n\n702\n00:34:17.462 --> 00:34:18.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Randomness.\n&gt;&gt; And so as we go and\n\n703\n00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.550\nwe can see,\nwe see all of the memory mapping.\n\n704\n00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:25.130\nNow we'll see here it gives us\nthe process, gives us the PID.\n\n705\n00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.490\nSo it does show us all\nof that right up there.\n\n706\n00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.600\nSo it tells us what the process and\nthe PID is, shows us the committed,\n\n707\n00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.030\nprivate and working set memory,\ncolor codes that breaks it down and\n\n708\n00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.780\nthen it shows us all of\nthe information in the memory map,\n\n709\n00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.370\nbreaks it out for\nus giving us different information.\n\n710\n00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.091\nAgain, shows us the addressing down\nbelow and allows us to go in and\n\n711\n00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:50.276\ndrill through opening up those plus\nsigns to actually see the memory map and\n\n712\n00:34:50.276 --> 00:34:53.943\nsee the individual areas in memory\nthat have been allocated out.\n\n713\n00:34:53.943 --> 00:34:57.730\nSo if we come down and we open that up.\n\n714\n00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.770\nWe can see the read write block and\nthe heap.\n\n715\n00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.230\nAnd we can see information about it,\nright here down at the bottom.\n\n716\n00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.560\nWe can come in and\nwe can drill through and\n\n717\n00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.520\nwe can begin to see information,\nright ,that is sharable, not sharable.\n\n718\n00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.641\nWhat's happening is it read only, read or\n\n719\n00:35:12.641 --> 00:35:15.110\nwrite, what kind of activity\nis taking place there?\n\n720\n00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.790\nAnd we can get some detailed\ninformation about the memory.\n\n721\n00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.305\nWe of course can go in,\nwe can save this information off so\n\n722\n00:35:22.305 --> 00:35:25.055\nwe can create detailed\nsummaries of what's happening.\n\n723\n00:35:25.055 --> 00:35:30.185\nWe can copy an address and we could then\nwork with it, we can take a look at and\n\n724\n00:35:30.185 --> 00:35:33.922\nopen up individual strings,\nkinda drill in and pull those out.\n\n725\n00:35:33.922 --> 00:35:35.402\nSo we've got some options there.\n\n726\n00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:38.682\nWe can clear the working set, so\nwe could kinda reset it if we need to.\n\n727\n00:35:38.682 --> 00:35:42.332\nAnd we just have some options about\nhow we actual see information,\n\n728\n00:35:42.332 --> 00:35:44.432\njust kinda configuring it and\nlooking at it.\n\n729\n00:35:44.432 --> 00:35:50.022\nSo if I wanted to save something here,\njust do a save as,\n\n730\n00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:54.022\njust dump it on the desktop, I would\nget a .mmp file, a memory map file.\n\n731\n00:35:54.022 --> 00:35:57.660\nSo I would just save it as,\nlet's say svchost, MMP.\n\n732\n00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:02.490\nSo now, I have this information captured\nin a way that I can then go back and\n\n733\n00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.480\nrefer to.\n\n734\n00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.355\nWe often talk about how do you\ncapture the information forensically,\n\n735\n00:36:06.355 --> 00:36:07.777\nhow do we take it out of the system?\n\n736\n00:36:07.777 --> 00:36:11.264\nAgain, we would save it, but\nwe would modify the path and put it off\n\n737\n00:36:11.264 --> 00:36:15.501\ninto a forensically sound recovery device\nthat would allow us to capture that and\n\n738\n00:36:15.501 --> 00:36:17.410\nthen examine it offline later.\n\n739\n00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.850\nCapturing what's going on with the virtual\nmemory in the system while it's still\n\n740\n00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.260\nactive, that essentially gives us\nthe ability to understand that, right?\n\n741\n00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.970\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n742\n00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:27.980\nThat's something else we could do here,\nyet\n\n743\n00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.530\nanother way of using this similar tool.\n\n744\n00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.250\nOne more thing with memory that\nwe just wanna take a look at,\n\n745\n00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.740\nI mentioned in one of the prior\nepisodes a tool called PMDump.\n\n746\n00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.794\nI told you that you may have trouble\nfinding it because it's not always\n\n747\n00:36:39.794 --> 00:36:40.370\navailable.\n\n748\n00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.490\nI have a copy of it.\n\n749\n00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:42.950\nI wanted to show you quickly how it works.\n\n750\n00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.640\nVery simple command line tool.\n\n751\n00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:51.770\nWhen we execute PMDump,\na gentleman named Arne Vidstrom who's\n\n752\n00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.170\nrelatively well known in these circles\nbecause he's created a number of tools.\n\n753\n00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.860\nThe website there,\nyou can see ntsecurity.nu.\n\n754\n00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.820\nGreat website,\nit's got a lot of tools there.\n\n755\n00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.570\nSo I mentioned at the time\nI went out to it.\n\n756\n00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.740\nRecently the website for some reason\nwas not allowing download of the tools.\n\n757\n00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.200\nSo you may have a bit of\na trouble finding the tool.\n\n758\n00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.900\nBut if you poke around online\nyou can find copies of it.\n\n759\n00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.390\nBut this and many other tools\nthat he created over the years,\n\n760\n00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.750\nphenomenal set of tools for\nsecurity, for forensics.\n\n761\n00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.050\nCan be doing a lot of\ndifferent things with them.\n\n762\n00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:24.100\nWork today, even in the most recent\noperating systems so you can use them.\n\n763\n00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.690\nPMDump, very simple you need\na process ID and or file name.\n\n764\n00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.880\nSo we're just gonna go in and\n\n765\n00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.980\ngrab a process ID really quickly and take\na look at this just so we understand one.\n\n766\n00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.110\nI think we had 868.\n\n767\n00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.300\nI think that was one of\nthe ones we were looking at.\n\n768\n00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.830\nSo let's just use that.\n\n769\n00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.160\nAnd actually you know what I have it here,\n1084 for Chrome we'll use that one.\n\n770\n00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.740\nSo if we put up Chrome,\none of the processes for\n\n771\n00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:51.200\nChrome, we can dump the information and\nwe can actually dump it out to a file.\n\n772\n00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.910\nAnd I've done this already, I've taken\nthe process dump or the memory map dump\n\n773\n00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:01.000\nfrom 184 the process for one of\nthe Chrome browser sessions I have open.\n\n774\n00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.600\nI've created a text file.\n\n775\n00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.240\nI've dumped that just to\nthe root of the C-Drive.\n\n776\n00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.080\nAnd you'll see it right there.\n\n777\n00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.320\nSo I did that a little bit ago.\n\n778\n00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.370\nAnd you'll see it's a rather large one.\n\n779\n00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.350\nI made the mistake of not realizing\nhow big it was when I did this.\n\n780\n00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.470\nI tried to open a Notepad and\nlocked Notepad up,\n\n781\n00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.260\nbecause it won't deal\nwith a file this big.\n\n782\n00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:23.030\nBut, you can take this file and you could\nthen investigate it with other tools.\n\n783\n00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.680\nSo that's essentially a dump of the live\nmemory that's being used to drive\n\n784\n00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.120\nthe Chrome.exe process at\nthe time that I make it.\n\n785\n00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.620\nAnd that's again a forensically sound\ncapture of what going on in memory,\n\n786\n00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.170\nassuming we send it off to device that\nwill allow us to be able to capture it\n\n787\n00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.000\nwithout write back.\n\n788\n00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.840\nSo if we did something like this, I'll\nput it into a file we could then specify\n\n789\n00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.190\nthe path, E:, whatever if we mount it\nexternally and we'd be able to do that.\n\n790\n00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.640\nAnd then we would get a list of, or\nrather a dump of all the information.\n\n791\n00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.140\nNow if we don't know the process list,\nor we don't have a list of processes.\n\n792\n00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.400\nAll we do, you'll see,\nthere's a listing option here,\n\n793\n00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.840\njust do PMDump list,\nlists all the processes for us.\n\n794\n00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.050\nWe then choose the one we\nwant to interrogate, and\n\n795\n00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.180\nwe then simply dump the information.\n\n796\n00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.930\nSo PMDump is essentially command\nline version of what VMDump and\n\n797\n00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.970\nRAM dump are in the sysinternals tool set,\nright?\n\n798\n00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.590\nBecause this lets us do this in\nthe command line to a text file,\n\n799\n00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.300\nwhereas the graphical editor tools,\n\n800\n00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.920\nthe ones we took a look at\nessentially do the same thing, but\n\n801\n00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.370\nthey give you the graphical interface,\nthey pull the information for you.\n\n802\n00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.980\nYou don't have to worry about\nessentially going in and figuring out,\n\n803\n00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.740\nright, how to read all the data offline\nbecause you can do it on the system,\n\n804\n00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.010\nor rather through the tool in the system.\n\n805\n00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.740\nSo just keep in mind there's\nmultiple ways to do this.\n\n806\n00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.100\nOne is not better than the others.\n\n807\n00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.250\nThe question is how we approach it,\nmore often than not.\n\n808\n00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Adam.\n\n809\n00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.565\nI was in the middle of taking a breath.\n\n810\n00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:45.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect timing.\n\n811\n00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.580\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n812\n00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.960\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of perfect timing,\nreally cool demonstrations, right?\n\n813\n00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.300\nBeing able to see what's going on inside\nof our systems, especially what's actually\n\n814\n00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.210\nin the RAM, what is being processed at\nthat point in time, what is the map\n\n815\n00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:04.100\nof that process, can be very useful\ninformation for us as investigators.\n\n816\n00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:09.100\nSo make sure you become familiar with\nthese tools that Adam has shown us today.\n\n817\n00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.990\nDon't just go, yeah,\nit was a really cool tool.\n\n818\n00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.970\nGo grab a copy of it, download it,\nuse it, play with it, so\n\n819\n00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.590\nthat you have some working\nknowledge of it as well.\n\n820\n00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.190\nSo that it will help you in the long run,\n\n821\n00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.790\ncuz then you'll start getting\nsome practical knowledge.\n\n822\n00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.850\nThat's what it's all about.\n\n823\n00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.410\nThat being said Adam,\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n824\n00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.480\nBut we have plenty more of\nWindows forensics to come for\n\n825\n00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.630\nyou good people out there.\n\n826\n00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.550\nSo stay tuned, part four is on its way.\n\n827\n00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.820\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n828\n00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.450\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n829\n00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Burdick.\n\n830\n00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.140\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n831\n00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.095\n&gt;&gt; The mad memory mapper.\n\n832\n00:40:38.095 --> 00:40:40.348\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n833\n00:40:40.348 --> 00:40:46.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n834\n00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.479\nThank you for watching

00:00:12.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.250\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.730\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're continuing on with more\n\n7\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.590\non our CHFI, specifically part\nfour in Windows forensics.\n\n8\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.070\nJoining us back in the lab yet\nagain is our good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.410\nAdam welcome back, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.260\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, I was just busy mapping\nmemory while we were taking a break and\n\n11\n00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.978\ntalking about all of\nthe things you can do with it.\n\n12\n00:00:34.978 --> 00:00:38.540\nSo, we're gonna continue our conversations\nhere talking a little bit more\n\n13\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.360\nabout Windows forensics,\nas Daniel suggested.\n\n14\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.230\nThe ideas, as we've been talking about in\nall of the episodes associated with this\n\n15\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.470\ntopic of what we can do inside\nof the Windows machine.\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.870\nForensically understanding\nthe information there.\n\n17\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.580\nCapturing in a way that's going to\nallow us to have the information.\n\n18\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.700\nForensically sound and in a way that\nwe can then work with either offline or\n\n19\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.550\nthrough a copy against the original,\nthen be able to examine it and\n\n20\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.370\nunderstand what may be going on there.\n\n21\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.860\nWe left off talking about memory and\nmemory mapping, all of the interesting,\n\n22\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.290\nfun things you can do with memory.\n\n23\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.510\nAnd what we're gonna do now is take\na look at some additional tools online\n\n24\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.170\nthat may be of interest to you.\n\n25\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.560\nWhat we see, when we go in and\n\n26\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.000\ndelve into the Windows Search Index, what\nkind of information maybe found there.\n\n27\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.040\nTake a look at how we discover hidden\npartitions, talk about those a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.510\nWeb browser caches, cookies, temp files,\n\n29\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.940\nshow you a couple of programs that let us\npull that information out, not just for\n\n30\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.930\nIE by the way, but for\nany browser we use on the system.\n\n31\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.185\nA lot of us load up and\nuse more than one browser.\n\n32\n00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:42.965\nIE, Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n33\n00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.195\nWe'll show you a tool that\nlets us pull that stuff out.\n\n34\n00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.535\nWe've talked a little bit\nabout memory dump files, and\n\n35\n00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:49.185\nhow to analyze them already.\n\n36\n00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:52.085\nI'll just give a little\npush in that direction with\n\n37\n00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:55.975\nat least a citation from a KB article\nthat we've put in the show notes for you.\n\n38\n00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.135\nSo, some interesting things.\n\n39\n00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.390\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's take a look down here or up there,\n\n40\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090\ndepending on where it may be.\n\n41\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.800\nRight up there above me, as we say.\n\n42\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.880\nSo we're gonna take a look again at\nsome of the stuff that we can do.\n\n43\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.835\nLet me pull up the magical\nbrowser of the web and\n\n44\n00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.910\nlet's get back to where we were here.\n\n45\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.160\nSearch index examiner, this is the most\nrecent version of the product.\n\n46\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.896\nBut this allows us to go in and\npull information out of the Windows search\n\n47\n00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.835\nindex, what we all the desktop\nsearch database there.\n\n48\n00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:30.558\nIt's gonna allow us as a tool to go in and\ngrab information from the system.\n\n49\n00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:34.098\nThe index or service in Windows,\nwhen you're running it, it keeps track of\n\n50\n00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.154\neverything on the system,\nmakes it easier for you to do a search.\n\n51\n00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.244\nWhen you do Windows key letter F,\nright to do a find.\n\n52\n00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:43.819\nIf it comes up quickly, you were able to\nfigure out what information is there,\n\n53\n00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.855\nit's because the Windows index\nservices are running and there's\n\n54\n00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:50.990\na lot of information gathered over the\nlifetime in the system that's found there.\n\n55\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.570\nSo this tool let's us go\nin this piece of software,\n\n56\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.020\nlet's us go in and access the information\nin the database and pull out what's there.\n\n57\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.150\nAgain, not a free tool.\n\n58\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.060\nYou can see it's a few hundred dollars,\nUS.\n\n59\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.360\nBut the things it does allow us to do,\nas you can take a look,\n\n60\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.630\nlist all emails, documents, spreadsheets,\n\n61\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.220\nany other kind of document that may be\nindexed through the desktop search,\n\n62\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.280\nretrieve information, look at metadata,\nin other words, we could go in.\n\n63\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.140\nWe can take a look at and\nexport data in a variety of formats,\n\n64\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.360\nXML, Comma Separated Value.\n\n65\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.560\nSo we have couple of\ndifferent options there.\n\n66\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.260\nWe can recover damaged databases.\n\n67\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.380\nSo if the search database has been\ndamaged, we maybe able to recover that.\n\n68\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.844\nNotice it works with Server 2008, server\n12 or, there's no such thing as server 13.\n\n69\n00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:39.908\n&gt;&gt; 2013 [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you get the idea.\n\n70\n00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.645\nWindows 7, etc.\n\n71\n00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:45.415\nBut you can use a tool like this to be\nable to go in and recover information.\n\n72\n00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:49.705\nThis is maybe one way to go in and recover\ninformation from the search database.\n\n73\n00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:53.205\nWe can also go in and\nlook at partition information.\n\n74\n00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:56.125\nHidden partitions,\nwe've shown you in some other episodes.\n\n75\n00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.110\nDrive editors will allow us to do this.\n\n76\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.730\nWe'll take a look at some upcoming\ndiscussions about how we recover deleted\n\n77\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.140\nfiles and partitions.\n\n78\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.080\nThis tool, among others,\nare tools that could be used to do that.\n\n79\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.720\nPartition logic,\nreason I like this one, it's free.\n\n80\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.088\nSo as I've often said, why spend money for\nsomething when you can essentially\n\n81\n00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:14.143\naccomplish the same thing on your own for\nfree.\n\n82\n00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:18.901\nThis tool allows you to go in and you'll\nbe able to create, delete, erase, format,\n\n83\n00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:22.619\ndefrag, resize, copy,\nmove partitions but also examine them.\n\n84\n00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:26.055\nSo we are gonna be able to,\nyou get a lot of value out of doing that.\n\n85\n00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:27.580\nWe can go in and download that.\n\n86\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.000\nYou could see it there.\n\n87\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.514\nFree to use, good to go,\nfree to use if you will.\n\n88\n00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:36.210\nBut it's one of many tools that's\navailable to us to be able to look at\n\n89\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.184\nthe partitions.\n\n90\n00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:40.767\nAnd so we'll to take a look at the other\ntools that may be valuable in this\n\n91\n00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:41.620\nregard as well.\n\n92\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.755\nBut again just an idea, there may\nbe hidden partitions on the disk.\n\n93\n00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:48.261\nAnd obviously being able to figure out\nwhat they are would be valuable for us.\n\n94\n00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:51.876\nRemember we've talked about slack\nspace and things of that nature,\n\n95\n00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:55.820\nbeing able to look at information in\na variety of ways is always a good idea.\n\n96\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.010\nAnd partition editors,\nyou remember PartEd, the partition editor?\n\n97\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.085\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, old stuff, still use it.\n\n98\n00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:01.760\n&gt;&gt; Oldie but a goodie, right?\n\n99\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.270\nYeah, so\ntools like that had been around for many,\n\n100\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.760\nmany years and had been the\nadministrator's friend forever and a day.\n\n101\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.552\n&gt;&gt; I remember a partition magic.\n\n102\n00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:11.160\n&gt;&gt; Partition magic, right.\n\n103\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.864\n&gt;&gt; We call it partition magic.\n\n104\n00:05:12.864 --> 00:05:14.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n105\n00:05:14.098 --> 00:05:15.620\nyou could resize partitions\nwith it as well.\n\n106\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you could.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of stuff you could do.\n\n107\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.220\nYou could recover data\nfrom partitions with it.\n\n108\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.672\nRemember also, anyway we talked about\nthat per se, but there are often hidden\n\n109\n00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.617\npartitions in most systems today for\nrecovery purposes, right?\n\n110\n00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.431\nYou've vendors who'll often put\nthose in there and we will,\n\n111\n00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:32.111\nwithout necessarily realizing, it\nprobably, there is information that may be\n\n112\n00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:34.817\nhidden there because lot of\ntimes bad actors will realize,\n\n113\n00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.055\nhey there is a 100 meg partition or\nwhatever.\n\n114\n00:05:37.055 --> 00:05:40.196\nAnd I may not necessarily\nunderstand it's there, but\n\n115\n00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:42.300\nI can actually go in and see it.\n\n116\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.880\nAnd then recover it, and so\nit's something to think about.\n\n117\n00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.035\nAs a matter of fact,\nlet me give you a quick little demo,\n\n118\n00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.412\nan insight if you will, into the kind of\nthing that we can take a look at there.\n\n119\n00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:58.968\nLet me just find the appropriate\nmachine tool that we are looking for.\n\n120\n00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:05.829\nAnd I believe that one should be\na little one, let's just do that.\n\n121\n00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:07.885\nDo that, do that, do that.\n\n122\n00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:11.455\nAnd, for instance, we'll take a look\nlike this in an upcoming conversation,\n\n123\n00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:15.020\na little more deeply really just showing\nyou at a high level what it can do.\n\n124\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.990\nBut a tool like mini tool power data\nrecovery, damage partition recovery, lost\n\n125\n00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.310\npartition recovery, we can find partitions\nthat don't appear in the system but\n\n126\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.920\nare actually there as hidden partitions,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.564\nAnd so, we could scan the system and\nwe could then actually go through and\n\n128\n00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.910\ntake a look using tools\nlike this to find them.\n\n129\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.490\nSo, this is something that\nbecomes really valuable and\n\n130\n00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.720\nsomething that we wanna be able to do and\nthere's many tools that will do this.\n\n131\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.725\nI'm just picking one randomly that\nI happen to have installed for\n\n132\n00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:46.520\nuse to show you but we can find lots of\ntools that will do this kind of thing.\n\n133\n00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.990\nKeep that in mind, with regards\nto what's going on on the web.\n\n134\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.350\nWeb browser, information,\nthings like that.\n\n135\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.620\nI've had a bunch of web\nsites lined up in Google.\n\n136\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.500\nWe've kinda been cranking through\nthem episode by episode showing you\n\n137\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.290\na bunch of things.\n\n138\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.390\nStill got a bunch left over\nhere here to go through.\n\n139\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.643\nSome interesting stuff coming up.\n\n140\n00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:03.489\nBut let's minimize this for a second and\n\n141\n00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:06.207\nlet's take a look at two tools\nthat may be of interest to us.\n\n142\n00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:08.330\nOne is a cookie viewer.\n\n143\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.300\nThis one happens to be\nthe cookie viewer for IE.\n\n144\n00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.680\nWe have versions of these tools that allow\nus to pull cookies from any browser.\n\n145\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.070\nYou just have to go out and\nfind the right one.\n\n146\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.870\nBut this one, IE CookieView,\nfree tool, can download easily.\n\n147\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.910\nAccess the cookies, so\nyou could see them there.\n\n148\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.690\nWe could see all sorts of different\ncookies that have been created,\n\n149\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.850\nwhen they were created, number of hits,\naccess modification creation dates.\n\n150\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.730\nSo we can go in, you highlight\nwhichever one that happens to be.\n\n151\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.480\nWhen we do that, we can go in and\nsee where it was created, when,\n\n152\n00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.970\nunder what circumstances created in,\nor by the client.\n\n153\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.590\nSo we can go in and find that information.\n\n154\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.690\nI can go to Properties.\n\n155\n00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.680\nI can pull it up.\n\n156\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.091\nI can take a look at\ninformation on the cookie.\n\n157\n00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:54.789\nI can also go in and\nI can edit the cookie's content.\n\n158\n00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:59.082\nAnd so I actually can go in as a hacking\ntool, and or as a recovery tool, and\n\n159\n00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:02.350\nI can actually modify\nthe contents of the cookie.\n\n160\n00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.460\nSo a tool like this lets me recover it.\n\n161\n00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.243\nBut again, as we've often talked about,\nDaniel made this point in one of our prior\n\n162\n00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:11.809\nepisodes, and he's absolutely right to\ncall it out that a lot of these tools,\n\n163\n00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:15.104\ncuz you said a lot of these tools,\na lot of this knowledge, can be used for\n\n164\n00:08:15.104 --> 00:08:15.785\ngood or evil.\n\n165\n00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:18.038\nExcept you didn't say that,\nthat's my being dramatic.\n\n166\n00:08:18.038 --> 00:08:21.340\nBut what you said was essentially,\nhey, in the hands of the right person\n\n167\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.440\nthese tools are great,\nthey can be used to recover data.\n\n168\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.257\nIn the hands of the hacker,\nthese tools could cause a lot of damage,\n\n169\n00:08:26.257 --> 00:08:27.606\nand you're absolutely right.\n\n170\n00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:30.990\nFrom the very beginning of our discussions\nin this area, one of the very first\n\n171\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.554\nepisodes we did maybe in the first one and\nseveral of them going forward.\n\n172\n00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:38.983\nI made the point that pre-requisite\nacknowledgement stuff like CEH,\n\n173\n00:08:38.983 --> 00:08:43.704\nis not required to be successful with\npassing, taking a passing CHFI exam,\n\n174\n00:08:43.704 --> 00:08:46.016\nbut, it will very valuable for you.\n\n175\n00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:49.210\nIt will give you a foundational\nelements in knowledge.\n\n176\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.390\nAnd in the real world,\nequally importantly to Daniel's point,\n\n177\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.290\nit will give you a leg up\non the competition, right?\n\n178\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.490\nBecause you're gonna think like a hacker,\nso as a recovery expert,\n\n179\n00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.040\nyou need to have that sense of knowledge,\nwhere all the bad apps is operating,\n\n180\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.170\nwhat are they doing,\nwhat can they get up to.\n\n181\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.170\nIf I can modify cookies I can\nmanipulate the way the system\n\n182\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.720\nrecognizes a user under what\nconditions they do that,\n\n183\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.740\nand I can create essentially\nmy own vision of the data.\n\n184\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.594\nThat's a really powerful thing for\n\n185\n00:09:15.594 --> 00:09:19.362\nus to know as a recovery professional\nbecause it means the cookies may not\n\n186\n00:09:19.362 --> 00:09:22.905\nactually represent accurately\ninformation stored in the system.\n\n187\n00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.765\nAnd we have to be aware of that,\nand so modify the cookies is really\n\n188\n00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:29.250\njust a matter literally of clicking that\nbutton right there for make a change.\n\n189\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.880\nAnd all of a sudden that cookie\ndoes not look like it did.\n\n190\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.610\nSo, this is important for us to know like\nwith all these other tools we can go in,\n\n191\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.410\nwe can open as you'll see here under\nthe File menu, I can select cookies,\n\n192\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.230\nopen them.\n\n193\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.210\nI can look at the website, I can edit or\nrather look at information.\n\n194\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.540\nI can edit it, I can save off selected\ncookies so I can grab them and\n\n195\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.430\nsave them, so I could do all sorts\nof stuff with a tool like this.\n\n196\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.330\nAnd again, we have tools like\nthis from a variety of sources,\n\n197\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.640\nnot just for IE, we can get them and use\nthem with any of the major web browsers.\n\n198\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.232\nWe can also go in and we can use a tool,\n\n199\n00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:09.178\nthis one is called BrowsingHistory\nas you can see here.\n\n200\n00:10:09.178 --> 00:10:12.913\nNow we can see that when we do\nbrowsing history we can go in and\n\n201\n00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:17.825\nwe can view the browsing history across\nany browser installed on the system.\n\n202\n00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:19.920\nSo this is not just,\nhey, let's look at IE,\n\n203\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.430\nyou're gonna see that there's\na bunch of IE stuff here.\n\n204\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.819\nBut as I scroll down, you'll see that\nthe Google icon becomes more apparent, and\n\n205\n00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:30.317\nwe're in the middle right there of\na bunch of stuff with Google and\n\n206\n00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:33.331\nwe can see that I've got both\nentries sitting in there.\n\n207\n00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:37.380\nIf I fire up Firefox or\nSafari I'll see all that stuff.\n\n208\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.722\nI can see every one of them,\nall the URLs I've gone to, so\n\n209\n00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:43.101\nI can go in and see all this information.\n\n210\n00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.506\n[CROSSTALK] Tool.\n\n211\n00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:46.930\nMore of an aggregation tool for\nall of the browsers.\n\n212\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.923\nMost people have a few\ndifferent browsers on their-\n\n213\n00:10:48.923 --> 00:10:51.271\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely, pull everything in,\n\n214\n00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.827\nbut in addition so we've got the title\nof the site, visit time, visit count,\n\n215\n00:10:55.827 --> 00:10:59.022\nnumber of times I went,\nvisited from web browser use.\n\n216\n00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:04.182\nSo, it'll identify the web browser, user\nprofile, what was the user that did this,\n\n217\n00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:08.870\nthe browser profile, the URL length and\nthe information associated with it.\n\n218\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.920\nThis is free software by the way, right?\n\n219\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.266\nThis comes from, if you could see\ndown there on the bottom, NirSoft,\n\n220\n00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:18.510\ngreat vendor, it has a lot of cool stuff.\n\n221\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.180\nSo, nirsoft.net,\nwe've got again the URLs for\n\n222\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.330\nyou, you'll capture them in the show nets,\nyou go in and take a look.\n\n223\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.170\nBut we can go in, pull up any one of these\nand you'll notice that I can zoom in,\n\n224\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.480\nI can take a look, or\nwhen I zoom in I should say.\n\n225\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.280\nI can take a look saves selected items,\ncopy and open in our browser and\n\n226\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.200\ngo back and reconstitute this\nlooking at what the users looked at.\n\n227\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.850\nI can take a look on an HTML\nreport to pulls all this data out.\n\n228\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.310\nI can see the properties of this, there's\na bunch of stuffs that I can do here that\n\n229\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:54.742\nwill allow me to be able to use\nthis particular information.\n\n230\n00:11:54.742 --> 00:12:01.240\nSo, I've got a lot of information here, if\nI go in and I take each to a port or what\n\n231\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.350\nI'm gonna do is to pull out the very port\nvery quickly, so I'm going right away.\n\n232\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.680\nAnd I've got a detailed report, in HTML,\nof everything captured in the tool.\n\n233\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.260\nAnd so, I can go in, for instance,\n\n234\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.350\nclick on this particular site right here,\nthat link right there, and\n\n235\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.800\nnotice that it loads up, and actually\npulls up the site for me in real time.\n\n236\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.620\nSo, as an investigator I now have\na complete record of all the web URLs that\n\n237\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.810\nhave been visited by this particular\nuser that's available for me offline.\n\n238\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.470\nI can now go look at those sites without\ninteracting with the mama main machine.\n\n239\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.620\nI don't have to worry about having\nan issue where I create, potentially,\n\n240\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.820\na back flow of information and\ninfection because I get malware and\n\n241\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.480\nwho knows what coming off the site.\n\n242\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.360\nI just have to take that report, export\nit, save it, and then use it offline.\n\n243\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.654\nSo a took like this, again free,\nit's incredibly valuable and\n\n244\n00:12:49.654 --> 00:12:53.802\nimportant to us as a investigator in the\nWindows world, we have tools that will do\n\n245\n00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:57.340\nthe same thing in a Linux system\nusing other browsers, absolutely.\n\n246\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.674\nThere are tools that will do this kind\nof thing across any system on the Mac\n\n247\n00:13:00.674 --> 00:13:04.462\nplatform using their platform,\ntheir software, their browser, absolutely.\n\n248\n00:13:04.462 --> 00:13:06.160\nThere are tools that will\ngive you the same thing.\n\n249\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.240\nSo it's not hard to do, it's just\na matter of going in and figuring out\n\n250\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.780\nexactly where these things are, and\nof course how to then deal with them.\n\n251\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.483\nAnd so there's all sorts of stuff that\nwe can go in and take a look at here.\n\n252\n00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:22.240\nWe can go back to my machine,\nhow do we generate a memory dump?\n\n253\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.450\nI said I would give you a little\npush in the right direction.\n\n254\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.084\nWe've shown a couple of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n255\n00:13:26.084 --> 00:13:29.782\nIf you wanna read the Microsoft\ndocumentation on how to create memory\n\n256\n00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:34.389\ndumps coming out of their system, ignore\nthe fact that it's on the older platforms.\n\n257\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.040\nIt will work for anything, but\nyou can go in and take a look here.\n\n258\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.730\nWe'll give you a little sight.\n\n259\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.968\nIt kind of walks through all the different\nsteps involved with the paging file,\n\n260\n00:13:44.968 --> 00:13:47.938\nhow to access it,\nhow to do a memory dump, how to go in and\n\n261\n00:13:47.938 --> 00:13:50.236\nget the boot configuration data editors.\n\n262\n00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:52.337\nThat may be necessary for\nyou to look at the data,\n\n263\n00:13:52.337 --> 00:13:56.360\nbecause when we get a memory dump, it's in\na format that we can't always understand.\n\n264\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.180\nAnd so\nwe need tools that can interpret it.\n\n265\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.980\nSo they give you the memory information,\nthey also give you the URL or,\n\n266\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.470\nexcuse me, the registry keys\nthat you'll need to know.\n\n267\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.733\nSo, there's a lot of information in here,\nreferences, your new\n\n268\n00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:11.774\nbehavior in some of the newer systems that\nyou have to be aware of in dynamic disks.\n\n269\n00:14:11.774 --> 00:14:13.623\nIt's actually really good reference for\n\n270\n00:14:13.623 --> 00:14:16.760\nyou on Windows if you wanna take\na look at how that's gonna work.\n\n271\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.639\nThe way that they actually interact,\nso it's just something to consider, so\n\n272\n00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.422\ndo feel free to follow up with that.\n\n273\n00:14:22.422 --> 00:14:26.293\nGoing in here, this is the site\nI just loaded a minute ago,\n\n274\n00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:31.191\nwhere I just pull the URL report up,\nbut the Windows or source Site here for\n\n275\n00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:33.270\nthe Windows IR/CF Tool sets.\n\n276\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.570\nThis is coming out of SourceForge,\na site where we can get a lot of forensics\n\n277\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.082\nanalysis and\nforensics server-related tools.\n\n278\n00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:44.120\nAnd so, let me hit the right\ncombination of keys there.\n\n279\n00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.370\nSo you'll see there's a Windows forensics\nanalysis fork, we can go in and\n\n280\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.210\ntake a look.\n\n281\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.469\nAnd we can go in and\nsee the stuff on OS detection, etc.\n\n282\n00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:54.574\nSo, these are some tools that will\nallow us to go in and parse memory and\n\n283\n00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:56.670\nlook at the output of memory dumps.\n\n284\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.989\nThese are external tools that we\ncan go in, take a look at and use.\n\n285\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.782\nSo if I go in, I hit here, I can come\ndown, take a look at the fact that there's\n\n286\n00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:09.563\nreg ripper, registry reference,\noffline registry parser.\n\n287\n00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:13.150\nThere's a lot of different tools\nthat are gonna be involved in here.\n\n288\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.530\nSo you definitely can go in and\ntake a look and see what's happening.\n\n289\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.630\nSo these may be some additional tools for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n290\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:26.320\nThere's also a tool called the ProcDump\ntool which I have a little side here from\n\n291\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.200\nsitecore that walks through with a nice\nlittle blog entry how to use the tool.\n\n292\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.210\nSo again, you should check this out\nif you wanna know more about it.\n\n293\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.873\nHow you get memory dumps and how you\nuse the tool, how to be able to get it.\n\n294\n00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:41.170\nThe Proc memory tool can be downloaded\nfrom Microsoft, so it's there,\n\n295\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.315\nit's a Microsoft tool.\n\n296\n00:15:42.315 --> 00:15:45.731\nSo they just talk about how to use it,\nto be able to create a memory dump and\n\n297\n00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:47.700\nget a file and\nthen go through and read it.\n\n298\n00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.281\nSo you have four or five different ways\nto be able to go and grab the memory.\n\n299\n00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:52.885\nJust a lot of differetn stuff\nthat you can take to look at.\n\n300\n00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.668\nAnd perhaps interact with.\n\n301\n00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:58.292\nWanted to go a little bit of a different\ndirection with you for minute, you would\n\n302\n00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:02.240\nhave been focusing on, kind of the Server\n2008, Windows 7 kind of environment,\n\n303\n00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.238\nshowed you a few things to stand\nin Windows 10, more up to date.\n\n304\n00:16:05.238 --> 00:16:08.996\nWant to jump in Windows 10,\none of the tools we haven't talked about\n\n305\n00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:13.074\nthat's built right in the operating\nsystem that could be valuable for you,\n\n306\n00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:15.832\nwhat I have up on the screen\nis PowerShell, right?\n\n307\n00:16:15.832 --> 00:16:17.504\nAnd we've had this not just in Windows 10,\n\n308\n00:16:17.504 --> 00:16:19.660\nit's been around in many\nversions of Windows for a while.\n\n309\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.966\nBut PowerShell will allow\nus to be able to go in and\n\n310\n00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:25.555\nto do a variety of things, right?\n\n311\n00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:27.710\nAnd so the idea that using PowerShell,\n\n312\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.988\nI may be able to forensically\nexamine information as well.\n\n313\n00:16:30.988 --> 00:16:34.338\nNow, I'm not gonna get into the details\nof how to use PowerShell, for instance.\n\n314\n00:16:34.338 --> 00:16:36.175\nThat's way beyond our conversation here.\n\n315\n00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:40.782\nBut I'm just gonna show you one very\nsimple thought process with PowerShell.\n\n316\n00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:41.400\nHow do I, for\n\n317\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.413\ninstance, extract information about the\namount of memory that a process is using?\n\n318\n00:16:45.413 --> 00:16:50.624\nUsing some of the basic information that's\navailable to us through a WMI quarry,\n\n319\n00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:53.655\nso WQL, W my query language, we call.\n\n320\n00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:54.339\nIt's fun to say.\n\n321\n00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:56.630\nWe can go in and do that.\n\n322\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.870\nWe actually can write a very simple\nPowerShell script that, effectively,\n\n323\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.750\nwith three lines of code,\nallows us to be able to do that.\n\n324\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.950\nNow, would you use PowerShell\nto do forensics examinations on\n\n325\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.330\na Windows machine?\n\n326\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.180\nCould you?\nAbsolutely,\n\n327\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.760\nwould you probably not for\nthe average human being?\n\n328\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.220\nIt would be involved, you'd have to write\na lot of scripts, you'd have to know a lot\n\n329\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.300\nabout the Windows object model, and that's\nnot well documented, it's hard to go out\n\n330\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.740\nand find information about the WMI\nclasses, or the CIM instances.\n\n331\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.570\nIt's definitely out there, but\n\n332\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.910\nit takes a lot of time, you'd have\nto learn a lot more about Windows.\n\n333\n00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.900\nI'm not suggesting you're\nnot up to the challenge,\n\n334\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.150\nby the way,\nI think you probably all could do it.\n\n335\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.410\nBut the point is, it requires some\nadditional training, and you really have\n\n336\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.210\nto go deep and broad in a programmatic\nmodeling windows to understand it.\n\n337\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.610\nBut I don't want to undersell the value of\nthe tool, which is I want to for a minute,\n\n338\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:47.010\nshow you one possible little sliver of\ncapability here and give sense what it is.\n\n339\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.930\nCan we get a full screen?\n\n340\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.890\nAl right, so we can take a look for\nthis a little bit better.\n\n341\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.410\nSo, when we run this script,\nand by the way,\n\n342\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.541\nwe do have the script in the show notes.\n\n343\n00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.568\nRight, so we are going to give you these\nscripted cell, so you can try this.\n\n344\n00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:02.330\nIt's not gonna hurt anything\non a Windows machine,\n\n345\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.460\nfully capable of running the script\nexactly as it appears in the show notes.\n\n346\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.570\nIt will not harm anything on your\nWindows machine, just to be clear.\n\n347\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.820\nThe script is perfectly vetted,\n\n348\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.830\nlegitimate, no code in there\nthat will harm you in any way.\n\n349\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.440\nGotta make sure we give you that\ndisclaimer, cuz we don't want you to\n\n350\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.990\ndownload and use code without\nunderstanding where it came from.\n\n351\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.410\n&gt;&gt; It only gives Adam a reverse\nshell to your account.\n\n352\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:21.970\n&gt;&gt; It does, yeah.\n\n353\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:22.600\n&gt;&gt; But just Adam.\n\n354\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but just nobody but me-\n&gt;&gt; You can trust him.\n\n355\n00:18:23.646 --> 00:18:24.757\n&gt;&gt; You can trust me, absolutely.\n\n356\n00:18:24.757 --> 00:18:25.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n357\n00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:31.514\nif anything goes wrong Daniel@ITPro.TV is\nwhere you wanna send those requests for-\n\n358\n00:18:31.514 --> 00:18:33.305\n&gt;&gt; I'll forward it to Adam [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:18:33.305 --> 00:18:35.127\n&gt;&gt; Right, which will come back to me.\n\n360\n00:18:35.127 --> 00:18:38.974\nExactly, all right, so let's, we can talk\nthrough the logic of the script quickly,\n\n361\n00:18:38.974 --> 00:18:40.833\njust give you a vague\nidea of how it works.\n\n362\n00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:44.200\nSo, we have a variable declared\nup there called Pname.\n\n363\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.880\nThat variable is set to Read-Host,\nthe Read-Host cmdlet.\n\n364\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.800\nAnd it says hey,\ngive me some input on the screen.\n\n365\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.760\nYeah, please input put ProcessName,\nit's the string I put in there.\n\n366\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.450\nSo, it'll prompt us for a ProcessName.\n\n367\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.200\nSo, you have this little input\nfrom the user, there, great.\n\n368\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.980\nThen we have a Get-WmiObject Command,\nwe're gonna do win32_process.\n\n369\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.480\nPipe that to where object.\n\n370\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:11.160\nSo, get the contents of win32_process\nfrom a WMI object, decoration statement.\n\n371\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.455\nPipe it,\npiping in PowerShell means pass the value\n\n372\n00:19:14.455 --> 00:19:17.685\nacross the pipe from whatever's\non the left to the right, and\n\n373\n00:19:17.685 --> 00:19:20.445\nthen work with that value as\ninput to the next statement.\n\n374\n00:19:20.445 --> 00:19:23.705\nSo, we're handing off\nthe list of Win32 processes\n\n375\n00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.357\nthat are running tool\nware object statements,\n\n376\n00:19:25.357 --> 00:19:29.337\nwhere we're gonna then use whatever\nthe process name is that we've inputted.\n\n377\n00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:34.377\nAnd we're gonna set that process, and\nwe're then gonna grab information from it.\n\n378\n00:19:34.377 --> 00:19:36.097\nWe're gonna pipe that process over.\n\n379\n00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:38.210\nWe're gonna use the select command.\n\n380\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.680\nAnd we're gonna be selecting a bunch of\nstuff, and you can see in purple here,\n\n381\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.540\nDescription, Process ID, Handle Count,\nExecutable Path, Virtual Memory Map.\n\n382\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.900\nDoing it in megabytes,\nslash 1024 sets it equal to megabytes.\n\n383\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.340\nAnd then, Working Size, right?\n\n384\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.130\nOr Working Set Size.\n\n385\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.830\nSo we're gonna declare all that.\n\n386\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.280\nThen we're going to go ahead and just echo\nback to the console through another read\n\n387\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.620\nstatement, essentially push enter for\nX, right?\n\n388\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.070\nSo, very simple little script.\n\n389\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.450\nNot a lot going on,\npretty straightforward.\n\n390\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.970\nWe're gonna execute that script, so we're\ngonna come up here and click execute.\n\n391\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.220\nPlease input process name.\n\n392\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.190\nWe gotta put in a process name.\n\n393\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.310\nNow, most of us will do something\nlike what I'm about to do,\n\n394\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.770\nwhich is, process name is Notepad, right?\n\n395\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.110\nSo, let me just do Notepad.\n\n396\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.615\nWell, when you do that, you get an error.\n\n397\n00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:21.112\nEssentially, you get no input back.\n\n398\n00:20:21.112 --> 00:20:22.656\nIt's not really an error,\nyou just don't get anything.\n\n399\n00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:27.060\nThe process name includes the .exe, which\nwe often leave off and forget when we\n\n400\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.430\nare shorting things, and just doing\nthem shorthand like from a run line.\n\n401\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.130\nLet me do Notepad, and that'll spin it up.\n\n402\n00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:38.262\nThe .exe is implied in a command\nline like the run tool, right?\n\n403\n00:20:38.262 --> 00:20:41.156\nBut it's not implied here,\nwe need the full process name.\n\n404\n00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:46.789\nSo when we do this, what we actually need\nto do, right, is we need to actually\n\n405\n00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:52.447\ngo in, and we need to actually put in\nnotepad.exe, if that's our process.\n\n406\n00:20:52.447 --> 00:20:54.834\nNow, once we've done that,\nwe do actually get the output.\n\n407\n00:20:54.834 --> 00:20:57.232\nSo, you just gotta know the tricks, right?\n\n408\n00:20:57.232 --> 00:21:00.270\nYou gotta understand when you're\nusing a script like this.\n\n409\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.610\nThat you got to put the full process\nname in, and then you can see,\n\n410\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.550\nwe got the process id, we got the panel\naccount, the executable path, which is\n\n411\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.460\nobviously important if we're gonna be\nforensically examining what's going on.\n\n412\n00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.090\nWe've got the working set, now, could I\nhave called a bunch of other properties,\n\n413\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.510\ndetailed out a bunch of other stuff here?\n\n414\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.960\nYeah, this is just a very\nsimple working script.\n\n415\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.790\nBut this is just to give you a taste of\nthe idea that there's more than one way to\n\n416\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.700\ngo after information forensically\nin a Windows system.\n\n417\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.300\nPowerShell is a legitimate and\nvaluable set of tools and\n\n418\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.120\nfunctions that can be used.\n\n419\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.870\nWe can run any executable\nthrough PowerShell.\n\n420\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.540\nIf you wanna do an ipconfig,\nyou can run that through PowerShell.\n\n421\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.680\nYou wanna ping,\nyou can run that through PowerShell.\n\n422\n00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.900\nPowerShell will execute any executable in\nthe system the same way other tools do.\n\n423\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.750\nIt's just a shell that's got\nadditional capabilities,\n\n424\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.270\nbecause it supports a scripting language.\n\n425\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.310\nAnd that's what PowerShell is, right?\n\n426\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.030\nIt's a command line shell that\nsupports a scripting language.\n\n427\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.072\nAnd so, as a result,\nit gives us incredible flexibility, but\n\n428\n00:21:57.072 --> 00:21:58.378\nincredible power.\n\n429\n00:21:58.378 --> 00:22:00.754\nBut we have to know how\nto wield that power.\n\n430\n00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:02.991\nPower for good, as opposed to evil,\nmy young Padawan, right?\n\n431\n00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:04.847\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love the quote, by the way,\n\n432\n00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:05.347\nout in the hallway.\n\n433\n00:22:05.347 --> 00:22:07.769\nI was walking down to get coffee, you\nguys have all the quotes up on the wall.\n\n434\n00:22:07.769 --> 00:22:08.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n435\n00:22:08.947 --> 00:22:10.325\n&gt;&gt; And Yoda is up there, right?\n\n436\n00:22:10.325 --> 00:22:11.685\n&gt;&gt; They call it the wall of inspiration.\n\n437\n00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:12.287\n&gt;&gt; Do or do not, there is no try.\n\n438\n00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:13.680\nI love that quote.\n\n439\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.234\n&gt;&gt; There is no try.\n\n440\n00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:19.860\n&gt;&gt; That and the shirt that my\ngirls got me went to, what is it?\n\n441\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.900\nThat cut, not a cut, yeah, no, no.\n\n442\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.890\nCut no, universal.\n\n443\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.450\nUniversal Studios, we have season passes,\n\n444\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.470\nas everybody who lives in\nFlorida probably does.\n\n445\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.909\nAnd when my girls were younger, we would\ngo, literally, it was every eight weeks,\n\n446\n00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:33.186\nmy wife would be in the car with us,\nall right, come on,\n\n447\n00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.460\nwe're going to Disney World.\n\n448\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.433\nGot to get our money out of those passes,\nright?\n\n449\n00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:37.946\nCuz when you spend a million dollars,\n\n450\n00:22:37.946 --> 00:22:40.084\nyou gotta get back a million\ndollars plus something.\n\n451\n00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:42.670\nSo, at one point, they went, and\nI don't think I was with them,\n\n452\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.968\nthey bought me a shirt, the Yoda shirt-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n453\n00:22:44.968 --> 00:22:48.052\n&gt;&gt; They got a whole bunch, but this one is\nYoda, little Yoda, he's about this big,\n\n454\n00:22:48.052 --> 00:22:50.168\nand it's reaching out,\nit's pull my finger, right?\n\n455\n00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:52.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, my Yoda shirt that I wear every so\n\n456\n00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.497\noften, not when I'm on camera though,\nbecause that would not be appropriate for\n\n457\n00:22:56.497 --> 00:22:58.350\nbeing on camera here with you guys.\n\n458\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.790\nBut looking at PowerShell, using it,\n\n459\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.250\nthinking about how to use it,\nreally valuable additional set of tools.\n\n460\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.950\nNow, again,\nit's gonna be a bit of a journey, right,\n\n461\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.860\nto get you guys to the point where you can\nreally use PowerShell to do a lot of this.\n\n462\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.770\nThe value of tools that we've looked at,\nthe value of tools that are built in.\n\n463\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.120\nThe value, and you even mentioned this,\nwhen we talked about system internals, and\n\n464\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.652\nthe tools center.\n\n465\n00:23:18.652 --> 00:23:19.540\nYou were, yeah,\n\n466\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.010\nyou could really understand why Windows or\nMicrosoft went out and acquired them.\n\n467\n00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:27.630\nRight, because of just the genius of Mark\nRosinovich, and the people that work for\n\n468\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.030\nhim that wrote a lot of these tools,\nalthough, he did the majority of the work,\n\n469\n00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.640\nand continues to be,\nbecause he's lead architect and\n\n470\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.390\nengineer now at Microsoft after\nthe acquisition several years ago.\n\n471\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.350\nBut the genius of being able to figure out\nhow this stuff works incorporated into\n\n472\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.182\ntools, and use the functionality,\n\n473\n00:23:43.182 --> 00:23:46.195\nlike what we see in PowerShell,\nbut in a graphical interface\n\n474\n00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:50.061\nto give you The ability to do this quickly\nis really what these tools offer us.\n\n475\n00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.480\nForensics is not always about, hey, what's\nthe quickest path to get the job done?\n\n476\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.090\nIt's about what's the most\neffective tool for you to use.\n\n477\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.290\nIf you're comfortable using PowerShell,\ngo out and write the scripts and do that.\n\n478\n00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.140\nBut if you're more comfortable using,\n\n479\n00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.720\nclick through tools in the GUI that\nsomebody's already compiled, use them.\n\n480\n00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.590\nBut the thing you have to be aware\nof that we keep talking about is\n\n481\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.280\nyou gotta get educated on the tool.\n\n482\n00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.970\nYou gotta know how it works, you gotta\nknow the ins and outs, the intricacies.\n\n483\n00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.650\nYou gotta understand\nwhat you're gonna get.\n\n484\n00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.160\nYou gotta understand what you're not gonna\nget, and you gotta understand what is and\n\n485\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.980\nis not acceptable as\noutput from that tool.\n\n486\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.300\nIn other words, knowledge becomes the key,\nessential thing that unlocks,\n\n487\n00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.580\nright, the availability and\nusage for that tool.\n\n488\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.760\nIt's very, very important for you to\nhave knowledge what you have to use.\n\n489\n00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.674\nYou can't just deploy a tool,\ncuz somebody said it's a good idea, and\n\n490\n00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:36.390\nunderstand that it will or will not work.\n\n491\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:40.140\nYou gotta go in and really read up on the\ntool, understand what's going on with it.\n\n492\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.630\nMake sure you know it and\nunderstand how to use it.\n\n493\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.300\nLet's go back, I wanna talk about\nthe registry a little bit more.\n\n494\n00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.856\nWe've been in here,\nplaying around with a bunch of stuff.\n\n495\n00:24:48.856 --> 00:24:52.193\nI know at a prior point in time, I pointed\nout to you, and I've got a really cool\n\n496\n00:24:52.193 --> 00:24:55.754\ndemo set up for you, by the way, you guys\nare gonna love, you're gonna love this.\n\n497\n00:24:55.754 --> 00:24:56.912\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; Although you've seen this one.\n\n498\n00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:58.620\nYou guys are gonna love this as well.\n\n499\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.060\nI'm gonna show you how to\ntranslate the binary for\n\n500\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.150\nthe check down time in the reg key into\nan actual value that you can use, and\n\n501\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.110\nsee how the system, or when the last\ntime the system was shutdown.\n\n502\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.650\nWe're gonna take a look\nat that in just a minute.\n\n503\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.240\nGotta little BBS script for you,\nthat you're gonna see and how to do that.\n\n504\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.000\nBut I know I've shown you before what\nthe and let me do it this way, actually,\n\n505\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.450\nnow that we're thinking about it here.\n\n506\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:25.420\nI know that I've shown you before\nwhat the various reg keys are,\n\n507\n00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.630\nand I know that we've talked about this.\n\n508\n00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.810\nCan we go full-screen, just so\nthey can see this a little bit better?\n\n509\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.200\nWe've been through this,\nand I've talked about this.\n\n510\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.670\nI just wanna remind you of them,\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, CURRENT_USER,\n\n511\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.890\nLOCAL_MACHINE, USERS, CURRENT_CONFIG.\n\n512\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.920\nThis is out of Windows 10, right?\n\n513\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.920\nRight, they're the same,\nthey just don't really change.\n\n514\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.234\nRight, but make sure you know this.\n\n515\n00:25:41.234 --> 00:25:42.602\nNo, go back back, please, full screen,\n\n516\n00:25:42.602 --> 00:25:44.470\nI wanna talk about them while\nwe're going through these.\n\n517\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:49.227\nHKEY users, right, making sure we\nunderstand that all actively loaded user\n\n518\n00:25:49.227 --> 00:25:51.540\nprofiles are gonna exist in here.\n\n519\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.818\nWe've done a demo and shown you this\nbefore, wanna make sure you know that.\n\n520\n00:25:54.818 --> 00:25:58.690\nUnder HKEY_CURRENT_USERS, right,\njust up here kinda out of order,\n\n521\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.890\nmaking sure we know the profile for\ncurrently logged on users is there.\n\n522\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.910\nJust as a little distinction of a piece of\ninformation alone is incredibly important.\n\n523\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.860\nAll user profiles on the system,\nwhether actively logged in or\n\n524\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.700\nnot, under HKEY users.\n\n525\n00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.370\nCurrently logged on user with\ncurrent profile, under current user.\n\n526\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.890\nHKEY local machine, configuration\ninformation for the system, right?\n\n527\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.070\nSo, making sure we know that, making\nsure as we've been in and out of, and\n\n528\n00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:26.175\ndemoing what's there, and know what to\nlook for where is gonna be important.\n\n529\n00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:29.758\nHKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG down here,\nhardware profile used during startup,\n\n530\n00:26:29.758 --> 00:26:32.897\nwe want to make sure we understand\nwhat kind of hardware is running,\n\n531\n00:26:32.897 --> 00:26:35.234\nwhen it's running, and\nunder what conditions.\n\n532\n00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:39.100\nWe're gonna look current config,\nclasses root, which is up at the top here,\n\n533\n00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.154\nthis is gonna have config information for\nwhich application is used to open what.\n\n534\n00:26:43.154 --> 00:26:46.783\nSo, if I wanna see whether malware's\nremapped application variables,\n\n535\n00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:49.124\nI'm gonna look in\nthe HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and\n\n536\n00:26:49.124 --> 00:26:53.330\nexamine information in there to understand\nwhat's happening with it, right?\n\n537\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.610\nSo, we've gotta make sure we\nunderstand where things are, and\n\n538\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.290\nunderstand how to read through\nthe information in the registry.\n\n539\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.600\nIt's gonna be very important\nto us to understand that, and\n\n540\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.410\nmake sure we know what's\nin each of those keys.\n\n541\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.420\nIf you're planning on taking\nthe CHFI exam, would be good for\n\n542\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.390\nyou to have a sense what's\nin each of those keys.\n\n543\n00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.330\nWe have the little explanation,\nessentially,\n\n544\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.190\none sentence summary like I just gave you,\nincluded in the show notes.\n\n545\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.590\nMake sure you take a look at that,\nmake sure you go back study that,\n\n546\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.100\nit's gonna be helpful information for you.\n\n547\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.320\nAll right, I promised you a little demo\non how to take the shutdown time value\n\n548\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.050\nsitting in the registry in binary and\nconvert that, right?\n\n549\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.755\nI'm gonna do that with my eyes closed.\n\n550\n00:27:29.755 --> 00:27:32.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That will fun.\n\n551\n00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Gonna use the power of the force.\n\n552\n00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n553\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.690\n&gt;&gt; So first we're gonna go full screen, so\nI'm gonna use my power right now, nice,\n\n554\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.050\nsee I didn't do this yet, right?\n\n555\n00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.000\n&gt;&gt; So, wasn't my power is so powerful,\n\n556\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.370\nI didn't have to make the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n557\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.610\n&gt;&gt; I didn't have to make the fig, I just\npoint it at the screen and there we go.\n\n558\n00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.190\nIt's that voice command that we've set up.\n\n559\n00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.980\nIt's natural speak here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n560\n00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.360\nSo, we're gonna go and\ntake a look at the registry key, right?\n\n561\n00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.260\nAnd let me just zoom in, so\nyou can see this real quick,\n\n562\n00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.540\nI want to show you what key we're on,\nas we often do down here.\n\n563\n00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.212\nYou could see HQ local machine system\ncurrent control set control Windows.\n\n564\n00:28:04.212 --> 00:28:10.497\nAnd in that key right over there,\nwe see shut down time, and\n\n565\n00:28:10.497 --> 00:28:16.046\nwhen we open this up,\nwe see a binary value for that.\n\n566\n00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:22.098\nThe C2 27 CC 2A EF 4B\nD2 01 is going to be-\n\n567\n00:28:22.098 --> 00:28:24.138\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n568\n00:28:24.138 --> 00:28:26.719\n&gt;&gt; That was the reg binary key, and so,\n\n569\n00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:31.399\nit's gonna be put in in a value that\nallows us to interact that way.\n\n570\n00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:34.601\nWe've got some other additional garbage\nthere as well, but it's binary value.\n\n571\n00:28:34.601 --> 00:28:38.340\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty [LAUGH] it's\nspeaking Japanese to us.\n\n572\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH ] Exactly, please,\nsit down enjoy yourself c2, enjoy.\n\n573\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:47.020\nSo, what I'm gonna do I'm gonna show\nyou how to take this value, and\n\n574\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.210\nI'd actually get something\nout of it that makes sense,\n\n575\n00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.120\nbecause that is actually gonna give\nus information that's important.\n\n576\n00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.070\nBut it's in a form that most\nhuman beings don't know,\n\n577\n00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.020\nbecause most people don't\nwalk around speaking binary.\n\n578\n00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.542\nAt least not on regular basis, anyway-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n579\n00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:05.311\n&gt;&gt; But then he couldn't figure out how to\n\n580\n00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:06.919\nget a norm that actually matched.\n\n581\n00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:08.758\nRight, if you remember the red thing and\nthe gold thing,\n\n582\n00:29:08.758 --> 00:29:10.060\nI don't know what that was.\n\n583\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.128\nAnyway, so, if we could go back,\nlet's take a look.\n\n584\n00:29:12.128 --> 00:29:15.344\nI have a little script that\nI have created for you,\n\n585\n00:29:15.344 --> 00:29:18.036\nlet me show you what\nit is here real quick.\n\n586\n00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:26.470\nAnd this script right here\ncalled last logon right there.\n\n587\n00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.630\nAccredited is the text file, and then of\ncourse, let's go and save it off as a VBS.\n\n588\n00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.860\nAnd then tell people to use it\nbecause it won't hurt anything, right?\n\n589\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.650\nIt's safe to run a VBS script.\n\n590\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.740\nSo, last logon,\nwhen you take a look in here.\n\n591\n00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.800\nWhat it does is it goes in and it outputs,\n\n592\n00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.420\nI just showed you more or\nless what the output will be, right?\n\n593\n00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.800\nSo this goes in, takes a look at this,\n\n594\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.670\ngives us information about what\nthe reg d word values will be.\n\n595\n00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:57.230\nAnd so, when I run this,\nwhat we get is the following.\n\n596\n00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.950\nLet's just go ahead and\nopen that sucker up.\n\n597\n00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.490\nAnd what do we get right\nthere using the script host?\n\n598\n00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.620\nLet me just bring that up here,\nand let's zoom in.\n\n599\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.880\nWhen I run that,\n\n600\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.370\nthat value that's sitting in binary\nactually equals that right there.\n\n601\n00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.752\nShutdown time is 12/1, meaning the machine\nhas been running since December 1st.\n\n602\n00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:20.938\nAnd if you're watching this now,\nand 20/20, boy, it's been on for\n\n603\n00:30:20.938 --> 00:30:22.141\na long time, right?\n\n604\n00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:23.730\nIt's been on for a while.\n\n605\n00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.000\nFour years, nonstop.\n\n606\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.690\nIt's amazing what those windows\nmachines will do, right?\n\n607\n00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:32.630\nSo, you could see that by running a script\nthat converts that out for us, it actually\n\n608\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.570\nallows us to be able to read that binary\ninformation, and shows us what it does.\n\n609\n00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.570\nThe magic in the script, and\nhow we actually make that happen.\n\n610\n00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.360\nThat's not hard to do, but\nyou have to know a little bit, obviously,\n\n611\n00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.470\nabout the scripting language, a little bit\nabout how to convert binary values, right?\n\n612\n00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.560\nAnd be able to run a solution that does\nthat, but you can look up how to do that,\n\n613\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.190\nyou can find out how to do it,\nit's not very hard to do.\n\n614\n00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.090\nBut again, we use scripts like\nthis as part of a toolkit\n\n615\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.800\nto be able to see how long\nthe system's been up.\n\n616\n00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.890\nNow, that's if I convert it\nright out of the registry.\n\n617\n00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.020\nWhat if I just wanna go\ninto the command line and\n\n618\n00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.820\nessentially figure out the same thing?\n\n619\n00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:11.480\nWell, we have a tool called\nuptime that can be run.\n\n620\n00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.400\nAgain, it's built right in to\nthe Windows operating system, so\n\n621\n00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.560\nif we read the help file on the command\nshell, we would see that uptime is there.\n\n622\n00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.580\nYou could see uptime is\nsitting right there.\n\n623\n00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:25.160\nIf I use uptime- I can get information\n\n624\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.850\nthat tells me it doesn't print it out and\nsay whatever the date is.\n\n625\n00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.800\nBut it says it's been up for so\nmany days, hours, minutes, whatever.\n\n626\n00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.450\nAnd again,\nwe can get the same kind of information\n\n627\n00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.250\njust by doing it from\na different perspective.\n\n628\n00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.020\nSo, I can get this information\nfrom a variety of different place.\n\n629\n00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.310\nIt's really just a matter of how\nI wanna grab it, what I wanna do,\n\n630\n00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.620\nwhat I wanted it to look like.\n\n631\n00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.346\nBut whether I create a script, whether I\nused up time, I can do it the same way,\n\n632\n00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:49.714\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n633\n00:31:49.714 --> 00:31:51.710\nSo, it's just a question of understanding.\n\n634\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.810\nHow that information is listed and\nwhere I can find it.\n\n635\n00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.912\nThere's also a way for\n\n636\n00:31:55.912 --> 00:31:59.440\nus to go look at all the wireless SIDs\nthat have been set up in the system.\n\n637\n00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.130\nThere's a registry key that'll\nlet you go in and do that.\n\n638\n00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.680\nWe can drill down and take a look at\nevery wireless profile that's in there.\n\n639\n00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.440\nAgain, a lot of times you'll connect\nto one or more wireless systems.\n\n640\n00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.680\nAnd you may not see evidence of that when\nyou go to forensically exam the machine on\n\n641\n00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.060\nthe surface, but\nthat information is in the registry.\n\n642\n00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.120\nSo think about that, we can gather that.\n\n643\n00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.760\nWhat about USB devices that have\nbeen hooked up to the system?\n\n644\n00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.550\nWe could see a list of all of those,\nand go into the device classes and\n\n645\n00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.490\nsee where they are.\n\n646\n00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.060\nWhat about mounted devices, hard drives?\n\n647\n00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.430\nWe could take a look at all of\nthose as well, see what's there.\n\n648\n00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.310\nAll these things exist in the registry.\n\n649\n00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.840\nAnd the keys for these are on the show\nnotes, we've given them to you.\n\n650\n00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.120\nThere's also a really interesting\none called the user assist key.\n\n651\n00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.410\nI wanna show you this and just have you\ntake a look at this really quickly.\n\n652\n00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.810\nSo if we can go back into the registry,\nwe just go in here.\n\n653\n00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.250\nWe're gonna go into HKEY_CURRENT_USER,\nso we're gonna switch out here.\n\n654\n00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.880\nGive me a second to kinda clean this up.\n\n655\n00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.800\nSo we're gonna go in HK_CURRENT_USER.\n\n656\n00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.720\nAnd we're going to go in, and\nwe're going to go to Software.\n\n657\n00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.350\nSo we're going to drill down here.\n\n658\n00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.450\nAnd we're go to Microsoft and Windows, so\n\n659\n00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.800\nlet's just come down here to,\nwhere's Microsoft?\n\n660\n00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.480\nThere's Microsoft, and going to go down\nto Windows down towards the bottom.\n\n661\n00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.940\nWe've been in the Windows and\nT key before.\n\n662\n00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.960\nWe're going to go into Windows now.\n\n663\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.170\nCouple of different keys in\nthere we've got to look at.\n\n664\n00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.299\nWe're gonna go to Windows,\nwe're gonna go to current version.\n\n665\n00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:19.897\nAnd under current version\nwe're gonna go into Explorer.\n\n666\n00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:23.972\nAnd under Explorer, we're gonna\ncome down and go to User Assist.\n\n667\n00:33:23.972 --> 00:33:25.237\nAll the way at the bottom.\n\n668\n00:33:25.237 --> 00:33:27.559\nNow, this is gonna be really cool.\n\n669\n00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:29.360\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go to User Assist.\n\n670\n00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.760\nWe've got two profiles, or\ntwo grids here, that represent users.\n\n671\n00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.700\nLet's just drill in for\na second so you can see those.\n\n672\n00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:41.630\nAnd each one of those represents\na user that has been logged in.\n\n673\n00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.150\nWe can see that one.\n\n674\n00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.020\nWe can see this one here.\n\n675\n00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.790\nWe can go in under count\nin either of these.\n\n676\n00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.289\nAnd we can see that we have just a,\n\n677\n00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:52.463\ncan we go full screen because we\nare kind of blocking what we are doing?\n\n678\n00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:57.318\nWe have a ridiculous amount of information\nsitting in here under each of these,\n\n679\n00:33:57.318 --> 00:33:59.570\nbut what we see is just random stuff.\n\n680\n00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.670\nIf I just move this over,\nso you can see this, right?\n\n681\n00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.000\nWe got random stuff in here that doesn't\nreally make a lot of sense, right,\n\n682\n00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.040\nwhat's Bbor.rkr.\n\n683\n00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:15.074\nRight, for instance, it's this one\nright here, what's ABGRCNQ.RKR, right?\n\n684\n00:34:15.074 --> 00:34:21.070\nWhat these are are ROT 13\nreferences that have been shifted\n\n685\n00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:27.010\nto actually mask the information\nthat we have been currently using.\n\n686\n00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.840\nAnd programs we've opened and\nthings that we're doing.\n\n687\n00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.030\nAnd what we can do is we can take this and\n\n688\n00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.540\nwe can actually understand how to decode\nthis and see what this may refer to.\n\n689\n00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.040\nSo we could take something like this,\nright?\n\n690\n00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.940\nAnd we can actually go in and\n\n691\n00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.630\nwe can run it through a decoder and\nwhen we run it through a decoder.\n\n692\n00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.800\nWe can actually find out information\nabout what's been used by the, User.\n\n693\n00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.110\nAnd so, if we just scroll over,\n\n694\n00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.250\nyou can see there's just\nrandom values there, right?\n\n695\n00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.550\nAnd so, let's just, well,\nlet's choose one here, all right.\n\n696\n00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.140\nSo, let's go in.\n\n697\n00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.779\nLet's take this information.\n\n698\n00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:07.620\nRight there.\n\n699\n00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.700\nLet's just copy that.\n\n700\n00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.080\nSo give me just a second\nto kind of do that.\n\n701\n00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.150\nLet's cancel that.\n\n702\n00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.090\nLet's just leave that highlighted so\nwe can see it.\n\n703\n00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.190\nLet's come back over here.\n\n704\n00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.559\nLet's come over here.\n\n705\n00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:23.389\nAnd what we're gonna do is\njust paste that in there.\n\n706\n00:35:25.954 --> 00:35:28.650\nDo an encrypt, decrypt,\ngive me just one second.\n\n707\n00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.380\nYou know what?\nI grabbed the wrong value,\n\n708\n00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.489\nhold on just one second.\n\n709\n00:35:33.489 --> 00:35:35.440\nYeah, I grabbed the right idea,\nbut I grabbed the wrong value.\n\n710\n00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.960\nJust one second,\nI didn't realize what I was doing there.\n\n711\n00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.898\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n712\n00:35:39.898 --> 00:35:47.280\nAnd when we grab this, Come on, behave.\n\n713\n00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.760\nThere we go.\n\n714\n00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.580\nGrab this, let's try this one more time.\n\n715\n00:35:55.564 --> 00:35:56.670\nIt actually works worked that time.\n\n716\n00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.751\nLook at that.\n\n717\n00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:00.820\nI was actually able to grab that and\nview the whole, there we go.\n\n718\n00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.270\nI didn't grab the whole thing, I forgot.\n\n719\n00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.240\nI didn't realize I didn't\ngo all the way across.\n\n720\n00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.750\nSo when I grab the whole thing, and\n\n721\n00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.516\nyou'll notice that it's the last part\nactually that gives me the executable.\n\n722\n00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:11.780\nBut when I grab the whole thing and\nlook at it, what you'll see, and\n\n723\n00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.910\nlet me zoom in cuz it's kinda hard to\ntell otherwise what's going on here.\n\n724\n00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:18.120\nBut what I did is,\nI grabbed entire referenceable string.\n\n725\n00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.350\nWe'll go back in the registry\nin a second and you'll see it.\n\n726\n00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.820\nAnd when I translate that string,\n\n727\n00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.530\nwhat I actually see is that that\nstring equates to mspaint.exe.\n\n728\n00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.550\nIf you remember, you had given me\nthe chart when we did the raid discussion,\n\n729\n00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.540\nand I had opened it up in Paint.\n\n730\n00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.265\nAnd I left it running and\nit was just sitting there, and\n\n731\n00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:37.555\nI haven't started the machine,\nright, since that demo.\n\n732\n00:36:37.555 --> 00:36:40.085\nSo mspaint.exe was the program used.\n\n733\n00:36:40.085 --> 00:36:41.001\nAnd I can see a reference to it.\n\n734\n00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:44.385\nBut when you look at that,\ncould you tell that that's mspaint.exe?\n\n735\n00:36:44.385 --> 00:36:47.040\nI mean, you could guess, but\nthere would be no way to know.\n\n736\n00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.070\nWe essentially take this information.\n\n737\n00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:55.125\nWe encrypt it in the registry to hide it\nso you can't tell what the programs are,\n\n738\n00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:58.980\nbut you can decrypt it if you know\nwhat the encryption sequence was.\n\n739\n00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.145\nIt's a ROT-13 cipher, so\nwe're substituting essentially and\n\n740\n00:37:02.145 --> 00:37:03.144\nmoving through, and\n\n741\n00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:06.820\nyou just have to run it backwards\nthrough an encryptor/decryptor tool.\n\n742\n00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.140\nThis one happens to be online, right, so\nyou could just go right in decode.org.\n\n743\n00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.500\nAnd as they say here,\nas seen on Mr Robot, so there you go.\n\n744\n00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.520\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff.\n\n745\n00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.230\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff.\n\n746\n00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.640\nSo you can actually go in and\nyou could just simply drop the string in.\n\n747\n00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.320\nAnd when you do that,\nit will tell you whatever it was.\n\n748\n00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.040\nYou could take any of those strings,\nand you can decode them and\n\n749\n00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.270\nfind out, based on this,\nwhat somebody has run as a program.\n\n750\n00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.266\nAnd so if you look here, you can see that\nright there, I just took the whole string.\n\n751\n00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:38.017\nAnd the reg binary key value, and I'm\nable to say okay that one was MS Paint.\n\n752\n00:37:38.017 --> 00:37:38.928\nWhen I go through here,\n\n753\n00:37:38.928 --> 00:37:42.150\nI can actually figure out every program\nthat's been executed on the machine.\n\n754\n00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.370\n&gt;&gt; That's a whole lot easier than\nwriting a decoder from scratch,\n\n755\n00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.800\nwhich I've done before.\n\n756\n00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.440\n&gt;&gt; It is!\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna drop\n\n757\n00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.936\nit in a website, from now on.\n\n758\n00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:50.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n759\n00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.230\n&gt;&gt; There's always a solution.\n\n760\n00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.590\nYou just have to look for it.\n\n761\n00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.901\n&gt;&gt; Someone has already\ninvented that wheel.\n\n762\n00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:55.880\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Because you've got to think about it.\n\n763\n00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.120\nSomebody sat around and\nsaid, okay, it's in there.\n\n764\n00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.170\nI wanna know what it is.\n\n765\n00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I've got to figure it out.\n\n766\n00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.290\nYou're not the first person\nwho looked at it and\n\n767\n00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.520\nsaid, wouldn't it be nice to know, right?\n\n768\n00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.440\nSo it's definitely there.\n\n769\n00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.320\nBut we can go through, literally there\nare, I don't know how many entries there\n\n770\n00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.800\nare here, but if you scroll down there's\nseveral of them, as you can see, right?\n\n771\n00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.870\nIf we took another one here,\n\n772\n00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.450\nlet's just take this one real quick and\nkind of see what this is.\n\n773\n00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.970\nAnd just see what this one looks like,\nlet's cancel out of that real quick,\n\n774\n00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.061\nlet's just go grab this one.\n\n775\n00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:31.333\nDo that, let's just do that.\n\n776\n00:38:31.333 --> 00:38:33.852\nRight, so that's iecv.e.\n\n777\n00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:36.719\nIt's one of the tools from\nthe sys internals area,\n\n778\n00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:40.090\nthat's the one that I did\nthat's the cookie viewer.\n\n779\n00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.750\nSo that one was the tool\nthat we demoed for\n\n780\n00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.230\nyou where we looked at all the cookies.\n\n781\n00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.390\nThat's the IE cookie viewer tool that\nI ran for you out of of the SI Share\n\n782\n00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.994\nthat I've set up on my machine just to\ndo all the demos for the system tools.\n\n783\n00:38:51.994 --> 00:38:52.714\nYou can see that translate.\n\n784\n00:38:52.714 --> 00:38:56.816\nNow something I know that you don't know,\nright, about these strings.\n\n785\n00:38:56.816 --> 00:38:59.370\nBecause they're in that format\nwith the drive letter colon,\n\n786\n00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.800\nI know that that is an executable path.\n\n787\n00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.600\nSo I can zero in on ones that I\nknow are sitting in the directory.\n\n788\n00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.040\nI obviously don't know what that is,\nbut in my mind I can work ahead and go,\n\n789\n00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.540\nwell, yeah 13 letters in\nthe alphabet up from c is p, so\n\n790\n00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.900\nI know it's gotta be c something, right?\n\n791\n00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.040\nI mean, you can do this in your head,\nbut the point is it would be hard for\n\n792\n00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.370\nyou to sit there and\nactually run through everything.\n\n793\n00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.640\nSomething small you kinda\ndecrypt on your own, right?\n\n794\n00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.660\nBut for the big stuff,\nyou wanna work it through.\n\n795\n00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.380\nBut the logic of it is,\nyou can go into the registry.\n\n796\n00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.840\nAnd literally, you can track through\neverything that's been run, and\n\n797\n00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.430\nyou can see it all.\n\n798\n00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:33.270\nThere's gotta be, I don't know, maybe 70\nentries in here, something like that for\n\n799\n00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.370\nall the executables.\n\n800\n00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:37.778\nAnd you can do this for every user\nthat's been logged on by the way, right.\n\n801\n00:39:37.778 --> 00:39:43.896\nSo if I go in here, and\nI take a look at this one.\n\n802\n00:39:43.896 --> 00:39:45.893\nLet's go in,\nlet's just grab this real quick.\n\n803\n00:39:45.893 --> 00:39:49.958\nThis is probably under Nate's profile,\nI'm thinking, so\n\n804\n00:39:49.958 --> 00:39:52.520\nwe don't know what we're gonna get.\n\n805\n00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.336\nThat could be something that not\nbe a good idea to do in public.\n\n806\n00:39:55.336 --> 00:40:00.596\nBut we're gonna trust, we're gonna trust\nTo the fact that he's behaving himself.\n\n807\n00:40:00.596 --> 00:40:03.465\nBut it's in the p format, so\nwe know it's a c drive reference,\n\n808\n00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:06.570\nthere's something in the c drive\nthat he was referencing, right?\n\n809\n00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.790\nAnd we can easily figure out what this is,\nright?\n\n810\n00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.570\nGo here, cross your fingers, right?\n\n811\n00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.020\nAnd what do we got?\n\n812\n00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.400\nThat's just the Mozilla Firefox link,\nso that was him going out and\n\n813\n00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.070\nprobably just looking at something\non Firefox, probably when he was\n\n814\n00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.730\ninstalling the browser, setting everything\nup, and making sure it was working.\n\n815\n00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.409\nThat's what that looks like right there.\n\n816\n00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:26.966\nIt's essentially just that.\n\n817\n00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:30.060\nSo we can go in and\ndecrypt all of these and\n\n818\n00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.840\nlook at them by using a site like\ndecode.org and we would do this literally.\n\n819\n00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.300\nYou would sit there and\nyou would go through and\n\n820\n00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.670\nyou would actually examine these and\nsay, okay these programs have been run.\n\n821\n00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.890\nWe know that these programs were\nexecuted at this point in time and\n\n822\n00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.240\nwe could go take a look.\n\n823\n00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.490\nWe have one more we wanna show you.\n\n824\n00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.499\nI know we're already\na little bit overtime, but\n\n825\n00:40:48.499 --> 00:40:50.022\nI'm just not gonna stop talking so.\n\n826\n00:40:50.022 --> 00:40:51.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just gonna have to live with it.\n\n827\n00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.800\nSo one more which I think will also be of\ninterest to you around this theme MRU,\n\n828\n00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.950\nright, most recently used.\n\n829\n00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.262\nLet's take a look at the Explorer Key and\ngo in and take a look for that.\n\n830\n00:41:00.262 --> 00:41:05.946\nCurrent Users Software Microsoft and\nwe're in Windows current version so\n\n831\n00:41:05.946 --> 00:41:12.000\nlet's just go up under Explorer and\ninstead of user assist, let's go in here.\n\n832\n00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.100\nLet's go up just a little bit,\nand run MRU, right?\n\n833\n00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.420\nSo right here, what do we see?\n\n834\n00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.470\nWe can see in here,\nwe just move this over so\n\n835\n00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.610\nthat you can see it a little bit better,\n,just so we can see what's on there.\n\n836\n00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.320\nWhat do we see?\n\n837\n00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.130\nWhat we see is we see a listing, right?\n\n838\n00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.690\nAnd we see all the stuff that\nwe have run from the run line,\n\n839\n00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.530\nmost recently used on the run line.\n\n840\n00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.220\nAll of these commands have been run\non the run line on this machine.\n\n841\n00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.900\nAnd I can see reference to them.\n\n842\n00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.450\nThough I can go in and\nactually see the history of the run line,\n\n843\n00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.260\nnot the command line, not DOS key,\nbut from the run line.\n\n844\n00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.120\nSo, I do Windows key letter r, and\nI start typing commands in there, right.\n\n845\n00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.910\nI keep a history,\na track of what's going on in there,\n\n846\n00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.272\nthis key allows us to see that.\n\n847\n00:41:58.272 --> 00:42:00.800\nSo again, I can go back and\nI can see what people have run,\n\n848\n00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.400\nhave they connected to another\nmachine using the UNC.\n\n849\n00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.630\nHave they actually executed\nsome sort of program?\n\n850\n00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.216\nI can take a look at that and\nI can see what's going on in there and\n\n851\n00:42:09.216 --> 00:42:11.737\nI can see that we tracked\nthat information.\n\n852\n00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:17.280\nThe reg key for that right down here\nat the bottom right Hkeycurrent_user,\n\n853\n00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.106\nsoftware as you can see.\n\n854\n00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:23.501\nMichael can we go full-screen cause you\ncan't see that otherwise Microsoft Windows\n\n855\n00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:26.210\ncurrent version explorer run MRU, right?\n\n856\n00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.200\nRun most recently used.\n\n857\n00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.420\nThat's the run line, right?\n\n858\n00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.370\nMost recently used\ncommands on the run line.\n\n859\n00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:32.900\nSo we can take a look at that.\n\n860\n00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.890\nAll of this stuff,\nremember is stuff that we wanna capture.\n\n861\n00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.200\nThis is not volatile data.\n\n862\n00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.792\nThis stuff will be in a disk copy bit\nstring copy of the disk because it's in\n\n863\n00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:42.768\nthe registry.\n\n864\n00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:45.722\nI'll be able to look at the stuff\noffline I don't have to go in and\n\n865\n00:42:45.722 --> 00:42:49.187\ncapture it dynamically while the system\nis running before I power it down.\n\n866\n00:42:49.187 --> 00:42:51.917\nBut I do have to get a bit string copy of\nthe hard drive to be able to look at all\n\n867\n00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:53.070\nthis stuff all right.\n\n868\n00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.230\nAll the caching that we have done,\n\n869\n00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.210\nright, all the different\nhistory information in there.\n\n870\n00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.410\nAll that kind of stuff is obviously\ngonna be very important to us and\n\n871\n00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.750\nwe just wanna understand and be aware of\nthe fact that we do have the ability to go\n\n872\n00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.030\nin and pull all that information\ntogether if we want to and see it all.\n\n873\n00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.830\nSo, there is some interesting stuff.\n\n874\n00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:11.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n875\n00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.970\nAdam, Windows is available\ntreasure trove of\n\n876\n00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.580\ninformation about the people\nthat have been using it.\n\n877\n00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.050\nIt's keeping those things for\nease of use for\n\n878\n00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.660\nthe end user but it leaves a trail, right?\n\n879\n00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.900\nYou have a fingerprint on that machine and\nif you know where to look,\n\n880\n00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.710\nwell you can go in there and\nfind out a little bit about that user.\n\n881\n00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.490\nAnd if you're looking forensically,\nobviously you wanna gather as much\n\n882\n00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.950\ninformation as possible about someone\nthat you possibly think is a suspect or\n\n883\n00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.640\nif there is a machine itself is evidence,\n\n884\n00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.010\nyou wanna get all the evidence out of\nit as forensically soundly as possible.\n\n885\n00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.480\nAnd if you thought that was the end\nof what Windows has to offer,\n\n886\n00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.320\nwell guess what, you're sorely\nmistaken because there's a whole bevy\n\n887\n00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.950\nof extra stuff that we have to get through\nand definitely another episode coming up.\n\n888\n00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.200\nAdam, anything else we need to add\nto this episode before we sign off?\n\n889\n00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.563\n[SOUND] Going to see\nhow long I can do that.\n\n890\n00:44:01.563 --> 00:44:03.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, nothing, I'm only teasing.\n\n891\n00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.760\nNo I think we're good for now.\n\n892\n00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.050\nBut as Daniel did say, come on back,\n\n893\n00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:09.980\nwe've got some additional, even cooler\nstuff to show you if you can imagine that.\n\n894\n00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.480\nSo we're going to do another one and\n\n895\n00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.570\nwe'll be back here in just a couple\nminutes to do that for you.\n\n896\n00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, well everyone,\nthanks for joining us today, but\n\n897\n00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.330\nit looks like it's that time again for\nus to sign off.\n\n898\n00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.609\nFor ITPro TV,\nI have been your host Daniel Laurie.\n\n899\n00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.168\n&gt;&gt; And I am, who am I?\n\n900\n00:44:24.168 --> 00:44:26.822\n[CROSSTALK] I am Mr. Robot.\n\n901\n00:44:26.822 --> 00:44:27.660\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n902\n00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.866\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n903\n00:44:29.866 --> 00:44:35.870\n[MUSIC]\n\n904\n00:44:35.870 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.174\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:17.000\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.310\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.690\nin today's episode, well you guessed it,\nit's more with our CHFI series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.799\nAnd of course it would not be a day in\nCHFI without Mr. Adam Gordon at my side.\n\n8\n00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.153\nSo let's welcome him to the show,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:31.456\nHow's it going today, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:33.673\n&gt;&gt; I feel like a unicorn, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:37.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I feel all warm and cuddly and\n\n12\n00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.023\ncotton candy like.\n\n13\n00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had to have been here for\n\n14\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.000\nthat conversation.\n\n15\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.918\nBoy was it a good one!\n\n16\n00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:43.480\nIt really.\n[LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what are we doing?\n\n18\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.450\nWe're doing Windows Forensics.\n\n19\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.660\nWe'll continue talking a little\nbit more about Windows Forensics.\n\n20\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.560\nHave a rather interesting little demo,\nI'm gonna show you how to walk through.\n\n21\n00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.880\nOne of the places we often overlook\nin the Windows environment.\n\n22\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.550\nNot just Windows, by the way,\nbut in any file system.\n\n23\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.650\nThis is essentially the same concept.\n\n24\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.420\nWe're just going to demo it for\nyou in Windows.\n\n25\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.500\nBecause most of us wind up having\nto investigate Windows machines on\n\n26\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.690\na regular basis.\n\n27\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.640\nBut the idea is,\nwhat goes on when we throw something away?\n\n28\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.760\nWe've talked about the fact that\nwhen we throw something away,\n\n29\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.480\nessentially deleting it off the system,\nit's really not gone.\n\n30\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.720\nWe've had those conversations.\n\n31\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.410\nYou hopefully have a sense of that by now.\n\n32\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.012\nIf you haven't seen those shows\nyou definitely want to go back and\n\n33\n00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:25.251\ntake a look at those episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.753\nWe talked about the idea of how files are\nmanipulated in the file allocation table,\n\n35\n00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:31.166\nor master boot record, or\n\n36\n00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.462\nwhatever we're using to keep\ntrack of files on a hard drive.\n\n37\n00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:37.447\nAnd as a result we remove the pointer\nessentially, to the file but\n\n38\n00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:39.790\nthe file itself more often\nthan not is still there.\n\n39\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.310\nSame thing applies within the operating\nsystem in the recycle bin.\n\n40\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.300\nYou know, when we go to the recycle bin\nand we delete stuff, even if we throw it\n\n41\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.740\nin there and we empty the recycle bin\nit's not really removed from the system.\n\n42\n00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.920\nIt's essentially just sitting there in\nthe hard drive and can be recovered.\n\n43\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.430\nAnd so, we wanna understand that and\nhave a sense of how that can happen.\n\n44\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.230\nNow we actually have a tool, believe it or\nnot, that will do this for us.\n\n45\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.110\nI wanna show you and\nwalk through the logic of how this works.\n\n46\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.380\nSo if we go to our machine here,\nI'm gonna take a look.\n\n47\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.260\nWe have a tool called RIFIUTI version 2.\n\n48\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.860\nThis is gonna be the updated\nversion of this tool.\n\n49\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.150\nThis version will work on anything\nup to and including Windows 10.\n\n50\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.550\nThe first version of this tool works\non everything up to Windows 7.\n\n51\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.070\nSo I'm gonna demonstrate the newer\nversion of this tool for you.\n\n52\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.140\nWe're gonna do this on Windows\n10 in realtime for you.\n\n53\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190\nDaniel's gonna have the citation for\nthis, where to find it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.280\nI'm just looking at the help file that\ncomes with the tool when you download it.\n\n55\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.630\nSo when you are able to take\na look at the URL up here,\n\n56\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.740\nyou'll see it's just on the local\nhard drive for the read me.\n\n57\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.360\nSo, we're just gonna go through,\ntake a look.\n\n58\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.120\nThe tool itself runs essentially\nas a self-contained executable.\n\n59\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.530\nYou drop the executable onto the machine.\n\n60\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.330\nRun it where you want to then be able to\nsee the information in the recycle bin.\n\n61\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.170\nNow, we'll take a look at the use\nof syntax here in a second, but\n\n62\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.770\nwhat you need to do In order to be able\nto figure out how to use this tool,\n\n63\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.110\nis you have to drill into the recycle bin.\n\n64\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.600\nNow, most of us don't really go in and\ntake a look at the recycle bin on\n\n65\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.710\na regular basis, and if and when we do,\nwe tend to look at it In Windows.\n\n66\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.920\nIt looks something like\nthis more often than not.\n\n67\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.300\nWe have to show the hidden files, so we\nhave to turn on with folder file options,\n\n68\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.236\nthe explanation, or rather the exposure\nof the hidden system files.\n\n69\n00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:29.140\nSo $recycle.bin is what we see\nin newer versions of Windows.\n\n70\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.680\nWe go in here, and ignore\nthe results.xml and the executable for\n\n71\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.230\nthe tool cuz I put those in there.\n\n72\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.318\nAll you would really see is just the\nRecycle Bin folder or file icon itself.\n\n73\n00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:44.333\nIn other words, nothing in\nthe recycle bin folder traditionally.\n\n74\n00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:49.287\nBut what you actually can see is when we\nminimize it we actually have when I go in\n\n75\n00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:53.345\nthrough Windows explorer and\nstart to pull up the recycle bin.\n\n76\n00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:58.860\nSo when I change directories into dollar\nsign recycle bin, I will find that.\n\n77\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.890\nAnd let me just reverse back out here for\na second, if I do a DIR\n\n78\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.780\nyou can see that all I see are the two\nfiles result.XML and the executable.\n\n79\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.360\nBut if we know something as we hopefully\ndo about the directory List command,\n\n80\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.970\nwe wanna look at the attributes so\nwe use /a and\n\n81\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.030\nthen we actually see that there is\na hidden directory that exists.\n\n82\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.310\nCan we go fullscreen cuz you\ncan't see that otherwise.\n\n83\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.456\nThat exists with the guid that actually\nidentifies each individual user.\n\n84\n00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:34.030\nThe s-1521 whatever,\nwhatever, that is gonna be\n\n85\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.770\neach individual user's recycle bin\nunderneath the main recycle bins.\n\n86\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.370\nSo now the plot thickens a little bit.\n\n87\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.650\nAnd so\nwhat we need to do is then have this.\n\n88\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.390\nWe need to go back full\nscreen is have this.\n\n89\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.425\nWe need to have this entire\nstring running here.\n\n90\n00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.315\nSo we need to know what this is.\n\n91\n00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:57.705\nWe'll have to have that, capture that,\nbe able to note that, so that when we use\n\n92\n00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:01.595\nthe tool, we can reference the right\nrecycle bin for the right user.\n\n93\n00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:04.455\nSo what we're gonna do is take note of\nthat, so Dan you're gonna remember that\n\n94\n00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:07.105\nstring for me and\nbe able to give me that back right away.\n\n95\n00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:07.795\n&gt;&gt; It's all right here baby.\n\n96\n00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:08.905\n&gt;&gt; You got it all in there.\n\n97\n00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:11.050\nSo Dan is gonna be able to\nrecite that back to us.\n\n98\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.358\nNow we're gonna check Daniel,\n\n99\n00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.836\nand we're gonna actually minimize that so\nhe can't see it.\n\n100\n00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:17.020\nAnd then we're gonna ask him\nto give it back to us, so\n\n101\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.612\nwe're gonna come over here and\nDaniel, what's the string?\n\n102\n00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:26.383\n&gt;&gt; It is S-1-5-O-2332323095.\n\n103\n00:05:26.383 --> 00:05:28.530\n&gt;&gt; That was close.\n\n104\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Knowing that Daniel would most likely\n\n106\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.120\nnot remember the entire string I took\nthe liberty of putting it up here for us.\n\n107\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.540\nSo you can see that we would\nobviously write this down, right?\n\n108\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.580\nHaving a Daniel laying around may not be\nthe most obvious way to remember this.\n\n109\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.620\nSo we're gonna take the executable,\nriffiuti-vista.\n\n110\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.100\nAnd you could see that up there.\n\n111\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.070\nWe've got some switches associated with it\nthat we wanna use to generate some output.\n\n112\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.240\nSo the switches are gonna\nbe part of the help file.\n\n113\n00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.420\nYou're gonna go in,\nyou're gonna take a look at this,\n\n114\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.690\nyou're gonna read through it.\n\n115\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.960\nAnd it'll explain all\nthe different options for you.\n\n116\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.720\nNice thing is down at the bottom.\n\n117\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.830\nWe've actually got some examples,\nsome syntax for usage.\n\n118\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.070\nSo I just used this first one right here,\nand what this does\n\n119\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.020\nis scan the index files under whatever\ndirectory we specify for the user.\n\n120\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.490\nAdjust all deletion times for\n\n121\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.680\nlocal timezone, outputs to xml in\nwhatever file we tell it to output to.\n\n122\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.790\nSo, we gonna get the deletion\ntime localised and\n\n123\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.040\nwe're gonna see everything\ninside of an xml file.\n\n124\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.410\nCouldn't be much easier than that if you\nthink about it because xml is gonna be\n\n125\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.780\na human readable format for us.\n\n126\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.306\nWe can just open that up and take a look\nat it so we're gonna minimize this.\n\n127\n00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:38.929\nNow I've already taken the liberty of\nrunning this command just to demonstrate\n\n128\n00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:42.237\nand pull this file together for\nyou already so you can see what's there.\n\n129\n00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:48.170\nSo the executable -x -z -o I gave\nit a file name called result.xml.\n\n130\n00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.120\nSpecified the actual guid, the unique\nidentifier, the security ID for the user,\n\n131\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.890\nwe've done all that.\n\n132\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.030\nSo once we run that,\nI went ahead and I grab that.\n\n133\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.320\nNow that file gets generated\nhere in result.xml.\n\n134\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.430\nRemember we saw that\nsitting in the recycle bin.\n\n135\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.970\nI just generated it locally.\n\n136\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.300\nIf they're gonna do this,\nto actually look at this offline.\n\n137\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.060\nRemember you're doing this on\na forensically sound copy of the drive.\n\n138\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.650\nThis is not dynamic data,\nthis is not volatile.\n\n139\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.340\nThis is data that's in the system\nthat is already there.\n\n140\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.760\nWhen you make a copy, you could do this\noffline on a secondary copy, examine it.\n\n141\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.020\nSo you could put this\nfile anywhere you want.\n\n142\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.170\nIt doesn't have to be written\nto a write block or so\n\n143\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.240\nthere's no write back\ninto the real machine.\n\n144\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.180\nSo I just went ahead and\ndropped it in the root of the recycle bin.\n\n145\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.810\nBut this is something you've got to know.\n\n146\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.140\nIf it's sitting in the root\nof the recycle bin,\n\n147\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.400\nyou don't have rights to be\nable to go in and grab it.\n\n148\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.880\nWhen you try to open it from there,\n\n149\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.720\nwe can't read it because we're\nblocked from seeing it there.\n\n150\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.210\nSo what we have to do is now take that\nfile and we have to put it somewhere else.\n\n151\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.880\nSo I've copied it, I've taken it and\nI've just gone ahead.\n\n152\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.055\nAnd I've dropped it into\nthe root of the c drive.\n\n153\n00:07:54.055 --> 00:07:59.540\nWe can see it just right there sitting\nin c, result.xml down below there.\n\n154\n00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.889\nAnd so from there I can\nopen it up with no trouble.\n\n155\n00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:06.380\nAnd when I do that and I open it up,\nyou're gonna want to word wrap it,\n\n156\n00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.900\nbecause it is a Notepad file.\n\n157\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.260\nIt's gonna come up kind of all crazy.\n\n158\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.920\nSo you're gonna wanna go\nin up to Format there.\n\n159\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.410\nJust turn Word Wrap on,\nbe a little bit easier for you to see.\n\n160\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.110\nAs a matter of fact, let's just go\nin change that font size real quick.\n\n161\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.680\nMake it a little bit bigger for us,\nprobably a little bit easier for\n\n162\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.310\nyou to see that.\n\n163\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:27.720\nAnd so what we get in there as you can\nsee is we have the File name reference.\n\n164\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.250\nSo we have right here the unique\nidentifier for the user.\n\n165\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.970\nThat's going to stamp that file for us,\n\n166\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.390\ntell us okay that's linked\nto that particular user.\n\n167\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.170\nRecord Index.\n\n168\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.270\nIt tells us what index\nfile was actually read.\n\n169\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.300\nThese are the text files,\nthe index files, in the recycle bin.\n\n170\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.380\nI'll show you these when\nyou go back in in a minute.\n\n171\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.600\nThat actually are storing the data\nthat tell us what was deleted.\n\n172\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.740\nWe then have the time stamp\nreferenced against local time.\n\n173\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.650\nRemember, we went ahead and\n\n174\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.610\nwe changed that in the local time on\nthe machine with one of the switches.\n\n175\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:03.510\nThen, we have the actual path that tells\nus what was there and what was deleted.\n\n176\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.090\nI deleted a new text document called\nnewtextdocument.txt off the desktop\n\n177\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.820\nto do the demo.\n\n178\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.164\nSo I went ahead and deleted it.\n\n179\n00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:12.850\nThrew it in the recycle bin, but\nyou saw I emptied the recycle bin,\n\n180\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.020\nits not there any more, right?\n\n181\n00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.940\nIt was gone.\n\n182\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.424\nSo I can get a record of the fact that\nsomebody actually threw something\n\n183\n00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.856\nin the recycle bin and\nwent ahead and deleted it.\n\n184\n00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:24.120\nI can pull that out of the index file,\nsitting in the recycle bin that\n\n185\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.959\nare hidden, that I normally can't see\nusing this tool, if I had multiply files\n\n186\n00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:31.821\nthey'd all be listed here with the\ntimestamp for each deletion, day and time.\n\n187\n00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:36.300\nSo I will be able to track unequivocally\nexactly what the user did.\n\n188\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.074\nNow instead of running, this command,\n\n189\n00:09:40.074 --> 00:09:44.736\nlet's just do the following here,\nlet's go in,\n\n190\n00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:51.186\nlet's do actually one second,\nlet's do this, what I want is that.\n\n191\n00:09:51.186 --> 00:09:55.122\nOkay hold on one second,\nthat okay so, Dir/a,\n\n192\n00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:58.860\nlet's just walk through the logic of this.\n\n193\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.650\nSo we've got this directory right, we need\nto get in there to see this index files,\n\n194\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.915\nthat's what I want to show you, so\nwe have to type string in it, right.\n\n195\n00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:08.798\nSo we're gonna change and this directory,\nnow most people look at that and\n\n196\n00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:10.750\ngo no way I can actually\nsee what's in there.\n\n197\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.980\nIt's a directory,\nI have to just type the path in, right?\n\n198\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.550\nSo we know what it is, right?\n\n199\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.581\nCan you read that to me,\nare you able to see that while I'm typing?\n\n200\n00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:17.399\n&gt;&gt; The?\n\n201\n00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.944\n&gt;&gt; The S1521, whatever,\ncan you read that [CROSSTALK]?\n\n202\n00:10:19.944 --> 00:10:27.776\n&gt;&gt; Sure, s-1-5-21-203323.\n\n203\n00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:37.776\n&gt;&gt; 2093-1225586913-1329617242-1002.\n\n204\n00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:48.257\n&gt;&gt; Now Daniel doesn't know, but\nhis eye doctor called me ahead of time and\n\n205\n00:10:48.257 --> 00:10:50.406\nsaid hey, can you give him an eye\ntest while you're on the screen.\n\n206\n00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:52.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we did that, and\n\n207\n00:10:52.002 --> 00:10:53.054\nset that up for him.\n\n208\n00:10:53.054 --> 00:10:54.098\nSo you passed with flying colors.\n\n209\n00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:54.953\n&gt;&gt; Passed with flying colors,\nlook at that.\n\n210\n00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:55.781\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding.\n\n211\n00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:56.595\n&gt;&gt; I was worried.\n[LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:57.618\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, the real test would\n\n213\n00:10:57.618 --> 00:10:59.637\nhave been you take your glasses off and\nread that, that would have been-\n\n214\n00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:00.145\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n215\n00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:00.651\n&gt;&gt; The real test.\n\n216\n00:11:00.651 --> 00:11:01.458\n&gt;&gt; I was like there's a screen there?\n\n217\n00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:04.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I do a DIR now, you'll notice\n\n218\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.440\nthat I actually get those index files\nthat we were looking at, right.\n\n219\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.579\nAnd you'll see i583,\n2i.txt is the file that we parsed\n\n220\n00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:20.740\nthat actually has some size and\nsubstance associated with it, 116.\n\n221\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.910\nThat was the actual new\ntext document file.\n\n222\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.590\nThe other one that's set to zero was\njust the beginning file that's there.\n\n223\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.566\nThe beginning text file that's there just\nas a reference for when we initialize\n\n224\n00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.712\nthe recycle bin, because I\nactually cleared the recycle bin,\n\n225\n00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:37.999\nshutdown Windows and re-generated\nit to do a clean demo for you.\n\n226\n00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:42.508\nSo I deleted the dollar sign recycle\nbin file, I restarted Windows,\n\n227\n00:11:42.508 --> 00:11:47.499\ncame up clean so we regenerated a brand\nnew instance it had nothing in there.\n\n228\n00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.390\nSo I could just do this and\nshow you one file and do the demo for you,\n\n229\n00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.030\nthat's why we see that\ninitialization file there.\n\n230\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.000\nAnd then the IP file on top is the text\nfile that references what I went ahead and\n\n231\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.260\nI actually deleted.\n\n232\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.680\nAnd so when I do this,\n\n233\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.940\nI'm actually creating a generational file\nthat keeps track of everything I do.\n\n234\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.600\nAnd I can parse that file,\n\n235\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.020\nusing this tool, this is what\nwe call recycle bin forensics.\n\n236\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.630\nWe can go in and\n\n237\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.700\nlook at the information inside\nthe recycle bin using this technique.\n\n238\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.070\nRequires a little bit of work, you gotta\ndrill in, you gotta find the identifiers,\n\n239\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.900\nyou gotta go through,\nparse them out one at a time.\n\n240\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.040\nReference them so\nyou can identify which user is which.\n\n241\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.175\nBut, we've shown you ways in which\nto track back this stuff in other\n\n242\n00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:27.067\ndemonstrations.\n\n243\n00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:31.114\nAnd, as a result, we now have a more\ncomplete picture of what's been going\n\n244\n00:12:31.114 --> 00:12:35.310\non inside of the machine because again,\nremember, things will be deleted.\n\n245\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.590\nWe won't know they're there.\n\n246\n00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.950\nUsing recycle bin forensics,\nwe can actually get a record.\n\n247\n00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.300\nWe can develop a picture of what bad\nactor may have done to remove data from\n\n248\n00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.820\nthe system, at least in theory,\n\n249\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.200\nif they use the recycle bin we\nwould have been able to do that.\n\n250\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.570\nNow, something else interesting just\nbefore we remove ourselves from this\n\n251\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.130\ndemonstration.\n\n252\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:57.050\nLet's minimize this,\nlet's create one more item.\n\n253\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.173\nLet's just call it new folder, just keep\nit real simple right and actually let's\n\n254\n00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:05.013\nmake it even simpler let's just rename\nthat we'll call that Daniel right.\n\n255\n00:13:05.013 --> 00:13:09.738\nSo we know that that's in there and you\nknow how we can normally put something in\n\n256\n00:13:09.738 --> 00:13:13.760\nthe recycle bin and delete it there but\nwhat if we do the following.\n\n257\n00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.570\nWhat if we go ahead and\nwe bypass the recycle bin, right?\n\n258\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.050\nSo if I hit the shift-delete key,\nessentially get rid of it.\n\n259\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.135\nOr function delete in our case cuz,\nthe delete key is working the right way.\n\n260\n00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:27.934\nBut if I do that and we go in and\nwe take a look, right,\n\n261\n00:13:27.934 --> 00:13:32.334\nit's actually in the recycle bin because\nin this machine we're not able to bypass\n\n262\n00:13:32.334 --> 00:13:34.170\nthe recycle bin directly.\n\n263\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.260\nRight, if you remember that,\nbecause of the way this is working.\n\n264\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.780\nSo in our particular environment,\nI can't bypass the recycle bin directly.\n\n265\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.870\nBut what I can do Is the following.\n\n266\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.016\nLet me try one other thing in here.\n\n267\n00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:53.840\nI'm just gonna explain to you\nwhat will happen if I do it.\n\n268\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.800\nBut let me try it here real quick.\n\n269\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.310\nI think that I can,\nit's gonna be the same.\n\n270\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.857\nYeah, I'm moved to the Recycle Bin.\n\n271\n00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:03.639\nThe way our demo is setup,\nthe way our demo environment setup,\n\n272\n00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:06.997\nthe way we're running it, I don't have\nthe ability bypass the Delete Bin or\n\n273\n00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:09.652\nthe Delete function,\ndirectly pass through Recycle Bin.\n\n274\n00:14:09.652 --> 00:14:11.109\nI was gonna show you that when I do that,\n\n275\n00:14:11.109 --> 00:14:13.240\nwe don't have a record of\ngoing through the Recycle Bin.\n\n276\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.820\nIt goes off the system It won't show\nup using this technique but we can\n\n277\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.090\nthen recover it using the information we\nlooked at to see what's on hard drives.\n\n278\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.430\nAnd what's been recovered or rather what's\nbeen deleted and can be recover there.\n\n279\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.600\nWe've done a quick demo that\nin some other episodes.\n\n280\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.989\nWe're gonna drill down a little bit\nmore in the data acquisition and\n\n281\n00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:32.259\nduplication and recovering deleted files.\n\n282\n00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:34.710\nDiscussions that will come\nup post these episodes and\n\n283\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.414\nyou'll be able to see some tools that'll\nactually help us to recover that data,\n\n284\n00:14:38.414 --> 00:14:40.325\nif it's bypassed the recycle bin.\n\n285\n00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:45.180\nSo, this methodology is really gonna\nbe focused more on the recycle bin and\n\n286\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.250\nwhat goes on in the recycle bin.\n\n287\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.560\nBut we are obviously able to then go\nin and see the files that are there.\n\n288\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.870\nSo just wanted to show\nthat to you in Windows 10,\n\n289\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.954\ngive you a kind of a more up to date\nvision of what that may look like.\n\n290\n00:14:55.954 --> 00:14:59.895\nUsing some of the latest Windows\nforensics, tools and techniques and\n\n291\n00:14:59.895 --> 00:15:04.740\nwe can certainly go through and think\nabout the logic of something like that.\n\n292\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.608\nHave you ever used System Restore?\n\n293\n00:15:06.608 --> 00:15:07.782\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of course, everybody has.\n\n294\n00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:08.962\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; In Windows?\n\n295\n00:15:08.962 --> 00:15:11.266\nSo do you know there's a log\nfile associated with that,\n\n296\n00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:13.830\nthat we may be able to look at and\nfind information from?\n\n297\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.246\n&gt;&gt; I did not know but\nthere seems logical [CROSSTALK].\n\n298\n00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:20.497\n&gt;&gt; Most activities in Windows usually\nhave something associated with them there\n\n299\n00:15:20.497 --> 00:15:22.580\nare log files associated\nwith all sorts of stuff.\n\n300\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.152\nThe log files for the restore point\nfunction are called rp.log recovery point\n\n301\n00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:28.627\nor restore point.log.\n\n302\n00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.468\nSo there's value information or\n\n303\n00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:34.551\ninformation that's of value in there\nindicating type of restore point.\n\n304\n00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.020\nThe actual event that occurred,\nthe file name that was used.\n\n305\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.227\nSo there's a lot of information\nthat we may look for\n\n306\n00:15:40.227 --> 00:15:43.630\nRP.log would be the log files\nyou want to search for.\n\n307\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.010\nIn that particular case,\n\n308\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.735\nwe actually can't look at I will talk\nabout a variety of different things.\n\n309\n00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:49.904\nWhat about metadata?\n\n310\n00:15:49.904 --> 00:15:53.160\nWe've talked a bit about metadata and\nwe can go in and\n\n311\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.419\ntake a look for\nall sorts of different kinds of data.\n\n312\n00:15:56.419 --> 00:16:00.209\nWhat I want to do is just quickly go\nover here If we go to our machine,\n\n313\n00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:04.811\nyou'll take a look at our, if you just do\na Google search the way I was about to do,\n\n314\n00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:06.770\nfor PDF metadata extractor.\n\n315\n00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.670\nWhat we can do is we can see that\nthere are tools that will allow us to\n\n316\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.750\npull metadata out of PDFs.\n\n317\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.120\nYou can do the same thing for\nWord documents, by the way.\n\n318\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.340\nAnd notice, there's a version on\nthere that's Cloud based online.\n\n319\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.940\nThere's something in there for Linux,\nfor Java, there's all sorts of stuff.\n\n320\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.245\nAnd we could do this across\na variety of document types.\n\n321\n00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:25.360\nWe could also do this with Perl scripts.\n\n322\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.480\nIt's a little more advanced,\nthere's more and more involved.\n\n323\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.422\nYou have to understand how to write\nthe scripting information out in Perl.\n\n324\n00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:35.436\nBut a lot of the hardcore security and\nforensics tools that run in Windows or\n\n325\n00:16:35.436 --> 00:16:37.720\nLinux are gonna be Perl script based.\n\n326\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.681\nAnd so, if you were to just to do a search\nfor Perl scripts for meta data extraction,\n\n327\n00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:44.960\nyou'd find references to all\nsorts of scripts online as well.\n\n328\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.330\nI gave you some names of some potential\nscripts in the show notes, right?\n\n329\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.738\nRight?\nThings like oledump.perl or\n\n330\n00:16:50.738 --> 00:16:54.840\npdfdump.pl, these are all .perl\nextensions, so .perl scripts.\n\n331\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.180\nSo you may be able to find some of those\nor look at them or build them yourself.\n\n332\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.900\nAgain, a little bit more out beyond\nwhere we are in talking about this at\n\n333\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.630\na high level.\n\n334\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.730\nBut giving you some idea of some of\nthe additional things we may go out and\n\n335\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.720\nlook to do.\n\n336\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.610\nPerl is such an incredibly\npowerful scripting language.\n\n337\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.920\nWe did a demo in one of our prior\nshows with PowerShell, right?\n\n338\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.265\nJust a very quick demo to look at some\nbasic information using WQL as a query\n\n339\n00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:22.235\nlanguage to pull some information out\nabout memory being used for a process.\n\n340\n00:17:22.235 --> 00:17:25.535\nWe could do all that stuff and\nmore using not just PowerShell, but\n\n341\n00:17:25.535 --> 00:17:27.425\nPerl scripting and\na variety of other languages.\n\n342\n00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:31.525\nSo keeping in mind that some of these\nkinds of approaches may also be impactful\n\n343\n00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:34.505\nfor us would be helpful and\nwould be good for you to be aware of.\n\n344\n00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:39.420\nWe've talked about the ability to be\nable to go in and to look at metadata.\n\n345\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.020\nAnd I've actually shown you in\nMicrosoft Word documents and\n\n346\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.450\nsome other stuff where\nyou would find metadata.\n\n347\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.320\nSo keep in mind that metadata\ncan be incredibly powerful for\n\n348\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.720\nus in terms of descriptors,\ninformation about who authored something,\n\n349\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.450\nwhat they did, when they did it.\n\n350\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.840\nTags that are associated with the data's\nkeywords can be searchable and\n\n351\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.020\nlead to other information.\n\n352\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.770\nSo something to be aware of and\nto think about.\n\n353\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.210\nExecutable files can be analyzed as well.\n\n354\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.400\nWe can take at them and\nsee what is going on with them.\n\n355\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.050\nWe have a file tool\ncalled Dependency Walker\n\n356\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.595\nthat is going to be very interesting\ntool for us to take a look at.\n\n357\n00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:17.020\nDepends.exe.\n\n358\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.059\nI think you made the joke about this\nthe last time I did this, right?\n\n359\n00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:23.320\nSo depends.exe in the sys\ninternals toolkit.\n\n360\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.700\nYou can see it up on the screen.\n\n361\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.440\nLet me just zoom in for\nyou before we actually run it just so\n\n362\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.770\nyou can see it right there.\n\n363\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.630\nThat tool is part of the download.\n\n364\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:36.573\nWe can go in and use this tool to\nbe able to, we just execute this.\n\n365\n00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:40.290\nTo be able to go in and\nto look at the dependencies\n\n366\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.050\nassociated with an executable,\nessentially break open the executable and\n\n367\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.470\nlook at the files that are part\nof what's gonna go on with it.\n\n368\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.225\nSo, if we go in and we just grab\nan executable, we open it up, so\n\n369\n00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:52.005\nwe can go in and grab any one of these.\n\n370\n00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:55.875\nI'll use one of the executables\nfrom the SysInternals tools.\n\n371\n00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:56.895\nOr actually, you know what, let's go in.\n\n372\n00:18:56.895 --> 00:18:59.605\nInstead of doing that, let's look at\none of the Microsoft tools, right?\n\n373\n00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:05.555\nSo, let's go in and\nlet's go in here to Windows.\n\n374\n00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:09.120\nAnd let's take an oldie but a goodie.\n\n375\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.324\nAnd lets do Reg edit, right?\n\n376\n00:19:10.324 --> 00:19:12.680\nSo, what is Reg edit actually use?\n\n377\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.037\nWhat DLLs, what systems files?\n\n378\n00:19:14.037 --> 00:19:15.357\nWhat's it gonna work with?\n\n379\n00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:17.280\nWe've been playing with it for a while,\n\n380\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.439\nit's probably a good\nidea to know how works.\n\n381\n00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:20.681\nSo, we'll grab that executable.\n\n382\n00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:21.402\nWe'll open int up.\n\n383\n00:19:21.402 --> 00:19:22.970\nGive it just a second to load up here.\n\n384\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.112\nCuz anybody can use normal tool.\n\n385\n00:19:24.112 --> 00:19:26.340\nWe're gonna use a Microsoft built in tool,\nand\n\n386\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.857\nnot crash the operating system\nin the process [LAUGH].\n\n387\n00:19:28.857 --> 00:19:30.082\nWhich will be interesting.\n\n388\n00:19:30.082 --> 00:19:31.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna wait for it to load.\n\n389\n00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.540\nIt takes a minute normally.\n\n390\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.260\nIt's gotta go out and\nfind all of the tools, the DLL files and\n\n391\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.580\nwhat not that are being used.\n\n392\n00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.010\nI happen to have it open in real time,\nso that's perfectly fine.\n\n393\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.990\nIt's not gonna affect\nthe functioning of the tool.\n\n394\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.270\nBut you can see,\nit breaks down regedit.exe.\n\n395\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:52.455\nAnd what we get is we get a list of all\nthe DLLs that are being used by this tool.\n\n396\n00:19:52.455 --> 00:19:55.810\nNow, we can see the dependencies\nin the system file as we go.\n\n397\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.555\nAnd as a result, when we analyze\nsoftware like this offline,\n\n398\n00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:03.345\nremember, these are gonna be executables\nthat are found in the bit stream copy.\n\n399\n00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:05.035\nWe're analyzing the offline copy.\n\n400\n00:20:05.035 --> 00:20:06.615\nThis is not dynamic or\n\n401\n00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:11.055\nvolatile data, this is data that's in\nthe system that we can analyze offline.\n\n402\n00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:15.085\nSo tools like this are gonna be\nworked against an image copy\n\n403\n00:20:15.085 --> 00:20:16.205\nof the original hard drive.\n\n404\n00:20:16.205 --> 00:20:19.585\nAnd then, we're gonna be drilling down,\nright, looking for information.\n\n405\n00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:23.140\nSo, hey, what's that executable sitting\nin there that we're not familiar with?\n\n406\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.017\nThat thing that says happyunicorn.exe,\nright?\n\n407\n00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:30.570\nOr click on me for\nbad action dot exe or whatever.\n\n408\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.550\nWhen we click there, what we would find\nif we execute this directly in a dynamic\n\n409\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.500\ntest would be that it's gonna infect our\nsystem, who knows what it's gonna do.\n\n410\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.000\nWe're essentially using\na static methodology here.\n\n411\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.870\nSo there's several kinds of\ntesting that can be done.\n\n412\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.790\nStatic testing examines\nthe code by breaking it down\n\n413\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.320\nwithout executing the file.\n\n414\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.699\nWe're not executing regedit.exe using\nthis tool, we're looking at the sub\n\n415\n00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:57.370\ncomponents and the parts that\nmake up reg.exe or regedit.exe.\n\n416\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.730\nWe could dynamically examine\nthis by running the actual code.\n\n417\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.650\nNow, I'm running the registry editor,\nwe've been using it in demos.\n\n418\n00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.020\nYou've seen me using it,\nwe know what it does.\n\n419\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.786\nBut imagine this wasn't regedit.exe.\n\n420\n00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:11.210\nIt was backdoortrojan.exe, right?\n\n421\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.130\nWe wouldn't really know what that does,\nand we wouldn't want to click on it and\n\n422\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.190\nrun this unless we had a better sense.\n\n423\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.830\nNot that breaking it apart\nusing a dependency editor\n\n424\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.670\nis gonna necessarily tell\nyou that it's malware, but\n\n425\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.420\nyou're gonna start seeing file information\nthere that's probably gonna look unusual.\n\n426\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.450\nAnd it's going to forensically help us\nto examine what this executable does and\n\n427\n00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.450\ngive us a better indication of the kind\nof things that we would most likely\n\n428\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.120\nbe wanting to take a look at.\n\n429\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.050\nAnd then,\nwe can document what we find, right?\n\n430\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.130\nAnd so,\nwe can begin to understand more and\n\n431\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.610\nmore about the kind of things\nthat may be happening in here.\n\n432\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.280\nSo, a tool like Depends or Dependency\nWalker is gonna be very helpful for is.\n\n433\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.850\nIt breaks down, as you can see, those\nexecutables into the constituent DLLs.\n\n434\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.700\nIt shows us, and I'll just zoom in so that\nyou could see it, I've highlighted one of\n\n435\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:04.350\nthe sub DLLs, ADVAPI32, a pretty common\nDLL in Windows, up underneath regedit.\n\n436\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:09.060\nI've highlighted that, and\nwe begin to see all of the functions and\n\n437\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.760\nthe entry points in memory\nassociated with that DLL.\n\n438\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.650\nAnd we can see what it does.\n\n439\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.150\nAnd we can see how it works.\n\n440\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.480\nAnd we see all the modules\nassociated with it.\n\n441\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.178\nThis goes a little bit\nbeyond where we are.\n\n442\n00:22:20.178 --> 00:22:23.390\nYou've gotta get more into code analysis\nand actually development to better\n\n443\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.320\nunderstand some of the things\nthat are happening here.\n\n444\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.400\nAlong with system architecture,\nto understand the memory mapping.\n\n445\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.660\nBut people who do forensic analysis for a\nliving are gonna understand how to look at\n\n446\n00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.100\nthis and actually see what's going\non with the code as it executes.\n\n447\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.250\nAnd see where it's\nexecuting in the system.\n\n448\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.540\nAnd we can map that to known behavior, and\n\n449\n00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.730\nwe can understand whether\nthis is acceptable or\n\n450\n00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.955\nthere's a problem and something's\nbeing manipulated in an unusual way.\n\n451\n00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:47.916\nSo, we can drill down, right?\n\n452\n00:22:47.916 --> 00:22:49.490\nAnd we can get very specific here.\n\n453\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.820\nObviously, much, much deeper level of\nknowledge that goes into really being able\n\n454\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.839\nto use some of the information here to\nunderstand what a just token privilege is,\n\n455\n00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.810\nright, at the top may do.\n\n456\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:05.630\nBut we can go in, and we can actually,\nand I'll just zoom in one more time.\n\n457\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.070\nWe can actually go in and\n\n458\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.460\nwe can drill through, we can look up that\nfunction externally to see what it does.\n\n459\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.240\nWe can look at additional C\nfunctions to see how they operate.\n\n460\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.430\nWe can copy that information out.\n\n461\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.020\nWe can highlight that function and\ntrack it through the executable cycle,\n\n462\n00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.930\nseeing where it goes and what it does.\n\n463\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:28.060\nThere's a lot of things in this tool that\nwe can do that are very, very powerful.\n\n464\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.190\nAnd again, this is a free tool.\n\n465\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.170\nThis is part of the sysInternals\ndownload suite.\n\n466\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.650\nI mean, this is a tool that you\ncan get for free from Microsoft.\n\n467\n00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.650\nYou don't even have to go out and\nbuy this tool.\n\n468\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.600\nSo this is something that you\ndefinitely want to think about.\n\n469\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.880\nBut this kind of a tool, this kind of\ninspection is going to require additional\n\n470\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.360\nknowledge and additional training to\nreally understand how to do correctly.\n\n471\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.380\nBut the tool is there,\nas we do with all tools,\n\n472\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.190\nwe encourage you to play with it and\nthink about it.\n\n473\n00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.660\nThere is a help file associated\nwith the tool, just so you can see.\n\n474\n00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.871\nAnd you can see it right there,\nright above the tool depends.chm.\n\n475\n00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:00.026\nYou can read up on the tool a little bit,\n\n476\n00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:01.356\ngives you a basic\nunderstanding of the tool.\n\n477\n00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:03.317\nBut You've got to play with it and\n\n478\n00:24:03.317 --> 00:24:07.041\nreally work with it to get a sense\nof how it's going to operate.\n\n479\n00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.289\nThere are a couple of other odds and\nends that I want to show you and\n\n480\n00:24:10.289 --> 00:24:12.410\nhelp you to understand as we wrap up here.\n\n481\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.770\nWhoops, don't wanna do that,\nthat would be the wrong thing to do.\n\n482\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.310\nLet me move that out of the way so\n\n483\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.760\nwe can actually see what's going on\nthere before I click on the wrong thing.\n\n484\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.462\nSo I get asked a lot, hey,\n\n485\n00:24:21.462 --> 00:24:26.350\nwe're in the event log, in the security\nlog, as we are right now or\n\n486\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:31.320\nabout to be right now, and\nwe're looking at some of this information.\n\n487\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.750\nLet's just go here.\n\n488\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.740\nAnd let's go here real quick,\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n489\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.220\nLet me zoom in here so\nyou can see what I got.\n\n490\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.270\nSo I'm in the Windows Security Log.\n\n491\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.660\nI've gone over,\nI've found a Logon entry, 4624.\n\n492\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.880\nAnd I've gone down, I've just\nlooked at the viewer down here and\n\n493\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.110\nI scroll down just a bit and\nI see Logon Type right there.\n\n494\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.520\nAnd it says Logon Type of 5,\nthe Logon Type ID is 5.\n\n495\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.060\nNow, I can read through\nthe bottom here and\n\n496\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.840\nI can see that this was a success audit\nfor a logon on this computer, and it's\n\n497\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.280\ngonna give me some general information,\nwhen it was logged, that kind of stuff.\n\n498\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.680\nIf I zoom out here, and\nI actually go into the details, and\n\n499\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.730\nI drill down, I can see,\nessentially, the same information.\n\n500\n00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.290\nWhat I can see, if I look,\nis that I can see the user name is system.\n\n501\n00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.440\nThis is an NT Authority system logon.\n\n502\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.080\nMeaning it's a logon for the actual\noperating system for the system account.\n\n503\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.165\nThe S-1-5-8 right atop\nthere TargetUserSid.\n\n504\n00:25:29.165 --> 00:25:31.660\nSo that's gonna the system account for\nthe system.\n\n505\n00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:36.540\nSo it's just a log in probably for\na proxy service request or something.\n\n506\n00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.270\nService account is using its ability\nto go out and find information for us.\n\n507\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.129\nSo I can tell that by looking at the log,\nbut\n\n508\n00:25:43.129 --> 00:25:47.230\nI may not know what Logon Type\nnumber 5 actually equals.\n\n509\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.250\nAnd so a lot of times people have\nquestions about these logon codes.\n\n510\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.290\nWell, you could go out, and\nyou could look them up.\n\n511\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.530\nAnd all I did was go out and\nfind a website for\n\n512\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:55.800\nyou that tells you what they are.\n\n513\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.300\nThere's a lot of different ones out there.\n\n514\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.680\nWe should have this one for\nyou in the show notes.\n\n515\n00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.040\nAnd as you scroll down you'll see logon\ntype two, interactive user logged on,\n\n516\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.110\nlogon type three, network based logon,\nlog on type five,\n\n517\n00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.919\nas I've said, service base logon.\n\n518\n00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:10.566\nAnd that was the service account,\n\n519\n00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:12.700\nservice was started by\nthe service control manager,\n\n520\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.250\nand it gives you little information\nabout what that logo type would be.\n\n521\n00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.442\nSo there is a bunch of\ndifferent logon types.\n\n522\n00:26:18.442 --> 00:26:21.945\nAnd again, from a forensic standpoint,\nit will be a really good idea for\n\n523\n00:26:21.945 --> 00:26:26.105\nyou to be able to go in and take a look\nat these and understand what they are.\n\n524\n00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:28.055\nSo that way when you\nlook at the log files,\n\n525\n00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.665\nyou don't have to drill through like\nI did to look at all the detail.\n\n526\n00:26:30.665 --> 00:26:33.366\nYou just look at the logon code and\ngo, those are the ones I want.\n\n527\n00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:35.820\nAnd search for the service accounts or\nwhatever they may be.\n\n528\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.620\nSo you could do that.\n\n529\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.481\nWe also have another tool,\ncommand line tool,\n\n530\n00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:42.870\nthat may be of interest to\nyou to help you do this.\n\n531\n00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:48.540\nThis tool right here, let me just bring\nthis up and move this over just a wee bit.\n\n532\n00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.450\nThere we go.\n\n533\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.240\nYou can see here, wevtutil,\nWindows Event Utility.\n\n534\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:01.450\nSo let's just clear the screen out here so\nyou can see a little bit better, wevtutil.\n\n535\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.910\nAnd when we do our help file for that,\n\n536\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:09.400\nyou can see that we've got some usage and\nswitches and information here.\n\n537\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.670\nEnables us to retrieve information about\nthe event logs from the command line.\n\n538\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.270\nRemember, everything we do in Windows and\nthe GUI can be done from the command line,\n\n539\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.130\nit's just the matter of knowing where\nto go and how to find that information.\n\n540\n00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.920\nSo, we can go in and\nwe can list the log names.\n\n541\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.910\nSo, if we do EL, it enumerates the logs.\n\n542\n00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.690\nSo, if we do GL, gets the logs,\nSL, sets the logs, etc.\n\n543\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.890\nWe can clear a logs with this tool,\nby the way, as well,\n\n544\n00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.370\nyou may have notice that at the bottom.\n\n545\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.500\nSo, from that hacker perspective.\n\n546\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.270\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n547\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.720\nSo, if we do EL,\nlists all the logs for us.\n\n548\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.060\nDo you have any idea how many\nlogs there are in Windows?\n\n549\n00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.070\nThere are quite a few of them,\nas you can see right there.\n\n550\n00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:50.870\nAnd as we scroll back up, you can see all\nof the different logs that are enumerated.\n\n551\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.410\nAnd there were so\nmany that I actually bypassed the buffer.\n\n552\n00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.120\nBecause I didn't set\nthe buffer big enough,\n\n553\n00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.220\nand I actually ran through the buffer,\nthere were so many.\n\n554\n00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.445\nSo just using this tool,\nI'm gonna get to see all these logs.\n\n555\n00:28:02.445 --> 00:28:06.930\nAnd I can parse and work with, any or all\nof these logs from the tool, if I want to.\n\n556\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.440\nYet another way to go in,\nspecifically, and look for stuff.\n\n557\n00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.475\nAnd, I mean, there's a lot in here.\n\n558\n00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:13.894\nThere are debug logs,\nthere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n559\n00:28:13.894 --> 00:28:17.355\nWhen you go To Event Viewer,\n\n560\n00:28:17.355 --> 00:28:20.355\nyou go in to look at the Windows logs,\nwe have standard logs there.\n\n561\n00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:24.105\nYou go in to look at application and\nservice logs and go up under Microsoft and\n\n562\n00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:25.655\nWindows, there are all.\n\n563\n00:28:25.655 --> 00:28:27.095\nI mean, this is what we're parsing.\n\n564\n00:28:27.095 --> 00:28:28.875\nThere are all these logs here.\n\n565\n00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:32.275\nNot every one of those folders has\na log associated with it all the time,\n\n566\n00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:35.145\nbecause some of those folders are only\npopulated when we do something\n\n567\n00:28:35.145 --> 00:28:36.960\nthat requires a log to be created.\n\n568\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.700\nBut I'm able to see the name\nof every one of those logs and\n\n569\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.660\nwhat they would be by pulling that\ninformation up using the wevt utility, or\n\n570\n00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.200\nthe Windows Event Viewer Utility tool.\n\n571\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.760\nSo we can go in there.\n\n572\n00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.130\nRemember that there are logs that\nmay not be stored in this location.\n\n573\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.380\nLogs are stored in a variety of places.\n\n574\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.245\nSo we can certainly go look here.\n\n575\n00:28:55.245 --> 00:28:57.950\nAnd the nice thing about this is, if you\ndon't know where these logs are stored,\n\n576\n00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.850\nby the way, so a lot of times I get that.\n\n577\n00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.370\nHey, do you know where that log file is?\n\n578\n00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.550\nWell, yeah, I might know where it is,\nbut if you don't, what can you do?\n\n579\n00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:09.090\nFirst, simple to figure out where a log\nis, just right click on it, go in here and\n\n580\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:14.450\nif you want, you can go to properties.\n\n581\n00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.758\nSo let me do this, one second.\n\n582\n00:29:15.758 --> 00:29:17.130\nThere we go.\n\n583\n00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.770\nWe can go in and take a look, and\nwe can either open the save log,\n\n584\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.030\ngo to properties, it's already open,\nwe don't have to do that.\n\n585\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.770\nBut if you go to properties you'll\nsee that we have the path right here.\n\n586\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.091\nJust zoom in so you could see that.\n\n587\n00:29:28.091 --> 00:29:32.781\nSystem root, so whatever it is, see\nWindows, system32, in this case, Winevt,\n\n588\n00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:36.428\nand on the log sub directory,\nall those logs that gonna be listed,\n\n589\n00:29:36.428 --> 00:29:38.469\nthey'll have the .evt extension.\n\n590\n00:29:38.469 --> 00:29:40.410\nBut are we gonna see them all there?\n\n591\n00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.250\nThey're not all gonna be there,\n\n592\n00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.370\nthere's a lot of logs that\ndon't live in this location.\n\n593\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.701\nSo, for instance, what we if we wanted\ngo in and if wanted to see FTP logs, or\n\n594\n00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:51.220\nDHCP logs, or a Windows firewall logs.\n\n595\n00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.330\nThey're not gonna be stored there.\n\n596\n00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.390\nWe're gonna want to know where they are,\nbut they're not gonna be stored there.\n\n597\n00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.270\nSo in that case, this is the directory\nthat we were just looking at.\n\n598\n00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.610\nThey're all gonna be there,\nbut instead, let's go in and\n\n599\n00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.858\nlet's take a look at the folly.\n\n600\n00:30:02.858 --> 00:30:05.760\nLet's go into Windows System 32, and\n\n601\n00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.590\ninstead of winevt,\nuse our delete slash backspace,\n\n602\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.250\nlet's go to Windows System 32 and\nlet's just scroll down.\n\n603\n00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.600\nLet's go to log files, and inside log\nfiles, we'll zoom in so you can see this,\n\n604\n00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.010\nwe've got a bunch of stuff, including\nFirewall, and including other information.\n\n605\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.960\nSo the Windows Firewall\nlogs are stored there.\n\n606\n00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.360\nSo we can go into Firewall,\n\n607\n00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.420\nthere's nothing on this box because we're\nnot running the firewall right now.\n\n608\n00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.270\nBut they would be there,\n\n609\n00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.860\nwe could obviously drill in,\nwe could take a look at those.\n\n610\n00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.355\nIf we have a web server set up, so if\nwe're running IIS, and were running FTP,\n\n611\n00:30:40.355 --> 00:30:44.290\nor anything like that, we'd have the logs\nfor that sitting in there as well,\n\n612\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:50.370\nthey will be up under SMFT PSVC1, and\nthen whatever the logs would be for FTP.\n\n613\n00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.550\nIn IIS we would see\nthe root directory there.\n\n614\n00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:58.710\nWe could go into Windows System32,\ngo look for something like DHCP.\n\n615\n00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.630\nOr if we have it running,\nI don't have it running here, but\n\n616\n00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.380\nif I did I'd see a log file up\nunderneath the service for DHCP.\n\n617\n00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.890\nSame thing for DNS,\nwe have log files for that.\n\n618\n00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.660\nSo we just have to know where to go and\n\n619\n00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.250\nwhat to look for\nin order to find all that stuff.\n\n620\n00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.490\nBut all of that's gonna be\nsitting in here as well.\n\n621\n00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.860\nAnd remember, our forensics tools\nwill typically be able to capture all\n\n622\n00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.610\nthat for us.\n\n623\n00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.750\nThat data is not volatile,\nthose log files will sit there,\n\n624\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.620\nunless somebody goes in and manipulates\nthem, obviously, and pulls them out.\n\n625\n00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.720\nIn which case then, we obviously\nhave to worry about finding them and\n\n626\n00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.410\nthen recovering them.\n\n627\n00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.870\nBut if they don't,\nwe make a bitstream copy,\n\n628\n00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.100\nforensically sound copy of that drive,\nwe're gonna have all that data.\n\n629\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.510\nWe can access it offline and just look for\nit and kind of leisurely walk through,\n\n630\n00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.070\nexamining and understanding what's\ngoing on with our log files as we go.\n\n631\n00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.840\nSo we can find all that data in there.\n\n632\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.740\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of funny.\n\n633\n00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:47.258\nWindows is almost acting forensically\nin our favor in a lot of ways, keeping,\n\n634\n00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:49.386\nas we saw, tons of log files in here.\n\n635\n00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:53.109\nAnd as any IT worker, or\neven manager or whatever the case is,\n\n636\n00:31:53.109 --> 00:31:56.701\nis you're probably gonna work\nwith logs from time to time.\n\n637\n00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:58.424\nYou need to know a little bit about logs.\n\n638\n00:31:58.424 --> 00:31:59.896\nAnd then to think, yeah,\n\n639\n00:31:59.896 --> 00:32:03.138\nnow all I have to is to shift gears\ninto thinking Im an investigator.\n\n640\n00:32:03.138 --> 00:32:04.450\nI'm trying to investigate of something.\n\n641\n00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.115\nI can use those logs to my advantage.\n\n642\n00:32:07.115 --> 00:32:08.709\nDefinitely puruse throught those things.\n\n643\n00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:11.380\nA lot of great activities out there\nto help you do that very thing.\n\n644\n00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.612\nAdam showed us one of them.\n\n645\n00:32:12.612 --> 00:32:13.209\nVery, very helpful.\n\n646\n00:32:13.209 --> 00:32:15.657\nFind one that you like that works for\nyou and\n\n647\n00:32:15.657 --> 00:32:18.717\nreally learn how to use it\nlike a surgeon's scalpel.\n\n648\n00:32:18.717 --> 00:32:22.789\nAnd you will find a lot of information\nrunning around the log files inside\n\n649\n00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:24.300\nthe Windows system.\n\n650\n00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.845\nAdam, you have anything else we need\nto talk about before we close the show?\n\n651\n00:32:28.845 --> 00:32:31.730\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I think that what\nwe've done five episodes,\n\n652\n00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:36.025\n[CROSSTALK] probably several hours of\nWindows forensics behind us at this point.\n\n653\n00:32:36.025 --> 00:32:39.030\nThere's certainly, there's so\nmuch other stuff we could drill into.\n\n654\n00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:43.210\nBut at some point, we have to say okay,\nhey, you got a good starting point, right?\n\n655\n00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.100\nLet's go on and talk about another topic.\n\n656\n00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.900\nI think we're tried to give you a really\ngood overview of the various places,\n\n657\n00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.000\ntools, techniques.\n\n658\n00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.790\nAnd thought processes an investigator\nwould use in Windows.\n\n659\n00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.240\nBut to be clear, we've really only\nscratched the proverbial surface.\n\n660\n00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.630\nAnd you've got to go deeper and wider\nas you develop your skills in reality.\n\n661\n00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.460\nAs you practice these\nskills in the real world.\n\n662\n00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.110\nBut certainly done a very large memory\ndump, so to speak, of data for you.\n\n663\n00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.340\nGiven you a lot to think about.\n\n664\n00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.860\nA lot of information will be valuable for\nyou as you prepare for the CHFI exam.\n\n665\n00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.780\nA lot of the tools we talked about.\n\n666\n00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.580\nI would not spend too much\ntime on an individual tool.\n\n667\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.800\nAnd say hey, this SI tool, if I go in and\nlook at Dependency Walker,\n\n668\n00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.310\nshould I know everything about the tool?\n\n669\n00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.460\nYou may see the tool as an example\nof a tool that does something.\n\n670\n00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.560\nBut we're not going to drill in and\nask you, on those kinds of exams,\n\n671\n00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.970\ntypically, about vendor specific tools.\n\n672\n00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.590\nBecause it's not a Microsoft exam,\nright, it's a vendor neutral exam.\n\n673\n00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.050\nBut are there going to be\nmethodology questions?\n\n674\n00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.530\nAre there going to be technique questions?\n\n675\n00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.650\nAre there going to be ideas that\nare tested on to understand that you\n\n676\n00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.800\nhave actually gathered the knowledge and\nunderstand how to apply it\n\n677\n00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.770\nfrom a forensically sound standpoint\nwith regards to methodology?\n\n678\n00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.440\nAbsolutely and we've tried to examine\nthose methodology standards and\n\n679\n00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.400\npoints with you.\n\n680\n00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.210\nBy demonstrating them through certain\ntools, but I keep reminding you and so\n\n681\n00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.020\ndoes Daniel.\n\n682\n00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.540\nThat the use of these tools forensically\nin a sound manner, making sure we use and\n\n683\n00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.690\nunderstand how to use them.\n\n684\n00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:07.420\nTo either gather volatile data or volatile\ndata is going to be gathered then.\n\n685\n00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.690\nWe shut the system down.\n\n686\n00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.490\nLook at the non volatile data offline\nthrough a separate forensic copy,\n\n687\n00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:14.670\nis really what we want to think about or\nwant to be aware of.\n\n688\n00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.880\nIf you're comfortable with that thought\nprocesses we demonstrated it time\n\n689\n00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.840\nand again.\n\n690\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.200\nThen it's definitely time to drop,\ndo we have a microphone?\n\n691\n00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n692\n00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Drop the microphone proverbially\n&gt;&gt; We'll drop the mouse instead and\n\n693\n00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:26.310\nwe'll move on to some other topics.\n\n694\n00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.810\nBut keep in mind, this is really just the\nbeginning of your journey and there's so\n\n695\n00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.240\nmuch more for you to examine here.\n\n696\n00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.380\nAnd there's so many other tools for\nyou to play with.\n\n697\n00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.520\nYou'll build on the knowledge,\nfind other tools.\n\n698\n00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.200\nGo out and challenge the assumptions\nyou have about how forensics work and\n\n699\n00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.500\nthen, figure out how to make\nit work on your machine.\n\n700\n00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.070\nAnd that's the victory\nthat you wanna claim and\n\n701\n00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.190\nultimately, that's how you become\nbetter at doing this stuff.\n\n702\n00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.300\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam, last words\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n703\n00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.315\nthat is Windows forensics in a nutshell,\nI guess we could say.\n\n704\n00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:53.520\nYeah, big nutshell, [LAUGH].\n\n705\n00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.740\nThere's plenty more to it, so definitely\nget out there, get your hands dirty.\n\n706\n00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.940\nPlay around with this stuff so that you\nhave that practical working knowledge.\n\n707\n00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.470\nHelps you understand the concepts and\n\n708\n00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.860\nthe theories that we're trying to convey\nto you when you see it in action.\n\n709\n00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.720\nSo that being said,\nit looks like it's time for us to\n\n710\n00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.470\nbid a fond farewell to our good friends\nthere out there watching us in TV land.\n\n711\n00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:12.120\nBut guess what?\n\n712\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.700\nThere's more episodes to come, this is not\nthe end of CHFI, just Windows Forensics.\n\n713\n00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.520\nThanks for watching.\n\n714\n00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.760\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n715\n00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n716\n00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.726\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n717\n00:35:22.726 --> 00:35:28.696\n[MUSIC]\n\n718\n00:35:28.696 --> 00:35:32.007\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.382\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:12.280\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.252\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:17.018\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:20.282\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well,\n\n8\n00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.746\nit's none other than\nmore on our CHFI series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:26.421\nAnd of course joining us back yet\nagain for a little more of that action,\n\n10\n00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:28.209\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:29.255\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.233\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hopefully better.\n\n13\n00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully better.\n\n14\n00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:34.830\nIt is going well, it is going well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.020\nSo looking forward to spending\nsome more time talking with you.\n\n16\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.990\nWe're gonna talk a bit about data\nacquisition, duplication and recovery,\n\n17\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.540\nkinda what we do, how we do it.\n\n18\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.050\nWe've spoken in prior episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.830\nspent a lot of time, as a matter of fact,\ntalking in prior episodes about\n\n20\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.780\nthe need to be forensically sound in our\napproach when we are dealing with data.\n\n21\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500\nWe're gonna actually take\nthat a level deeper now,\n\n22\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.990\nshow you how to make\nan image of a hard drive.\n\n23\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.030\nWe've actually shown you the material\nthat potentially you could buy from\n\n24\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.890\na third-party vendor, machines, hardware\nthat could be used, in prior episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.270\nWe've talked about the technique and\n\n26\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.630\nthe thought process of doing\na bit stream disk to image copy,\n\n27\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.610\nor a bit stream to disk copy,\ndisk to disk using a third-party utility.\n\n28\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.160\nWe're gonna take a look in just\na minute at one that we can use.\n\n29\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.810\nGonna do a quick kinda throw away image\njust to show you the process using\n\n30\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.570\nthe tool called R Disk Image, there's\nlots of software you can use to do this.\n\n31\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.890\nWe'll take an image like the one we're\ngonna create, we'll mount it and\n\n32\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.210\ndo some exploration of it,\nsee what kind of data may be in there,\n\n33\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.110\nare there deleted files, things like that,\nthat we maybe able to recover.\n\n34\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.480\nYou'd be surprised at what we can find,\nwe'll take a look at some of that.\n\n35\n00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.130\nBut let's start by talking\nabout what data acquisition is.\n\n36\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.500\nIt's easy to say in theory well\nit's the acquisition of data.\n\n37\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.110\nRight, Daniel our wordsmith here was\nplaying with words trying to figure out\n\n38\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660\nwhat could we use as pseudonyms for\n\n39\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.610\ndata acquisition before we got\nstarted data recovery, duplication.\n\n40\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.670\nBut generically to understand and\ndefine the idea, the process of imaging or\n\n41\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.260\notherwise obtaining information from\na digital device in any peripheral\n\n42\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.890\nequipment or media is what\ndata acquisition is all about.\n\n43\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.720\nThis is how we define data\nacquisition in the CHFI world,\n\n44\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.960\nin the investigative world\nof digital forensics.\n\n45\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.855\nWe define that acquisition as the ability\nto understand how to ultimately\n\n46\n00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:17.350\ncapture data in a forensically sound way\nand then analyze it, interact with it.\n\n47\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.280\nSo we're gonna spend some time\ntalking about how to do that and\n\n48\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.460\ninstead of just talking about it,\nwe do a lot of talking here at ITProTV,\n\n49\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.410\nand we do a lot of showing\nas well as a lot of telling.\n\n50\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.500\nBut I thought it would be good to talk\na little bit but show a lot more.\n\n51\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.190\nWe just did a five part series\non Windows forensics where I\n\n52\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.710\nthink we talked a fair amount, but\n\n53\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.280\nwe really tried to show a great deal as\nwell and tried to do a little bit of both.\n\n54\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.580\nI know it's always fun and exciting for\nus here, we joke around a lot about it but\n\n55\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.530\nit's fun and exciting for\nus to demo stuff for you.\n\n56\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.770\nBut I know it's also exciting for\n\n57\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.370\nyou to see it to be able to figure\nout how to interact with it.\n\n58\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.880\nSo I want to actually do some of that for\n\n59\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.980\nyou and show you what's going on\ninstead of just talking about it.\n\n60\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.040\nSo we're gonna jump into our\nmachine here if you will.\n\n61\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.840\nAnd instead of doing that I\nactually you should do that.\n\n62\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.340\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n63\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.020\n&gt;&gt; And then it would be- not like that.\n\n64\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.770\nThat right there.\n\n65\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.560\nAnd then it would show up and\nthen I could do that and point to it.\n\n66\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.710\nAnd if you'd take that off the screen\nagain I'm gonna really be upset with you\n\n67\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.590\nso don't do that.\n\n68\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.910\nSo when we take a look and you could see\nhere we have our R Drive Image software,\n\n69\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.510\nlet me just scroll in, scroll in, let\nme zoom in and scroll at the same time.\n\n70\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.680\nYou could see the software here.\n\n71\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.890\nI just have it loaded up so\nwe can already see where it is,\n\n72\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.160\nkind of positioned on the screen.\n\n73\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.900\nSo when we do the box in box\nyou guys can actually see it.\n\n74\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.275\nBut you can see we create an image.\n\n75\n00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:28.695\nWe can restore an image, copy a disk\nto a disk, so make a disk-to-disk copy.\n\n76\n00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:31.235\nOne of the things we're gonna take a look\nat or at least talk about how to do.\n\n77\n00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:32.855\nBut let's start by creating an image.\n\n78\n00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:36.185\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll create an image\nhere, we'll just go ahead and click Next.\n\n79\n00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:37.764\nA nice thing about a lot of these tools,\n\n80\n00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:39.730\nthey'll give you step\nby step instructions.\n\n81\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520\nAnd what I mean by that\nis if we go back for\n\n82\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.029\njust one second,\nwhat am I doing down here?\n\n83\n00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.780\nIt says hey, create an image of the\nselected hard drive, one or more several\n\n84\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.670\npartitions, logical disks, save that\noff and do various things with it.\n\n85\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.690\nSo we're not sure what we're doing,\ntells us exactly, which is nice.\n\n86\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.120\nSo gonna click Next.\n\n87\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.466\nWe've got two partitions there.\n\n88\n00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:58.490\nWe've got C Drive,\n\n89\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.260\nwe've got the E Drive, we created a small,\nfat partition that'll be quick for\n\n90\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.750\nus to work with, copying the C Drive at\n130 gigs and having a place to store that.\n\n91\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.800\nIt's gonna take a while and it's gonna\ntake a little longer than we want to spend\n\n92\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.880\ndoing the demo so we're gonna just use\nthis quick little four gig partition here.\n\n93\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.930\nSo we gotta highlight that.\n\n94\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.260\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nwe are gonna click next.\n\n95\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.430\nWe're gonna give it a name, tell it where\nwe want to save it or what we want to do.\n\n96\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.990\nSo we'll call this Scratch,\noops hold on one second.\n\n97\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.780\nLet's call this ITProTV Scratch so\n\n98\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.440\nthat we know,\nexcept I didn't spell scratch correctly.\n\n99\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.710\nThat's what you get for\ntrying to do this live.\n\n100\n00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.730\nWe'll do that ITProTV Scratch.\n\n101\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.200\nIt's gonna have a .arc extension,\nwhich is the image file extension.\n\n102\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.160\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do that,\nlet me give it a path there.\n\n103\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.150\nSo we give it one second.\n\n104\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.630\nWe'll just throw it up on the desktop and\nspecify that.\n\n105\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.390\nLet me put that into the, or\nnot in the desktop rather, but\n\n106\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.730\nlet me put it in the root of the C drive.\n\n107\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.350\nWe'll just throw it there, it's easy\nenough to find it when we do that.\n\n108\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.410\nSo I'll throw it into the C drive there.\n\n109\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.070\nClick Next.\n\n110\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.407\nSearching for any connected CDs, got to\ngive it a second, it's gonna come up and\n\n111\n00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:12.279\nsay hey you don't have a CD-ROM\nthat you can write to but\n\n112\n00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.342\nwe'll let you go ahead and write it to\nthe desktop or the local drive whatever.\n\n113\n00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:19.926\nSo we'll give it a second, it's gonna\ngo ahead and search, it usually takes\n\n114\n00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:23.290\nabout a minute, minute and a half\nthe first time you do it with this tool to\n\n115\n00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.820\nfind all the media so don't be surprised\nif you actually do this yourself and\n\n116\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.940\nit takes a moment or so to run through.\n\n117\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.420\nI didn't preload this particular tool and\nrun it through ahead of time so\n\n118\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.400\nwe have to just wait for it to discover.\n\n119\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.830\nBut it's looking to see if there's any\nwritable media sources that we can use,\n\n120\n00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.900\nlike a DVD-ROM.\n\n121\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.110\nSo remember typically you create\nthis image off the machine.\n\n122\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.680\nYou don't normally do it locally.\n\n123\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.471\nWe're just doing it locally as a demo for\n\n124\n00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.860\nyou just to give you a sense\nof how the tool works.\n\n125\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.712\nBut we're not actually\nset up with this with a,\n\n126\n00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:51.610\nlike a DVD burner on the machine\nwhere we can write it directly.\n\n127\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.570\nSo we're just gonna wait for\nthat to happen.\n\n128\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.360\nWhile that's going and\ndoing its thing, by the way,\n\n129\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.050\nwhat we can do is we'll go in here to,\njust let that finish up.\n\n130\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.592\nWe'll just go over here to the C drive.\n\n131\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.630\nAnd we'll take a look,\nyou'll see there's no image there yet but\n\n132\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.800\nif we go in here what we\ncan see is the following.\n\n133\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.570\nGot an image test directory,\n\n134\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.660\nwait let's do that one there,\ngot an image test directory.\n\n135\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.990\nI created a test image already,\njust did one in advance just to show you.\n\n136\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.120\nI just forgot where I put it.\n\n137\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n138\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.594\ncan see right there ITProTVimage1.arc.\n\n139\n00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.230\nYou can see I did that and\nI have that set up.\n\n140\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.180\nSo we're gonna just mount\nessentially either that image or\n\n141\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.460\nan other one once we complete\nour little demo here.\n\n142\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.480\nBut you can see what\nthe image file looks like.\n\n143\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.500\nIt's not very big.\n\n144\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.880\nYou can see it's only 20 kilobytes\nin size, not very big at all.\n\n145\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.620\nAll right so that came through,\nit's kind of done searching.\n\n146\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.370\nWhat it then gives us the ability to do\nis just zoom in so you can see there.\n\n147\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.660\nGot our little image name there.\n\n148\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.260\nCheck the image file\nimmediately upon its creation.\n\n149\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.120\nI can specify compression ratio,\nhow I wanna back up the data.\n\n150\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.900\nDo I wanna do sector-by-sector backup or\nback up actual data only.\n\n151\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.657\nRemember we've talked about hard drive\ngeometry, we've talked about sectors,\n\n152\n00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.116\nclusters, allocation, etc.\n\n153\n00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:08.190\nYou should have a since by now of what\nthat is, if you don't go back and\n\n154\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.650\nwatch those episodes,\nwould be helpful for you.\n\n155\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.619\nWe spent a lot of time talking about\nhow hard drives are set up and\n\n156\n00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:16.982\nthe structure and you can see now that\nthat knowledge is now valuable for\n\n157\n00:07:16.982 --> 00:07:18.735\nusing a tool like this to do imaging.\n\n158\n00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:22.245\nCuz now you understand what a sector is\nand you can understand why we may need to\n\n159\n00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:24.680\nspecify how we want to\nback our data up that way.\n\n160\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.355\nDo I wanna actually do the image size and\nsplit it,\n\n161\n00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:30.810\nhave the system automatically split it,\nset up a certain size?\n\n162\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.644\nA lot of times when\nwe're doing a big drive,\n\n163\n00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:35.670\nwe're gonna have to parse this\ninto separate image files, right?\n\n164\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.270\nBecause you may wanna fit them on CD's so\nroughly about 700 MB.\n\n165\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.060\nYou may fit them on DVD's these days,\nprobably not CD's.\n\n166\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.170\nBut DVD's, right, so maybe four gigabytes\nin size or whatever the case may be.\n\n167\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.818\nSo we may have to break it up and we may\nhave to either let the system decide that\n\n168\n00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:53.025\nbased on the media we choose and\nthe mechanism or the device we use.\n\n169\n00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:56.025\nOr we may hard coat that and\nsay no I want 50 meg image files and\n\n170\n00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:59.084\nI want 100 of them and\nit's gonna be 5 gigs or whatever, and\n\n171\n00:07:59.084 --> 00:08:02.288\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna specify that and break that up.\n\n172\n00:08:02.288 --> 00:08:03.339\nSo I can do that.\n\n173\n00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.201\nI can put a password in here as well.\n\n174\n00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:07.580\nAnd you'll notice I can\nsecure my image files.\n\n175\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.621\nNow it may not be something we think\nabout off the top of our heads as\n\n176\n00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:14.052\na forensic investigator, but\nas a security professional generically,\n\n177\n00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:17.250\nthink about the value of putting\na password on an image file.\n\n178\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.190\nSomebody can't just take the image,\nmount it and\n\n179\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.380\nlook at the data without\nknowing what the password is.\n\n180\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.780\nForensically sound process also\ninvolves image security or\n\n181\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.360\nawareness of security with\nregards to handling of data.\n\n182\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.750\nAnd passwords are a pretty standard\nthought process, with regard to that.\n\n183\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.210\nSo, just something to think\nabout as we go through here.\n\n184\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.309\nSo we'll go ahead,\nwe'll let the system kinda do that.\n\n185\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.074\nIf we backup actual data only,\nversus a sector by sector backup,\n\n186\n00:08:42.074 --> 00:08:44.200\nnotice it changes the size.\n\n187\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.060\nRight, it says, you'll estimated\nthis size 2.66 Gigs, versus 8 Megs.\n\n188\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.500\nFor just the data itself.\n\n189\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.140\nSo we'll do that,\n\n190\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.750\nit's not really gonna be 2.6,\nit's gonna be a lot smaller than that.\n\n191\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.790\nBut we'll do a sector by sector backup,\nlet's hit next.\n\n192\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.303\nAre we gonna use the Windows\nvolume snapshot service, if so\n\n193\n00:09:00.303 --> 00:09:05.517\nthat's one of our providers, we can ignore\nthe disk errors, if there are bad sectors.\n\n194\n00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:09.069\nA lot of times you'll have bad sectors\non a hard drive that have been mapped or\n\n195\n00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:13.220\nmarked as being bad that don't store data,\nwe can ignore those, skip over them.\n\n196\n00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.838\nA forensic trick, we may actually want to\ngather those, and we do with some tools,\n\n197\n00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:18.711\nnot with this one, but\nwe can if we want to.\n\n198\n00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:22.570\nAnd we can actually see because there's\noften times a way, and there are ways for\n\n199\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.390\nus to use those bad sectors to hide data,\nnot because they're bad originally.\n\n200\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.420\nIf they're really truly bad,\nwe probably don't.\n\n201\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.800\nBut we can actually mark sectors of a hard\ndrive as bad even though they're not.\n\n202\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.519\nAnd we can hide data inside of them.\n\n203\n00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.315\nA little forensics trick\nthat we learn how to do.\n\n204\n00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:40.032\nAnd as a result of that, we actually\nwanna capture those bad sectors because,\n\n205\n00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:43.210\njust because it says it's bad,\ndoesn't mean it really is.\n\n206\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.340\nA bad actor may have marked a good sector,\nor good sectors, of the hard drive bad,\n\n207\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.680\npreventing the system from writing data\nto them again, and looking at them, and\n\n208\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.380\nessentially blinding us to them normally,\nwhen in fact they're perfectly fine.\n\n209\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.810\nAnd they're just hiding data there.\n\n210\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.102\nSo, pretty devious, sneaky little\nbastards those [CROSSTALK] can be.\n\n211\n00:10:00.102 --> 00:10:00.948\nThey are, right?\n\n212\n00:10:00.948 --> 00:10:02.168\nSo, we could do all this.\n\n213\n00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.531\nAnd obviously, we'll figure that out.\n\n214\n00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:05.180\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n215\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to start that.\n\n216\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.230\nWe're gonna run that.\n\n217\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.454\nYou'll see it's not gonna\ntake very long at all.\n\n218\n00:10:12.454 --> 00:10:14.670\nWe'll just let that run,\nless than a minute.\n\n219\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.330\nVery, very quick.\n\n220\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.480\nAnd Image completed, that did not\ntake very long at all, all right?\n\n221\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.466\nSo we're done there.\n\n222\n00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:23.003\nLet's just go ahead and hit Continue.\n\n223\n00:10:23.003 --> 00:10:23.700\nWe go back there.\n\n224\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:30.180\nNow let's go in and let's just take\na look at the root of the C drive.\n\n225\n00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.794\nWe will find our image sitting,\nright there, there it is,\n\n226\n00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:40.189\nand you can see it did not\ntake very long at all.\n\n227\n00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:44.575\nAnd it is not very big,\nit's 38 kilobytes approximately.\n\n228\n00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:47.915\nNone of that 2.66 garbage [CROSSTALK]\nstuff that it said, right, for gigabytes.\n\n229\n00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.171\nRight, so\nyou can see it's not very big at all,\n\n230\n00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:53.290\nand we now have that image and\nwe actually are able to work with it.\n\n231\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.490\nNow in theory what that is is an image of\nthe E drive and so In the system here.\n\n232\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.850\nWe see that it's an image of the E drive\nand in the E drive we have Recycle Bin.\n\n233\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.950\nWe have secret data.\n\n234\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.444\nBut notice there is nothing\nin the secret data folder.\n\n235\n00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:08.204\nOr is there?\n\n236\n00:11:08.204 --> 00:11:08.941\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n237\n00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.479\nWe've already learned a few ways\nin which you could hide data and\n\n238\n00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:14.970\nmake it look like there's nothing\nthere but actually there is.\n\n239\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.611\n&gt;&gt; It's there it's just that we\npainted it white on white so\n\n240\n00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.997\nyou can't see it [CROSSTALK].\n\n241\n00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:20.226\n&gt;&gt; White text on white background.\n\n242\n00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.679\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, no there really is,\npotentially there really is data there,\n\n243\n00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:24.200\nlets take a look at what may be there.\n\n244\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.330\nSo we agree right, on the surface\nanyway that there's nothing there.\n\n245\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.960\nNo tricks, we didn't paint the data\nwhite on white, nothing like that.\n\n246\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.130\nThere appears to be a folder\ncalled secret data, but\n\n247\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.590\nclearly there does not\nappear to be anything in it.\n\n248\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.510\nSo let's take a look at potentially\nwhat may be there, right.\n\n249\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.080\nSo if we go in and we take a look,\n\n250\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.570\nlet's put this tool off to the side for\na minute.\n\n251\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.150\nSo let's just do the following.\n\n252\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.920\nLet's just hit exit here.\n\n253\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.620\nWe'll come back to that tool in a minute.\n\n254\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.120\nBut let's go in here, and\n\n255\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.010\nlet's actually use another tool to\npotentially examine what may be there.\n\n256\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.515\nSo let's take a look and see.\n\n257\n00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:59.240\nSo let's go in and\nlet's use a tool called DDR Professional.\n\n258\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.690\nWe'll load this up,\nthis is another tool we can use.\n\n259\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.951\nJust trying to play around a little\nbit a few different tools,\n\n260\n00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:07.300\nshow you some of the things\nthat are available here.\n\n261\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.790\nSo this tool, zoom in here, let's us\nlook at the partitions on a machine.\n\n262\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.710\nNow we're gonna be able to\nwork right off the E drive.\n\n263\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.460\nWe don't even have to worry\nabout using the image.\n\n264\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.610\nIn this tool because of the way it's set\nup I'm just gonna use the fixed hard drive\n\n265\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.320\nthat's mounted instead\nof mounting the image.\n\n266\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.230\nI could mount the image.\n\n267\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.564\nIt's essentially the same thing.\n\n268\n00:12:23.564 --> 00:12:27.326\nIn the real world, clearly,\nwe would work with an image file offline,\n\n269\n00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:30.100\nwe would not work to be clear\non the local hard drive.\n\n270\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.950\nBut I'm just showing you that\nI could do this either way.\n\n271\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.190\nSo I can go in and\n\n272\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.010\nyou'll see here that I can grab this\ndisk one is going to be the eDrive, so\n\n273\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.870\nwe can go and we could see that in\na way we can tell by the way right?\n\n274\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.740\nIs you could see their capacity size,\nyou know four gigabytes and\n\n275\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.740\nit's going to be a FAT partition.\n\n276\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.190\nSo we know that it's sitting\non the system there and\n\n277\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.030\nit tells us all the information\nwe need to know about it.\n\n278\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.170\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna go do a deep search on that.\n\n279\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.030\nSo we'll highlight that.\n\n280\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.420\nWe'll do a deep search.\n\n281\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.330\nWe'll click next.\n\n282\n00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.844\nWe'll specify the partition, it's FAT32.\n\n283\n00:13:05.844 --> 00:13:10.300\nSo we know that is the drive and\nthe image that we're looking at.\n\n284\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.673\nAnd then go ahead, we'll hit Next,\nlet it do its search there.\n\n285\n00:13:14.984 --> 00:13:17.105\nIt's gonna run through look at everything.\n\n286\n00:13:19.422 --> 00:13:22.386\nSpecify that and then what do we find?\n\n287\n00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:24.180\nWe get a listing, right?\n\n288\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.250\nOf all of the information\nthat is on the drive.\n\n289\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.930\nWe did see the recycle bin directory,\n\n290\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.070\nwell we saw recycle bin but\nthat's recycle bin directory.\n\n291\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.346\nWe can see that there is a temp file,\nsome miscellaneous information, but\n\n292\n00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:38.939\nthere's that folder called secret data\nthat we were looking at just a moment ago.\n\n293\n00:13:38.939 --> 00:13:41.566\nNow we said there was\nnothing in there in theory.\n\n294\n00:13:41.566 --> 00:13:42.740\nBut let's actually take a look.\n\n295\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.400\nTurns out, that there happen to be\ntwo documents sitting in this file.\n\n296\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.368\n&gt;&gt; You sneaky snake you.\n\n297\n00:13:51.368 --> 00:13:54.342\n&gt;&gt; I am, I am, and I actually called\nthem Document of DOOM just so\n\n298\n00:13:54.342 --> 00:13:55.930\nit would be cool to look at.\n\n299\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.860\nYou can see it right there,\nDocument of DOOM.\n\n300\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.220\nSo you can see that there\nactually are two Word documents,\n\n301\n00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.510\nI'm just gonna extend this out so\nyou can see this a little bit.\n\n302\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.060\nTwo Word documents sitting here,\nthere is my personal favorite,\n\n303\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.700\nDocument of DOOM, and a new Word document.\n\n304\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.124\nI created a couple of documents,\nput them in there, deleted them, and\n\n305\n00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:16.620\nthen you could see that we actually\nare able to see them and recover them.\n\n306\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.680\nAnd we can see the date that the documents\nwere created up in the corner there,\n\n307\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.480\nall right, we can see them.\n\n308\n00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.220\nAnd we can see that there actually is\ndata sitting in that directory and\n\n309\n00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.890\nagain if we did the soft image or\nthe actual physical drive,\n\n310\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.140\neither one, it would be the same, right?\n\n311\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.708\nAnd so we could actually can go in and\nyou'll see that in the eval edition,\n\n312\n00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:41.078\nwhich is what I'm using\njust to show you this tool.\n\n313\n00:14:41.078 --> 00:14:44.422\nWe don't have the ability to actually\nrecover the data, we simply can see it,\n\n314\n00:14:44.422 --> 00:14:47.323\nbut in the full version of this tool\nif you were to spend money for it.\n\n315\n00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:50.219\nYou would be able to right click,\nopen and actually recover, and\n\n316\n00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:53.433\nopen that document and see the cool\nstuff I put into the document of doom,\n\n317\n00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:55.030\nwhich was really cool, by the way.\n\n318\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.747\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sure.\n\n319\n00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:57.067\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou're not gonna know what it is now,\n\n320\n00:14:57.067 --> 00:14:58.481\nbecause I'm too cheap to buy the software.\n\n321\n00:14:58.481 --> 00:14:59.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there you go.\n\n322\n00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:03.406\nBut you can see that if we do actually\nhave a fully licensed copy of this or\n\n323\n00:15:03.406 --> 00:15:04.900\nother software, right?\n\n324\n00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.530\nThis is not the only one, this is just\none that I'm playing with to show you.\n\n325\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.500\nBut if we did this, we would actually\nbe able to recover the documents.\n\n326\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.870\nCouple of clicks and boom,\nit's actually there, right?\n\n327\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.270\nSo we actually can see that\nthere is information there.\n\n328\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.070\nWe can go into the recycle bin.\n\n329\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.750\nNotice that there's nothing in the recycle\nbin but the data is sitting there,\n\n330\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.210\neven though it was deleted\nwe can just find it.\n\n331\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.230\nWe have to go in and\nof course know what directory to look at.\n\n332\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.990\nSo even a tool that we just demoed,\n\n333\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.960\na tool like this that just lets us see\nwhat's there without fully recovering it.\n\n334\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.620\nStill has the capabilities\nof finding the data, right?\n\n335\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.330\nSo, again, this is kinda interesting.\n\n336\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.573\nSo we could use a tool like this, right?\n\n337\n00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:41.120\nWe don't wanna save the recovery,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n338\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.920\nexit from the demo.\n\n339\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.550\nWe don't really care about the website,\nso we'll get out of there.\n\n340\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.050\nWhat about another tool, right?\n\n341\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.560\nSomething like a data recovery,\nanother data recovery tool.\n\n342\n00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.960\nEaseUS or EaseUS,\ndepending on how you pronounce it.\n\n343\n00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:58.053\nSo we can go in, we can look for\nall this kind of data right here.\n\n344\n00:15:58.053 --> 00:16:02.581\nSo you'll see we have the ability\nto scan all file types, graphics,\n\n345\n00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:06.735\ndocuments, email, audio,\nvideo, and/or other, right?\n\n346\n00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:08.697\nSo we can go in, we can do that.\n\n347\n00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:13.380\nWe'll grab that, we can go, and\ngo to the same drive, the E drive.\n\n348\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.970\nNotice, by the way, remember I\nmentioned in one of the prior episodes,\n\n349\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.750\nthere's often hidden recovery\npartitions that we don't always see.\n\n350\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.970\nBut notice that this one picked up\nthe system-reserved partition and\n\n351\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.310\nactually sees it there,\nmarks it lost disk drive, but\n\n352\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.660\nI can actually search the system\npartition, even though it's not available\n\n353\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.180\nto me, I don't normally see\nit using a tool like this.\n\n354\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.780\nSo again, a recovery partition which\nis pretty common today, right.\n\n355\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.350\nMost vendors will put recovery\npartitions into their systems.\n\n356\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.960\nI can actually go in, and I can search.\n\n357\n00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.546\nAll right, so I can go in and take a look,\nand if I do that I can go in and\n\n358\n00:16:47.546 --> 00:16:53.138\nI can find, there we go,\nI can find that in the recovery partition.\n\n359\n00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.500\nAnd, again, it's recovery partition.\n\n360\n00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.368\nThere's really not gonna be anything there\nout of the ordinary just recovery tools,\n\n361\n00:16:58.368 --> 00:17:01.710\nright, that Windows creates, but\nyou can see that I have up under there.\n\n362\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.270\nI have a boot partition, or boot folder.\n\n363\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.060\nI have system volume information.\n\n364\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.920\nThere's a log file in there.\n\n365\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.930\nI got more lost files.\n\n366\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.340\nThere's some true type font files,\ncuz those are really important.\n\n367\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.280\nYou wanna take a look at those.\n\n368\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, necessary.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.210\nBut I can go in potentially.\n\n370\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.340\nI can preview the tracking log.\n\n371\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.973\nNow the log file, the tracking\nlog of the recovery partitions,\n\n372\n00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:22.780\nthere's usually not stuff in there.\n\n373\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.350\nYou can really read when we go in.\n\n374\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.985\nWe take a look at the format in there.\n\n375\n00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:28.590\nIt's got some machine language garbage\nin there that we're not gonna be able to\n\n376\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.410\ndecipher.\n\n377\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.810\nBut the idea is I can preview these files.\n\n378\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.850\nI can also recover them if I choose to,\nright, by going in and\n\n379\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.060\nactually clicking on one of the files.\n\n380\n00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.120\nSo I can drill in, right, and I can\nactually see the information that's there.\n\n381\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.540\nThere's a BCD log file, right, so I may be\nable to go in and preview what's in there.\n\n382\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.860\nThat's got some interesting\ninformation in it, right.\n\n383\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.630\nSo if I wanna recover that,\nI can go ahead and grab that file.\n\n384\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.080\nAnd let's put that,\nthat's gonna wind up going in C drive.\n\n385\n00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.110\nLet's throw that up on the desktop,\njust be easier to deal with that, okay.\n\n386\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.540\nAnd then recovery completed,\nall right, so we'll click OK.\n\n387\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.980\nGreat, let's just get rid of that, right.\n\n388\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.914\nThis is the problem with demo software.\n\n389\n00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:13.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.050\n&gt;&gt; You got a million screens\nyou don't normally wanna see.\n\n391\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.980\nWhen you buy the software you get rid\nof all the craziness about hey let\n\n392\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.100\nme sell you something.\n\n393\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.900\nAnd it just does its job,\nit's a lot easier.\n\n394\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.910\nBut when we zoom in on the desktop,\nwhat we'll see is, BCD.LOG.\n\n395\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.190\nThat file I recovered\nis sitting right there.\n\n396\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.150\nAnd like any other file, we can go\nahead and just do an Open With on that.\n\n397\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.366\nUse the Swiss Army knife of networking and\nrecovery professionals, right, Mr.\n\n398\n00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:37.100\nNotepad.\n\n399\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.280\nNow again, it's a log file from Windows.\n\n400\n00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.990\nWe're not gonna be able to read\na lot of this stuff, right.\n\n401\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.150\nA lot of this is in a format that's just\nnot gonna make sense to us conceptually.\n\n402\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.290\nBut there is English stuff in\nthere we can kinda pick out.\n\n403\n00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.215\nIt's got device hard drive boot\nvolume information, things like that.\n\n404\n00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.800\nBut you could see,\nI did actually recover the files.\n\n405\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.310\nIt's just that, obviously, it's not a Word\ndocument with a bunch of stuff in it.\n\n406\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.210\nIt's just that.\n\n407\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.830\nBut what we could do, is go in.\n\n408\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.590\nLet's just see if we can do this.\n\n409\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.400\nInstead of doing this,\nlet's just run this one more time.\n\n410\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.000\nWe'll go in and\nwe'll target that E drive and\n\n411\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.170\nwe'll take a look at\nthe Word documents there.\n\n412\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.800\nSo we'll open the tool one more time.\n\n413\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.780\nLet's this time scan it.\n\n414\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.770\nI just wanted to show you that we could\nactually pull that recovery partition in,\n\n415\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.710\nand even though it's not available\nnormally we can parcel the tool like this.\n\n416\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.480\nWhich is, again, pretty valuable\nwhen you think about it, right.\n\n417\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.630\nI mean, if you think about\nthe access that grants us.\n\n418\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.640\nSo let's go after that E drive, all right.\n\n419\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.820\nLet's go see what's in there.\n\n420\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.140\nSo we got some temp information.\n\n421\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.880\nLooks like there's some stuff there.\n\n422\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.940\nWe got the Recycle Bin.\n\n423\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.180\nBut notice it didn't find the secret\ndata file and the Word documents, right.\n\n424\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.090\nBecause that had been already deleted.\n\n425\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.790\nAnd so it just depends on\nthe nature of the tool and\n\n426\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.000\nwhat the tool is designed to do.\n\n427\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.260\nSome tools will find that data,\nother tools,\n\n428\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.830\nif it's not designed to look at that\nspecific information, may not find it.\n\n429\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.140\nAnd this is the reason that we wanna\nuse more than one tool to examine\n\n430\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.240\nall the different data.\n\n431\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.830\nBecause you'll notice it's looking for\ngraphics, audio, documents,\n\n432\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.570\nvideo, email, other, etc.\n\n433\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.025\nIt's looking for all this but\nit's not gonna find, in my case, it's not\n\n434\n00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:11.706\ngonna find the data that I deleted because\nthis tool isn't designed to look for\n\n435\n00:20:11.706 --> 00:20:12.628\nthat kind of data.\n\n436\n00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.425\nSo we have to know, right,\n\n437\n00:20:14.425 --> 00:20:18.350\nand we have to understand what\nthe tool is capable of doing.\n\n438\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.490\nAnd this is why we use a variety of tools.\n\n439\n00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.770\nWe've talked about this idea\nof creating a toolkit, right.\n\n440\n00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.645\nWhere we have multiple tools\nthat will allow us to do this.\n\n441\n00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:27.765\nNow, it says, hey,\nwe just did a normal scan.\n\n442\n00:20:27.765 --> 00:20:29.875\nDo you wanna do a deep\nscan to find more files?\n\n443\n00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.865\nWell maybe it'll find them with deep scan,\nright.\n\n444\n00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:33.675\nWe don't know, so let's try a deep scan.\n\n445\n00:20:33.675 --> 00:20:34.925\nLet's let it go through, and\n\n446\n00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:39.132\nwe're gonna see that there is more data,\nmore information there.\n\n447\n00:20:39.132 --> 00:20:40.842\nIt may find more stuff.\n\n448\n00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:42.632\nIt still finds the Recycle Bin.\n\n449\n00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:43.322\nStill finds it.\n\n450\n00:20:43.322 --> 00:20:44.822\nNow there is secret there.\n\n451\n00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:47.332\nIt looks like there's a secret\ndata file that is secret.\n\n452\n00:20:47.332 --> 00:20:51.689\nBut it doesn't, let's just wait\na second and let that come back in.\n\n453\n00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:56.870\nLet's do that right there.\n\n454\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.540\nOkay, so there's the secret data file.\n\n455\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.979\nIt does find it but notice it doesn't\nfind the Word documents inside of it.\n\n456\n00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:04.960\nAgain, it depends on\nthe nature of the tool.\n\n457\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.610\nIt found the data file but it didn't find\nthe data sitting inside of the data file.\n\n458\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.810\nNot every tool is gonna find\neverything all the time.\n\n459\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.799\nAnd so you have to understand\nthat building that toolkit, and\n\n460\n00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:21.535\nfinding tools that you feel are pretty\nvaluable and that work consistently in\n\n461\n00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:25.173\na way that you're comfortable with,\nright, would be a good idea for you.\n\n462\n00:21:25.173 --> 00:21:28.363\nSome tools are good for certain things,\nothers maybe not so much.\n\n463\n00:21:28.363 --> 00:21:30.073\nNot saying that's not a good tool,\n\n464\n00:21:30.073 --> 00:21:33.721\njust pointing out it's a free version\nof a tool and it does some basic stuff,\n\n465\n00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:37.205\nbut clearly there's another free tool\nwe looked at that find more data.\n\n466\n00:21:37.205 --> 00:21:39.297\nSo it's a question of mixing and matching,\n\n467\n00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:42.700\ntrying to figure out what is the best\npossible organization around it.\n\n468\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.630\nBut keep in mind,\n\n469\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.215\nthis tool found the recovery partition\nwhereas the other tool did not.\n\n470\n00:21:47.215 --> 00:21:50.130\nSo again, it may be a question of\nmixing and matching certain tools.\n\n471\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.550\n&gt;&gt; Adam, would you say, typically, you'll\nfind yourself using multiple tools even if\n\n472\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:59.400\nyou trust that maybe it's a fully paid\nversion professional type of software.\n\n473\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.000\nYou find yourself using multiple tools of\nthe same ilk that do the same kind of job,\n\n474\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.940\njust to verify that\nconsistency across the board.\n\n475\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.990\n&gt;&gt; I find that I will often go through and\ntest a variety of tools.\n\n476\n00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.290\nI have kind of a toolkit,\n\n477\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.110\na set of tools I have come to rely\non that I built over years that I\n\n478\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.410\nknow pretty much I can use for this,\nthis, or this in this circumstance.\n\n479\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.180\nAnd so I am always looking to\nadd tools to that toolkit.\n\n480\n00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.200\nI'm always looking for tools that are,\nand again let me be clear,\n\n481\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.650\nit's not just that I don't\nwanna spend money for tools,\n\n482\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.760\nI own a lot of tools that\nare very expensive, right.\n\n483\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.590\nBut the reality is, if could find a tool\nthat does the job without having to spend\n\n484\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.208\nmy client's money, then that's just\na good common sense thing that I have\n\n485\n00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:41.660\na responsibility to do as\na security professional.\n\n486\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.784\nSo I'm always testing and\nevaluating tools.\n\n487\n00:22:43.784 --> 00:22:48.310\nBut one of the nice things about it,\nin this environment doing what we do,\n\n488\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.780\nwhen you get to certain point you\ncan talk to a vendor and say listen,\n\n489\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.936\nhere's the deal,\nthis is what I do for a living.\n\n490\n00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:57.670\nI've got these kinds of clients, I wanna\nsee if your tools are really gonna work\n\n491\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.210\nfor me, and if it is I wanna recommend\nit to clients but I gotta figure it out.\n\n492\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.530\nA lot of times you can work with a vendor,\nthey'll give you an NFR, not for\n\n493\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.370\nretail copy that you can play with.\n\n494\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.700\nGet a sense of the tool, and then if\nthe tool makes sense I'll recommend it to\n\n495\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.900\nmy customer and say hey, if you want this\ntool and you wanna be able to use it.\n\n496\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.530\nThis is what you have to do, if not,\nthen we could do it another way.\n\n497\n00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.990\nThe choice is yours, right.\n\n498\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.980\nBut I often find that I will do a lot\nof testing and a lot of evaluating, and\n\n499\n00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.320\nsometimes vendors will contact me and\nsay hey, we want you to test the tool.\n\n500\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.210\nWe think it's good, if you think\nit's good maybe you'll recommend it,\n\n501\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.300\ncan you test it and look at it.\n\n502\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.340\nSo it really just depends,\nbut yeah I do a lot of both.\n\n503\n00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.474\nI have a lot of tools that I use that\nare free because of the teaching I do.\n\n504\n00:23:36.474 --> 00:23:37.902\nI always wanna recommend this to students.\n\n505\n00:23:37.902 --> 00:23:39.590\nI wanna always have an ability and\n\n506\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.480\na way for students to do these things\nwithout spending a lot of money.\n\n507\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.930\nAnd so I always wanna look for\nthose opportunities.\n\n508\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.340\nBut I also have a lot of tools that\nliterally I pull off the shelf and\n\n509\n00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.110\nsay wow, here you go.\n\n510\n00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.390\nHere's a $500 tool or whatever it is.\n\n511\n00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.130\nBut I'm also always on the lookout.\n\n512\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.430\nAnd students, and colleagues and\n\n513\n00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.700\ncustomers are always coming back\nsaying hey, did you hear about this?\n\n514\n00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.628\nDid you hear about that?\n\n515\n00:23:58.628 --> 00:24:01.370\nAnd I'm always getting information from\npeople to help me better understand\n\n516\n00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.053\nwhat's going on.\n\n517\n00:24:02.053 --> 00:24:03.810\nSo it's a mixed and matched kind of thing.\n\n518\n00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.996\nThere's a lot of different\nTools that we can use,\n\n519\n00:24:05.996 --> 00:24:08.555\nI've got a list of some tools I\nknow we put in the show list.\n\n520\n00:24:08.555 --> 00:24:10.820\nWe'll take a look at a couple\nof them on the Windows side.\n\n521\n00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.340\nPut a bunch of Linux tools in there for\n\n522\n00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.370\nyou, just to help you\nfigure that out as well.\n\n523\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.810\nLet's just go back we'll take a look\nreal quick in the environment here,\n\n524\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.940\ngot another tool up for you, this is\ncalled Power Data Recovery mini tool.\n\n525\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.260\nRight?\nSo, again it does the basic kinda stuff\n\n526\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.220\nundelete recovery,\ndamaged partition recovery,\n\n527\n00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.220\nlost partition recovery, digital media\nrecovery, that kinda nice, CD recovery.\n\n528\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.550\nYes if we do undelete recovery,\n\n529\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.670\nright we go in I'd already runned this or\nI could go ahead and run it again.\n\n530\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.750\nLet's just run it again,\nwe'll do this thing real quick.\n\n531\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.394\nHit recover, just to show you what\nthe process looks like, because I ran and\n\n532\n00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:47.880\njust to have it already set up,\nbut it doesn't take very long.\n\n533\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.874\nSo we can go and build a list here,\nyou'll see that we're able to go in,\n\n534\n00:24:51.874 --> 00:24:57.470\nkind of drill down Just\nscroll over a little bit.\n\n535\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.750\nAnd you can see we've got\nsome different directories,\n\n536\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.900\nfind some different things,\nprogram files, right?\n\n537\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.150\nThere's a tool that,\nthe data recovery tool, right?\n\n538\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.580\nThere's, under Users,\ngot some information there.\n\n539\n00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.520\nApp data, right?\n\n540\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.650\nWe can kind of drill down.\n\n541\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.180\nSo it's finding certain\nthings in the C drive.\n\n542\n00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:21.040\nIf I go back and I Take a look, right?\n\n543\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.690\nIt's only finding the c drive.\n\n544\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.370\nIt's not mounting the e drive as you\ncan see, I may have to go in and\n\n545\n00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.890\nagain, get the full value of the tool.\n\n546\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.060\nThis is a free tool.\n\n547\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.800\nIt may only find the system partition.\n\n548\n00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.360\nIt may not find other partitions So\nyou have to be aware of that right and\n\n549\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.120\nyou know kind of play with it.\n\n550\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.620\nIf I do lost partition so\nthere I can see the e drive it's just not\n\n551\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.760\nfinding it under the original area so\nI can go kind of find\n\n552\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.920\nit a different way just kind of play with\nit but I can tell by the size what it is.\n\n553\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.700\nSo we'll grab that one\nhit recovery on that.\n\n554\n00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.700\nIt's doing a full scan.\n\n555\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.130\nIt's looking for the FAT boot records,\nand all that information.\n\n556\n00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.270\nJust kinda zoom in there,\nso you could see that, so\n\n557\n00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.030\nyou could see what it's doing, right?\n\n558\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.090\nSo you could see HFS, NTFS.\n\n559\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.605\nIt's scanning all All the different\nfile systems looking for\n\n560\n00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:07.045\nboot information there.\n\n561\n00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:08.185\nSo we could see that.\n\n562\n00:26:08.185 --> 00:26:08.835\nIt's come back.\n\n563\n00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:10.885\nIt's found two partitions there.\n\n564\n00:26:10.885 --> 00:26:14.665\nSo let's do that one, right.\n\n565\n00:26:14.665 --> 00:26:16.895\nAnd let's do a show file on that one.\n\n566\n00:26:16.895 --> 00:26:19.605\nIt's gonna come back and\nshow me the files there.\n\n567\n00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:22.175\nSo again, what does it find, right?\n\n568\n00:26:22.175 --> 00:26:26.160\nWell May find variety of different things,\nkinda open that up.\n\n569\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.380\nLooks like it found a bunch\nof temp files in there.\n\n570\n00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:35.270\nIt's got some different information,\nand loss files, all right.\n\n571\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.350\nIt finds the desktop INI, but again,\nit doesn't seem to find the secret\n\n572\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.790\ndata folder and it doesn't find the Word\ndocuments that we know are there But\n\n573\n00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.380\nit's just not finding them.\n\n574\n00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.700\nAgain it depends on the nature of\nthe tool and what it's looking for.\n\n575\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.240\nSo you have different tools,\nwe'll find different things.\n\n576\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.710\nThis is about lost partitions,\nnot about lost files.\n\n577\n00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.260\nRight, so I'm gonna have to\nuse a different version or\n\n578\n00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:01.980\ndifferent item in the tool to be able to\ngo and Kind of work our way back, right?\n\n579\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I might be handicapped but\nbecause of the demo version.\n\n580\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.130\n&gt;&gt; You know well, sometimes it depends but\nthis one doesn't have a specific file\n\n581\n00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.670\nrecovery option, it's just recovering\nmainly partitions, so it depends on\n\n582\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.940\nthe need for the tool Because it'll\nrecover general data but it may not drill\n\n583\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.050\ndown to find everything, depends on\nthe tool and how the tool works.\n\n584\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.930\nAgain, just illustrating the idea to you\nthat, thank you, illustrating the idea to\n\n585\n00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.790\nyou that it's important to have\ndifferent tools for different jobs.\n\n586\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.880\nThere's one more,\nactually two more I want to look at,\n\n587\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.790\none of them is Access Data FTK Imager,\nthis one allows us to load up an image and\n\n588\n00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.130\nyou can see I've got an image\nthat's already loaded here.\n\n589\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:42.060\nAnd allow us to go in and to find all\nsorts of stuff.You know I can find\n\n590\n00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.500\npictures that are in here,\nI can find song files,\n\n591\n00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.935\nI can find video files, I can find\nunallocted space and look at unallocted.\n\n592\n00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.655\nIndicated space that's sitting right here,\nso\n\n593\n00:27:52.655 --> 00:27:56.815\nI can see all the unallocated information,\nI can load up, so\n\n594\n00:27:56.815 --> 00:28:00.045\nif we had evidence item in,\nlet's load up our image file, right?\n\n595\n00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:04.115\nSo, we're just loading up a sample,\nanother sample one, let's go in\n\n596\n00:28:06.415 --> 00:28:10.645\nand let's load up the following,\nwhere do we put our image file there?\n\n597\n00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:14.300\nAt the route right there,\nitprotvscratch.arc.\n\n598\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.670\nLet's load that up,\nlet's see if it can read that.\n\n599\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.800\nLet's see what kind of information,\nunrecognized file system.\n\n600\n00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.870\nYou'll see here when we load the ark\nfile right out of the other tool,\n\n601\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.520\nit doesn't recognize the image.\n\n602\n00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.590\nIt's gotta be this tool\nnormally works with dd.\n\n603\n00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.340\nImage files, right?\n\n604\n00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.790\nSo if we use dd to be able\nto create an image in Linux,\n\n605\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.870\nwe then can actually load it up here.\n\n606\n00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:40.160\nOr if we use another imaging tool that\nprovides an image in that format,\n\n607\n00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.880\nwe can load it up.\n\n608\n00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.400\nSo the first image I loaded Was an image\ntype that would allow us to see it.\n\n609\n00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.490\nBut the standard image that we built\ndoesn't always work with every tool.\n\n610\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.350\nAnd again,\nthat's something else to consider.\n\n611\n00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.530\nNot every image type is available\nto be used with every tool.\n\n612\n00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.870\nAnd that's another lesson that we\nwanna know and wanna learn and\n\n613\n00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.740\nwanna kinda take to heart as we do this\nkinda work, is that certain image types or\n\n614\n00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.890\nfiles are used by certain tools.\n\n615\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.920\nShouldn't be a surprise, right?\n\n616\n00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.700\nThis is pretty standard for us.\n\n617\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.280\nBut a tool like Access Data FTK Is gonna\nrequire a certain kind of image and\n\n618\n00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.430\nthat kind of image file is not\nnecessarily the standard one we create\n\n619\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.180\nwith a tool like Rdrive Image.\n\n620\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.440\nAnd so we do have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n621\n00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.215\nWe definitely can go in and\nwe definitely can look at files.\n\n622\n00:29:21.215 --> 00:29:24.575\nBut we have to make sure the image type\nmatches up to the type of the tool.\n\n623\n00:29:24.575 --> 00:29:27.615\nAnd the tool type, or rather,\nthe tool image file that we expect.\n\n624\n00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:30.595\nSo that's just something else\nto consider and think about.\n\n625\n00:29:30.595 --> 00:29:35.025\nSo just some things to show you by way\nof which we want to kind of take away,\n\n626\n00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:39.065\nin our mind, the thought process that not\nall drive imaging tools are the same.\n\n627\n00:29:39.065 --> 00:29:41.080\nNot all image viewing tools are the same.\n\n628\n00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.370\nAnd again it's up to the forensic\nexaminer to match these two together and\n\n629\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.480\nunderstand them and\nunderstand how to use them.\n\n630\n00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.510\nAnd understand what we can take away from\na set of tools and images and what we\n\n631\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:54.190\nmay be able to find or what may not be\nthere based on how we use the image.\n\n632\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.060\nWe do have a list of tools that\nI put into the show notes, but\n\n633\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.520\nI wanna demo just a couple more tools for\nyou that are part of that list.\n\n634\n00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.230\nI've shown you a lot of Windows tools, let\nme just, Bring the command line back up.\n\n635\n00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.750\nShow you another one\nthat's kinda interesting,\n\n636\n00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.610\na command line tool called system info.\n\n637\n00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:15.530\nAnd so system info right there, we can\nuse with this switch and this command.\n\n638\n00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.680\nAnd when we do this, and\nwe'll give it a second to load up,\n\n639\n00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.930\nwe're gonna get a listing of\nall the system information.\n\n640\n00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:26.040\nAnd you could see here host name,\nthe build of the OS, manufacturer,\n\n641\n00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.750\nconfiguration etc.\n\n642\n00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.200\nIt's gonna go through, give us memory,\ngive us all the information.\n\n643\n00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.340\nNow, can we get that kind of information\nout of a Windows system generically?\n\n644\n00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.490\nCould we go and use the system info\nfrom the system information command from\n\n645\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.170\nthe run line and\nbring up the system information window?\n\n646\n00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.260\nThe MS Info 32 window.\n\n647\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.380\nAbsolutely.\nWe can do that.\n\n648\n00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.510\nIt's just another way of doing\nthis from the command line.\n\n649\n00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:52.940\nBut if you're not familiar with system\ninfo, what do we tell you to do?\n\n650\n00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.785\nPut in the command.\n\n651\n00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.960\n/help, look for the help file.\n\n652\n00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.010\nAgain, this is a built in Windows command,\nit's there,\n\n653\n00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.530\nall you have to do is read the help file.\n\n654\n00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.190\nAt the command prompt just do help and\nyou'll find this.\n\n655\n00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:07.020\nThere are a lot of system tools that\nare built in, but we've also talked about\n\n656\n00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.120\nthe system turtles tools, a system\nturtles tool that does the same thing,\n\n657\n00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.350\npsinfo, right,\nwill give us that same information.\n\n658\n00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.360\nCentrally, as you can see there.\n\n659\n00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.760\nPulls the same kinda system\ninformation out for us.\n\n660\n00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.180\nSo just some things to think about.\n\n661\n00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.080\nWe've talked about things\nlike ps uptime for\n\n662\n00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.670\nuptime, we've talked about net statistics.\n\n663\n00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.990\nIn Linux there are a lot of tools, and\nI put them into the show notes for you.\n\n664\n00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:35.560\nBut tools like, cat, uname,\nuptime, top, wps, ls,\n\n665\n00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:41.150\nlsof, check config,\ninittab, wholast, lastlog,\n\n666\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:46.810\nwhat else, shadow and password, right,\nto take a look at password files.\n\n667\n00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.170\nIfconfig instead of ipconfig for\nIP information.\n\n668\n00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.359\nWe talked about dd to create image files.\n\n669\n00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:56.500\nDCFLDD some forensically surround version\nof dd lets you create copies using\n\n670\n00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.614\nthe forensically sound methodology.\n\n671\n00:31:58.614 --> 00:32:02.668\nThere's all these tools that are available\nboth in Windows and in Linux.\n\n672\n00:32:02.668 --> 00:32:05.770\nThat let you do the same thing, and it's\njust the matter of understanding the tools\n\n673\n00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.970\nand going through them and\ninteracting with them.\n\n674\n00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.250\nBut all of these tools, almost for that\nexception, either from the command line or\n\n675\n00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:16.210\nfrom the GUI can be used to capture data\nto create an image to then restore that in\n\n676\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.720\ntheory, if we parse that image and\nunderstand how to manipulate it.\n\n677\n00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.910\nWhen we statically or whether we're\ndoing live data or static data,\n\n678\n00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.690\nfollow the standard methodology we've\ntalked about to capture information, and\n\n679\n00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.780\ndo so in a forensically sound way.\n\n680\n00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.610\nWe're gonna then be able to produce this\ndata and interact with it but the nice\n\n681\n00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.190\nthing is we can go back to it time and\nagain because it's offline, right?\n\n682\n00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.280\nIt's captured from the original, but\nwe now have static copies that we can use\n\n683\n00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.750\nthat are frozen essentially at that moment\nin time but they're forensically sound.\n\n684\n00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.380\nWe can go in and we can use them with\ntools like we been showing you here.\n\n685\n00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.290\nLoad them up, examine those files,\ngo through in great detail and\n\n686\n00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.440\nunderstand what's there.\n\n687\n00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.560\nOne other way to examine a hard drive and\nlets just take a look at this because this\n\n688\n00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.180\nalso kind of interesting,\na tool called Disk Explorer.\n\n689\n00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.570\nThis is actually a disk editor.\n\n690\n00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.470\nThis lets us go in\na slightly different way.\n\n691\n00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.250\nThis is not gonna be, hey let me look\nat the image and really drill down,\n\n692\n00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.030\nbut rather, let's go in and\nreally look at the bytes and sectors,\n\n693\n00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.970\nthe allocation units\nthat are on the drive.\n\n694\n00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.400\nSo let's open this tool up,\nrun time software brings us this tool.\n\n695\n00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.040\nWe can open this up and we can actually\ndrill into a NTFS partition as you can see\n\n696\n00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.100\nhere and we can begin to go\nthrough the partition table.\n\n697\n00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.610\nWe can forwards and backwards and we're\njust parsing through here one partition,\n\n698\n00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.260\none sector rather on the partition,\none section at a time.\n\n699\n00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.430\nLet me just scroll in so you can see this.\n\n700\n00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:38.374\nBut you could see the sector map on, the\nextreme left up there and you'll see that,\n\n701\n00:33:38.374 --> 00:33:42.556\nI'm in sector 000000044 and\nI'm looking at information.\n\n702\n00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:46.982\nNow it says invalid across there in the\npartition for some reading of virtual hard\n\n703\n00:33:46.982 --> 00:33:50.773\ndrive on my machine, this is a VM\nwe are running again just remember.\n\n704\n00:33:50.773 --> 00:33:54.318\nSo the tool although it shows it to us\ndoesn't necessarily like what it seeing\n\n705\n00:33:54.318 --> 00:33:57.589\nwhen you do this on a real physical\nmachine with a physical hard drive you\n\n706\n00:33:57.589 --> 00:34:00.716\nwon't get that little invalid stamp\nacross there just so you know.\n\n707\n00:34:00.716 --> 00:34:04.224\nThe drive is perfectly valid it's just\nnot liking the format the VHDX format of\n\n708\n00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:07.946\nthe hard drive as supposed to an actual\nreal physical drive, that's the reason and\n\n709\n00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:08.927\nit marks it that way.\n\n710\n00:34:08.927 --> 00:34:12.424\nBut the drive information itself\nis perfectly legitimate and so\n\n711\n00:34:12.424 --> 00:34:15.630\nwe're seeing information\npartition by partition.\n\n712\n00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.742\nI can also go in,\n\n713\n00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:21.825\nI can go to the little guy that looks like\nhe's walking up there in the blue and\n\n714\n00:34:21.825 --> 00:34:26.730\nthe yellow little square between\nthe fast forward and rewind arrows.\n\n715\n00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.120\nAnd I can jump to a sector\nposition on the hard drive.\n\n716\n00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.200\nI can actually type in an individual\nsector and I can actually go as you can\n\n717\n00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.360\nsee here and I can jump to a specific\nspace on the hard drive looking for data.\n\n718\n00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.030\nSo if I look at the drive geometry\nI can actually drill in and\n\n719\n00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.960\nI can look at specific information\nin one or more of the sectors and\n\n720\n00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.320\nlook at bytes of data that\nare actually stored there.\n\n721\n00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.030\nRemember we said, 512 bytes typically for\nan individual sector cluster,\n\n722\n00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:58.510\nmultiple allocation, right, the allocation\nunit, cluster multiple sectors together.\n\n723\n00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.490\nWe can actually begin to go sector by\nsector dissecting what's in that hard\n\n724\n00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.430\ndrive looking for that information\nin real time using a tool like this.\n\n725\n00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.610\nAnd that actually allows us to jump right\nto that and then start to drill down and\n\n726\n00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.620\nlook for data.\n\n727\n00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.860\nAnd I can just scroll through here, right?\n\n728\n00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.350\nAnd as I do, I'm looking at information.\n\n729\n00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.660\nThis information all here is marked as no.\n\n730\n00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.330\nIt's not a boot sector, right?\n\n731\n00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:27.165\nAnd we've got information in here and\nit's just showing me as I go down,\n\n732\n00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:29.375\nwhat's there, and\nit's just changing the map and\n\n733\n00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:34.435\nshowing me all of the various as I go,\njust all the various information.\n\n734\n00:35:34.435 --> 00:35:37.685\nIf we go all the way back up to\nthe very top of the drive, right?\n\n735\n00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:41.415\nVery first sector,\nall zeros by zero at the top and\n\n736\n00:35:41.415 --> 00:35:46.760\nwe look over here, and we see that\nentry number one, system NTFS boot yes.\n\n737\n00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.760\nThat's the boot sector for\nthe drive right there.\n\n738\n00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.040\nThat's how we actually boot that machine\nand hard drive up, or that rather tells us\n\n739\n00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.560\nhow the hard drive is set up to able to\nboot and to load the operating system.\n\n740\n00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.880\nSo we're able to see\nthe boot sector right there,\n\n741\n00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.680\nit's always gonna be the first\nspot on the hard drive.\n\n742\n00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.164\nAnd so we can read that, and\nwe can from there start to drill down and\n\n743\n00:36:05.164 --> 00:36:06.988\nunderstand all the information.\n\n744\n00:36:06.988 --> 00:36:11.860\nNow this is Information and\n\n745\n00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.090\nthis is a methodology in terms\nof using a tool like this\n\n746\n00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.870\nthat you have to get some\nadditional training on, right?\n\n747\n00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.590\nTo understand what you're looking at here\nwith the cylinder, the head, the sector,\n\n748\n00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.420\nthe starting ending point,\nthe relative and total sectors,\n\n749\n00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.110\nthese are references to information\nmapping points on the hard drive.\n\n750\n00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.900\nWhen we went and\ntalked about hard disks and\n\n751\n00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.570\nfile systems episodes we actually\ntalked about the building blocks here.\n\n752\n00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.690\nWe talked about the cylinder, the head,\nthe sector, we referenced all that.\n\n753\n00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.250\nBut we didn't really go into\nhow are they actually set up,\n\n754\n00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.660\nwhat's the actual addressing or\nmapping convention that's used,\n\n755\n00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.560\nand how do we then look at information.\n\n756\n00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.740\nIt's a little bit out beyond a course\nlike this, in a discussion like this in\n\n757\n00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.280\nterms of what we're doing,\nit's really more about going in and\n\n758\n00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.090\ndoing some deep dive forensics\nwork on hard drive investigation.\n\n759\n00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.620\nBut you begin to see what somebody\nthat will use a tool like this\n\n760\n00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.090\nto be able to do this kinda\nwork is gonna start to look at.\n\n761\n00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.560\nThey're gonna start to look for\nthis information and go through here.\n\n762\n00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.960\nIn here,\nwe have the ability to do a search.\n\n763\n00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.500\nWe have the ability to be able to,\nlet me just scroll in so\n\n764\n00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.900\nyou can see some of the tools here.\n\n765\n00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.580\nWe could do a search in the system.\n\n766\n00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.700\nWe can create a virtual volume form here.\n\n767\n00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.700\nWe can find files and recover them.\n\n768\n00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.090\nWe can create an image file.\n\n769\n00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.840\nWe can do a lot of stuff using a tool\nlike this against the hard drive and\n\n770\n00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.920\nallow ourselves to be able to\nfind information that is going to\n\n771\n00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.950\nbe very valuable for\nus as we do an analysis.\n\n772\n00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.730\nSo tools like this that allow us to\ngo in and look at NTFS partitions,\n\n773\n00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.870\nand there are the equivalent for\nFAT as well.\n\n774\n00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.850\nWould be very valuable for\nus to be able to use, and\n\n775\n00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:43.280\nto refine the information, or essentially\nscoping and tailoring to look at\n\n776\n00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.540\nwhat's there in to figure out how\nwe can examine that information.\n\n777\n00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.740\nWhether as I was mentioning,\nit's a static or\n\n778\n00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.850\na dynamic piece of information\nwe're capturing, we have to follow\n\n779\n00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.005\nthe appropriate methodology as we have\ndiscussed and as we've talked about.\n\n780\n00:37:55.005 --> 00:37:58.320\nAnd remember, there are differences\nin the file systems between FAT and\n\n781\n00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.360\nNTFS, we did in the Windows\nforensics sessions,\n\n782\n00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.120\nI think in part five if I remember\ncorrectly, or part four, one of the two.\n\n783\n00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.500\nWe did the recycle bin demonstration\nwhere we did recycle bin forensics,\n\n784\n00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.850\nshowed you how to drill\nin to the Recycle Bin.\n\n785\n00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:16.650\nDid that on a Windows 10 machine,\nshowed you how to recover data from within\n\n786\n00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:22.168\nthe recycle bin by using the Rifiuti tool\nor whatever, however you pronounce it.\n\n787\n00:38:22.168 --> 00:38:26.070\nBut the Rifiuti tool to be able to go in\nand drill down into the recycle bin, so\n\n788\n00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.510\nrecycle bin forensics on NTFS partitions.\n\n789\n00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.878\nHere we can also do a lot of\nstuff in the MAC OS, in Linux.\n\n790\n00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:36.237\nWe don't wanna ignore those\noperating systems, right?\n\n791\n00:38:36.237 --> 00:38:41.335\nWhen we think about the Mac OSX operating\nsystem or just in general Mac OS.\n\n792\n00:38:41.335 --> 00:38:45.245\nIf we move files to the trash folder,\nthat's essentially the recycle bin, right?\n\n793\n00:38:45.245 --> 00:38:49.025\nAnd so we use the same kind of fault\nprocess with a tool like Rifiuti\n\n794\n00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:51.890\nto be able to go in and look at that and\nI mentioned when we did the demo that we\n\n795\n00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.350\ncould do this on Windows, on Linux,\non Macintosh systems using the same tool.\n\n796\n00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.275\nWe could also use tools like machine and\nRemo.\n\n797\n00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:02.780\nThere's Remo recover,\nthere is also something called Mac keeper,\n\n798\n00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.085\nwhich are forensics tools on the Mac that\ncan be used to drill in to a Mac system.\n\n799\n00:39:07.085 --> 00:39:09.250\nSo some tools you wanna take a look there.\n\n800\n00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.950\nIn Linux remember,\nwe use a deletion concept.\n\n801\n00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.940\nWe go in and we use the bin RM.\n\n802\n00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.630\nSo remove, right?\n\n803\n00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:20.280\nFile or remove command from Linux.\n\n804\n00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.390\nSo if we delete files using RM,\nthey remain on the disk and\n\n805\n00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.370\nare recoverable, right?\n\n806\n00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.350\nSo they're in the sub directory bin RM.\n\n807\n00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.970\nWe can go and look for them there.\n\n808\n00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.550\nWe can go in and we can take a look and\n\n809\n00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.920\npull them back using\na tool like that also.\n\n810\n00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.250\nSo we wanna keep that in mind.\n\n811\n00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.990\nAnd understand that there's lots\nof different ways to go ahead and\n\n812\n00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.600\nfind this information.\n\n813\n00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.070\nIt's not just about Windows but\nit is primarily about Windows.\n\n814\n00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.565\nIn the sense that this is one of the main\noperating systems that we will often\n\n815\n00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:46.961\nsee and have to investigate.\n\n816\n00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:50.539\nBut I can tell you that for every one\nMacIntosh or Linux machine I have to do\n\n817\n00:39:50.539 --> 00:39:54.471\nan investigation on, there's probably\nfive or ten Windows machine, right,\n\n818\n00:39:54.471 --> 00:39:57.191\nmore often than not that fall\ninto that same category.\n\n819\n00:39:57.191 --> 00:40:00.387\nSo it's not that you don't get to operate\non these other operating systems,\n\n820\n00:40:00.387 --> 00:40:02.861\ninteract with them But\nit's that you don't do it as often.\n\n821\n00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:05.878\nAnd so, while you always wanna be aware\nof the tools, you wanna practice them,\n\n822\n00:40:05.878 --> 00:40:07.062\nyou wanna interact them them.\n\n823\n00:40:07.062 --> 00:40:09.701\nUnless you specialize in Mac or\nspecialize in Linux,\n\n824\n00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:12.518\nyou're probably gonna spend\nthe majority of your time,\n\n825\n00:40:12.518 --> 00:40:16.640\nas you have often seen or we've talked\nabout, working in a Windows environment.\n\n826\n00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.980\nAnd so, understanding more\nabout the Windows tools and\n\n827\n00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.200\njust making sure you're\nfamiliar with them,\n\n828\n00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.560\nputs you in a good place to start down\nthe road towards becoming a CHFI.\n\n829\n00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.180\nKeep in mind that in an exam for CHFI,\n\n830\n00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.080\nwhile there's always the possibility that\nyou'll get asked about this or that tool.\n\n831\n00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.290\nThe reality is if it's a kind of off in\nthe corner tool that is used for a highly\n\n832\n00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.380\nspecialized environment, [INAUDIBLE]\nare gonna wanna spend time on it.\n\n833\n00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.060\nBut looking at some of the standard tools\nthat are gonna be built into the operating\n\n834\n00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.993\nsystem, tools that are available to you.\n\n835\n00:40:44.993 --> 00:40:48.798\nTools that are mainline, mainstream tools,\nwould be valuable, in terms of spending\n\n836\n00:40:48.798 --> 00:40:52.357\nsome time to get familiar with, and to\nlearn more about how those tools are used.\n\n837\n00:40:52.357 --> 00:40:58.184\nNot, remember, traditionally, not as,\nperhaps, focused on tools as, maybe,\n\n838\n00:40:58.184 --> 00:41:03.366\na CEH exam would be, where we have to\nknow a lot about tools, like, EnMAP.\n\n839\n00:41:03.366 --> 00:41:05.885\nAnd some of the tools that we\nwould use on the hacking side.\n\n840\n00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:07.412\nWe have to know the switches and\n\n841\n00:41:07.412 --> 00:41:10.310\nunderstand how to work with\nthem in an exam like that.\n\n842\n00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.850\nThere's certainly may be questions about\nsome of the tools in a CHFI exam but\n\n843\n00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.580\nit's also going to be a lot about\nthe methodology and about the thought\n\n844\n00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.770\nprocess these are associated with,\nhow to execute a search and what to do.\n\n845\n00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.000\nCreating a drive image is good\nto understand how to do but\n\n846\n00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.332\nare you going to be ask how to\ndo it on five different tools?\n\n847\n00:41:25.332 --> 00:41:29.480\nWell of course not, we wouldn't really\nbe able to do that in a meaningful way.\n\n848\n00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.980\nBut is it important to know how\nto create a drive image, perhaps.\n\n849\n00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.630\nGenerically and then understand\nhow to mount that image and\n\n850\n00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.960\nhow to work with it,\nyeah that wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n851\n00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.610\nWould it be a good idea to have\na sense of how to do that?\n\n852\n00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.390\nYeah, It'd probably be a good\nidea to know how to do that.\n\n853\n00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.700\nSo, those kind of things are going\nto be valuable and helpful.\n\n854\n00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.840\nAnd just keep in mind that, in general,\nit's about the methodology and\n\n855\n00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.520\nthe process.\n\n856\n00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.370\nIt's not as much about the tools.\n\n857\n00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.910\nBecause everybody has to choose the tools\nthat are gonna make the most sense for\n\n858\n00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.030\nthem and you may not wanna work\nwith DD for instance right?\n\n859\n00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.820\nHypothetically in Linux create\na drive image but you may and\n\n860\n00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.890\nit just really depends on\nwhat you choose to do.\n\n861\n00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.590\nSo would I spend time maybe reading the\nhelp file on DD a little bit understand\n\n862\n00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.270\nthe general concept of how it works and\nmaybe just have a sense of the switches?\n\n863\n00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.020\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea but\nam I gonna use the tool everyday?\n\n864\n00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.760\nProbably not use it everyday,\nreally just depends on what you do.\n\n865\n00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.140\nSo it's up to you to decide how to\nproceed is what I'm suggesting.\n\n866\n00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.310\nBut ultimately, it's a good idea\nto see how some of the tools work,\n\n867\n00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:25.520\nsee the kind of information we can draw\nback, see that we can find deleted files,\n\n868\n00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.570\nwe can look at partitions,\nwe can examine data that's there.\n\n869\n00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.600\nThese are the skills that the CHFI, both\nin the Linux, the Mac, and certainly in\n\n870\n00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.110\nthe Windows world, but it's important\nto have a sense of how they work.\n\n871\n00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam you actually make a really\ngood point when you talk about that we're\n\n872\n00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.562\nreally focusing in on\nthe methodologies here.\n\n873\n00:42:39.562 --> 00:42:43.978\nBut it's really cool that we can use\nthe tools to drive the context home of how\n\n874\n00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:48.535\nthat methodology works itself out\npractically cuz that's ultimately what we\n\n875\n00:42:48.535 --> 00:42:49.240\nwant to do.\n\n876\n00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.700\nWe wanna be able to, for\nyou to take this knowledge and\n\n877\n00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.750\nnot just go, I know theoretically\nhow that you can recover a drive.\n\n878\n00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.586\nOr that you can take a drive image, not\nonly do you know that that's theoretically\n\n879\n00:42:59.586 --> 00:43:03.329\npossible, but you can do it and that will\nwork out for you in the future as a CHFI.\n\n880\n00:43:03.329 --> 00:43:06.260\nSo really cool job at\ndemonstrating that for us.\n\n881\n00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.940\nWe appreciate Adam showing up.\n\n882\n00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.000\nAnd, ha ha, actually putting that\non the screen for us to look at and\n\n883\n00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.450\ngo, that's how that's done.\n\n884\n00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.183\nIt's really helpful for\nus that are trying to learn that thing.\n\n885\n00:43:16.183 --> 00:43:19.703\nAdam, thanks for joining us today,\nbut I'm looking at our clock and\n\n886\n00:43:19.703 --> 00:43:22.470\nI know we've gone through\na lot of material.\n\n887\n00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.560\nAnd we're gonna take ourselves a little\nbreak here and go on to other things.\n\n888\n00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.290\nBut you go, you grab some tools,\ndownload them, install them,\n\n889\n00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.600\nget them running on your machine.\n\n890\n00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.780\nTake an image, try to recover files,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n891\n00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.331\nGive you that working knowledge of those\ntypes of tools and those procedures.\n\n892\n00:43:36.331 --> 00:43:37.933\n&gt;&gt; And Document of Doom, Document of Doom.\n\n893\n00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:40.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nmake the Document of Doom and recover it.\n\n894\n00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.180\nThat being said, we're gonna sign off.\n\n895\n00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.610\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n896\n00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.379\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n897\n00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:53.394\n[MUSIC]\n\n898\n00:43:53.394 --> 00:43:55.581\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.423\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.014\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:13.797\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n6\n00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:18.037\nand welcome to another great episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:21.002\nin today's episode, well,\nof course it's more CHFI.\n\n8\n00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.551\nAnd since that's what you've come to see,\nwe brought back The Master Blaster\n\n9\n00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:27.400\nhimself, Mr. Adam Gordon,\nto walk us down that road.\n\n10\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.350\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Master Blaster,\nthat is Mad Max under the Thunder Dome.\n\n12\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.760\n&gt;&gt; You run Bordertown, don't you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.416\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pigs are the way to go.\n\n14\n00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:37.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Natural food source.\n\n15\n00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:38.810\n&gt;&gt; Natural gas, that's right.\n\n16\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.590\nSo we could just do this all day, and\n\n17\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.160\ntalk about random one liners out\nof movies as you've heard us do.\n\n18\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.390\nBut we're gonna actually talk\nabout something important and\n\n19\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.010\nvaluable, as opposed to\nrandom movie trivia.\n\n20\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.520\nAlthough it would be interesting if you\nand I actually just as a social event,\n\n21\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.443\noutside of work, did one of those\ntrivia things like at the bar.\n\n22\n00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:57.491\nYou're sitting you got\nthe trivia movie things-\n\n23\n00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.917\n&gt;&gt; I think with our powers combined we\n\n24\n00:00:58.917 --> 00:00:59.750\nwould kill it.\n\n25\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.200\n&gt;&gt; We would be unstoppable as they say.\n\n26\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.110\nSo, anyway were not here\nto talk about that.\n\n27\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.490\nHowever, we are gonna do something really\ninteresting for you, in chatting with\n\n28\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.110\nDaniel, as were talking about, what we\nshould do to really kinda bring together,\n\n29\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.807\nsome of the themes we talk about,\nin Windows forensics, in hard drive and\n\n30\n00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.656\nfiles system forensics, in data recovery,\nand duplication of data.\n\n31\n00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.590\nYeah, we've talked about\nsome different options and\n\n32\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.270\nI thought wouldn't it be great if we took\nsome that's stuff regarding look at.\n\n33\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.810\nSome of the tools and the mechanisms and\n\n34\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.600\nmethodologies, took them in the command\nline, showed you what a common set of\n\n35\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.020\ncommand line tools are that are ported\nto Windows that are actually used\n\n36\n00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.480\nbehind the scenes in many of\nthe commercial forensics products.\n\n37\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.820\nBut that you may not really\nrealize that you're using and\n\n38\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.470\nkinda peek under the hood there a little\nbit, and show you what they are.\n\n39\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.620\nMount a simple image and actually show\nyou a couple quick things with it, and so\n\n40\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.770\nto do all of that,\nwe decided we would do this.\n\n41\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.500\nAnd so, we're gonna take a look at open\nsource digital forensics from a slightly\n\n42\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500\ndifferent perspective.\n\n43\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.450\nThe Sleuth Kit, which is actually\na really neat set of tools.\n\n44\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.920\nThey've also got a really awesome\nmascot as you could see there.\n\n45\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.700\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n46\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.825\nA little Diggety Dog there, right?\n\n47\n00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:08.815\nDo you remember Droopy?\n\n48\n00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:09.315\nThe dog, Droopy?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n49\n00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:10.290\nOf course, yes.\n\n50\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he looks kind of like that except\nhe doesn't have the sheriff's hat and\n\n51\n00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:15.100\nthe star and the gun.\n\n52\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.208\nBut what we have is a set of open\nsource digital forensics tool kits.\n\n53\n00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:22.330\nSo the sleuthkit.org is gonna be what\nyou want to take a look at here.\n\n54\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.386\nLet's just zoom in for\na second so you can see this.\n\n55\n00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:28.050\nThere were two actual sets of tools\nthat make up this thought process.\n\n56\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.732\nAutopsy and the sleuth kit.\n\n57\n00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.740\nWe're gonna focus in on the sleuth kit for\na demo here.\n\n58\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.975\nBut let's just quickly take a look\nat what you get with these.\n\n59\n00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:37.790\nCould we go full screen, cuz you can\nonly see half of what's up there.\n\n60\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n61\n00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.885\n&gt;&gt; But you can see Autopsy.\n\n62\n00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:41.855\nGUI based program allows us to officially\n\n63\n00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:44.840\nanalyze hard drives and smartphones,\nwe've done some of that already.\n\n64\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.290\nThe interesting thing here, plug in the\nmodular architecture, lets you develop and\n\n65\n00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.490\nadd modules and job or Python.\n\n66\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.120\nIf you take a look at the website,\n\n67\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.240\nthere's actually continuing open\nsource development on this.\n\n68\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.650\nThey've got a credit card analysis\nmodule that's really cool, looking for\n\n69\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.860\ncredit card numbers buried in systems for\nPCIDSS compliance and stuff like that...\n\n70\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.491\nSo it's a really neat set of tools.\n\n71\n00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:12.026\nThey've got the kind of nasty\nDoberman Pinscher there, right,\n\n72\n00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.660\nwith the little spyglass looking at you,\na magnifier glass.\n\n73\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.850\nSo that's kind of a cool thing.\n\n74\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.890\nAnd then we've got The Sleuth Kit\nright over here, and\n\n75\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.250\nthis is the one we're gonna drill down and\ndemo on in a minute.\n\n76\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.340\nBut command line tools,\n\n77\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.890\nI'm gonna show you what the tools\nare in the library that make it up.\n\n78\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.240\nIt's a C library, set of tools allows\nus to do disc image and analysis and\n\n79\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.150\nrecovery.\n\n80\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.850\nIt's used, as I said, not only in Autopsy,\nbut in many forensic tools and tool sets.\n\n81\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.140\nSo this is actually a set of tools\nthat you tend to use quite a bit,\n\n82\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.510\neven though you don't realize it.\n\n83\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.645\nThe Sleuth Kit up here,\nwe can go in, we can roll down on.\n\n84\n00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:49.055\nAs you can see, we can look at File\nSystems, Frameworks, Download, Documents,\n\n85\n00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:49.941\nHistory, etc.\n\n86\n00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.160\nSo it's actually a neat set of tools.\n\n87\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.763\nWhat we're gonna do is go in and take\na look on how this works.So if we can do\n\n88\n00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:59.386\nthe following, let me just come in here.\n\n89\n00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo when you download this,\nand you set it up,\n\n90\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.907\nyou could see there I've just\nset up the directory called tsk.\n\n91\n00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:11.050\nI've dug into tsk,\nlet me just drill out here for a second.\n\n92\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.460\nAnd when you explode this out and install\nit, you'll see we have, we have bin,\n\n93\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.670\nwe have lb, we have licenses, etc.\n\n94\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.120\nAnd so, as we drill in and\n\n95\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570\njust go into bin, we've got a set\nof tools that are listed here.\n\n96\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.270\nThere's quite a number of them.\n\n97\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.170\nAnd as you scroll down you'll see a bunch.\n\n98\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.810\nI threw an image into the root\ndirectory there, ITProTV image.\n\n99\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.660\nWe're gonna Gonna use a DB image that\nwe've created just to go ahead and\n\n100\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.470\nactually demo some quick things for you.\n\n101\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.380\nBut we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nuse the fstat tool, and we're gonna take\n\n102\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.890\na look at the file system statistics, and\ndo some of the other stuff that's in here.\n\n103\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.570\nfstat is gonna be sitting right up\nthere towards the top of the list, so\n\n104\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.910\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n105\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.350\nAnd we'll take a look at a couple\nof other tools, img_stat and\n\n106\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.020\nsome others are in there as well\nthat may be of interest to us.\n\n107\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.788\nSo you could play around with these\ntools and obviously, interact with them.\n\n108\n00:04:56.788 --> 00:04:59.496\nWe got them loaded up in a command line.\n\n109\n00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:00.282\nCould we get a full screen?\n\n110\n00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:02.580\nIt's just gonna be easier to see\nthis if we do that, I think.\n\n111\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.410\nSo with full screen, it'd just be easier.\n\n112\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.960\nI could just drop this down,\nkinda level it on the screen for\n\n113\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.510\nyou, make it real easy to see.\n\n114\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.730\nSo from within the bin,\nwe're gonna load up the image,\n\n115\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.440\nand we're gonna use the fsstat tool first.\n\n116\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.160\nThis is gonna allow us to go in and\n\n117\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.410\nview the file system details\nin the image we've created.\n\n118\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.880\nWe've got fsstat -f for\nfilesystem, ntfs filesystem type.\n\n119\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.590\nPath to the image, I've made it simple,\n\n120\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.750\nI put it in the image test directory\nthat we're gonna work with.\n\n121\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.924\nSo we've got it right there, ITProTV.dd.\n\n122\n00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:36.579\nSo we're gonna load that up,\nand we're gonna hit enter, and\n\n123\n00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.685\nwhen that happens,\njust gonna scroll back up here.\n\n124\n00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:41.360\nAnd we'll take a look at what we got.\n\n125\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.390\nSo we'll see here,\nwe've got a file system, NTFS type.\n\n126\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.830\nWe've got a Metadata information\nthat gives us the cluster, so\n\n127\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.250\nit tells us what the information for\nthe images.\n\n128\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.190\nIn other words, what the status of the\nimage on the hard drive would have been.\n\n129\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.740\nSo what the MFT, the information\nis gonna look like in it, where to\n\n130\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.095\ndrill in the MFT, the file master table,\nin a little bit, and take a look in there.\n\n131\n00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:09.890\nBut we've got a range, we've got\nthe information on the sector size.\n\n132\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.082\nSo the number of bytes per second, we've\ntalked about this, tells us it's 512.\n\n133\n00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:18.150\nWe've got the cluster size its 4096 bytes,\nso a 4k cluster.\n\n134\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.192\nSo NTFS we could tell a lot about that,\nand know what's going on there,\n\n135\n00:06:21.192 --> 00:06:24.551\ngood thing we did that whole conversation\non our hard drives and file systems.\n\n136\n00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.640\n&gt;&gt; Kind of makes sense now.\n\n137\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.370\n&gt;&gt; Boy would you not understand\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n138\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.880\nBy the way, if you're looking at this and\nyou don't know what I'm talking about,\n\n139\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.800\nit's because you haven't viewed the hard\ndrive and file system episodes that we\n\n140\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.680\nput together, where we actually\nexplain what all these items are.\n\n141\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.050\nWhat the sector size is,\nwhat the cluster size is.\n\n142\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.820\nWhat the cluster range is,\nhow a hard drive it structured.\n\n143\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.310\nWhat all this information is.\n\n144\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.630\nGo back and view those episodes before you\ncome back and take a look at this one.\n\n145\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.300\nThis is gonna make a lot\nmore sense to you.\n\n146\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.190\nBut we actually explained all this\nalready, we're just not gonna go back and\n\n147\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.720\ndo it again.\n\n148\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.580\nWe're gonna encourage you to go back and\ntake a look and\n\n149\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.970\nsee what was going on there.\n\n150\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.070\nAll right, so back to where we are,\nso we've got all that, so\n\n151\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.529\nwe're just gonna scroll\ndown here a little bit.\n\n152\n00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.394\nYou could see that we've\ngot information in here.\n\n153\n00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:06.346\nWe've got attribute definition or\n\n154\n00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:09.410\nattribute values rather\ndefining the attribute file.\n\n155\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.629\nBut we've got just a bunch of information\nabout the structure of the hard drive, and\n\n156\n00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.651\ninformation that will be of value to us,\n\n157\n00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.111\nthat we would then wanna\nbe able to take a look at.\n\n158\n00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.681\nSo the most important on the top,\nit's definitely NTFS gives us the sectors,\n\n159\n00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:25.327\ngives us the byte count or\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n160\n00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:26.824\nSo we've got that so far.\n\n161\n00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:29.496\nSo initially, let me just scroll\ndown a little bit here, just so\n\n162\n00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:33.150\nwe can kinda have all that, but we'll put\nthat right up back towards the top there.\n\n163\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.730\nSo we've got that, we've been through,\nwe've taken a look, listen to me.\n\n164\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.820\nWe've taken a look at\nthe file system structure.\n\n165\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.470\nWhat we wanna do now, is we wanna\ngo in and wanna use the istat tool.\n\n166\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.370\nThis is gonna give us\naccess to the metadata.\n\n167\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.130\nSo it's the next thing\nwe're gonna take a look at.\n\n168\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.880\nSo let's just go in here.\n\n169\n00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.190\nJust scroll through my Command,\nthere we go.\n\n170\n00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.480\nJust got them already loaded up.\n\n171\n00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.951\nSo istat is gonna give us\naccess to the metadata.\n\n172\n00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.444\nNow again, same kind of thought process,\nistat, the name of the tool, f for\n\n173\n00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:02.971\nfile system, type NTFS,\nload the image We'll do that and,\n\n174\n00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:05.620\noops, what did I, I know what I forgot.\n\n175\n00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.701\nI keep doing the same thing over and\nover and over again.\n\n176\n00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:12.277\nAnd let me do that and do that.\n\n177\n00:08:12.277 --> 00:08:14.514\nI keep forgetting to put zero\non the end of that thing,\n\n178\n00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:16.901\nto take a look at the structure\nof the master file table and\n\n179\n00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.717\nsee what's there as we\nstart to look at it.\n\n180\n00:08:18.717 --> 00:08:20.100\nI always forget to do that.\n\n181\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.630\nWhen I use this tool, so\nlet me just scroll down here.\n\n182\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.500\nAnd there we go, just pull that up\njust a little bit so you could see it.\n\n183\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.740\nSo when we use zero which is gonna\ntell us what structure of the MFT,\n\n184\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.800\nthe master file table is,\nwe can go and we can take a look.\n\n185\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.185\nWe could see in In here.\n\n186\n00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:37.473\nThat we have some basic information,\nwhen this was created,\n\n187\n00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:39.885\nwhen it was accessed,\nwhen it was modified.\n\n188\n00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.135\nSo we've got some date and\ntime stamps there.\n\n189\n00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:44.475\nWe've got some file name and attributes so\n\n190\n00:08:44.475 --> 00:08:47.207\nwe've gotten hidden in system\nfile information there.\n\n191\n00:08:47.207 --> 00:08:51.227\nSo we've got some basic information about\nthe allocation size of the hard drive,\n\n192\n00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:53.697\nwhat the image is gonna tell us,\nand what it looks like.\n\n193\n00:08:53.697 --> 00:08:57.167\nAnd we've just got a bunch of\ninformation that allows us\n\n194\n00:08:57.167 --> 00:09:01.337\nto begin to understand the structure\nof the data that is in the file table.\n\n195\n00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.067\nWe can view details in\nthe metadata structure, and\n\n196\n00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:05.916\nas we start to go in and take a look.\n\n197\n00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:09.712\nIt's gonna be helpful because the master\nfile table has a reference for\n\n198\n00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:12.826\nevery file that is listed and\navailable in the hard drive.\n\n199\n00:09:12.826 --> 00:09:16.970\nBut we have to do is we have to drill\ndown in order to be able to see it.\n\n200\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.372\nAnd so what we're gonna do is start to\nread the master file table by going in and\n\n201\n00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:24.366\nstarting to change the number\nat the end of the list.\n\n202\n00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:28.987\nAnd just start to reference information\nthat's there as we drill down and\n\n203\n00:09:28.987 --> 00:09:33.692\nwe take a look one item at a time or\nkinda start drilling in and taking a look.\n\n204\n00:09:33.692 --> 00:09:36.299\nWhat we're gonna see\nis we're gonna find or\n\n205\n00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.614\ntake a look at as we start to\nread to the various numbers.\n\n206\n00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:42.477\nThat we have a backup copy of\nthe MFT cuz we always see that and\n\n207\n00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:44.717\nwe always want to know\nthere's a backup copy.\n\n208\n00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:47.698\nIf you remember, we took a look at the\nfile structure in the other episodes that\n\n209\n00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:48.800\nwe were talking about.\n\n210\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.970\nWe have the MFT and\nwe have the mirror MFT.\n\n211\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.795\nThe recovery for the MFT, and so\nthe backup copy is the mirror.\n\n212\n00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.815\nAnd we can see MFT mirror is sitting,\n\n213\n00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:59.215\nlet's see if I can highlight it,\nis sitting right there.\n\n214\n00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:03.577\nWe're just checking to make sure\nthat we can see that it is there.\n\n215\n00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:05.365\nWait, let me see if I can zoom in.\n\n216\n00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:07.385\nI can't highlight and\nzoom in at the same time.\n\n217\n00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:11.885\nBut you can see sitting right there,\nunder $FILE_NAME Attribute, $MFTMirr.\n\n218\n00:10:11.885 --> 00:10:14.960\nWe can see we have an attribute that\nshows us that there is a backup.\n\n219\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.426\nCopy of it, so we're checking and\nkind of walking through the metadata\n\n220\n00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:22.263\nlogically to ensure that we could see\nthe structure and we know what's there.\n\n221\n00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:25.953\nWant to make sure we have that backup,\ncuz remember, if something was deleted,\n\n222\n00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:28.904\nwe may have to look in the backup\ncopy in the MFT mirror to find it.\n\n223\n00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:32.030\nJust want to make sure that that file\nis resident and that we can see it.\n\n224\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.850\nSo we're gonna take a look there and\nsee that.\n\n225\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.840\nLet's go in, let me just get rid of that.\n\n226\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.055\nLet's go in,\nlet's put number 7 up here and\n\n227\n00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.365\nlet's take a look at\nsome other information.\n\n228\n00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:46.637\nWhat we're going to be able to find here\nis the boot sector of the file system by\n\n229\n00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:51.109\nusing number seven and at the end of that\nline, kind of reading through different\n\n230\n00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.778\ninformation and looking for\ndifferent stuff.\n\n231\n00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:58.810\nWe've got boot, right here and\nthis is the actual boot file entry.\n\n232\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.660\nAnd I'm gonna highlight this and let's see\nif we can do a zoom in at the same time.\n\n233\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.613\nThere we go.\nI did it the last time the wrong way,\n\n234\n00:11:05.613 --> 00:11:06.798\nI wasn't able to grab it.\n\n235\n00:11:06.798 --> 00:11:10.493\nAnd what we do here you could see is that\nwe are actually able to see the boot\n\n236\n00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:14.692\npartition and we're actually able to see\nthe allocated size and the actual size.\n\n237\n00:11:14.692 --> 00:11:17.802\nThey are the same but we can see\ninformation about the boot entries and\n\n238\n00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:18.710\nthe boot table.\n\n239\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.060\nWe can see what they are,\nhow big it is and information about it.\n\n240\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.430\nAgain, we're examining the hard drive,\n\n241\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.610\nkind of walking through the metadata\nlisted in the MFT, looking at different\n\n242\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.480\nentries, trying to find information\nabout it and understand what it is.\n\n243\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.300\nAnd by walking through using these\ndifferent numbers at the end of the line,\n\n244\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.740\nwe can read different kinds\nof information on the file.\n\n245\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.270\nLet's take a look at another one, so\nwe'll just tee this up here real quick.\n\n246\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.530\nLet's go in there.\n\n247\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.170\nAnd let us do the following.\n\n248\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.530\nI think we're gonna look at,\nlet's see, let's look at, whoops,\n\n249\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.670\ndidn't mean to do that.\n\n250\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.130\nLet's go in and let's take a look at\nnumber three which will give us volume\n\n251\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.310\ninformation, volume label,\nthings like that.\n\n252\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.660\nYou could do that one.\n\n253\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.483\nLet me think about number,\nwe see maybe number four,\n\n254\n00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:03.500\nouch, I got a little knot there.\n\n255\n00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.210\nNumber four.\n\n256\n00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.720\nWe can go in and do number four, I'll demo\nboth of these for you in just a second.\n\n257\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.070\nBut let's do number four,\nwe'll take a look and\n\n258\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.140\nwe can see with number four that we're\nlooking at attribute definitions.\n\n259\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.932\nWe're looking to see with the item number\nfour at the end of the list there If we\n\n260\n00:12:19.932 --> 00:12:24.306\nhave any attributes that are defined,\nwith regards to the metadata.\n\n261\n00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:27.670\nAnd if we see that, we'll be able\nto see namespace identifiers and\n\n262\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.002\ninformation about them.\n\n263\n00:12:29.002 --> 00:12:31.270\nAnd we could see that we\ngot some information there.\n\n264\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.740\nWhat we're doing, remember, is walking\nthrough all the different hidden file\n\n265\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.470\ntypes, or all the different file types\nin the MFT that are referenced, and\n\n266\n00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.960\nlooking at each file and\nparsing it to see what they are.\n\n267\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.022\nRemember as we take a look,\nthese are all hidden system files, right.\n\n268\n00:12:46.022 --> 00:12:50.437\nAnd so they're in the partition but we're\nnot able to see them normally unless we're\n\n269\n00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:53.624\nusing a disk editor like this that\nactually lets us drill in and\n\n270\n00:12:53.624 --> 00:12:55.270\nsee this information.\n\n271\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.375\nSo it's giving us very\nvaluable Information, but\n\n272\n00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:58.665\nthis is normally hidden from us.\n\n273\n00:12:58.665 --> 00:13:01.635\nWhen we look at the partition we don't see\nall of this because every one of these\n\n274\n00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:03.685\nfiles is marked as a hidden file.\n\n275\n00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.305\nThe dollar sign in front, remember,\n\n276\n00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:07.575\nindicates something hidden\nin the Windows file system.\n\n277\n00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:11.310\nAnd so we're not gonna necessarily be able\nto read all that, but it is information\n\n278\n00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.248\nthat's gonna be very valuable for\nus to be able to take a look at.\n\n279\n00:13:14.248 --> 00:13:16.275\nLet's do the bitmap overview.\n\n280\n00:13:16.275 --> 00:13:17.835\nSo let's do number six here.\n\n281\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.070\nWe'll take a look at this.\n\n282\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.510\nWe can do the bitmap.\n\n283\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.010\nThe bitmap overview gives us just\ninformation about the bitmap.\n\n284\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.580\nThere's all these different ones we\ncan drill down and take a look at.\n\n285\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.370\nUltimately, as we walk through and\nwe just see all the different kind,\n\n286\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.180\nwhoops, different kind of\ninformation that's there.\n\n287\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.040\nIf we do number 9, we'll be able to\ntake a look at some of the data.\n\n288\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.430\nThat is resident there,\nlet me just bring this up.\n\n289\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.823\nLet me see if we can get, all right.\n\n290\n00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:48.367\nThere, all right?\n\n291\n00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:51.910\nAnd so we're looking at\ninformation in another way.\n\n292\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.390\nWe're now starting to look at and\ndrill down at some of the information or\n\n293\n00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.980\nlook at the what is this,\nnumber nine, back clusters.\n\n294\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.220\nBack clusters is number eight but\nrather with number nine,\n\n295\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.610\nwe're taking a look at access control\npolicies for files in the directory,\n\n296\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.200\nin the descriptors that define access\ncontrol for the files listed in the MFT.\n\n297\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.150\nThese are all the descriptors that\nwill actually help us to understand\n\n298\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.610\nwhat kind of file access control is being\nimplemented and we can then use these to\n\n299\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.990\nwalk through and understand permission\nstructures in the directory.\n\n300\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.753\nSo that's gonna be good for us to know.\n\n301\n00:14:23.753 --> 00:14:26.310\nl didn't put up number eight but\nI was just talking about it.\n\n302\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.330\nNumber eight is the bad cluster map and\n\n303\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.950\nif there's any bad clusters\nit'll actually tell us that.\n\n304\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.200\nAnd this one is actually really good to\ntake a look at and to understand a few.\n\n305\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.380\nRemember in one of our last episodes,\n\n306\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.680\nwe talked about the fact that when\na cluster is marked as bad or\n\n307\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.520\na sector is marked as bad, it may be more\nthan one sector, maybe a whole cluster.\n\n308\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.130\nThat a lot of times the file system marks\nit as bad and it's legitimately bad,\n\n309\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.480\nwe just can't store data there.\n\n310\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.160\nBut a lot of times I said bad actors may\npurposely go in and mark sectors and\n\n311\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.360\nclusters bad and then hide data there.\n\n312\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.330\nWe're gonna not see hey this is\nwhat Daniel marked as being good or\n\n313\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.900\nbad what we are gonna see here is whether\nthere are bad clusters in the drive.\n\n314\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.060\nIf there is or are bad clusters the map\nwill show it here because the allocated\n\n315\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.140\nsize information will show us\nthat there are bad clusters.\n\n316\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.100\nWe could then go in and use a special\nset of tools to examine them and\n\n317\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.170\nactually see whether they're truly bad or\n\n318\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.780\nwhether they can read because they're\nmark is bad, there's actually data there.\n\n319\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.228\nSo checking this particular item would\nactually help us to drill down and\n\n320\n00:15:23.228 --> 00:15:23.743\nsee that.\n\n321\n00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:26.336\nAnd we will begin to build the picture\nof the information that may or\n\n322\n00:15:26.336 --> 00:15:27.350\nmay not be there.\n\n323\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.990\nSo it's very helpful for us to know that,\nand to be aware of that.\n\n324\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.200\nAnd that's one of the things\nwe would wanna look at here.\n\n325\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.830\nSo just giving you some insight into some\nof the tools, or rather the attributes\n\n326\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.270\nof the MFT, the master file table,\nthat we can look at here.\n\n327\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.960\nIn addition to all this,\nwhat we're going to do is drill down,\n\n328\n00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.050\nand we're going to take a look\nat another command called FLS.\n\n329\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.700\nWe're going to take a look at a file\nlisting, and just see all the files that\n\n330\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.110\nare listed there, or at least\nthe directories that are available to us.\n\n331\n00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.878\nSo let's go in and just do FLS.\n\n332\n00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:57.407\nSo, we'll get rid of this, we'll go in and\nwe'll just get rid of this.\n\n333\n00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:59.721\nWe don't need all this.\n\n334\n00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:03.574\nAnd let's do, fls, do that.\n\n335\n00:16:03.574 --> 00:16:07.372\nAnd we can see that we're able to go\nahead and get a listing of all of\n\n336\n00:16:07.372 --> 00:16:11.740\nthe directories and their files that\nare listed in this particular image.\n\n337\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.107\nSo we can begin to get, you know pull\nthem up, drill down on necessary.\n\n338\n00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:19.617\nMaybe going in to songs or\nvideos files or whatever the case may be.\n\n339\n00:16:19.617 --> 00:16:22.786\nAnd we can actually go in and\nwe can take a look at all of that.\n\n340\n00:16:22.786 --> 00:16:26.215\nWe can take a look at any of the\ninformation that may be listed there and\n\n341\n00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:29.765\nwe'd be able to pull that up actually\ngo and look at individual files and\n\n342\n00:16:29.765 --> 00:16:32.785\nrecover them if necessary\nusing this tool kit as well.\n\n343\n00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:36.700\nSo we actually can go in and\nwe can examine the structure of the drive.\n\n344\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.260\nWe can examine the files\nthat are listed there.\n\n345\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.740\nWe can look for bad sectors.\n\n346\n00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.030\nWe can read the MFT,\nthe master file tabel.\n\n347\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.502\nAnd really walk through every aspect\nof it using this set of tools.\n\n348\n00:16:46.502 --> 00:16:48.616\nAnd there's so\nmuch more that we can do with this.\n\n349\n00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:51.743\nThis is really just scratching\nthe surface with a quick little show and\n\n350\n00:16:51.743 --> 00:16:54.557\ntell demonstration for\nyou on this tool and what it looks like.\n\n351\n00:16:54.557 --> 00:16:58.207\nBut it's a tool a lot of Windows forensic\nexaminers use, it's a tool that you may or\n\n352\n00:16:58.207 --> 00:17:01.334\nmay not come across unless someone\ntakes the time to point it out to you,\n\n353\n00:17:01.334 --> 00:17:03.419\nbut it's a tool that really\nhas a lot of value and\n\n354\n00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:05.600\nreally gives us\nthe capability to drill in.\n\n355\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.381\nBut you have to be comfortable\nwith the command line right?\n\n356\n00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:09.840\nAnd you have to be comfortable\nworking In the command line.\n\n357\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.690\nNow keep in mind, as I said,\nif you're not familiar with the tool\n\n358\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.960\nfsstat and as we've talked about before,\n\n359\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.740\nright, you take a look and there may\nbe a help file, there may not be.\n\n360\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.150\nWhen you do fsstat,\nit says hey by the way, error,\n\n361\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.490\nyou gotta put an image file in there.\n\n362\n00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.400\nThere's not a lot of documentation.\n\n363\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.997\nRight, for this particular tool.\n\n364\n00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.110\nIn other words,\nthere's no built in help file for this.\n\n365\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.300\nWhat you'd have to do is go back,\nRight out here.\n\n366\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.681\nYou'd have to go into the sleuth kit.\n\n367\n00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.440\nSo we'd have to go drill down here.\n\n368\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.580\nYou'd have to go in and take a look\nat some of the information here\n\n369\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.980\nunder documents and you'd have to actually\ngo in and read the documents off of\n\n370\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.180\nthe actual website to learn\na little bit more about it.\n\n371\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.058\nThere's Help Documents right there.\n\n372\n00:17:53.058 --> 00:17:56.996\nAnd so, you'd wanna obviously do a little\ndue diligence, do a little research.\n\n373\n00:17:56.996 --> 00:18:00.272\nThrough trial and error, you can figure\nit out on your own, or you can go and\n\n374\n00:18:00.272 --> 00:18:01.680\njust read up on how to do it.\n\n375\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.410\nBut there's actual help files\nthat you have to read and\n\n376\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.240\nlook at separately from built-in help\ndocumented around the executable.\n\n377\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.020\nAnd you just want to know that when\nyou're using a tool like this,\n\n378\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.080\ncuz unlike some of the tools,\nthis set of tools is not going to\n\n379\n00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.810\nhave all the help files\nassociated with the executables.\n\n380\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.120\nYou have to actually gonna go in and read\nthem offline or essentially read them on\n\n381\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.620\nyour own to figure out what\nthe command structures look like.\n\n382\n00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.737\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n383\n00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:26.654\nYou have a sense that.\n\n384\n00:18:26.654 --> 00:18:28.973\nAnd that you are comfortable\nwith that as we go through and\n\n385\n00:18:28.973 --> 00:18:30.240\ntake a look at a tool like this.\n\n386\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.886\nBut hopefully, it's been just\na valuable little oversight and\n\n387\n00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:37.952\noverview for you with regards to how\na tool like the Sleuth Kit can work.\n\n388\n00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:40.293\nAs I said,\nit's a tool that you often trip across or\n\n389\n00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.798\ncome across without even\nrealizing you're using it,\n\n390\n00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:46.140\nbecause it underlies a lot of\nthe forensics tools we actually are using.\n\n391\n00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.780\nBut we just don't necessarily realize\nthat's it's being used behind the scenes.\n\n392\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nYou gotta remember,\n\n393\n00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.190\nnot everything is a GUI driven tool,\nright?\n\n394\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.946\nSometimes you're gonna be right\nthere with your little fingers,\n\n395\n00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:57.160\ntapping away at a keyboard,\ngetting tools to work for\n\n396\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.340\nyou that way cuz you're\nmaybe in a headless system.\n\n397\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.048\nSomething to that effect, or you just want\nto stay in there because you like the way\n\n398\n00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:06.120\nthe output looks or works better for\nyou in your environment.\n\n399\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.632\nThat could very well be the case,\n\n400\n00:19:07.632 --> 00:19:10.333\nI know that I typically spend\na lot of time in a command line.\n\n401\n00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:13.736\nNot because I hate GUIs but\njust because I'm there doing other things,\n\n402\n00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.799\nmight as well have tools that work\nin that environment as well and\n\n403\n00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.060\ndo a very good job of that.\n\n404\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.374\nSo knowing about the sleuth kit\nbeing available for you and\n\n405\n00:19:21.374 --> 00:19:25.779\nmight even actually already be there\nIs something that you might wanna know.\n\n406\n00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:28.915\nAdam, is there anything else we need\nto know about the Sleuth Kit before we\n\n407\n00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:29.529\ncall it a day?\n\n408\n00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:32.187\n&gt;&gt; You just gotta make sure\nyou wear your [CROSSTALK],\n\n409\n00:19:32.187 --> 00:19:34.541\nyou have to have your\nlittle [INAUDIBLE] hat.\n\n410\n00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:37.030\nGotta have the pipe and\nyou gotta have the, you know.\n\n411\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.961\n&gt;&gt; The monocle?\n\n412\n00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:39.807\n&gt;&gt; No not the monocle, the.\n\n413\n00:19:39.807 --> 00:19:41.617\n&gt;&gt; Magnifying glass.\n&gt;&gt; Magnifying glass, right, exactly, yeah.\n\n414\n00:19:41.617 --> 00:19:44.800\nYou gotta have that and\nthen you're ready to go.\n\n415\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.730\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n416\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.873\nWell now that we have our marching orders,\nrun out there,\n\n417\n00:19:48.873 --> 00:19:51.711\nlook at The Sleuth Kit's website,\ncheck that out.\n\n418\n00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:52.536\n&gt;&gt; sleuthkit.org.\n\n419\n00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:53.422\n&gt;&gt; sleuthkit.org.\n\n420\n00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:55.197\nThat being said,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n421\n00:19:55.197 --> 00:19:57.968\nSo we do thank you guys

00:00:12.370\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.084\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:17.150\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.450\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode well, it's more on CHFI.\n\n7\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.970\nAnd joining us back again in\nthe studio is our good friend,\n\n8\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150\nour mentor, our guiding star\nas it were Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.960\nAdam welcome back and\nhow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.110\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot to live up to\nfirst thing in the morning.\n\n11\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.212\nI only had two cups of coffee for\nChrist sake.\n\n12\n00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:35.053\n&gt;&gt; Like about high.\n\n13\n00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:36.628\n&gt;&gt; That's very high.\n\n14\n00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:38.710\nIt is good and I am well.\n\n15\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.200\nAnd although I may not live up to\neverything Daniel indicated I would be,\n\n16\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.080\nI am certainly going to try.\n\n17\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.450\nSo, we're here as we continue\nour conversations about\n\n18\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.330\nthings related to digital forensics and\nCHFI-like information.\n\n19\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.920\nDaniel and\nI were chatting before we got started.\n\n20\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.900\nWe thought, wouldn't it be great right.\n\n21\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.160\nIf we could take some tools,\nmaybe access data FTK for\n\n22\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.600\ninstance and\nshow you how they actually work.\n\n23\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600\nIn other words,\n\n24\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.990\nwhat can we do to answer the question how\ndoes an investigator build a case file?\n\n25\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.440\nAnd how do they actually present\ninformation using one or\n\n26\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.160\nmore of the commonly associated tools\nthat we use in the field of forensics.\n\n27\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.170\nAnd so In order to do that, we have\nactually gone to the end of the earth and\n\n28\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.960\nbrought back for you the following demo.\n\n29\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.001\nDaniel if you please.\n\n30\n00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.297\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthe demo it's going to be right there.\n\n31\n00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:34.344\n&gt;&gt; All right so what we're gonna do is\nwalk you through what I'm gonna do Daniel\n\n33\n00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.320\nis gonna help as he always does.\n\n34\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.770\nWe're gonna walk you through what using\na common case management tool like\n\n35\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810\naccess data FTK look's like,\nwe already got a little case file set up,\n\n36\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240\ngot a bunch of stuff in there.\n\n37\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.310\nGonna walk you through some of the bells\nand whistles, features of the tool.\n\n38\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.150\nLook at some of the areas that\nmay be of interest to us.\n\n39\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.980\nWe'll show you how to set up a case,\nwe'll show you how to add some evidence.\n\n40\n00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.115\nTake a look at the help file where,\nas Daniel called it,\n\n41\n00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:02.128\nthe glorified help file/manual.\n\n42\n00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:04.972\nAnd I believe that's what you called it\nwhen I was explaining what I wanted to\n\n43\n00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:06.020\nshow everybody.\n\n44\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.730\nAnd we'll point out some of the key\nthings that if you're preparing for\n\n45\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.930\nthe CHFI exam you'll probably\nwant to have some knowledge of.\n\n46\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.830\nWe're also gonna take you out on the web\nand show you where the website for\n\n47\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.060\nthis product is and encourage you to take\na look at the more recent version of it,\n\n48\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.580\nthere's some cool new features in there.\n\n49\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.000\nAnd as always, depending on when you're\nwatching this, we put this together at\n\n50\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.530\na certain point in time, you may not\nsee it for several months afterwards.\n\n51\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.560\nThere could be a newer newer version\nby the time you take a look.\n\n52\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.301\nI wanna encourage you to go out and,\nobviously,\n\n53\n00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.222\njust keep up to date on what's\ngoing on with the tool.\n\n54\n00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.278\nThe interesting thing about tools like\nthis is that years ago you used to be able\n\n55\n00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:43.455\nto get a demo,\nmuch like the one I'm gonna show you.\n\n56\n00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.505\nEssentially a fully featured product.\n\n57\n00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:50.155\nThis one is limited to only finding\n5,000 items to add to the case file.\n\n58\n00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:50.845\nBut in general,\n\n59\n00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:54.515\nessentially works the same way the full\nproduct would, with that limitation.\n\n60\n00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:58.725\nBut more often than not, these days,\nvendors are not giving out product demos.\n\n61\n00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:02.400\nInstead, as I was discussing with\nDaniel before we got started.\n\n62\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.178\nWhat's really happening these days is\nthey're encouraging you to go to their\n\n63\n00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:06.700\nwebsite.\n\n64\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.712\nAnd to either look at videos that perhaps\nthey've shot or someone's put together,\n\n65\n00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:14.260\nprofessionally done, kinda\nhighlighting the features of the tool.\n\n66\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.780\nBecause the tool gets updated so\nfrequently and\n\n67\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.330\nmore often than not today\nthese tools are cloud enabled.\n\n68\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.400\nSo a lot of the things and features that\nthese tools have also a component of them\n\n69\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.400\nwill typically involve being able to link\nto the cloud, doing endpoint discovery,\n\n70\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.550\nthings of that nature through the cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.086\nAnd as a result you can't really\ndemo that, even if you set it up.\n\n72\n00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:37.621\nThe reality is you need some of\nthe backend vender infrastructure to\n\n73\n00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:39.330\nbe able to manage that.\n\n74\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.470\nAnd so what they're doing more and more\nis pushing you towards interacting with\n\n75\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.890\nthe demos that are prerecorded or\nthat they've put together.\n\n76\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.257\nSome of them have YouTube channels that\nthey put out, which is kinda interesting.\n\n77\n00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:53.938\nSo it's just a slightly\ndifferent way of dealing with\n\n78\n00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:56.797\nthis than it would've been\nback in the day, so to speak,\n\n79\n00:03:56.797 --> 00:04:00.867\nright, when these products were first\nreally starting to emerge on the market.\n\n80\n00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:04.354\nAnd you actually would download a feature\nversion product, you would install,\n\n81\n00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:07.240\nmuch like we've done here, and\nyou would then go ahead and use it.\n\n82\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.590\nSo just want you to understand\nthat when you go to look for\n\n83\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.855\nthis kind of a tool, you're not gonna\nfind on the access data website\n\n84\n00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:15.775\ndemo like the one I'm gonna\nshow you of this tool.\n\n85\n00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:19.685\nIt's a slightly older version of the tool\nand we're gonna use it to demo but\n\n86\n00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:23.445\nwhen you wanna watch and interact with it\nyou're gonna look at the material online.\n\n87\n00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:26.073\nSo I want you to be prepared for\nthat, have a sense of that,\n\n88\n00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:28.112\nunderstand that,\nnot get caught off guard so\n\n89\n00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:31.994\nto speak when you say, hey, why can't I go\nfind that software Adam was playing with?\n\n90\n00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:34.395\nAnd why can't I kind of work with it?\n\n91\n00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.725\nWe just want you to have a sense\nof that and be aware of that.\n\n92\n00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:37.755\nIt's also cuz I'm special.\n\n93\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.854\nJust the way things are.\n\n94\n00:04:39.854 --> 00:04:41.126\n&gt;&gt; You're special all right, [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what people say.\n\n96\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.480\nExactly that way, by the way.\n\n97\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.160\nSame exact sneer and derision of me\nin their voice when they say that.\n\n98\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.583\nAll right, so let's do the following.\n\n99\n00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.270\nI'm gonna zoom in and just show you\nthe interface here a little bit.\n\n100\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.340\nSo you can see, that let me just\nmove over there, there we go.\n\n101\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.340\nYou can see that we've\ngot the file menu there.\n\n102\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.578\nWe've got the ability to\ngo through some tabs.\n\n103\n00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:06.240\nWe'll start taking a look at some of this.\n\n104\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.190\nBut I've built out an evidence\nfile already, a case file.\n\n105\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.065\nWe've added in 5,000 items.\n\n106\n00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:14.230\nSo you can see under file\nitems there total file items.\n\n107\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.400\nWe've got evidence items, things that\nwe've added in whether they're hard\n\n108\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.560\ndrive images, folders Items that provide\ninformation are called evidence items.\n\n109\n00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.360\nGot six of those overall.\n\n110\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.730\nWe've got a bunch of items\nthat are listed there.\n\n111\n00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.010\nYou could see, by category, I've got,\n\n112\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.420\nit looks like no encrypted files\nright now, nothing from email.\n\n113\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.900\nI don't have anything from\nthe releted- the releted.\n\n114\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.140\nThat's the deleted Recycle Bin,\nthe new feature combined together,\n\n115\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.950\nit's called the releted file.\n\n116\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.160\nI have nothing from the Recycle Bin or\ndeleted files there.\n\n117\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.140\nI do have, as you can see,\ndata carve files.\n\n118\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.440\nWe'll talk about what carving\nis down there at the bottom.\n\n119\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.070\nCarving is kind of an interesting concept.\n\n120\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.875\nWhen we think about carving, what we\nthink about is the ability to go in and\n\n121\n00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.290\nrecover file information,\ntypically images more often than not.\n\n122\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.870\nIt's a term we use with steganography.\n\n123\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.003\nIt is a concept that allows us\nto go in and recover files and\n\n124\n00:06:06.003 --> 00:06:08.800\nrecover information based on data.\n\n125\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.240\nSo we try to reconstitute the file\nwithout necessarily having all the data\n\n126\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.465\navailable to do so.\n\n127\n00:06:14.465 --> 00:06:16.776\nAnd so\nwe've got carved image capability or\n\n128\n00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:20.930\ncarved file capabilities in here got\ndocuments, got some spreadsheets.\n\n129\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.715\nGot a bunch of graphics files on\nthe right hand side under file category,\n\n130\n00:06:25.715 --> 00:06:28.003\ngot 113 executables we found.\n\n131\n00:06:28.003 --> 00:06:30.680\nGot about 3,000 folders.\n\n132\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.851\nGot some slack or free space information.\n\n133\n00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:37.010\nGot a bunch of different stuff and\nalso some stuff that's uncategorized.\n\n134\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.210\nGot almost a thousand unknown typed items.\n\n135\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.010\nThings that we may not understand or\nbe aware of until we start investigating.\n\n136\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.730\nSo we got a lot of information in there.\n\n137\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.410\nWe've got, as you can see here, we just\ncome down, the evidence item's down below\n\n138\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.050\nso we can see that we've added\nin stuff from different areas.\n\n139\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.980\nI've got documents that\nare added in there.\n\n140\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.260\nI've brought in the local drive on\nthe machine I'm demoing off of.\n\n141\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.983\nSo I brought in an NTFS partition,\njust bring in some Windows stuff so\n\n142\n00:07:03.983 --> 00:07:05.982\nwe can see what that would look like.\n\n143\n00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:10.920\nBrought in a dot ARC image file that\nwe created with our drive image.\n\n144\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.920\nSo we can take a look at a drive image,\nso we got that from a FAT partition.\n\n145\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.020\nWe got a bunch of pictures.\n\n146\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.524\nI just dumped a bunch of pictures\non the desktop and brought them in.\n\n147\n00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:20.990\nAnd we've got a bunch of other stuff.\n\n148\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.899\nSo we have a whole bunch\n\n149\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.930\nof information that we've added\nin to build the case file.\n\n150\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.080\nWhat I thought we would do would be\nto start out just by showing you\n\n151\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.820\nwhat it looks like to build\na case file from scratch.\n\n152\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.690\nWe'll then come back.\n\n153\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.960\nWe can open up this one and\nthen add some evidence into it, just so\n\n154\n00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.130\nwe can see what that looks like.\n\n155\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.635\nSo if we go in here, and\nwe go file, and we go new case.\n\n156\n00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:47.459\nYou could see that I can open up and\ncreate a brand new case, open an existing\n\n157\n00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:51.300\none, add evidence to one, close a case,\nback it up, save it, export it.\n\n158\n00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.922\nWhatever, there's reports in there.\n\n159\n00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:54.560\nWe'll take a look at all that as we go.\n\n160\n00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.261\nSo let's do the following.\n\n161\n00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:58.210\nJust get out of there.\n\n162\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.105\nLet's go ahead,\nlet's create a brand new case.\n\n163\n00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:04.114\nWhen we bring this up, what we're able\nto do is just essentially go in and\n\n164\n00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:07.190\npre-populate some of\nthe fields that are there.\n\n165\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.010\nJust move that over so you can see that.\n\n166\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.260\nWe got Investigator Name.\n\n167\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.450\nI just pre-populated some of this so\nI already have the path laid out.\n\n168\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.025\nYou would obviously type\nthis in from scratch.\n\n169\n00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:19.753\nYou'd put in your name, whatever the name\nof the investigator will be, case number,\n\n170\n00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:21.045\ncase name, very important.\n\n171\n00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:24.800\nYou need a unique identifier to\nbe able to track the case file.\n\n172\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.277\nIt's got a little description there,\ngotta type that in,\n\n173\n00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:28.920\nspecify where you're gonna put this.\n\n174\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.820\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do this.\n\n175\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:38.787\nWe'll call this ITProTV 235.\n\n176\n00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:42.126\nThat will be our new identifier and\ncase number.\n\n177\n00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:43.560\nAnd so case number there.\n\n178\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.154\nCase name,\nwe'll call this Daniel's machine, right?\n\n179\n00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:53.140\nSo that we know, in theory,\nwho the name or what the name is that\n\n180\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.907\nwe wanna use to track this, along with\nwhat the unique identifier will be.\n\n181\n00:08:57.907 --> 00:09:03.828\nIn Case Description,\nForensic exam of Daniel L's\n\n182\n00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:08.930\nmachine, or something like that, right?\n\n183\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.300\nSo we have a little bit of case notes\ngoing on there just to start us out.\n\n184\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.880\nWe understand what that is,\nand where that came from.\n\n185\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.990\nSo we'll do that.\n\n186\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.754\nGot some information.\n\n187\n00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:23.016\nAgain, here we would put in, what's\nthe agency or company, examiner's name,\n\n188\n00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:27.160\naddress information,\ncontact info for the examiner, right?\n\n189\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.132\nSo all that information and\nthe company information would be there.\n\n190\n00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:31.890\nNot gonna bother to\npopulate that in the demo.\n\n191\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.782\nJust showing you that\nstuff would be there.\n\n192\n00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.300\nAnd we obviously would\nput that in as well.\n\n193\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.620\nThen, we've got our Case Log Options.\n\n194\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.309\nSo the Case Log is just essentially\na the text file that's gonna be named\n\n195\n00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:47.976\nsomething.log at the end, FTK.log.\n\n196\n00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:54.047\nIn the case folder specific to each case,\nwe automatically track all the activities,\n\n197\n00:09:54.047 --> 00:09:57.387\nactions, things we do,\nwhatever they may be.\n\n198\n00:09:57.387 --> 00:10:00.885\nAnd they go in there, and this is gonna\nbecome the record that we can then look at\n\n199\n00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:03.630\nlater and say we did this things or\ndid them in this order.\n\n200\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.418\nSo what are the things what\nare things that we wanna put in?\n\n201\n00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:07.820\nWhat are the events that we\nwanna put in the Case Log?\n\n202\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.760\nAs you see,\nwe have a pretty simple interface.\n\n203\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.320\nCheck off the things we want.\n\n204\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.180\nNotice they're even checked off for\nus by default.\n\n205\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.740\nIt's not as if we really would have to do\nmuch because we assume that we want all\n\n206\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.480\nthese activities in the Case Log,\nso that makes sense.\n\n207\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.310\nBut if for some reason you didn't\nwant to capture something, right,\n\n208\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.730\nyou would uncheck it here.\n\n209\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.220\nAnd then you would be able\nto just make your choices.\n\n210\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.529\nSo we would just obviously leave\nthose defaults there, click Next.\n\n211\n00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:33.684\nThen our processes to perform, right, so\n\n212\n00:10:33.684 --> 00:10:38.340\nwhen we add evidence into the case file,\nwe do certain things.\n\n213\n00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.840\nWe normally creates hashes of\nthe evidence to digitally sign it.\n\n214\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.570\nWe normally will do certain tests on\nit to make sure it's got validity,\n\n215\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.410\nto make sure that we understand whether\nthe file data is compressed or encrypted.\n\n216\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.065\nSo we'll do an entropy test on that,\n\n217\n00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:54.040\ncuz we'll have to handle\nthat data differently.\n\n218\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.820\nTools like this can actually decrypt DFS\ndata, if we have the DFS recovery keys.\n\n219\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.600\nThere's a lot of features\nthat we can bring to bear.\n\n220\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.075\nWe'll do a full text index, so we can\nsee what the words are in the files,\n\n221\n00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:10.060\nbring those out, export them to a Word\nlist, use that for password cracking.\n\n222\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.574\nA lot of cool stuff we can do with\na tool like this, and so as a result,\n\n223\n00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:15.040\nwe've got to choose.\n\n224\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.510\nAs they say, choose wisely, right?\n\n225\n00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.410\nAnd we have to be able to\ndecide what actions we want.\n\n226\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.130\nAnd again, you'll see most of\nthese are selected by default.\n\n227\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.730\nFile Listing Database, so we keep\ntrack of everything in the file list.\n\n228\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.780\nSo we have essentially a database,\nan Access database file we use that will\n\n229\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.240\ntrack all this information and then allow\nus to export it later if we want to.\n\n230\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.340\nWe can modify the column listing,\nreporting, all that.\n\n231\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.970\nNotice, also, that the bottom items,\nall three, right?\n\n232\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.950\nNotice that HTML File Listing, so\n\n233\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.140\nessentially an HTML\nversion of the file list.\n\n234\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.830\nData carving, as I said, going in and\nfinding specific file types\n\n235\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.630\nembedded in other files,\nrecovering them from free space.\n\n236\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.150\nThis is a steganographic tool that\ndoes recovery for us, as I mentioned.\n\n237\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.650\nAnd registry reports,\n\n238\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.520\ncommon registry information that we'd\nwanna report out on from images.\n\n239\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.390\nNotice those are not selected by default.\n\n240\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.350\nWe can choose them, but\nthey're not selected by default.\n\n241\n00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.830\nAnd we would have to think about that and\nunderstand that and decide whether or\n\n242\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.420\nnot we wanna add that in or not.\n\n243\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.450\nSo here we'll make our choices,\ndo what we wanna do.\n\n244\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.465\nThen, we can go in,\nwe can refine the case defaults.\n\n245\n00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:28.518\nSo we could specify,\nare we gonna use email related settings,\n\n246\n00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:34.100\ntext related settings, graphics related\nsettings, modify those a little bit.\n\n247\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.610\nHow are we gonna add and deal with\nthings like file slack and free space?\n\n248\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.155\nWe've talked about these\nconcepts in some other shows.\n\n249\n00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:45.008\nObviously wanna go back and take a look at\nthose if you're not familiar with them.\n\n250\n00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:49.780\nBut, we wanna capture that space off the\ndrive if we're doing a drive image as our\n\n251\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.532\nentry point for evidence gathering.\n\n252\n00:12:51.532 --> 00:12:54.720\nWe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat information is there.\n\n253\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.350\nSo, we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n254\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.950\nWe're also,\n\n255\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.565\nas you can see here, gonna specify\nhow we deal with file type criteria.\n\n256\n00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:03.445\nSome of it's off to the side,\nlet me move that over.\n\n257\n00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:04.875\nWhat kind of files?\n\n258\n00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:08.245\nYou'll see documents,\nspreadsheets, databases, etc.\n\n259\n00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:10.809\nPretty much, automatically add\neverything and deal with everything.\n\n260\n00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.160\nBut, we may only want certain files.\n\n261\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.730\nWe may, for instance know, or\n\n262\n00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.230\nat least think, that in this particular\nevidence grab, if we're doing a folder,\n\n263\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.710\nlet's say off of a drive, and we know\nthere's only maybe spreadsheets and\n\n264\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.060\nmaybe multimedia files, we're not gonna\nbother adding everything else in.\n\n265\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.870\nSlows down the processing,\nkinda bloats the system a little bit.\n\n266\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.720\nCuz we have to go through a lot\nof other activities before\n\n267\n00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.420\nwe realize there's nothing there.\n\n268\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.090\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n269\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.240\nwe will do an overall case file with\nthe evidence from a hard drive.\n\n270\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.750\nBut then we may start zeroing in and\nadding other bits and pieces.\n\n271\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.660\nAnd if we're just gonna\nselectively pull that in,\n\n272\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.240\nthere's no reason to\ncast a very broad net.\n\n273\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.151\nWe can go ahead and\ndecide to zero in on stuff.\n\n274\n00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:53.920\nSo we could zero in and\nkinda narrow down our focus, if you will.\n\n275\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.379\nSo we can do that.\n\n276\n00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:59.292\nWe can do the refining of the index,\nthe search index as well,\n\n277\n00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:00.590\nessentially the same way.\n\n278\n00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:03.965\nAnd then,\nwe get to the point where we add evidence.\n\n279\n00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:08.275\nAnd adding evidence allows us to go in,\nwe can do logical and\n\n280\n00:14:08.275 --> 00:14:10.645\nphysical drives, we can pull that in.\n\n281\n00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:13.315\nWe can pull in folders,\nindividual files up top.\n\n282\n00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:15.555\nYou can see kinda the listing there.\n\n283\n00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:19.705\nAnd so when we go in and\nwe add evidence, we click there.\n\n284\n00:14:19.705 --> 00:14:21.600\nWe just get essentially a radio button.\n\n285\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.190\nHey, tell me what you gonna do,\nor where you want me to go.\n\n286\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.157\nAnd if it's a image of a drive,\nagain, typically we use a DD image.\n\n287\n00:14:29.157 --> 00:14:30.450\nBut we can use other images.\n\n288\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.700\nI've showed you, I have an image\nfrom a hard drive image in there.\n\n289\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.870\nWe recognize a lot of\ndifferent image types.\n\n290\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.696\nWe could take the local drive.\n\n291\n00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:41.220\nSo if we're gonna be running this,\nand we wanna run it.\n\n292\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.455\nYou don't normally do this, by the way.\n\n293\n00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:44.918\nForensically, this is not\nthe right way to do it.\n\n294\n00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:49.005\nBut if you're running it, let's say,\nas I did, just on the machine that I want\n\n295\n00:14:49.005 --> 00:14:51.628\nto investigate,\nbecause I'm just showing you for\n\n296\n00:14:51.628 --> 00:14:54.860\npurposes of explanation,\nI would add the local drive in.\n\n297\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.553\nWhen we say local drive, what we mean is\nif we have a forensically sound image that\n\n298\n00:14:59.553 --> 00:15:02.384\nwe've created with DD or\nR drive or, whatever,\n\n299\n00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:06.546\nand we just load the image file,\nthat would be an acquired image drive.\n\n300\n00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.864\nIf we actually mount as we may do today,\nan image and\n\n301\n00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:14.881\nmake it a virtual hard drive in a virtual\nmachine, or mount it as a data drive,\n\n302\n00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:20.053\nor if we have the physical drive and we\nwanna actually examine it as a data drive,\n\n303\n00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:24.069\nwe may actually do a bit stream copy,\nso get a duplicate copy,\n\n304\n00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:27.500\nremember drive to drive\ninstead of drive to image.\n\n305\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.210\nWe can make a copy or\na forensically sound image either way.\n\n306\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.600\nWe often has been just saying, hey,\nyou'll make a copy of that and\n\n307\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.798\nyou'll have an image file.\n\n308\n00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:40.060\nBut we can also copy to a physical drive\nand mount the actual drive itself.\n\n309\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.842\nIt's identical in every way,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n310\n00:15:42.842 --> 00:15:46.295\nAnd if we do it that way, we would\nbe doing it as a local drive because\n\n311\n00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:49.275\nessentially now we have that\nphysical drive available.\n\n312\n00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:52.361\nAnd we would be able to go ahead and\njust mount that up.\n\n313\n00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:54.420\nSo we could do that as\nwell if we wanted to.\n\n314\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.821\nSo we could do Local Drive.\n\n315\n00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:57.959\nWe could do Contents of a Folder.\n\n316\n00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:02.643\nSo the folder, any folder, like folder for\nthe pictures on the hard drive that I add,\n\n317\n00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:04.320\nor on my desktop rather.\n\n318\n00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.890\nWe could do Individual File,\njust pull one file out, right?\n\n319\n00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.800\nAnd just go ahead and grab it.\n\n320\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.940\nSo you make the appropriate choice here,\nright?\n\n321\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.080\nWhatever it's going to be.\n\n322\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.120\nSo if we did, let's say,\ncontents of a folder,\n\n323\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.950\njust to show you what it looks like,\nwe hit continue.\n\n324\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.300\nIt has us just go out real quick and\nbrowse,\n\n325\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.540\nhey, where is that,\nwhat kind of folder am I going to grab.\n\n326\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.000\nI just did this to do a picture grab,\nbrought them in, and\n\n327\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.440\nI have a whole bunch of pictures there,\nright?\n\n328\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.160\nSo, we could do whatever we would like.\n\n329\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.170\nSo once you've done that, let's just\nadd one quick thing in, actually,\n\n330\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.540\nsince We're doing that.\n\n331\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.030\nWe'll do our local drive,just\nbring that in real quick.\n\n332\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.020\nAnd let's just do our E drive,\nour fat partition.\n\n333\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.540\nSo let's go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n334\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.280\nYou'll see it says, hey,\nwhat is the evidence display name?\n\n335\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.620\nWe got the location.\n\n336\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.780\nWhat's the display name?\n\n337\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.220\nWhat's the identifier?\n\n338\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.030\nWhat are the comments and also local\nevidence time zone down there at\n\n339\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.150\nthe bottom as I manipulate things\naround the text in box window there.\n\n340\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.870\nYou can see we have to specify\nwhat the time zone is for\n\n341\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.160\nwhere we're actually adding the evidence.\n\n342\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.550\nSo that we know where\nthe investigation was done.\n\n343\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.920\nBecause remember the time zone stamps on\nthe drive will be different than probably,\n\n344\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.140\nmaybe different not necessarily but\nmay be different than where we are,\n\n345\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.240\nwhere we're examining this.\n\n346\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.390\nA lot of times.\n\n347\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.410\nLocal law enforcement will\nget these drives, and\n\n348\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.030\nthey'll do their own investigation.\n\n349\n00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.840\nBut if it becomes a federal investigation\nthey may ship them off to the FBI or\n\n350\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.810\nyou know another agency, ATF or\n\n351\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.110\nwhatever it may be, and they will then\nultimately view the investigation.\n\n352\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.890\nThat may wind up being done\nin a different time zone.\n\n353\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.030\nSo yeah we wanna be able to just make\nnotes of that stuff in the record\n\n354\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:36.910\nTo have a sense of that.\n\n355\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.950\nSo, we're just gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n356\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:45.730\nWe'll just call this E,\nwhoops, call this fat E, right?\n\n357\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.500\nAs in the fat partition E drive.\n\n358\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.790\n&gt;&gt; It's an overweight partition.\n\n359\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.250\nIt's very\n&gt;&gt; No, we don't say that.\n\n360\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is just a partition that\n\n361\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.830\nis going to have to work a little\nharder than everybody else.\n\n362\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.080\nAll right so Edrive, right,\nwe're just gonna label that so we know.\n\n363\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.700\nWe'll choose a time zone there.\n\n364\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.770\nLet's say,\nwhere do you want to go today, right?\n\n365\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.030\nWhere do you think?\n\n366\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.590\nI'm thinking maybe we go to Guinea-Bissau?\n\n367\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.580\nWhat do you think?\n\n368\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.490\n&gt;&gt; What the heck,\nwe're feeling adventurous today.\n\n369\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's do Guinea-Bissau, so\n\n370\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.610\nwe're gonna go in there, do a little\n&gt;&gt; Beside action on our time zone,\n\n371\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.380\ncan add that in, and once we've done that.\n\n372\n00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.850\n&gt;&gt; It is an international thing.\n\n373\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.700\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nInternational flavor, and\n\n374\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.120\nrichness of data forensic\ninvestigations here at continental TV.\n\n375\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.700\nIt is continent, so you could see,\nwe got all that information filled up,\n\n376\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.640\nobviously we would stack\nin our information there,\n\n377\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.380\ncarry in one after the other,\nadding all the files things we wanna do.\n\n378\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Click Next there we kinda have\nnow a new case complete screen.\n\n379\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.860\nThis is that summary screen that like\nall good IT administrators nobody\n\n380\n00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.500\never reads a page attention to.\n\n381\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.780\nWe just keep hitting Enter, Enter,\n\n382\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.190\nEnter and so we actually get to something\nthat is approximating a finish line.\n\n383\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.040\nBut all kidding aside as an investigator,\n\n384\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.000\nyou obviously wanna double\ncheck what you did here right.\n\n385\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.907\nIf you made a mistake,\nthis would be the better time to catch and\n\n386\n00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:04.251\nthen after you go to all this\ntrouble create the file.\n\n387\n00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:08.978\nYou know parse all of that information and\nthen we go wow, I've got to redo that.\n\n388\n00:19:08.978 --> 00:19:12.013\nYou spend an hour you don't\nget to where want to be.\n\n389\n00:19:12.013 --> 00:19:13.438\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n390\n00:19:13.438 --> 00:19:16.727\nSo we going tolet that do its thing,\nwe'll hit finish there.\n\n391\n00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:21.373\nIt's going to start in the information to\nthis human records you could see that it's\n\n392\n00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:24.907\ngoing in and requiring the drive\nadding illusion is loading file\n\n393\n00:19:24.907 --> 00:19:28.060\nafter file behind the since\n&gt;&gt; This filtering test kind of tells you\n\n394\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.170\nwhat it's doing, you know,\ncurrent information on the left,\n\n395\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.530\ntotal overall stats on the right,\nhow many items added, how many index.\n\n396\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.610\nWe can specify hey,\nwe know it's gonna run for a while.\n\n397\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.490\nAnd some of these can take\na long time to build.\n\n398\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.980\nIf you're adding in Thousands of items,\nit make take an hour or two for\n\n399\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.060\nthe tool to just go out and\nindex everything.\n\n400\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.800\nSo hey, update me every so many minutes,\nand tell me what's going on, and\n\n401\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.880\nlog every so many minutes so\nwe can keep track.\n\n402\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.330\nSo we just kinda do that.\n\n403\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.060\nIt's doing its thing, and\nit's going to run for a while.\n\n404\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.470\nIt'll take a little bit.\n\n405\n00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.350\nOkay, there we go.\nIt's a very small partition, so\n\n406\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.510\nit doesn't take too long.\n\n407\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.620\nBut when I did the full one,\n\n408\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.100\nwhere I grabbed everything including\nthe NTFS, Partition on the C drive.\n\n409\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.400\nIt took about 30 minutes\nto bring everything in.\n\n410\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.470\nIt actually can take a bit of time.\n\n411\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:16.360\nSo once we've done that we then have,\nas you can see,\n\n412\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.390\nsubstantially less items than what I had\nwith the case I built out to start with.\n\n413\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.010\nWe have four documents, it looks like.\n\n414\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:28.210\n39 executables, got a whole bunch\nof slack free space in there.\n\n415\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.750\nGot 229 items added to the overall\nthing or overall case there.\n\n416\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.790\nLooks like we got 57 deleted files.\n\n417\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.120\nLooks like we pick up some different\ninformation on this, right?\n\n418\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.760\nSo I can go in and I can click\non deleted files for instance \\.\n\n419\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.080\nAnd you'll see that when I do that,\nI've got all sorts of stuff there\n\n420\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.290\nthat comes back, and\nwe can actually see what it looks like.\n\n421\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.120\nWe could see the document of doom,\nas we've talked about in other episodes.\n\n422\n00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.730\nThat is the document, that is our flag,\n\n423\n00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.630\nour test document that we use to measure\nwhether or not we can find our deleted\n\n424\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.180\ndata in that masterfully created\npartition on the E-drive that we set up.\n\n425\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.800\nSo you could see All of that is there, so\nthis tool does fine, And, remember, some\n\n426\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.850\nof the tools in some of our other demos,\nwhere we looked at the data recovery, data\n\n427\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.010\nacquisition, duplication, and replication\ninformation, in those sessions,\n\n428\n00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.010\nwhen we went through and did that, we ran\nseveral tools against the E partition.\n\n429\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.070\nOne of them did pick up\nthe file in the folders,\n\n430\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.720\nif you were the files in the folder,\nif you remember, but then,\n\n431\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.430\nwe also saw that some did not, right\n&gt;&gt; And so it really is a matter of that.\n\n432\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.420\nBut you can see that document is there\nalong with a whole bunch of other stuff,\n\n433\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.560\nas you can see.\n\n434\n00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.380\nSo we actually could go in.\n\n435\n00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.780\nWe could highlight that document,\nin theory, lets just say.\n\n436\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.280\nAnd you'll see that we\ncould get a preview of it\n\n437\n00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.030\nif there was something in the document.\n\n438\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.420\nI've gone out and removed the information\nthat people are not supposed to see in\n\n439\n00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.700\nthe document of doom, because if you did,\nIt would be your due, right?\n\n440\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.140\nWe want you to be safe here at ITProTV.\n\n441\n00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.480\nSo we could preview the document\nif there was anything in there.\n\n442\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.400\n&gt;&gt; The OSHA approved preview of.\n\n443\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.220\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is, only four people that\nare approved to see it, absolutely.\n\n444\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.560\nSo we could go in, if we go to chfi test,\nright, we see that there's a folder there.\n\n445\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.530\nWe've got some other stuff.\n\n446\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.871\nLet's just scroll down here,\nsee what else we've got.\n\n447\n00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:24.993\nWe've got,\nAnother Word document nothing in there.\n\n448\n00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:27.050\nYou'll know our substance\ntoo in another words.\n\n449\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.700\nI'm just trying to remember\nif I have a text file or\n\n450\n00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.710\nanything on that particular one.\n\n451\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.920\nI don't think I do.\n\n452\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.520\nBut let's just hypothetically\ngrab a folder for just a minute.\n\n453\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.260\nI just grabbed the test folder down\nthere at the bottom, as you can see.\n\n454\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.340\nAnd look at some of\nthe stuff I can do with it.\n\n455\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.570\nI can go ahead, I can,\nyou'll launch a detached viewer.\n\n456\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.640\nKind of bring it up separately.\n\n457\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.060\nYou see a little preview up above.\n\n458\n00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.290\nI can break that viewer out,\ninteract with it.\n\n459\n00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.350\nI can launch an associated program.\n\n460\n00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.980\nSo, if this was a Word document, I can\nactually launch Word on my machine and\n\n461\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.060\nview it directly.\n\n462\n00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.840\nSo, I can actually open.\n\n463\n00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.530\nAssuming the program is there, of course.\n\n464\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.530\nI could do that.\n\n465\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.590\nI can go and find this folder or whatever\ninformation this is on the disk image.\n\n466\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.090\nOr on the local disk drive, so\nI could actually go examine it there.\n\n467\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.230\nI could view the file sectors,\nwhere this actual information is stored.\n\n468\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.350\nWe've talked about sectors, clusters,\n\n469\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.250\nallocation units all that in the hard\ndrive and file system shows,\n\n470\n00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.020\nyou want to go back and look at\nthose if you haven't seen those yet.\n\n471\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.410\nWe could export them so I can actually\nexport this and pull it out, so\n\n472\n00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.880\nI can use it separately.\n\n473\n00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.389\nI can go ahead and\nI can use analysis tools on this.\n\n474\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.190\nAnd I can actually go in and\ndig deeper into this particular item and\n\n475\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.490\nI can look at properties of it.\n\n476\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.704\nSo I can actually see so let's go in and\ntake a look I can actually see and\n\n477\n00:23:40.704 --> 00:23:43.491\nlet me do this just bring\nup file properties and\n\n478\n00:23:43.491 --> 00:23:48.134\nI'll show you what we get there So file\nproperties on this I can go in I could see\n\n479\n00:23:48.134 --> 00:23:51.377\nthe general info ,kinda when it created,\nall that.\n\n480\n00:23:51.377 --> 00:23:56.098\nI can go thru file source info, I could do\nfile content info case-specific info, so\n\n481\n00:23:56.098 --> 00:23:59.302\nI can actually throw in and\nsee a lot of information here.\n\n482\n00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:00.692\nAround the various things.\n\n483\n00:24:00.692 --> 00:24:04.080\nAnd as we just kind of go through and\nwe take a look,\n\n484\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.118\nI can see the sector information there.\n\n485\n00:24:07.118 --> 00:24:08.670\nSo I could actually see the starting and\n\n486\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.030\nending point on the cluster\ninformation for the drive.\n\n487\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.170\nSo I can see how much space it takes up.\n\n488\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.744\nItem number tells what item number it is,\nso tracking purposes.\n\n489\n00:24:17.744 --> 00:24:23.573\nI can go in and if there's any content\ninfo in there, is it encrypted?\n\n490\n00:24:23.573 --> 00:24:24.946\nDoes it have a password on it?\n\n491\n00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:25.740\nThings like that.\n\n492\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.490\nI could take a look, I could see that.\n\n493\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.120\nIf there is a hash available for it,\n\n494\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.670\nif I've created a hash associated with\nit I can actually take a look at that.\n\n495\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.820\nSo there's a lot of information here\nthat I would be able to reference.\n\n496\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.030\nAnd it kind brings it all together on\nthe last screen and summarizes it for me.\n\n497\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.890\nRight?\nSo this is what we would get we just\n\n498\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.160\na simple right click and then an ability\nto be able to go on and take a look.\n\n499\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.780\nSomething like a dll, we're not gonna be\nable to preview the filters are not gonna\n\n500\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.860\npreview that for us cuz remember dlls are\ngonna be in a typically file of a certain\n\n501\n00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.020\ntype that we probably don't normally read.\n\n502\n00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.810\nIt's not in human readable format.\n\n503\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.060\nSo some of these files\nwon't preview out but\n\n504\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.320\nif you have, for instance,\nsomething like this, right?\n\n505\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.450\nIf you have a message file which\nis essentially a text file,\n\n506\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.620\nI could actually preview that file.\n\n507\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.050\nSo I could just highlight it and you could\nsee that I can go in and I can actually\n\n508\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.850\nsee the contents of the file just by\nhighlighting it and taking a look at it.\n\n509\n00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.607\nSo email messages, spreadsheets,\nWord documents, Powerpoints, images,\n\n510\n00:25:22.607 --> 00:25:26.022\nI'll show you some graphics\non the other case I created.\n\n511\n00:25:26.022 --> 00:25:27.390\nSome images.\nThose will come up and\n\n512\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.830\nwe'll be able to find those and\ninteract with those and\n\n513\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.000\npreview those with no trouble in here.\n\n514\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.640\nAll right.\n\n515\n00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.590\nSo this is kind of interesting so\nwe can do through,\n\n516\n00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.510\nwe can kind of drill down\ntake a look at all this.\n\n517\n00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.110\nWe can go in to explore and\nwe can see a different view here.\n\n518\n00:25:42.736 --> 00:25:46.160\nAnd you'll see we see just like\na hierarchical view of the drive,\n\n519\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.910\nthe recycle bin folder we did the recycle\n\n520\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.710\nforensics on the recycle bin\nforensics in a prior episode.\n\n521\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.580\nShowed you how to go in and\nrecover information from that.\n\n522\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.950\nWe could drill in and essentially\nwe can send kind of thing here.\n\n523\n00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.290\nWe could see the temp files, we could see\nthe CHFI test and that kind of stuff.\n\n524\n00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.540\nSo, I can go in, I can grab one of\nthose and I can start drilling down and\n\n525\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.960\nanalyzing and looking at information.\n\n526\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.210\nSame kind of thing that essentially\nwe were able to do in the other area.\n\n527\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.310\nYou could see the menu and\nsome of the stuff that I can do there.\n\n528\n00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.880\nIf I have any graphics,\n\n529\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.480\nI would be able to see them here\nif there are any graphics files.\n\n530\n00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.570\nWe'll take a look at some\nof those in just a minute.\n\n531\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.330\nIf I have any email.\n\n532\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.790\nYou'll see that if there is any web\nemail or other email categories\n\n533\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.080\nI'd be able to pull those messages out and\nactually take a look at them.\n\n534\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.840\nSo I would be able to drill in,\nkind of see email messages from a PSD or\n\n535\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.840\nOSV archive.\n\n536\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.470\nOr if I had one on the local drive that\none obviously is gonna be very valuable to\n\n537\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.860\nus if we have that.\n\n538\n00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.270\nI can do some searching here.\n\n539\n00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.570\nSo with a word index and\n\n540\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.670\nthe index system running I can\nactually do a keyword searches.\n\n541\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.060\nThis is one of the ways in\nwhich meta data becomes so\n\n542\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.620\ncritical to us because remember meta data\nincorporates typically keyword tags at\n\n543\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.690\nleast more often than not\nthese days it does right?\n\n544\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.540\nAnd so as a result I can go in and\nI could potentially do something like\n\n545\n00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.480\nyou know searching for a term such as\ndoom you know hypothetically right?\n\n546\n00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.210\nAnd when I do that you'll see that index\nwords, words that are gonna look or\n\n547\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.650\nbe similar to doom start to show up.\n\n548\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.750\nTells me how many incidents we have,\nwhere they are and\n\n549\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.830\nI can highlight that term and\nbegin to pull information related to it.\n\n550\n00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.890\nSo I can start to do a forensic\nsearch that involves narrowing down\n\n551\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.460\non certain key words like account\nnumber you know Bank of America.\n\n552\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.450\nHealth record or electronic record\ndata for patient x or whatever, and\n\n553\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.670\nif there's data associated with\nthese terms, I will begin to see it.\n\n554\n00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.780\nAnd as a result, I could begin to\npull the evidence together and\n\n555\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:44.180\nthen start to stitch together information\nin this area that shows me what's there.\n\n556\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.590\nNow this is an index search,\n\n557\n00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.570\nmeaning on this tab at the upper left\nI am doing a search from the index.\n\n558\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.300\nI could do a live search because\nsince I'm adding evidence,\n\n559\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.060\nit may not always be indexed right away.\n\n560\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.200\nI can actually go in and do a live search\nagainst all the data, whether it's been\n\n561\n00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.030\nindexed or not, using the other tab\njust off to the right from Index Search.\n\n562\n00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.470\nAnd notice I could import, so I could\nactually import a list of search terms.\n\n563\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.630\nI can, I think I mentioned we create a\nword list, we can export that, or get that\n\n564\n00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.172\nfrom another tool, and I can import\nthat word list here, looking for terms.\n\n565\n00:28:13.172 --> 00:28:15.840\nSo I'd be able to drill through the data,\nand\n\n566\n00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.010\nI can do a bullion search,\nso and and or operators.\n\n567\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.750\nI can add in connectors and\ndo a bunch of different stuff,\n\n568\n00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.000\nto be able to build\ncomplex search strings.\n\n569\n00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.990\nSo it's actually very interesting and\n\n570\n00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.322\nvery dynamic set of tools\nthat we are given access to.\n\n571\n00:28:28.322 --> 00:28:32.630\nAll right and so when we are done with\ncreating a case file like we did here.\n\n572\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:40.250\nAnd we go to close the case, we can save\nit, we can back it up, we can export it.\n\n573\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.890\nSo let's assume for just a minute\nthat we going to want to save our\n\n574\n00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.720\nwork that is normally what we wanna do so\nwe can go ahead.\n\n575\n00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.530\nWe could save case, alright.\n\n576\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.340\nWe could then go do Close.\n\n577\n00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.201\nIt's gonna close the case, And\n\n578\n00:28:58.201 --> 00:29:02.270\nthen it just leaves us ready\nto open up another case.\n\n579\n00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.840\nAnd we can see the FDK file there which is\nthe case file that is created if I just go\n\n580\n00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.910\nto reopen it.\n\n581\n00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.060\nCase file that's created right there\nin the Daniel's Machine folder,\n\n582\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.610\nwhere I set the case up, right?\n\n583\n00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.540\nSo all that is there.\n\n584\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.220\n&gt;&gt; Is it that file that's submitted as\nevidence or as a report or whatever?\n\n585\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.740\n&gt;&gt; So we could submit that file.\n\n586\n00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.240\nBut I'm gonna show you\nhow to generate a report.\n\n587\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.470\nWe actually have a report capability.\n\n588\n00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.390\nWe're gonna do that right now.\n\n589\n00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.020\nBut we have to open back up\nthe case in order to do that.\n\n590\n00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.080\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n591\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.720\nBut Daniel's question is spot on in the\nsense that hey, what do we submit, right?\n\n592\n00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.260\nSometimes the attorney that we're\nworking for, prosecution or\n\n593\n00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.620\ndefense, will say, hey,\nwe just want the report, right?\n\n594\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.720\nCuz essentially we want\nthe summary of findings.\n\n595\n00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.670\nBut we may also put in all\nthe information we found in\n\n596\n00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:49.060\nterms of the file itself and the evidence\nso that way the court has everything.\n\n597\n00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.110\nWe can reference it and\n\n598\n00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.930\nsay yeah, this is a summery report\nof what's in the case file.\n\n599\n00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.160\nThe report you're gonna see is gonna be\na formal report generated by the tool,\n\n600\n00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.280\nlooks official.\n\n601\n00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.868\nIs kind of stamped that way.\n\n602\n00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:04.720\nMore often than not we can do that, but a\nlot of times we wanna submit the case file\n\n603\n00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.040\nas well so that if there's ever\na question, they can go back and\n\n604\n00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.610\nessentially say yep this does match right.\n\n605\n00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.730\nEssentially this is good.\n\n606\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.340\nSo let's go back to the machine.\n\n607\n00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.280\nLet's just go ahead and reopen that case.\n\n608\n00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.610\nSo let's do that.\n\n609\n00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.030\nWe'll just bring that back in real quick.\n\n610\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.590\nYou could see all the evidence is back,\nit's all right there.\n\n611\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.328\nSo we know we just loaded it back up.\n\n612\n00:30:23.328 --> 00:30:25.820\nSo to Daniel's point,\nhey if we're gonna wanna do that and\n\n613\n00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.430\nget a report going what do we do?\n\n614\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:32.000\nSo over here, we can do our little\nreport wizard/viewreport we're\n\n615\n00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.970\ngonna obviously create a report first so\nlet's just go and do that real quick.\n\n616\n00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.426\nWhoops hold on one second.\n\n617\n00:30:39.426 --> 00:30:41.260\nI'm sorry I hit the wrong button.\n\n618\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.420\nLittle too excited there.\n\n619\n00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.000\nGotta create the report\nbefore we can view it.\n\n620\n00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.300\nSo we gotta give it some information,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n621\n00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.260\nyou see we have the option to include our\ninvestigative information in there so\n\n622\n00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.680\nyou know who we are, our address all that,\nwe always wanna do that so\n\n623\n00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.207\nthe court knows who we are and\nthat we did the work.\n\n624\n00:30:57.207 --> 00:31:01.697\nSo we're gonna do that,\nwe'll just have that there.\n\n625\n00:31:01.697 --> 00:31:04.410\nAre there any bookmarks\nthat we have created?\n\n626\n00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.950\nBookmarks are going to be items that you\ncreate during the investigation when you\n\n627\n00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.120\nfind something of interest, like that\nfolder the Document of Doom or whatever.\n\n628\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.460\nWe're gonna bookmark it so\n\n629\n00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.980\nthat way it shows up in\na separate section of the report.\n\n630\n00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.010\nThese will be highlighted items that\nwe want to draw someone's attention\n\n631\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.950\nto, right?\n\n632\n00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.250\nSo, for instance, let's just go back,\n\n633\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.260\ncuz I didn't actually create\na bookmark on anything.\n\n634\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.540\nSo, let's go grab this particular item,\nand\n\n635\n00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.940\nyou'll see that when I have the Document\nof Doom, if I right click Create Bookmark,\n\n636\n00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.310\nI'm gonna be able to call out that\ndocument, and say essentially hey, Daniel,\n\n637\n00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.890\nwhen you read this report, this document\nthis is gonna be really important.\n\n638\n00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.080\nYou should definitely take a look at that.\n\n639\n00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.990\nSo, I'm gonna bookmark it just so\nwhen we pull it out for\n\n640\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.755\nthe report we'll actually see\nsomething under that section, right.\n\n641\n00:31:43.755 --> 00:31:44.650\nKind of separately.\n\n642\n00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.330\nOtherwise it's a pretty short report.\n\n643\n00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.540\nThere isn't to much there.\n\n644\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.830\nSo, we'll create a bookmark.\n\n645\n00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:54.345\nSo, we'll call it bookmark name doom one,\n\n646\n00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:59.721\nbookmark comment Crazy cool doc, right?\n\n647\n00:31:59.721 --> 00:32:03.296\nSomething like that, you'd be a little\nbit more formal in the real world,\n\n648\n00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:06.330\nwe have the file there as you can\nsee where it was found, right?\n\n649\n00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.760\nWe have that information,\nwe're gonna go ahead and check off\n\n650\n00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.140\nto include it in the reports, so we're\ngonna make sure its part of the report.\n\n651\n00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.350\nIf it is going to be the email,\nlet's say with an attachment,\n\n652\n00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.540\nwe can specify hey, we want\nthe attachments, it's part of the email.\n\n653\n00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.168\nSo we can grab all that but this is not\nan email, but you will get the idea.\n\n654\n00:32:23.168 --> 00:32:24.480\nSo we'll click OK.\n\n655\n00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.630\nSo now we've got at least one\nitem that's bookmarked, right?\n\n656\n00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:33.285\nSo now we just quickly go back, we'll do\nour report, we'll include everything.\n\n657\n00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:37.485\nAnd include all bookmarks, got all that,\ngot all that, got all that.\n\n658\n00:32:37.485 --> 00:32:42.375\nAny bookmarks that come from additional\nsources, couple of different places,\n\n659\n00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:43.165\nwe'll get them.\n\n660\n00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:44.725\nWe can add certain properties and\n\n661\n00:32:44.725 --> 00:32:47.785\nthings based on the kind of file it is,\nwe'll do all that.\n\n662\n00:32:47.785 --> 00:32:50.865\nThen we have to specify how\nwe wanna deal with graphics,\n\n663\n00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:52.295\nnow we don't have any\npictures in this case.\n\n664\n00:32:52.295 --> 00:32:55.050\nI'll show them to you in the other case,\nwe'll drill in to the other one,\n\n665\n00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.890\nin a minute,\nI'll show you what pictures look like.\n\n666\n00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.740\nBut assuming we had graphic files,\nwe could actually include them and\n\n667\n00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.530\nexport them.\n\n668\n00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.090\nSo we could actually give you a copy\nof the pictures we've done ahead.\n\n669\n00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.990\nWe've decided we want to use or\npresent and\n\n670\n00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.440\nwe could present them in the report and\nexport them as attachments.\n\n671\n00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.860\nSo we could actually do that as well.\n\n672\n00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.200\nSo we can specify so\nmany one per row, one per row,\n\n673\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.080\none per page kind of a general set up,\nright, on the report.\n\n674\n00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.980\nSo we'll do all that, we'll then be\nable to list files by file path.\n\n675\n00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.460\nSo you'll see here include a list\nby file path section in the report,\n\n676\n00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.710\nshow me where all the files are, show me\nwhat the path was, that kind of thing.\n\n677\n00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.710\nSo we can go ahead, set that up and\n\n678\n00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.900\nthen we can decide if we want\nto include them, yes or no.\n\n679\n00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.810\nAnd we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll select that particular item,\n\n680\n00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.600\nright, and we can specify yeah,\nwe want to include these.\n\n681\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.030\nOops, let me do that there.\n\n682\n00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.120\nWe'll export them out and\n\n683\n00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.150\nwe can specify what the filename\nis that we want to include.\n\n684\n00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.690\nSo let's say that we want email items or\nlet's say\n\n685\n00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.560\nthat we want graphics files, right, or\ndeleted items or whatever the case may be.\n\n686\n00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.640\nWe can choose those and\n\n687\n00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.670\nthen those will get included and\nwe can pull those together, right?\n\n688\n00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.690\nSo we have some different options here.\n\n689\n00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.950\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's say what do we watch?\n\n690\n00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:27.677\nAnd then do the same thing there.\n\n691\n00:34:27.677 --> 00:34:30.841\nAnd we got our property items\nthat will be included and\n\n692\n00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:33.443\nany supplementary files that we wanna add,\n\n693\n00:34:33.443 --> 00:34:37.609\nif there's anything additional that\nmaybe we have and wanna pack on.\n\n694\n00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:38.980\nYou would add those in there.\n\n695\n00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.030\nAnd then where are we\ngoing to put the report,\n\n696\n00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.110\nso we're gonna specify where to save it.\n\n697\n00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:50.300\nWhat we wanna do, export any and\nall files including things like CDs and\n\n698\n00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.530\ncustom graphics.\n\n699\n00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.810\nWhat language we want the report in,\nsupport multiple languages.\n\n700\n00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.500\nSo we're gonna have all that and you'll\nsee it's gonna be in the case folder.\n\n701\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.450\nIt's just gonna be\na subdirectory called Report, so\n\n702\n00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.890\nwe're just gonna do that real quick.\n\n703\n00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.470\nGive that a minute to render.\n\n704\n00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.130\nAnd then once that's done, we can go and\n\n705\n00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.940\nthen view the report [INAUDIBLE]\nhave pulled a report file up.\n\n706\n00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.300\nSo we'll give that a second.\n\n707\n00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.150\nThis will be a smaller one,\nthe one that's for\n\n708\n00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.680\nthe large case file,\nthe 5,000 items will be much bigger.\n\n709\n00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.880\nBut we can at least get a sense\nof what a report looks like.\n\n710\n00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.840\nAnd then once this is done rendering, I'll\nshow you what the report looks like so\n\n711\n00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.450\nwe can answer Daniel's question\nauthoritavitly by showing you the form.\n\n712\n00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:27.490\nAnd then I wanna show you what some\ngraphic files look like, just to pick them\n\n713\n00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.300\nup out of the other case and see\na little bit more about the file types.\n\n714\n00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.790\nSo do you wanna view the report?\n\n715\n00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.569\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n716\n00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.470\nSo it's an HTML report, right?\n\n717\n00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:41.640\nSo we can bring this up, let's just\ngo here and what we can see is yeah,\n\n718\n00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.510\nwe've got the FTK case report.\n\n719\n00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.320\nAgain, depending on version of the tool\nit may look slightly different in\n\n720\n00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.960\nnewer versions, that kind of thing.\n\n721\n00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.800\nWe got the case information,\ntells us what the build number is,\n\n722\n00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.610\nthe path location, kind of who created it,\nwhen, all that stuff.\n\n723\n00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.350\nObviously, that's really important, right?\n\n724\n00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.620\nWe have all that.\n\n725\n00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.800\nAnd then you'll see here\nwe have our case log.\n\n726\n00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.160\nOff to the left, we have a link,\nwe have File Overview,\n\n727\n00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.210\nEvidence List,\nwe have the File listing database.\n\n728\n00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.510\nRemember I said we'd create\nthat file listing in access,\n\n729\n00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.990\nwe have an access database\nthat we actually export.\n\n730\n00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.610\nThat you can load up and\nyou can go through and\n\n731\n00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.240\nactually look at the individual items and\ninteract with them.\n\n732\n00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.855\nWe have a list of all the file properties,\nwe have our bookmarks,\n\n733\n00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:27.214\nnotice Doom 1 is there, so there is our\nbookmark for the item of Doom, right?\n\n734\n00:36:27.214 --> 00:36:28.753\nAnd we don't have any graphics but\n\n735\n00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:31.400\nif we did we would have\nactually exported those here.\n\n736\n00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.660\nSo we can click through, right,\n\n737\n00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.830\nwe can kind of see case information, File\noverview gives us a high level summary.\n\n738\n00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.920\nEvidence List tells us what's there.\n\n739\n00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.740\nCase log, we can look at the case log,\nkind of see everything.\n\n740\n00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.130\nWe can get a list of all the properties,\nso list all files.\n\n741\n00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.080\nAnd you could see as we go down,\nit's just got item after item.\n\n742\n00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.520\nEverything is listed there, right?\n\n743\n00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.750\nSo it's all there.\n\n744\n00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:59.120\nIf we go in, go to Doom 1, it actually has\nthe bookmark for this document, right?\n\n745\n00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.390\nSo it tells us what it is,\nwhere it is, information about it.\n\n746\n00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.417\nSo we could draw the people's attention to\nwhatever item it is that we may wanna use.\n\n747\n00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:08.610\nThere's a little comment up above, right?\n\n748\n00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.830\nAnd that kind of stuff.\n\n749\n00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.320\nAnd if we did the file listing database,\nwe'll actually,\n\n750\n00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.050\nyou'll see get prompted to bring down and\nopen up an access database.\n\n751\n00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.620\nSo we can actually pull that in.\n\n752\n00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.750\nObviously we have to have access\navailable, but assuming we did,\n\n753\n00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.870\nwe could actually open that up and\nwe'd actually be able to interact with it.\n\n754\n00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.840\nSo we're able to present\nall that information.\n\n755\n00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.530\nSo let's do the following,\nlet's just get rid of that for a second.\n\n756\n00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.050\nLet's open up the other case, right?\n\n757\n00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.720\nSo let's go back,\nlet's open up our other case.\n\n758\n00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.690\nSo let's get up to our desktop here.\n\n759\n00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.700\nLet's open up my other case\nthat has the 5,000 items.\n\n760\n00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.160\nImport that one.\n\n761\n00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.200\nThat's gonna then let us go in,\nlook at some graphics files,\n\n762\n00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.730\njust show you what pictures will look\nlike when we go in and we preview.\n\n763\n00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.500\nSo let's go in,\nlet's grab something that may be cool.\n\n764\n00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.190\nThought you may appreciate this one,\nright?\n\n765\n00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.540\nSo, got some Cubans cigars sitting there-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n766\n00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.580\n&gt;&gt; So we got obviously somebody\nwho's potentially been up to no\n\n767\n00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.470\ngood in-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n768\n00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.740\n&gt;&gt; Trading a contraband.\n\n769\n00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.242\nThose are actually mine\nby the way [LAUGH].\n\n770\n00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:10.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we could see that.\n\n771\n00:38:10.136 --> 00:38:13.630\nIf you guys wanna see me,\nthere I am right there, so there's me.\n\n772\n00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.243\nMy smiling face, you could see, look.\n\n773\n00:38:16.243 --> 00:38:17.064\nBasically the same.\n\n774\n00:38:17.064 --> 00:38:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Behind the contraband [LAUGH].\n\n775\n00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.160\n&gt;&gt; It's right after I smoked\none of my contraband cigars.\n\n776\n00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.730\nSo you could see we've got all\nsorts of stuff in there, right?\n\n777\n00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.290\nWe've got all of these,\nI just dumped a bunch of pictures out\n\n778\n00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.770\nof a picture folder through [INAUDIBLE]\ncase, but you could see the idea.\n\n779\n00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:35.330\nWe could go and grab these pictures and\nagain, if I wanted to do something,\n\n780\n00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.810\nI could, as you saw,\ncreate a bookmark, use that file.\n\n781\n00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.230\nI could add it to the case file,\n\n782\n00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.300\nI could do all sorts of stuff,\nwhatever the case may be, right?\n\n783\n00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.500\nSo we're able to go in and\nview this information and\n\n784\n00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.910\nwe're also able to go in and\nview a variety of other things.\n\n785\n00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.000\nLet's just take a look.\n\n786\n00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.660\nWe've got spreadsheets in there, right?\n\n787\n00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.700\nSo hypothetically, in this one,\n\n788\n00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.380\ncuz I added a bunch of documents I\ncould see some different spreadsheets.\n\n789\n00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.270\nCISSP Algorithms,\nthat looks highly suspicious.\n\n790\n00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:06.040\nSo we may go in and take a look at that or\nCompTIA show notes for\n\n791\n00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.400\nCisco or whatever the case may be.\n\n792\n00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.630\nSo I got some of that.\n\n793\n00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:12.400\nNow obviously,\nI said I could actually preview it.\n\n794\n00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.790\nSo click on it and you could actually\nsee a preview of the file, right?\n\n795\n00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.450\nSo we have file filters, right, that\nwill preview a lot of this information.\n\n796\n00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.280\nI think that's my spreadsheet show\nnotes from our CSP show that Don and\n\n797\n00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.330\nI did the first one.\n\n798\n00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.730\nSo we've got all that.\n\n799\n00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:30.370\nWe've got, what else did we want to take a\nlook at here, documents real quick, right?\n\n800\n00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.110\nSo we didn't actually preview a document.\n\n801\n00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.200\nSo let's go in and you see all this\ndifferent stuff that's in here, but\n\n802\n00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.110\nlet's go and for instance, right,\nyou got some sort of HTML code.\n\n803\n00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.606\nSome of these things may or\nmay not preview out.\n\n804\n00:39:44.606 --> 00:39:48.752\nHere's a PDF right here and although it's\nkind of hard to see cuz it's very small,\n\n805\n00:39:48.752 --> 00:39:51.358\nI could blow that up and\nactually preview the PDF, so\n\n806\n00:39:51.358 --> 00:39:52.855\nI can see the PDF file as well.\n\n807\n00:39:52.855 --> 00:39:54.472\nWe would just have to zoom in of course,\n\n808\n00:39:54.472 --> 00:39:56.385\nbut I can actually get\na preview on that image.\n\n809\n00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:58.622\nSo I can see all sorts of stuff in there.\n\n810\n00:39:58.622 --> 00:40:04.440\nI've also got information on file\nslack and slack space on the drive.\n\n811\n00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.390\nAnd I can see it here and\n\n812\n00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.500\nit shows me where information may be\nhiding in the free space on the drive.\n\n813\n00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.920\nSo I can actually preview.\n\n814\n00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.190\nAnd take a look at that FileSlack and\nyou could see over here,\n\n815\n00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:18.780\nit shows me the type, the file type and\nthe category Slack/Free space and whether\n\n816\n00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.330\nit's drive free space for FileSlack and\nso I could take a look at that.\n\n817\n00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.590\nSo I could drill through,\nI could see executables, right and\n\n818\n00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.400\nI can look at whole bunch of these,\nthere's some of the access.\n\n819\n00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.800\nFile data executables directly so\n\n820\n00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.020\nI could take a look at essentially\nthe program itself and I could go in and\n\n821\n00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.830\nlook at the properties of\nthe executable if I wanted to.\n\n822\n00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.830\nSo I'm able to drill in,\n\n823\n00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.730\nand I'm able to see just about anything\nthat you can think of in here.\n\n824\n00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.660\nI dont have any encrypted files or\ne-mail files.\n\n825\n00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.453\nBut if I did,\nI would be able to pull those out as well.\n\n826\n00:40:48.453 --> 00:40:51.310\nI've also got data carved files.\n\n827\n00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:56.356\nFiles that I went in and I pulled and that\nI was able through the use of the carving\n\n828\n00:40:56.356 --> 00:41:01.194\ntool to pull out steganographic images\nfrom other images that I had setup.\n\n829\n00:41:01.194 --> 00:41:04.568\nThat I had essentially hidden in there and\nI actually am able to carve them and\n\n830\n00:41:04.568 --> 00:41:05.316\nbring them out.\n\n831\n00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:09.251\nSo I'm able to pull these pieces together\nand say hey this image apparently\n\n832\n00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:12.890\nwas hidden somewhere else and\nwas carved out of an existing file.\n\n833\n00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.100\nAnd I'm able to see all those.\n\n834\n00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.289\nAnd so,\nI can see all the carves that I did.\n\n835\n00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:18.460\nI have to go in and\nrequest that the system do that.\n\n836\n00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.870\nAnd under Tools, let's just take a look\nat the tool list really quickly here.\n\n837\n00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.340\nUnder Tools, what I can do is I can go in.\n\n838\n00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.900\nAnd I can as you see create bookmarks,\ndo analysis, do all sorts of stuff.\n\n839\n00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:37.520\nOops, let me scroll down towards here.\n\n840\n00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.780\nAnd I can encrypt and\n\n841\n00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.980\ndecrypt and if you noticed kind of in\nthe middle I can do data carving as well.\n\n842\n00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.490\nAnd so\nyou'll see that I can actually go in and\n\n843\n00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:49.950\nI can do a data carve,\nexport a word list, do all sorts of stuff.\n\n844\n00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.410\nAnd so let me just show you one more.\n\n845\n00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.894\nOops, let me click here,\nshow you one more thing.\n\n846\n00:41:55.861 --> 00:42:00.067\nAnd so I'm I'm gonna highlight just so\nyou could see it before I do it, just so\n\n847\n00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:02.215\nyou see where I was talking about.\n\n848\n00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:04.839\nI'm gonna highlight this section\nwhere I can do a preliminary report.\n\n849\n00:42:04.839 --> 00:42:08.575\nI can go ahead and\nI can bring in internet keyword search, so\n\n850\n00:42:08.575 --> 00:42:10.761\nI can actually do a Keynet search.\n\n851\n00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:15.498\nI can also go in and do the data carving\nbut I'm gonna export a word list for\n\n852\n00:42:15.498 --> 00:42:18.149\nyou, and make sure that we can see that.\n\n853\n00:42:18.149 --> 00:42:19.200\nSpeaking of seeing things,\n\n854\n00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.665\nI know you're going to take a look\nat that item up in the chat there.\n\n855\n00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.460\nAll right, let's do that and\nlet's go here.\n\n856\n00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.170\nLet me just show you what a word list\nlooks like when I export this out.\n\n857\n00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.667\nSo I'm gonna call it ITProTVDemo.txt.\n\n858\n00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:35.940\nYou'll see that there.\n\n859\n00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.060\nAnd so we're gonna just go in and do that.\n\n860\n00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.328\nLet me just throw that out here in\nthe folder, we'll just go ahead and\n\n861\n00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:43.884\nexport that real quick.\n\n862\n00:42:43.884 --> 00:42:48.721\nAnd what the world list will let\nus do is essentially is gonna\n\n863\n00:42:48.721 --> 00:42:53.677\ngo through the index of the file,\nor the case folder rather.\n\n864\n00:42:53.677 --> 00:42:57.541\nIt's gonna find all in the evidence\nall the words that are unique,\n\n865\n00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:02.500\nwe're gonna put them in a file, a text\nfile, so it's gonna be a notepad file.\n\n866\n00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.290\nWe're then gonna be able to use that\nif we want to do password cracking for\n\n867\n00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.990\ninstance for other things and\nactually bring that information in and\n\n868\n00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.690\nbe able to import it to\ndo a variety of things.\n\n869\n00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.080\nBut also do keyword searching so\nit's gonna be helpful for us to do that.\n\n870\n00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.350\nThat files gonna be a little too big for\n\n871\n00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.740\nus to open up using Notepad,\njust here while we're doing the demo.\n\n872\n00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.500\nBut I'll at least show it to ya,\nI'll give you an idea what it looks like.\n\n873\n00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.120\nBut you can then use that file to\nactually drive keyword searching and\n\n874\n00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.550\nas I said most importantly doing password\ncracking if you want to do that.\n\n875\n00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.751\nWe're going to do an episode\nwhere we do password cracking.\n\n876\n00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:33.472\nYou can obviously take a look at that and\n\n877\n00:43:33.472 --> 00:43:35.360\nuse that as import\nmaterial if you need to.\n\n878\n00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.870\nSo let's wait for that to finish.\n\n879\n00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:37.490\nAlmost done.\n\n880\n00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.310\nAnd then as soon as it is I'll quickly\npop in and show how big it is and\n\n881\n00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:43.090\nwhere we'll find it.\n\n882\n00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:47.860\nSo we'll find that in the, there we go.\n\n883\n00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:56.260\nWe'll find that sitting over here in\nour IT PRO ADFTK folder for the case.\n\n884\n00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.820\nIn this case, the IT PRO one.\n\n885\n00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.870\nThere's our access database\nthat we just looked at.\n\n886\n00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.570\nAnd there is our ITProTV.txt file.\n\n887\n00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.310\nLet's just zoom in so you can see that.\n\n888\n00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.665\nThat's our word list that we just\nwent ahead and brought together.\n\n889\n00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:13.799\nYou can see roughly it's about 72 megs or\nso in size, so it's a fairly big file.\n\n890\n00:44:13.799 --> 00:44:17.040\nThere's a lot going on in there so I just\nwanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n891\n00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.700\nThese are also all the other files and\ncreators part of the actual case file.\n\n892\n00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.610\nAll right so let's get out of there, let's\nget out of there and the other thing I\n\n893\n00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:31.360\nwanna show just as we warp up the demo is,\nhey, we saved the file, the report,\n\n894\n00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.760\nwe closed it we did that last time but\nwe didn't back it up.\n\n895\n00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.279\nJust wanna show you about\ngood case maintenance.\n\n896\n00:44:35.279 --> 00:44:37.641\nSo when we're done with this,\nlet's say we made some changes.\n\n897\n00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:42.163\nI'm gonna come in and go to File and\nI'll highlight it before we do it so\n\n898\n00:44:42.163 --> 00:44:43.170\nyou can see it.\n\n899\n00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.900\nWe've got the ability there to\ndo a backup of the case file.\n\n900\n00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.480\nBacking up the case file allows\nus to be able to go in and\n\n901\n00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.820\nhave a duplicate of the case file in\ncase something goes wrong, right?\n\n902\n00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.769\nLogically this makes a lot of sense.\n\n903\n00:44:54.769 --> 00:44:56.710\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n904\n00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.530\nLet's just click here.\n\n905\n00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.730\nGet rid of that.\n\n906\n00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.010\nAnd so let's go here,\nlet's do a backup on the case.\n\n907\n00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.780\nPrompts us, and says, hey,\n\n908\n00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.850\ndo you wanna back this up,\nwhere do you wanna back it up?\n\n909\n00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.500\nSo we have to specify a path,\ngive it a name.\n\n910\n00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.170\nSo that's pretty straightforward, right?\n\n911\n00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:15.311\nSo we'll do that, click OK.\n\n912\n00:45:15.311 --> 00:45:18.942\nYou could see it's backing up, it's,\nwhat, about just over a gigabyte,\n\n913\n00:45:18.942 --> 00:45:21.840\nabout a gig and\na half approximately in size, right?\n\n914\n00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.060\nAnd so it's going to finish that up.\n\n915\n00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.800\nGive that a minute or two.\n\n916\n00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.250\nAnd then as soon as that's done we've\ngot a nice little back-up file so\n\n917\n00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.900\nif anything were to go wrong,\nthe case becomes compromised.\n\n918\n00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.631\nIt's corrupted, who knows what.\n\n919\n00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:35.113\n&gt;&gt; It's not the end of the world.\n\n920\n00:45:35.113 --> 00:45:36.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n921\n00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.450\nWe actually have it and\nwe can obviously, then, can go back and\n\n922\n00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:39.800\nrestore it if need be.\n\n923\n00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.690\nSo this has been\na run-through on the tool.\n\n924\n00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.570\nNow, just as we wrap up, I did mention,\nhey, you should go out to the web.\n\n925\n00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.100\nYou should probably take a look at some\nof the newer versions of the tool and\n\n926\n00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:49.640\nthe materials.\n\n927\n00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.408\nSo I wanna show you where\nyou can go to do that.\n\n928\n00:45:51.408 --> 00:45:56.929\nACCESSDATA's website, right at\naccessdata.com and you'll see here\n\n929\n00:45:56.929 --> 00:46:02.710\nthat I'm just on the property rather\non the solutions or offering area.\n\n930\n00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.830\nI've just gone in and gone under\nDigital Forensics, Forensics Toolkit.\n\n931\n00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.390\nThey do have other products by the way but\n\n932\n00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.130\nwe're just looking at\nthe Forensics Toolkit so you can see that.\n\n933\n00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.366\nThere's information here about it.\n\n934\n00:46:11.366 --> 00:46:13.520\nThey have a nice little overview video.\n\n935\n00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.248\nIt's only a couple of minutes.\nYou probably don't necessarily\n\n936\n00:46:15.248 --> 00:46:16.570\nneed to go through that one.\n\n937\n00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.492\nBut what you do wanna do\nif you're interested,\n\n938\n00:46:18.492 --> 00:46:20.568\nis there's a little link\noff to the right here now.\n\n939\n00:46:20.568 --> 00:46:24.030\nCan we go full-screen for a second just so\nyou can see the link I'm pointing to?\n\n940\n00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:29.840\nThis may obviously, right down there, this\nmay change by the time you go see this.\n\n941\n00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.370\nMaybe they reorganize the webpage.\n\n942\n00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.030\nMaybe it's not there anymore, who knows?\n\n943\n00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.900\nBut my point is, if it is or just look\naround for they have a YouTube channel\n\n944\n00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:41.300\nthat they actually maintain where they got\ntheir videos and stuff outside on YouTube.\n\n945\n00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.950\nThey've got a bunch of videos,\nhow to's things like that.\n\n946\n00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.470\nProbably want to just go take a look,\nlearn a little bit more about the product,\n\n947\n00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.865\nlearn a little bit more about how\nto install it, play around with it,\n\n948\n00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:55.020\nthey got some white papers, you could see\nsome features here about things it does.\n\n949\n00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.100\nIt's a pretty cool little set of products,\nand\n\n950\n00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.460\nit's definitely worth your\ntime to go take a look at.\n\n951\n00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.210\nSo it's a great tool, definitely encourage\nyou to think about going out and\n\n952\n00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.300\ntaking a look at it.\n\n953\n00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.172\nWanna invite you to come on back and\nsee us for\n\n954\n00:47:05.172 --> 00:47:07.004\nanother episode in the same kinda format.\n\n955\n00:47:07.004 --> 00:47:11.812\nBut we're gonna preview another major tool\nthat is used by the majority of forensics\n\n956\n00:47:11.812 --> 00:47:15.090\ninvestigators, this one is\ngonna be called In Case.\n\n957\n00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.498\nIn case you have not seen this one.\n\n958\n00:47:16.498 --> 00:47:21.131\nIt will be very valuable set of thought\nprocesses for you to take a look at as\n\n959\n00:47:21.131 --> 00:47:26.420\nwell, between access data FDK and\ntheses are the two major tool set.\n\n960\n00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.885\nThat are used by the majority\nof investigators worldwide.\n\n961\n00:47:28.885 --> 00:47:32.191\n&gt;&gt; Well the access data people have\ndefiantly done a fine job of putting\n\n962\n00:47:32.191 --> 00:47:34.980\ntogether their FTK,\nit is an amazing piece of software.\n\n963\n00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.258\nAnd something like Adam was saying\nas one of the heavy hitters tn\n\n964\n00:47:39.258 --> 00:47:40.800\nthe forensics world.\n\n965\n00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.370\nSo if you get into that business, you'll\nprobably be using if not their software,\n\n966\n00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.380\nsomething very similar,\n\n967\n00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:50.520\nwe're gonna take a look at one of the\nother heavy hitters in that area as well.\n\n968\n00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.981\nThat being said,\nas a really cool demonstration,\n\n969\n00:47:52.981 --> 00:47:56.473\nwe love seeing how things work,\ngetting to walk through software that we\n\n970\n00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:59.585\ntypically wouldn't have access to or\neven know about.\n\n971\n00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.943\nYou've done a fantastic\njob that we appreciate it.\n\n972\n00:48:00.943 --> 00:48:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n973\n00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.570\n&gt;&gt; But, It is time, that time again.\n\n974\n00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.020\nThat's right ladies and gentlemen,\ntime for us to sign off.\n\n975\n00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.450\nI bid you a fun farewell from ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n976\n00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.529\n&gt;&gt; I am the access data FTK guy.\n\n977\n00:48:14.529 --> 00:48:16.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n978\n00:48:16.052 --> 00:48:17.713\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n979\n00:48:17.713 --> 00:48:24.204\n[MUSIC]\n\n980\n00:48:24.204 --> 00:48:26.753\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

of\nITProTV I'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n6\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.696\nand in today's episode well,\nIt's more on CHFI, and of course\n\n7\n00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.105\n&gt;&gt; Would it ever be anything else?\n\n8\n00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, we do but just not today.\n\n9\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Not recently.\n\n10\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.315\n&gt;&gt; And you hear the voice\nemanating from around me.\n\n11\n00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:29.865\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:33.340\nLike an angel descending from heaven,\nholding one long note.\n\n13\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is our good friend Mr.\n\n14\n00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:35.775\nAdam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:37.005\nAdam, welcome to the show sir.\n\n16\n00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.055\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, thanks.\n\n17\n00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:40.055\nAlways good to be here and\nspend time with you and\n\n18\n00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:44.925\nall of you kind folk that\nmake up our ITProTV audience.\n\n19\n00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:47.605\nSo we're gonna continue our\nconversations around CHFI.\n\n20\n00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.881\nWe did in our last episode,\nencourage you to watch it by the way,\n\n21\n00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:52.897\nif you have not seen it before this one.\n\n22\n00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:55.928\nNot that you have to watch these\ntwo in any particular order,\n\n23\n00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:58.090\neither one in either order will work.\n\n24\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.730\nBut both of them together\nare very important.\n\n25\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.090\nThe last episode we took a look\nat a tool called Access Data FTK,\n\n26\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.340\none of the two main\ninformation management,\n\n27\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.670\ncase management tools sets that forensic\ninvestigators will use to set up their\n\n28\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.560\nthoughts, provide case documentation,\nas we went through, took a look at.\n\n29\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.370\nAnd pretty good detail.\n\n30\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.310\nHow to set up a case,\nhow to provide evidence, bring it in,\n\n31\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.210\nmanage it, investigate it.\n\n32\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.260\nAnd also put it together at the end,\n\n33\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.050\nas Daniel had prompted us\nto take a look at and do.\n\n34\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.290\nAnd actually create a report, and show\nyou how to export that information and\n\n35\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.340\npresent it, potentially if you\nhave to be an expert witness.\n\n36\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.030\nAnd Dan is going to be doing that\nlater today, he's goinna go over and\n\n37\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.790\ntestify on all the stuff we found on his\nmachine and answer some very uncomfortable\n\n38\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.240\nquestions as to why he had\nthose things where they were.\n\n39\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.180\n&gt;&gt; I plead the fifth, your honor.\n\n40\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.340\n&gt;&gt; Cuban cigars, Daniel,\nwhat were you thinking?\n\n41\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.910\nThose things are illegal,\nat least they were until recently.\n\n42\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.060\nAnyway, but you would have seen\nif you went through that episode,\n\n43\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.560\namong the other things we did.\n\n44\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.160\nWe found pictures of a variety of sources,\ndocuments,\n\n45\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.940\nall sorts of stuff that we've set up.\n\n46\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.412\nThis episode is gonna do essentially\nthe same thing but with a different tool.\n\n47\n00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:09.560\nWe're gonna take a look at in case,\nanother major case management tool,\n\n48\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.320\nthat many investigators we use,\na lot of you may already be familiar with.\n\n49\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.480\nIf you're not, you're gonna get\na chance to see how it works,\n\n50\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.120\ntake a little tour under the hood.\n\n51\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760\nJust like we talked about with Access FTK,\nwe're gonna do a demo\n\n52\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.140\non an older version of the tool\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n53\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.830\nThe vendors today are not putting out\nproduct demos the way they used to.\n\n54\n00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.850\nDan and I were talking about this offline,\nbetween our episodes.\n\n55\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.114\nYou have the fact that these days\nbecause of the functionality and\n\n56\n00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:37.940\nfeatures of the tools and a lot of\ntimes as I mentioned, with Access FTK.\n\n57\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.255\nBecause they are connected to the cloud\nmore often than not these days,\n\n58\n00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.016\nthese tools are not demoed in\nthe same way they used to be, so\n\n59\n00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:48.010\nwe're gonna show you a version of the tool\nthat you certainly can work with.\n\n60\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.050\nBut the newest version of the tools\nare available to you online.\n\n61\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.120\nWe'll show you how to go\nto the vendor website.\n\n62\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.060\nTake a look at that.\n\n63\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.060\nBut they offer online demos, essentially.\n\n64\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.470\nThey offer premade videos,\n\n65\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.430\nwhich will definitely encourage you\nto think about taking a look at,\n\n66\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.290\nand watching to see the most recent\nversions of the tools, the capabilities,\n\n67\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.540\nthe features, as you think about not only\nmaybe looking to ultimately use the tool.\n\n68\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.250\nBut If you're gonna prepare for\nthe CHFI exam, wanna know a little bit\n\n69\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.370\nmore about the tool, how it works,\nwhat the functionality is,\n\n70\n00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.900\nalways good to be up to date\non some of those new features.\n\n71\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.320\nAnd we'd think about, make you\na recommendation, have you do that.\n\n72\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.780\nAnd I'll show you the website as part of\nthe demo and show you where to go and\n\n73\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.580\ntake a look to find that information.\n\n74\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.717\nSo as we often do, let us-\n&gt;&gt; Commence.\n\n75\n00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Commence, alrighty.\n\n76\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.720\nSo, let me take a look at the tool.\n\n77\n00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.926\nWe'll see, now let me just zoom\nin as we did last time just so\n\n78\n00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.430\nyou could see it's kind of set up.\n\n79\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.550\nWe've got our end case\nevaluation running here.\n\n80\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.240\nGot a case already set up,\nloaded up some information.\n\n81\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.720\nPut some stuff in there.\n\n82\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.230\nAnd we're just gonna go ahead and take\na look at some hard drives, some data and\n\n83\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.350\nthings like that,\nthat we can find in there.\n\n84\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.991\nSo, just like with the Access FTK, we're\ngonna go in, we're gonna take a look,\n\n85\n00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:59.924\nwe can open up, save, and, or\ncreate information in here.\n\n86\n00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:04.093\nWe could add a device, add raw images, so\nyou'll notice we can go in and add, or\n\n87\n00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:07.410\nmount a hard drive,\nbring in an image file, things like that.\n\n88\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.540\nSo we have the same kind of capabilities.\n\n89\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.480\nWhere we go to do it and\nhow we do it maybe slightly different, but\n\n90\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.600\nessentially the same kind of idea.\n\n91\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.710\nAnd so I brought in a partition as you\ncan see here, let me just open this up.\n\n92\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.159\nI've got the C drive, and\nthe D drive loaded up here.\n\n93\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.710\nSo we can see some hard drive\ninformation on a typical partition.\n\n94\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.640\nWe can drill down,\nsee information about it.\n\n95\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.600\nWhen we highlight the C drive and zoom in,\n\n96\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.750\nwhat we'll see is highlighted\nthat down at the bottom here,\n\n97\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.610\nwe could see information about it,\nsee where it came from, what it is.\n\n98\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.960\nThis is just some sample data that\nis created and used with this.\n\n99\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.750\nAnd we can see under the file directory,\nor\n\n100\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.850\nlisting of the names here\noff to the right hand side.\n\n101\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.130\nWhen I highlight the drive, the various\nfiles that make up the partition.\n\n102\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.730\nWe can see MFT, MFT Mirror,\nlogfile, attribute, dev, bitmap.\n\n103\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.340\nThese should look familiar to you,\nby the way.\n\n104\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.820\nWe did our hard drive and\nfile system discussion.\n\n105\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.910\nThose were gonna be the same files\nwe talked about making up a typical\n\n106\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.120\nNTFS partition.\n\n107\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.700\nAnd we went through,\n\n108\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.950\ntalked about what they are, talked about\ntheir importance, so we could see them.\n\n109\n00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.190\nAnd just by looking at this, we should be\nable to tell that this is an NTFS drive.\n\n110\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.290\nSo we can tell that just by looking.\n\n111\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.480\nWe've got some additional\nstuff down there.\n\n112\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.220\nGot a little Windows temp file,\ngot some image files and\n\n113\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.720\nvarious things sitting down there.\n\n114\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.037\nWe've got information about description,\nwhat they are,\n\n115\n00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:33.799\ninternal hidden system files.\n\n116\n00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:38.402\nWe've got an archive, deletion\ninformation, got a last access timestamp,\n\n117\n00:05:38.402 --> 00:05:41.833\nlet's just scroll over here\nkind of see what else we have.\n\n118\n00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:45.188\nWe have a file creation last right entry\n\n119\n00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:49.570\nmodification The file causation date and\ntime.\n\n120\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.335\nWe've got size information, physical size,\nextent in terms were it is on the drive,\n\n121\n00:05:56.335 --> 00:06:01.355\nand the actual mapping with the sectors\nand the information associated with it.\n\n122\n00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:05.781\nWe would also have hash values\nin case we needed any of that.\n\n123\n00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.910\nWe would have information about the full\npath as to where this actually is found.\n\n124\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.170\nAnd as we go over and\nsee, have short names,\n\n125\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.940\nsymbolic link, is it internal,\nis it a duplicate, is it overwritten.\n\n126\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.910\nAnd a very large amount of attributes and\n\n127\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.570\nproperties associated with\nthis data as we bring it in.\n\n128\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.980\nIt's very, very detailed information.\n\n129\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.310\nAnd if we go over and highlight,\n\n130\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.760\nlet's say hypothetically,\nthe MFT and we take a look at it,\n\n131\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.850\nwe'll just right click on it and zoom\nin so you could see what we get there.\n\n132\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.190\nWe could copy it, we could export it.\n\n133\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.380\nWe could use bookmarking.\n\n134\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.320\nWe talked about bookmarking\nin the other show we did for\n\n135\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.050\nAccess FTK where we could go in and\nwe could create a bookmark and\n\n136\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.430\nthen report that out and\nthen highlight that in our report.\n\n137\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.520\nSo we could do that.\n\n138\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.740\nWe could look at file signatures, we can\nmanipulate and modify the column headers.\n\n139\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.970\nShowed you about 30 columns that\nare there, we have some other options.\n\n140\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.100\nWe can go to the parent so\n\n141\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.990\nwe can actually go up hierarchically,\ntake a look at a file level up or down.\n\n142\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.320\nSo we've got a lot of detailed items that\nwe can interact with here and work with.\n\n143\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.461\nSo we can do that.\n\n144\n00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:12.102\nNow if I double-click on the item as\nI just did, you could see this file\n\n145\n00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:16.520\nwhatever it is, in this case the MFT\nfile has whatever extension.\n\n146\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.832\nIt says, hey, it has something, but\nit's not gonna have the correct signature\n\n147\n00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:22.576\nof the file type, do you wanna view it or\nview it anyway, yes or no?\n\n148\n00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:26.295\nMeaning, I may be able to go in and\nget information about the file, but\n\n149\n00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:28.490\nit depends on the nature of the file.\n\n150\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.600\nThese hidden files, you're probably\nnot gonna be able to go in and\n\n151\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.060\ntake a look at directly without\nsome sort of special viewer or\n\n152\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.950\nsome sort of conversion filter, right.\n\n153\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.210\nBut in general, I may be able to do that.\n\n154\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.570\nSo I can see some information about\nit if I scroll down, by the way.\n\n155\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.658\nAnd I look kinda down here.\n\n156\n00:07:44.658 --> 00:07:48.020\nLet me just show you what I'm doing and\ntake a look.\n\n157\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.158\nJust down here,\nI went down a little too far, so\n\n158\n00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.263\nbear with me here half a second\nwhile I scroll back up.\n\n159\n00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:57.551\nBut what I can find is down at the bottom\nwhen I highlight the MFT, under the Report\n\n160\n00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:01.600\ninformation, I can actually see\na very large amount of information.\n\n161\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.581\nAbout it.\nI can see the actual information,\n\n162\n00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:04.290\nthe full path.\n\n163\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.494\nI can also see information about who has\nrights on the machine that I got this from\n\n164\n00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:15.330\nto see this so I've got permission and SID\nand GUID information for individual users.\n\n165\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.770\nWe've taken a look at S-1-5-18 before.\n\n166\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.520\nThat's one of the system accounts\nbuilt in to a Windows machine.\n\n167\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.210\nWe've played around with some\nof those in prior episodes and\n\n168\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.000\ntaken a look at them and mapped those\nusers back to other data items.\n\n169\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.690\nSo we could see that.\n\n170\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.545\nWe'll see that that's\nan administrative user there.\n\n171\n00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:35.260\nAnd we can see here we\nhave this administrator.\n\n172\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.120\nThe ID is gonna be S-1-5-32 on that one,\nso we can see that.\n\n173\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.960\nAnd they have permission there.\n\n174\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.590\nSo we see a bunch of different stuff and\nwe can see the sequence ID and\n\n175\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.280\njust some other information about this.\n\n176\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.860\nSo it shows us information about\nwho has rights to the file and\n\n177\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.120\ninformation about what\nmay be going on there.\n\n178\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.458\nWe can take a look at and\n\n179\n00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:58.690\njust view different aspects of this\nas we look at anyone of these items.\n\n180\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.444\nAnd so we can go in, we can take a look,\nand we can drill down.\n\n181\n00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:07.703\nWe can go in, I'm just clicking on\nthe movie over here as you can see on\n\n182\n00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:10.931\nthe Extend folder, and\nI can drill through the directions and\n\n183\n00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:15.114\nsee what's inside the folder by looking\nat information off to the right there.\n\n184\n00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:18.866\nWe'll see we have some repose points and\nsome quota information about the quota\n\n185\n00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:22.010\ntable to actually see,\nhey what are the storage quotas for users?\n\n186\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.330\nThat kind of thing.\n\n187\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.921\nSystem volume information,\nI can actually drill through there.\n\n188\n00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:30.468\nI could see the tracking log,\nso I can actually go in and\n\n189\n00:09:30.468 --> 00:09:33.720\nyou'll see information\nabout the tracking log.\n\n190\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.320\nAnd I can scroll down and see information\nabout it, see who has rights to it,\n\n191\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.550\nwho's been interacting with it.\n\n192\n00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.520\nYou could see that scrolling down below.\n\n193\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.090\nSo I can do that.\n\n194\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.580\nLooks like I have a restore\nitem of some kind here.\n\n195\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.320\nAnd so, I can go in and\nsee the restore point.\n\n196\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.420\nSo I have at least one\nrestore point on the system.\n\n197\n00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.620\nSo we can see that and\n\n198\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.180\nI can see the change log around\nthe restore point as well.\n\n199\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.480\nSo I can actually drill it in and\nsee that information off the C drive.\n\n200\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.410\nRemember, this is coming from\nan NTFS partition, right,\n\n201\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.520\njust a standard test partition that's\nbeen created to work with the tool.\n\n202\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.330\nSo I have those capabilities and\nI can kinda drill in.\n\n203\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.500\nOn the D drive, I can go in and\nlook at information there.\n\n204\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.350\nWe'll kind of preview that and\nshow you what that looks like.\n\n205\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.050\nOn the D drive,\nlittle bit different information.\n\n206\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.960\nLooks like I have some\nFAT partitions there.\n\n207\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.040\nWe can see those set up\na little bit separate and\n\n208\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.290\ndifferent than what\nthe NTFS stuff looked like.\n\n209\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.120\nSo we can tell immediately by looking,\n\n210\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.580\nthis is a FAT partition\nas opposed to NTFS.\n\n211\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.230\nWe've got some .tmp files,\nvolume information, again,\n\n212\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.210\ninformation that may be of interest to us.\n\n213\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.975\nLooks like we've identified volume slack,\nand unallocated clusters, excuse me.\n\n214\n00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:42.360\nSo we can scroll across, see some\ninformation on that, we don't have to go\n\n215\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.345\nall the way over to see everything,\nbut you get the general idea.\n\n216\n00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:49.041\nWe can still go in and take a look at\nwhat's there, and so if I look at for\n\n217\n00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:53.429\ninstance Unallocated Clusters, and I just\ndo this a little bit, bring this up, so\n\n218\n00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:56.620\nwe could see a little bit\nmore of what's on the bottom.\n\n219\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.610\nIf I start to just investigate down there\nand highlight Unallocated Clusters and\n\n220\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.580\nlook down at the report information,\nI can see the size, initial, and\n\n221\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.190\nactual of the drive.\n\n222\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.310\nI could see the Starting Extent,\nso the location where I start.\n\n223\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.560\nI could see the number of extents,\n\n224\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.640\nthe actual size of the partition, physical\nsize, number of sectors, what it is, and\n\n225\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.050\nI can tell a lot about\nthe geometry of the drive.\n\n226\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.810\nI can actually investigate all the stuff\nwe've talked about in prior episodes,\n\n227\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.900\nwhere I can see what's happening in there.\n\n228\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.560\nI can actually see the information, and\n\n229\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.760\nessentially the map,\nthe layout of the drive.\n\n230\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.000\nSo it's gonna help me to understand\nthe information I'm looking for and\n\n231\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.070\nwhere it may be located, which is gonna be\nvery valuable to me as an investigator.\n\n232\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.180\nWe can scroll down and\n\n233\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.160\nobviously find additional\ninformation about that as we go.\n\n234\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.930\nWe may go in.\n\n235\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.110\nAnd let's just see if there's anything\nin any of these .tmp directories.\n\n236\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.980\nThere may or may not be.\n\n237\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.750\nIt obviously depends.\n\n238\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.410\nLooks like we may have some\ninformation referenced there, but\n\n239\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.870\nnothing specific on any\nof the .tmp directories,\n\n240\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.042\nprobably the most important item\nwould be just being able to look at.\n\n241\n00:11:58.042 --> 00:12:02.130\nYou have the volume information,\nthe primary and secondary FAT partitions,\n\n242\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.200\nthe sizes associated\nwith things like that.\n\n243\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.570\nSo we can go in, we can certainly\ndrill through that information.\n\n244\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.790\nNow on any of these, let's just go in and\ntake a look at the View menu real quick.\n\n245\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.240\nJust highlighting some information,\nkind of seeing what's there.\n\n246\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.470\nSo we can View, right, with any of\nthese items, selected File Signatures,\n\n247\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.320\nFile Types, Access Viewers, Hash Sets.\n\n248\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.690\nWe can do Keyword searches like we did\nin the other tool we took a look at.\n\n249\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.850\nWe can set up and\nlabel sub tabs for cases, so\n\n250\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.890\nwe can add different evidence types in.\n\n251\n00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.030\nWe could change the view, look at filters.\n\n252\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.530\nWe can move back and forth here,\n\n253\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.570\nvarious things that we normally\nwould want to be able to do.\n\n254\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.030\nAnd then under Tools,\ndepending on what we're doing,\n\n255\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.040\nwe've got an ability to do a search,\nso again there's an index running.\n\n256\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.550\nWe could do a full indexed search and\nlook at words.\n\n257\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.770\nWe could do a drive wipe,\nnot that we would normally wanna do that.\n\n258\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.260\nBut we do have the ability\nto forensically examine but\n\n259\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.780\nalso forensically remove information.\n\n260\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.180\nVerify evidence files, create boot disc,\nexcuse me, Mount as a network client,\n\n261\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.110\nso we can share the information out over\nthe network, maybe give it access to it.\n\n262\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.500\nWe can look at options and\n\n263\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.760\nprogram in how the capabilities\nof the tool may be set up.\n\n264\n00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.750\nIt's probably a good idea just for\nus to preview those options here for\n\n265\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.200\njust a minute.\n\n266\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.980\nGo in and zoom so\nyou can see what the tabs look like.\n\n267\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.080\nYou can see we have case options,\nthat's pretty straightforward,\n\n268\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.910\nthat's just our standard stuff that\nwe are taking a look at there.\n\n269\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.060\nWe can go in and we can go and\ntake a look at Global.\n\n270\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.814\nSo, we have Global options here, right?\n\n271\n00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.696\nSo, we can see Auto Save,\nBackup Files, right,\n\n272\n00:13:37.696 --> 00:13:41.960\nthat kinda stuff, Enable Picture Viewer,\nall the stuff we wanna do.\n\n273\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.220\nWe have a Debug area, we have Colors,\nFonts, so we can take a look at how we\n\n274\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.080\npresent information,\nthings like that, Storage Path,\n\n275\n00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.550\nwhere are we gonna store stuff, what's the\nDebug information gonna look like, right,\n\n276\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.830\nour Network Authentication Service,\nif we're gonna go ahead and\n\n277\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.480\nuse a network tool to\nbe able to generate and\n\n278\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.435\nauthenticate users and\nthen give them a key, we can set that up.\n\n279\n00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:07.430\nSo, Colors and Fonts for different things.\n\n280\n00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.630\nWe can take a look at different\ninformation and items about line numbers.\n\n281\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.570\nThis is really just more look and\nfeel kind of stuff, right?\n\n282\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.490\nKind of quality of life, how we present\ninformation more often than not.\n\n283\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:25.400\nBut we can go in, we can take a look\nat the Storage Paths here as well.\n\n284\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.420\nKind of see those,\n\n285\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.020\nsee what those are, and just see\nwhere everything is gonna be set up.\n\n286\n00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.450\nSo we can modify the settings\non the tool if necessary.\n\n287\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.410\nSo we can see all of that.\n\n288\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.840\nWhen we go in, let's just go in and\ntake a look at some e-mail files.\n\n289\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.330\nWe do have the ability here to be able\nto go in, let's say, and drill down, and\n\n290\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.130\nwe can go in and take a look at.\n\n291\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.840\nIf we do have email, we can go in and\nif we define that, we have a PST.\n\n292\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.600\nYou could see there we have one mounted.\n\n293\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.264\nWe could drill into the mailbox and\nlook at what's in the mailbox,\n\n294\n00:14:56.264 --> 00:14:57.280\npull e-mails out.\n\n295\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.920\nThere's our DAT file for\nsome of the extended data.\n\n296\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.030\nSo we can go in.\n\n297\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.070\nWe can actually preview that, take a look\nat that and see what maybe in there.\n\n298\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.330\nAnd then we could export\nthat if we wanted to.\n\n299\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.510\nSo let's see, we grab that,\nwe do an export.\n\n300\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.560\nYou'll see we have some information\nabout the fields that are there.\n\n301\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.300\nWhat do we wanna see,\nhow do we export that?\n\n302\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.810\nXML Formatted, where are we gonna do that?\n\n303\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.500\nWhat's the Output File gonna be called?\n\n304\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.920\nSo let's go ahead and let's just do that.\n\n305\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.620\nLet's do a little XML format.\n\n306\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.595\nWe'll do it as an XML instead of\na TXT just cuz we're crazy like that.\n\n307\n00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.320\nAnd you never know, right?\n\n308\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.247\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll select certain things.\n\n309\n00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:36.644\nIt would be nice.\nThe only thing I don't like is that it\n\n310\n00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:40.240\nwould be nice if we could do a Select All\nhere, if they just had a way for\n\n311\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.117\nus to check one.\n\n312\n00:15:41.117 --> 00:15:42.077\n&gt;&gt; A special button.\n\n313\n00:15:42.077 --> 00:15:42.878\n&gt;&gt; That is, right?\n\n314\n00:15:42.878 --> 00:15:47.290\nInstead of us having to go down, right,\nand essentially do all this stuff.\n\n315\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.148\nJust cuz I wanna show you\nwhatever fields may be imported.\n\n316\n00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:52.765\n&gt;&gt; And the good news is that\nslider is quite extensive.\n\n317\n00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:54.418\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n318\n00:15:54.418 --> 00:15:55.792\nWe're only halfway through and yet\n\n319\n00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:58.275\nhere we are five minutes later\nstill working on things, right?\n\n320\n00:15:58.275 --> 00:16:02.845\nSo the only thing I don't like about\nthe earlier versions of the tool with this\n\n321\n00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:04.476\nis there was no Select All.\n\n322\n00:16:04.476 --> 00:16:06.306\nThat was really-\n&gt;&gt; That was an oversight.\n\n323\n00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:07.901\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a bit of a bummer.\n\n324\n00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:12.832\nNow Not that you would necessarily\nwant to export everyone of these\n\n325\n00:16:12.832 --> 00:16:14.690\nfields into the report.\n\n326\n00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.440\nBut there may be times when\nyou want to and just as a hey,\n\n327\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.320\nwouldn't it have been nice if.\n\n328\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.280\nI'm just saying, I wasn't at that meeting.\n\n329\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.280\nHad I been sitting there,\nhad they asked me.\n\n330\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.830\nMy hand would have been the first\none to go up and say yeah,\n\n331\n00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.860\nyou do need to put that button in on top.\n\n332\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.250\nThat let's like every other vendor in the\nworld, that let's us select everything.\n\n333\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.970\nThat would be a good thing for\nyou to do right?\n\n334\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.600\nAll right, so we're going to put\nthis thing out on the desktop.\n\n335\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.380\nJust so we can find it because otherwise,\nwe're never going to be able to go\n\n336\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.050\nlook for it.,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n337\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.380\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just do that.\n\n338\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.850\nLet's just export that out, right?\n\n339\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.300\nAnd so when we do that, and\nwe get our XML, there it is right there.\n\n340\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.950\nWe'll just bring it over here and so,\nwe can go ahead and open that puppy up.\n\n341\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.240\nWhat do you think we should\nuse to open that up with?\n\n342\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.195\nShould we use info path,\nbecause that's overkill?\n\n343\n00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n344\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.780\n&gt;&gt; How about if we use\nthe Office XML Handler,\n\n345\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.500\notherwise known as Internet Explorer.\n\n346\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.420\nI don't know why they\njust don't call it IE.\n\n347\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.630\nThat's exactly what it is, right?\n\n348\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.180\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not like awesome.\n\n349\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.450\n&gt;&gt; No, I guess, I guess not, right?\n\n350\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.490\nSo when you export everything out\nin XML or any kind format text,\n\n351\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.520\nobviously, whatever.\n\n352\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.720\nUse the appropriate editor.\n\n353\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.290\nNow, we're not really getting much here.\n\n354\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.490\nThis is really just to show\nyou what would happen.\n\n355\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.690\nThe kind of data you would get.\n\n356\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.570\nHow it would be set up.\n\n357\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:21.230\nThe reality is,\n\n358\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.520\nyou'd have to have real data in the file\nfor you to get anything of substance.\n\n359\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.490\nThat email file is really got\nnothing in it to speak of.\n\n360\n00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.130\nBut what you do see is,\nthat we do get the basic information.\n\n361\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.340\nThe size,\nif there is a hash associated with it.\n\n362\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.860\nAll the different information\nwould come out here and\n\n363\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.320\nwe would be able to see the file name and\nthe unique information about it.\n\n364\n00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.429\nAnd we'll just zoom in so\nyou can see one of those.\n\n365\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.130\nBut you see EXTENDED.DAT\nand/or MAILBOX.PST.\n\n366\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.160\nAnd we can see general information about\nit and how it ultimately is exported.\n\n367\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.320\nSo we could grab that information\nif we wanted to, bring that out and\n\n368\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.980\nwork with that.\n\n369\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.254\nIf we had to take that file out\nseparately, maybe present it or\n\n370\n00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:01.101\ndo something with it.\n\n371\n00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:05.187\nWe can easily do that, as you can see, so\nwe could go in, we could work with that.\n\n372\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.830\nIf we do go into identities,\nwe do have unique identifier up in there.\n\n373\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.160\nWe can scroll down, right.\n\n374\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.520\nBuilding as we go.\n\n375\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.260\nOutlook Express, right,\ngot all sorts of stuff in there and\n\n376\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.260\nyou can see there's just a bunch\nof files that get set up.\n\n377\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.540\nWe've got Hotmail, deleted items.\n\n378\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.020\nWe've got contacts.\n\n379\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.050\nWe've got journals, MSN, etc.\n\n380\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:34.086\nSo, we've got all that stuff and\nwe can actually go in and\n\n381\n00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:38.130\nand we can go and\ntake a look something like this, right.\n\n382\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.990\nThis is a new as GUI for\nthe project message.\n\n383\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.700\nLooks like it's some sort\nof an email items, so\n\n384\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.420\nwe can just go in and draw down and\ntake a look at wherever the file is.\n\n385\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.360\nAnd we may then be able to obviously\nas you could see, preview the file.\n\n386\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.560\nSee if there is any information in there\nthat may be important to a epsilon, right.\n\n387\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.370\nAnd we can take a look and\nstart just reading through.\n\n388\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.410\nAs we begin to see what's in there and\n\n389\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:04.310\nwe can see here under files and\nfile items kinda what's in there.\n\n390\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.060\nWe can take a look and\nsee what's going on.\n\n391\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.340\nJust scroll through and\nsee what may be in there.\n\n392\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.080\nSo we do have the capabilities to\ninteract with some of that as well.\n\n393\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.060\nSo, when we take a look at\nbuilding this kind of a case file\n\n394\n00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.520\nwe're actually able to interact with.\n\n395\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.670\nAnd see again, email, pictures,\n\n396\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.720\nany of the kind of stuff we would\nnormally see in access FTK.\n\n397\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.670\nWe can see here as well, bring it in,\nand interact with it, examine it,\n\n398\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.130\ncreate that information.\n\n399\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.880\nWork with it.\nSave it off and ultimately then,\n\n400\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.090\ncreate the case or create\nthe the presentation of the evidence.\n\n401\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:41.020\nWhen we're done and we're finishing\nup right, we'll come in here.\n\n402\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.950\nWe'll go to File.\n\n403\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.690\nWe'll do a save or save as, right.\n\n404\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.430\nOr save all,\njust depending on what we're doing.\n\n405\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.590\nWe can actually print information off.\n\n406\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.440\nSo, let's just go in.\n\n407\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.570\nI don't think I've modified anything,\nbut let's just do a aave as just, so\n\n408\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.050\nwe can show this to you.\n\n409\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.870\nThe file type extension for\na tool like this,\n\n410\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.120\nor end case, is going to be a .Case file.\n\n411\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.660\nSo, you can see it there and\n\n412\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.710\nyou can see we have to create\nsomething with a .Case extension.\n\n413\n00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.830\nTo be able to create the file and\nbring it back in.\n\n414\n00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.100\nSo, we could call ous Case 1 or\nwhatever we want to call it, but\n\n415\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.820\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n416\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.350\nWe'll just stir this up on the desktop.\n\n417\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.290\nI already have a case file there.\n\n418\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.136\nAs you can see.\n\n419\n00:20:16.136 --> 00:20:16.821\nCase 1.Case.\n\n420\n00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:17.630\nVery small.\n\n421\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.590\nNot too big, so we'll just go ahead and\n\n422\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.290\nwe'll do case two, just so\nwe can create another file.\n\n423\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:24.840\nHit Save.\n\n424\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.150\nDoesn't take very long at all.\n\n425\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.950\nThere's our case two\nfile right over there.\n\n426\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.170\nWe can see it right there\nright next to our export.xml.\n\n427\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.040\nNo bigger, probably, than our first file,\nbecause we haven't made any changes to it.\n\n428\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.690\nYeah, it's almost 38K.\n\n429\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.510\nIt's the same size and so, we can just\ntake that and then, bring that in and\n\n430\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.780\nimport that into the machine.\n\n431\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.960\nOr rather, into a machine where\nwe're running the tool and\n\n432\n00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.370\nwe'd be able to view that case file.\n\n433\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:55.050\nSo if we were, let's say, to close out\nthe case and we wanted to open it.\n\n434\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.810\nAll we need to do is simply go to open and\njust pull it in the case file and\n\n435\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.620\nthen, just reload it.\n\n436\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.800\nAnd then, we will be able to\njust bring the case back up and\n\n437\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.050\nto do whatever we need to do with it.\n\n438\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.450\nNow, in the demo version of the product\nwe are working with here,.wW\n\n439\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.790\ndon't have full capability, so\nI can't add a drive image say, right.\n\n440\n00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.470\nThe tool is going to be manipulated by\nthe vendor in such a way that only certain\n\n441\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.430\nthings will work.\n\n442\n00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.040\nI was explaining to Daniel that the older\neval version that we're working with.\n\n443\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.760\nThe demo version when\nthey did give it out,\n\n444\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.330\nwould only work with pre-made case files.\n\n445\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.200\nThat they would provide you as sample\nevidence to show you the highlighted\n\n446\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.460\nfeatures of the tool.\n\n447\n00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.480\nSo, you may not be able to get full access\nto the functions of some of the tools when\n\n448\n00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.260\nyou demo them.\n\n449\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.360\nBut you could certainly go in and\ntake a look.\n\n450\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.660\nWe can go in and\nplay around with the features.\n\n451\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.540\nGet a general sense of\nwhat's happening in there.\n\n452\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.960\nBut if you want to look at what\nEnCase is capable of doing today.\n\n453\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.780\nIf you go out to the EnCase website,\nso guidancesoftware,\n\n454\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.940\nall one word, guidancesoftware.com.\n\n455\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.390\nAnd you'll see when you go there,\nthey have a products and services there.\n\n456\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.430\nNow, they have a lot of software,\na lot of products.\n\n457\n00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.420\nSo what you're going to want to do is,\ngo up under Products and Services.\n\n458\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.920\nAnd you'll see under Software right there,\nthat they have endpoint security,\n\n459\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.310\nrisk manager, etc.\n\n460\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.800\nWe want to EnCase Forensics.\n\n461\n00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.050\nThat's the tool that we're\nessentially demoing and looking at,\n\n462\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.220\nthat's what it's called now.\n\n463\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.080\nEnCase Forensic and\nyou can go in and take a look.\n\n464\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.970\nThey also have Tableau Hardware.\n\n465\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.510\nThe Tableau Hardware is actually\na write blocker solution.\n\n466\n00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.610\nThat allows you to actually through\na hardware device be able to go out,\n\n467\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.590\nattach a hardware system.\n\n468\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.520\nThat will allow you to do forensic\nduplication off the source system.\n\n469\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.240\nBut to do so on a forensic, we found\nway with right blocking capabilities,\n\n470\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.400\nso you can get that from them as well.\n\n471\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.890\nYou see Forensic Duplicators there,\nPassword Recovery,\n\n472\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:34.970\na lot of different things.\n\n473\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.020\nBut we clicked on En case forensics and\n\n474\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.210\nwe've gone in and you can see that as I\nmentioned there is a demo capability.\n\n475\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.160\nNow the thing with this one,\n\n476\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.600\nwhen we go this a little bit\ndifferent than some of the others.\n\n477\n00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.130\nThey have their videos and\nall their stuff online and their videos,\n\n478\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.910\ntheir demos are actually really nice,\nprofessionally done, very cool.\n\n479\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.030\nYou just have to register.\n\n480\n00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.554\nThey don't try sell to you anything.\n\n481\n00:22:56.554 --> 00:22:58.870\nThey're not going to sell\nyour information, but\n\n482\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.990\nthey do ask you to register\nto be able to see.\n\n483\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.780\nSo put information in and submit and then,\nyou're actually able to watch a series of\n\n484\n00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.990\nvideos about the product and\nhow it is set up.\n\n485\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.770\nSo you may want to do\nthat on a newer version.\n\n486\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.430\nJust again, to get a look at it.\n\n487\n00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.200\nGet a sense of what it looks like, right.\n\n488\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.230\nYou can see some information about it.\n\n489\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.330\nInternal investigation,\nhow they use it, things like that, so\n\n490\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.290\nit's actually an interesting little thing.\n\n491\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.420\nThey've also got some other webinars\nthere that may be of interest to you,\n\n492\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.800\nso just a good idea for\nyou to take a look.\n\n493\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.670\nAnd again,\ndepending on when you're watching this.\n\n494\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.330\nThis may not be the most recent version of\nthe product by the time you go to look.\n\n495\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.190\nIt could be something\nnewer than version 8 or\n\n496\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.620\nwhatever was just up there that\nhad been released recently.\n\n497\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.990\nI think it was version eight,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n498\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.955\nIf you see a version nine or\nten, by the time you go there.\n\n499\n00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:44.290\n[LAUGH] Obviously, this was a shot\na little bit before you're taking a look.\n\n500\n00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.370\nBut you can see information\nabout the product.\n\n501\n00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.310\nHow it works.\n\n502\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.940\nThe thought process behind it.\n\n503\n00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.026\nGives you a little sample of what the,\n\n504\n00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:55.370\na tour a little taste of\nwhat the tool can do.\n\n505\n00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.760\nso, just some information for\nyou somethings to have you think about,\n\n506\n00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.110\nhave you be aware of as you\nlook at the tool as well.\n\n507\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Another very, very cool tool, Right?\n\n508\n00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.584\nWe've already saw the, what was it?\n\n509\n00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:07.320\nThe Access data SDK.\n\n510\n00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.440\nThis one also another heavy hitter\nin the arena of forensics And\n\n511\n00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.540\nevidence gathering and management systems.\n\n512\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.900\nVery, very nice things for us to be\nable to keep everything organized.\n\n513\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.875\nWe like to do that.\n\n514\n00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:23.500\nBecause especially when you're working\nwith files, tons of files on hard drives.\n\n515\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.950\nYou don't want to start getting,\nwhere did that go?\n\n516\n00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.840\nWhat was that?\n\n517\n00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:33.230\nThis helps keep everything in a nice\nmanaged centralized area and in order.\n\n518\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.790\nThat you can more easily\nmanipulate those things.\n\n519\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.790\nAdam you did a masterful job of\nshowing us how to use the thing and\n\n520\n00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.570\nwhat it can actually do for us.\n\n521\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.488\nWe appreciate that, but\nit's that time again everyone.\n\n522\n00:24:43.488 --> 00:24:47.230\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off for\ntoday, or for this show anyway.\n\n523\n00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.070\nFor ITPro TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowery.\n\n524\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n525\n00:24:51.040 -->

Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.746\nAdam, welcome back,\nhow's it going again today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I just had something in my eye.\n\n13\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.210\nIt's going well, thank you, and\n\n14\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.680\nprobably a good place to start\ntalking about steganography.\n\n15\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.810\nIf you can't see straight, you\nobviously can't see what's in an image.\n\n16\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.370\nAnd what we're about to talk about is a\nway that you can actually manipulate data,\n\n17\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.800\nmanipulate an image, we call it the\ncontainer, and hide stuff inside of it.\n\n18\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.520\nIt's almost like taking a box,\nlet's say hypothetically.\n\n19\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.280\nPutting, normally,\na certain amount of stuff in the box.\n\n20\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.640\nAnd maybe we put a list on the outside\nthat tells us what's in the box.\n\n21\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.650\nSo we have a good sense of what's there.\n\n22\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.780\nBut if we fool people that are looking at\nthe list, if we don't put everything down.\n\n23\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.090\nOr maybe we stick in some extra stuff and\nwe write down a description, but\n\n24\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880\nit's not what we put in the box.\n\n25\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.310\nWe could, in theory,\nopen the box and be surprised.\n\n26\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.120\nAnd this is the general\nidea behind steganography.\n\n27\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.990\nThe idea of using a technique, a sound\nmathematical technique to be precise.\n\n28\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.770\nBit manipulation is really what we do,\n\n29\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.545\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsee how we can manipulate the bits\n\n30\n00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.620\nin a variety of different ways\ndepending on the container involved.\n\n31\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.550\nWe could do audio steganography,\nvideo steganography, file steganography,\n\n32\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.470\nimage steganography,\nthe list goes on and on.\n\n33\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.580\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\n\n34\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.770\nI thought we'd start off with a demo, just\nto show you the general idea behind this.\n\n35\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.278\nActually found an online website where\nwe can do this instead of having you\n\n36\n00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:37.890\ndownload a tool.\n\n37\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.430\nYou could certainly go out and\ndo that as well.\n\n38\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.170\nBut we're gonna take a look at just\nan online tool that you can use easily.\n\n39\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.320\nYou could follow right along,\nactually, if you wanted to, and\n\n40\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.028\nsee the demonstration in real time.\n\n41\n00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:51.830\nSo if we go to our machine, I'm just\ngonna bring up our website here, what\n\n42\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.740\nwe can see is an online site, there are\nmany of them by the way that you can find.\n\n43\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.505\nAll I did was literally go out and\nGoogle tools for steganography online and\n\n44\n00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:02.011\nI came across a list of sites.\n\n45\n00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:05.229\nI just happened to choose one of the ones\nthat looked like it would be promising,\n\n46\n00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.500\nand we're gonna do a little demo for\nyou with it.\n\n47\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.441\nSo the tool itself, or\nthe website itself, manytools.org.\n\n48\n00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.470\nAnd they have a little section there\non hacking tools and steganography.\n\n49\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.300\nProbably see that off to the side\nhere if we just go in, so\n\n50\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.830\nyou could see where we are.\n\n51\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.220\nAnd you could see right up\nthere what the URL looks like.\n\n52\n00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.820\nSo\nmanytools.org/hacker-tools/steganography.\n\n53\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.410\nAnd you're able to then go in and\nactually access this area.\n\n54\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.345\nAnd so once we do that, got just a little\nbit of a control panel down below here\n\n55\n00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:37.544\nwith a little demonstration area, explains\nmore or less what you're gonna do.\n\n56\n00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:41.295\nYou're gonna create a little hidden text,\nwhatever you wanna put into your image.\n\n57\n00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:45.084\nYou're then gonna go ahead and specify\nan image, either that you wanna put\n\n58\n00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:48.445\nthe text into, or\nthat you wanna hide inside of another one.\n\n59\n00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:50.255\nI did the host image at the bottom.\n\n60\n00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.885\nSo what I did was, I created an image, or\n\n61\n00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:56.375\nI have an image on my machine, I'll show\nyou that in a minute, and I used it here.\n\n62\n00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.635\nI just told it where to go\nfind it off my machine.\n\n63\n00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:03.055\nI said put the message into the image,\nI was then able to download the image, so\n\n64\n00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:07.160\nit's been steganographically modified, and\nthen I was able to upload the image and\n\n65\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.110\ntranslate it back.\n\n66\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.752\nSo let's take a look, first of all,\nat what the target image is.\n\n67\n00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:15.925\nIts gonna be just this Windows\n8 logo that you could see here.\n\n68\n00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:18.240\nI just have it opened it up in Paint.\n\n69\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.153\nThere's nothing unusual about it,\nit's a white space image.\n\n70\n00:03:20.153 --> 00:03:24.400\nGot some blue text in there,\npretty basic and pretty common.\n\n71\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.088\nThere is a lot of what we call\nwhite space in this image,\n\n72\n00:03:27.088 --> 00:03:29.139\nessentially space we could hide data in.\n\n73\n00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.330\nThat is the one thing just to be aware of.\n\n74\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.210\nBut I could've done this\nwith any kind of image.\n\n75\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.900\nA photograph of somebody.\n\n76\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.788\nA page of text.\n\n77\n00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:37.730\nWouldn't really matter what it would be.\n\n78\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.060\nSo this is the normal image.\n\n79\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.230\nThe image essentially that we look at and\n\n80\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.730\ngo well there doesn't appear be\nanything unusual about that.\n\n81\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.480\nAnd there actually is not.\n\n82\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.600\nBut what we then can do is\nwe can upload this image.\n\n83\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.490\nSo we just go grab it, browse for\nit, save to code this image.\n\n84\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.710\nSo if I go browse, and go grab that image.\n\n85\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.840\nI'm gonna grab it from my downloads area,\nright there.\n\n86\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.640\nAnd I'm just gonna hit click decode, and\n\n87\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.610\nthen I'm gonna click this button and\nwhen I do that, what I'm gonna see,\n\n88\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.440\nI've already just done it so you could\nsee it without us having to wait for\n\n89\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.950\nit, is the message that I hid in\nthere is that test message from Adam.\n\n90\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.990\nEssentially I just snuck\nsome data into the image so\n\n91\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.230\nthat we can pretend that it wasn't there.\n\n92\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.530\nYou wouldn't see it, but I can actually\nsecret image, or secret data rather,\n\n93\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.620\ninto the image.\n\n94\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.995\nNow this is a very basic test, right,\nthis is really not very impactful.\n\n95\n00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:30.995\nBut from a steganographic investigation\nstandpoint, from a CHFI standpoint,\n\n96\n00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:34.085\nif I'm the investigator and\nI'm looking at image files,\n\n97\n00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:37.585\nI always have to have in the back of my\nmind, hey has that file been manipulated?\n\n98\n00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:39.255\nHas that file been modified?\n\n99\n00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:42.285\nIs there some sort of data\nthat may be hidden there?\n\n100\n00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:44.880\nAnd if there is how am I gonna know?\n\n101\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.210\nWe have tools that will let us do this,\nfor instance.\n\n102\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.760\nLet me show you a tool that will display,\nor\n\n103\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.080\ntell us, give us some indication that\nthere may be steganography going on.\n\n104\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.835\nThis tool, as you can see here,\na tool called StegSpy.\n\n105\n00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:57.980\nIt's a very simple tool.\n\n106\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.860\nInterface really isn't\nto complicated at all.\n\n107\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.459\nPretty simple here literally,\nall we do is choose a file, we hit run,\n\n108\n00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.729\nwe go browse for it, drop it in there, and\nthen we're gonna be able to see whether or\n\n109\n00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.845\nnot that file may have\nsteganographic properties, right.\n\n110\n00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:16.439\nSo gonna click run,\ngonna go go in, gonna grab a file.\n\n111\n00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.175\nLet me just scroll down here.\nI have a picture\n\n112\n00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:17.680\nfile that we're gonna use.\n\n113\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.140\nSo let me just go grab that.\n\n114\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.920\nThat's right there.\n\n115\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.562\nA little JPG file.\n\n116\n00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:28.890\nSam.jpg, right,\nreally nothing too crazy or complicated.\n\n117\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.710\nWe'll just do that, and then as soon as I\nlook at that and examine it, you could see\n\n118\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.170\nthere it says, hey, steganography found\nat certain marker at certain position.\n\n119\n00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.310\nIn other words, the program goes through,\nexamines the file,\n\n120\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.060\nin this case an image file, right.\n\n121\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.160\nReads the bits,\nwe're gonna show you what they look like,\n\n122\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.990\nwe'll open up a hex editor and\nactually take a look at it.\n\n123\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.130\nAnd you can see that it says hey,\n\n124\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.120\nthere looks like there's\nsomething in there that's unusual.\n\n125\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.080\nMay not know exactly what was done,\nthis tool doesn't tell us hey,\n\n126\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.940\nthis data's been secreted there.\n\n127\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.150\nOr hey, this data is actually\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n128\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.750\nIt's just a quick little validation tool.\n\n129\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.340\nIt says hey, there's probably\nsteganography associated with this file.\n\n130\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.400\nI would have to use other tools,\nas an investigator,\n\n131\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.580\nto go actually uncover what the data is.\n\n132\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.720\nBut this does tell me that I have\na target of interest, essentially.\n\n133\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.490\nA file that I may wanna\nfurther investigate.\n\n134\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.520\nVery simple tool.\n\n135\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Adam,\nI've done something similar to this,\n\n136\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.850\nI'm wondering if it falls under\nthis steganography umbrella.\n\n137\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.940\nWhere I've taken reverse shellcode, hidden\nit and basically put the information for\n\n138\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.675\na gif file at the beginning\nof my shellcode, and\n\n139\n00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:35.340\nuse a file uploader to put my shellcode\non the machine I was trying, and\n\n140\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.140\nthen a local file inclusion exploit\nto make that shellcode run.\n\n141\n00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.660\nIs that under the umbrella of\nsteganography where I'm saying\n\n142\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.380\nthis is actually a picture.\n\n143\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.460\nAnd I think it even will show\nup as one if I'm not mistaken.\n\n144\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.270\nBut your shellcode is in there and\nit will run that code.\n\n145\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, so as long as it's\nembedded in what we call the cover,\n\n146\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.900\nthe file itself, which in your case would\nhave been whatever the picture was, or\n\n147\n00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.890\nthe image was.\n\n148\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.090\nWhatever it was, as long as you embedded\nthat code, the shellcode, inside\n\n149\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.140\nthe picture, hiding it in some way so\nan average user would look at a picture,\n\n150\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.440\nnot see the shellcode, then that's a great\nexample of steganography, absolutely.\n\n151\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.830\nSo it would be a great way not\njust to examine steganography,\n\n152\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.540\nthe conceptual idea of what Daniel did\ndefinitely falls into the category.\n\n153\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.047\nBut we would also more commonly call that\nan exploit with regards to hacking, right.\n\n154\n00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.072\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:26.699\n&gt;&gt; So you would, in theory,\nbe writing shellcode that would allow you,\n\n156\n00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.881\nmost likely, to either create a command\nline of some kind with some sort of remote\n\n157\n00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:35.510\nmanagement capabilities, or, at a minimum,\nprobably injecting some sorta malware-\n\n158\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.253\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:38.308\n&gt;&gt; Or code, or whatever it\nwould have been that you wrote,\n\n160\n00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:40.320\ninto that shell that would allow you to,\nmost likely,\n\n161\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.340\ndo something on the machine, right,\nmost likely gain an advantage.\n\n162\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.424\nSo it would be an example of\nsteganography, but it would also be\n\n163\n00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.878\nsteganography used specifically to\nexploit the machine in some way.\n\n164\n00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.815\nSo it would be a hacking technique in\naddition to just being steganography.\n\n165\n00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:55.495\nWhich is something that's actually\nreally cool, very difficult to do.\n\n166\n00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.179\nSo Give Daniel credit for\nbeing able to do something like this.\n\n167\n00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.350\nIt's not easy to do.\n\n168\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.202\nBut it's also something we talk\nabout in CEH, among other classes,\n\n169\n00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:03.830\nin Certified Ethical Hacking.\n\n170\n00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.360\nSo it's a really cool way to use\nsteganography if you're up to no good.\n\n171\n00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.670\nOur goal would be to figure out\nif that image of Daniel has,\n\n172\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.340\ntheoretically in our example planted\non the desktop, has some sort of code.\n\n173\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.660\nIn this case, potentially bad code in it.\n\n174\n00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.460\nAnd try to find that image so\nwe could understand.\n\n175\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.460\nMaybe not before it happened.\n\n176\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.830\nBecause most likely, Daniel would\nhave exploited the machine by now.\n\n177\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.435\nLet's be honest,\nyou don't go to all that time and trouble.\n\n178\n00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:28.114\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To figure out you\n\n179\n00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:30.221\njust want to leave it sitting there,\nand not do anything about it.\n\n180\n00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:35.016\nBut what we would do coming in after\nthe fact would be to steganographically\n\n181\n00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:36.470\nexamine those files.\n\n182\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.440\nSay, hey, this image looks kinda weird.\n\n183\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.900\nAnd as a result,\n\n184\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.810\nmaybe there's something unusual like we\njust took a look at with that one tool.\n\n185\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.640\nWe would then have to go\nopen that file up and\n\n186\n00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.810\nactually better understand\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n187\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.930\nBut we could at least\nstart to examine them.\n\n188\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.010\nSo let's go back.\n\n189\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.510\nLet's take a look at potentially\none tool that will let us see\n\n190\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.210\nthe kind of files that\nDaniel was talking about.\n\n191\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.240\nDiscover that they are there,\nso to speak, after the fact.\n\n192\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.393\nThis is a toll called\nDigital Photo Recovery.\n\n193\n00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:04.600\nIt's one of many tools that\ncan be used to examine\n\n194\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.140\nvarious images of different\ntypes on a machine.\n\n195\n00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.600\nI run this against the C\npartition in a test machine,\n\n196\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.370\nso Windows Server 2008 R2, NTFS partition.\n\n197\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.670\nAnd all I did was fire the tool up,\nlet it run for a period of time.\n\n198\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.530\nJust a fair warning on this, I let it\nrun for probably three hours prior to\n\n199\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.344\nus coming on and doing the episode,\ndoing the demo to gather some data.\n\n200\n00:09:27.344 --> 00:09:29.207\nI'm up to something like 20,\n\n201\n00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:33.132\nalmost 22,000 images pulled\nout of the root of the drive.\n\n202\n00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:36.010\nWe were up to like a third of the drive\nby the time I just stopped it and said,\n\n203\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.425\nhey, probably enough to demo.\n\n204\n00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:38.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, this kind of a tool could\n\n205\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.720\ntake a long time to turn\nthrough an entire hard drive.\n\n206\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.190\nYou set it up, you run,\nyou kinda walk away, right?\n\n207\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.270\nYou do some other stuff and\nthen you come back to it at some point.\n\n208\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.170\nKeeping in mind the methodology, right?\n\n209\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.590\nWe're never running this against the live\ninformation on the system in real time.\n\n210\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.620\nWe're capturing, in other words, a bit\nstream copy, either forensically sound\n\n211\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.090\nthrough bit stream copies that go\nsource to, what I'm I thinking?\n\n212\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.440\nDisk to disk, right?\n\n213\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.770\nFrom source to target or\nwe're doing an image, one or the other.\n\n214\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.620\nSo maybe disk to disk copy or\ndisk from a source to an image.\n\n215\n00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.295\nAnd then mount that using a DD,\nlet's say, or an R drive,\n\n216\n00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:19.185\nwe talked about different\nways to create images.\n\n217\n00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.125\nPut together a cool little how to for\n\n218\n00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:24.495\nyou on DD that we're gonna include\nin the show notes somewhere, right?\n\n219\n00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:25.915\nWe'll have that available\nto you somewhere.\n\n220\n00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:29.172\nSo, just a little step through on how\nto use the tool we keep talking about,\n\n221\n00:10:29.172 --> 00:10:30.302\nhow to use DD.\n\n222\n00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:31.903\nSo, you can go in and create an image,\n\n223\n00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:33.815\nthere are several\ndifferent ways to do that.\n\n224\n00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.816\nBut we would run a tool like this or\nany of these tools, by the way,\n\n225\n00:10:36.816 --> 00:10:37.702\noffline, right?\n\n226\n00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:41.772\nThis is not volatile data, this is data\nthat's stored in the hard drive, so we're\n\n227\n00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:45.242\ngonna be able to grab this and examine it\noffline in a forensically sound manner.\n\n228\n00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:47.612\nJust reminding you of the fact\nthat that's the case.\n\n229\n00:10:47.612 --> 00:10:49.002\nBut I've got a bunch of images here,\n\n230\n00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:54.130\nI mean if I scroll through, there's 30\nclose to 22,000 images on this drive.\n\n231\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.930\nThere's images of all sorts of stuff.\n\n232\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.370\nThis will pull up images from programs.\n\n233\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.950\nThis will pull up images from web caches.\n\n234\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.620\nThis will pull up images that\nare sitting as image files, but\n\n235\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.020\na lot of these images came\nout of program install.\n\n236\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.680\nSo we've got executables on there that\nhave images packaged up with them.\n\n237\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.620\nThis tool is gonna rip those\nimages out and show them to us.\n\n238\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.270\nThis tool is gonna recover deleted images,\nso\n\n239\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.250\ntemp directories are gonna be looked at.\n\n240\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.910\nRegisters, caches,\nthe Recycle Bin, you name it.\n\n241\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.418\nWe're gonna get images from everywhere.\n\n242\n00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:27.190\nSo if you scroll through and just kinda\nlook at some of the stuff we've uncovered\n\n243\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.750\nhere, as they kinda render and\nwe just take a look at what they are.\n\n244\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.997\nThere's random images sitting up there\nfrom stuff that I don't recognize and\n\n245\n00:11:33.997 --> 00:11:35.040\nI'm not familiar with.\n\n246\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.640\nI don't know where they would\nhave come from on the machine.\n\n247\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.210\nSome of them are from websites, others\nare from programs, and things like that.\n\n248\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.470\nThere's one there something by,\npowered by Zap.com or something,\n\n249\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.970\nit's probably from a web cache, right?\n\n250\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.080\nFrom a site we went to.\n\n251\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.585\nThere's some Kitty cats there and\nsome other stuff,\n\n252\n00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.845\nsomebody kicking back on the beach,\nit looks like couple of people talking.\n\n253\n00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:55.585\nWho knows where those images came from?\n\n254\n00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:57.445\nBut they're somewhere in the machine.\n\n255\n00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.617\nAs an investigator,\nwe gotta know that, right?\n\n256\n00:11:59.617 --> 00:12:01.755\nWe wanna know, hey, that data is in there.\n\n257\n00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:02.815\nWe gotta understand it's there.\n\n258\n00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:06.795\nAnd these are not necessarily\nsteganographically modified images.\n\n259\n00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:11.290\nThese are simply images that are sitting\nin the drive that we would wanna recover.\n\n260\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.740\nWe'd have to do a subset search using\nother tools to be able to understand\n\n261\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.590\nwhich ones they fall into\nthe category like Daniel described,\n\n262\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.570\nwhere he's purposely manipulated one or\nmore images.\n\n263\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.400\nAnd he's then set out to try to trick us,\npotentially, to using it or\n\n264\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.097\nsomething like that.\n\n265\n00:12:26.097 --> 00:12:31.240\nWould your RAM in your example,\nwould your image have most\n\n266\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.230\nlikely been sitting somewhere we would\nhave to execute it to get the code to run?\n\n267\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.520\nOr would it actually have just\nauto executed at a certain time or\n\n268\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.240\nhow did you envision that exploit working?\n\n269\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.480\n&gt;&gt; That one specifically I was\nable to use a local file inclusion\n\n270\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.400\nvulnerability in the machine, to say,\n\n271\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.350\nhey, there's a file on your computer I\nwould like you to do something with it.\n\n272\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.230\nAnd it had the code inside of it which is\nbasically, here's what I want you to do,\n\n273\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.130\nI want you to extract that code and\nrun it.\n\n274\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.530\nAnd then I was able to do that and gain\na shell to that machine, that system root.\n\n275\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.930\n&gt;&gt; So someone had to execute that?\n\n276\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.840\nYou-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I executed through a web browser.\n\n277\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.600\n&gt;&gt; You executed through them.\n\n278\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.930\nSo you didn't phish them, you essentially\ngained control and executed directly.\n\n279\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.840\nBut you may have also phished them,\nsent them some sort of\n\n280\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.580\nan email if they clicked on the link,\ncould execute a death.\n\n281\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.670\nWe have a lot of ways to do that,\nin other words.\n\n282\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.870\nAnd so sometimes it's just that simple.\n\n283\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.966\nAs an investigator, we will be looking for\n\n284\n00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:20.538\ntell tell evidence to kind\nof unwrap what happened.\n\n285\n00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:23.685\nYou said you did through the web, through\na local vulnerability on a web server.\n\n286\n00:13:23.685 --> 00:13:25.334\nSo whenever you wanna bid through an API,\n\n287\n00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:28.875\nwe'd have to examining the web directories\nto be able to figure that out, right?\n\n288\n00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:34.340\nSo we'd have to know that and maybe have\na sense of that to examine what that is.\n\n289\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.990\nBut looking at recovery, remember\nrecovery is one of the key aspects of\n\n290\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.300\nwhat we actually engage in with\nregards to forensic examination.\n\n291\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.290\nWe may or may not know the tool or rather\nthe photo and the image and the fact that\n\n292\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.755\nit's been steganographically,\ntripping over my tongue.\n\n293\n00:13:50.755 --> 00:13:52.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stenographically\n\n294\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.860\nmodified until we start to examine\nwhere those images come from.\n\n295\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.490\nAnd run them through some\nadditional filtering or\n\n296\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.460\nessentially sorting\ntools that can tell us.\n\n297\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.560\nSo digital recovery,\n\n298\n00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.430\nlike we were showing you, is one way to\nstart gathering a whole bunch of files,\n\n299\n00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.730\na whole bunch of images, and then to\nstart narrowing down what we can do.\n\n300\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.420\nThere's another interesting tool\nthat we can take a look at.\n\n301\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.550\nLet me just bring this one up so\nyou can see it here.\n\n302\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.380\nThis one is called\nthe Zero Assumption Recovery Tool.\n\n303\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.220\nIt's an interesting tool.\n\n304\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.390\nLet me just scroll in.\n\n305\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.431\nYou can see it's, again,\nit's just an easily found tool online for\n\n306\n00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:28.550\nyou to play with.\n\n307\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.020\nYou do get a demo capability, you do\nhave to license it to fully use it, so,\n\n308\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.740\nit's up to you.\n\n309\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.820\nBut for what we're gonna do,\njust take a quick look at some images and\n\n310\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.540\nbring them back.\n\n311\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.890\nIt's pretty straight forward,\nyou get that part for free.\n\n312\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.190\nNotice, by the way, one reason I like\nthis tool, you can do data recovery for\n\n313\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.140\nWindows analytics right\nfrom the same tool.\n\n314\n00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.259\nAnd you've got a RAID-based recovery\nsolution there as well which actually\n\n315\n00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:49.040\nallows us.\n\n316\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.970\nAnd we talked about RAID in one of our\nprior episodes in the hard drive and\n\n317\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.200\nfile systems episodes.\n\n318\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.310\nWe went through and talked about\ndifferent kinds of RAID solutions.\n\n319\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.940\nWould allow us to go into a RAID array and\nrecover data from there.\n\n320\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.010\nWhich, again, if we talked\nabout different RAID solutions,\n\n321\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.650\nsome being tolerant of failure,\nsome not being.\n\n322\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.230\nIf you had a strive set RAID level zero,\nthat it failed due to a hard drive\n\n323\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.270\nfailure, you may have to\ngo in to recover data.\n\n324\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.810\nAnd this tool would potentially allow\nyou to do that if you didn't have\n\n325\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.660\nthe backup for instance.\n\n326\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.610\nSo it's just one way to think about that.\n\n327\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.350\nBut it is kind of a nice tool.\n\n328\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:23.220\nSo if we do an item recovery here,\njust let it analyze the drives.\n\n329\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.160\nWe can go in, we get the ability\nhere to be able to go and\n\n330\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.390\nsee different hard drives.\n\n331\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:33.010\nRemember we do have our C and\nE drive rather, on the system.\n\n332\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.560\nOne NTFS, one FAT,\nwe're not gonna do the hey,\n\n333\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.355\nlet's go look at the NTFS thing again,\ncuz that's gonna take way too long.\n\n334\n00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I set this up\n\n335\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.670\nwith a bunch of pictures that I'd put\nonto the E drive, specifically so\n\n336\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.270\nwe could do a quick demo for you.\n\n337\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.085\nBut let's just take a look at what is and\nwhat is not sitting in E drive.\n\n338\n00:15:48.085 --> 00:15:51.226\nSo, in the E drive right now,\nI do have a pics directory.\n\n339\n00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:54.230\nAnd you, there are some pictures in\nthere,so we definitely do have just\n\n340\n00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.950\na mirror copy of some of the pictures\nwe've been using for demos.\n\n341\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.088\nBut I've deleted some\npictures out of there.\n\n342\n00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:00.937\nSo, not all of the pictures are there.\n\n343\n00:16:00.937 --> 00:16:03.510\nI've put them into, I've deleted\nthem rather and take them out.\n\n344\n00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.342\nSo, we can go through, and what we'll do\nis we'll be able to go in, grab that,\n\n345\n00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:12.200\nwe'll highlight that,\nwe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n346\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.360\nIt's gonna start scanning.\n\n347\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.000\nAnd it actually goes through,\nlooks at the volume map,\n\n348\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.540\nmaps out everything there,\ngives you a little color code.\n\n349\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.490\nSays hey, bad sectors, data fragments,\nwe've talked about these.\n\n350\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.000\nFile system structure,\nnothing of interest, right,\n\n351\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.320\nit's almost like playing Battleship,\nright?\n\n352\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So it goes through,\nnow it's already done that.\n\n353\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.140\nI zoomed in, so it froze for a second.\n\n354\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.230\nLooks like it found\na bunch of pictures there.\n\n355\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.360\nNow you'll notice that with this tool what\nit does not do, which is just something\n\n356\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.260\nfor us to be aware of, it finds the\npictures but it numbers them sequentially.\n\n357\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.860\nIt doesn't pull the file\nnames the way we had.\n\n358\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.363\nSo, you're now gonna have to go and\nlook at those pictures,\n\n359\n00:16:48.363 --> 00:16:51.505\nfigure out where they are or were,\nthey're not gonna be named the same thing\n\n360\n00:16:51.505 --> 00:16:54.719\nthey were when they were sitting on the\ndrive the way I just showed them to you.\n\n361\n00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:57.903\nSo, there's a little bit of a disconnect\nhere because as an investigator I now\n\n362\n00:16:57.903 --> 00:17:01.229\ngotta go look at this picture, go, okay,\nI don't' know what it was called, but\n\n363\n00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.840\nI know that, in theory, it's there.\n\n364\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.590\nNow there is metadata associated\nwith the pictures, remember?\n\n365\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.780\nAnd I can probably pull the metadata and\nget the original file name, so\n\n366\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.840\nI may still be able to reconstruct that,\nbut\n\n367\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.160\nI may have to do that with\nmore than one tool, right?\n\n368\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.320\nAs I randomly switch between [LAUGH]\nprograms while we're talking.\n\n369\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.853\nSo just keep in mind that, with a tool\nlike this, when I pull that back up I may\n\n370\n00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:24.312\nnot necessarily get a one to one match\nwith the original list of the files.\n\n371\n00:17:24.312 --> 00:17:27.016\nI may have to do a little more digging in\nother words, right, to understand that.\n\n372\n00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:30.929\nBut I've got this so I can select, and\nthis tool does have a select all unlike\n\n373\n00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:34.169\nthe other tool that we looked at\nwhere we had to actually go in and\n\n374\n00:17:34.169 --> 00:17:35.660\nclick through one at a time.\n\n375\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.840\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that.\n\n376\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n377\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.610\nthe other nice thing about this, I can go\nin and filter over here off to the right.\n\n378\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.918\nI can specify a certain date range before\nand after a minimum size, so I can zero\n\n379\n00:17:46.918 --> 00:17:50.853\nin on certain files of a certain type\nand/or a certain creation range.\n\n380\n00:17:50.853 --> 00:17:53.301\nCuz you know, a lot of times\nwe're filtering and looking for\n\n381\n00:17:53.301 --> 00:17:56.995\nstuff done during a certain period of time\nwhen we're forensically examining data.\n\n382\n00:17:56.995 --> 00:17:59.320\nBecause we don't want\nthe history of the machine,\n\n383\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.860\nwe want the history of the machine\nduring the attack period,\n\n384\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.260\nduring the period where the bad actor\nwas acting, maybe three, four days, or\n\n385\n00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.020\nwhatever it was, before and after the\ntheoretical date we think it happened on.\n\n386\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.810\nSo maybe it's a one or two-week window.\n\n387\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.270\nWouldn't it be great if we could\njust filter out all the other data?\n\n388\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.330\nAnd a tool like this, and\n\n389\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.830\nmany of the tools that we use,\ndo have these capabilities.\n\n390\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.700\nWe could filter them and\nwe can eliminate those files, that\n\n391\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.340\njust don't really make a lot of sense cuz\nthey're not within the creation windows.\n\n392\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.960\nSo that's just a nice little added\nfeature, so we're just gonna grab those,\n\n393\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.790\nclick next.\n\n394\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.260\nWe gotta specify where to put them.\n\n395\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.730\nI have a little demo folder\nalready set up called the FF Test.\n\n396\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.660\nSo, I'm gonna just go ahead and\ndo this there, but\n\n397\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.200\nI'm gonna show you what's already there,\njust so you know.\n\n398\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.790\nSo let me go in there and grab that.\n\n399\n00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.750\nAnd where did I put that?\n\n400\n00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.690\nLet's get it right here.\n\n401\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.982\nGo to E drive, and, on E, we'll go in, and\n\n402\n00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:52.820\nlet's I did it on C rather that's why.\n\n403\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.080\nNo wonder why I couldn't find it.\n\n404\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.910\nThere it is, so in the fs test,\nI have a root directory there.\n\n405\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.180\nLet's just create a separate\ndirectory to put this into.\n\n406\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.950\nWe'll call this Adam so we know that we're\nputting it into an empty directory, right,\n\n407\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.670\nso we know there's nothing\nthere ahead of time.\n\n408\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.320\nSo let's just do that,\nlet's just do Adam and then, or\n\n409\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.520\nrather add Adam to the directory.\n\n410\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.177\nOn existing files, we could do auto\nrename, right, we could overwrite, skip,\n\n411\n00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:18.030\netc or if some files are already\nthere we have that option.\n\n412\n00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.920\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nstart copying selected files.\n\n413\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.670\nNow we actually can have\nsome control over copy here.\n\n414\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.886\nWe can drop bad sectors, forget about\nthem if we hit a snag on the drive, so\n\n415\n00:19:28.886 --> 00:19:30.453\nonly copy in the good data.\n\n416\n00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:33.816\nWe could control the maximum disk\ncache size and how quickly this goes,\n\n417\n00:19:33.816 --> 00:19:37.510\nthis just speeds up the tool, these\nare just your performance indicators.\n\n418\n00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do this,\nby the way all this, is free,\n\n419\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.720\nI don't have license\nthis part of the tool,\n\n420\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.420\nit's when we get into the other stuff that\nit becomes a little more complicated.\n\n421\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.650\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that, it's copy,\npretty straight forward, pretty quick.\n\n422\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.570\nYou can see it's just copying files there.\n\n423\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.960\nIt's almost done by\nthe time we zoom back out.\n\n424\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.830\nAnd when we finish let's just\ngo right in here, gonna get\n\n425\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.100\na little root folder in there and\nour image files are starting to appear.\n\n426\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.760\nYou can see them all right there,\nlisted numerically,\n\n427\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.440\njust like they were sequenced in the tool.\n\n428\n00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.890\nSo we went ahead, we did all that and\nthen the tool just kinda resets itself.\n\n429\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.400\nAnd so if we take a look at what we got,\n\n430\n00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.440\nwe'll see in here that, randomly let's\njust choose one of these, open it up.\n\n431\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.450\nIt doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n432\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.580\nGot a little picture of some phones there.\n\n433\n00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:30.590\nThis one, my famous picture of\nCohiba Cigars that we've seen in some\n\n434\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.010\nof the other episodes, right?\n\n435\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.890\nSo, we got different things, a little\ncaution sign, you're random pictures\n\n436\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.180\nthat I just took and threw in there,\nit doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n437\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.560\nBut the point is that I can either see\nthat these picture have been deleted or\n\n438\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.530\nrecovered and I'd be able to pull\nthem back and start looking at them.\n\n439\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.300\nI could then take these pictures,\n\n440\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.270\nrun them through some stag in a graphic\ntools that detect steganography.\n\n441\n00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.100\nAnd I will be able to tell if\nthey've been modified or not.\n\n442\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.580\nSo it's a multi-step process when we mess\naround with these kinds of pictures and\n\n443\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.390\nwe start working with these kinds of\nimages because we'll first recover,\n\n444\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.960\nthen we'll have to examine, and\n\n445\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.310\nthen we'll have to drill in to see\nexactly what the modifications may be.\n\n446\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.170\nSo multiple steps in the process as we go.\n\n447\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.640\nLet's get rid of this tool.\n\n448\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.210\nAnd then lets look at one\nmore take on how this works.\n\n449\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.066\nAnd open up another tour called the hex\nworkshop and what the hex workshop does,\n\n450\n00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:20.365\nit's a hex editor.\n\n451\n00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:23.870\nAnd a lot of times the tools\nthat we're gonna use and\n\n452\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.000\nthe files we're gonna look at are gonna\ntell us that there's been some sort\n\n453\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.638\nof modification but you don't really\nknow how the modification takes place.\n\n454\n00:21:30.638 --> 00:21:33.996\nWhat I wanna show you is how\neasy it is to modify a folder or\n\n455\n00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:36.854\nrather excuse me an image or\na file in a folder and\n\n456\n00:21:36.854 --> 00:21:40.512\nhow easy it is to actually\nchange the underlying structure.\n\n457\n00:21:40.512 --> 00:21:43.730\nBut to do so in a way that we could easily\nrecover from if we know what we did.\n\n458\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.100\nSo let's take a look at a file.\n\n459\n00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.950\nBefore I actually open it up,\nlet's take a look at something right here.\n\n460\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.150\nI just showed you this a minute ago,\n\n461\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.940\nthis was the cohiba.jpg that\nI have that I recovered.\n\n462\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.280\nThis is a separate copy sitting on the\ndesktop, not the one we just recovered.\n\n463\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.960\nBut it's, we all agree, a picture of\nthree Cuban cigars sitting on top of\n\n464\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.490\na cigar box, nothing unusual about that.\n\n465\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.740\nI have another copy of that\nsitting right here, right there.\n\n466\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.260\nIt's not an image file, at least it\ndoesn't appear to be an image file.\n\n467\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.070\nIt doesn't have the jpg extension.\n\n468\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.970\nBut that's just because it's been renamed.\n\n469\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.970\nBut it's sitting right there and when I\nopen that up, if I open it up with Paint,\n\n470\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.981\nsure enough it opens up and\nthat's the identical picture.\n\n471\n00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:23.968\nAnd we could see the name of\nthat picture right on the top so\n\n472\n00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:26.850\nwe know it's the modified\nfile that I just showed you.\n\n473\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.460\nAll we did was simply\nchange the file extension.\n\n474\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.080\nThat's all we did.\n\n475\n00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.832\nNow that's not how we modify.\n\n476\n00:22:31.832 --> 00:22:33.835\nWhat I wanna show you is the following.\n\n477\n00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:36.969\nI have another version of that\npicture sitting right up here.\n\n478\n00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.240\nCohebaM, right there.\n\n479\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.300\nThat is also a modified file.\n\n480\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.140\nWhen I go to open that, in theory if it\nwas modified the right way just like I did\n\n481\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.570\nwith the first one, I should be able\nto open that with Paint as well.\n\n482\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.016\nBut when I go do that, I get this.\n\n483\n00:22:52.728 --> 00:22:55.309\nThis file is not a valid bitmap or\nwhatever it may be,\n\n484\n00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:56.550\nin this case it's a jpg.\n\n485\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.440\nIt doesn't really matter,\nit's not currently supported.\n\n486\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.120\nNow it's actually a perfectly\nvalid image file, but\n\n487\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.470\nwhat I did is I went in using the hex edit\ntool, I'm gonna show you how I did this.\n\n488\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.000\nAnd I modified the first\nseveral bits inside\n\n489\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.600\nthe actual image itself in the header.\n\n490\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.700\nAnd by doing that I essentially\nrendered the file unreadable.\n\n491\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.950\nBut the file is perfectly fine and\nall we'll have to do is fix what I did and\n\n492\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.930\nI can reconstitute\nthe data with no trouble.\n\n493\n00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.230\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nlittle bit editing in here.\n\n494\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.470\nThat's essentially what we gonna do,\n\n495\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.240\nlet's open Hex editor up,\nlet's take a look at what we did.\n\n496\n00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.670\nSo let me just open this up real quick and\nI we'll just go here to the desktop and\n\n497\n00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.190\nlet's just go back here down right there.\n\n498\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:39.580\nAnd let's open up the Coheba M one image,\nthe one that could\n\n499\n00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.380\nactually be open that is legitimate first\njust so we could show you what we did.\n\n500\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.397\nAnd what I did was,\nI am now looking at the hex code and\n\n501\n00:23:46.397 --> 00:23:50.992\nI'm just gonna highlight some of that\ncode right there while we're talking and\n\n502\n00:23:50.992 --> 00:23:53.339\nwe 're gonna zoom in so you can see that.\n\n503\n00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:55.737\nI know it's dark,\nit's a little bit hard to see the bits.\n\n504\n00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:59.716\nWhat I did is I modified that\nstring of code right there.\n\n505\n00:23:59.716 --> 00:24:05.287\nThose items, right, FFD8FFE00010,\nthose are the first sets of\n\n506\n00:24:05.287 --> 00:24:11.000\nbits in the header that actually\nhelp us to identify the file type.\n\n507\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.190\nAnd so, if I just monkey\naround with that a little bit,\n\n508\n00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.090\nI just change couple of values,\nI've essentially told the system,\n\n509\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.720\nbased on the instructions embedded in\nthe code of the file, that it doesn't have\n\n510\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.012\nan understanding of how to open it,\nbecause it doesn't know what it is.\n\n511\n00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:26.420\nNow, it's a very simplistic tool,\na very, rather, excuse me,\n\n512\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.570\na very simplistic trick.\n\n513\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.680\nVery complicated tool.\n\n514\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.130\nBut a very simplistic trick.\n\n515\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.490\nBut it's also highly effective if you\ndon't know what you're looking at, and\n\n516\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.110\nyou don't have the knowledge, right,\nthe investigative knowledge in your head,\n\n517\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.841\nto go and look at the file,\nlook at the header, and\n\n518\n00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:44.795\nthen look just to the left\nof the bits that I modified.\n\n519\n00:24:44.795 --> 00:24:49.605\nAnd if you look at what I just\nhighlighted, the next series of bits\n\n520\n00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:54.070\nright there, four sets of bits,\n4A, 46, 49, 46.\n\n521\n00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.860\nThat tells us the file type, excuse me.\n\n522\n00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.410\nJFIF, that is a jpg file,\nthat's the traditional\n\n523\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.170\nfile extension we would see in\nthe header to tell us it's a .jpg file.\n\n524\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.650\nBut if you don't know to go in and\nexamine the file, and\n\n525\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.010\ndon't look at it, you wouldn't see it, you\nwouldn't realize it, you wouldn't know.\n\n526\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.420\nNow, remember, this is the good file.\n\n527\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.640\nThis is the file that I can\nactually open up, right?\n\n528\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.820\nThis one works.\n\n529\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.630\nLet's take a look at what it\nlooks like when it's modified.\n\n530\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.770\nNow, what I'm gonna do is the following.\n\n531\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.440\nJust before we do that,\ngive me just a second.\n\n532\n00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.460\nLet me just do a notepad\ncapture here real quick.\n\n533\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.230\nWhat we're gonna do is just copy\ndown the bits that are good, just so\n\n534\n00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.310\nyou can see what they where.\n\n535\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.650\nJust put the caps lock on, or\ntake it off as the case my be.\n\n536\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.139\nAll right, there we go.\n\n537\n00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:40.880\nFF, D8, FF, E0, and 00,\n\n538\n00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.873\nand 1,0, okay?\n\n539\n00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:45.430\nSo, that's from, we'll just tag that m1,\njust so we can keep track of that, right?\n\n540\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.276\nWe'll make that a little bigger so\n\n541\n00:25:50.276 --> 00:25:55.798\nthat you guys can see that, probably.\n\n542\n00:25:55.798 --> 00:25:56.739\nAnd a little bit easier to see, okay?\n\n543\n00:25:56.739 --> 00:25:58.801\nSo we just have a sense of what we did,\nall right?\n\n544\n00:25:58.801 --> 00:26:02.580\nSo were we gonna do now is we're gonna go\nahead and just open up the other image.\n\n545\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.085\nLet's come down here.\n\n546\n00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:06.894\nAnd where is it?\n\n547\n00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:08.820\nThere is that one right there.\n\n548\n00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.916\nAnd were gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nstill see that JFIF is there, right,\n\n549\n00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:15.098\nbefore we do anything else, all right?\n\n550\n00:26:15.098 --> 00:26:18.047\nThat set of bits, right,\nso numbers 6, 7, 8, and\n\n551\n00:26:18.047 --> 00:26:22.110\n9 in that position is still there,\nit's still 4A, 46, 49, 46.\n\n552\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.310\nI didn't modify that, I could have, but\nI didn't do it for the demonstration.\n\n553\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.720\nBut in the real world,\nif I was modifying this file type,\n\n554\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.090\nI didn't want you know what it was,\nI was truly trying to manipulate it,\n\n555\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.970\nI would modify that so\nit wouldn't say JFIF there.\n\n556\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.520\nI would change it so that I knew,\nas the bad actor, what it was, but\n\n557\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.020\nyou would have a much\ntougher time figuring it out.\n\n558\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.309\nNow, there's a few other\nplaces I'd have to go and\n\n559\n00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:45.080\nmodify data to remove all evidence and\nall trace of the fact it's a JPEG file.\n\n560\n00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.344\nBut it would certainly be a pretty big\nstep forward just to do that in of\n\n561\n00:26:48.344 --> 00:26:49.710\nitself in the header.\n\n562\n00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.180\nBut let's take a look at\nwhat's actually sitting there.\n\n563\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.032\nAnd let's take a look at the bits\nthat are just off there, right.\n\n564\n00:26:56.032 --> 00:26:57.378\nZero through 5.\n\n565\n00:26:57.378 --> 00:27:01.090\nAA, BE, 9F, 12, 00, 1A.\n\n566\n00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.680\nNow, I don't even have to go look to tell\nyou that that's different than what I\n\n567\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.530\ncaptured, right?\n\n568\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.540\nWe know that for a fact.\n\n569\n00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.650\nBut let's actually just write them down,\nand\n\n570\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.170\nlet's just do a quick comparison just so\nwe can see.\n\n571\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:16.090\nSo what we'll see here is,\nwe'll do AA, BE,\n\n572\n00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:20.270\n9F, 12, and I believe that's 00.\n\n573\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.100\nOr no, I'm sorry, yeah, 00 and 1A, right?\n\n574\n00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.560\nI was looking one line down below.\n\n575\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.660\nAnd that is just from the file M.\n\n576\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.840\nNow, you could see there,\n\n577\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.930\njust doing a quick comparison, that\nthose bits are indeed different, right?\n\n578\n00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.999\nThey don't have to be radically different.\n\n579\n00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.790\nI did leave the zeros intact, 0000.\n\n580\n00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.820\nBut I did change others.\n\n581\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.796\nAnd by changing them, I changed the header\ninformation that doesn't allow the system\n\n582\n00:27:41.796 --> 00:27:43.440\nto understand how to open the file.\n\n583\n00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.830\nNow, if I put it back,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n584\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.150\nWell, let's go put that back, shall we?\n\n585\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.100\nSo, let's take a look.\n\n586\n00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.490\nLet's go here.\n\n587\n00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.580\nAnd what we gotta do is, you know what?\n\n588\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.302\nYou're going to, Daniel, I know you're\npretty good at remembering stuff,\n\n589\n00:27:55.302 --> 00:27:55.980\nbut you may not be able to\n\n590\n00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.300\nremember that whole string,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n591\n00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.740\n&gt;&gt; You wanna, see, can you,\nthink you can capture that real quick, or\n\n592\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.296\ndo you want me to just\nkeep bringing it back up?\n\n593\n00:28:01.296 --> 00:28:02.902\n&gt;&gt; The top string or the, top string.\n\n594\n00:28:02.902 --> 00:28:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Top string, top string.\n\n595\n00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.470\nWe're gonna see how quick your recall is.\n\n596\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.000\nTop string.\n\n597\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.570\nGo.\n\n598\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.139\nFF.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n599\n00:28:07.139 --> 00:28:09.292\nD8 [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; One second, hold on.\n\n600\n00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:10.201\n&gt;&gt; You're in the wrong spot.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n601\n00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:12.270\nI'm in the wrong spot on the tool.\n\n602\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.080\nAll right, so, FF.\n\n603\n00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:15.577\nWait a second, hold on, hold on.\n\n604\n00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:17.082\nFor some reason it jumped.\n\n605\n00:28:19.593 --> 00:28:20.810\nThere we go.\n\n606\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:21.473\nOkay, FF.\n\n607\n00:28:21.473 --> 00:28:21.999\n&gt;&gt; D8.\nD8.\n\n608\n00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:24.460\n&gt;&gt; FF again, I think.\n\n609\n00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n610\n00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.310\nI don't think it was FF twice.\n\n611\n00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.835\nIt was.\n\n612\n00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:27.430\nGood for you.\n\n613\n00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.520\nLook at that!\nAll right, FF.\n\n614\n00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.500\n&gt;&gt; Then EO, zero.\n\n615\n00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.160\n&gt;&gt; E, zero.\nRight, E, zero.\n\n616\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.080\nZero, zero, got that one.\n\n617\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:33.580\n&gt;&gt; One, zero.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n618\n00:28:34.748 --> 00:28:36.109\nAll right, so 10.\n\n619\n00:28:36.109 --> 00:28:38.190\nSo we've made that change.\n\n620\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.125\nAnd we can see that we've\nnow put that back, right,\n\n621\n00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:43.140\nthe way that it should normally be.\n\n622\n00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.210\nAll right, so we're gonna do that.\n\n623\n00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.620\nNow, obviously, what we're gonna\nhave to do is save this, right?\n\n624\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.240\nSo let's go in here, we'll go to File,\nwe'll go to Save As.\n\n625\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.010\nWe don't wanna overwrite the original.\n\n626\n00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.200\nLet's go ahead and let's call this\nCohiba D, A, N, for Cohiba DAN.\n\n627\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.900\nThat way we know it's the file\nthat we modified just now, and\n\n628\n00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.610\nthat Daniel was helping us to modify.\n\n629\n00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.600\nAll right, so we're gonna do that.\n\n630\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.620\nLet's just close that real quick.\n\n631\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.840\nLet's just minimize that, and we should\nhave Cohiba DAN right over there.\n\n632\n00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.020\nThere's our file.\n\n633\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.280\nLet's double-click.\n\n634\n00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.430\nLet's open that up with Paint.\n\n635\n00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.450\nAnd what do we get?\n\n636\n00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Voila.\n\n637\n00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Voila, right.\n\n638\n00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.320\nWe got the file back.\n\n639\n00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.390\nSo, just by doing a simple,\nand just zoom in so\n\n640\n00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.640\nyou can definitely see it\nis the actual file name.\n\n641\n00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.065\nRight, just by doing a simple\nbit manipulation in the header,\n\n642\n00:29:23.065 --> 00:29:27.410\nwe're actually able to modify a file,\nprevent it from being opened.\n\n643\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.355\nNotice, we didn't modify\nthe data in any way.\n\n644\n00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:30.324\nFile's intact, right?\n\n645\n00:29:30.324 --> 00:29:32.720\nI mean,\nthat is the exact file we looked at.\n\n646\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.540\nAnd if there was steganographic\ninformation in this file, by the way,\n\n647\n00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.270\nit would also still be intact.\n\n648\n00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.280\nWe didn't modify anything.\n\n649\n00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.180\nAll we did was modify a very small set\nof string of bits at the beginning\n\n650\n00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.650\nthat modified the file itself, or the\nheader of the file itself,in such a way\n\n651\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.430\nthat it prevented us, or specifically\nprevented the machine, Windows,\n\n652\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.790\nfrom understanding how to open it.\n\n653\n00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.750\nBut we didn't in any way impact the\nintegrity or the structure of the file.\n\n654\n00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.290\nThis is one way that steganography,\nalthough it's very basic and\n\n655\n00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.910\nnot a traditional way of\nthinking about steganography, but\n\n656\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:06.050\none way that we can use steganography,\nmanipulation of data,\n\n657\n00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.620\nin the container to hide the meaning or\nto hide other data in the file,\n\n658\n00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.520\nto essentially secret data in and\nout of a system.\n\n659\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.480\nBecause if you look at that file,\nit looks essentially like a text file.\n\n660\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.920\nYou don't really know what it is, and\n\n661\n00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.990\nyou probably don't pay much\nattention to those files.\n\n662\n00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.500\nWe bury that somewhere, and\n\n663\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.110\nwe could then sneak that out of\nthe system without you knowing.\n\n664\n00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.280\nAnd you would never know\nthat that actually is maybe,\n\n665\n00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.770\nmaybe I took a picture of a document\nthat's secret that I want to have, right?\n\n666\n00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.010\nAnd I couldn't copy it all down, but\n\n667\n00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.270\nI took a picture of it,\nmodified the bits real quick, and\n\n668\n00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.940\nthen stored it there as a text file so I\ncould just simply send it to myself later.\n\n669\n00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:42.335\nNow, what's the likelihood of you walking\naround with a hex editor on your machine.\n\n670\n00:30:42.335 --> 00:30:43.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably not really good.\n\n671\n00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.300\nBut could you have that as a piece of\nsoftware you put on a thumb drive and\n\n672\n00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.460\nload up real quick?\n\n673\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.090\nYeah, that wouldn't be hard to do at all.\n\n674\n00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.330\nAnd the Hex Editor is\nan incredibly powerful tool.\n\n675\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.870\nThis is just one way to use it.\n\n676\n00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.030\nBut this is a very important way for us to\nbe able to reach in, examine, understand,\n\n677\n00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.520\nand manipulate the actual bits\nthat go on inside the system there\n\n678\n00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.330\nwith regards to this particular photo.\n\n679\n00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.264\nThese are all examples of different\nways that we can steganographically\n\n680\n00:31:07.264 --> 00:31:08.250\nmodify data.\n\n681\n00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.400\nSo it's a pretty basic demonstration,\nlet me honest, it's not all that exciting.\n\n682\n00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.950\nBut it is actually, I think,\n\n683\n00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.825\na pretty great way to\nillustrate how important it is.\n\n684\n00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:20.330\nJust something as simple a few\nbits in the header of the image.\n\n685\n00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.480\nHow important it is to for us to see\nHFIs to examine data and not take for\n\n686\n00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.190\ngranted that something is what it is.\n\n687\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.310\nBecause when we go we look under the hood,\nwe find that it's it's really not\n\n688\n00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.060\nthat file, it's actually a file that's\nhad some modification done to it.\n\n689\n00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.100\nAnd when I put it back, we can see that\nit is exactly what it is supposed to be.\n\n690\n00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.470\nAnd by the way,\nthat string that we used, right,\n\n691\n00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.820\nto be able to put the data back,\nthis one right here, right?\n\n692\n00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.110\nThat's the standard string that we\nwould use to identify a JPEG file.\n\n693\n00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:51.020\nSo we could actually just use that in the\nheader to make that file back into a JPEG.\n\n694\n00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.500\nSo it's knowing that, obviously,\n\n695\n00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.190\nand having that knowledge\nwould allow us to put it back.\n\n696\n00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.703\nSo just an interesting little way of\nlooking at some steganogrpahy and\n\n697\n00:31:58.703 --> 00:32:02.500\nsome ideas about steganography in\nterms of how we can recover data.\n\n698\n00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.970\nWe actually wanna go through and\ntalk about some of the mechanisms,\n\n699\n00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.680\nthe methods, and\nthe methodologies associated with it.\n\n700\n00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.960\nThis was more of a hey,\nlet me show you and tell you what goes on,\n\n701\n00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.840\nas opposed to a let me\nexplain to you what goes on.\n\n702\n00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.330\nI think we're gonna have a part two, come\nback and do the how do we actually do and\n\n703\n00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.030\nexplain it conversation.\n\n704\n00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.785\nBut at least you got to see some\nof the mechanisms, the ways, and\n\n705\n00:32:21.785 --> 00:32:25.260\nmost importantly, the actual live\ntechniques we may use to examine data.\n\n706\n00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.270\n&gt;&gt; And this is a very nefarious\ntechnique that is used very often.\n\n707\n00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.070\nit is not just some, like Adam, he showed\nyou a very basic way in which to do this,\n\n708\n00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.430\nbut people use this all the time for\n\n709\n00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.060\nextremely, I'll say nefarious again,\nnefarious purposes.\n\n710\n00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.750\nWe've, counter-terrorism people have\ncaught people using this type of\n\n711\n00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.395\ntechniques to pass information\nfrom one person to another.\n\n712\n00:32:47.395 --> 00:32:48.740\nAnti-espionage.\n\n713\n00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.190\nThis is a very common technique\nin that realm of the world.\n\n714\n00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.370\nAnd not only that, the other dark seedy\npeople that exist on the Internet out\n\n715\n00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.910\nthere, they use this for\nother purposes like that as well.\n\n716\n00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.910\nHow to access certain servers that\nmight have illegal content on it.\n\n717\n00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.810\nThat kind of thing.\n\n718\n00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:10.117\nSo, knowing how to find these things,\nknowing how to, like Adam said,\n\n719\n00:33:10.117 --> 00:33:12.950\ndon't take it for granted that\nthis file is what it says it is.\n\n720\n00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.555\nIt may look innocuous,\nlet's do our due diligence,\n\n721\n00:33:15.555 --> 00:33:18.570\nlet's be thorough and\nmake sure we go through everything and\n\n722\n00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:22.305\nverify that it is what it says it is and\ndoesn't contain any, maybe,\n\n723\n00:33:22.305 --> 00:33:27.015\nhidden information that we might need for\nour case or our certain circumstance.\n\n724\n00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:28.695\nAdam, we're looking forward\nto that part two, man.\n\n725\n00:33:28.695 --> 00:33:32.165\nIt's gonna be a whole lot of fun\nto dive into this even further.\n\n726\n00:33:32.165 --> 00:33:34.415\nBut you're right,\nwe're well out of time for this episode.\n\n727\n00:33:34.415 --> 00:33:36.705\nSo definitely join is back for part two.\n\n728\n00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:38.245\nWe're gonna continue on down this road.\n\n729\n00:33:38.245 --> 00:33:39.191\nYou're gonna wanna see that.\n\n730\n00:33:39.191 --> 00:33:41.360\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go to sign off.\n\n731\n00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.410\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n732\n00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.003\n&gt;&gt; I'm the Steganographic Man.\n\n733\n00:33:46.003 --> 00:33:49.443\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.047\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.077\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:19.818\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.120\nwe're here for CHFI, that's right.\n\n7\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.424\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nagain for part two on steganography,\n\n8\n00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:29.011\nif I can say that three times fast,\nit is our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.150\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.575\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello, hello.\n\n11\n00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.935\nSo we're gonna continue talking about\nsteganography, very exciting stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.711\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.\n\n13\n00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The end, thanks for watching.\n\n14\n00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.035\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's been a great episode,\nappreciate the time.\n\n15\n00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:43.025\nSo we're gonna continue\ndiving a little deeper here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.155\nYou know, in part one, so\nto speak, we started out by just\n\n17\n00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:48.775\ndefining what steganography is,\ngave you a quick definition.\n\n18\n00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:53.395\nSpent the entire episode showing\nyou how to engage in finding files,\n\n19\n00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:56.980\nexamining them, doing a little bit of\nediting in there with a hex editor.\n\n20\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.610\nTalked about a lot of different\nways we can apply that knowledge.\n\n21\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.197\nWhat I wanna do here is spend\na little time just talking about\n\n22\n00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:01.777\nthe theory with you.\n\n23\n00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:05.403\nTalk about what's going on,\nhow it works, how do we actually engage\n\n24\n00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:09.210\nin steganography, what kind of\nsteganographic techniques exist.\n\n25\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.969\nIt's always good to know\nwhat the particulars,\n\n26\n00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:13.726\nif you will, are of a subject.\n\n27\n00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:17.355\nWhen we talk about how to do it, it's good\nto have the background theoretically,\n\n28\n00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.248\nespecially if you're planning\non perhaps taking the CHFI exam,\n\n29\n00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:23.705\nwould always be good knowledge for\nyou to bring to the table so to speak.\n\n30\n00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.955\nWe have a variety of different\ntechniques with regard to CHFI.\n\n31\n00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:28.555\nWe can use substitution.\n\n32\n00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.145\nWe can use transformation.\n\n33\n00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:32.495\nWe can use statistical steganography.\n\n34\n00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:37.750\nDistortion, cover generation, technical,\nlinguistic, image, audio, video,\n\n35\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.760\nthe list goes on and on,\nit is a plethora, as we say.\n\n36\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.910\nThat's just a fancy term for\n\n37\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.920\na whole big heaping amount of\nsteganographic techniques, right?\n\n38\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.990\nSo let's talk about substitution for\na minute.\n\n39\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.750\nSubstitution, the idea of\nessentially going in literally and\n\n40\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.040\ntaking certain things out and\nplugging in other things.\n\n41\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.910\nYou saw me demonstrate this with\nthe hex editing in the last episode.\n\n42\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.120\nIf you haven't seen that,\ngo back and watch that.\n\n43\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.000\nWe did a whole little run through\non editing a bitmap, or excuse me,\n\n44\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.800\nediting a JPEG and rendering it inoperable\njust by doing a quick substitution.\n\n45\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.350\nAnd swapping out some of\nthe bits in the header.\n\n46\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.194\nAnd then we were able to show how\nto put it back to the same way.\n\n47\n00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:19.550\nDaniel was kind enough\nto help me to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.050\nSo substituting redundant information or\npulling out information and\n\n49\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.370\nthen putting in the secret information in\nplace of it is the idea of substitution.\n\n50\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.820\nWhat about transformation?\n\n51\n00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.960\nWe embed the secret message,\n\n52\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.880\nwhatever the data is that we\nwant to steganographically use.\n\n53\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.925\nWe put that into a transform space,\n\n54\n00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:40.340\ntypically an area inside\nthe signal if it's an audio file.\n\n55\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.600\nInside the white space or the slack space,\nif it's a hard drive or a file.\n\n56\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.320\nYou saw me do that with\nthe demonstration where I did the online\n\n57\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.510\ntransformation of the image file and\nincluded the little data.\n\n58\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.910\nThis is my test, right?\n\n59\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.660\nThat was essentially a transform.\n\n60\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.440\nI took the image, added the data in,\ncombined the two together.\n\n61\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.170\nHid the image or\nrather used the image as a container.\n\n62\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.598\nHid the data behind it so,\nyou couldn't see it.\n\n63\n00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:07.360\nAnd then when we unwrap the two and\nseparated them,\n\n64\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.500\nI was able to see the data again.\n\n65\n00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.145\nHello, there was my data\nright right there, right?\n\n66\n00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.455\nSo, I was able to do that.\n\n67\n00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:13.885\nSo, that was a transform.\n\n68\n00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:15.415\nWe demonstrated that for you as well.\n\n69\n00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:17.215\nWe did a huge amount of stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:18.915\nWe deserve a break by the way.\n\n71\n00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.265\nWe worked hard on that last episode.\n&gt;&gt; Where's my mai-tai?\n\n72\n00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:24.258\n&gt;&gt; Nobody actually even said thank you or\nrecognized that we did that,\n\n73\n00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:25.685\nthat is something pretty cool.\n\n74\n00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.005\nYou guys got to see all that great stuff.\n\n75\n00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.200\nThink about that, we did a substitution,\nwe did a transformation.\n\n76\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.670\nWe could do statistical, a technique\nwhere we embed messages by altering\n\n77\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.050\nthe statistical properties,\nthe actual properties of the cover object.\n\n78\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.900\nAnd we then have to guess to\nfigure out what may be in there.\n\n79\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.210\nI didn't show you statistical, but\n\n80\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.690\nI hinted at the fact that there was\nsomething wrong with one of the pictures.\n\n81\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.860\nWe took a look at the Sam JPEG, right?\n\n82\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.856\nAnd we took that StegSpy software, ran the\npicture through it, and said, hey look In\n\n83\n00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:56.818\nthe middle of that picture somewhere\nthere's something going on that's unusual.\n\n84\n00:03:56.818 --> 00:03:59.900\nI'm making a guess essentially\nwhat the software said.\n\n85\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.320\nI'm making a guess that there's some\nsort of steganography applied to this.\n\n86\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.520\nYou should investigate that.\n\n87\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.300\nWhile I didn't demonstrate how to\nimplement something with statistical\n\n88\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300\nsteganography, I showed\nyou the output of it and\n\n89\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.340\nhow to detect it by using that tool.\n\n90\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.480\nWe're three for three, we're on a roll.\n\n91\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.770\nWe talked about distortion.\n\n92\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.191\nThis is audio-based or\nvideo-based steganography,\n\n93\n00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:26.066\nwhere we manipulate the carrier signal or\nthe underlying images in the frames so\n\n94\n00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.340\nthat we can hide data inside of them.\n\n95\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.823\nBut to the average human listening or\nseeing or watching,\n\n96\n00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:32.940\nwe really don't pick up on that.\n\n97\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.030\nThe frame rate for a replay on a video,\ndepending whether it's high def or\n\n98\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.270\nwhatever it is, Is gonna vary.\n\n99\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.850\nBut the human eye can essentially offset\nthe dropping of several frames or\n\n100\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.820\nthe manipulation of frames, and you don't\nsee that the frame has been manipulated.\n\n101\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.240\nThis would be the point where,\nhad we set this up ahead of time,\n\n102\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.370\nwe would have the subliminal\nmessaging flashing up on the screen.\n\n103\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.380\nSo nobody really knows\nwhat we're doing but\n\n104\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.320\nwe're actually manipulating\nthe stream in real time.\n\n105\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.315\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\nI just saw an X-Files episode,\n\n106\n00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:02.985\nI was going through the X-files again,\nof this exact thing.\n\n107\n00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:03.693\n&gt;&gt; I love that show.\n\n108\n00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:05.510\n&gt;&gt; It's one of my favorites of all time.\n\n109\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.931\nOf this exact thing where they were hiding\na subliminal signal inside of the TV and\n\n110\n00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:11.763\npeople were killing each other.\n\n111\n00:05:11.763 --> 00:05:14.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthey all get zombied out and go nuts,\n\n112\n00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:16.070\ntheres a few of those examples.\n\n113\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.212\nDid you see the newer ones they made?\n\n114\n00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:19.132\nThey had them come back for\na few episodes.\n\n115\n00:05:19.132 --> 00:05:19.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, saw it, totally.\n\n116\n00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:20.987\n&gt;&gt; Those were really cool.\n\n117\n00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, those are really cool.\n\n118\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.538\n&gt;&gt; Mulder was right, the truth is out\nthere and I always liked a Scully,\n\n119\n00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:26.164\nshe was cool.\n\n120\n00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:27.747\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Great show.\n\n121\n00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:29.416\n&gt;&gt; And Marlboro Man.\n\n122\n00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:30.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cancer Man, they called him.\n\n123\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.403\n&gt;&gt; Cancer Man, well, I call him\nMarlboro Man cuz I don't smoke so\n\n124\n00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:34.513\nI don't know any better.\n\n125\n00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:35.057\nBut yeah Cancer Guy.\n\n126\n00:05:35.057 --> 00:05:39.761\nAnd there were several of them,\nthat older guy that played the character.\n\n127\n00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.449\nBut then there were other\npeople that came in and out,\n\n128\n00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.740\nkind of the person who would always\nhook them up, that helped them, right?\n\n129\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.581\nI forget the gentleman's name.\n\n130\n00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:50.190\n&gt;&gt; Well there was two in the first\nseason and that guy died and then they-\n\n131\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Right they kill him off, but\n\n132\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.530\nthen the older guy.\n\n133\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.550\n&gt;&gt; The successor to him.\n\n134\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Kind of the crazy looking one, the\nscary one, comes out and he's there for\n\n135\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.290\na long time.\n\n136\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.220\nHe's there for almost the whole thing.\n\n137\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.130\nIt was really cool.\n\n138\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.930\n&gt;&gt; Random aside.\n\n139\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.620\n&gt;&gt; Really cool.\n\n140\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.636\nWe always have one of those.\n\n141\n00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:02.260\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n142\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.700\n&gt;&gt; At least one.\n\n143\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.160\nDistortion can be done.\n\n144\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.860\nNow a lot of times if you\ndistort an audio signal,\n\n145\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.380\nyou may not hear it depending on the\nfrequency that the distortion occurs at.\n\n146\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.143\nSo if we manipulate a high frequency in\nthe carrier wave that humans are not able\n\n147\n00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:19.147\nto hear, we piss off the dogs, but the\nhumans, they don't know it's happening.\n\n148\n00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:20.490\n&gt;&gt; They're none the wiser.\n\n149\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.730\n&gt;&gt; That's why you need a dog around\nto steganographically identify\n\n150\n00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.710\nthat the carrier signal has been modified.\n\n151\n00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.670\nThey're howling in the corner,\nholding their ears.\n\n152\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.750\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\n153\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.469\nBut we figured out there's steganographic\nmodification happening inside that.\n\n154\n00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.233\nSo cover generation, encoding Information\nthat ensures we are somehow creating and\n\n155\n00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.175\ncovering it.\n\n156\n00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:43.355\nPutting it into the cover medium\nis what we often talk about.\n\n157\n00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:47.375\nSo we wanna think about that, in general,\nas just a way that steganography happens.\n\n158\n00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.987\nWhat about technical steganography?\n\n159\n00:06:48.987 --> 00:06:52.592\nUse of physical or\nchemical means to hide information.\n\n160\n00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:56.362\nThis may be something like\nusing a microdot in a letter.\n\n161\n00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:57.962\nThis is an old school way of doing it.\n\n162\n00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:01.352\nWhat about something like,\nwhat is it, invisible ink, right?\n\n163\n00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:04.702\nI mean, these are examples from old\nschool methodologies from years,\n\n164\n00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:07.552\nsometimes decades, hundreds of years ago.\n\n165\n00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.872\nPeople have been using invisible ink for\nprobably close to two centuries.\n\n166\n00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:14.420\nThey've been using heat-based inks, things\nthat you write on that are invisible.\n\n167\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.302\nYou heat them and things like that to\nessentially carry out cryptographic\n\n168\n00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:20.065\ntransmissions of information.\n\n169\n00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.244\nBut we're stegonagraphically\nmodifying the medium to do that, and\n\n170\n00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:25.650\nthat's really what we're talking about.\n\n171\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.550\nLinguistic, we can use language to\nhide things in non-obvious ways.\n\n172\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.140\nWe can have perhaps the ability to be able\nto use the sentence that in one way could\n\n173\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.595\nbe interpreted this way, but perhaps in\nanother context is interpreted this way.\n\n174\n00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:41.430\nYou know a lot of times, especially\nin older languages, that may not be\n\n175\n00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.695\nnecessarily relevant and spoken very much\nany more, there are different ways of\n\n176\n00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:50.695\ninterpreting certain words, or pictograms,\nsignals and pictures of things.\n\n177\n00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:55.049\nAnd as a result, a bird may represent\none thing when used a certain way,\n\n178\n00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:58.473\nmay represent something else\nwhen used in another way.\n\n179\n00:07:58.473 --> 00:07:59.426\nSo a lot of times,\n\n180\n00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:03.830\nwe can hide the meaning of what we are\nsuggesting based on manipulating language.\n\n181\n00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.558\nWe talked a little bit about images,\nI've shown you, and\n\n182\n00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:09.410\nwe've talked about some of\nthe ways images can be modified.\n\n183\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.070\nWe've done some demonstrations\nin the prior episode for you.\n\n184\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.110\nWe talk about several types of image\nmanipulation what's called least\n\n185\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.230\nsignificant bit insertion\nwhat's called LSB.\n\n186\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.401\nLeast Significant Bit insertion, masking\nand filtering and also algorithm and\n\n187\n00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:24.390\ntransformation.\n\n188\n00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.090\nWe mentioned transformation\njust a couple of minutes ago.\n\n189\n00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.430\nBut LSB is probably the most\ncommon way of steganographically\n\n190\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.970\nmodifying an image file.\n\n191\n00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.474\nThis is where we insert data into\nthe space inside the file or\n\n192\n00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.637\ninside the image that's not being used.\n\n193\n00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:43.776\nAnd in so doing, we're able to mix our\ndata, out secret data in with the normal\n\n194\n00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:46.741\ndata inside the image but\nyou don't you're the wiser.\n\n195\n00:08:46.741 --> 00:08:49.936\nYou may or may not know about\nan artist called Seurat.\n\n196\n00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:54.825\nYou may have heard of Seurat,\nSeurat is famous as a painter because\n\n197\n00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.505\nhis thing was that he\npainted with dots of colors.\n\n198\n00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:02.531\nInstead of painting you know the way\ntraditional painters have done where they\n\n199\n00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:04.239\nwould brush stroke out an image,\n\n200\n00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:07.710\nhe would painstakingly put dots\ntogether to make an image.\n\n201\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.241\nAnd so\nwhen you look at Seurat's paintings,\n\n202\n00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:13.703\nyou have to stand at a certain distance so\nthat you essentially\n\n203\n00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:17.650\nare able to pull out the image and\nmake the images appear from the dots.\n\n204\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.950\nAnd this is the trick in\nlooking at his imagery.\n\n205\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.580\nIf you stand up close to a Seurat\npainting, you see a lot of disconnected\n\n206\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.750\ndots of color that don't\nnecessarily make an image.\n\n207\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.946\nYou walk back a certain number of feet and\n\n208\n00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:31.990\nto the focal distance essentially that\nyour eyes have to be at to see it and\n\n209\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.790\nthen all of a sudden out of no\nwhere literally, it's like magic.\n\n210\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.490\nThe image appears.\n\n211\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.350\nYou see the landscape or whatever it is.\n\n212\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.980\nDali, Salvador Dali was famous for\ndoing this as well.\n\n213\n00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.060\nSome of his pictures do this.\n\n214\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.920\nHe has a famous picture of\nthe head of Abraham Lincoln.\n\n215\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.290\nAnd so if you do a Google search and\nlook it up,\n\n216\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.520\nyou'll find that the image doesn't really\nwork when you look at it on the web.\n\n217\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.230\nYou can't really get it.\n\n218\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.370\nYou have to see it live.\n\n219\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.970\nI actually went to the Dali museum\nin Saint Petersburg recently and\n\n220\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.800\nit's just wickedly cool.\n\n221\n00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.730\nYou stand in front of this picture and\npictures like literally,\n\n222\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.260\nprobably like an eight foot\nby like seven foot picture,\n\n223\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.230\nit's a massive picture\nhanging on the wall.\n\n224\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.090\nThey have it in the museum there and\nyou stand up close to it and\n\n225\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.286\nall you see are individual squares.\n\n226\n00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:16.010\nIt's made up of the cubes\nprobably about half the size of\n\n227\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.510\nthe squares we have in the studio right?\n\n228\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.020\nThe foam right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.870\n&gt;&gt; That we have on the wall here.\n\n230\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.410\nAbout half the size.\n\n231\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.950\nAnd then you come back, literally,\nto a certain focal point and they have it,\n\n232\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.540\nyou know you stand on the museum they\ntell you exactly where to stand, right?\n\n233\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.000\nIts like alright go to this point and\nbe ten feet away or whatever it is.\n\n234\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.650\nAnd all of a sudden you actually see\nLincoln's head materialize out of this\n\n235\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.870\njust random landscape, and\nit's actually Lincoln's head.\n\n236\n00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.160\nAnd it's essentially\na portrait of Lincoln.\n\n237\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.030\nBut when you look at\nthe picture otherwise,\n\n238\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.660\nit's just random squares that\nlook like absolutely nothing.\n\n239\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.930\nIt's absolutely amazing when you see this.\n\n240\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.630\nHe did the same thing.\n\n241\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.092\nHe's got some massive canvases\nin the museum that he did.\n\n242\n00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:54.630\n20 by 30 feet canvases\nthat are up on the wall.\n\n243\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.410\nThe Columbus is coming to\nthe New World and things like that.\n\n244\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.880\nAnd he does all this hidden imagery.\n\n245\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.240\nThat's what he's famous for.\n\n246\n00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.000\nIn his pictures, and they start pointing\nit all out when you look at it.\n\n247\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.870\nAnd you know, one thing will look like\nsomething and you step back and change\n\n248\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.640\nyour perspective and all of a sudden it\nlooks like something totally different.\n\n249\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.160\nThese are all examples\nof steganography and\n\n250\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.900\nsome of them are essentially\nleast significant bit insertion.\n\n251\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.260\nThe right most bit of a pixel is called or\nreferred to as, the least significant bit.\n\n252\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.710\nAnd so as a result we can break up our\ndata and insert it by swapping out for\n\n253\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.130\nthe least significant bits.\n\n254\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.570\nAnd then we're able to modify the picture\nwithout rendering any noticeable\n\n255\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.350\ndifference by simply selecting each pixel.\n\n256\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.900\nOne individual pixel is one\nlittle piece of the puzzle.\n\n257\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.320\nModifying one bit.\n\n258\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.810\nBut since there are literally\nmillions of pixels,\n\n259\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.650\nwe could insert quite a bit of data.\n\n260\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.020\nWe then just have to stitch\nall the data back together and\n\n261\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.920\npull it out of the least significant bits.\n\n262\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.801\nAnd by doing that we can reconstitute\na Word document, a picture,\n\n263\n00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:49.240\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n264\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.210\nAll we really need is a software tool that\nsplits up our data into individual bits,\n\n265\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.440\nand allows us to insert them into\nthese mapped areas inside of an image.\n\n266\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.120\nAnd we're able to do that with no trouble.\n\n267\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.750\nSo it's something that's very common,\nsomething that's often done.\n\n268\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.080\nMasking and filtering.\n\n269\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.100\nSomething else that we often do\nwith regards image steganography.\n\n270\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.130\nWe use this on 24 bit in grey\nscale images traditionally.\n\n271\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.150\nSo it's a different approach based on the\nkind of cover medium that we wanna use.\n\n272\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.770\nWe go ahead and hide.\n\n273\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.050\nThink of a watermark.\n\n274\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.980\nYou've probably seen watermarks before.\n\n275\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.509\nA digital watermark on a document,\nvery faint,\n\n276\n00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.230\nvery hard to see under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n277\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.320\nA lot of times when we have\ndigital rights management or\n\n278\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.490\ninformation rights management,\nIRM or DRM, technology.\n\n279\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.630\nAnd we see this in course ware a lot.\n\n280\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.094\nYou have course ware that has the digital\nmark down the middle and says,\n\n281\n00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.030\ndo not reproduce in black so\nit blacks out half the page.\n\n282\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.170\nYou don't see it when you're\nreading it normally on the screen.\n\n283\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.810\nBut when you go to print it, the\ninstructions on the document essentially\n\n284\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.950\nput a black bar right\ndown the middle of it.\n\n285\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.350\nThat's a digital watermark.\n\n286\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.510\nIt's been inserted on the document\nthrough masking and filtering.\n\n287\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.410\nAnd so this is one example\nof this kind of approach.\n\n288\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.110\nWe hide information so\nit's not visible, but\n\n289\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.270\nthen under certain\nconditions we could see it.\n\n290\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.310\nYou could do this with currency,\nby the way, right?\n\n291\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.760\nYou can hold up the American currency,\nmost currencies in the world\n\n292\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.130\nhave all sorts of security\nfeatures associated with them.\n\n293\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.960\nThere may be holographic images in them,\nthere may be\n\n294\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.300\nprotective measures that are only seen\nunder certain light, like black light or\n\n295\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.840\nfluorescent light of certain kinds,\nthat kind of things for wavelengths.\n\n296\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.300\nThis is all examples of that, of masking\nand/or filtering through transformation.\n\n297\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.420\nWe could also do algorithms in one way or\nanother in transformation.\n\n298\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.366\nWe embed the data in the cover image by\nchanging the mathematical properties of\n\n299\n00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:32.274\nthe cover image.\n\n300\n00:13:32.274 --> 00:13:37.065\nSo things like fast furrier, discrete\ncosine and/or wavelet are examples of\n\n301\n00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:40.994\ntechniques that are used with\nalgorithms and transformation.\n\n302\n00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:46.442\nStatistical capabilities or\nstatistical probability information in\n\n303\n00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:52.803\nthe manipulation of an image is a little\nbit beyond or mathematical manipulation.\n\n304\n00:13:52.803 --> 00:13:55.130\nA little bit beyond what\nwe are talking about here.\n\n305\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.610\nWe're just giving you some\ngeneral idea of the names and\n\n306\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.230\nthe approaches to the techniques.\n\n307\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.930\nBut understanding how to do something like\ndiscrete cosine or wavelet manipulation\n\n308\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.530\nis really going to involve getting some,\na little bit deeper and\n\n309\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.848\nbroader knowledge around steganography and\nthe tools that are used.\n\n310\n00:14:10.848 --> 00:14:13.630\nThe good news is that most of\nthe tools that we use, or we demo,\n\n311\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.750\nor we talk about have capabilities to\nmanipulate images in both directions.\n\n312\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.860\nIf they're used as detection tools, then\nyou can actually find manipulation and\n\n313\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.720\na lot of the times you could\nturn the tool around and\n\n314\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.260\nyou can see how it was done by\nessentially running it backwards.\n\n315\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.020\nLike I showed you in the web\ndemonstration that we took a look at.\n\n316\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.970\nSo you just wanna be aware\nof some of these techniques.\n\n317\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.290\nWe have audio and we can manipulate\nall sorts of audio files.\n\n318\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.420\nAll the time I've been talking to\nyou I've been actually been speaking\n\n319\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.180\nSwahili\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.430\n&gt;&gt; As well as English you just haven't\n\n321\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.745\nheard it but there's actually a whole\ntalk track underneath me that is actually\n\n322\n00:14:43.745 --> 00:14:49.370\nsinging It's a Small World in Swahili, so\nwe've manipulated the audio in real time.\n\n323\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.330\nWe do not do that by the way, I'm only\nkidding but wouldn't it be cool if we did\n\n324\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.010\nand wouldn't it be cool if you could\nthen figure out that was done.\n\n325\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.030\nThat would be an example of\naudio steganography, hiding and\n\n326\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.690\nmanipulating the actual delivery,\nthe stream of the data.\n\n327\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.220\nBut you're not hearing it, or seeing it,\n\n328\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.170\nor understanding it because it's done\nin such a way that's not obvious.\n\n329\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.602\n&gt;&gt; And now the CIA agents that\nare sleepers are awake and active.\n\n330\n00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:10.493\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; They are,\n\n331\n00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:14.740\nI've just called them all in and we're\nnow gonna have the zombie apocalypse.\n\n332\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.610\nThat'll be part three,\nwhen you come back for that.\n\n333\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.200\nSo we're referring to hiding secret\ninformation within the audio files.\n\n334\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.430\nHowever we're gonna do that.\n\n335\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.365\nThis is typically done again\nby manipulation of the LSB,\n\n336\n00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:27.975\nthe least significant bid,\nthe least significant bit, excuse me.\n\n337\n00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:31.095\nBut we use frequencies as I mentioned\nthat are inaudible to the human ear.\n\n338\n00:15:31.095 --> 00:15:35.095\nSo usually something below 20,000 hertz\nis something that we will not hear or\n\n339\n00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:38.148\nsomething very high above it as I said,\nyou'll piss off the dogs and\n\n340\n00:15:38.148 --> 00:15:39.142\nthe small furry rodents.\n\n341\n00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:41.332\nBut you won't know anything is going on.\n\n342\n00:15:41.332 --> 00:15:45.182\nSo we may use things like echo\ndata hiding, spread spectrum,\n\n343\n00:15:45.182 --> 00:15:48.602\nwhich we often talk about\nin other conversations and\n\n344\n00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:50.706\nother areas around network and\ntelecommunications.\n\n345\n00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:53.266\nMechanisms, we use frequency hoping and\n\n346\n00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:57.846\nspread spectrum as different transmission\nmedia techniques to be able to manipulate\n\n347\n00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:00.056\ndata as it flows down the wire and\nsend it.\n\n348\n00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:02.686\nWe can also use that to manipulate\nthe amount of information\n\n349\n00:16:02.686 --> 00:16:04.036\nthat is hidden inside that data.\n\n350\n00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:07.847\nSo we can do that, so direct spread\nsequence, direct sequence spread spectrum,\n\n351\n00:16:07.847 --> 00:16:09.296\nI can ever say that correctly.\n\n352\n00:16:09.296 --> 00:16:14.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] DSS, and or FHSS,\nfrequency hopping spread spectrum or\n\n353\n00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:18.240\ntechniques that may be used there.\n\n354\n00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.140\nI mentioned LSB, least significant\nbit coding, toner insertion, and\n\n355\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.830\nor phase decoding.\n\n356\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.090\nWe can actually shift the signal\nto noise ratios around, and\n\n357\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.950\nbe able to put in more or\nless white noise in the background, and\n\n358\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.630\nwe can actually hide information in\nthe white noise carrier signals as well.\n\n359\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.920\nSo a lot of times, when you're listening\nto the background recording of noise that\n\n360\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:44.970\nmay be going on in an audio feed, you'll\nhear and see on some of these crime shows,\n\n361\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.920\nthey try to boost up certain noise and\nminimize others,\n\n362\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.750\nbecause they're trying to identify where\nsomebody is, or whatever was going on.\n\n363\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.880\nThere's a lot of Information that\ngets captured in a recording.\n\n364\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.490\nYou just don't always realize and\nlisten to it all,\n\n365\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.750\nbecause you may not\nseparate out the tones.\n\n366\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.790\nA lot of times, in those shows,\nyou'll here, hey,\n\n367\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.140\nlet's boost that signal up,\nlet's drop that.\n\n368\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.030\nYeah, I can hear now.\n\n369\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.340\nThere's a boat whistle in the background,\nor something crazy.\n\n370\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.860\nBut a trained audio technician is\nactually to figure this stuff out,\n\n371\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.560\nbecause all of the input data,\nthe singles are there in the recording.\n\n372\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.850\nWe just some obviously heavy\nduty gear to separate and\n\n373\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.130\nisolate them, understand what they are,\nplay them back, and\n\n374\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.640\nthen understand them in the context\nof whatever else there.\n\n375\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.150\nSo, if we can do that,\nif we can isolate those signals,\n\n376\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.850\nwe can actually figure out how to\npull this data out of the recording.\n\n377\n00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.710\nVideo can be used as a media as well,\n\n378\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.620\nwhether it is something like a Blu-ray,\na DVD disk, whatever.\n\n379\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.520\nBut generically,\nwhatever we will consider streaming media,\n\n380\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.870\nwe can also hide signals in there,\nnot unusual to be able to do that.\n\n381\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.075\nDidn't one of the Halloween movies have\nthat concept in there where they were\n\n382\n00:17:47.075 --> 00:17:48.805\nsending the signal early on, right,\n\n383\n00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:51.955\nthrough the TV to activate\neverybody that had the masks on?\n\n384\n00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:55.275\nRight, so that they would then turn\ninto the crazy psychos during Halloween?\n\n385\n00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:57.142\nWasn't one of the first\nHalloween movies a theme,\n\n386\n00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.106\nI thought there was something\nin one of those movies?\n\n387\n00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:00.852\nI think it was,\nI could be wrong, I don't know.\n\n388\n00:18:00.852 --> 00:18:05.980\nBut I thought it was, maybe not,\nmaybe I'm thinking of a different movie.\n\n389\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.320\nBut I remember at some point, I saw\na movie where the kids had on the masks,\n\n390\n00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.320\nthe pumpkin masks or something, and there\nwas some sort of signal that came through\n\n391\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.120\nthe TV that turned them\ninto raving psychos.\n\n392\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.290\nIt was essentially, basically,\na carrier signal manipulation.\n\n393\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.930\nBut I don't know,\nmaybe I'm just totally out of left field.\n\n394\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.040\n&gt;&gt; It's a Disney movie, right?\n\n395\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.265\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it came out right\nafter the credits, right after Bambi.\n\n396\n00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:31.675\nIt was the Easter egg that was right\nthere, so just some things to think about.\n\n397\n00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:34.640\nAnyway, what are issues to\nconsider with regards to this?\n\n398\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.226\nSo, what's the level of visibility?\n\n399\n00:18:36.226 --> 00:18:39.660\nMeaning, are we tipping the balance\nbetween the carrier, right,\n\n400\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.560\nthe amount of data that we wanna put in,\nand the cover, the mechanism.\n\n401\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.100\nAnd if we're not balancing those two,\nand we put too much in,\n\n402\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.040\nand the container is not able to\ncontain it all, it spills out,\n\n403\n00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.160\nwe actually see that\nwe've modified the image.\n\n404\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.020\nIf we do it in such a way that the image\nis hidden, because the cover material is\n\n405\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.320\nenough to essentially constrain it,\nthen we're not tipping the balance.\n\n406\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.050\nAnd we have to really keep this\nin mind and understand this.\n\n407\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.550\nSo, level of visibility, and\n\n408\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.190\nreally just how we deal with\nthis is something to consider.\n\n409\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.332\nWe also have to think about what we call,\nwhat we call file format dependencies,\n\n410\n00:19:10.332 --> 00:19:15.110\nthe idea of how we deal with manipulation,\nand how we deal with compression.\n\n411\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.305\nEither lossy or lossless, and\nI always love talking about these.\n\n412\n00:19:18.305 --> 00:19:20.900\nCuz you say these to people, and\nthey have no clue what they are.\n\n413\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.000\nAnd they usually, when you talk about\nthese, will guess the recommended\n\n414\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.310\ndefinition, which is the exact opposite\nof what most people think it is.\n\n415\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.665\nSo, when we think about lossy compression,\nthink about lossy compression.\n\n416\n00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:38.040\nL-O-S-S-Y, lossy,\nas in I lost something, right?\n\n417\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.620\nLossy compression, this reduces the file\nsize by permanently eliminating or\n\n418\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.140\ndeleting certain information.\n\n419\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.040\nEssentially, it does not keep\nthe integrity of the image.\n\n420\n00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.760\nSo, lossy means hey, we lost stuff,\nkind of the name implies, but\n\n421\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.240\npeople tend to get this backwards.\n\n422\n00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.210\nThey think lossless means I lost stuff,\nand lossy means I don't.\n\n423\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.130\nI don't know why.\n\n424\n00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.060\nI would, if somebody said to me you lost\nsomething, I'd go okay I lost something.\n\n425\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.150\nI get it, it's not there.\n\n426\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.130\nSo, we don't maintain data integrity.\n\n427\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.280\nLossy compression does not\nmaintain data integrity.\n\n428\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.560\nWhich means that when\nwe use this technique,\n\n429\n00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.680\nwe are getting rid of redundant\ninformation, typically.\n\n430\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.200\nWhen we do, what do we do with tapes?\n\n431\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.390\nWhat we, having a brainless moment,\na lossy moment.\n\n432\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.591\nWhen we do the, get rid of all the all\nof the duplicate DATA, whoop de doop.\n\n433\n00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:30.055\nThis is how we put words together,\nboys and girls and make language, right?\n\n434\n00:20:30.055 --> 00:20:32.418\nWhen we de doop,\nwe are using lossy compression,\n\n435\n00:20:32.418 --> 00:20:35.853\nwe're getting rid of redundant\ninformation, in order to streamline,\n\n436\n00:20:35.853 --> 00:20:37.843\nthat's essentially what we're doing.\n\n437\n00:20:37.843 --> 00:20:42.067\nSo if we're taking advantage of that,\nand we're hiding our data in areas that\n\n438\n00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:46.035\nare redundant, we may or not have a\nproblem as a result of that, or we may or\n\n439\n00:20:46.035 --> 00:20:48.230\nmay be able to secret the data away.\n\n440\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.785\nSo we have to understand that lossy\ncompression In certain audio or\n\n441\n00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:55.095\nvideo files,\nthey prove to be an image issue, or\n\n442\n00:20:55.095 --> 00:20:59.475\na container issue for us with regards\nto how we steganographically modify.\n\n443\n00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:03.055\nLossless compression retains\nthe integrity of the image.\n\n444\n00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:05.972\nWe don't get rid of all\nthe redundant data, but rather,\n\n445\n00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:09.462\nwe just reduce the file size down\nusing other compression techniques.\n\n446\n00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:15.092\nLZ77 is a lossless compression format,\nfor instance.\n\n447\n00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:17.892\nIt's a file type,\nwe maintain data integrity.\n\n448\n00:21:17.892 --> 00:21:22.947\nAlgorithms that are used for this,\nHuffman coding, and what's the other one?\n\n449\n00:21:22.947 --> 00:21:28.320\nLempel-Ziv are coding algorithms\nthat are used to do lossless.\n\n450\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.360\nSo, jpeg would be an example, for\ninstance, of a format that uses lossy\n\n451\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.780\ncompression, so as an image format\nwhen we save an image file.\n\n452\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.475\nWhen we save it as a jpeg file,\nwe're using lawsi compression.\n\n453\n00:21:41.475 --> 00:21:45.115\nWe're actually getting rid of redundant\ninformation to streamline the file.\n\n454\n00:21:45.115 --> 00:21:48.135\nAnd if we stenographically\nmodify that image, and\n\n455\n00:21:48.135 --> 00:21:52.165\nwe put data into redundant spaces,\nwe may drop that when we save it, and\n\n456\n00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:55.295\nwhen we actually blow up the image,\ninstead of actually modifying it.\n\n457\n00:21:55.295 --> 00:21:57.795\nSo, we just have to be\naware of these subtleties\n\n458\n00:21:57.795 --> 00:21:59.215\nwhen we're doing the conversion.\n\n459\n00:21:59.215 --> 00:22:02.635\nBecause if we choose the wrong\ntype of storage mechanism,\n\n460\n00:22:02.635 --> 00:22:06.170\nthe wrong type of file format,\nwe may wind up actually screwing it up.\n\n461\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.910\nAnd not being able to modify\nthe file steganographically, which\n\n462\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.840\nwould be potentially a bad outcome for the\nbad actor, good for us as an investigator.\n\n463\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.356\nBe easier for us to find when there's half\na hand sticking out of the page, right?\n\n464\n00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:18.317\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n465\n00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:20.207\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is that, right, exactly, so\n\n466\n00:22:20.207 --> 00:22:22.753\nThe art and\nscience of analyzing these files, and\n\n467\n00:22:22.753 --> 00:22:26.530\ndiscovering images that have been\nmodified is called steganalysis.\n\n468\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.420\nWe talked about steganography as the\nability to modify images and hide data.\n\n469\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.600\nSteganalysis is the thought\nprocess about analyzing them, and\n\n470\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.010\nunderstanding they have been modified.\n\n471\n00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.240\nSo, you become versed in the arts of\nsteganalysis when you want to uncover\n\n472\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.810\nsteganography and\nsteganographically modified images.\n\n473\n00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.120\nAnd speaking of images, we do have\na whole bunch of image terminology,\n\n474\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.770\nvocabulary that goes\nassociated with an image.\n\n475\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.220\nThese are on the show notes.\n\n476\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.270\nYou're gonna want to take a look at them.\n\n477\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.470\nBut things like pixel,\n\n478\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.900\nwe mentioned that already, single\npoint within the image that we define.\n\n479\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.190\nBit depth, the number of colors\navailable for each pixel.\n\n480\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.510\nThat's defined as bit depth.\n\n481\n00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.300\nResolution, sharpness and\nclarity, pretty straightforward.\n\n482\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.560\nMost of us probably mess around with that\nwith our monitors and things like that.\n\n483\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.790\nFile formats, we just talked about those,\nways to encode data and save them.\n\n484\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.630\nImage file size, measured in\nbytes how big the file is itself.\n\n485\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.740\nCompression, how we make things bigger or\nsmaller, uncompress and compress.\n\n486\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.060\nLossless lossy, we just explained this.\n\n487\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.000\nVector images, these use geographical,\ngeographical, geometrical,\n\n488\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.430\nI always confuse the two;\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Use geometrical primitives.\n\n490\n00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.950\nPoints, lines, curves,\nthings like that to then be able to base\n\n491\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.930\nthe understanding of how to\ninterpret the image upon.\n\n492\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.870\nAnd then we use mathematical\nrepresentations to essentially generate\n\n493\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.100\nthe image, or raster images.\n\n494\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.120\nThis represents a rectangular\ngrid of pixels, and\n\n495\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.520\nthen we plot them out on there.\n\n496\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.290\nSo, we often interact with\nboth of these kinds of images,\n\n497\n00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.590\nwe just don't always think about what\nthey are, and where they come from.\n\n498\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.600\nBut vector and raster-based images,\nwanna just be aware of those.\n\n499\n00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.900\nStandard image file format types,\nthere's a whole bunch I gave you,\n\n500\n00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.100\nI think a list of six or\nseven for standard.\n\n501\n00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.025\nAnd six or seven for\nnonstandard, and the show nodes,\n\n502\n00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:07.972\nyou probably wanna be aware of,\nbut things like jpg, jpg 2000,\n\n503\n00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:11.154\ngift tip PNG, these are standard formats.\n\n504\n00:24:11.154 --> 00:24:13.827\nYou may not know what the acronyms are,\nI did spell them out for\n\n505\n00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:16.260\nyou in the notes there so\nyou can take a look at them.\n\n506\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.460\nFor instance, you know what JPEG is\nwithout looking at my notes that tell me?\n\n507\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.640\nCuz I know you could see them but,\nmost people don't know what it is.\n\n508\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.800\n&gt;&gt; If I was Wes, I'd know.\n\n509\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.440\nWes know every acronym known to man.\n\n510\n00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.860\n&gt;&gt; So we gotta get Wes and ask Wes.\n\n511\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta ask Wes on that one.\n\n512\n00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.480\n&gt;&gt; But I did give you the definition.\n\n513\n00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.300\nSo JPEG is joint\nphotographic experts group.\n\n514\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.112\nThat's what JPEG,\nthe actual extension actually stands for.\n\n515\n00:24:35.112 --> 00:24:37.240\nSee now, you can take a look at this,\nwe put it in there but\n\n516\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.030\nthen there's a whole bunch of\nnon-standard formats as well.\n\n517\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.700\nA lot of people heard of of targa,\nthat's not an unusual one.\n\n518\n00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.295\nSome people specially if you do\nphotography, you heard of that one.\n\n519\n00:24:45.295 --> 00:24:48.547\nRegister transfer for language,\nPhotoshop, Illustrator, Freehand,\n\n520\n00:24:48.547 --> 00:24:51.084\na bunch of different programs\nhave their own extensions.\n\n521\n00:24:51.084 --> 00:24:53.281\nThese are all gonna be non standard.\n\n522\n00:24:53.281 --> 00:24:56.513\nFile types that we use and we see but\nwe may not think about and\n\n523\n00:24:56.513 --> 00:24:58.529\nmay not use on a regular bases right.\n\n524\n00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:00.762\nSome just, little doodads, little bits and\n\n525\n00:25:00.762 --> 00:25:04.417\npieces of information that may wanna\nassociate with certain file types.\n\n526\n00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:08.892\nGifs for instance, we have a RGB red,\ngreen, blue color pallet that\n\n527\n00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:13.480\nwe often will talk about and\ndescribe values in the image through.\n\n528\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.210\nAnd we have a value range 0 to 255 for\neach of the color values that we use\n\n529\n00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.040\nto essentially create the various\ncolors that are making up the photo and\n\n530\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.326\nwe manipulate those and save them\noffice information inside the file.\n\n531\n00:25:25.326 --> 00:25:31.310\nSo, you wanna be aware that we have two\nkinds of GIF file formats, 87A and 89A.\n\n532\n00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.836\nAnd depending on which one we use and\nwhich one we choose,\n\n533\n00:25:33.836 --> 00:25:35.109\nwe get different outcomes.\n\n534\n00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:40.960\n87A, gif 87A as a file format,\nsupports the file compression and\n\n535\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.604\nreleasing, 256 color palette and\nusually is used for high level pictures,\n\n536\n00:25:47.604 --> 00:25:53.376\nlike pictures that you want to have\na good quality reproduction for.\n\n537\n00:25:53.376 --> 00:25:57.471\nAnd the Gif 89A properties are like\nbackground transparency, delay time, image\n\n538\n00:25:57.471 --> 00:26:01.790\nreplacement parameters, when you want to\nput multiple images together in a file.\n\n539\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.890\nThat's when you're often going to\nuse 89a as opposed to just one image\n\n540\n00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.100\nthat's going to be of a high quality.\n\n541\n00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.960\nSo, a little bit deeper on the gif there.\n\n542\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.370\nAlso a jpeg, I think I put a couple of\nthings in there specifically with regards\n\n543\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.230\nto the four phases that we use to\ndo file compression with jpeg.\n\n544\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.780\nProbably a good idea for you to know that.\n\n545\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.380\nRemember I did mention\nthat jpeg is a lossy or\n\n546\n00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.210\nan example of the lossy solution for\ncompression.\n\n547\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:29.000\nWe get rid of the redundancy,\nstreamlining and making smaller as we go.\n\n548\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.545\nSo we use lossy algorithms that allow\nus to do this, we divide the file into\n\n549\n00:26:34.545 --> 00:26:38.815\nblocks of eight by eight pixels and then\nwe manipulate those blocks and save them.\n\n550\n00:26:38.815 --> 00:26:43.258\nSo we then start playing or\nusing with and applying what's called\n\n551\n00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:47.640\na discrete cosine transformation,\na DCT for the entire block.\n\n552\n00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.456\nAnd that's how we then actually\ncompress and ultimately save.\n\n553\n00:26:50.456 --> 00:26:54.395\nWe then go through check the image\nquality, make sure that the compression\n\n554\n00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:58.720\nis accurate, and then we actually encode\nthat compression and we save the files.\n\n555\n00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.280\nThere is a multi step process we go\nthrough with jpegs and obviously we\n\n556\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.620\nunwind that go in the other way when\nwe actually try to look at those files.\n\n557\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.210\nThis is the stuff that goes on\nunder the hood behind the scenes,\n\n558\n00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.122\nthis is not necessarily\nstuff that you as a CHFI, or\n\n559\n00:27:13.122 --> 00:27:16.160\nyou as just an average\nordinarily human being.\n\n560\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.990\nWhatever we think about or know, but it\njust maybe stuff that comes in handy for\n\n561\n00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.920\nyou if you're ever gonna sit through and\n\n562\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.280\nperhaps answer questions at some point\nwith regards to some of this information.\n\n563\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.120\nSome of the minutia, in other words,\nthat may be valuable for you, right?\n\n564\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.570\nWith regards to bit map images, they're\ntypically black and white and/or color.\n\n565\n00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.080\nThey range all the way through.\n\n566\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.580\nBit maps, one bit per pixel, all\nthe way up to color, with 24-bit color,\n\n567\n00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.110\nwhich is 16.7 million colors.\n\n568\n00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:45.710\nAssociated with that image file, so we can\ngo anywhere from, literally old schooled\n\n569\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.000\nblack and white to modern bright and\nvibrant color rendering using bitmaps.\n\n570\n00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.370\nIt's a very elastic and\n\n571\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.900\nvery flexible file format so,\njust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n572\n00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.710\nThe bit map file contains\nfour distinct areas.\n\n573\n00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.140\nThe header, the RGB as in red,\ngreen, blue quad array.\n\n574\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.940\nIt's where we detail out the colors.\n\n575\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.710\nThe information header and\nthen the image data itself.\n\n576\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.530\nThese are the four areas that\nare gonna be in each bit map file and\n\n577\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.780\nI know we have those\ncaptured in our show notes.\n\n578\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.700\nAnd for tiff there are three\ndata structures specific to tiff\n\n579\n00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.900\nthat you wanna be aware of.\n\n580\n00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.430\nWe have an image file header,\nwhat's called the IFH,\n\n581\n00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.040\nwe have the image file directory,\n\n582\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.070\nwhat's called the IFD, and we have\nthe directory entry, what's called the DE.\n\n583\n00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.560\nThe IFH is an eight bit structure,\nit's at the offset, at the first offset or\n\n584\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.410\noffset zero in the file, so\nat the very beginning of the file.\n\n585\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.824\nIt contains information to interpret\nthe remainder of the file.\n\n586\n00:28:37.824 --> 00:28:41.339\nI demonstrated this though,\nnot with a TIF file for you but\n\n587\n00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:45.858\nin the last episode when we did the WINEX\nediting of the JPEG file we looked at\n\n588\n00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:48.328\nthe very first set of bits in the header.\n\n589\n00:28:48.328 --> 00:28:52.509\nAnd manipulated that to change the file\nformat and to not recognize the file we\n\n590\n00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:56.390\nwere essentially manipulating\ninformation in the image file header.\n\n591\n00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.030\nBut it was in the GIF or rather in\nthe JPEG files plus the TIF file.\n\n592\n00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.630\nSo, that concept we did illustrate for\nyou, but\n\n593\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.760\nwe did it in the Win Tex\neditor with the JPEG file.\n\n594\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.610\nBut it's the same idea.\n\n595\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.470\nManipulating that information would\nrender the file unusable because we don't\n\n596\n00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.540\nunderstand how to essentially format\nthe file and read it the right way.\n\n597\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.720\nAnd then putting it back, of course,\nallows us to see it, as we saw, which is\n\n598\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.180\nactually a very cool little interpretation\nof how you would do something like this.\n\n599\n00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.380\nI thought it was actually pretty neat\n\n600\n00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:21.990\nlittle-\n&gt;&gt; Very Cool.\n\n601\n00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.100\n&gt;&gt; examination of that.\n\n602\n00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.230\nImage file directory,\nthis is gonna have a listing for\n\n603\n00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.290\nthe number of directories that are going\nto be found inside of the image.\n\n604\n00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.200\nEach entry is typically 12 bits in size,\nit's very small.\n\n605\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.030\nIf you have more then one IFT Present,\nin other words, you have\n\n606\n00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.770\nmore than one directory listing, means\nyou have multiple images in the file.\n\n607\n00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.420\nIf you only have one,\nyou only have one image.\n\n608\n00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.910\nYou get one listing per image.\n\n609\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.150\nSo if you have multiple images,\nmultiple listings.\n\n610\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.340\nPretty straight forward and\nsimple concept.\n\n611\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.660\nAnd then the directory entry,\nthis is again 12 bytes in length,\n\n612\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.780\njust like the IFD is.\n\n613\n00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.500\nI would break that up and that tells\nus information about the actual data\n\n614\n00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.950\nof the file itself and then of course we\nhave the data associated with all that.\n\n615\n00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.550\nThat's gonna be in your tif files.\n\n616\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.080\nAnd then we had this idea,\nwe've talked about carving.\n\n617\n00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.610\nWhen we actually took a look\nat some of the prior episodes\n\n618\n00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.940\naround how to use N case and\n\n619\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:13.410\nI think specifically access FTK when we\nwent in the deep dive in that episode.\n\n620\n00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.510\nHow to use the tool, how to look at\nimages, how to carve images out.\n\n621\n00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.100\nOf an evidence file and reconstitute that.\n\n622\n00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.960\nAnd we talked about this idea of carving.\n\n623\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.770\nSometimes I also call it salvaging.\n\n624\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.400\nSalvaging collects and\nregenerates the images from\n\n625\n00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.510\ndifferent pieces of image files that are\nspread around different areas of the disk.\n\n626\n00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.900\nWhen we have dispersed data or\na disk that's been erased but\n\n627\n00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.300\nhas not been thoroughly erased and\nthere's remnant data.\n\n628\n00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.380\nWe may use salvaging to try to pull back\nthose bits and reconstitute an image.\n\n629\n00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.020\nCarving, we use the database and\nthe headers of the image files, and\n\n630\n00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.420\nthe footers associated with them,\n\n631\n00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.150\nto actually be able to reconstitute\nrecovery files from the raw disk image.\n\n632\n00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:54.735\nIf we create a DD image file of a drive,\nand we then go through and examine and\n\n633\n00:30:54.735 --> 00:30:59.335\nthen use a tool like access FDK to do\ncarving, we actually then are able to pull\n\n634\n00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:04.055\nin the, I was about to say the hooter,\nthe header and the footer.\n\n635\n00:31:04.055 --> 00:31:07.177\nThe header and footer information that's\ncontained in the Those image files.\n\n636\n00:31:07.177 --> 00:31:08.467\nAnd you saw what a header looked like,\n\n637\n00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:11.367\nI showed it to you in the last\nepisode with the WinHex editor.\n\n638\n00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:15.517\nWe can read that information based on that\nstring that tells us what file type it is,\n\n639\n00:31:15.517 --> 00:31:16.547\nwhat it should look like.\n\n640\n00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:19.237\nWe can actually begin to reconstitute\nit and rebuild the files.\n\n641\n00:31:19.237 --> 00:31:21.067\nWe can then see what those images are.\n\n642\n00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:23.290\nSo it's kind of an interesting thing.\n\n643\n00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.520\nBut salvaging and carving are two\ntechniques that are associated\n\n644\n00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.790\nwith steganography in\nterms of unwinding it and\n\n645\n00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.610\nbeing able to examine it from\na investigator perspective.\n\n646\n00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.790\nWanna make sure that we aware of that and,\nobviously, as I said and\n\n647\n00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.940\nwhat we talked about, seeing what's in\nthe header and reading image headers.\n\n648\n00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.610\nVery important for\nus to be able to do as well.\n\n649\n00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.635\nAnd you saw a practical\nexample in the last episode.\n\n650\n00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Shew, say that three times fast.\n\n651\n00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.640\nIt's a lot of information, I know.\n\n652\n00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.440\nYou probably feel like you're drinking\nfrom a fire hose at this point in time,\n\n653\n00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.570\nbut that's okay.\n\n654\n00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.220\nThe good thing is, we're recording this,\nyou can go back later.\n\n655\n00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.640\nWatch it as many times as necessary.\n\n656\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Did he hit the recording button?\n\n657\n00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.510\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n\n658\n00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.490\n&gt;&gt; He's out there waving at his friend.\n\n659\n00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.110\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; They missed the whole thing.\n\n660\n00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.350\n&gt;&gt; Can you do that all again?\n\n661\n00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just from the top.\n\n662\n00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.180\n&gt;&gt; Same way you did it, same order.\n\n663\n00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.610\nBut that being said, you can,\nyou should be able to go back and\n\n664\n00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:12.120\nwatch this as many times as\nnecessary to bury it in the brain.\n\n665\n00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.770\nWe always like to say, repetition\nbreeds retention into your mind.\n\n666\n00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.040\nSo that is good thing.\n\n667\n00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Or beats it into your mind.\n\n668\n00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.450\n&gt;&gt; A lot of information when\nit comes to steganography,\n\n669\n00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.990\na lot of different ways\nin which it can be done.\n\n670\n00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:29.550\nWe've looked at the, obviously audio and\nvideo, as well as image.\n\n671\n00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.190\nBasically a lot of places where\nthere's any kind of slack space\n\n672\n00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.060\nis a really good place to hide data into.\n\n673\n00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.500\nSo be on the lookout for that.\n\n674\n00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.140\nLearn the minutiae that Adam has so\ngraciously expounded upon and\n\n675\n00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.750\ndelivered to our little brains that we\nmight learn it and know it ourselves and\n\n676\n00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.960\nbe masters of it.\n\n677\n00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.930\nAdam, we appreciate it.\n\n678\n00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:55.410\nIt was a lot, but you masterfully executed\nthat for us but I'm looking at our clock.\n\n679\n00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.550\nWe've expired a little more of\nthe time than we'd like to, so\n\n680\n00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.040\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for today.\n\n681\n00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.710\nWe do thank you guys for joining us\ntoday and thanks for watching, but\n\n682\n00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.910\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n683\n00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.930\nFor IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n684\n00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.766\n&gt;&gt; I'm a stegenographically modified image\nwho is not gonna tell you what it is?\n\n685\n00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:15.251\nBut if you can can figure out,\nthere is a USB drive and that for you.\n\n686\n00:33:15.251 --> 00:33:18.276\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:33:18.276 --> 00:33:24.109\n[MUSIC]\n\n688\n00:33:24.109 --> 00:33:27.394\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:13.026\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.994\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.741\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.995\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.242\nAnd of course, it wouldn't be CHFI if\nwe didn't have our good friend, Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.547\nAdam Gordon,\nback in the studio again with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:30.987\nAdam, welcome back and how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:33.432\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nWhat would it be if it wasn't CHFI?\n\n11\n00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.897\nIt might be, I don't know, something else.\n\n12\n00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:37.337\nWhatever that might be.\n\n13\n00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.247\nSo it is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.110\nHopefully it's going well for all of you.\n\n15\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.350\nWe're gonna speak a little bit today in\nthis episode here, right here, right now.\n\n16\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.050\nRemember Jesus Jones, 1980s?\n\n17\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.940\n&gt;&gt; Right Here, yes.\n\n18\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Right Here, Right Now.\n\n19\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we don't just do\nmovie trivia here at ITProTV.\n\n21\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.290\n&gt;&gt; We are music buffs as well.\n\n22\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.710\n&gt;&gt; We do bad 80s music video trivia,\nthat's coming up later today.\n\n23\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.070\nSo, actually, you know what,\nthis is our random aside, by the way.\n\n24\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.250\nSo total random,\nnot have anything to do with videos, or\n\n25\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.000\nrather with movies but rather with music.\n\n26\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.350\nDo you know what the number one\ngrossing song in terms of ad revenue,\n\n27\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.950\nlike being used after the fact for ads,\nand background music and stuff in TV is?\n\n28\n00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.615\nYou will be shocked when\nI tell you who it is.\n\n29\n00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.840\n&gt;&gt; Number one song of all time\nas in a background music item-\n\n30\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.670\n&gt;&gt; On a yearly basis,\n\n31\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.430\ngrossing year after year,\nsince it was actually performed.\n\n32\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.800\n&gt;&gt; I want to say it's a Foreigner tune or\nsomething.\n\n33\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.940\n&gt;&gt; No, no, believe it or not.\n\n34\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.860\n&gt;&gt; You remember Katrina and\nthe Waves, Walking on Sunshine?\n\n35\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, are you serious?\n\n36\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Year over year, that thing grosses\nsomething like 20 million a year.\n\n37\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.170\n&gt;&gt; You have got to be kidding me.\n\n38\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.640\n&gt;&gt; Since they recorded it,\nnumber one grossing song.\n\n39\n00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.230\n&gt;&gt; I've always said,\nI just want one number one hit.\n\n40\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.240\nAnd that could be a one-hit wonder,\nI'm happy with that.\n\n41\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.080\n&gt;&gt; You just need that one thing,\nbut you're just,\n\n42\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.040\nit has to be that thing, whatever that is.\n\n43\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gotta do it.\n\n44\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.697\n&gt;&gt; But that's apparently the number one,\nbased on reuse revenue,\n\n45\n00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:54.350\njust ad generated or\nwhatever after the fact.\n\n46\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.750\nNumber one song year over year\nsince they've recorded it.\n\n47\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.535\n&gt;&gt; There's your useless bar trivia and\nquestion, answer for the day.\n\n48\n00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:02.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing what I actually know\n\n49\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.750\nthat has nothing to do with\nwhat I'm supposed to know.\n\n50\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.680\nIf I could bottle all that, I would have\na book and I could then stop doing this.\n\n51\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.110\nAnd I could actually do other stuff,\nit would work out well.\n\n52\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, let's talk about\nwhat we're here to talk about.\n\n53\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.430\nSo, passwords, password cracking, you\nshould do that if you're an investigator,\n\n54\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.750\nthat's what we want to tell you.\n\n55\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.110\nSo, when we think about being involved\nin security, and we've talked\n\n56\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370\nabout this in some of our other episodes,\nthis linkage to other knowledge.\n\n57\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.470\nWe said hey, CEH, great prerequisite\nknowledge, would be good for\n\n58\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.590\nus to know how to potentially use those\nhacking skills as an investigator.\n\n59\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.550\nBe aware of some of\nthe things that the bad\n\n60\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.730\nactors are gonna do because it makes us\nbetter at interpreting the warning signs.\n\n61\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.150\nAnd we've talked about some of the logic,\nthe thought process of that.\n\n62\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.520\nThe idea here is really\nessentially building on that.\n\n63\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.390\nWhen we think about using passwords\nto protect sensitive information,\n\n64\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.150\npretty common everybody does that.\n\n65\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.710\nAcceptable behavior we should do that.\n\n66\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.832\nWe're not really worried about hey,\n\n67\n00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:05.810\ndo you had a password,\nwe're not worry about did you use one.\n\n68\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.560\nWe are clearly worried about it's strong\nenough to protect the information.\n\n69\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.930\nBut, the reality is as investigators,\nwe wanna be able to crack those passwords.\n\n70\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.860\nWe wanna get into the material\nthat you may have protected, and\n\n71\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.740\nwe need to be able to\nunderstand what's there.\n\n72\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.670\nSo in effect,\nwe almost have to act like hackers.\n\n73\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.180\nNot almost, let's be unequivocal, we have\nto in this respect, act like a hacker.\n\n74\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.320\nWe have to use the tools hackers use.\n\n75\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.010\nWe have to think about\nthe concepts the same way.\n\n76\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.940\nBecause a lot of times bad actors will\nprotect the information that they don't\n\n77\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.430\nwant anybody else to see by using\nthe same methods, the same techniques,\n\n78\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.730\nthe same thought processes that good\npeople do to protect information,\n\n79\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.750\nto provide confidentiality.\n\n80\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.020\nNumber one way we do this,\n\n81\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.260\nencrypt data, use strong complex passwords\nthat are gonna be very difficult to guess.\n\n82\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.610\nAnd so\nif we follow this logic as investigators,\n\n83\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.070\nwe've got to be prepared to do battle.\n\n84\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.760\nWe've got to be prepared to figure\nout what those complex passwords are.\n\n85\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.970\nWe've got to be prepared to do the things\nthat we need to do to figure this out.\n\n86\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.420\nBecomes very, very important.\n\n87\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.130\nWhen we think about password types,\nwhat types of passwords can we have,\n\n88\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.328\nwhat form do they take.\n\n89\n00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:21.630\nSo Daniel, as we often do,\nlet's play a game.\n\n90\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.760\nSo, when we think about password types,\nand I say hey,\n\n91\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.205\nhow many types of passwords are there?\n\n92\n00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:28.510\nWell, what would you think,\nwhat comes to mind?\n\n93\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Types of passwords.\n\n94\n00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Types of passwords.\n\n95\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.520\nAnd it's an unobvious question,\nlet me be fair.\n\n96\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm almost setting Daniel up\n\n97\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.875\nfor failure by saying that.\n\n98\n00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.930\nCuz you don't really have a point\nof reference for that, so\n\n99\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.030\nlet me be a little bit clearer.\n\n100\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.312\nCuz that's probably not a great\nway to ask the question.\n\n101\n00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:48.969\nWhen I think about password types,\nwhat I'm actually wanting Daniel to think\n\n102\n00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.578\nabout and\nwhat we wanna discuss with you is,\n\n103\n00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:54.610\nis there a way which passwords\ncan be presented, so\n\n104\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.867\nin other words passwords could\nliterally be written down in the clear.\n\n105\n00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:02.966\nSo we have what we call clear text\npasswords, they're there, they're\n\n106\n00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:07.665\neffective, we use them, but you wrote them\ndown, and if I find the piece of paper,\n\n107\n00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:11.320\nand it says the password is,\nxyz that's a clear text password.\n\n108\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.850\nCan we hide our passwords\nessentually through various forms?\n\n109\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe see that when you log into a website.\n\n110\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.410\nYou type in your password, and there's\ndots instead of the actual characters.\n\n111\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.970\n&gt;&gt; We call those obfuscate,\nthey're essential hidden.\n\n112\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.140\nThey are there, but\nwe're not exposing them,\n\n113\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.580\nwe're In some way preventing you\nfrom seeing them on the screen,\n\n114\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.730\nDaniel, as he said the classic\nway the asterisk that show up.\n\n115\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.484\nNow think about this for\na minute, so interesting,\n\n116\n00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:40.116\nlets bring a little hardware knowledge, a\nlittle, a-plus hardware slash entry level\n\n117\n00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:44.760\nsecurity 101 hacking conversation into\nthe password cracking discussion.\n\n118\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.370\nSo we obfuscate the password on\nthe screen, you type it in and\n\n119\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.190\nthe password is pass123 but\nyou see such seven asterisks.\n\n120\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.870\nNow, could we actually\ntell what's on the screen?\n\n121\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.160\nWe can't see it so we don't know,\nwe'd have to guess but is there a way for\n\n122\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.400\nus to unequivocally know\nwhat that password would be?\n\n123\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.972\nWe could use hardware or\nsoftware cuz these concepts,\n\n124\n00:06:05.972 --> 00:06:09.390\nor rather this hacking tool I'm\nthinking of, exists in both forms.\n\n125\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.000\nBut we could use something\nlike a keylogger, and\n\n126\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.850\npotentially run a hardware or\nsoftware on the system.\n\n127\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.130\nAnd we would be capturing\nthe keystrokes from the keyboard,\n\n128\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.160\nthe electronic impulses that\nare pushed through the system.\n\n129\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.290\nSo on the screen you would see asterisk,\nbut what we would see in the output file\n\n130\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.910\nwould actually be pass1234 or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n131\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.840\nAnd so we could get obfuscated passwords\nif we have the right software or hardware,\n\n132\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.910\nand we had set the system up in such a way\nthat although you may not know this,\n\n133\n00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.980\nwe would be capturing all the keystrokes\nso we could easily do that.\n\n134\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.830\nSo we have cleartext, we have obfuscated,\nwhat about passwords in another form?\n\n135\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.610\nSo aside from what do we call them,\nasterisks, just them out so to speak.\n\n136\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.530\nIs there another way?\n\n137\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.100\nMaybe a way that we could\ncryptographically represent a password,\n\n138\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.760\nbut it wouldn't necessarily\nbe the password.\n\n139\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think of the san files\ninside of Windows machines,\n\n140\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.340\nthere's the shadow file inside\nof a Unix and Linux as well.\n\n141\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.950\n&gt;&gt; Or etc/shadow, right,\netc/passwd, etc/shadow.\n\n142\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.470\nSo what Daniel's describing or referring\nto is the way we actually store those.\n\n143\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.995\nHe's named, essentially, the mechanisms\nthe place and the thought process behind\n\n144\n00:07:16.995 --> 00:07:19.665\nit, but what we're doing is\nwe're hashing those passwords.\n\n145\n00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:23.175\nWe're storing them in a hashed form and\nso we have different\n\n146\n00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:27.085\ntypes of passwords that could exist\nessentially, in different formats.\n\n147\n00:07:27.085 --> 00:07:31.417\nHowever passwords exist, the idea is\nthat we wanna be able to capture them.\n\n148\n00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:36.557\nIf I give you a password hash, there\nshould be a way, in theory there is a way,\n\n149\n00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:39.957\nwhether you can execute on it or\nnot is obviously is up to you.\n\n150\n00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:44.157\nBut there's a way for you to take that\nhash and tell what the password is.\n\n151\n00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:46.827\nWe're gonna take a look at what you can\ndo with that and how you can do that.\n\n152\n00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:49.150\nWe would call that a rainbow table attack.\n\n153\n00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.280\nWere rainbow table crack,\nwere we could know what the password is,\n\n154\n00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.190\nbut not really know it.\n\n155\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.985\nWhat we know is the cryptographic\nrepresentation of the password,\n\n156\n00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:57.920\nwhat we call the hash.\n\n157\n00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.919\nAnd we talked about hashing in some of\nour earlier discussions in episodes.\n\n158\n00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.777\nWe showed you how hashing works.\n\n159\n00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:07.935\nIf you don't remember that or you haven't\nseen that, invite you to go back and\n\n160\n00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:09.370\ntake a look at that.\n\n161\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.350\nWe used the tool called HashCalc,\nI believe, and we actually demonstrated\n\n162\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.880\nthe way we can hash either a string or\na file, and represent that, and\n\n163\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.440\nthen use that hash as an integrity\nmechanism, right, to check the validity of\n\n164\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.110\nthe data, make sure the data has not\nbeen compromised or modified in any way.\n\n165\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.810\nWe can turn that around a little bit,\ntake a password and hash it.\n\n166\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.310\nUse the hash in lieu of the password.\n\n167\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.502\nWhat Daniel was describing\nwith the SAM file, right?\n\n168\n00:08:34.502 --> 00:08:39.112\nThe SAM hive, the SAM hive or\nthe shadow or password file in Linux.\n\n169\n00:08:39.112 --> 00:08:42.900\nAnd restore the password,\nnot as a password, but rather as a hash,\n\n170\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.640\na cryptographic representation.\n\n171\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.020\nWe could then transmit that hash back and\n\n172\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.850\nforth representing the password during\nlog-on without exposing it directly.\n\n173\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.660\nAnd this is how earlier\nversions of authentication, LM,\n\n174\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.440\nLAN Manager, NTLM, and\nWindows NT LAN Manager worked.\n\n175\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.890\nYou would send the hash of\nthe username and the password.\n\n176\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.390\nAnd we could then represent\nthe user that way.\n\n177\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.530\nAnd so, we can certainly do that,\nand we still do that today.\n\n178\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.170\nBut the challenge, of course is if we\nget the hash, and we then can compute\n\n179\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.040\nwhat that hash is, or reverse engineer the\nhash, we essentially have the password.\n\n180\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.090\nAnd so, we're gonna take a look at\nsome of the ways that may work and\n\n181\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.570\nsome of the things that go on there.\n\n182\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.640\nBut password-cracking is really the idea,\nthe art,\n\n183\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.960\nthe science, of figuring out\nhow to take an obfuscated, or\n\n184\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.330\na hash password, and convert it\ninto something we can use, right?\n\n185\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.510\nSo this is what we wanna do,\n\n186\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.380\nand what we're gonna take a look at and\nhow we're gonna do this.\n\n187\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.570\n&gt;&gt; And interestingly enough, before\nwe get into cracking those passwords,\n\n188\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.020\nsometimes you can actually just\npass the hash value to the machine.\n\n189\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.210\nAnd it will say,\nyes that's the correct hash value, so\n\n190\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.850\nI will allow you access as well.\n\n191\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.710\nIt's called passing the hash.\n\n192\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.710\nA nice little hacking technique for\nbreaking into systems.\n\n193\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.980\nBut if that doesn't work, we're stuck\nwith having to crack that sucker.\n\n194\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.620\n&gt;&gt; We are, and it's a question of how\nauthentication works on the system.\n\n195\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.280\nAnd then, essentially, how either the\npassword authentication in the application\n\n196\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.220\nor in the operating system.\n\n197\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.300\nSo you have different levels depending\non what we're talking about,\n\n198\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.530\nis designed to work.\n\n199\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.510\nBut ultimately, it really may be nothing\nmore than having the right sequence\n\n200\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.160\nof letters and numbers, essentially\nwhat hash is, an alpha numeric string.\n\n201\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.950\nIf we could sequence it the right way,\n\n202\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.210\nwe may never have to\nactually know what it is.\n\n203\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.070\nTo Daniel's point, we may never\nhave to actually decode the hash.\n\n204\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.470\nWe just may need to present it in\nthe right form in order to be able to\n\n205\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.530\nauthenticate.\n\n206\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.950\nThis is one of the reasons that we'll use\nsingle-session keys, and we use what's\n\n207\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.420\ncalled the anti-replay technology in\nwebsites more often than not these days.\n\n208\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.700\nWhere you authenticate,\nwe generate a single-session key and\n\n209\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.300\na hash to represent that.\n\n210\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.680\nBut you can't reuse that, right?\n\n211\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.280\nIn other words,\nif you try to show up and say hey,\n\n212\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.110\nI was here an hour ago,\nremember me, right?\n\n213\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.260\nI'd like to reconnect to me session,\nplease.\n\n214\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.040\nHere is my ID,\nthe website's gonna go who are you, right?\n\n215\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.280\nI have no knowledge of you.\n\n216\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.260\nI only remember people when\nthey come in one time and\n\n217\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.880\nwhile their actively connected.\n\n218\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.360\nOnce they go away,\nI don't remember who you are.\n\n219\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Short term memory loss.\n\n220\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, short term memory.\n\n221\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.860\nIt would be kind of interesting if you\nwent through life that way, right?\n\n222\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.650\nBut would present some unique challenges,\n\n223\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.039\nespecially if you were married or\nhad kids, right?\n\n224\n00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.168\nThat kind of thing.\nBut if you think the logic of it,\n\n225\n00:11:15.168 --> 00:11:18.830\nit makes perfectly good sense\nin what we're talking about.\n\n226\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.566\nBecause if we don't allow the reuse of\na credential, we eliminate on of the most\n\n227\n00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:27.575\nlikely pathways for hackers to engage and\nget into the system.\n\n228\n00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:30.622\nI can steal the credential,\nI can impersonate that user,\n\n229\n00:11:30.622 --> 00:11:33.621\nthat service account,\nthat session, whatever its is.\n\n230\n00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:37.934\nWe called these man in the middle attacks,\nor replay attacks, spoofing, masquerading,\n\n231\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:40.060\nit's a variety of terms we use for them.\n\n232\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.290\nBut the way we defend against them is\nby using essentially throw away keys,\n\n233\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.000\nsingle use one time keys.\n\n234\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.500\nDon't allow reuse, and as a result,\nbecause we have unique values,\n\n235\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.480\nunless you show up with a brand new\nunique value, you're not getting back in.\n\n236\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.600\nAnd the unique value must be one that\nwe have generated in the system and\n\n237\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.440\nare authorizing and signifying as\nlegitimate through the use of unique\n\n238\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.410\nidentifiers and the key stream and things\nlike that so that we know what it will be.\n\n239\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.560\nAnd so, it's a very important thing for\nus to think about and to be aware of.\n\n240\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.505\nIt's a little bit more on\nthe hacking side, right?\n\n241\n00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:13.730\nMoreso than on the investigative side,\n\n242\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.020\nbecause we're not really worried\nnecessarily about hey, can you break in\n\n243\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:23.180\nto a website and\nreuse a key as an investigator upfront.\n\n244\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.120\nThis is something that a security\nprofessional would focus on initially.\n\n245\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.400\nWe would architect, hopefully,\n\n246\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.400\nthe solution in such a way that\nwe would prevent that behavior.\n\n247\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.300\nIf after the fact,\nwhen we investigate, we find out we\n\n248\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.580\ndidn't implement the solution\narchitecture properly, and as a result,\n\n249\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.130\nwe did allow weakness to occur, then it\nbecomes our issue as an investigator.\n\n250\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.190\nWe have to look at it,\n\n251\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.060\nhave to help to diagnose it, have to talk\nto the enterprise security architect, or\n\n252\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.460\nthe security professional, and work\nwith them to diagnose what went wrong.\n\n253\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.920\nBut we're not gonna proactively look at\nthat stuff up front as an investigator.\n\n254\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.350\nWe're gonna deal with it on the back end.\n\n255\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.010\nSo, it's really important for\nus to know about, but\n\n256\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.750\nit may not be something\nwe touch all the time.\n\n257\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.200\nAs a matter a fact, if the security\nprofessional does their job the right way,\n\n258\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.520\nwe may never actually have to deal with\nthat outcome at all as an investigator.\n\n259\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.860\nBecause we never see it happen\n\n260\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.090\nif we actually set up of\nauthentication the right way.\n\n261\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.700\nAnd so, speaking of setting up\nauthentication, let us take a look.\n\n262\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.550\nAnd we really gotta find a way to\nmirror that so when I do this,\n\n263\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.340\nit actually winds out doing this.\n\n264\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.960\nAnd it does this.\n\n265\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.068\nSee, I got it right this time-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n266\n00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:22.970\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It does that.\n\n267\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.290\nAnd so, if I do that,\nmaybe I just start doing that.\n\n268\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.092\nAnd if I do that,\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n269\n00:13:27.092 --> 00:13:29.960\nSo, let us, wait, wait,\nnow I gotta figure out which way, right?\n\n270\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.520\nLet us, nope that way.\n\n271\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.607\nLet us do this.\n\n272\n00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:34.740\nThat's kind of the same thing.\n\n273\n00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.940\nThat's really an awkward movement,\nthough, I don't know if I like that.\n\n274\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.396\nI think I'm gonna stick with this, so\nwe'll just do this and go that way.\n\n275\n00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.790\nAnyway, all right, so\nlet's take a look in here, and\n\n276\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.450\nlet's figure out a little\nbit about password cracking.\n\n277\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.740\nSo, what I thought we would do by\nway of taking a loot at this is\n\n278\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.460\nstart with some basic information.\n\n279\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.686\nI wanna show you a couple\nof interesting things,\n\n280\n00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:55.042\nfew websites that may be\nhave been interest to you.\n\n281\n00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.980\nI wanna also show you one of the tools\nwe often use, an oldie but a goodie.\n\n282\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.060\nA tool called L0phtCrack,\na lot of you probably heard of.\n\n283\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.750\nIt's pretty cool tool.\n\n284\n00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.450\nUsed to be owned and put out by\nan entity called Lopht Heavy Industries.\n\n285\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.488\nThey got bought out.\n\n286\n00:14:08.488 --> 00:14:13.850\nAnd it has now kind of been buried,\nso to speak, really tough to find.\n\n287\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.600\nThere's an off put, or rather an alternate\nversion called OphCrack that you can use.\n\n288\n00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.730\nBut there's a series of tools out\nthere that are kind of interesting.\n\n289\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.990\nWe're also gonna take a look\nat how to hack a PDF and\n\n290\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.130\npull a password out of that,\nmake that short work of that.\n\n291\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.630\nYou can do this with Word documents,\nspreadsheets,\n\n292\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.450\nthe common stuff that we\nwould often be investigating\n\n293\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.530\nwhere we have a lot of documents and\nwe wanna be able to look at them.\n\n294\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.540\nThat's kinda the daily grind for\nthe investigator, right?\n\n295\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.550\nIt's not so much, hey, let's capture that\nencrypted network traffic in real time and\n\n296\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.150\nlook at it.\n\n297\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.890\nA lot of times, remember,\nit's gonna be evidence that's\n\n298\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.630\neither dynamic in real time sitting in\na single machine that we can go after.\n\n299\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.970\nWe talked a lot about how to capture that,\nwhat to do with that,\n\n300\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.820\nhow to make short order of that and\nthen to analyse it offline.\n\n301\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.230\nAnd we've also talked a lot about\nhow do we capture the static data,\n\n302\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.150\nthe data that's sitting in the hard drive.\n\n303\n00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.850\nWe're gonna take a look at, and certainly\ntalk about things like log capturing, and\n\n304\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.080\njust making sure we are comfortable\nwith what's in logs, and\n\n305\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.380\neven look at some real time network\nmonitoring where we might want to\n\n306\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.920\nmonitor traffic or use a tool,\nwhether it's wireshark,\n\n307\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.890\nor it's network analyzer, whatever it may\nbe, we can do some of that in real time.\n\n308\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:27.260\nThere is always a component of that,\nbut the reality is most of what we do,\n\n309\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.070\nand most of what we look at is gonna\nbe static data sitting on one or\n\n310\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.030\nmore system drives that we're then gonna\nhave access to and analyze offline.\n\n311\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.220\nAnd so, as a result, we are gonna spend\na lot of time looking at documents,\n\n312\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.630\nspend a lot of time looking at pictures.\n\n313\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.910\nWe did an interesting episode\naround steganography, right?\n\n314\n00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.180\nAnd we showed you, if you haven't\nseen that one, good idea for\n\n315\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.350\nyou to go back, take a look.\n\n316\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.250\nShowed you how to hide data inside of\na picture, showed you how to find out that\n\n317\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.032\na picture has been modified with\nsteganography, explain some of the tools\n\n318\n00:15:57.032 --> 00:16:00.777\nof the craft and trade, so to speak,\nabout how we detect steganography.\n\n319\n00:16:00.777 --> 00:16:03.662\nSo we've done a lot of those kind\nof things in other episodes, and\n\n320\n00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:05.924\nwe're gonna just kinda\ncontinue that theme here.\n\n321\n00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:10.361\nSo let's start by doing the following,\nlet me just open up,\n\n322\n00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:14.700\nthere it is right there,\njust kind of get down to it.\n\n323\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.430\nLet me open up our browser,\nlet's take a look at a couple of things.\n\n324\n00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.130\nNow, one of the ideas that I\nwant to share with you here and\n\n325\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.060\nI'm just going to show you.\n\n326\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.810\nYou'll like we always do,\nor at least try to do.\n\n327\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.130\nWent ahead and did a Google search,\n\n328\n00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.510\njust to give you some idea of how to find\nsome of these things where they are.\n\n329\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.630\nAnd without focusing on one or\nmore of them in particular,\n\n330\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.320\ngiving you a sense of where to\ngo do some research, right?\n\n331\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.590\nWe're gonna talk about dictionary\nlists and why they're so\n\n332\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.500\nimportant in password cracking when I\nshow you how to do this in just a minute.\n\n333\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.860\nBut I wanna just set the idea up for\nyou, right?\n\n334\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.360\nSo, when we think about a dictionary\n\n335\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.270\nwe think about the ability to be able to\ngo and look something up literally, right?\n\n336\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.190\nList of words if you think about\nwhat a dictionary essentially is,\n\n337\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.240\nwith definitions.\n\n338\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.970\nUsually in alphabetical order.\n\n339\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.680\nAnd we can then use those words and\nthe representation,\n\n340\n00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.020\nthe definition of the word to\nunderstand something better.\n\n341\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.000\nTo build meaning.\n\n342\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.660\nAnd by extension,\nto then use language properly.\n\n343\n00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.210\nOr use language correctly.\n\n344\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.740\nOr to say the things that we're looking\nto say in a way that makes sense that\n\n345\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.160\ncommunicates not only interest and\nimportance but meaning to others, right?\n\n346\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.505\nSo we can essentially tell people what\nwe wanna do and how we want to do it.\n\n347\n00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:24.815\nDictionary lists are the same concepts.\n\n348\n00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:28.845\nBut we strip away the definition,\nwhat we really want as an investigator,\n\n349\n00:17:28.845 --> 00:17:31.605\nas security professional,\neven as a bad actor.\n\n350\n00:17:31.605 --> 00:17:32.737\nIf we are looking to hack,\n\n351\n00:17:32.737 --> 00:17:35.235\ncuz remember,this tool can\nbe used either way, right.\n\n352\n00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:39.615\nThe bad actor, the ethical or unethical\nhacker is gonna use the password cracking\n\n353\n00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:43.435\ntool to crack passwords and\nlook at information without permission.\n\n354\n00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:46.180\nThe investigator is gonna do\nthat to look at information.\n\n355\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.180\nAnd essentially you could think\nof it as looking at it more or\n\n356\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.180\nless without permission.\n\n357\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.110\nIn the sense that we are cracking it.\n\n358\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.220\nWhat were doing so typically at\nthe behalf of law enforcement or\n\n359\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.630\nat the behalf of the system owner to\nunderstand what may have gone wrong.\n\n360\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.640\nBut let's be honest, we're essentially\nstill cracking the system, right?\n\n361\n00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.690\nSo, we're breaking in.\n\n362\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:07.410\nBut we're doing so with the required\npermission and understanding\n\n363\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.370\nof the owner or at least somebody who\ncan give us the authority to do that.\n\n364\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.460\nBut we need to get a dictionary list,\nand dictionary lists are interesting.\n\n365\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.540\nBack in the day, which for\nme was over 30 years, but\n\n366\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.740\nback in the day when I've been\ndoing this over the years.\n\n367\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.920\nWe still do, I still do, many of us still\ndo make up our own dictionary lists.\n\n368\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.110\nYou can find pre-compiled ones,\nthat's kinda what this is showing us.\n\n369\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.840\nYou could go down this list, and\nyou'll see there's all sorts of ones here.\n\n370\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.280\nAnd you can download Large Password List,\nfree download for dictionary file, right?\n\n371\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.450\nSkullSecurity, got a password list there,\nthat's a good one.\n\n372\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.030\nYou always like to go\na website that implies\n\n373\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.790\nthat they have the Ghostrider\nthing going on, SkullSecurity.\n\n374\n00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.297\n&gt;&gt; I've actually been to that website.\n\n375\n00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:50.360\nThey have a fantastic group of\npassword lists there [LAUGH].\n\n376\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.380\n&gt;&gt; CrackStation, another really good one.\n\n377\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.460\nI'll show you the CrackStation\nsite in a minute.\n\n378\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.390\nThere is all of these different\nsites where you could get your own.\n\n379\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.230\nI used to build my own I still do\nyou got list of like crazy stuff.\n\n380\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.510\nCuz you never know what people\nare gonna use as passwords what you're\n\n381\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.700\ngonna have to represent.\n\n382\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.310\nPlace names, countries,\nyour 80s movie stars.\n\n383\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.640\nI mean there're themes that come up.\n\n384\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.550\nSo at one point bottles of wine like names\nof old bottles of wines were popular.\n\n385\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.190\nThe ever present stuff like pornstar\nnames are always a good bet,\n\n386\n00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.000\nyou can always find those.\n\n387\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.932\nI remember at one point there\nwas this station I worked on and\n\n388\n00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:31.173\nwe wound up having to use,\nit was a foreign language\n\n389\n00:19:31.173 --> 00:19:35.238\nI am just trying to remember\nexactly what it was.\n\n390\n00:19:35.238 --> 00:19:39.530\nIt was something like, it was a foreign\nlanguage and then it was translated into\n\n391\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.477\nanother language so\nyou had to have the original word,\n\n392\n00:19:42.477 --> 00:19:45.552\nthen you had to have the meaning\nin another language, and\n\n393\n00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:48.710\nthen ultimately you then had\nto use that as a derivative.\n\n394\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:53.150\nSo it was kinda complicated stuff, but you\nfind all these different password lists\n\n395\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.660\nand not just in English,\nby the way, right?\n\n396\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.970\nBecause remember while we often,\nif we're based in the United States or\n\n397\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.780\nin a country that, English is a primary\nlanguage in, may think that way.\n\n398\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.200\nThere are many many of us that live in\ncountries where English is not spoken as\n\n399\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.300\na primary language.\n\n400\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.070\nAnd there is software generated and used\nin other languages other than English.\n\n401\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.570\nAnd as a result,\nyou may need passwords in French.\n\n402\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.680\nYou may need them in German or\nChinese or whatever the case may be.\n\n403\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.090\nAnd you could find those lists and\n\n404\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.230\nyou could find software that will\ncrack passwords in those languages.\n\n405\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.630\nSo you have to understand and think\nabout the logic of some of this stuff.\n\n406\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.750\nSo when we go, we look for\na dictionary list.\n\n407\n00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.250\nWhoops.\n\n408\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.220\nWe can go to a site like this, right?\n\n409\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.260\nSo CrackStation,\nSkull Candy, whatever it is.\n\n410\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.640\nYou'll see here that the main password\ndictionary list has over one billion,\n\n411\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.500\nalmost one and a half billion words in it,\nit's roughly 15 gigs.\n\n412\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.560\nNot too big to download, but sizeable,\nyou would load that up into a cracking\n\n413\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.710\nprogram, and you would then be able to\ngo through, run the password, and, or\n\n414\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.740\nthe hashes against that, trying to\nfigure out if you have an understanding.\n\n415\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.785\nNow, In this case\na cracking dictionary for\n\n416\n00:20:57.785 --> 00:21:00.875\npasswords is actually\ngonna be words not hashes.\n\n417\n00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:04.788\nWhen we wanna get hashes and we wanna get\na list of hashes, we get what's called\n\n418\n00:21:04.788 --> 00:21:08.192\na hash list or more formally commonly\nreferred to as rainbow table.\n\n419\n00:21:08.192 --> 00:21:10.684\nAnd we're gonna take a look at how\nto download those as well, but\n\n420\n00:21:10.684 --> 00:21:12.957\nwe're gonna go out and\nget a pre-compiled list of those.\n\n421\n00:21:12.957 --> 00:21:15.977\nSo you would go download one or\nmore of these.\n\n422\n00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:19.097\nThe thing you have to remember\nabout these sites is that,\n\n423\n00:21:19.097 --> 00:21:21.527\nwhile a lot of them that\nwill come up are legitimate,\n\n424\n00:21:21.527 --> 00:21:25.407\nyou have to be concerned a little bit, a\nlittle bit wary, about the fact that some\n\n425\n00:21:25.407 --> 00:21:29.830\nof these sites may have, because they\nverge towards the darker side of the web.\n\n426\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:34.900\nSo, you may be dealing with hacker sites\nas opposed to more legitimate sites.\n\n427\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's put it that way.\n\n428\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.470\nAnd as a result, you just have to be\ncareful where you go, careful what you do.\n\n429\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.200\nYou should be running anti-malware,\nantivirus software, and\n\n430\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.030\nwhatever system you would connect out.\n\n431\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.760\nTo do this you have to scan constantly\nbecause you may be being set up so\n\n432\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.290\nto speak to download something\nthat looks legitimate but\n\n433\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.960\nwill infect you with malware.\n\n434\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400\nSo the Daniels of the world,\n\n435\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.480\nright, that have the shell code exploit\nthat we talked about in a prior show.\n\n436\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Just go to this website.\n\n437\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.940\n&gt;&gt; May actually just output\nsomething there for you and\n\n438\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.380\nlegitimately they could have set up\nwhat we call a trojan horse, right?\n\n439\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.320\nSo they would've given you a password\nlist that is legitimate, but\n\n440\n00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.090\nof course on the flip side, will do\nsomething you're not so excited about.\n\n441\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.520\nSo you just gotta exercise\na little bit of caution and\n\n442\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.870\nwe don't want to underplay that concept.\n\n443\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.030\nHaven't really spoken much about it.\n\n444\n00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.790\nIt's a theme in many of\nour episodes up until now.\n\n445\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.340\nWe talk extensively about that\nconcept in hacking classes.\n\n446\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.432\nAnd so for instance, things like CEH where\nwe speak a lot about the fact that you\n\n447\n00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:32.104\nhave to be very weary of where you go and\nwhat you do.\n\n448\n00:22:32.104 --> 00:22:35.754\nYou always, as an investigator, we want\nyou to have that thought process that,\n\n449\n00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:38.167\nhey, I have to go out there,\nI have to look, act, and\n\n450\n00:22:38.167 --> 00:22:41.020\nfeel like the hacker to\nunderstand what they're doing.\n\n451\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.780\nBut with that, you know, they often say,\n\n452\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.040\nwith great power comes great\nresponsibility, right?\n\n453\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.810\nSo another classic line from Big Bang.\n\n454\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.190\nRemember that episode where Sheldon and\n\n455\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:55.200\nPenny kinda go at it head to head, because\nSheldon is trying to do his laundry?\n\n456\n00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And Penny says,\n\n457\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.390\nokay, sorry,\nessentially screws up his laundry thing.\n\n458\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I remember this.\n\n459\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.010\nAnd so she winds up, they go head to head.\n\n460\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.985\nHe winds up putting her\nlaundry out on the power line.\n\n461\n00:23:04.985 --> 00:23:06.473\nAnd then she can't get it down.\n\n462\n00:23:06.473 --> 00:23:09.148\nAnd so Sheldon, or rather,\n\n463\n00:23:09.148 --> 00:23:14.915\nLeonard gives Penny Sheldon's\nmother's phone number.\n\n464\n00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:19.295\nAnd she calls his mother and he puts\nher on the phone with his mother and\n\n465\n00:23:19.295 --> 00:23:20.775\nshe makes him apologize.\n\n466\n00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:25.235\nAnd then at the end of that whole episode\nshe knocks on the door, says okay,\n\n467\n00:23:25.235 --> 00:23:26.995\nyou wanted to tell me something?\n\n468\n00:23:26.995 --> 00:23:30.195\nHe apologizes, they both apologize,\nthey kinda square off.\n\n469\n00:23:30.195 --> 00:23:32.960\nBut then he looks at her and\nsays well played.\n\n470\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.580\nAnd he says, okay, you got me but\n\n471\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.669\nwith great power comes great\nresponsibility, right?\n\n472\n00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:37.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n473\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.930\nso it's like a great\nexchange between the two.\n\n474\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.440\nSo you just have to understand, right?\n\n475\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.140\nYou just have to think about the fact\nthat when you're doing this,\n\n476\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.260\nyou gotta be in the mindset, right?\n\n477\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.850\nOf the hacker.\n\n478\n00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.190\nYou gotta be thinking about the fact that,\n\n479\n00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.920\nhey, if I go to that site,\nam I gonna wind up getting infected?\n\n480\n00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.480\nSo use what we would\ncall a throwaway machine.\n\n481\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.510\nYou don't use the machine where you're\ngonna do the main investigation.\n\n482\n00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.152\nUse what we actually have a term for\nit in the trade,\n\n483\n00:24:00.152 --> 00:24:02.622\nwe call it a sheep dip\nmachine believe it or not.\n\n484\n00:24:02.622 --> 00:24:04.202\nAs opposed to crab dip or fish dip.\n\n485\n00:24:04.202 --> 00:24:05.480\nWe call it sheep dip.\n\n486\n00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.822\nNot because sheep is good and you want\nto use it to make dip or dragon dip or\n\n487\n00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:10.856\nwe were talking about that or unicorn dip.\n\n488\n00:24:10.856 --> 00:24:11.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yup, that's fine.\n\n489\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.910\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to do that, but just\nbecause that's the name of the machine.\n\n490\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.960\nWe essentially call it\na throw away machine.\n\n491\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.880\nA machine that you would use.\n\n492\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.760\nWhere you would go out and\ntroll these sites.\n\n493\n00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760\nGet all this stuff together.\n\n494\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.150\nIf it gets damaged,\nyou're not going to worry about it.\n\n495\n00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.740\nEssentially, you can throw it away.\n\n496\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.320\nThese days, more often than not,\nthis is done with virtual environments.\n\n497\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.510\nSo, you create VM.\n\n498\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.940\nYou run the VM isolated\nin the memory space.\n\n499\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.580\nIf anything happens, you could essentially\nkill it and isolate it from the host and\n\n500\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.490\nprevent it from infecting the system.\n\n501\n00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.440\nSo, just keep that in mind and\nthink about that.\n\n502\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.615\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's go out and let's do the following.\n\n503\n00:24:41.615 --> 00:24:45.145\nLet us take a look,\njust minimize this real quick.\n\n504\n00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:47.105\nLet's take a look at loft crack.\n\n505\n00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:51.445\nJust open this up and let's take a look\nat how we actually crack some passwords.\n\n506\n00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:54.870\nI'll just run this thing here and\nso, what we're going to do.\n\n507\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.570\nAnd this is just a demo version of\nLoftCrack, so it says hey, buy this and\n\n508\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.870\nsay okay, no problem.\n\n509\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.570\nWe'll do that, we'll get around to that.\n\n510\n00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.150\nBut here,\nwhat we're going to be able to see is,\n\n511\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.605\nthe wizard that starts out with LoftCrack,\nright?\n\n512\n00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:08.460\nAnd so, it's LoftCrack six.\n\n513\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.400\nAgain, you can hunt around and\nfind versions of this sitting out there\n\n514\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.770\non the web and certainly,\nit's a very powerful tool.\n\n515\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.120\nOne that I would encourage\nyou to take a look at and\n\n516\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.200\nbecome familiar with,\nif you do this kind of work.\n\n517\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.100\nSo, we have the wizard.\n\n518\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.120\nWe don't have to use the wizard.\n\n519\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.880\nWe just launch Tool directly and\ndo this on our own.\n\n520\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.830\nBut just wanted you,\nif you haven't seen the tool before,\n\n521\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.770\nto have a sense of what the tool does.\n\n522\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.340\nSo we have the little hey,\nwelcome, let's get started screen.\n\n523\n00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.600\nNo problem, let's go ahead and\njust bypass that.\n\n524\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.775\nLet's get into screen number two,\nwhich says, hey,\n\n525\n00:25:36.775 --> 00:25:40.575\nchoose the following methods to\nretrieve your encrypted passwords.\n\n526\n00:25:40.575 --> 00:25:42.165\nRetrieve it from the local machine.\n\n527\n00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:45.155\nWe're going to do a hack on the local\nmachine just to show you how it works.\n\n528\n00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:47.415\nBut, notice we have a remote\nmachine capability.\n\n529\n00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:49.455\nYou connect out over the web.\n\n530\n00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:51.185\nRetrieve from NT 4 emergency repair disk.\n\n531\n00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:53.265\nThat's obviously not really\nan option these days.\n\n532\n00:25:53.265 --> 00:25:55.780\nBut if you remember,\nyou remember emergency?\n\n533\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.250\nThe emergency recovery disk, the ERD tool?\n\n534\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.420\nThe Windows tool for ERD?\n\n535\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.871\nDisk commander,\nI think it was called, right?\n\n536\n00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:10.070\nThat was Sysinternals, but before it was\nSysinternals, that was their product.\n\n537\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.690\nWhich Microsoft wound up buying and\nbecame Wininternals, right?\n\n538\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.520\nSo, you can do that with\nthe emergency repair disk.\n\n539\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.420\nNow that used to be a big issue,\nbecause you would do that and\n\n540\n00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.990\nafter NT4,\nwhen you started doing that Windows 2000.\n\n541\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.610\nAnd you broke the password and\ncracked it that way.\n\n542\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.720\nYou actually broke Active Directory and\n\n543\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.760\nyou couldn't restart the machine and\nget in.\n\n544\n00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.620\nIt essentially crashed\nthe machine when you did that,\n\n545\n00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.235\nso you got to be really careful\nin the newer versions of Windows.\n\n546\n00:26:33.235 --> 00:26:36.245\nAfter NT4,\nusing this kind of a recovery method,\n\n547\n00:26:36.245 --> 00:26:38.565\nbecause you would essentially\nhose the machine if you did it.\n\n548\n00:26:38.565 --> 00:26:41.705\nSo, you got to be careful with that and\nthen retrieve,\n\n549\n00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:42.835\nby sniffing the local network.\n\n550\n00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:45.175\nWe can actually pull those\nhashes in off the wire.\n\n551\n00:26:45.175 --> 00:26:46.565\nDo a little network sniffing.\n\n552\n00:26:46.565 --> 00:26:48.670\nGet the hashes and then, crack the hashes.\n\n553\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.840\nSo, it's a very powerful tool,\nwe can do all that.\n\n554\n00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.450\nSo, we're going to do local\nmachine recovery here.\n\n555\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.710\nAnd then what we have is,\n\n556\n00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.650\nwe have the ability to zoom in there for\nyou to do a quick password audit, right.\n\n557\n00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.160\nThis will find simple passwords that\nessentially are in the dictionary.\n\n558\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.170\nWe can do common password audit.\n\n559\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.940\nDoes the simple passwords as\nwell as some modifications,\n\n560\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.210\nso it transforms things like that.\n\n561\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.570\nStrong Password Audit.\n\n562\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.560\nThis allows you to do the dictionary,\nmodifications and the brute force attacks.\n\n563\n00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.660\nWhere we just hack away at\nevery option we have and\n\n564\n00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.610\nevery combination until we get in.\n\n565\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:26.670\nWith the demo version of the product,\nyou can only do quick or common Audits.\n\n566\n00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.090\nYou cannot do the Brute Forcing.\n\n567\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.970\nYou've got to actually pay for\nand license the product.\n\n568\n00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.260\nBut if you do that, you get full rights.\n\n569\n00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.940\nYou could do everything.\n\n570\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.410\nIncluding custom, where you can set,\nspecify certain options,\n\n571\n00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.620\ncomplex character sets,\nmultiple languages.\n\n572\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.450\nThere's a lot of options in this tool.\n\n573\n00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.400\nThis is a very strong and powerful tool.\n\n574\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.527\nSo, we just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n575\n00:27:46.527 --> 00:27:48.307\nWe then have to specify, hey,\n\n576\n00:27:48.307 --> 00:27:51.530\nhow are we going to do this\nwhen the passwords are found.\n\n577\n00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.910\nDo you want to display them or audit them?\n\n578\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.010\nDo you want to see the encryptive hashes?\n\n579\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.552\nWhat do we want?\n\n580\n00:27:56.552 --> 00:27:58.040\nWhat are the options, right?\n\n581\n00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.220\nAnd so, we'll set all that up and then,\nwould just go ahead and we'll get started.\n\n582\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.260\nHit finish.\n\n583\n00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:04.920\nBring those in.\n\n584\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.840\nWe're grabbing the password.\n\n585\n00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.060\nDump here and does a quick audit.\n\n586\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.680\nLet's just see what we get there.\n\n587\n00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.890\nNow, I've gone ahead and\nI've created a side from the default user,\n\n588\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.270\nwhich is the guest and\nthe admin users, right.\n\n589\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.390\nSo, you see those there.\n\n590\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.390\nI've created another user.\n\n591\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.860\nTop one, called Adam1.\n\n592\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.440\nJust for purposes of demonstration,\nso I've done that.\n\n593\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.760\nWe've done a quick audit.\n\n594\n00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.260\nBy the way, LM password, LAM M password,\n\n595\n00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.490\nis always going to be empty on newer\nversions of the Windows operating system.\n\n596\n00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.160\nWe don't see that anymore,\nbut you'll notice that\n\n597\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.930\nwe do have a hash of the LM password\nsnd so, we could see that there.\n\n598\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.940\nAnd we could also,\nI'm just going to scroll over.\n\n599\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.655\nThe LM hash, by the way, you'll notice,\nis going to be the same for every one.\n\n600\n00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:49.560\nBecause we don't really store a value and\nuse that.\n\n601\n00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.220\nIt's just a generic place holder.\n\n602\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.420\nWhat we're interested in is,\n\n603\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.840\nthe NTLM hash and you'll notice that\nthose are different for every user.\n\n604\n00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.100\nAdd one on top.\n\n605\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.350\nAdministrator in the middle.\n\n606\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.440\nGuest on the bottom.\n\n607\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.160\nThat's the one we're going to go after and\ncrack.\n\n608\n00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.310\nThat's essentially the cryptographic\nrepresentation of our password, right.\n\n609\n00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.950\nSo that is our password, but\n\n610\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.975\nas Daniel was suggesting,\nit's our password in a hashed form.\n\n611\n00:29:09.975 --> 00:29:14.065\nNow we could right,\nuse our powers of persuasion so\n\n612\n00:29:14.065 --> 00:29:16.445\nwe could put our power out there, right?\n\n613\n00:29:16.445 --> 00:29:18.845\nAnd if we're smart and\nwe're comfortable and\n\n614\n00:29:18.845 --> 00:29:22.522\nwe're true of heart and\nclean of mind, spirit and body.\n\n615\n00:29:22.522 --> 00:29:25.142\nWe may be able to understand\nwhat the endfield and hash is.\n\n616\n00:29:25.142 --> 00:29:28.282\nNow, we can and we will in a minute\nin the tool figure this out.\n\n617\n00:29:28.282 --> 00:29:31.112\nThe password I created for\nthe sample user is very small.\n\n618\n00:29:31.112 --> 00:29:32.492\nIt's going to be very easy to crack.\n\n619\n00:29:32.492 --> 00:29:33.940\nJust for purposes of demonstration.\n\n620\n00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.922\nIt's going to be quick, but if it's\na complex password, it may take a while.\n\n621\n00:29:37.922 --> 00:29:39.267\nSo, you got to get comfortable.\n\n622\n00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:40.222\nHave something to eat.\n\n623\n00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:44.368\nMaybe get a little peanut butter and\nwere gonna go ahead and\n\n624\n00:29:44.368 --> 00:29:46.490\ntake a look at how this works.\n\n625\n00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:51.233\nSo, what we're going to do here,\nscroll back over is, the following.\n\n626\n00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:54.920\nWere going to go back here and\nclick and do that.\n\n627\n00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.175\nI just want to show you session\noptions really quickly,\n\n628\n00:29:58.175 --> 00:30:01.230\nso we're just going to\nshow you where that is.\n\n629\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.690\nAnd you'll notice that for\n\n630\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.250\ndictionary crack we have our\ndictionary crack enabled.\n\n631\n00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.880\nThere's a dictionary list option.\n\n632\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.880\nThat's where we can pull in those\ndictionary lists that we downloaded or\n\n633\n00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.000\npotentially downloaded, right?\n\n634\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.010\nSo, we can pull them in.\n\n635\n00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.660\nWe can crack passwords.\n\n636\n00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.900\nWe can check that off.\n\n637\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.100\nIf we're doing a dictionary brute hybrid,\nwe would enable that.\n\n638\n00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.950\nNotice, we could specify the number\nof characters that we want to use.\n\n639\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.265\nAnd if we have a pre-computed hash list,\na rainbow table.\n\n640\n00:30:27.265 --> 00:30:28.605\nWe could bring in the hash file list.\n\n641\n00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:30.605\nWe would be able to enable that there and\n\n642\n00:30:30.605 --> 00:30:33.835\nat the bottom,\nthe brute force cracking can be enabled.\n\n643\n00:30:33.835 --> 00:30:35.805\nAnd we can specify alpha and numeric,\n\n644\n00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:38.615\nalphanumeric special characters,\nmultiple language sets.\n\n645\n00:30:38.615 --> 00:30:40.085\nYou'll see English is there.\n\n646\n00:30:40.085 --> 00:30:41.335\nWe have different options.\n\n647\n00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:44.895\nSo we can set up and\nenable these options in the toll and\n\n648\n00:30:44.895 --> 00:30:47.870\nthen, create more complex scenarios for\ncracking.\n\n649\n00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.622\nSo, we just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n650\n00:30:49.622 --> 00:30:53.650\nWe're going to go ahead, I'm just\ngoing to bring up the dictionary list.\n\n651\n00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.690\nI'm going to show you what it looks like.\n\n652\n00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.500\nSo, all I've done is select\nthe dictionary list.\n\n653\n00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.240\nI've brought it up.\n\n654\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.310\nThat's the default one built-in\nwith the tool, and I can edit it.\n\n655\n00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.540\nOr add additional lists in or\ncreate a new one.\n\n656\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.030\nSo, I just want to show you what\na typical default password list,\n\n657\n00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.070\ndictionary list may look like here.\n\n658\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:14.810\nYou'll see that it has a whole bunch of\nletters and numbers and various things and\n\n659\n00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:15.840\nlet's just scroll down.\n\n660\n00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.320\nAnd you'll see literally\nit's just a list of words.\n\n661\n00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.860\nIndividual, uppercase, lowercase,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n662\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.250\nAs if there is any case\nother than upper or lower.\n\n663\n00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.380\nBut you could see as we go through,\nit's just got iterations and\n\n664\n00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.060\nvariations of a variety of things, right.\n\n665\n00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.330\nAnd it's kind of all there.\n\n666\n00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.270\nThis is the default list, built in.\n\n667\n00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.465\nAnd if our password is\nsomething like zucchini,\n\n668\n00:31:38.465 --> 00:31:39.690\nbecuase that's a common password.\n\n669\n00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:40.830\nPeople do use that.\n\n670\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.600\nIf we do use zucchini as our password for\ninstance, it's in the list and\n\n671\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.840\nwe would in theory, find it.\n\n672\n00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.591\nSo, this is what the value of\na password list [LAUGH] is.\n\n673\n00:31:48.591 --> 00:31:50.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Going to start using zucchini as my\n\n674\n00:31:50.556 --> 00:31:52.195\ndefault password going forward, right.\n\n675\n00:31:52.195 --> 00:31:54.035\nAll right, so\nwe're going to specify, right.\n\n676\n00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:54.909\nHow did you know, right?\n\n677\n00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:56.394\nWe're going to specify that.\n\n678\n00:31:56.394 --> 00:31:59.820\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nnotice, just before I do this, right.\n\n679\n00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.558\nThat the password currently is blank,\nright?\n\n680\n00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:04.360\nIn other words,\nthere's no password in the password field.\n\n681\n00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.802\nWe don't know what it is yet, right?\n\n682\n00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:06.827\nWe're gonna obviously figure that out.\n\n683\n00:32:06.827 --> 00:32:10.070\nBut we have no password listed there for\nnow.\n\n684\n00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.490\nAll right, so now, right?\n\n685\n00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.280\nLet's do this and let's do the following.\n\n686\n00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.110\nSo if we wanna find that password, right?\n\n687\n00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:25.070\nLet me just set this up, make sure that\nwas, okay, yeah, make sure that was there.\n\n688\n00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:30.998\nAnd let's go ahead,\nlet's do this one more time.\n\n689\n00:32:30.998 --> 00:32:34.195\nOkay, and I just had to specify\nthe option to use the NTLM crack and\n\n690\n00:32:34.195 --> 00:32:37.410\nmake sure we brought the dictionary\nlist in to find the password.\n\n691\n00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.552\nBecause the import initially doesn't let\nyou do that or doesn't have it specified,\n\n692\n00:32:41.552 --> 00:32:42.944\nso we don't see a password.\n\n693\n00:32:42.944 --> 00:32:45.971\nBut now that I've done that and\nI've run it quickly, and\n\n694\n00:32:45.971 --> 00:32:48.745\nyou saw it didn't take very\nlong at all for my image,\n\n695\n00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:52.614\njust bring that up in the screen so\nwe could see that, for my Adam1 user.\n\n696\n00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:56.717\nYou'll see that when I use the dictionary\nlist and I say, hey, crack and\n\n697\n00:32:56.717 --> 00:33:00.730\nNTLM passwords, you'll see that\nthe password for the user is there.\n\n698\n00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.930\nIt's a pretty simple password, right?\n\n699\n00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:06.590\nThe word password with just a 0 instead\nof an o and a capital P, right, and\n\n700\n00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.390\nthat's obviously in our dictionary list.\n\n701\n00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:14.900\nThat's how we found it, but\nthe NTLM hash right over there,\n\n702\n00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.160\nthat hash is actually representative\nof that word password.\n\n703\n00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.817\nAnd if I was to take that hash and\nrun it through a rainbow table\n\n704\n00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:27.719\nthat has that password precomputed with\nNTLM as the hashing mechanism, right?\n\n705\n00:33:27.719 --> 00:33:29.705\nThe algorithm used and the mechanism used,\n\n706\n00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:32.979\nI would actually get that same password\nMusical Rainbow table crack, or\n\n707\n00:33:32.979 --> 00:33:35.999\nhash file list crack, which this\ntool is capable of doing as well.\n\n708\n00:33:35.999 --> 00:33:39.859\nNow, some other things this tool can do,\nwe can see two account options or\n\n709\n00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:44.221\nremediation options right there, I could\ndisable accounts on the local machine,\n\n710\n00:33:44.221 --> 00:33:45.609\nforce password changes.\n\n711\n00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:48.519\nSo again, we're not getting into\nthe hacking aspects of this tool.\n\n712\n00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:52.745\nBut if I was using this remotely, if I\nhad already cracked the admin password,\n\n713\n00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:54.868\nimagine what I could do with this tool.\n\n714\n00:33:54.868 --> 00:33:57.224\nI could go in and lock out accounts and\n\n715\n00:33:57.224 --> 00:34:01.937\nreconfigure them on the fly remotely\nin a system using this kind of a tool.\n\n716\n00:34:01.937 --> 00:34:05.684\nAnd this is one of the kinda\nthe darker sides of the forensics tools\n\n717\n00:34:05.684 --> 00:34:10.690\nis that they're also hacking tools, but\ncracking passwords is no more difficult.\n\n718\n00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:11.472\nAnd I don't wanna make light of it.\n\n719\n00:34:11.472 --> 00:34:14.681\nIt's a very difficult process if\nthe password is complex, right?\n\n720\n00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:17.390\nAnd there are things we\ncould do to make it complex.\n\n721\n00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.390\nI could've added spaces.\n\n722\n00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.045\nI could've added special characters.\n\n723\n00:34:20.045 --> 00:34:25.487\nI could've made the password longer,\nright, than eight or nine characters.\n\n724\n00:34:25.487 --> 00:34:28.727\nForcing two blocks of data to\nbe used to store the password.\n\n725\n00:34:28.727 --> 00:34:31.180\nHaving to crack multiple\nblocks takes a lot longer,\n\n726\n00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.641\nit increases the complexity and\nthe time involved.\n\n727\n00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:36.961\nSo there's a lot of things I\ncould've done to this password.\n\n728\n00:34:36.961 --> 00:34:39.539\nWe made it overly simple so\nwe would actually be able to show it to\n\n729\n00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:42.557\nyou in a relatively quick amount of\nthe time for the demonstration without\n\n730\n00:34:42.557 --> 00:34:45.010\nmaking you sit around and\nwait for time lapse photography.\n\n731\n00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.938\nI'd grow a beard, well, wait,\nI already have one of those, but\n\n732\n00:34:47.938 --> 00:34:50.965\nI'd shave it off and grow it back\nagain and we'd still be waiting.\n\n733\n00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:54.180\nI've run this tool against passwords\nwhere it's taken days to able to crack\n\n734\n00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:54.833\nthe password,\n\n735\n00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:57.862\nbecause the password is complex and\nit takes a time to crank through it.\n\n736\n00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:01.817\nSo this is just a very simple\ndemonstration, but effective, hopefully,\n\n737\n00:35:01.817 --> 00:35:04.471\nto show you the concept of\nwhat we actually can do.\n\n738\n00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:08.629\nNow if i took that password and recovered\nthe information associated with it,\n\n739\n00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:10.710\nI would then be able to access the data.\n\n740\n00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.300\nIt wouldn't be very difficult\nto do at that point.\n\n741\n00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.160\nSo, we wanna know that a tool like\nthis allows us to be able to interact\n\n742\n00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.960\nand to do that.\n\n743\n00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.972\nNow, we mentioned rainbow tables.\n\n744\n00:35:17.972 --> 00:35:19.302\nLet's take a look at rainbow tables.\n\n745\n00:35:19.302 --> 00:35:21.971\nI know when I mention them,\nyou're always excited about the concept.\n\n746\n00:35:21.971 --> 00:35:22.562\n&gt;&gt; I love them.\n\n747\n00:35:22.562 --> 00:35:24.976\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at\nwhat a rainbow table is.\n\n748\n00:35:24.976 --> 00:35:27.489\nSo list of rainbow tables, right?\n\n749\n00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:29.881\nI usually go out to\nproject-rainbowcrack.com.\n\n750\n00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:31.872\nThere's a lot of different\nsites out there.\n\n751\n00:35:31.872 --> 00:35:33.665\nIt's just one that is usually good.\n\n752\n00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:35.230\nThey got a lot of rainbow tables.\n\n753\n00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:40.186\nYou could see here that the rainbow\ntables are generated for both LM, LanMan,\n\n754\n00:35:40.186 --> 00:35:41.399\nand NTLM hashing.\n\n755\n00:35:41.399 --> 00:35:47.165\nAnd so we can go in and we can go and\nwe can pull down Rainbow Tables.\n\n756\n00:35:47.165 --> 00:35:52.511\nNow they actually have some really cool\nYouTube video demonstrations on doing\n\n757\n00:35:52.511 --> 00:35:58.120\nsome hacking here with NTLM MD5,\ncan't say the word, the letter M today.\n\n758\n00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.568\nMD5 shy 1, I encourage you to take a look\nat some if you wanna see this in action.\n\n759\n00:36:02.568 --> 00:36:04.668\nWe're not gonna actually do\na rainbow table hack, but\n\n760\n00:36:04.668 --> 00:36:06.594\nwe are gonna just talk\nabout the concept with you.\n\n761\n00:36:06.594 --> 00:36:09.597\nBut the idea here, and you'll see\nwhy in just a minute, by the way,\n\n762\n00:36:09.597 --> 00:36:12.182\ncuz downloading some [LAUGH] of these is,\nas Daniel knows,\n\n763\n00:36:12.182 --> 00:36:14.223\ngonna take a little bit of patience and\ntime.\n\n764\n00:36:14.223 --> 00:36:15.925\n&gt;&gt; I hope you've got a lot of drive space.\n\n765\n00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:16.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n766\n00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:21.840\nlet's take a look potentially at\nsomething like an MD5 rainbow table.\n\n767\n00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.720\nLet's just bring this up here, and\ncould we go full-screen for a sec?\n\n768\n00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.420\nIt's gonna be a little bit easier for\nyou to see that.\n\n769\n00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.791\nSo when we go full-screen,\nwhat you can see, let me zoom in here, so\n\n770\n00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:31.201\nyou could see this, right?\n\n771\n00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:36.232\nSo, when we look at an MD5 hash for\nascii character set 32 with\n\n772\n00:36:36.232 --> 00:36:42.392\nplain text length for the password of\nlet's say 1 to 7 or 1 to 8 characters.\n\n773\n00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:46.694\nLook at the difference from\n1 to 7 to 1 to 8 in terms of\n\n774\n00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:50.821\nthe number of Key Space actual entries and\nthe size.\n\n775\n00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:56.039\n1 to 7 plaintext characters,\n\n776\n00:36:56.039 --> 00:37:04.362\nwe got 70,576,641,626,495.\n\n777\n00:37:04.362 --> 00:37:05.384\nSay that three times fast, right?\n\n778\n00:37:05.384 --> 00:37:09.421\nNow with that, if we download that,\nthat is 52 gigs in size.\n\n779\n00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:15.131\nWe get a 99.9% chance of success,\nmeaning, it is almost a 100% lock,\n\n780\n00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:19.478\nthat the password that has been generated,\nwhatever it is,\n\n781\n00:37:19.478 --> 00:37:24.872\nis gonna be somewhere in that 71,\napproximately, trillion Key Space.\n\n782\n00:37:24.872 --> 00:37:29.363\nIt's 52 Gigs worth of hashes, we're\ngonna download that file or that table,\n\n783\n00:37:29.363 --> 00:37:34.270\nwe're gonna load that up into L0phtCrack,\nwe're gonna run our password against it.\n\n784\n00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.000\nSo we're gonna sit back and wait.\n\n785\n00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.280\nBut eventually, if we wait long enough,\n\n786\n00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.090\nwe're gonna find the password cuz we're\ngonna be able to translate the hash.\n\n787\n00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.750\nNow if we add an extra character,\neight, look at what it goes up to.\n\n788\n00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.210\nWhat's after trillion?\n\n789\n00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.587\nA quadrillion-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Quadrillion, yeah.\n\n790\n00:37:49.587 --> 00:37:52.775\n&gt;&gt; We just say its a heaping large amount,\nright?\n\n791\n00:37:52.775 --> 00:37:53.517\n&gt;&gt; A big old number.\n\n792\n00:37:53.517 --> 00:37:54.160\n&gt;&gt; Big old number.\n\n793\n00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.593\nSo whatever that is, right?\n\n794\n00:37:55.593 --> 00:37:58.425\n&gt;&gt; 460 gigabytes in size of data,\nyeah, so it's-\n\n795\n00:37:58.425 --> 00:37:59.111\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, I mean,\n\n796\n00:37:59.111 --> 00:37:59.927\nit's almost half a terabyte.\n\n797\n00:37:59.927 --> 00:38:00.764\nIt quadruples in size.\n\n798\n00:38:00.764 --> 00:38:01.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n799\n00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:05.244\n&gt;&gt; Or no, eight times,\nit's eight times as big, not quadruples.\n\n800\n00:38:05.244 --> 00:38:06.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Quadruples twice, right?\n\n801\n00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:07.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n802\n00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.370\nit essentially is eight times the size\nin terms of the entries and the numbers.\n\n803\n00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.120\nAnd we go down a little bit\nin overall veracity and\n\n804\n00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.390\nessentially, we're saying it's about\n97% chance you're gonna get it.\n\n805\n00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.130\nSo there is a 3% chance\nafter we do all that\n\n806\n00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.530\nthat our password hash may not be\nin that set when we run this thing.\n\n807\n00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.037\n&gt;&gt; That would hurt.\n&gt;&gt; That would, yeah, see,\n\n808\n00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:30.494\nultimately this is why you need to have\nmore than one person doing this, right?\n\n809\n00:38:30.494 --> 00:38:33.809\nBecause you gotta have multiple people\nworking on this or multiple systems,\n\n810\n00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:36.371\nnot necessarily multiple people but\nmultiple computers.\n\n811\n00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.673\nHacking away at this thing,\nrunning and churning at the same time.\n\n812\n00:38:39.673 --> 00:38:42.598\nBecause you don't wanna wait for one\ncomputer to go all the way through that,\n\n813\n00:38:42.598 --> 00:38:44.970\nmaybe take a week,\nwho knows how long that would take.\n\n814\n00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.228\nAnd then, ultimately come up and\nsay, yeah, by the way, guess what?\n\n815\n00:38:48.228 --> 00:38:50.387\nLucky you, you're in that 3%, right?\n\n816\n00:38:50.387 --> 00:38:52.589\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Go buy a lottery ticket, yeah.\n\n817\n00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:53.236\n&gt;&gt; Come back and play another day.\n\n818\n00:38:53.236 --> 00:38:54.880\nAt that point,\nyou should buy a lottery ticket, right?\n\n819\n00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.640\nSo, rainbow tables are precomputed\nfiles with all of the hashes and\n\n820\n00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.100\nthe equivalent passwords laid out.\n\n821\n00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.934\nSo if you imagine what we just took a look\nat with the dictionary file, right?\n\n822\n00:39:04.934 --> 00:39:08.108\nLet's go back into L0phtCrack for\njust a second just to show you this.\n\n823\n00:39:08.108 --> 00:39:09.532\nLet's go back into here.\n\n824\n00:39:09.532 --> 00:39:10.992\nLet's bring back this dictionary list.\n\n825\n00:39:10.992 --> 00:39:15.584\nLet's edit this and\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n826\n00:39:15.584 --> 00:39:17.160\nThat would help if I did that,\nwouldn't it?\n\n827\n00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:23.330\nSo essentially what we are talking about\na rainbow table is something like this,\n\n828\n00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.320\nlet me pull down here.\n\n829\n00:39:25.535 --> 00:39:29.080\nLet's just say hypothetically\nthat abstention was our password,\n\n830\n00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.640\nwhat we would have in the table, think\nof this as essentially two column table.\n\n831\n00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.418\nWhat we would have is something like this,\nright?\n\n832\n00:39:40.497 --> 00:39:43.666\nLet's just say hypothetically that\nlet's make this full screen so\n\n833\n00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:44.672\nit's easier to see.\n\n834\n00:39:44.672 --> 00:39:48.758\nLet's just say hypothetically\nthat that was our MD5 hash.\n\n835\n00:39:48.758 --> 00:39:52.715\nI know it's not 128 bits but assume\nthat it's almost representative of that.\n\n836\n00:39:52.715 --> 00:39:56.896\nWe would see a listing in a table form\ngoing down for every password We figured\n\n837\n00:39:56.896 --> 00:40:00.359\nout or wanna understand and\nthe computed equivalent hash, and\n\n838\n00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:03.680\nthis is what the hash table or\nrainbow table looks like.\n\n839\n00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.589\nIt's just literally mile after mile\nof this stuff sitting in a file, but\n\n840\n00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:12.011\nit's maybe half a terabyte of this, right,\nif it's the one we just looked at, or\n\n841\n00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:13.730\n50 gigs or whatever it is.\n\n842\n00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.800\nWe would load this up and\nthen we would be doing the comparison.\n\n843\n00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.220\nWhen we run the crack, what we're doing is\nwe have the computed hash value, right?\n\n844\n00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.770\nSo we have that, and\nwhat we're doing is we're looking for\n\n845\n00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.780\nthat match in the table and looking for\nthe password it's equivalent to.\n\n846\n00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.859\nWe pull that password out and say ding,\nding, ding, right, you're a winner.\n\n847\n00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:33.900\nAnd that's what we show on the screen\nif we have the equivalent.\n\n848\n00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.140\n&gt;&gt; And that's because when it comes to\nhashing, hashing is a one way algorithm.\n\n849\n00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.555\nYou don't decode a hashed string,\nyou can only encode it so\n\n850\n00:40:41.555 --> 00:40:45.505\nthey're basically saying I'm going to take\na string, hash it, see what that value is,\n\n851\n00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:49.465\nand then compare the two values that\nI'm seeing and see if they match up.\n\n852\n00:40:49.465 --> 00:40:52.897\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it is, so\nit's interesting, right?\n\n853\n00:40:52.897 --> 00:40:56.327\nLet me comment on what your comment\nwas cuz you're absolutely right.\n\n854\n00:40:56.327 --> 00:40:59.957\nBut essentially even though you're right,\nit actually is\n\n855\n00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.967\nthe exact thing we're doing, even though\nyou're not supposed to be able to do it.\n\n856\n00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:04.458\nAnd what I mean is the following.\n\n857\n00:41:04.458 --> 00:41:08.470\nWhat Daniel described is absolutely\n100% accurate and correct,\n\n858\n00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:12.959\nthat a hash is a one way function that\nrepresents the data cryptographically in\n\n859\n00:41:12.959 --> 00:41:14.944\nan alphanumeric string, right?\n\n860\n00:41:14.944 --> 00:41:17.768\nThat's what the hash does,\nit represents the data.\n\n861\n00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:21.758\nWe're not encrypting the data trying\nto hide it, we're cryptographically\n\n862\n00:41:21.758 --> 00:41:25.818\nrepresenting the data in the output of\nthe algorithm, the hashing algorithm.\n\n863\n00:41:25.818 --> 00:41:31.470\nWe call the hash string or the output or\nthe digital signature, message digest.\n\n864\n00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:32.700\nThere's all these terms we use for\n\n865\n00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.990\nit depending on what we're\nusing hashing to represent.\n\n866\n00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.500\nBut generically it's the hash output,\nright, it's the value.\n\n867\n00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.550\nThat string represents the data.\n\n868\n00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.860\nIt is not hiding the data, right?\n\n869\n00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.280\nWe're not encrypting the data.\n\n870\n00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.730\nWe are representing\nthe data cryptographically.\n\n871\n00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.700\nNow as a result of that,\n\n872\n00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.630\nDaniel is absolutely right,\nit is a one way function.\n\n873\n00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:56.450\nWe don't decrypt or run backwards the hash\nin order to understand essentially and\n\n874\n00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.620\nderive the data that was\nused to generate it.\n\n875\n00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.785\nBut what we do, essentially figure out\na way to get around that prohibition, but\n\n876\n00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:06.062\nstill doing it, is what Daniel described.\n\n877\n00:42:06.062 --> 00:42:10.905\nWhich is, hey, let's compute values,\nsee what the hashes are,\n\n878\n00:42:10.905 --> 00:42:15.030\ntake those hashes and\ncompare them to what we know.\n\n879\n00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.520\nAnd, if we get a winner,\nessentially if we get a match,\n\n880\n00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.700\neven though we didn't reverse engineer it,\nwe essentially did, right?\n\n881\n00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.410\nBecause we figured it out by deducing it,\neven though we didn't necessarily\n\n882\n00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.850\nunderstand what that was by breaking it,\nby essentially decoding it.\n\n883\n00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:33.210\nWe did it by matching it without\nthe knowing the value ahead of time,\n\n884\n00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.806\nby simply coming up of the list\nof all possible values and\n\n885\n00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:38.400\nseeing if our string is in that list.\n\n886\n00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.818\nAnd so while we're not\ntraditionally reverse engineering,\n\n887\n00:42:40.818 --> 00:42:43.384\nwe actually are coming up with\na way to figure it out nonetheless.\n\n888\n00:42:43.384 --> 00:42:48.700\nSo it's an interesting observation because\nit is technically violating the concept\n\n889\n00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:54.102\nand the law that we've put down about not\nreverse engineering, by working around it.\n\n890\n00:42:54.102 --> 00:42:57.744\nBut essentially, without doing it we\nactually wind up in the same place.\n\n891\n00:42:57.744 --> 00:42:58.259\n&gt;&gt; It's so funny.\n\n892\n00:42:58.259 --> 00:42:59.903\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda cool.\nIt's just kind of a little quirk but\n\n893\n00:42:59.903 --> 00:43:02.380\nit's kind of interesting to look at and\nto explain.\n\n894\n00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.580\nSo what we've done essentially, right,\ncuz we've gone in and we figured out, or\n\n895\n00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:12.290\nat least talked about and showed you how\nto figure out what we could get if we do,\n\n896\n00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.920\nlet's say, network sniffing,\nhypothetically.\n\n897\n00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.550\nAssume for a minute we've done some\nmonitoring, come up with all these hashes\n\n898\n00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.460\nin network traffic and\nnow we've run them through a program and\n\n899\n00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.850\nwe've decoded those passwords by\nunderstanding the equivalent clear text,\n\n900\n00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.760\nor whatever the password string\nwas that generated the hash.\n\n901\n00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.750\nWithout necessarily knowing it,\nwe've actually figured out and\n\n902\n00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.280\ncome up with a way to\nguess the hashed password.\n\n903\n00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.160\nAnd we can now use the password to\nget in and see the information.\n\n904\n00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.390\nWe're gonna take a look in part two,\ncuz we're gonna have a part two.\n\n905\n00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:46.390\nWe're gonna take a look in part two, saved\nanother demo for you, a really cool one.\n\n906\n00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.640\nWe're gonna go in, we're gonna take\na look at how to hack a PDF and\n\n907\n00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.900\nactually essentially open it up, right?\n\n908\n00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.455\nTake the password and\nfigure out what it is using the tool,\n\n909\n00:43:54.455 --> 00:43:56.749\nsame kinda similar concept but\nwe're gonna go in and\n\n910\n00:43:56.749 --> 00:43:59.427\nuse that password to then open\nup a password encrypted file.\n\n911\n00:43:59.427 --> 00:44:03.069\nAnd we're just gonna talk a little bit\nmore about some of the attacks and\n\n912\n00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:04.560\nmechanisms that we can use.\n\n913\n00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.990\nWe talked about things like dictionary\nattacks and brute force attacks already.\n\n914\n00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.003\nBut we're just gonna have a little bit\nmore to say about that as we get going.\n\n915\n00:44:10.003 --> 00:44:13.940\nSo come back to a little,\na little part due as they say.\n\n916\n00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.000\n&gt;&gt; That's always fun, right.\n\n917\n00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.267\nWe got more for you, because not only\ncan systems need to be gotten into but,\n\n918\n00:44:19.267 --> 00:44:23.669\nlike Adam alluded to at the beginning of\nthis episode, maybe a bad actor has put\n\n919\n00:44:23.669 --> 00:44:28.433\nsome information on the system that could\nbe evidence and locked it with a password.\n\n920\n00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:29.927\nNow how do we get to that PDF file?\n\n921\n00:44:29.927 --> 00:44:31.367\n&gt;&gt; Shame on that bad actor.\n\n922\n00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:32.850\n&gt;&gt; Dirty, dirty people there.\n\n923\n00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:36.960\nWe're gonna get around that in part two so\ndefinitely show back up for that.\n\n924\n00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.920\nAdam, thanks for joining us today.\n\n925\n00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.259\nWe do thank you good people for\njoining us as well.\n\n926\n00:44:40.259 --> 00:44:43.532\nBut it looks like it's that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n927\n00:44:43.532 --> 00:44:46.340\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n928\n00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.260\n&gt;&gt; I am a NTLM hash.\n\n929\n00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.002\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n930\n00:44:49.002 --> 00:44:56.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n931\n00:44:56.780 -->

[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; Wow,\nI didn't get to sit down during the break.\n\n53\n00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we could pause.\n\n54\n00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:00.688\nWe can come back, take a break,\n\n55\n00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.350\npick up part two after I've\ntaken a break and sat down.\n\n56\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.290\nCuz I'm tired.\n\n57\n00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.240\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n58\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.315\nI didn't realize we did all\nthat just in that one episode.\n\n59\n00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:07.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n60\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.120\nwhat we're gonna pick up and do from\nthere then is just talk about some of\n\n61\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.930\nthe password attack categories, right we\ntalked about different kinds of passwords.\n\n62\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.110\nI showed you one specific tool\nthat could be used to achieve\n\n63\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530\na lot of these kinds of attacks,\nso we hinted at some others.\n\n64\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.960\nWe talked about sniffing network traffic,\nand being able to go online and\n\n65\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.800\npassively capture those passwords, and\nuse a tool to be able to do that, not so\n\n66\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.005\nmuch the password, although in theory\nwe may find them a fairly transmitted\n\n67\n00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.995\nin the clear, but normally passwords\nare going to be obfuscated in some way.\n\n68\n00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:40.965\nWe may be getting encrypted\ncopies of the passwords,\n\n69\n00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.525\nlittle bit more difficult to deal with and\naddress and attack.\n\n70\n00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:45.395\nWe may be able to get hashes.\n\n71\n00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.035\nWe've talked about how to work with those.\n\n72\n00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:51.015\nSo we have wire sniffing, we have\nreplay attacks and middlemen attacks,\n\n73\n00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.710\nwe talked about these kinds of things.\n\n74\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.940\nWe could guess passwords,\nwe've talked about that and\n\n75\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.320\nspoken about how that may work.\n\n76\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.980\nWe could take those hashes and\n\n77\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.910\ninject them,\nto then be able to take over a session.\n\n78\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.660\nWe've talked about getting the hashes,\nshown you how to essentially reverse them,\n\n79\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.290\neven though we don't really technically,\nand we'll do air quotes,\n\n80\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.700\ntechnically reverse them.\n\n81\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.400\nBut we did talk about the idea\nbehind using a precomputed\n\n82\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.340\nset of hashes to represent what\nthe passwords are, we went through that.\n\n83\n00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.120\nSo we looked at rainbow table,\nshowed you where those could be.\n\n84\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.540\nThe idea of being able to distribute that\npassword cracking capability across a grid\n\n85\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.960\nof multiple computers\nwas discussed as well.\n\n86\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.000\nTo do offline, work to speed up the\nbreaking or guessing of those passwords.\n\n87\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.240\nBut we didn't really speak\nabout the last category,\n\n88\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.120\nwhat we will call non-electronic.\n\n89\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.740\nOr essentially social\nengineering based attacks and\n\n90\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.170\nmechanisms that can be\nused to derive passwords.\n\n91\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.970\nWe may be able to trick somebody\ninto telling us what a password is\n\n92\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.140\nas an investigator.\n\n93\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.680\nMaybe we sit down and\ninterview them and along the way,\n\n94\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.180\nwe're talking about different things,\nand we get information from them,\n\n95\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.290\nwithout them realizing it, that may\nhave been used to create the passwords.\n\n96\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.880\nHey, what's your birthday,\nwhat's your social security number?\n\n97\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.480\nWhat's your drivers license number,\n\n98\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.110\nwhat's your favorite food,\nwhat's your favorite color, right?\n\n99\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.815\nWhat astrological sign are you?\n\n100\n00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:05.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm a Pisces,\n\n101\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.940\nI like black, I prefer flowers\nas opposed to other things.\n\n102\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.280\nAnd so when you go through that,\n\n103\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550\nget the dating profile as we\noften refer to it [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you get all that information,\n\n105\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.750\nyou'd be surprised how often that kind\nof stuff can help us to understand and\n\n106\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.980\nessentially lead to the answers\nabout what a password may be.\n\n107\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.090\nWe can do what's called,\naggregation, or inference, and\n\n108\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.680\nas an investigator we can take\nsmall little bits of information\n\n109\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.820\nfrom different places that seemingly\nare random, and indeed often are.\n\n110\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.240\nBut we can build them up to be than able\nto create value, or guess a password.\n\n111\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.530\nAnd we can either build it\nup through aggregation or\n\n112\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.410\ninfer what that password may be.\n\n113\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.040\nA lot of times those security questions\nthat you often have to answer right?\n\n114\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.840\nYou know, what's your mothers maiden name,\nwhat is the first school you went to,\n\n115\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.370\nwhat's your first pet's name, all that\nkind of crazy stuff that they ask you.\n\n116\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.646\nIf we get those questions and those\nanswers from you during an investigation,\n\n117\n00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:02.160\nyou'd be surprised how much information\nwe can derive and actually understand.\n\n118\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.040\nI purposely make up random\nstuff because I never want to\n\n119\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.390\nbe tricked into giving that stuff out.\n\n120\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.525\nSo my first pet's name\nis always Troubadour.\n\n121\n00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:11.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Troubadour.\n\n122\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.935\n&gt;&gt; Troubadour or zucchini,\nthat's [CROSSTALK]\n\n123\n00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:15.263\n&gt;&gt; You saw the first episode,\n\n124\n00:05:15.263 --> 00:05:18.400\nyou would know if you saw part one,\nexactly why I said zucchini.\n\n125\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.788\nYou would know that, but\nif you have not seen that, it is random.\n\n126\n00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:22.510\n&gt;&gt; Right over the head.\n\n127\n00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.190\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole point right there,\nbut that's the whole point, it is random.\n\n128\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.780\nAnd see I will often\nmake up random stuff and\n\n129\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.780\nI will purposely give out misinformation\njust because I like to watch people screw\n\n130\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.450\nthings up, it's just how I am,\nI'm one of those people.\n\n131\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.790\n&gt;&gt; You're a devious man.\n\n132\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.220\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Your a devious man.\n\n133\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.747\n&gt;&gt; I am, it's all the espresso.\n\n134\n00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:42.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes you devious,\n\n135\n00:05:42.277 --> 00:05:43.660\nit's what it does.\n\n136\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.790\nIt's, they should just relabel it, instead\nof double espresso, devious coffee.\n\n137\n00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would be, see,\n\n138\n00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:48.222\nwe just came up with another one.\n\n139\n00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWe just got another one.\n\n140\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.410\n&gt;&gt; We gotta write this down.\n\n141\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.010\nWe gotta keep track of this stuff.\n\n142\n00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.660\nThis is awesome.\n\n143\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.930\n&gt;&gt; We should work for a marketing company.\n\n144\n00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.080\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nWe should do that.\n\n145\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.800\nThat, or Hallmark.\n\n146\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.280\nSo total business are random aside,\nby the way, continuing from last episode.\n\n147\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.410\nHere's the side for this one.\n\n148\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.310\nSo a Simpsons random aside for you.\n\n149\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.470\nSo, number one,\nrule of fact about the Simpsons.\n\n150\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.300\nThey just got renewed.\n\n151\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.370\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I think you wanted me to talk about\n\n152\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.890\nthis, right?\n\n153\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.410\nSo ultimately,\nthey're going to be on a 30 year run.\n\n154\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.880\nLongest TV show in history.\n\n155\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.490\nThey're going to have.\n\n156\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.860\nWhen they ultimately finish this contract\nthey just got renewed for, 30 years.\n\n157\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.450\n&gt;&gt; That's amazing.\n\n158\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.650\n&gt;&gt; It's something ridiculous.\n\n159\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.690\nI think 10,000 episodes, or\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n160\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.620\n30 years.\n\n161\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.720\nAnyway, that's not the random aside.\n\n162\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.890\nRandom aside is,\nI don't know if you ever saw this episode,\n\n163\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.650\nif you're a Simpsonophile.\n\n164\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.205\nThat is a word, I just made it up.\n\n165\n00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:30.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Coined a phrase.\n\n166\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.430\n&gt;&gt; Coined a phrase.\nBut at one point, in one of the episodes,\n\n167\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.980\nI don't remember which one, but\n\n168\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.046\nI know it existed because I\ndid see it at least once.\n\n169\n00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:41.210\n[LAUGH] So Homer as he always had,\ndoes something stupid.\n\n170\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.820\nBart winds up essentially having to write\ngreeting cards, he's just like chained\n\n171\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.150\nunderneath this building like the bowels\nof a building to a desk working for\n\n172\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.730\nlike the evil equivalent of Hallmark\nwriting greeting cards, right?\n\n173\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.890\nAnd he and\na whole bunch of other children.\n\n174\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.810\nIt's almost like a pied\npiper kind of episode.\n\n175\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.930\nAnd so Homer has to go and\nessentially rescue right him.\n\n176\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.070\nSo we goes through all these different\nsecurity checks to get in, right?\n\n177\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.700\nAnd your fingerprints.\n\n178\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.010\nAnd we need your blood sample.\n\n179\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.290\nAll the crazy stuff.\n\n180\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.670\nBut the last security check on\nthe vault until I get in, right?\n\n181\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.050\nTo ultimately get in to\nwhere they're working.\n\n182\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.096\nIs the Buttscan 3000.\n\n183\n00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:17.965\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The ultimate biometric device.\n\n184\n00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's just it's really hilarious,\n\n185\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.080\nright, cuz you hear it's like, okay,\nthey're gonna do a butt scan, so\n\n186\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.130\nyou hear the zipper.\n\n187\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.120\nBut they don't actually\nshow you the butt scan, but\n\n188\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.210\nyou hear they're getting ready for it.\n\n189\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.240\nSo it's It's really funny,\na little take on biometric security.\n\n190\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.700\nSo, randomness is\nimportant as a hacker and\n\n191\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.000\na security professional, but when we are\nan investigator, we obviously need facts.\n\n192\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.519\nWe want to defeat randomness and\nhave understanding and\n\n193\n00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:43.092\nknowledge of what the particular\napproach needs to be for\n\n194\n00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:45.300\nus to be able take advantage\nof the information.\n\n195\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.928\nSo let me show you what\nwe actually do to crack\n\n196\n00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:50.850\na password that may be\ninserted into a document.\n\n197\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.450\nLet's say a PDF, for instance, or\nsomething like that, or a spreadsheet or.\n\n198\n00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.385\nWord document, whatever it may be.\n\n199\n00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.196\nHow are we gonna get it?\n\n200\n00:07:58.196 --> 00:08:00.160\nHow are we gonna have to\ntake advantage of that?\n\n201\n00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.670\nHow are we gonna use our knowledge and\n\n202\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.470\nof course some tools right,\nto be able to guess what the password is?\n\n203\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.880\nSo why don't we take a look and\nlet's see how we're gonna do that.\n\n204\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.310\nSo I've got a PDF sitting\nhere on the desk.\n\n205\n00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.910\nLet's just zoom in so you can see that.\n\n206\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.170\nIt's sitting right there and\nthat PDF is just, as you can see,\n\n207\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.440\na PDF about some stuff\nhaving to do with VM ware.\n\n208\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.970\nJust grab the PDF,\nyour little information tier sheet.\n\n209\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.860\nSet it up, when I go to open it as\nyou'll see here in just a second,\n\n210\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.760\nit asks me right for the password.\n\n211\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.570\nIt's got the please enter document\npassword security protection put on it.\n\n212\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.200\nNow I hope this works cuz I don't\nactually remember what the password is!\n\n213\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.800\nSo hopefully,\nI will actually will be able to crack this\n\n214\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.370\nbecause I have no idea what\nthe password is I put on this thing.\n\n215\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.320\nI do actually know what the password is,\nI'm only kidding.\n\n216\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.120\nSo, we can open the document and\nof course, see what it is, but\n\n217\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.550\nlet's assume for a minute we\ndon't actually know the password.\n\n218\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.440\nAs an investigator, we often don't\nknow what it is, so we can use a tool.\n\n219\n00:08:53.772 --> 00:08:54.976\nLike this tool right here.\n\n220\n00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:58.613\nLet me just move this over here and\nlet me just move the PDF over there so\n\n221\n00:08:58.613 --> 00:09:00.720\nwe can kinda see them side by side.\n\n222\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.244\nAnd you could see what\nis going on there and\n\n223\n00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:07.374\nthis tool among the many that we can use,\nAdobe password recovery.\n\n224\n00:09:07.374 --> 00:09:11.470\nThis is a tool you can get download use,\nuse it on a regular basis.\n\n225\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.385\nAnd we can go in and you can see that we\nhave the option here to take the kind\n\n226\n00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:16.966\nof attack we wanna execute.\n\n227\n00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.166\nIn this case, a brute force attack.\n\n228\n00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:22.739\nWe could specify what kind of options\nwe want, all small, all upper case,\n\n229\n00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:25.220\nlower case, letters, numbers, etc.\n\n230\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.300\nAnd we can do all that,\nwe could use special symbols,\n\n231\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.930\nwe can use spaces we could do all sorts\nof different things we can, excuse me,\n\n232\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.480\ndo a user defined item off to the right.\n\n233\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.710\nAnd use a dictionary list so\n\n234\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.670\nwe can essentially use same kind of\npassword cracking techniques that we had\n\n235\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.690\nin L0phtCrack except that L0phtCrack is\nreally focused on deriving passwords and\n\n236\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.800\nhashes or passwords from hashes and\npasswords.\n\n237\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.000\nThis is going to essentially\nattack the file,\n\n238\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.960\nthe password information in\nthe application itself, or\n\n239\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.520\nin this case in the Word document or\nPDF and then tell us what it is.\n\n240\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.480\nSo, it's gonna be a little\nslightly different approach.\n\n241\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.720\nNow, in addition, I didn't talk about\nthis when we were there, so let's just\n\n242\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.490\ngo back for a second, length, dictionary,\nkey search, auto save, options,\n\n243\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.640\nadvanced, I could specify a bunch of\ndifferent options for use with the tools.\n\n244\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.459\nSo, when we go to length for instance,\n\n245\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.680\nI could specify the number of character\nranges that I want the password to be.\n\n246\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.530\nYou want the four characters.\n\n247\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.500\nThis is a demo version of\nthe tools not fully licensed, so\n\n248\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.880\nwe're limited to doing up to four\ncharacter passwords, but in the real tool,\n\n249\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.130\nwe could do a very, very large number or\nlength of password.\n\n250\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.180\nFor dictionary, I could go in and\nI could specify the dictionary here, so\n\n251\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.100\nI can actually pull in the dictionary\nfile, like we talked about.\n\n252\n00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.810\nDepending on the kind of the attack\nI choose, I can do a key search, so\n\n253\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.680\nI can actually go in.\n\n254\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.070\nTo specify a block value and specify the\ndocument key that I want to look for, so\n\n255\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.330\nif I have a idea that maybe\na certain string was used,\n\n256\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.710\nI can do a search for that.\n\n257\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.310\nIt's all these different things right,\nnow I can also pull down and\n\n258\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.270\nI can choose different kinds of attacks,\nyou'll see there, I have a Brute-force,\n\n259\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.860\na Mask, a Dictionary or\na Key search, different options.\n\n260\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.010\nWe're just do a simple Brute-force attack,\nright?\n\n261\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.770\nBut you can go in, you could do that.\n\n262\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.390\nSo what we have to do is we have to grab\nthe PDFs and we're just gonna open that.\n\n263\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:20.410\nAnd got that right there, just pull that\nin and what it says is the following,\n\n264\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.880\njust one second let me hit the right key\ninstead of putting a value into the box.\n\n265\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.668\nIt says here's you can see this\ndocument uses strong encryption and so\n\n266\n00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:30.895\nthe the password cannot\nbe recovered instantly.\n\n267\n00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:33.995\nA lot of times a document will\nhave security involved in it but\n\n268\n00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:35.275\nthere's no complex password.\n\n269\n00:11:35.275 --> 00:11:39.465\nIt could just break it right away, this\none actually is saying, hey there's strong\n\n270\n00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:43.642\nencryption so I put encryption and\nI put password protections on this.\n\n271\n00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:47.792\nSo it's an encrypted document as well\nas a password protected document.\n\n272\n00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.632\nSo, if I know the password,\nhey, put it in below, right?\n\n273\n00:11:50.632 --> 00:11:54.262\nIf not, hey, let's start recovering and\nattack the document.\n\n274\n00:11:54.262 --> 00:11:55.162\nSo we have some options.\n\n275\n00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:58.022\nNow we're not gonna provide\nthe password cuz that would be easy,\n\n276\n00:11:58.022 --> 00:11:59.512\nwe're gonna start recovery.\n\n277\n00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:02.670\nAnd so it's gonna go through and\nit's gonna tell us hopefully.\n\n278\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.350\nAnd we'll just kinda watch it.\n\n279\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.220\nAt the bottom there you\ncan see it's working.\n\n280\n00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.610\nYou can see it's going through\nchoosing different options and saying,\n\n281\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.490\nhey this is the current password, this\nis how much time it is, average speed.\n\n282\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.620\nIt's doing almost 28,000\npasswords a second, right?\n\n283\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.410\nThat's pretty quick if you think about it.\n\n284\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.340\nThat's a lot, right,\n\n285\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.190\nif you think about the permutations that\nit's going through to be able to do.\n\n286\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.060\nNow again, to be clear,\nwe'll zoom back out and\n\n287\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.130\nsee the real time on this in a second but\nto be clear we bracketed this, right?\n\n288\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.070\nIt's only up to four letters or numbers or\na combination of letters and numbers.\n\n289\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.240\nFour characters,\nit's gonna go through that very quickly.\n\n290\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.625\nIt's a simple thought process but\nin the real world, right?\n\n291\n00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.445\nWould obviously be more complex.\n\n292\n00:12:43.445 --> 00:12:45.412\nNow what we see here is hey, look at that,\n\n293\n00:12:45.412 --> 00:12:48.415\nit's amazing what we do when we\ndo a little timelapse, right?\n\n294\n00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:50.255\nIt would be great if the real\nworld worked this way.\n\n295\n00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:53.215\nHey, just pause for five seconds,\ncome back, and look at that you're done.\n\n296\n00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:53.974\nThat's outstanding!\n\n297\n00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.480\nSo passwords successfully recovered,\nright?\n\n298\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.810\nSo it finds the password, and\nby the way you'll notice down there\n\n299\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.930\nit sees the password right,\nyou got about 41% of the way through.\n\n300\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.961\nLet me bring that over so\nthat we can see that,\n\n301\n00:13:05.961 --> 00:13:08.163\ncurrent password pas12 right there, right?\n\n302\n00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.380\nOr I could just say go full screen,\nthat would have worked too, right?\n\n303\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.880\nI forget we have the whole\nvoice control thing going on.\n\n304\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.270\nSo you could see pa12,\nI again created a simple password for\n\n305\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.020\npurposes of demonstration, right?\n\n306\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.380\nBut you could see it found\nit didn't take very long.\n\n307\n00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.900\nHow long did it take?\n\n308\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.618\nIt took 26 seconds, that's not bad right?\n\n309\n00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:27.590\nI mean that's pretty quick.\n\n310\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.770\nIf you're an investigator,\n\n311\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.640\nthat's not even enough time to get out\nof your time right that's pretty quick.\n\n312\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.080\nNow in the reality in the real\nworld would it be that easy, maybe.\n\n313\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.910\nI mean will people just may use\na simple password, it's hard to say.\n\n314\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.840\nWould I normally use\na password that's simple?\n\n315\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.330\nI would use a more complex password.\n\n316\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.430\n&gt;&gt; I actually work in a place where\nthe domain administrator password was,\n\n317\n00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.200\neach desk in the password was help.\n\n318\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.470\nAs domain admin account.\n\n319\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.760\n&gt;&gt; We're going to talk about those stupid\ndefault and simple passwords in a minute.\n\n320\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.990\nI'm gonna show you some websites where\nyou can get listings of default passwords\n\n321\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.300\nbased on vendor specifications, right.\n\n322\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.830\nSo defaultpassword.com and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n323\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.140\nWhere we can find the heat\nof that kind of stuff and\n\n324\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.890\nuse those obviously if necessary.\n\n325\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.650\nBut you can see here how many\npasswords do we have to try?\n\n326\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.200\nAlmost 750,000 to get that.\n\n327\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n328\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.975\n&gt;&gt; Now again, at 27,000 approximately\na second, you do the math,\n\n329\n00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:15.393\nthat doesn't take very long.\n\n330\n00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:17.053\n[CROSSTALK] That doesn't take very long.\n\n331\n00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:20.415\nBut it took almost 27 seconds,26 seconds,\n\n332\n00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:24.110\n742 milliseconds,\nif we want to be precise.\n\n333\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.160\nAnd average password speed was\nabout 28,000 passwords per second.\n\n334\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.200\nAnd this is a pretty cranking tool,\nno pun intended.\n\n335\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.830\nRight, so we did get the password.\n\n336\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.820\nWe got the password for\nthe user file, you can see pa12.\n\n337\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.090\nWe also got it in HEX, in case you wanna\nwalk around and use that as your password.\n\n338\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:40.730\nAnd you know what?\n\n339\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.560\nAll kidding aside, I've seen this\nbefore where people will generate\n\n340\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.540\na normal password, convert it to hex, and\nthen use the hex string for the password.\n\n341\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.260\nPeople think that's more complex.\n\n342\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.450\nYeah, it's more complex for\nyou to put in but\n\n343\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.870\nif we're doing an alphanumeric search,\nwe're probably gonna find that password.\n\n344\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.240\nYou remember, another movie random aside,\nI lied, we're gonna have two this episode.\n\n345\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.200\nCuz I can do that, that's how\nwe're gonna roll in this episode.\n\n346\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.477\nYou remember in WarGames?\n\n347\n00:15:04.477 --> 00:15:07.530\nWhere at the very end of WarGames, right?\n\n348\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.960\nYou're in the command center and\nthe password is starting to go up, or\n\n349\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.750\nthe launch code is starting\nto go up on the screen.\n\n350\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.960\nSo the whopper computer is doing the whole\nhey we're gonna launch the missile thing,\n\n351\n00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.650\nspoiler alert by the way right.\n\n352\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.780\nNo nuclear war, everything works out okay.\n\n353\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.180\nBut they are putting the password\nof the launch code up,\n\n354\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.570\nand the woman is saying okay, and\nthey got another one, and another one.\n\n355\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.310\nAnd they're showing it go through, and you\nsee the actual launch code on the console,\n\n356\n00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.740\nthey have it there like\nT01 whatever it is.\n\n357\n00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.940\nAnd you see it guessing it.\n\n358\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.671\nBut you know, we talked about reality in\nTV shows and movies when we were offline\n\n359\n00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:44.514\ntalking about Mr. Robot, Dan and I were\nchatting a little bit between sessions,\n\n360\n00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:47.602\nand you made the point of say hey\nit's a really realistic series.\n\n361\n00:15:47.602 --> 00:15:49.800\nThey go out of their way, right,\nto try and make it realistic.\n\n362\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.391\nAnd we talked about the fact that\nsometimes it doesn't look realistic when\n\n363\n00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.868\nthey do this in the movies Yet what you\nlook at what they did in War Games and\n\n364\n00:15:56.868 --> 00:16:00.687\nlook at how they did it, it's not an\naccurate representation of what a password\n\n365\n00:16:00.687 --> 00:16:02.860\ncrack or finding that would actually be.\n\n366\n00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.510\nBecause you see the password\ncodes going through each.\n\n367\n00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.600\nIt's almost like hangman,\nthey got the little lines.\n\n368\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.070\nBut you see the right letters and\n\n369\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.900\nnumbers coming up as it's\niterating through the options.\n\n370\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.340\nBut yet, it's taking so\nlong to guess each one.\n\n371\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.730\nBecause obviously they're\nmaking it more dramatic.\n\n372\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.490\nWhat it would have done is\neither done the whole string and\n\n373\n00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.290\nthen actually put the whole string in.\n\n374\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.307\nIt wouldn't have cracked it one.\n\n375\n00:16:25.307 --> 00:16:25.978\n&gt;&gt; At a time.\n\n376\n00:16:25.978 --> 00:16:27.490\n&gt;&gt; An item like that.\nIt's just that's not how you see it,\n\n377\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.600\nit's not how it works.\n\n378\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.834\nSo it is not actually an accurate\nrepresentation, even though it looks like\n\n379\n00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:34.970\nmy God, they're almost there,\nthey're gonna get the launch code.\n\n380\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.630\nIt's not really done that way, right?\n\n381\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.490\nI mean, you can see it's the whole string\nas you saw me do it here that comes up.\n\n382\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.055\nAnd it's that string that we zero in on,\nand say okay, that's the entire string.\n\n383\n00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:45.435\nSo it would have been the whole\nthing coming up as opposed to\n\n384\n00:16:45.435 --> 00:16:46.065\nindividual characters.\n\n385\n00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:49.980\nSo we wanna point that out sometimes\nwhen we see those inaccuracies.\n\n386\n00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.510\nJust to make sure we know what's going on.\n\n387\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.355\n&gt;&gt; Now you too can nitpick\nmovies from the 80's.\n\n388\n00:16:54.355 --> 00:16:55.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or from anytime.\n\n389\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.590\nNot just the 80's.\n\n390\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.120\nI can easily do that in\nthe movies of the modern day.\n\n391\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're getting a whole\nlot better as time progressed and\n\n392\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.135\ntechnology is more ubiquitous.\n\n393\n00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:05.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in some respects but\n\n394\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.360\nthen you get some real stinkers\nthat are great special effects but\n\n395\n00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.670\njust no better than the other ones, right?\n\n396\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.120\nSo, yeah, it just depends.\n\n397\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.610\nAll right, so you'll see,\nlet's go back here if we could.\n\n398\n00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.440\nSo you'll see that once we've done that,\nit's zoomed out,\n\n399\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.290\nlet me zoom back in, you could see\nthat we now have the password, right?\n\n400\n00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.210\nSo I could, right, just go in and\nI could decrypt it, I could save it.\n\n401\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.640\nSo let's just hit OK there.\n\n402\n00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.570\nLet's minimize that,\nlet's take our knowledge of the password,\n\n403\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.690\nlet's give it a try, right?\n\n404\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.060\nSo if we do pa12, hit OK,\nand boom, there we go.\n\n405\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.970\nSo the document is now essentially\nopen and available to us.\n\n406\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:41.100\nSo it wouldn't be hard to be able to do\nthe same thing using an Excel spreadsheet,\n\n407\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.710\nPowerPoint slide deck, Word document,\nAccess database, you name it.\n\n408\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.250\nAnything that has a password on it,\nwe may not use that tool,\n\n409\n00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.680\nthat tool specific to Adobe PDFs.\n\n410\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.440\nBut there are tools like that that will\nwork for Excel or for any other things,\n\n411\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.030\nyou just have to go out and find them.\n\n412\n00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.960\nAnd we could crack the passwords and\nessentially derive them.\n\n413\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.560\nAnd this is what we do,\nwe have computers that do this.\n\n414\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.720\nWe may script and automate some of this,\nbut we essentially go through and\n\n415\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.490\nthis is what we spend time on.\n\n416\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.820\nNow I promised you I would show you\nsome sites where we can find default\n\n417\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.840\npassword lists.\n\n418\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.370\nLet's take a look at some of those,\ngot a few of them lined up for you.\n\n419\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.290\nAlso I wanna talk about how we bypass\npasswords in the BIOS, believe it or not.\n\n420\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.980\nLittle going back to basics, doing a\nlittle hacking on the hardware side to get\n\n421\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.430\ninto the machine if it has\na boot up password in the BIOS.\n\n422\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.920\nSo we're gonna take\na look at how to do that,\n\n423\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.490\ntalk to you about that in just a minute.\n\n424\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.265\nI've just got a little search up there\nthat I did to show you some of that.\n\n425\n00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:33.395\nBut let's go in and let's take a look\nat some of these default password lists\n\n426\n00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:36.555\nthat are available out there and some\nof the sites that will let us do this.\n\n427\n00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:38.671\nSo an oldie but a goodie,\nit's been around for a long time.\n\n428\n00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:42.662\nDefaultpassword.com, you can\nget a list as you can see here.\n\n429\n00:18:42.662 --> 00:18:47.232\nBrowse by alphabetized\nlisting of 812 passwords.\n\n430\n00:18:47.232 --> 00:18:50.652\nWe have manufacturers,\nyou have 3COM there for instance.\n\n431\n00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:55.798\nAnd if you're using,\nlet's say hypothetically the I don't know,\n\n432\n00:18:55.798 --> 00:18:59.369\nthe 3COM SuperStack Switch,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n433\n00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:04.766\nYou could see that, that password is\ngonna be multi right there, right?\n\n434\n00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:07.076\nAnd so\nit shows you what the password is and\n\n435\n00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:10.476\ntells you the user as well\nas the password, right?\n\n436\n00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:16.640\nSo if we did let's say hypothetically,\nJust highlight down there.\n\n437\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.530\nIt looks like the user, so\nI can just scroll in so\n\n438\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.700\nyou can see it a little better.\n\n439\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.070\nLooks like the protocol is multiple,\nso it's ports multiple.\n\n440\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.300\nUser's called security,\npassword's called security.\n\n441\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.440\nSo security, security.\n\n442\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.730\nYou were saying something like help desk,\nhelp or whatever it was.\n\n443\n00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.530\nThat's what the default\nvendor-installed password and\n\n444\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.090\nusername would be if you don't\nchange it on this device.\n\n445\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.960\nThat's what these lists show you.\n\n446\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.383\nAnd then they've got a whole bunch,\nnot just 3COM, right?\n\n447\n00:19:40.383 --> 00:19:42.510\nI mean,\nthey've got all sorts of vendors in here.\n\n448\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.653\nDell, DEC, right, when was the last time\nyou saw Digital Equipment stuff, right?\n\n449\n00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:47.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you got all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n450\n00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:49.660\nHewlett-Packard, IBM, right?\n\n451\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.951\nYou know there's Intel, there's Linksys,\nthere's Lucent, Cisco is on here, McAfee,\n\n452\n00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:59.695\nNetgear, Microsoft, right,\nall sorts of stuff, Novell, right,\n\n453\n00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:01.044\nthere's a popular one.\n\n454\n00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:03.540\nYou wanna obviously go out and find those.\n\n455\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.910\nNow again clearly some of these sites\nare going to have older information.\n\n456\n00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.861\n&gt;&gt; Gotta update that CNA, right?\n\n457\n00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:09.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n458\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.650\nthe only Novell work I do is migration\nwork, is what I used to say.\n\n459\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.330\nA CNA and a CNE.\n\n460\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.540\nBut we also have another one, cirt.net.\n\n461\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.380\nThey've got the cool alien little\nlogo going on there, mister gray guy.\n\n462\n00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.860\nSo cirt.net/passwords, another good site.\n\n463\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.030\nYou can go out and take a look.\n\n464\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.630\nThey got default passwords there.\n\n465\n00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.370\nLooks like about 500 vendors,\nabout 2,000 passwords.\n\n466\n00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.150\nGot a little search engine going on there.\n\n467\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.230\nYou got it by vendor.\n\n468\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.310\nSo again we can just scroll down,\nlook at the vendor list and say, yeah.\n\n469\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.330\nLet's go check out Check Point.\n\n470\n00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.140\nSo let's do Check Point.\n\n471\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.580\nAnd they've got some\ndifferent models here, right.\n\n472\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.910\nAnd if we just choose let's say\nSG R70 hypothetically, right?\n\n473\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.900\nSlightly newer although it is\nstill an older version model.\n\n474\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.720\nYou can see User ID, admin, Password,\nadminadmin, cuz that's always a good one.\n\n475\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.276\nYou wanna repeat it cuz it's\nnot good the first time,\n\n476\n00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.970\nit's only good if you to use it twice,\nright?\n\n477\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.260\nAnd it gives you administrative\nlevel logon capabilities and\n\n478\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.490\nit gives you typically what the default\nURL is through the web interface.\n\n479\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.508\nIn this case, it's 192.168.1.1, you\nwould get the web interface, the logon.\n\n480\n00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:19.906\nYou would then be able to go in, provide\nadmin, adminadmin, and have admin or\n\n481\n00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:23.470\nadministrator level rights\ninto the interface, right?\n\n482\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.820\nSo you got a system like this.\n\n483\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.830\nOne more for you,\nit's called DefaultPassword.\n\n484\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.310\nSo this one is default-password.info.\n\n485\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.960\nAgain, there's hundreds of them out there.\n\n486\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.708\nI just did a random search and\ncame up with a few of them.\n\n487\n00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:40.690\nAnd we can see again, if we go down,\ndo some searching here.\n\n488\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.205\nThis one, let's go in.\n\n489\n00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:45.320\nLet's do a little Cisco this time.\n\n490\n00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.420\nAnd so what do we got?\n\n491\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.080\nI actually just read Cisco's\ngetting rid of their ACS product.\n\n492\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.630\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.020\nThey're gonna get rid of it and\nthey're doing,\n\n494\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.150\nI guess they're bringing security back\ninto the switch infrastructure itself.\n\n495\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.712\nThey're gonna get rid of the external\ncontrol system that they use for security.\n\n496\n00:21:58.712 --> 00:22:00.404\nSo kinda interesting.\n\n497\n00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:03.217\nGot some oldies but goodies,\nlittle 2600 series going on there.\n\n498\n00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:06.458\nGot some caching engine, call manager.\n\n499\n00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.460\nThat may be a popular one.\n\n500\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.650\nGot some wireless stuff.\n\n501\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.950\nGot a whole bunch of different ones.\n\n502\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.667\nLet's just say PIX Firewall, there we go.\n\n503\n00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.056\nAll right, so\nif we do the PIX Firewall it's got,\n\n504\n00:22:17.056 --> 00:22:20.100\nlet's see what they got listed there.\n\n505\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.604\nSo it's got User name none, password,\nyou gotta click show me to see it,\n\n506\n00:22:23.604 --> 00:22:24.880\nuser access Telnet.\n\n507\n00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:31.529\nSo, I guess click there, right,\ndefault password is cisco, right?\n\n508\n00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:35.600\nSo, obviously not too difficult\nto figure that one out, right?\n\n509\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.280\nAnd that may very well get you in.\n\n510\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.330\nSo there's lots of these sites out there.\n\n511\n00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.440\nHow up to date are they?\n\n512\n00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.410\nHard to say.\n\n513\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.390\nI just randomly picked a few off\na Google search list and said hey,\n\n514\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.310\nlet's just show a couple so you get\na sense of the fact they are out there.\n\n515\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.324\nAre you gonna have to do a little due\ndiligence, exercise a little due care, do\n\n516\n00:22:50.324 --> 00:22:53.539\na little research, come up with some sites\nyou feel are a little bit more accurate.\n\n517\n00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:55.015\nThese sites are accurate,\n\n518\n00:22:55.015 --> 00:22:59.250\nit's just that the information may be old\nbecause a lot of these products may no\n\n519\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.330\nlonger be in market or they may have\nupdated versions, some of them.\n\n520\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.650\nThe vendors are not stupid, right?\n\n521\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.660\nThey know this stuff gets out there.\n\n522\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.929\nI mean, look, it's in their documentation.\n\n523\n00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:10.533\nSo when they ship the product, they say,\nokay, here is the default username and\n\n524\n00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:12.140\npassword so you can get in.\n\n525\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.660\nSo obviously they provide\nthis information.\n\n526\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.740\nIt's not like we went in and\nhacked the deep, dark vaults at Cisco.\n\n527\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; To figure\nout how to tell you what it is.\n\n528\n00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:20.435\nSo it's out there.\n\n529\n00:23:20.435 --> 00:23:24.940\nThe challenge is not that vendors provide\nthis information, cuz it's easy to find.\n\n530\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.440\nThe challenge is that people that\nimplement these systems that don't change\n\n531\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.330\nthese defaults present\na significant security risk.\n\n532\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.620\nAnd obviously as an investigator,\nwe're betting on the fact and\n\n533\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.840\nhoping that a person has not done this.\n\n534\n00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.090\nSo that way we can then use this\nbasic information to get in.\n\n535\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.000\nBut at the same time I always have\na twinge of regret when I see this.\n\n536\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I do this, right?\n\n537\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.193\nBecause I'm thinking had they just done\n\n538\n00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:49.878\nthe obvious thing, change the username and\npassword, I probably wouldn't be sitting\n\n539\n00:23:49.878 --> 00:23:53.262\nhere having to do what I'm doing in the\nfirst place, because they wouldn't have\n\n540\n00:23:53.262 --> 00:23:55.920\ngotten hacked and broken into.\nIf you think about the logic of it.\n\n541\n00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.632\nSo I'm a little bit concerned, right?\n\n542\n00:23:58.632 --> 00:23:59.222\nI'm always,\n\n543\n00:23:59.222 --> 00:24:02.576\nI've got a little bit of of remorse,\nright, for the individual or the company.\n\n544\n00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:03.319\nBecause I say,\n\n545\n00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:07.149\nhey, had they just known a little better,\nhad somebody stopped and told them,\n\n546\n00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:11.364\nthen I wouldn't necessarily be doing this.\nI honestly would rather be not working as\n\n547\n00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:14.992\nhard and have you be more secure than I\nwould be having to work as hard as I do\n\n548\n00:24:14.992 --> 00:24:18.085\nto figure out what goes wrong in\na system when people don't act\n\n549\n00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:20.955\nwith the proper due diligence and\ndue care.\n\n550\n00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:22.799\nAs an investigator,\nthat's what I'm thinking.\n\n551\n00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:25.799\nBut then, at the same time,\nI'm thinking but reality is what it is.\n\n552\n00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.845\nSomebody's gotta clean up the mess, right?\n\n553\n00:24:27.845 --> 00:24:31.386\nMight as well be somebody who's trained,\nwho's qualified, who's a CHFI,\n\n554\n00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:34.393\nhopefully somebody like you after\nyou take and pass your exam, and\n\n555\n00:24:34.393 --> 00:24:36.070\ncan put these skills to use, right?\n\n556\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.110\nSo it is important for\nus to think about that.\n\n557\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.240\nSo let's talk about the last\nlittle item on our list,\n\n558\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.020\nbypassing the BIOS\npasswords in the system.\n\n559\n00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.387\nNow, a lot of times\nhardware-based systems,\n\n560\n00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:49.180\nas if there were not\nhardware-based systems, right?\n\n561\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.430\nEverything has hardware running\nunderneath it at some point.\n\n562\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.250\nBut what I mean is a traditional,\n\n563\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.980\nphysical system as opposed to a virtual\nmachine where we don't tend to put\n\n564\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.800\nBIOS passwords on the VM itself, we put\nthem on the physical underlying host.\n\n565\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.850\nBut a lot of times, and\nthis is an old school mechanism,\n\n566\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.450\na lot of people don't really think\nabout BIOS passwords anymore.\n\n567\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.030\nA lot people don't use them.\n\n568\n00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.020\nBut they're becoming popular again because\nwe don't want people being able to gain\n\n569\n00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.380\nphysical access to the host and\nbe able to reset it.\n\n570\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.520\nSo if you do reset it,\nyou're locked out, right?\n\n571\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.660\nThis is a boot up password, essentially.\n\n572\n00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.500\nA full drive encryption is\nin something like BitLocker,\n\n573\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.630\nas technology would of\nthis do this as well.\n\n574\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.634\nWe have to put in a boot up password\nto unencrypt the drive to be able to\n\n575\n00:25:26.634 --> 00:25:27.450\nboot it up.\n\n576\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.755\nSo there's lots of ways\nwe could see happening.\n\n577\n00:25:29.755 --> 00:25:32.980\nBut BIOS passwords are an oldie but\na goodie.\n\n578\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.313\nDo you know, Daniel, are you familiar with\nthe thought process that if we do put\n\n579\n00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:40.110\na BIOS password in,\nis it something we can bypass?\n\n580\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.190\n&gt;&gt; It is something you can bypass,\ntypically.\n\n581\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:48.590\nI've seen it's more difficultly\nimplemented, especially when it comes to\n\n582\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.030\nlaptops because that can be a little more\ndifficult to get to the hardware of it.\n\n583\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.440\nBut that's typically how\nyou would do these things,\n\n584\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.870\nis jump into some hardware hacking\nactually to bypass these passwords.\n\n585\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.540\n&gt;&gt; You would, and so Daniel makes a great\npoint, which is the best way to do this,\n\n586\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.320\nother than knowing the password of course,\nright?\n\n587\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.240\nIs simply, and believe it or\nnot, it actually is this simple.\n\n588\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.950\nYou pull out the CMOS battery.\n\n589\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.110\nAnd this is an old school trick.\n\n590\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.910\nYou may not know this.\n\n591\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.140\nYou may not even know what a CMOS battery\nis because you might not have ever\n\n592\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.240\nactually looked at one.\n\n593\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.036\nAnd to Daniel's point,\n\n594\n00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:20.050\nin a laptop and a mobile device,\nit may actually be impossible to get to.\n\n595\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.610\nBut in physical desktop servers and\nmachines, you normally can open them up,\n\n596\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.100\nyou can get to the motherboard,\nyou can take out the BIOS battery,\n\n597\n00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.680\nthe CMOS battery.\n\n598\n00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.770\nIf you take that out for 10 minutes,\nyou actually will reset and\n\n599\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.280\nloose whatever the password is.\n\n600\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.000\nAnd you can then just simply\nget into the machine.\n\n601\n00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.610\nSo it may be as simple as literally\npopping the battery out of that\n\n602\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.175\nthing, right?\n\n603\n00:26:38.175 --> 00:26:40.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just letting it sit for a while.\n\n604\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.760\nWe make the point, we talk about this,\n\n605\n00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.605\nthat it's rare you need to get into\nthe BIOS itself to investigate a machine.\n\n606\n00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:49.725\nBecause if all you're doing is looking to\nget to the data on the drive, while you're\n\n607\n00:26:49.725 --> 00:26:52.625\nopening the thing and pulling the battery\nout, why not just pull the hard drive out?\n\n608\n00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:55.115\nJust go hook it up somewhere else and\ninvestigate it.\n\n609\n00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:55.715\nYou could do that.\n\n610\n00:26:55.715 --> 00:26:57.155\nYou don't need the BIOS\npassword to do that.\n\n611\n00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:58.840\nIt's not gonna protect the hard drive.\n\n612\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.070\nIt's protecting the physical hardware and\nthe settings of it in the BIOS.\n\n613\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.960\nBut on occasion we may\nwanna go into the BIOS and\n\n614\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.780\nsee what's there in case there's been\nclock manipulation, things like that.\n\n615\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.800\nWe may wanna look at that.\n\n616\n00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.560\nIf we wanna get in and see that, we have\nto be able to get the BIOS password or\n\n617\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.560\nreset it.\n\n618\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.390\nProblem is, in resetting it by\npulling out the CMOS battery and\n\n619\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.720\nresetting the password,\n\n620\n00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.120\nwe sometimes run the risk of the factory\ndefaults being reapplied to the BIOS.\n\n621\n00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.990\nAnd as a result, we may actually lose\nwhatever modifications have been done.\n\n622\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.960\nSo we just have to understand that it's\nnot always a foolproof method to get in.\n\n623\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.790\nIt will get us in-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n624\n00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.410\n&gt;&gt; But it may not show us what\nwe wanna see, in other words,\n\n625\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.260\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n626\n00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.910\nBut hacking the BIOS may be\nnothing more than just literally\n\n627\n00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.190\npopping the battery out for,\nusually it's about 10 minutes on average.\n\n628\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.430\nAnd if you do that,\nit usually resets with no trouble.\n\n629\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.110\nSo kind of an interesting little quirk,\nbut\n\n630\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.710\nsomething that, again,\nmay of interest to us to know.\n\n631\n00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.410\n&gt;&gt; Had to do it before, plenty of times.\n\n632\n00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nAgain,\n\n633\n00:27:50.216 --> 00:27:53.546\nit's one of those things where if you\nlock yourself out, back in the day,\n\n634\n00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:56.876\nwe used to put BIOS passwords on machines\nso somebody couldn't walk up and\n\n635\n00:27:56.876 --> 00:27:58.240\nactually reconfigure them.\n\n636\n00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.956\nAnd as result, if you didn't\nknow what the BIOS password was,\n\n637\n00:28:00.956 --> 00:28:03.160\nyou had to actually\nreset it to get back in.\n\n638\n00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.840\nA lot of people didn't\nrealize you could do that,\n\n639\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.520\nbut that is actually something we can do.\n\n640\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:13.530\n&gt;&gt; I've had to actually use the BIOS, talk\nabout system time to, and in an active\n\n641\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:18.030\ndirectly environmental, and a lot of\nenvironments, the time is very important.\n\n642\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.570\nIf the time is off by a certain amount,\nyou won't be able to log in.\n\n643\n00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:25.230\nAnd if you have a valid username, yeah,\nthen I can DOS somebody that way.\n\n644\n00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.460\nAnd you have to have\nthe user go into the BIOS,\n\n645\n00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.770\nchange the system time back to what it\nshould be, or close to what it is anyway.\n\n646\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.620\nAnd that way they can log in.\n\n647\n00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.130\nIt can be a pain in the keester,\n\n648\n00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.340\nbut something that you\nmay actually have to do.\n\n649\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.310\nSo it's a good little tool\nto have in the belt there.\n\n650\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just kinda one of those\nold school knowledge items, right,\n\n651\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.590\nthat we don't often hear about and\n\n652\n00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.930\ntalk about a lot today just because we've\nkinda moved past a lot of this stuff.\n\n653\n00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.380\nAnd the reality is we focus on technology\nto slightly different level today.\n\n654\n00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.770\nA lot of Cloud related stuff,\na lot of virtualization related stuff.\n\n655\n00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.930\nWe don't spend as much time thinking\nabout the end point as a physical host or\n\n656\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:02.940\na physical item.\n\n657\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.710\nBut rather, we just really talk about\nthe information contained within it and\n\n658\n00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.860\nhow we investigate it.\n\n659\n00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.550\nThat's really been the theme\nof everything we've talked\n\n660\n00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.330\nabout in all the episodes until now.\n\n661\n00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.085\nAnd it continues to be.\n\n662\n00:29:11.085 --> 00:29:14.530\nAnd I'm not suggesting it's not\nan accurate way of representing the way we\n\n663\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.181\ndeal with system forensics today.\n\n664\n00:29:16.181 --> 00:29:18.646\nBut sometimes,\neven though it's real old school and\n\n665\n00:29:18.646 --> 00:29:22.647\nyou may have forgotten that knowledge,\nright, that's the knowledge that sometimes\n\n666\n00:29:22.647 --> 00:29:26.130\nis gonna be the critical piece of\nthe puzzle, the thing that we gotta know.\n\n667\n00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.420\nAnd if you haven't done this for a certain\namount of time and just don't have\n\n668\n00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.730\na background with certain historical\nlandmarkers, right, along the journey\n\n669\n00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.110\non the road to understanding how to be a\nforensic investigator, this is that tribal\n\n670\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.620\nknowledge, right, that kinda passed down\ngenerational knowledge that you may miss.\n\n671\n00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.100\nI've talked about some things,\nodds and ends, in certain shows,\n\n672\n00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.180\nlike resetting the MBR using\na boot disk years ago.\n\n673\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.720\nYou just don't really do that today.\n\n674\n00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.244\nI mean, I can't remember the last\ntime I had to do that on a machine.\n\n675\n00:29:53.244 --> 00:29:56.904\nBut I know how to do it because I had to\ndo it years ago, every time I would do\n\n676\n00:29:56.904 --> 00:30:01.140\nan install, right, when I was\nbuilding machines on a regular basis.\n\n677\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.913\nAnd as a trainer years ago, as a Microsoft\ntrainer, or just as a develop trainer\n\n678\n00:30:04.913 --> 00:30:08.629\nwhatever, when I would go in and have to\nbuild lab environments from scratch in\n\n679\n00:30:08.629 --> 00:30:12.401\nthe good old days were being an MCT meant\nyou set up 48 hours worth the stuff to do\n\n680\n00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:15.490\na class that everybody been broke\nlike on the first day, right?\n\n681\n00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.771\nSo, you had to do this all\nthe old fashioned way.\n\n682\n00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:19.510\nYou built Machines from scratch.\n\n683\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.060\nWhen you had to do that, and\nreimage machines on a regular basis,\n\n684\n00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.865\nyou had to reset those master\nboot records all the time.\n\n685\n00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:28.320\nMVR fix was like\na standard control tool or\n\n686\n00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.130\ncommand line tool that we would use in\norder to be able to do this kind of stuff.\n\n687\n00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.930\nAnd I think we've lost a lot of that\ncontinuity of that old school knowledge\n\n688\n00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.980\nfor many of the newer practitioners today,\ncuz you just don't come online and\n\n689\n00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.915\nstart to do the stuff and\nsee systems that way.\n\n690\n00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:44.830\nThey're just not operated\nthat way anymore.\n\n691\n00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.539\nAnd I'm not suggesting that means you\ndon't have the knowledge you need to be\n\n692\n00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:48.045\nsuccessful.\n\n693\n00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:51.644\nI'm just pointing out that on the rare\noccasion you come up against an old\n\n694\n00:30:51.644 --> 00:30:55.656\nmachine where you may not be able to use\nthe standard tools you're used to using,\n\n695\n00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.902\ncuz they don't work,\nbecause they're not supported, right,\n\n696\n00:30:58.902 --> 00:31:02.960\nbecause they're just of a generation\nthat won't run on that machine.\n\n697\n00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.260\nYou have to have some of these old tricks\nup your sleeves to be able to essentially\n\n698\n00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.880\nfigure out how to get around\nthe problem and still make it work.\n\n699\n00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.120\nSo it is kind of interesting.\n\n700\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.040\n&gt;&gt; Very true, very true.\n\n701\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.650\nAnd that being said, I think that\nrounds us out for password cracking.\n\n702\n00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.870\nHopefully you guys have gotten\na lot out of this episode.\n\n703\n00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.860\nIt's a lot of fun to do\nbecause it's something active,\n\n704\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.330\nyou're actually doing something.\n\n705\n00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.367\nAnd you're kind of breaking the system\nthere, and getting around and\n\n706\n00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:27.540\nyou're acting like a hacker\nwhich is always fun.\n\n707\n00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.670\nAnd you get to do it in a way\nthat's not gonna land you\n\n708\n00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.210\nbehind bars with a cell-mate.\n\n709\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.470\nThat's never fun.\n\n710\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.590\nThat being said, Adam, thanks for\nshowing us how to do password crackers,\n\n711\n00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.850\nhow to work with them, what to expect,\ntechniques and concepts behind them.\n\n712\n00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.700\nAnd we thank you guys for watching, but\nit's that time again to sign off

00:00:10.797\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:13.448\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:17.190\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.460\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and of course\nwe're here for some more on CHFI series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.150\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain,\n\n8\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.100\nour mentor in this whole process,\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.910\nAdam, welcome back sir, how art thou?\n\n10\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.245\n&gt;&gt; Namaste, namaste.\n\n11\n00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.285\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So everything is good,\n\n12\n00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.200\nhopefully everybody is well out there.\n\n13\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.555\nWe're gonna continue\ntalking as we always do.\n\n14\n00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:37.735\nDo I ever show up and not talk?\n\n15\n00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:39.857\nI mean, that's like the eternal-\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna pantomime this whole\n\n16\n00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:40.385\nepisode [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:41.075\n&gt;&gt; I could do that.\n\n18\n00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.962\nWe could, I think we had this\nconversation at one point,\n\n19\n00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.775\nabout the movie with the cue cards.\n\n20\n00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.505\nI still don't remember what\nthe name of that movie was.\n\n21\n00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.645\nBut I could just do the cue cards.\n\n22\n00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:49.459\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and just drop them.\n\n23\n00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:53.308\n&gt;&gt; Just show them up and just,\nanyway we're not gonna do that,\n\n24\n00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:54.520\nwe are gonna talk.\n\n25\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.560\nSo we're gonna actually\nturn this into what we\n\n26\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.940\nlovingly here at ITProTV\nrefer to as a demonstration.\n\n27\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.870\nSo we're gonna actually show you\nsome things about log capturing and\n\n28\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.960\na little bit of network forensics.\n\n29\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.460\nThat'll be good before we really\nget deeply into this discussion.\n\n30\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.660\nIt just sets some parameters and\ngeneral boundaries.\n\n31\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.350\nSo the idea that we're gonna illustrate\nhere as we take a look at some event logs,\n\n32\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.500\ntake a look at how to capture\na little bit of network traffic,\n\n33\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.120\nis where does information not only come\nfrom, but where does it reside, right?\n\n34\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.770\nIn other words, we do so\nmany things as we go through and\n\n35\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.880\nthink about the logic of how\nwe investigate information,\n\n36\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.480\nhow we investigate activities, how we\nsee records of things that have gone on.\n\n37\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.000\nWe obviously as investigators have\nto have knowledge of this, right?\n\n38\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.720\nWe have to know about log files,\nwe have to know that certain information,\n\n39\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.090\nexcuse me,\nthat's gonna be stored in certain places.\n\n40\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.940\nAnd we have to make sure that we\nknow that when we are thinking about\n\n41\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.950\nwhere to look and what to do,\nthat we go to the right place.\n\n42\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.540\nAnd so for instance, do you know Daniel,\nif you don't mind me asking.\n\n43\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Sure, go ahead.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know what or\n\n44\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.039\nwhere most logs are stored in Windows?\n\n45\n00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.370\n&gt;&gt; In Windows in the event logs.\n\n46\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.440\n&gt;&gt; In the event logs, right?\n\n47\n00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.200\nAnd now I know in a prior episode we\nactually showed you the path to the event\n\n48\n00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.060\nlogs, we actually went through,\ntook a look at where they are.\n\n49\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.120\nAnd we'll remind you of that\nin the demo here in a minute.\n\n50\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.600\nBut Andrew,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.690\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, right,\n\n52\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.930\nis absolutely correct, right?\n\n53\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.050\nThey are stored in the event logs, but\nthe event logs, plural, there are over\n\n54\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.730\n30 of them in a modern Windows system, are\ngoing to have a variety of information.\n\n55\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.340\nThey're gonna have a .edt extension for\nevent logs.\n\n56\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.170\nNow can we view those with\nthe standard event log viewer?\n\n57\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.500\nAbsolutely, we do it all the time.\n\n58\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.528\nAre there other programs that allow\nus to view those log files as well?\n\n59\n00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:35.335\nAbsolutely, we're gonna show you one\nthat you may be interested in using.\n\n60\n00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.930\nThere's no reason not to use event viewer\nbut what if you're running on a machine\n\n61\n00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.300\nthat may not support\nthe use of event viewer and\n\n62\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.210\nyou want to look at the information\nforensically outside of that environment,\n\n63\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.830\nyou could use a tool like\nthis to be able to do that.\n\n64\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat where logs come from,\n\n65\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.330\nwhat kind of information\nwe can find in there,\n\n66\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.020\nwe're also gonna take a look at how to\ncapture some raw packets on the network.\n\n67\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.310\nI use a tool called Network Analyzer,\nan interesting tool that I often use\n\n68\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.100\nthat is going to be free\nas we often talk about.\n\n69\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.210\nI'll let you see that.\n\n70\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.715\nIt's the equivalent of Network Monitor,\n\n71\n00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:08.530\nany of the capture programs like\nWire Shark that we can use, and\n\n72\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.940\nit's gonna give us detailed\ninformation about packets.\n\n73\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.790\nAnd then we can start to examine them,\nbreak them down and\n\n74\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.070\ntake a look at what goes on in them.\n\n75\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.470\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look at some stuff we can do.\n\n76\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.900\nWhat I thought we would start out\nwith is just reminding ourselves\n\n77\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.420\nof the Windows environment,\ntaking a look at the event logs.\n\n78\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.480\nLet me just open this up\nbefore we zoom in here.\n\n79\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.360\nAnd we'll just take a look at all\nthe different log files that are,\n\n80\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.720\nor potentially logs that are available.\n\n81\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.950\nAnd so as we scroll in and\n\n82\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.230\nwe look at the event viewer what we can\nsee is we have Application, Security,\n\n83\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.810\nSystem, all the standard logs, right,\nthat we're often used to seeing.\n\n84\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.355\nWe have a Setup log,\nwe have a Forwarded Events log, we\n\n85\n00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.505\ndon't tend to look at the Set Up log very\noften after the systems up and running.\n\n86\n00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:50.075\nWe have Applications and\nServices, we have Hardware, IE,\n\n87\n00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:54.885\nInternet Explorer, the KMS for a domain\ncontroller with key management system.\n\n88\n00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:57.105\nThen we have our Windows and\nthen under Windows,\n\n89\n00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:01.225\nyou can see there's a very large number\nof folders as we go down alphabetically,\n\n90\n00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:07.490\nDHCP, DNS would be there if we're running\nDNS, Ad Blocker, all the applications\n\n91\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.560\nthat may be running in Windows that\nwill require logging are gonna be there.\n\n92\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.520\nNow a lot of these folders may not\nhave any entries inside of them\n\n93\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.510\ncuz we're not using\nthat service right now.\n\n94\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.720\nBut as we start to use it we\nwill find information there.\n\n95\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.070\nAnd so we could drill in and\nwe can obviously go take a look.\n\n96\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.090\nAnd if we go and we take a look at\nthe Application log, for instance,\n\n97\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.020\nhypothetically, and goody,\nwe got an error up top there, so\n\n98\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.978\nthat may tell us something.\n\n99\n00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:33.280\nWe go in and we take a look and\nwe can see day and time stamps, we can see\n\n100\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.110\ninformation about source code, where's\nstuff coming from, we can see event IDs.\n\n101\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.180\nOne of the biggest issues people have,\nboth in Windows, in Linux Unix,\n\n102\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.870\nin the Mac OS, in any operating system,\nin Android, generically, right?\n\n103\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.860\nWhatever it is, is not so much hey I have\na log and I go and I look there's some\n\n104\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.390\ninformation but rather, what are those\nevent IDs or log codes telling us, right?\n\n105\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.790\nBecause we may not know and\nin many cases we don't unless we have\n\n106\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.830\nknowledge of the fact that certain\nevents are always gonna be happening,\n\n107\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.220\nwe happen to know what that event ID is.\n\n108\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.280\nBut if we don't know, we often have\nto go out and we have to Google,\n\n109\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.790\nwe have to go to the Oracle or\nto internet, right?\n\n110\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.156\nAnd we have to find out what that may be.\n\n111\n00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:12.310\nSo you wanna help me out here\nreal quick while I'm doing this?\n\n112\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.280\nCan you Google for me, cuz I have no idea\nwhat this is, I mean I can go read it but\n\n113\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.580\nI have no idea what it is.\n\n114\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.974\nCan you Google Event ID 1001 in\nMicrosoft and see what it tells us?\n\n115\n00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:23.730\nLet's see how accurate what we find is.\n\n116\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.280\nAnd I wanna prove a point\nto you about this,\n\n117\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.940\nwhich is why I'm having Daniel do this.\n\n118\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.760\nJust Google Event ID 1001, don't put\nany reference to application log or\n\n119\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.020\nWinSys log or anything like that.\n\n120\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.730\nWhat do you get?\n\n121\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.730\n&gt;&gt; I do get a TechNet article.\n\n122\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's always the top billing there on\n\n123\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.110\nGoogle And it says that it is-\n&gt;&gt; Something\n\n124\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.800\nabout Windows operating\nsystem error reporting.\n\n125\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.570\n&gt;&gt; Error reporting infrastruction for\nall reports, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n126\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.530\nFault bucket field name, fault bucket,\n\n127\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.416\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n128\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.715\nsomething to do with error reporting\nin the Windows operating system?\n\n129\n00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:56.530\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right so\n\n130\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.650\nlet's take a look, cuz we haven't\nreally drilled into this entry.\n\n131\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.450\nLet's take a look and see and my point\nwith this is going to be the following.\n\n132\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.670\nA lot of times we'll Google that Event ID,\nbut that Event ID without the context of\n\n133\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.470\nthe source may not represent the right\ninformation about the entry.\n\n134\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.230\nWe don't know in this case, we're not\nsure, but my point is Daniel may have to\n\n135\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.290\ngo out and add something like winsyslog to\nthat Google string to figure out whether\n\n136\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.250\nor not this is actually\nthe Event ID 1001 that we want.\n\n137\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.530\nOr if it's generically Event ID 1001 and\n\n138\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.840\nit may have multiple\nmeanings in the system.\n\n139\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.580\nI don't know if that changes\nwhat we get back or not.\n\n140\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.850\nHard to say for sure.\n\n141\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.970\nBut what I see here is it says, configured\nsys log server service cannot be started.\n\n142\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.080\nMost often this happens when you have a\nsys log server service configuration issue\n\n143\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.170\nwhere username and\npassword may not be accurate.\n\n144\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.735\n&gt;&gt; Looks like it might be part\nof the Windows installer,\n\n145\n00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:47.792\nan error message from Windows Installer.\n\n146\n00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:50.782\n&gt;&gt; So when you added that additional\nstring in, sys log or something like that,\n\n147\n00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:51.670\nor Windows log.\n\n148\n00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.200\nYou get some more information.\n\n149\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.680\nSo my point with this is, right,\n\n150\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.160\nas an investigator some of the simplest\nthings sometimes trip us up.\n\n151\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.120\nJust going out and\nsaying yeah I'm going to Google for\n\n152\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.750\nthat Event log ID how hard\ncould that be to figure out?\n\n153\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.020\nThere may be more than one entry for it,\nit may mean more than one thing in one log\n\n154\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.680\nbecause it may be used in multiple\nlogs but for a different context or\n\n155\n00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.950\nassociated with a different system\nservice or a different representative\n\n156\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.260\nway of understanding that information\nbecause the provider is different.\n\n157\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.020\nAnd so as a result we have to make\nsure that we're actually getting\n\n158\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.040\naccurate information to\nunderstand what that source is.\n\n159\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.330\nSo we want to keep that in\nthe back of our mind and\n\n160\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.300\nunderstand that as we\nbegin to look at logs.\n\n161\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.680\nNow in addition, right, so\nwe can see all the logs here.\n\n162\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.440\nNow we can filter these logs.\n\n163\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.290\nWe can go in,\nwe can extract a custom view.\n\n164\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.750\nWe can get detailed\ninformation out of them.\n\n165\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.260\nSo we can save all events off from here,\nright over here, Save All Events As.\n\n166\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.984\nWe could attach a task to this log.\n\n167\n00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.163\nWe could filter the log.\n\n168\n00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:53.871\nWe can do a bunch of stuff with it, right,\nand we can see information about it so\n\n169\n00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.742\nwe can interrogate that information.\n\n170\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:58.336\nAnd understand it and\npull it out forensically if we need to.\n\n171\n00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.984\nRemember, this is not volatile data.\n\n172\n00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:04.834\nNot dynamic but static data we pull off\nthe hard drive, after we do a bit copy of\n\n173\n00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:08.540\nthe drive and we're investigating\nthe drive on a separate machine.\n\n174\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.480\nSo we have our ability to\ntake our time with this.\n\n175\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.360\nWe can investigate and\npull the data out and interact with it.\n\n176\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.090\nBut we may or may not wanna use this tool.\n\n177\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.440\nWe may wanna use another tool.\n\n178\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.810\nAnd there are multiple\nways we can view this.\n\n179\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.850\nWe have another tool here.\n\n180\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.460\nThis one is called the Event Log Explorer.\n\n181\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.170\nYou can see it right up there.\n\n182\n00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.900\nAnd we can go in,\nopen up the logs on the local machine.\n\n183\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.460\nI'm gonna pull one in just a minute.\n\n184\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.150\nThe thing I like about this, it's a little\nbit [LAUGH], I don't know if you can make\n\n185\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.720\nit out on the screen, but the icon for the\nlogs is a piece of paper with an actual\n\n186\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.680\nlog [LAUGH] sign across, so\nit's an actual cut log [LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.185\nSo somebody has a sense of humor,\nwhich is kind of school.\n\n188\n00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:44.640\nSo, we can do that.\n\n189\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.110\nSo let's go in,\nwe'll just pull in the application log.\n\n190\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.620\nAll we do is double-click to load that up,\nit comes right in, and\n\n191\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.630\nyou could see the same entry\nis sitting right there, so\n\n192\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.030\nit's got the same error\nsitting right on the top.\n\n193\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.480\nWe can go in, we could see it,\n\n194\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.340\nwe could see the user,\nsee the computer information.\n\n195\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.920\nAll the same information that we\nget there but this is kind of cool.\n\n196\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.840\nSo we have all those events, we can go\nbackwards and forwards, we can drill in.\n\n197\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.440\nWe kind of see the description\njust show you here.\n\n198\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.370\nWe can just filter, let me just quickly\nzoom back in so you can see this.\n\n199\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.920\nWe can right click, we can filter, copy it\nout, we can do a bookmarking of the value.\n\n200\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.350\nBookmarks, we talked about this\nbefore in forensics FTK, right so\n\n201\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.890\nadvanced forensics FTK.\n\n202\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.793\nWe've talked about it in N.\n\n203\n00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.230\nWe've created the bookmarks for that.\n\n204\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.200\nGenerate the information for the report.\n\n205\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.210\nYou'll see we can do some color coding,\nso it makes a little bit easier for\n\n206\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.810\nus to search and find things.\n\n207\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.960\nBut generally we basically\nhave the same kind of tools,\n\n208\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.010\nsame kind of set of tools and\nthings that we can do.\n\n209\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.890\nIn the other built-in log\nadditional grade information.\n\n210\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.450\nBut we can come in here, and in addition,\n\n211\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.260\nwe can look at any data that maybe\navailable to us if this has data.\n\n212\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.990\nLet's just pick an entry that does,\nsome basic data there.\n\n213\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.670\nWe can look at the data in bite code,\nin word, in the word values.\n\n214\n00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.150\nIt's the same thing we\nwould do in the event log.\n\n215\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.890\nThere's no difference there at all.\n\n216\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.720\nThis one.\n\n217\n00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.720\nIs an entry for MSI installer,\ngot some data there,\n\n218\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.500\nthat got the information there.\n\n219\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.860\nCould we go full screen and\njust have it so you can see that?\n\n220\n00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.000\nWe've got the tracking information, right?\n\n221\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.100\nThe GUID and\nwhatever unique identifiers there.\n\n222\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.580\nFor the installed MSI\nprobably that we were using,\n\n223\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.700\nright that's what we're seeing.\n\n224\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.590\nSo we get the same exact\nkind of information here.\n\n225\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.470\nIt's not like we have a tremendous\namount of difference.\n\n226\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.280\nBut, it's a different interface.\n\n227\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.600\nAllows us to be able,\nto maybe look at this in a different way.\n\n228\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.920\nPerhaps link this to a forensics tool\nthat may be more interesting and\n\n229\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.910\ntherefore more beneficial for us to use,\nCuz we're more comfortable with it.\n\n230\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.320\nSo you may wanna look for\nan alternate log viewer.\n\n231\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.670\nThere is no right and wrong here.\n\n232\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.830\nThis will do everything\na normal log viewer does.\n\n233\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.480\nIt may just give you some\noptional bills and whistles, but\n\n234\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.120\nessentially it does allow\nus to be able to do this.\n\n235\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.870\nNow the other thing that\nI do like about this,\n\n236\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.580\nlet me just zoom in here on the file\ntab for just a second to show you this.\n\n237\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.570\nWe can merge your log file so\nwe can bring in multiple log files, and\n\n238\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.850\nmerge them from different points in time,\nare we get historical context on the log.\n\n239\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.230\nSo it just gives us a slightly\ndifferent take on what we can do here.\n\n240\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.720\nBut we save, we look at the options,\nwe can print, we can look at preferences.\n\n241\n00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.410\nAll the standard stuff, right.\n\n242\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.150\nSo we have these different log viewers.\n\n243\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:24.350\nNow, with the event viewer, let's go\nback in here for just a second, right?\n\n244\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.560\nWe are looking at, just gonna go in, and\njust gonna show you one quick thing.\n\n245\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.150\nAll I did was go up to File there,\nright in the Windows viewer.\n\n246\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.420\nJust went to Options,\nwent to Disk Cleanup.\n\n247\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.990\nNow it's important for us as investigators\nto know that somebody who's running this\n\n248\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.850\nmachine if they want to get rid of\nthe logs, may be able to go in and\n\n249\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.900\ndelete them out.\n\n250\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.950\nAnd they can go in and clear them.\n\n251\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:44.540\nAnd we know that,\n\n252\n00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.660\nwe've talked about how to recover files\non a hard drive that have been deleted.\n\n253\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.910\nRemember, deleted files are not really\ndeleted, right, we can bring them back.\n\n254\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.890\nSo we just want to know that,\nbe aware of that.\n\n255\n00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.380\nWe've talked about methodologies, and\n\n256\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.120\ntools that will let us uncover that, bring\nthat information back and restore it.\n\n257\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.070\nSo just want you know that we can\ndefinitely get rid of those log files as\n\n258\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.370\na bad actor, but of course,\nwe do have the ability.\n\n259\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.080\nAnd in theory, if we are smart about it,\n\n260\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.820\nthe ability to understand how\nto bring back those files.\n\n261\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.570\nAgain remember, not dynamic data,\nthis is static.\n\n262\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.250\nWe deleted the files, they're sitting in\nthe hard drive, in the allocation table,\n\n263\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.600\nbut we removed the pointers\nto tell us how to find them.\n\n264\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.290\nAll the programs that we use to\nrecover this kind of data do,\n\n265\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.520\nsent to read the MFT, right, the master\nfile table, or the allocation tables.\n\n266\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.580\nWe've taken a look at those,\nand in TFS, and in fact, and\n\n267\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.630\nwe simply then parcel the information\nlisted there, and we say,\n\n268\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.560\nyou want this file, we cover it,\nwe bring it back, and we show it to you.\n\n269\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.170\nSo it's not hard to do.\n\n270\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.460\nWe just have to know that if somebody\ndoes clear the logs, and we go in and\n\n271\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.620\nwe look, that that doesn't mean\nthat there's nothing there,\n\n272\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.560\nit just means that it may be a little\nbit harder for us to find it, and\n\n273\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.310\nwe just have to be up to the challenge,\nthat's really all we gotta think about and\n\n274\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.900\nunderstand, so Log files are gonna\nexist in a variety of places, right?\n\n275\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.090\nAnd we just wanna make sure we know,\n\n276\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.170\nand understand the fact that\nthose are gonna be found there.\n\n277\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.760\nNow, do we just look in the path for\nWindows Event Logs?\n\n278\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.960\nNo, there's logs in other places.\n\n279\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.030\nI mentioned if we run, web services\nlike IIS in the ww root log directory,\n\n280\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.670\nwe'd have to look there separately.\n\n281\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.600\nFTP has its own directory path for\nlogs, we mentioned that.\n\n282\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.920\nIn one fo our prior episodes.\n\n283\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.820\nIf you're running DNS,\n\n284\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.600\nyou'll have a separate set of log\nentries under the DNS server.\n\n285\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.260\nAnd for DHCP,\n\n286\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.140\nthey have their own set of log entries\nseparate from what we see in the app log.\n\n287\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.490\nIn Linux you've got log\ndirectories in various structures,\n\n288\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.140\nin the bin directory, in different areas\nyou would go in to look for logs depending\n\n289\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.270\non what it is you're looking for,\nyou'd have to know where they're located.\n\n290\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.710\nCan you find out if you're not sure?\n\n291\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.430\nYeah, absolutely, just go to Google and\nsearch for Log entries or\n\n292\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:40.900\nlog locations in FreeBSD, in\nRed Hat EL Enterprise Linux, or whatever.\n\n293\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.550\nYou'll get a listing of the standard\ndirectories you look for, and\n\n294\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.070\nthat's where you begin your investigation.\n\n295\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.160\nIt's not hard, in other words,\nright, to find this information.\n\n296\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.390\nNow having said that, today is it common\nfor us to find logs on local machines,\n\n297\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.110\nspecially if their servers\nverses perhaps seen this logs,\n\n298\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.270\nreplicated out to a same system.\n\n299\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.630\nSturdy information about management,\n\n300\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.220\nyou will think of this a syslog\nservers back in a day.\n\n301\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.880\nRight?\n\n302\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.390\nIt's very common to see logs\ncertainly in a local machines.\n\n303\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.730\nBut the reality is it's equally common\ntoday for us to have centralized\n\n304\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.680\nlog in capabilities taking place across\na network and for us to be aware of that.\n\n305\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.065\nAnd to know that as an investigator, we\nmay actually have to go to the SEM system,\n\n306\n00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:23.175\nand gather logs from there, if the logs\nhad been wiped out locally, and we may not\n\n307\n00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:26.185\nbe able to recover them, so we've done\na pretty thorough job of wiping them out.\n\n308\n00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:30.155\nBecause remember, we can actually delete\nfiles, and get rid of evidence, but\n\n309\n00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:31.105\nit's a lot tougher to do,\n\n310\n00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:34.335\nand the average person doesn't go through,\nthat amount of trouble.\n\n311\n00:14:35.378 --> 00:14:38.490\nOverriding or\ndegassing the drive in a certain way,\n\n312\n00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.260\nusing a strong electromagnetic\nfield to wipe the drive.\n\n313\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.190\nOverriding with essentially what\nwe think of as a low level format,\n\n314\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.380\nmultiple passes of ones and\nzeroes crisscrossing the drive,\n\n315\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.030\nusing certain tools will\nwipe out most remnant data.\n\n316\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.130\nI said most, not all, but\nmost remnant data, right?\n\n317\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.250\nCuz we always leave something behind.\n\n318\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.390\nEven though we may not think of that as\nbeing recoverable there's always some sort\n\n319\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.340\nof data there.\n\n320\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.480\nBut the reality is for the bad act\nthat really wants to hide their data,\n\n321\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.410\nthere may be ways for\nthem to achieve that.\n\n322\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.191\nWe've talked about\nthe termite option [LAUGH],\n\n323\n00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:06.580\nessentially you liquefy the drive.\n\n324\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.590\nIt's hard to come back from that one,\nthat's probably undiscoverable [LAUGH],\n\n325\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.020\nand an issue there where we're\njust not gonna get much data back.\n\n326\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.090\nLook there's a piece right over there\nmaybe we can stitch that together, and\n\n327\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.210\nread what's on those three\nsectors of information.\n\n328\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.810\nBut the reality is there certainly are,\nfor determined actors, ways for\n\n329\n00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.120\nthem to wipe out data.\n\n330\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.900\nSo we may have to go to\nthe secondary source, right?\n\n331\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.770\nAnd in a modern system today, using a SEM\nsystem where we're centrally aggregating,\n\n332\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.220\ncollecting, and gathering logs,\nis not uncommon.\n\n333\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.068\nAnd we want to think about the fact,\nthat as an investigator, it would be very\n\n334\n00:15:38.068 --> 00:15:41.386\nbeneficial, very important for\nus to have knowledge of the fact,\n\n335\n00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:45.021\nthat there may be more than one place for\nthese logs to be recovered from.\n\n336\n00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:49.197\nAnd we would then have to get rights,\nor permission from the system owner,\n\n337\n00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:52.067\nto go in and\nhave whoever's managing that system.\n\n338\n00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:54.332\nPull logs for us, but\nhere's the challenge.\n\n339\n00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:58.755\nIf they don't pull them forensically in\na sound way to ensure the integrity and\n\n340\n00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:00.600\nthe viability of that data.\n\n341\n00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000\nThey could be compromised, and we may\nnot be able to use them for evidence.\n\n342\n00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.250\nSo we have to work with the system owner.\n\n343\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.938\nWe have to work with the individuals,\nwhoever they are,\n\n344\n00:16:08.938 --> 00:16:10.788\nthat are managing the system.\n\n345\n00:16:10.788 --> 00:16:13.805\nAnd we may have to go in with their\npermission, with their guidance,\n\n346\n00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:15.140\nwith their support.\n\n347\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.200\nAnd show them how to\nforensically pull those logs.\n\n348\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.560\nIt may not be as simple as saying, hey\ncan you just give me a copy of those, and\n\n349\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.770\na day later you get a thumb\ndrive with all the logs on them.\n\n350\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.481\nHow do you know\nthe pedigree of those logs?\n\n351\n00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:27.700\nHow do you know where they came from?\n\n352\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.800\nHow do you know when they were gathered?\n\n353\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.093\nHow do you know how they were gathered?\n\n354\n00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:31.860\nHow do you know they\nhaven't been modified?\n\n355\n00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.533\nRight and we have tools that will let us\nwrite fake log entries into these systems,\n\n356\n00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:40.798\nwe have tools that let us modify log\nfiles after all essentially a log file is\n\n357\n00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:43.660\nnothing more than a notepad\neditable file right?\n\n358\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.262\nI mean let's take a look at that for\na second so come back over here,\n\n359\n00:16:46.262 --> 00:16:47.576\nlet me show you something right?\n\n360\n00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:51.180\nLet's go in here and\nlet me show you something, right?\n\n361\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.069\nLet's talk as my grandmother used to say.\n\n362\n00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:54.332\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's say for\n\n363\n00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:57.051\na second hypothetically,\nI come over here to the security log.\n\n364\n00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:58.800\nRight and I've have shown you this before.\n\n365\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.530\nLet's go in here, let's go to properties,\nlet's take this path statement and\n\n366\n00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.522\nI'll zoom in so\nyou could see real quick here.\n\n367\n00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:09.707\nLet's just go in, let's go to that path\nand let's take a look at that EVTX file or\n\n368\n00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:10.274\nEVT file.\n\n369\n00:17:10.274 --> 00:17:11.182\nSo we're gonna go and grab that.\n\n370\n00:17:11.182 --> 00:17:12.520\nSo let's go in there.\n\n371\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.350\nWe're gonna make sure we copy that.\n\n372\n00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.494\nI did this last time, I didn't copy it so\nlet's just grab that,\n\n373\n00:17:19.494 --> 00:17:20.887\nlet's just minimize that.\n\n374\n00:17:20.887 --> 00:17:24.140\nLet us go over here.\n\n375\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.302\nLet's go here.\n\n376\n00:17:25.302 --> 00:17:26.614\nLet us do that.\n\n377\n00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:30.690\nI'm getting smarter, I'm realizing it's\nnot the extreme left key for function.\n\n378\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.974\nWhy is function C or\nfunction B not working?\n\n379\n00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:35.640\nI'm actually getting better at that.\n\n380\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.235\nAll right so, and\nlet's use our delete slash backspace key.\n\n381\n00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:41.065\nCuz we know that that's actually\nnot really a delete key.\n\n382\n00:17:41.065 --> 00:17:44.475\nSo let's go there and let's go there and\n\n383\n00:17:44.475 --> 00:17:46.405\nnotice by the way,\nI love this about Windows.\n\n384\n00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:48.973\nIt translates %SYSTEM\nwith % as a variable.\n\n385\n00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:52.413\n[CROSSTALK] I don't have to actually write\nc in there because it's a system variable.\n\n386\n00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:57.307\nPercent whatever percent is interpreted by\nthe operating system as a system variable.\n\n387\n00:17:57.307 --> 00:18:01.337\nIt reads in this case system route and\nactually says let me go figure that out,\n\n388\n00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:05.357\ntranslates it in the environmental\nvariable file that's mapped in Windows and\n\n389\n00:18:05.357 --> 00:18:06.577\nsays that's what you want.\n\n390\n00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:09.447\nThis by the way is what malware\nattacks and remaps those variables,\n\n391\n00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:12.827\nso that way system route points you to\nsomething totally different, right?\n\n392\n00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.137\nSo we don't have to\nactually translate that.\n\n393\n00:18:14.137 --> 00:18:15.710\nWe just put that in there,\nso that's kind of cool.\n\n394\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.230\nSo we have these files in here, right?\n\n395\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.410\nSo let's come in here and\nlet's take a look.\n\n396\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.850\nSo let's just say hypothetically,\nright, we want to open this.\n\n397\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.030\nNow you'll notice when I go to open the\nhardware event log, it opens automatically\n\n398\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.730\nright in the tool because the extension is\nassociated with the application, right?\n\n399\n00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.250\nBut what we could do is the following.\n\n400\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.100\nThere's nothing in there.\n\n401\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.920\nSo let me actually go grab this one.\n\n402\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.530\nSo I could open it with\na tool like hex editor.\n\n403\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.580\nAnd I can actually go in.\n\n404\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.110\nAnd I can see and\nI can interact with the file.\n\n405\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.100\nNow, the file is in a form that I have\nto then go in and start modifying.\n\n406\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.230\nBut could I and you've already seen\nme make changes to the bids in\n\n407\n00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.440\none of our prior episodes.\n\n408\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.020\nIn the steganographic episode,\nwhere we went in and we edited\n\n409\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.730\nthe header information on an image file\nand rendered it unusable to hide it.\n\n410\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.220\nAnd then we actually edited it back,\nwith Daniel's help,\n\n411\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.795\nby change it back into a JPEG Format.\n\n412\n00:19:08.795 --> 00:19:10.915\nWe're able to bring back\nup my box of cigars, right?\n\n413\n00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:13.595\nSo could I go in and\nmake changes to this file?\n\n414\n00:19:13.595 --> 00:19:16.175\nAbsolutely, I could use a hex\neditor to be able to do this or\n\n415\n00:19:16.175 --> 00:19:19.725\nuse any kind of a tool to do this\nthat would read this information.\n\n416\n00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.537\nCould I then save that file back?\n\n417\n00:19:21.537 --> 00:19:23.597\nNow yeah there would be evidence\nto the fact that I modified it,\n\n418\n00:19:23.597 --> 00:19:27.927\nbut if I'm smart and I cover my tracks,\nI may never realize its been done, and\n\n419\n00:19:27.927 --> 00:19:30.437\nthe information there may throw\nme off as an investigator.\n\n420\n00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:32.547\nSo could I go in and monkey around?\n\n421\n00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:33.983\nCould I play around with these files?\n\n422\n00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:35.533\nYeah, I could potentially edit them.\n\n423\n00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:39.488\nSo I have to be aware of the fact that\njust because I see something in a log\n\n424\n00:19:39.488 --> 00:19:43.932\nfile doesn't necessarily mean that\nit's sound forensic evidence, right?\n\n425\n00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.433\nAnd I gotta be aware of that,\nI gotta know that.\n\n426\n00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:48.563\nAnd I gotta make sure that\nI'm thinking about that.\n\n427\n00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:52.402\nThat's why when I say, hey, make sure\nthat whoever captures those log files and\n\n428\n00:19:52.402 --> 00:19:54.603\ngives them to you,\nright, the SIM operator,\n\n429\n00:19:54.603 --> 00:19:57.730\nthat they've either gotta be\na trained forensic investigator.\n\n430\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.752\nOr you've gotta work with them and\nexplain to them what has to happen, and\n\n431\n00:20:00.752 --> 00:20:03.579\nyou've gotta come up with a way to\nvalidate the process they used, or\n\n432\n00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:06.090\nyou may not be able to present\nthat information as evidence.\n\n433\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.920\nIt may not be useable, right?\n\n434\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.430\nEven though it's incredibly important.\n\n435\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.460\nAll right, so the other thing we\nsaid we wanna take a look at is hey,\n\n436\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.920\nwhere does information come from.\n\n437\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.850\nWe know that on the local machine\nwe execute a bunch of stuff and\n\n438\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.270\nit winds up in the log files.\n\n439\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.430\nBut what about actually capturing\nstuff over the network, right?\n\n440\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.830\nSo wanna take a look at how we capture\nnetwork data and what we can do with that.\n\n441\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.340\nWe're gonna take a look at\na tool called Packetizer here,\n\n442\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.250\nthat's from a company\ncalled Network Chemistry.\n\n443\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:33.230\nIt's a great analyzer, it's free so\nit lets you do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n444\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.310\nSo let's go in, let's do a little packet\ncapture, we'll start capturing some data.\n\n445\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.490\nYou can see that there.\n\n446\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.440\nWhat I'm gonna do is go out on the\nInternet here and I'm just gonna go ahead\n\n447\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.220\nand I'm gonna do a Google search for\nsomething really quickly.\n\n448\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.420\nJust bring back up a site I'd gone to.\n\n449\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.670\nClick through a couple of things just to\nyou get some information flowing in there\n\n450\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.990\nwith regards to doing some searches.\n\n451\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:00.090\nLet's do a Google search,\nlet's search for event log IDs and\n\n452\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.200\njust do a standard search on Google and\nwe'll click through on something.\n\n453\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.230\nJust do a little description there, get\nsome information, write whatever it is,\n\n454\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.460\ndon't really care, but just wanna\ncapture a bunch of packets in there.\n\n455\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.358\nAnd so we can see the live\ndata capture coming in and\n\n456\n00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.299\nsome of the web traffic, right.\n\n457\n00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:22.272\nAnd then what we're gonna do is, yeah\nwe're up there, let's just go ahead and\n\n458\n00:21:22.272 --> 00:21:27.770\nlet's, I'm just waiting until we\nget about 44, almost 4,500 packets.\n\n459\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.318\nSo let's go ahead, and let's stop that.\n\n460\n00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:34.410\nAnd we've got about 4500\npackets approximately in there.\n\n461\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.948\nI'm just looking at the packet\ncount right there and received,\n\n462\n00:21:36.948 --> 00:21:37.891\njust to see what we got.\n\n463\n00:21:37.891 --> 00:21:40.514\nWhat we're gonna do is go over and\ntake a look at some of these packets and\n\n464\n00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:43.180\nexplain a little bit about some of\nthe things we may find in there.\n\n465\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.460\nSo a tool like this runs,\nusing a promiscuous capture mode,\n\n466\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.420\na network driver called WinPcap\nin Windows or libpcap in Linux.\n\n467\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.170\nThe WinPcap or libpcap driver\nis a promiscuous mode driver.\n\n468\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:59.908\nPromiscuous mode means that the driver is\ngoing to change the way the network card\n\n469\n00:21:59.908 --> 00:22:00.613\noperates.\n\n470\n00:22:00.613 --> 00:22:05.059\nAnd essentially allow it to see all the\ntraffic passing through the interface and\n\n471\n00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:08.784\nmake a copy of every packet instead\nof the traditional mechanism for\n\n472\n00:22:08.784 --> 00:22:13.060\noperation which is ignoring all\ntraffic that comes into the interface.\n\n473\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.350\nAnd later, too,\nin the OSI models we investigate traffic.\n\n474\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.290\nThat is not gonna have a MAC address\nassociated with our machine ID.\n\n475\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.790\nIf the MAC address that we see on\na packet normally, doesn't belong to us,\n\n476\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.020\nwe ignore the packet and pretend it\ndoesn't exist and just bypass it.\n\n477\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.550\nPromiscuous mode flips that behavior and\nsays that regardless of MAC address\n\n478\n00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.600\nin the target frame,\nin other words in the send to, right?\n\n479\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.140\nIf it's not you, don't ignore it,\ncapture it anyway.\n\n480\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.870\nAnd make a copy and that's what we see.\n\n481\n00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.051\nSo we captured 4,500 packets.\n\n482\n00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:45.459\nAnd regardless of the fact that they may\nor may not have been addressed to us,\n\n483\n00:22:45.459 --> 00:22:47.480\nwe actually are seeing that information.\n\n484\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.160\nSo we're gonna have a random\nset of packets here.\n\n485\n00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.680\nBut what we're gonna do is first of all\ntake a look at the protocol breakdown.\n\n486\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.302\nNow what we get, and\nthe reason I like a tool like this,\n\n487\n00:22:56.302 --> 00:22:59.670\nis it tells us all the different\nprotocols that we have captured.\n\n488\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.900\nGives us a percentage\nbreakdown number of bytes.\n\n489\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.317\nSo if I want to see just TCP traffic or\njust UDP or I want to see just JPEG.\n\n490\n00:23:07.317 --> 00:23:09.010\nI got some JPEG traffic there.\n\n491\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.724\nOr i want to see some\nspanning tree protocol,\n\n492\n00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:15.571\na very small amount but I got some.\n\n493\n00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:17.660\nI want to see IPv6 traffic.\n\n494\n00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.600\nI can zero in, click on that,\nand see just those frames.\n\n495\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.540\nI don't have to go through 4500 packets.\n\n496\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.450\nI can filter.\n\n497\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.260\nNow filtering is not an unusual concept.\n\n498\n00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.400\nWe have it in every tool.\n\n499\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.222\nBut the graphical way this does it for\nus and\n\n500\n00:23:28.222 --> 00:23:30.354\nthe ability to do it right\nfrom here is kinda nice.\n\n501\n00:23:30.354 --> 00:23:34.140\nIt makes it very easy for\nthe investigator to be able to work with.\n\n502\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.670\nSo we can see all that.\n\n503\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.290\nWe also can see all the connections.\n\n504\n00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.570\nAnd let's just open up one or\ntwo of these here so\n\n505\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.760\nwe can see what we're getting,\nand just to give you a sense.\n\n506\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.929\nAnd what we get is we can\nsee the connections to and\n\n507\n00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:56.033\nfrom what machine was sending,\nand obviously receiving.\n\n508\n00:23:56.033 --> 00:23:59.651\nAnd we can see all the protocol traffic,\nand the actual ports that are going back\n\n509\n00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:02.440\nand forth, and\nthe percentage of traffic here as well.\n\n510\n00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.450\nAgain, this is just off the top without\nhaving to drill in, modify any views,\n\n511\n00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.360\ndo any filtering.\n\n512\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.290\nThat's why I like this tool,\n\n513\n00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.580\nit gives us all these capabilities\nright out of the box, and it's free.\n\n514\n00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.510\nYou don't have to pay anything for\nthis tool ever, you just use it.\n\n515\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.300\nThis is one of the reasons\nI like this tool.\n\n516\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.490\nSo, we get all this connection breakdown\ninformation, we see the protocols.\n\n517\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.890\nAnd we can then go in,\nthis is all DNS traffic, for instance.\n\n518\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.290\nAnd we can take a look here and\n\n519\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.180\nwe can see, we could show packets,\nwe could analyze the flow.\n\n520\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.580\nAgain, this is all built\nright in the tool.\n\n521\n00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.820\nI don't have to do anything special.\n\n522\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.260\nAll I have to do is right click,\nand I can take a look at this, so\n\n523\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.420\nI can subdivide this traffic,\ngo in and pull it out immediately,\n\n524\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.520\nand then I can get a report on,\nright from within the interface, and\n\n525\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.040\nI can say it's okay,\nhere's all the traffic that went from this\n\n526\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.570\nmachine to that machine, using this\nprotocol during this time period.\n\n527\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.962\nSo, it's very, very easy for\nme to drill in using a tool like this.\n\n528\n00:24:50.962 --> 00:24:54.020\nAnd again, this is not the only\ntool that does this, right?\n\n529\n00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.270\nBut this is a tool I like to use, because\nit's intuitive, it's easy, and it's free.\n\n530\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.440\nFree, free.\n\n531\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.110\nWe like that.\n\n532\n00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.030\n&gt;&gt; I love free 99.\n\n533\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.360\n&gt;&gt; Free's are cool, right?\n\n534\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.270\nSo, we have statistics.\n\n535\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.740\nNow, if we're doing,\nwe're not doing wireless in this demo, but\n\n536\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.730\nif we were, we have an entire set of\ncaptures that would allow us to see\n\n537\n00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.540\nthe wireless traffic here, so\nwe could use this to see wireless as well.\n\n538\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.690\nAnd we could build our own capture filters\nand load them up ahead of time, or\n\n539\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.510\njust build them on the fly if we want to.\n\n540\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.140\nAll right, so\nnow that we've kinda just done that and\n\n541\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.350\ntaken a look at that,\nlet's just go in randomly.\n\n542\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.120\nLet's just pull a packet out.\n\n543\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.680\nYou got a field in front of it today,\na little UDP, a little TCP, what?\n\n544\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.280\nA little HKey now.\n\n545\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What are we thinking about?\n\n546\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go web, right?\n\n547\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.900\nThat's always fun.\n\n548\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.640\n&gt;&gt; Go web, all right.\n\n549\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.000\nSo, let's do that.\n\n550\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.680\nSo, let's go down towards\nthe bottom there.\n\n551\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.940\nAnd I got a little TLS going on,\na little DNS.\n\n552\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.950\nGot some tcp https.\n\n553\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.790\nAll right, so, let's go,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n554\n00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.745\nSo, Daniel said web, so what I did here,\nright highlighted this packet,\n\n555\n00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:54.060\nyou can see tsp https,\nsequence number, right?\n\n556\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.045\nIt's got some information in there.\n\n557\n00:25:56.045 --> 00:25:57.555\nSo, we get three panes here.\n\n558\n00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:01.415\nWe've got the pack and capture, we've got\nthe actual raw data down on the bottom.\n\n559\n00:26:01.415 --> 00:26:04.435\nAnd then over here, we actually can\nbreakdown and look at the pack,\n\n560\n00:26:04.435 --> 00:26:05.625\nit headers and the code.\n\n561\n00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:07.135\nWe're gonna actually take\na look at what's in there.\n\n562\n00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:08.465\nSo, we're gonna open this up.\n\n563\n00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:12.415\nWe'll go one section at a time.\n\n564\n00:26:12.415 --> 00:26:16.380\nLet me just open this up,\nand we'll drill down here.\n\n565\n00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.850\nSo starting here, show you a little\nbit how to read a packet, and\n\n566\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.600\nwhat's going on there.\n\n567\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.310\nCan we go full screen?\n\n568\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.800\nThis is gonna require\nus to see everything.\n\n569\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.870\nThank you, that's much better.\n\n570\n00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.827\nSo we can see here the frame information.\n\n571\n00:26:25.827 --> 00:26:27.106\nThis is frame 3879.\n\n572\n00:26:27.106 --> 00:26:31.540\nIt's got 66 bytes of data contained\nwithin it, important to know that.\n\n573\n00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.156\nWe get time stamping, so Arrival Time,\ndelta from previous packet,\n\n574\n00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:37.009\nTime since refresh in first frame.\n\n575\n00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:40.753\nSo, we can see the elapsed amount of time\nin the capture where this package sits in\n\n576\n00:26:40.753 --> 00:26:43.467\nthe sequence and\nthe session related to everything else.\n\n577\n00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:47.355\nWe see the tracking number,\nthe frame number, packet length,\n\n578\n00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:49.300\ncapture length and protocols.\n\n579\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.987\nAnother reason I love this scanner,\nprotocols in the frame, so\n\n580\n00:26:51.987 --> 00:26:53.499\nit tell us all the protocols we see.\n\n581\n00:26:53.499 --> 00:26:57.114\nWe've got ethernet,\nwe've got IP, we've got TCP.\n\n582\n00:26:57.114 --> 00:26:59.740\nSo, we're gonna see three\ndifferent protocols here.\n\n583\n00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.125\nPeople often forget that\nethernet is a protocol.\n\n584\n00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:03.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't think about that and\n\n585\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.610\nrealize that, right?\n\n586\n00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.415\nSo we have ethernet, and\nit breaks down each protocol for us.\n\n587\n00:27:07.415 --> 00:27:10.275\nWe'll take a look quickly at each one,\nethernet, IP, and\n\n588\n00:27:10.275 --> 00:27:12.335\nthen TCP, we see everything there.\n\n589\n00:27:12.335 --> 00:27:16.395\nSo we see the ethernet portion of our\nprogram right up top there, got our MAC\n\n590\n00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:20.645\naddress as source, SRC as source,\nDST destination, two in front, right?\n\n591\n00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:23.475\nSo we got that,\nwe're gonna see that information there,\n\n592\n00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.625\nwe're gonna be able to take a look.\n\n593\n00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:28.185\nNow, when I drill in here,\nI'm just gonna open this up so\n\n594\n00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:30.930\nwe can see what the information is.\n\n595\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.930\nWhoops, we can see destination and\nsources, I open that up.\n\n596\n00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.780\nWe'll see the MAC addresses there.\n\n597\n00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.110\nWe'll see if this is a multicast or\nunicast frame.\n\n598\n00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.280\nSo, we've got the indicator there,\nit's a unicast frame.\n\n599\n00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.060\nAnd it looks like locally\nadministered address.\n\n600\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.520\nThis is a factory default address,\n\n601\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.840\nmeaning, the MAC address it tells us,\nhas not been modified.\n\n602\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.550\nThis is the default\naddress put on the system.\n\n603\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:59.010\nWe do have tools, by the way,\nthat would allow us to actually modify and\n\n604\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.690\nto change MAC addresses.\n\n605\n00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.730\nWe talk about them in our\nhacking discussion, so\n\n606\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.155\nin CEH for instance, we talk about it,\nanother tool called smack,\n\n607\n00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:10.725\nwhich would allow us to actually go in and\nmodify MAC addresses.\n\n608\n00:28:10.725 --> 00:28:13.275\nSo, we may see modification,\nwould be good for\n\n609\n00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:17.255\nus to know MAC addresses have been\nmodified, tells us that a bad actor\n\n610\n00:28:17.255 --> 00:28:21.385\nmay up to spoofing, or masquerading, and\nis pretending to be somebody they're not.\n\n611\n00:28:21.385 --> 00:28:24.855\nAnd as surprising as it is, it's not\nvery hard to modify Mac addresses.\n\n612\n00:28:24.855 --> 00:28:29.505\nThere was a time when you would\nactually get the network card, or\n\n613\n00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:30.795\nwhatever you are gonna use for\n\n614\n00:28:30.795 --> 00:28:34.510\nyour network interface, if you were buying\na physical card, you still do this today.\n\n615\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.740\nBut when you buy them,\nyou used to get driver disks.\n\n616\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.150\nRemember good old fashioned floppy disks?\n\n617\n00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.320\nRight, you get driver disks with the card.\n\n618\n00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.170\nAnd when you got them,\n\n619\n00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.020\none of the tools that the vendor\nwould often give you on the disk set\n\n620\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.460\nwould be a tool that would let you modify\nthe MAC addresses, one of the utilities.\n\n621\n00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.070\nThen they got smart and realized they hey,\nthat's not such a good idea.\n\n622\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.970\nCuz people are gonna get up to no good.\n\n623\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.159\nThey stopped giving out the utilities.\n\n624\n00:28:53.159 --> 00:28:56.163\nBut then we have tools to let us do that,\nlike smacking on other tools so,\n\n625\n00:28:56.163 --> 00:28:56.667\nwe can use.\n\n626\n00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:59.808\nSo, we obviously want to look and\nsee whether or not we bona-fide that, and\n\n627\n00:28:59.808 --> 00:29:02.180\nthen this tool will tell us\nwhether it has been modified.\n\n628\n00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.430\nSo, we can see that.\n\n629\n00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.160\nLet's go back in here.\n\n630\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.998\nLet's just zoom out.\n\n631\n00:29:05.998 --> 00:29:10.080\nLet me just clean up the Ethernet here\nreally quick, give us a little room.\n\n632\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.020\nClean up the frame information,\n\n633\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:18.250\nlet's focus in on the IP portion\nof our program right down there.\n\n634\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.000\nAnd so now, we see source and destination\nIP address instead of MAC address,\n\n635\n00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.070\nup one layer, right?\n\n636\n00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.100\nMoving up in the OSI model,\nand so we're going to CIP.\n\n637\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.910\nIt's version four.\n\n638\n00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.460\nWe may have version six, and we could\ncertainly take a look at the differences.\n\n639\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.750\nWe see differentiated service fields,\nwe'll open that up.\n\n640\n00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:39.410\nWe see the length of the packet at this\npoint, so it was 66 overall, or 64,\n\n641\n00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.920\nor whatever it was, but\n\n642\n00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.760\na certain number of those bytes are\ndedicated to other stuff in the packet.\n\n643\n00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.440\nSo, we're able to drill down and see how\nmuch of the packet data is related to\n\n644\n00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.410\neach individual exchange\nof information by protocol.\n\n645\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.740\nWhich is nice,\nwe got our unique identifier.\n\n646\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.910\nWe have our TCP, or\nin this case, IP flags.\n\n647\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.280\nIP has flags like TCP does.\n\n648\n00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.170\nThese are specific two fragmentation.\n\n649\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.992\nAnd so,\nwe see the don't fragment flag is set.\n\n650\n00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:05.265\nWe have our TTL value that's is there.\n\n651\n00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:08.394\nWe have our protocol,\nwe can see down below, we using TCP,\n\n652\n00:30:08.394 --> 00:30:09.967\nwe have our header checksum.\n\n653\n00:30:09.967 --> 00:30:14.131\nNow notice, by the way, interesting,\nsince header checksum's all zeroes, but\n\n654\n00:30:14.131 --> 00:30:15.155\nit says incorrect.\n\n655\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.020\nSo, it looks like there's something\nwrong with the checksum and\n\n656\n00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.850\nthe integrity check on this packet.\n\n657\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.120\nNow, that may or\nmay not be important for us to note.\n\n658\n00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.100\nWe'd have to do a little\ndigging here to find out.\n\n659\n00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.070\nBut it does flag the fact that there\nseems to be an issue with the checksum.\n\n660\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.770\nSo again, and I like this tool\nbecause it tells us all this, and\n\n661\n00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.970\nit gives us source and\ndestination information.\n\n662\n00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.340\nLet's take a look and actually drill in\nat a couple of the things that are just\n\n663\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.000\nkind of closed with our plus signs.\n\n664\n00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.220\nLet me just scroll down a little bit,\nopen that back up, just zoom in, so\n\n665\n00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.570\nwe can see those fields.\n\n666\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.666\nAll right so, differentiated,\nas you can see there, service.\n\n667\n00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:51.341\nField, right?\n\n668\n00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:58.590\nWe see the differentiated service code\npoint, we see the transport information.\n\n669\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.660\nThis is detailed stuff on the networking\nside in terms of how we setup and\n\n670\n00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.250\nstructure, the information of the packet\nprobably not really important to us as\n\n671\n00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.500\nan investigator, per say, right now,\nbut something we may wanna know.\n\n672\n00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.800\nWhat we do wanna know, and\n\n673\n00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.020\nmore importantly look at,\nis the flag offset for fragmentation.\n\n674\n00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.480\nIs this a fragmented packet,\n\n675\n00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.730\nmeaning is it one of several packets\nthat are sequenced in order?\n\n676\n00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.500\nBecause I would have to go and capture.\n\n677\n00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.630\nAnd we do have them, but\nI'd have to go look at them.\n\n678\n00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.950\nAll the other packets to\nmake up this transmission.\n\n679\n00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.040\nBecause if the packet or\ndata is fragmented,\n\n680\n00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.330\nand we want a complete record of the\ntransmission, I'd have to know that and\n\n681\n00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.280\ncapture 30, 40 packets, however many\npackets were in the fragmentation series.\n\n682\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.810\nAnd I would get indications of that\nby looking at the fragment flag.\n\n683\n00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.362\nNow, this one says don't fragment,\nthe value is set to zero, meaning this\n\n684\n00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:47.323\nindividual packet stands alone, and does\nnot have any packets associated with it.\n\n685\n00:31:47.323 --> 00:31:51.353\nIt's not the case, and again, as an\ninvestigator, we would have to know that.\n\n686\n00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:53.281\nAnd then the header checks some, right?\n\n687\n00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:55.372\nTells us that it looks like\nthere's something there.\n\n688\n00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:58.659\nIt's just a binary\ntrue/false good/bad check.\n\n689\n00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:01.609\nIt doesn't say hey,\nit's bad and here's why.\n\n690\n00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:06.217\nIt just says hey, we checked it, it should\nbe whatever that value is, but it's not,\n\n691\n00:32:06.217 --> 00:32:07.250\nit's all zeroes.\n\n692\n00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.550\nThat means we may not have sent\nthe data to represent the check.\n\n693\n00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.165\nSo, I might actually bother\nwith it in this packet or\n\n694\n00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:14.705\nit could be that someone\nwas messing around with it.\n\n695\n00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:15.395\nWe don't know.\n\n696\n00:32:15.395 --> 00:32:17.015\nThere's no way to tell right now, but\n\n697\n00:32:17.015 --> 00:32:20.105\nit's an indication of something we want\nto follow up on as an investigator.\n\n698\n00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.475\nSo, we've got all that.\n\n699\n00:32:21.475 --> 00:32:24.265\nLet's clean this up and just get rid\nof this and we're going to go in and\n\n700\n00:32:24.265 --> 00:32:27.165\ntake a look at TCP, so\nlet's just scroll in.\n\n701\n00:32:27.165 --> 00:32:29.925\nWhat I'm going to do is,\njust open this up real quick one time.\n\n702\n00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:32.939\nSo when I zoom in, we have everything\ninstead of having to do it twice.\n\n703\n00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:38.450\nSo, now we have TCP and you can see\nthere we're doing source port and\n\n704\n00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.740\ndestination port.\n\n705\n00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.650\nSo, we're actually seeing\nthe port numbers now, right.\n\n706\n00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.200\nFor TCP, which is important,\n\n707\n00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.060\nbecause we've already got the IP addresses\nin the layer right up above there with IP.\n\n708\n00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.160\nAnd we've got the MAC\naddresses with ethernet,\n\n709\n00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.310\nso we've gotten all the different\ndifferentiators all the way down.\n\n710\n00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.350\nSo, now we've got our ports and\nwe've got our destination port.\n\n711\n00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.450\nIt's going to port 443 so it's HTML.\n\n712\n00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.700\nYes, it's coming from source port 52651.\n\n713\n00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.230\nRandom dynamic port,\nsomewhere up in that range, right.\n\n714\n00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.680\nSo, we just want to be aware of that and\nthen, we have our sequence number, zero.\n\n715\n00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.200\nSo, we know it's not\ngoing to be fragmented.\n\n716\n00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.310\nWe have our header length.\n\n717\n00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.020\nWe have our flags and the flags\nare important to us in the packet.\n\n718\n00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.550\nBecause the flags help us\nto understand whether or\n\n719\n00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:22.730\nnot or what kind of traffic this is and\nwhat kind of packet this may be.\n\n720\n00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.190\nIs it a reset package?\n\n721\n00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.950\nIs it urgent or batch agent?\n\n722\n00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.100\nIs it a push?\n\n723\n00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.570\nIs it a sin, a fin?\n\n724\n00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.385\nOr is it a synchronize, a finisher,\n\n725\n00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:35.086\na finalize an act using\nthe TCP three-way handshake?\n\n726\n00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:36.831\nSo a lot of stuff we want to know.\n\n727\n00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:39.140\nThis looks like it is the same packet,\nright.\n\n728\n00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.000\nSo it is a synchronize packet.\n\n729\n00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.690\nIt looks like it is part of\nthe maybe three-way handshake, so\n\n730\n00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.660\nit's something that we\nwould have to look at.\n\n731\n00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.990\nIt gives us the Window size.\n\n732\n00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.410\nGives us the check sum.\n\n733\n00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.380\nAgain, the check sum looks like it's\nincorrect, which we would expect.\n\n734\n00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:57.270\nBecause the other check sum up above\nright, in the IP area was incorrect.\n\n735\n00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.290\nWe would want to assume that both\ncheck sums would be incorrect, or\n\n736\n00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.350\nthey should both be correct.\n\n737\n00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.540\nSo we would expect to see that and we've\ngot some additional options here, right.\n\n738\n00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.710\nWhatever they may be and so by looking\ndown into this individual packet,\n\n739\n00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.400\nwe don't really see any data per se.\n\n740\n00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.990\nThat's not really what this particular\ninvestigation technique will be about for\n\n741\n00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.540\none packet.\n\n742\n00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.560\nBut what we do see is, some very valuable\ninformation that helps us to understand\n\n743\n00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.940\nwhat kind of data we're looking at.\n\n744\n00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.410\nNow, you said you wanted to\nlook at some web traffic.\n\n745\n00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:26.519\nLet's for a minute,\ninstead of looking at web traffic.\n\n746\n00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.780\nLet's just take a look at another kind\nof traffic here, so let's go in and and\n\n747\n00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.440\nlet me do the following.\n\n748\n00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.270\nLet's take a look at\nthis packet right here.\n\n749\n00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.250\nOne that has data and\n\n750\n00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.430\nI just want to show something other than-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n751\n00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.710\n&gt;&gt; other than the set of traffic, right?\n\n752\n00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.760\nI want to actually see some data,\nbrcause data is cool.\n\n753\n00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.240\nThat's what we want to see, right?\n\n754\n00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.950\nAnd so we're looking at this packet.\n\n755\n00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.730\nThis packet's over here further down\nthe stack, almost at the bottom.\n\n756\n00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:59.600\nIt is a TCP packet, right, but it actually\nhas got some data associated with it.\n\n757\n00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.710\nAnd when we look at that,\n\n758\n00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.850\nwe can see that there's actually\n213 bytes of data sitting in there.\n\n759\n00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.495\n&gt;&gt; Now we don't know what that is, but-\n\n760\n00:35:05.495 --> 00:35:06.220\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] My shell code\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n761\n00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.010\n&gt;&gt; My shell code.\n\n762\n00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.696\n&gt;&gt; Your shell code?\n\n763\n00:35:07.696 --> 00:35:09.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome, love that.\n\n764\n00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.850\nAll right, so let's see what that is.\n\n765\n00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Open that up.\n\n766\n00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.580\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH] yeah,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n767\n00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.470\nSo when we scroll in, we see the data.\n\n768\n00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.120\nNow notice, we're not getting the data\npopping down the way we did all\n\n769\n00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:18.730\nthe other stuff.\n\n770\n00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.540\nWhat we're getting instead is,\nwhen we highlight it.\n\n771\n00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.030\nWe see that the data's actually displayed\nin the raw capture field on the right.\n\n772\n00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.830\nWe're highlighting it,\nso that's all the data.\n\n773\n00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.845\nThat block is the actual data.\n\n774\n00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:31.415\nThe stuff in the front of it,\non the left is, the header, right.\n\n775\n00:35:31.415 --> 00:35:34.875\nSo everything else is the data, so\nnow we can verify there's data here.\n\n776\n00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:37.745\nAnd we could actually go in and\nwe would be able to either run that\n\n777\n00:35:37.745 --> 00:35:40.055\nthrough some sort of program\nthat may decide for it first.\n\n778\n00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:42.315\nWe may be able to read it or\nit may be human readable.\n\n779\n00:35:42.315 --> 00:35:43.185\nI'm looking.\n\n780\n00:35:43.185 --> 00:35:45.655\nIt doesn't look like there's much\nin there that's human-readable.\n\n781\n00:35:45.655 --> 00:35:48.825\nBut it would be able to be deciphered\nby some of the programs, so\n\n782\n00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:50.390\nwe could use to interpret data.\n\n783\n00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.750\nAnd so, one of the things we look for\nwhen we do a packet capture is,\n\n784\n00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.810\npackets that actually have\ndata associated with them.\n\n785\n00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.250\nNot just set up packets.\n\n786\n00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.130\nStructure, management, like we just\nlooked at, but packets with actual data.\n\n787\n00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.515\nNow, if we were looking to capture hashes,\n\n788\n00:36:04.515 --> 00:36:07.405\nas we'd talked about let's say in\nour Password Cracking Episode.\n\n789\n00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:08.875\nOr maybe passwords in the clear.\n\n790\n00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:12.551\nBecause somebody sent them without\nobfuscating them in some way.\n\n791\n00:36:12.551 --> 00:36:14.645\n&gt;&gt; Telnet [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We would look right exactly, right.\n\n792\n00:36:14.645 --> 00:36:16.738\nWe would look for\ndata packets like this one.\n\n793\n00:36:16.738 --> 00:36:19.978\nBut we would actually see live data\nsitting there in an un-encrypted or\n\n794\n00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:21.062\nperhaps exposed form.\n\n795\n00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:22.737\nAnd we would start to pull that stuff out.\n\n796\n00:36:22.737 --> 00:36:24.779\nThis is how we actually capture hashes.\n\n797\n00:36:24.779 --> 00:36:26.894\nThis is how we actually capture passwords.\n\n798\n00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:30.211\nBy looking for the packets that have\ndata in them and then by doing that,\n\n799\n00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:32.776\nwe can then actually interact\nwith that information.\n\n800\n00:36:32.776 --> 00:36:33.943\nPut it in and examine it.\n\n801\n00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:36.133\nThis is what an investigator would do and\n\n802\n00:36:36.133 --> 00:36:38.573\nthis is how we would\nforensically examine data.\n\n803\n00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:41.143\nRemember capturing this data,\nthis is dynamic data,\n\n804\n00:36:41.143 --> 00:36:43.336\nthis is live work in real time.\n\n805\n00:36:43.336 --> 00:36:47.216\nThis is something we're capturing\nby essentially masquerading or\n\n806\n00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:51.116\nsnooping or sniffing passively or\nactively on network.\n\n807\n00:36:51.116 --> 00:36:52.596\nPretending to be somebody or\n\n808\n00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:56.976\nsurreptitiously just monitoring what's\ngoing on, so this is perishable data.\n\n809\n00:36:56.976 --> 00:36:59.956\nThe minute we capture it to our\nsystem we have a record of it.\n\n810\n00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:01.946\nI can save this file, right?\n\n811\n00:37:01.946 --> 00:37:03.630\nI can take this data.\n\n812\n00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.950\nI can come up here.\n\n813\n00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.000\nYou see, I've got my standard\nuniversal floppy sign.\n\n814\n00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.390\nWhat are we going to do when\nwe get rid of the floppy disk?\n\n815\n00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.820\nHow are we going to\nrecognize things are saved?\n\n816\n00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.560\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; We've\ngot to come up with a whole new logo.\n\n817\n00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.240\nThat's probably literally the reason why\nwe have not gotten rid of floppy drives.\n\n818\n00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Younger people probably just\nthink that's the Save icon.\n\n819\n00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they don't even know\nthat that's a floppy disk, right?\n\n820\n00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.860\nThey don't realize what that is.\n\n821\n00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.520\nYeah, that square thing that we go to,\nright?\n\n822\n00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.470\nThat's what that is.\n\n823\n00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.750\nRight, but it's actually a floppy disk.\n\n824\n00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.898\n&gt;&gt; Is it a robot head?\n\n825\n00:37:26.898 --> 00:37:28.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n826\n00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.440\n&gt;&gt; So we could go save this, right.\n\n827\n00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.630\nLet me just show you what this\nlooks like if we save it.\n\n828\n00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.120\nAnd by the way, let me zoom in so\nyou can see this.\n\n829\n00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.740\nThe capture session right there.\n\n830\n00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.370\nNotice that it is being\nsaved as a .cap file, and\n\n831\n00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.870\nnotice what it says down there right\nSave as type libdcap.tc.b3, et cetera.\n\n832\n00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.040\nThis file and this tool can be\nread by any of those other tools.\n\n833\n00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.650\nWe could use tc dump or a tcp dump.\n\n834\n00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.180\nWe can use Etherreal,\nnow called Watershore, right?\n\n835\n00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you know,\n\n836\n00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.460\nwe can use any of those tools\nthat read standard cap files.\n\n837\n00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.330\nWe could load this information in,\nforensically examining it in another tool.\n\n838\n00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.540\nCommand line, your favorite thing?\n\n839\n00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.420\nYou want to do that, no problem.\n\n840\n00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.830\nTcpdump, awesome tool, use that.\n\n841\n00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.480\nYou prefer wireshark/ethereal, do that.\n\n842\n00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.630\nNetter cap from Linux fudex,\nlet's use that.\n\n843\n00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.308\nAll of them use the dot cap extension,\nso does this tool.\n\n844\n00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:17.240\nSo just because we use one tool,\ndoesn't mean we can't pork the data around\n\n845\n00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.050\n&gt;&gt; It's a standard.\n\n846\n00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.850\n&gt;&gt; It's a standard.\n\n847\n00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:23.540\nWhat we have to do is, if we're capturing\nthis data on a forensic workstation.\n\n848\n00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.250\nNot from the actual machine\nthat it's going and coming to.\n\n849\n00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.410\nWe have to keep in mind that certain parts\nof this data will not be usable, but\n\n850\n00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:30.540\ncertain parts may be.\n\n851\n00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.580\nIf we're capturing it on the machine\nthat we think has been compromised.\n\n852\n00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.390\nAnd we're trying to capture this\nin real time from that machine.\n\n853\n00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.520\nWe're doing it there.\n\n854\n00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.810\nWe would want to capture this data.\n\n855\n00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.160\nThen save it off to an external device, so\n\n856\n00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.990\nthat we have a record of it that's\nnot going to be compromised.\n\n857\n00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.910\nSo, we'd have to think about\nthe methodology and the focal point, and\n\n858\n00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.250\nthe thought process here.\n\n859\n00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.840\nBut I just wanted to show you,\n\n860\n00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.280\nuses a standard file extension that\ncan be read by any other machine.\n\n861\n00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.780\nSo, it's important for us to realize\nthat and understand that as well.\n\n862\n00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.210\nAnd obviously if we do save this,\nwe'll just save it so we have it then.\n\n863\n00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:07.210\nPut that on the desktop and then, our\ncapture file is just sitting right there.\n\n864\n00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.870\nWe can load that up if we need to.\n\n865\n00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.440\nFloating, isolated and\nserene in a pretty sea of blue.\n\n866\n00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.365\nVery very peaceful, he's at rest.\n\n867\n00:39:14.365 --> 00:39:15.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n868\n00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.070\nthat's just some basic information about\nwhat we're going to do to obviously,\n\n869\n00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:19.920\nlook at log files.\n\n870\n00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.372\nDo some capturing,\ncapture that data, bring it up.\n\n871\n00:39:22.372 --> 00:39:23.950\nRob's used it on another system.\n\n872\n00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:24.980\nInterrogate the system.\n\n873\n00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.450\nFind out what's been going on there.\n\n874\n00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.340\nThese are some of the techniques,\nthe mechanisms,\n\n875\n00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.560\nthe methods that aninvestigator\nmay use to examine event logs.\n\n876\n00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.330\nAnd obviously in real time to\ndo some network capturing, and\n\n877\n00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.250\ninvestigate that data.\n\n878\n00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.290\nAnd see a little bit more about\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n879\n00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.400\nHopefully, some good stuff for you.\n\n880\n00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.650\n&gt;&gt; As an investigator, we are looking for\nthe fingerprints, as they were and\n\n881\n00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.530\nsometimes you'll find those in the logs.\n\n882\n00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.590\nSometimes you'll find them live in\nthe network traffic themselves,\n\n883\n00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.760\nbecause bad actor had to\nmake a connection somehow.\n\n884\n00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.700\nHe had to and\nthere's going to be some telltale signs.\n\n885\n00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.670\nBeing able to use the tools available\nthat are ready to find those fingerprints\n\n886\n00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.450\nis going to help you go a long\nway in your CHFI career.\n\n887\n00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.700\nAdam, thank you for\nshowing us these tools.\n\n888\n00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.685\nHow to use them, the concepts behind them,\nwhat we should be thinking of as CHFIs, so\n\n889\n00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:11.690\nthat we can do that job very well.\n\n890\n00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.910\nThat being said,\nit is time to for us to sign off.\n\n891\n00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.790\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n892\n00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.070\nWe hope you've enjoyed it, but\n\n893\n00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.560\nfor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n894\n00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.450\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:45.700\nI gotta be careful not to\ntrip over myself here.\n\n25\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.540\nSo I am doing well.\n\n26\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.960\nHopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n27\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.880\nSo we're gonna continue, talk a little bit\nabout log capturing, network forensics.\n\n28\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.650\nOur famous part two which comes after\npart one and before part three, but\n\n29\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.810\nonly if you're not putting together\npart four on a Tuesday from IKEA.\n\n30\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.340\nOtherwise it is part five.\n\n31\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.160\nBut see the section six to tell you\nabout part two in version three.\n\n32\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.050\nSo we're gonna make sure\nall that works for you.\n\n33\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.020\n&gt;&gt; Hope you followed that.\n\n34\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.520\n&gt;&gt; And hopefully you kept up with that.\n\n35\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.480\nIf not, rewind, and start again.\n\n36\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.820\nBut watch it backwards,\nthat way you know what we're doing.\n\n37\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.370\nSo we're gonna continue our conversation.\n\n38\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.690\nWe did a little show and\ntell, a little demo for\n\n39\n00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.690\nyou about some of the intricacies and\nimportant things we want to be aware of\n\n40\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.610\nin regards to logs and capturing of\ninformation and network forensics.\n\n41\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.201\nWanna pick up on those themes, talk a bit\nmore about some of the underlying tones\n\n42\n00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:36.991\nand interesting items there.\n\n43\n00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.990\nSome mutterings, if you will,\nor murmurings, or mumblings or\n\n44\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.245\nwhatever it is you said and\naccused me of doing.\n\n45\n00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:43.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As we got started.\n\n46\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.000\nWe're gonna talk about some of that.\n\n47\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.800\nWe're also gonna go back and\ntake a look at some things.\n\n48\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.880\nI actually have some of those\nprograms we mentioned, like IIS,\n\n49\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.986\nlike DHCP, like DNS installed.\n\n50\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.490\nWe'll take a look at where\nthose logs may wind up,\n\n51\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.630\njust to make sure you know how to\nfind them when you're investigating.\n\n52\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.970\nAlways important to know where\nto search and what to look for.\n\n53\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.490\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n54\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.050\nWe're also gonna go back and\n\n55\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.620\ntalk about some of the common\nevent id codes that may show up.\n\n56\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.480\nWe mentioned hey, go out and Google those.\n\n57\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.130\nTalked about the importance of\nhaving the context around them.\n\n58\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.120\nBut there's a list of some\ncommon security event IDs.\n\n59\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.761\nWe'll put a complete list for\nyou in the show notes,\n\n60\n00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.230\nyou'll be able to reference those.\n\n61\n00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.850\nWe gave you this list about fives or\n\n62\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.920\nten of them something like that,\nand we'll take a look at that.\n\n63\n00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.338\nAnd we also ,we'll go ahead and show\nyou the value of NTP,and why NTP is so,\n\n64\n00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:33.840\nso important to the forensic investigator.\n\n65\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.880\nThat is, network time protocol as opposed\nto anything else you may think of.\n\n66\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.310\nDo you know what port in\nprotocol NTP runs on?\n\n67\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.555\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, you'd ask me NTP.\n\n68\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Think Dr. Seuss.\n\n69\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.631\nThink NTP is on port.\n\n70\n00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:50.607\n&gt;&gt; 103.\n\n71\n00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:51.902\n&gt;&gt; Close.\n\n72\n00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:53.044\n&gt;&gt; Go up by 20.\n\n73\n00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:54.179\n&gt;&gt; 123.\n\n74\n00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.204\n&gt;&gt; See, he is just phenomenal,\nthis man is.\n\n75\n00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:58.067\n&gt;&gt; I knew it was in the hundreds.\n\n76\n00:02:58.067 --> 00:02:59.849\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's only 999 options there.\n\n77\n00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.517\nYou would have gotten it eventually.\n\n78\n00:03:01.517 --> 00:03:05.740\nSo yes, NTP runs on port 123 and\nwe'll be talking about that a little bit.\n\n79\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.840\nWhy it's so important for\nus to think about time synchronization.\n\n80\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.680\nWe've talked about the value of time, and\n\n81\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.120\nUTC, Universal Time, and\nmaking sure we know about that.\n\n82\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.700\nGotta know that certain logs are done\nin UTC and translated locally.\n\n83\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.230\nWe're gonna wanna make sure we're\njust playing by those rules and\n\n84\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.030\nthinking about it.\n\n85\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.648\nWe also wanna talk a bit about Linux.\n\n86\n00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:25.282\nWe haven't mentioned Linux very\nmuch in many of our shows.\n\n87\n00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:28.707\nWe sprinkle it in every so often here and\nthere because it is important for\n\n88\n00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.009\nus as forensic investigators\nto be aware of it and\n\n89\n00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.016\nwe never wanna leave it out where there is\nan opportunity to insert that discussion.\n\n90\n00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:37.892\nSo let's start by talking about Linux.\n\n91\n00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:42.060\nLet's talk a little bit about Linux\nprocessing accounting just a little bit.\n\n92\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.420\nThis idea of keeping track of what users\nare doing in Linux is very important.\n\n93\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.291\nAnd we can track the commands\nthat users execute in Linux.\n\n94\n00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.003\nAnd we can do them just\nlike we do in Windows.\n\n95\n00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.431\nLog files are generated,\nwanna know where those are.\n\n96\n00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.343\nEither at VAR, ADM for the admin account.\n\n97\n00:03:57.343 --> 00:04:04.731\nVAR log, or\nVAR log user would be where we would look.\n\n98\n00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:06.358\nWhen I say something like dash var,\ndash adm,\n\n99\n00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.290\nI know you have this in\nthe show note I think, right.\n\n100\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.860\nWe're talking about the path,\n\n101\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.920\nthe statement where we'd actually go in\nthe sub directory to be able to find that.\n\n102\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.270\nSo we'll look in different places,\nbut we have a log sub directory.\n\n103\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.330\nMuch like we would in Windows and\nwe see logs generated there.\n\n104\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.940\nWe could set up user account tracking and\n\n105\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.156\nunderstand information about\nwhat those users are doing.\n\n106\n00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:29.235\nWe use the last COM command to\nbe able to view those logs or\n\n107\n00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.595\nat least understand and\nlook at what the commands were.\n\n108\n00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:33.855\nThink about it logically,\nthe last com, last command.\n\n109\n00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:35.105\nWe can view those commands.\n\n110\n00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.225\nRemember we talked about\nDOS key in Windows,\n\n111\n00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:38.415\nwe've taken a look at that before.\n\n112\n00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:41.495\nSo kinda just thinking about what that\nlooks like in Linux a little bit and\n\n113\n00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:44.895\nmaking sure we're comfortable with and\naware of some of those odds and\n\n114\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:47.875\nends that may be important for\nus on the forensics side.\n\n115\n00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:50.545\nWe talked about before\nthe fact that we may not be in\n\n116\n00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:53.440\na Linux system looking at it\nas often as we are in Windows.\n\n117\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.140\nThat doesn't mean it doesn't happen.\n\n118\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.780\nAnd that doesn't mean we don't have\na need to be able to understand how to\n\n119\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.940\noperate in Linux.\n\n120\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.460\nBut like anything else, right,\nwe go with our strengths.\n\n121\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.051\nAnd we do the things that we need to\ndo on a regular basis very often and\n\n122\n00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.197\nrepetitively and we're good at those.\n\n123\n00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:11.529\nAnd things we're not gonna do very often,\nwe may have to work a little harder at.\n\n124\n00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.559\nMost forensic investigators have\na sense of how to work in a Linux,\n\n125\n00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:15.740\nUNIX environment.\n\n126\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.850\nBut Linux, UNIX is a specialized area.\n\n127\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.880\nIt's very different from Windows.\n\n128\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.605\nAnd as we've talked about,\nwhile it's a lot closer to the Mac OS,\n\n129\n00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:24.720\nit's not that exactly either.\n\n130\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.690\nAnd we have to understand how to\nwork there, especially in UNIX.\n\n131\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.860\nUNIX is gonna be kind of that hardcore,\n\n132\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.730\noriginal thought process compared to\nwhat Linux may have morphed into.\n\n133\n00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.870\nLinux these days, depending on the build\nare the version that you're running and\n\n134\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.010\nworking with will be called the distro,\nshort for distribution right?\n\n135\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.500\nSo the distribution of Linux you're using,\n\n136\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.430\nif you're using one of\nthe more modern versions.\n\n137\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.580\nRedhead Enterprise, Debian,\n\n138\n00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.420\nUbuntu whatever it may be,\nCentOS or something like that.\n\n139\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.990\nYou're a lot of times gonna have a\ngraphical interface, a shell of some kind\n\n140\n00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.010\nthat we talk about, and that graphical\ninterface is gonna give you a lot of\n\n141\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.900\nthe flexibility, and lets be honest, a lot\nof the usability we often find in Windows.\n\n142\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.060\nSo you're gonna have a menu structure,\nyou're gonna be able to interact with\n\n143\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.405\nthe directories without having to\nuse a shell essentially to do that.\n\n144\n00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:15.330\nA command line shell,\nessentially a non graphical interface.\n\n145\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.300\nNothing wrong with that, but for\nhardcore users who are really purists,\n\n146\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.090\nthey're not gonna do that.\n\n147\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.330\nThey're gonna run Linux without x Windows\nand without the graphical interface,\n\n148\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.600\nwithout the desktop or the graphical\nshell if you will, corn or bash,\n\n149\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.030\nor whatever you're gonna use.\n\n150\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.490\nAnd as a result, we're going to have\nto operate in the command line.\n\n151\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.990\nSo if you're doing any mainframe work,\nfor instance.\n\n152\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.982\nIf you're dealing with AS/400s,\nI Series I7,\n\n153\n00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:44.780\nI8 machines that you're going to be\nthe new iterations of some of these.\n\n154\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.540\nYou're gonna be working with\na nongraphical interface traditionally to\n\n155\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.370\nmanage some of this and you're gonna\nhave to understand the command lines.\n\n156\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.150\nSo it really just depends on what\nwe're doing and how we're doing it.\n\n157\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.930\nBut we don't wanna underestimate the value\nof the command line and we try to demo for\n\n158\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.500\nyou when we have done demos.\n\n159\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.180\nTools in the command line spend a lot of\ntime especially in the Windows Forensics\n\n160\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.072\nepisodes, there were five of them.\n\n161\n00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:10.380\nWe spent a lot of time in that topic\narea in a series of episodes and\n\n162\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.040\nshows showing you a lot\nabout different tools.\n\n163\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.910\nBut I would say conservatively maybe at\nleast a quarter to maybe as much as half\n\n164\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.810\nof that time, was spent in the actual\ndemos in the command line looking at tools\n\n165\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.770\nthat you operate from the command line as\nopposed to graphical tools using the SIS\n\n166\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.060\ninternals tool set and locate a lot\nof the built in commands in Windows.\n\n167\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.290\nI mean there was just a wealth of commands\nin the Windows environment that can be run\n\n168\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.780\nthat we don't need to go out and\nget any special tools to use.\n\n169\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.750\nSo we do wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of that and\n\n170\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.320\nthat we remind ourselves of that.\n\n171\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.240\nSo some of the common Windows security\nevent Log I.D.s., let's go in and\n\n172\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.920\nif we could just take\na look here real quick.\n\n173\n00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.601\nLet's bring back up the event viewer.\n\n174\n00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:47.491\nI did not leave it up.\n\n175\n00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:48.667\nSo let me open it back up.\n\n176\n00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.200\nWe'll bring that up, just take a second.\n\n177\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.447\nLet's go into Windows logs.\n\n178\n00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:54.024\nLet's go to security here.\n\n179\n00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:59.448\nAnd where we see the event I.D.,\nand let me just.\n\n180\n00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:04.151\nMove this over here, it'll be easier for\nus to zoom in on, when we look at this,\n\n181\n00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:08.858\nI just move the event idea over to the,\nyou have middle column there, easier for\n\n182\n00:08:08.858 --> 00:08:12.509\nus to take a look at when we show\nyou what we're talking about,\n\n183\n00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:16.720\nyeah, we can see an ID 4672 of 4624,\n4735, 31, etc.\n\n184\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.300\nit is a bunch out there, at least may or\nmay not be important to us, may or\n\n185\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.040\nmay not tell us something For\n\n186\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.810\ninstance 4672 says special\nprivileges assigned to a new logon.\n\n187\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.880\nNow, we may want to know that,\nobviously, but\n\n188\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.810\nthat's not one of the common ones we see\nvery often, so we did put up a list there,\n\n189\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.520\nright, and we do have a list for you.\n\n190\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.328\nWhat were some of the ones on the list,\njust while I zoom out real quick?\n\n191\n00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:37.705\nI know I gave you a list,\ncan you read through [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n192\n00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah not a problem, we've got\n528, which was a successful logon.\n\n193\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.560\n529, the logon attempt was made\nwith an unknown username, or\n\n194\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.910\na known username with a bad password.\n\n195\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.864\nSo, that action happening.\n\n196\n00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:55.085\n530, just going right down the list,\n528, 29, and we're into 530.\n\n197\n00:08:55.085 --> 00:09:00.460\nAn attempt was made to log on with the\nuser account outside the allotted time.\n\n198\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.185\n531, logon attempt using\na disabled account.\n\n199\n00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:04.482\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's stop there for\njust a second.\n\n200\n00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:05.585\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a good one, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted have\n\n201\n00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:08.053\na minute to set up this other item\nthat I want to show real quick.\n\n202\n00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:10.643\nSo, Daniel just rattled off what,\nfour or five probably, right?\n\n203\n00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:12.483\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Of the event codes I gave you,\n\n204\n00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:15.399\nthere's a whole bunch of them there,\neverything from 528,\n\n205\n00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.315\nI think sequentially through\n540 is pretty much listed, and\n\n206\n00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:21.120\nthen a couple in the 600 range for\nterminal services.\n\n207\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.520\nDefinitely want you to\ntake a look at this.\n\n208\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.980\nSo, do go in and\ntake a look at the show notes.\n\n209\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.740\nBut let me show you, if you wanna\nfind one of those Event ID codes,\n\n210\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.660\nhow do we pull that out,\nhow do we go in and filter?\n\n211\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.480\nSo, all I did was I came in here,\nand I went and\n\n212\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.220\nI filtered current log,\nright over there, right?\n\n213\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.240\nBrought up the filter screen right here.\n\n214\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.070\nSet up the, as you get vertigo,\nbecause I'm going zoom, zoom, zoom,\n\n215\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.180\nzoom back and forth, you can see that\nI put in on that line right there,\n\n216\n00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.200\nwhere number 528 is,\nit says hey, event ID.\n\n217\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.760\nWhat event ID do you want to look for?\n\n218\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.330\nSo, I'm going to go in and I'm going to\nfilter this, click 528, and if I see any\n\n219\n00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.200\nof those, they would show up here, and\nI would actually be able to find them.\n\n220\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.480\nNow, it doesn't look like I have any, so\n\n221\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.880\nthere are no event ID's of\nthat particular type in here.\n\n222\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.060\nBut you could see that I would go in,\nand I would be able to go ahead and\n\n223\n00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.460\njust look through the log, looking for\nevidence of this information.\n\n224\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.678\nSo, I could just start filtering for\nany of these event IDs, and\n\n225\n00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:16.712\nthen I could simply take the filter off.\n\n226\n00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:19.980\nAnd remove it.\n\n227\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.576\nAnd I could go in, and I could do,\ninstead of 528 successful logon,\n\n228\n00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:29.482\nlet me look for, I haven't really logged\nin badly or anything like that, or\n\n229\n00:10:29.482 --> 00:10:31.879\nlogged in outside of the time frame.\n\n230\n00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:36.691\nLet's see if there's anything on 540.\n\n231\n00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:38.050\nOkay, we don't see any of those either.\n\n232\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.060\nActually, what we probably would need\nto do is go into the system log,\n\n233\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.440\nas opposed to security log.\n\n234\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.916\nLet's see if maybe, let me just see,\nreal quick, if we could find it in there.\n\n235\n00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:47.645\n&gt;&gt; Are you logged off at all, 5:38?\n\n236\n00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:48.410\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't.\n\n237\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.240\nThat's one of the things I\nhaven't logged off at all.\n\n238\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.140\nSo, that's the thing,\nI just left it running.\n\n239\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.494\nSee, I don't see any of those in here,\nand that's fine, but\n\n240\n00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:58.280\njust showing you a general idea of\nhow we'd do a little filtering.\n\n241\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.930\nSo you could go in, obviously, let me take\nthat filter out of there, can apply that.\n\n242\n00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.470\n&gt;&gt; In a large domain network, this would\nbe filled up with all of these just,\n\n243\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.970\nprobably.\n\n244\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is just,\nwe're just generating some basic traffic,\n\n245\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.730\ndoing some demos,\nwe're not really hooked up to a domain.\n\n246\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.290\nRight, I don't have a lot of\nstuff going on the way that\n\n247\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.420\nit would in the real world.\n\n248\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.710\nThis is really just a very limited\nvision of what we're showing you, but\n\n249\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.350\nI just wanna give you a sense of the fact.\n\n250\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.720\nWe can go in and filter for those,\nso you may look for some of those.\n\n251\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.130\nAnd obviously, may find ones\nthat may be of interest to you.\n\n252\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.410\nSo, just pay attention to the ones\nthat we told you to take a look at.\n\n253\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.612\nIt may be helpful for you to be aware of.\n\n254\n00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:35.545\nThe other thing for you to look at,\nI mentioned IIS and IIS logging,\n\n255\n00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:36.856\nweb-based logging.\n\n256\n00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:40.800\nWhen we've talked about some of the\nWindows areas in the past, and the Windows\n\n257\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.680\nforensics, episodes, I mentioned in\na couple of other places as well.\n\n258\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.060\nBut I wanted to show you what the iOS\nmanagement interface looks like, not so\n\n259\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.800\nmuch because you as an investigator\nmay have to go in and look at it, but\n\n260\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.480\nbecause there's configuration issues\nhere with regards to how logging is done\n\n261\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.040\nthat you may want to be aware of.\n\n262\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.110\nNow, where do we find logs for iOS?\n\n263\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.330\nWell, that's important for us to take\na look at and to be aware of as well.\n\n264\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.030\nI've mentioned before that\nwe can come in here, and\n\n265\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.810\nwe'll see for instance, if we go in.\n\n266\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.110\nLet me just pull this down,\nso you can see this,\n\n267\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.370\nthat in the, oop, hold on one second.\n\n268\n00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.300\nThere we go.\n\n269\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.490\nIn the INET.pub directory,\nwhen we install Windows,\n\n270\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.330\nor on Windows Server,\nif we install the IIS function.\n\n271\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.250\nLet me just center that a little bit,\n\n272\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.450\nI wanna make sure you can see\nthat path in there as well.\n\n273\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.800\nThere we go, kind of like that.\n\n274\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.891\nSo in the local drive, wherever it is.\n\n275\n00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:37.411\nSo, we're gonna go into inetpub, and\nyou can see there in the inetpub directory\n\n276\n00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:41.346\nI've got FTP, I've got history,\nI've got logs, etc., ww root.\n\n277\n00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:46.318\nIf I go to that logs directory, that's\nwhere I'm gonna find logs for IIS, right,\n\n278\n00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:47.181\nso I can go in.\n\n279\n00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.884\nI'm gonna see that there is a WMSQC.\n\n280\n00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:55.720\nSo, I can go on look for logs in\nthere filled with request log file.\n\n281\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.690\nThere's different logs that will be\ngenerated and put in different places.\n\n282\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.070\nBut I can go and then take a look for\nof these logs inside the web server.\n\n283\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.770\nAnd when we go in,\n\n284\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.350\nand we take a look, I've loaded up\nthe web server, when I installed it here.\n\n285\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.250\nAnd so, I went in,\nI put in full support for everything,\n\n286\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:16.080\nso we got all the ASP.NET stuff,\nI got a full FTP installation.\n\n287\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.380\nYou can see right there FTP logging\nfront and center, middle of the screen.\n\n288\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.990\nWe could configure that.\n\n289\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.330\nYou could see right down there IIS itself,\nand\n\n290\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.300\nI've got the configuration information and\nlogging is right there.\n\n291\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.220\nWe can kinda see both FTP and\nnormal logging right there.\n\n292\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.310\nSo I could go in, and I would be\nable to see where logging is set up.\n\n293\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.890\nWhat kind of logging is being done, and we\nwould then get a better sense of the kind\n\n294\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.680\nof information we may be able to generate,\nor\n\n295\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.130\nmore importantly that we would be\nlooking at with regards to IS.\n\n296\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.160\nLet's just go in.\n\n297\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.530\nLet's just click on logging real quick,\nand\n\n298\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.860\nlet's just take a look at\nsome of the settings there.\n\n299\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.960\nSo, it says when we go to take a look,\n\n300\n00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.140\nuse this feature to configure\nhow logs are setup, so\n\n301\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.780\none log per, one log file per site right\nnow, so we're doing one log file per site.\n\n302\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.420\nOur standard log format is w3c,\nthe directory there, so\n\n303\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.970\nsystem drive line at publogs,\nI told you where to find that, and\n\n304\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.730\nthen the encoding for the log, and then\nthis is what's really important as well.\n\n305\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.620\nWhat's the rollover schedule for\nthe logs, create a new file?\n\n306\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.080\nWell, it looks like right now,\nby default, we're doing it daily,\n\n307\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.570\nwhich means that we should expect to\nsee a log file generate once per day,\n\n308\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.170\nhowever big it winds up being.\n\n309\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.310\nAnd we'd wanna know that,\ncuz if we start to look and\n\n310\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.750\nsee these log files and we don't find them\nsequentially, we know somebody went in and\n\n311\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.130\nmanipulated information, to try to\nhide something most likely from us.\n\n312\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.850\nAnd that's something for\nus to be aware of.\n\n313\n00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.550\nSo system root inet\\pub\\logs is where\nwe're gonna want to take a look or\n\n314\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.630\nwherever we actually\nhave put that logfile.\n\n315\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.810\nNow remember, system root,\nsystem drive, same idea here.\n\n316\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.880\nIn this case, it'll be C for us.\n\n317\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.530\nSystem root would be Windows.\n\n318\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.280\nRight, it depends on where you install.\n\n319\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.600\nAnd keep in mind that we\nmay manipulate the path for\n\n320\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.370\nthe installation of a web server.\n\n321\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.930\nIt may not sit in the root directory,\n\n322\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.180\nso we need to know that we\nhave to go look for it.\n\n323\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.760\nAnd one of the true ways, right,\nprobably best way to find it other than\n\n324\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.846\nspelunking around, right,\nI worked that cool word of the day in.\n\n325\n00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:12.650\nOther than just kinda hacking around\nin the system, what we can simply do is\n\n326\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.740\ncome to the configuration of\nthe server and just take a look.\n\n327\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.070\nIt always tells us exactly where to go,\nand we can see system drive inetpub\\logs,\n\n328\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.970\nas I've showed you,\nis where we're gonna go.\n\n329\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.860\nSo, we want to make sure we're familiar\nwith this, we see what's happening here.\n\n330\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.710\nIf we go back out, we go to FTP and\nlook at FTP logging.\n\n331\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.150\nWe'll see essentially\npretty much the same thing.\n\n332\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.480\nWe're not using FTP, but we'll see that\nwe can see our netpub log log files,\n\n333\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.830\nin coding for but what's interesting\nhere is that we can select the fields.\n\n334\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.350\nIt's important to know\nwhat fields are available,\n\n335\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.908\nwe can select the fields that we actually\nwant to capture in the log files.\n\n336\n00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:51.437\nAgain, If this is not done ahead of time,\nat that point,\n\n337\n00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:54.465\nwe're not gonna be able to go back and\naccess that additional data.\n\n338\n00:15:54.465 --> 00:15:57.493\nBut it is important to know how\nthe log file was set up, so\n\n339\n00:15:57.493 --> 00:15:59.369\nwe know what data to expect to see.\n\n340\n00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:02.692\nAn investigator should drill in and\nlook at this information, so when we\n\n341\n00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:07.070\nlook at the logs, we're sure we're seeing\neverything that we're supposed to see.\n\n342\n00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.260\nNow, this is what the default\ninstall looks like.\n\n343\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.363\nWe may, obviously, potentially want\nto set up our systems ahead of time,\n\n344\n00:16:13.363 --> 00:16:15.916\nto have Verbose logging\ncapture everything.\n\n345\n00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:19.659\nThat way if there is a breach or anything\ngoes wrong, we would be able to know and\n\n346\n00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:21.380\nhave detailed information.\n\n347\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.410\nFor instance, things like server name.\n\n348\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.380\nAnd you'll notice there,\nBytes Sent and Received.\n\n349\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.630\nNotice Time Taken, and notice\nAdditional Information are not selected,\n\n350\n00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.870\nalong with Client Port.\n\n351\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.878\nWe're missing certain information, in\nother words, that may actually be helpful.\n\n352\n00:16:34.878 --> 00:16:39.230\nAnd it would be good for us to have\nknowledge of that and to be aware of that.\n\n353\n00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:45.270\nWe actually can do the same thing in the\nIIS log, so in the web server log itself.\n\n354\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.490\nThis for W3C log in,\nsame exact thing, but you'll notice\n\n355\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.620\nas we go down on the website, instead of\non FTP, but on the web server itself,\n\n356\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.530\non the HTTP protocol,\nwe see that we have some additional stuff.\n\n357\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.220\nWe've got cookies, for instance,\nwhich were not logging with FTP, but\n\n358\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.348\nwe probably would want to capture here.\n\n359\n00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:08.090\nAgain, we'd wanna see that if it was\nin the log, but it may not be selected.\n\n360\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.490\nMaybe it's just not preconfigured,\nit's not there.\n\n361\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.020\nSo we have to know about that, right?\n\n362\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.230\nSo there is some\nprerequisite knowledge here.\n\n363\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:19.650\nSome need for us, as administrators in\nthe system, to think ahead and understand\n\n364\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.850\nwhat we may wanna capture so that we\nhave data that's available forensically.\n\n365\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.141\nBut we also, as investigators who,\nby the way, are typically are not the same\n\n366\n00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:29.670\npeople as the people that\nadminister the systems, have to\n\n367\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.170\nunderstand there may be limitations\non what the administrator has set up.\n\n368\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.496\nAnd as a result,\nwe may not get everything we want.\n\n369\n00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:37.070\nAnd this is kinda the tight rope,\n\n370\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.190\nthe balancing act we have to\nwalk around and deal with.\n\n371\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.490\nAnd we have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that, so keep that in mind.\n\n372\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.890\nThat's going to be really important for\n\n373\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.880\nyou as we look at some of\nthese configuration areas.\n\n374\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.920\nBecause we have to understand that things\nmay not always be what they appear to be.\n\n375\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.950\nWe can assume there's a lot of data there.\n\n376\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.198\nBut maybe there is, maybe there isn't,\nwe just don't know.\n\n377\n00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:58.470\nAll that logging, by the way, in the web\nis done in fix ASCII text-based formats\n\n378\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.020\nand you can't modify that, but\nyou can add the headers and\n\n379\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.740\nthe other information in the column fields\nand then you can pull those logs up.\n\n380\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.570\nBut you're not able to modify\nthe actual information.\n\n381\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.450\nYou could simply just look at the way\nit's been pulled together, so\n\n382\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.330\nkeep that in mind.\n\n383\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.440\nBut as you saw, a lot of basic things are\ngonna be configured and captured there.\n\n384\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.302\nWe do capture logs in UTC time,\nI think I mentioned that.\n\n385\n00:18:18.302 --> 00:18:21.120\nJust wanna make sure that\nyou're aware of that as well.\n\n386\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.370\nLet's talk about DHCP and talk about\nDNS and where they log to for a minute.\n\n387\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.420\nSo DHCP, have the path to show you here,\n\n388\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.586\njust already brought that up and\ninstalled that.\n\n389\n00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:36.660\nYou can see C Windows 32 DHCP right there,\nas I lean so\n\n390\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.140\nfar forward I almost come right into\nyour living room as you're watching me.\n\n391\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.400\nIt'd be great if we did 3D,\nwhere I could actually come out and\n\n392\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.350\nI could shake someone's hand\nwhile they're watching.\n\n393\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.480\nOr I could show them a log file.\n\n394\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.259\nI actually saw this cool,\nI forget what movie it was..\n\n395\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.240\nIt wasn't a movie, you know what it was?\n\n396\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.130\nYou ever watch Family Guy?\n\n397\n00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit.\n\n398\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there was a Family Guy episode\nI caught a couple of nights ago when I was\n\n399\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.520\ndoing some work.\n\n400\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.380\nCuz when I'm actually\ntyping up my show notes,\n\n401\n00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.175\nI'm not really working,\nI'm doing everything else but that.\n\n402\n00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.925\nBut when I was getting\nsome notes together for\n\n403\n00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:07.035\nthe shows, I happened to have\nit on in the background.\n\n404\n00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:10.235\nAnd I just happened to turn around\nwhen they were showing this, and\n\n405\n00:19:10.235 --> 00:19:11.365\nMeg, the daughter character, right?\n\n406\n00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:13.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is sitting in the movie theater and\n\n407\n00:19:13.375 --> 00:19:15.860\nthey're doing a 3D thing, so\neverybody has the glasses on.\n\n408\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.170\nAnd so they're sitting watching, and\nthen all of a sudden this massive nose,\n\n409\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.395\nlike five feet long,\n\n410\n00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:26.310\njust pokes out of the screen and is like\nright in front of her because of the 3D.\n\n411\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.470\nBut it was like one of these\ncame right out at you moment.\n\n412\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.570\nSo I was kinda trying to get that effect,\ndidn't work real well obviously.\n\n413\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.720\nBut anyway, we're gonna stop digressing.\n\n414\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.590\nThat was our random aside,\nby the way, for our episode.\n\n415\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.320\nSo DHCP, let's go back and\ntake a look at what we're doing here.\n\n416\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.800\nSo our DHCP log, can we go full screen for\na second just so\n\n417\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.830\nthey can see that without\nme being in the way?\n\n418\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.880\nThank you very much.\n\n419\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.480\nSo that's our path right there, and you'll\nsee that we do have log files, right?\n\n420\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.500\nSo you see what ever log-thu,\nyou have the day of the week Thursday.\n\n421\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.390\nAnd we can do Thursday.log and\nthen we'd have everyday.\n\n422\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.080\nAnd then we've got some other logs\nthat are iterated base on numbers,\n\n423\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.890\ntemporary logs and\nother files that are meant and used for\n\n424\n00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.030\nvarious functions in the DHCP server.\n\n425\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.800\nSo I can go in and\n\n426\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.170\nread and interact with those logs\nif I need to as an investigator.\n\n427\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.040\nAnd I may be able to\nfind some information.\n\n428\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.980\nI haven't used the DHCP server,\nI haven't set it up yet.\n\n429\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.220\nSo if you take a look,\nwhat we'll see is that those logs,\n\n430\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.440\nmajority of them, don't have a lot\nof size associated with them.\n\n431\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.432\nExcept the reserve logs, the system logs\nthat are reserve logs in the system,\n\n432\n00:20:27.432 --> 00:20:29.439\nthose are gonna be set up at a megabyte.\n\n433\n00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:32.800\nBut everything else is empty, cuz I\nhaven't actually used the system yet.\n\n434\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.100\nThat knowledge just in and of itself,\n\n435\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.050\njust looking at the size of the log file,\ntells me something about the system.\n\n436\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.640\nAnd we wanna know that and\nwanna be aware of that.\n\n437\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.122\nThe other thing that we need to be aware\nof is, if I go to try and open up.\n\n438\n00:20:46.122 --> 00:20:48.600\nI'm just gonna give it a second\nto actually load, there we go.\n\n439\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.730\nTry to open up one of these file that\nhas the letter j and a whole bunch\n\n440\n00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.200\nof letters in front of it, or numbers\nin front of it rather, 500, 2 whatever.\n\n441\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.614\nYou'll see it's got just a bunch\nof wing ding garbage in there,\n\n442\n00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:04.283\nbecause this is an active log that's\nbeing used by the DHCP server and\n\n443\n00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:06.958\nit's being written to in\na non-human language.\n\n444\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.418\nAnd we wouldn't be able to just read that,\n\n445\n00:21:08.418 --> 00:21:11.020\nwe'd have to have an interpreter\nto see what's actually in there.\n\n446\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.880\nSo we'd have to know that if we open\nthis log file up to examine it,\n\n447\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.260\nwe may need a special tool\nto interpret what's there.\n\n448\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.190\nWe could see the path,\nobviously we see that.\n\n449\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.460\nBut unless you speak a wing ding, we're\nnot gonna know what the ankh sign and\n\n450\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.560\nt and whatever that stuff is, all that.\n\n451\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.570\nBut we got a pretty little music\nsymbol there, a little sun.\n\n452\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.100\nWe got some underscores and\na little enyo there.\n\n453\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.650\nSo there's some kind of cool stuff, right?\n\n454\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.980\nBut nothing that really\nmakes any sense to us.\n\n455\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.120\nSo just be aware of the fact that you\ncan't just necessarily open this log\n\n456\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.690\nand look at it.\n\n457\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.510\nYou gotta actually use some special\ntools that may show us what's going on.\n\n458\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.370\nWhat about DNS?\n\n459\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.373\nLet's take a look in here at DNS.\n\n460\n00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:51.630\nWent in, and\nwe've got our DNS interface, our MMC.\n\n461\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.390\nAnd you can see that we've\ngot global logs there.\n\n462\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.990\nThat's gonna point to the DNS\nentries in the Windows Event Viewer.\n\n463\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.760\nSo we've got information there.\n\n464\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.780\nBut we also can go in, we can bring\nup the properties of the server.\n\n465\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.810\nLet's just move that over there.\n\n466\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.280\nAnd we can come here to debug logging.\n\n467\n00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.110\nAnd we can enable, it's not turned on by\ndefault, but we can enable logging there.\n\n468\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.770\nWe can also enable and\nmodify event logging.\n\n469\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.880\nNow, again, after the fact, this is not\ngonna give us a lot of data if it wasn't\n\n470\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.180\nturned on and running before the breach.\n\n471\n00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.110\nBut if this happens to have been\nconfigured and running, we'd be able\n\n472\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.960\nto extract a lot of the data out of these\nlogs and it would be very useful to us.\n\n473\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.000\nSo we may, again,\nwanna think about the set up.\n\n474\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.790\nAnd you'll see that, by default, under\nevent logging, we log all events, but\n\n475\n00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.250\nwe may have modified that.\n\n476\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.947\nSomebody may have gone and\nsaid, hey, you know what?\n\n477\n00:22:42.947 --> 00:22:44.160\nDon't log any events, and\n\n478\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.290\nmaybe they wanna mask the fact that\nthey're in there messing around.\n\n479\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.010\nAnd we have to be aware of that and\nlook for\n\n480\n00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.310\nthe settings to correlate\nwith what we're seeing.\n\n481\n00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.690\nAnd this is, again, the methodology,\nthe thought process of trust but verify.\n\n482\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.480\nLook for everything, make sure we\nunderstand, and document all the settings.\n\n483\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.800\nAnd then cross reference that\nwith the material we're gathering\n\n484\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.500\nas an investigator to ensure\nthat what we're seeing and\n\n485\n00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.310\nhow we're seeing it makes sense to us.\n\n486\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.270\nAnd that we understand that this is\nlegitimately the way the interface\n\n487\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.330\nhas been set up.\n\n488\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.640\nSo we'd wanna go in and drill in and\nlook at the settings in the system,\n\n489\n00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.190\nand then correlate that with the logs.\n\n490\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.510\nNow the logs for DNS are going to be\n\n491\n00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:26.650\nIn, again, the same path,\nC:\\Windows\\System32, but DNS this time.\n\n492\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.740\nYou can see dns.log is sitting\nright there, we have that log file.\n\n493\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.220\nAnd, again, no size to it right now.\n\n494\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.855\nI haven't actually used the DNS system,\nI just set it up just merely for a demo.\n\n495\n00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:38.665\nBut we could see that there\nis a log file there, and\n\n496\n00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:41.695\nwe'd wanna be aware of that and\njust have a sense of that so\n\n497\n00:23:41.695 --> 00:23:45.495\nthat we know where DHCP logs are found,\nwe know where DNS logs are found.\n\n498\n00:23:45.495 --> 00:23:48.175\nWhat about non-common services?\n\n499\n00:23:48.175 --> 00:23:51.105\nAnd when I say non-common,\nwhat I mean is a service that we may or\n\n500\n00:23:51.105 --> 00:23:53.700\nmay not be using on a regular basis.\n\n501\n00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.682\nWhat about something like ODBC and\n\n502\n00:23:55.682 --> 00:23:58.560\nour database connections\nout to another system?\n\n503\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.030\nWe wanna make sure we know how to log for\nthose, or\n\n504\n00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.043\nat least know they are gonna be logged and\nthat we can go in and\n\n505\n00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:07.390\nwe can make a connection or\nat least Think about the logic of that.\n\n506\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.892\nWhen we come in and\nwe go to administrative tools, and\n\n507\n00:24:09.892 --> 00:24:13.115\njust bring that up so you can see that,\nactually let me do it this way so\n\n508\n00:24:13.115 --> 00:24:16.930\nyou can see it's back there behind\nadministrative tools before we zoom in.\n\n509\n00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.960\nBut I went to administrative tools,\nwent to data sources ODBC, and\n\n510\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.940\nI have my data source administrator.\n\n511\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.968\nSo I would set up typically an ODBC\nconnection to be able to connect out to\n\n512\n00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:28.861\na data source of some kind right?\n\n513\n00:24:28.861 --> 00:24:30.950\nOpen database connectivity.\n\n514\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.980\nThe idea is that I'm gonna be\nable to create a pipe essentially\n\n515\n00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.170\nout to a data source.\n\n516\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.370\nNow we do this a lot with Microsoft and\nnon Microsoft\n\n517\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.680\ndata sources to bring in system\ninformation and we set up the connections.\n\n518\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.410\nOnce we've done that the ODBC logs\n\n519\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.000\nare set up based on the configuration\nparameters of the connection.\n\n520\n00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.700\nSo we may find them in random places,\nmay find them in unusual places, so\n\n521\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.170\nwe've gotta go and\nwe've got to take a look.\n\n522\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.300\nAnd so if we look at something like,\naccess database, and well,\n\n523\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.630\nlet's see if we can get in.\n\n524\n00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.410\nI may not be able to look at either one,\nyeah cuz I don't have them set-up.\n\n525\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.780\nI can't look at these.\n\n526\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:13.180\nLet me do the following, let's just\ntake a look at a DNN, or DSN real quick.\n\n527\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.904\nAnd so, you'll, if we were to set this up,\njust to show you the information they may\n\n528\n00:25:16.904 --> 00:25:20.482\nprovide, you know, connect out to let's\nsay a new data source like SQL server.\n\n529\n00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:24.295\nI'd have to give it a name, a description,\nwhere I wanna connect to, now I can't do\n\n530\n00:25:24.295 --> 00:25:27.681\nthis because I don't really have a SQL\nserver set up, but in providing this\n\n531\n00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:31.386\ninformation, I'm creating a connection\npathway out to an existing instance.\n\n532\n00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:34.319\nOnce I have done that there is logging\non the SQL side that will occur and\n\n533\n00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:37.761\nI have to go in and investigate those logs\npull them out separate from this system.\n\n534\n00:25:37.761 --> 00:25:42.294\nBut there maybe logs on this side from the\nuse of the application that may also be\n\n535\n00:25:42.294 --> 00:25:44.130\nresident on this machine.\n\n536\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.191\nSo I'd have to know as an investigator\nthat there are connections to other data\n\n537\n00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:51.892\nsources and I may have to bring those\nin and understand how to find them.\n\n538\n00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:55.939\nAnd again drilling through this\nlooking at this configuration area,\n\n539\n00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:59.779\nlooking at the ODBC datasources,\njust going through these tabs,\n\n540\n00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:02.130\nseeing what's there would be helpful.\n\n541\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:06.514\nSo for instance, in one of the earlier\ndemonstrations on, or rather,\n\n542\n00:26:06.514 --> 00:26:11.720\nnot one of the earlier demonstrations but\none of the episodes that will\n\n543\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.420\nfollow us here but we've actually done for\nyou on mobile forensics.\n\n544\n00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.819\nAnd you can take a look at that,\ndoes show up or\n\n545\n00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:22.257\nwe do have the installation of a piece of\nsoftware, called Mobile Edit Forensics.\n\n546\n00:26:22.257 --> 00:26:25.700\nAnd you can see I've got a DSN\nconnection out to it to represent it and\n\n547\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.944\nI can actually set up\ninformation about it.\n\n548\n00:26:27.944 --> 00:26:31.839\nAnd I can look at the file connection, I\ncan also see whether or not there are any\n\n549\n00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:35.100\nlogged that may be delivered or\ncreated as a result of using this.\n\n550\n00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.780\nSo I would want to know that as\nan investigator in this area.\n\n551\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.280\nSo this is the kind of thing\nwe also want to think about.\n\n552\n00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.165\nThough we may not necessarily in our minds\nas investigators you always think about\n\n553\n00:26:45.165 --> 00:26:46.310\nthe logic of this.\n\n554\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.080\nBut it is important for us to go in and\n\n555\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.960\nto examine where all these\nconnections take place.\n\n556\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.630\nAnd to be aware of the fact that they are\nthere because we may miss vital pieces of\n\n557\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.340\nevidence If we don't understand where\nall the logs are going to be located.\n\n558\n00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.653\nSo it's going to be really important for\nus to be thinking about these things and\n\n559\n00:27:00.653 --> 00:27:03.927\nhave a sense of them and know where they\nare and how they're going to interact.\n\n560\n00:27:03.927 --> 00:27:06.887\nWhat about legal issues associated\nwith using the logs, or\n\n561\n00:27:06.887 --> 00:27:10.820\nlogs like we found here, to be able to\nprovide evidence in a court of law.\n\n562\n00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.720\nHow are we gonna do that?\n\n563\n00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.380\nWe talked in earlier episodes about\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n564\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.970\nthe United States vision of how evidence\nshould be managed in a courtroom.\n\n565\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.469\nWe mentioned and\nif you haven't seen this one,\n\n566\n00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:21.750\nI encourage you to go back, take a look.\n\n567\n00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.602\nMentioned extensively\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n568\n00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:28.430\ntalked about different rules in\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence body.\n\n569\n00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.242\nWe talked about rules around just what\nit means to be an expert witness,\n\n570\n00:27:32.242 --> 00:27:36.066\nwe talked about rules with regards\nto what it means to offer testimony.\n\n571\n00:27:36.066 --> 00:27:40.713\nFederal Rules of Evidence rule number 803,\nrecords of regularly conducted\n\n572\n00:27:40.713 --> 00:27:44.470\nactivity as evidence,\nwanna just talk about this for a minute.\n\n573\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.716\nI've got a little quote of the rule.\n\n574\n00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:48.420\nIt's actually, in the show notes,\nyou can read the whole quote.\n\n575\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.340\nBut essentially, what it does is it\nlists for us the things associated\n\n576\n00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.770\nwith information, things like memorandums,\nreports, records, data compilations.\n\n577\n00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.710\nHow we get those, and how those may or\nmay not be entered into evidence.\n\n578\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.990\nAnd so let me just quote this or\nread this for you.\n\n579\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.940\nSo memorandum, report record or data\ncompilation In any form of acts evidence.\n\n580\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.002\nExcuse me, of acts, events, conditions,\nopinions or diagnoses made at or\n\n581\n00:28:12.002 --> 00:28:16.062\nnear the time by or from information\ntransmitted by a person with knowledge if\n\n582\n00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:19.385\nkept in the course of regularly\nconducted business activity.\n\n583\n00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:23.153\nAnd if it was the regular practice\nof that business activity to make\n\n584\n00:28:23.153 --> 00:28:26.383\nthe memorandum report,\nrecord, or data compilation,\n\n585\n00:28:26.383 --> 00:28:29.094\nall is shown by the testimony\nof the custodian.\n\n586\n00:28:29.094 --> 00:28:32.238\nOr other qualified witness,\nunless the source of information or\n\n587\n00:28:32.238 --> 00:28:36.450\nthe method or circumstances of preparation\nindicate lack of trustworthiness.\n\n588\n00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:41.316\nThis is essentially the element, the\nportion of the rule specific to whether or\n\n589\n00:28:41.316 --> 00:28:45.467\nnot we can use regularly conducted\nactivities, evidence of them.\n\n590\n00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:49.109\nA log file for instance would\nfall into this category, a diary,\n\n591\n00:28:49.109 --> 00:28:52.280\na journal that somebody kept,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n592\n00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.660\nWe can introduce that into evidence\nunder certain circumstances\n\n593\n00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.650\nas long as we meet\ncertain burdens of proof.\n\n594\n00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.990\nWhat those rules are is important for\nthe investigator to be aware of.\n\n595\n00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.150\nAnd so this little snippet of the rule\nspeaks to how we may do that.\n\n596\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.980\nSo it's important for us to know because\nif we are able to introduce this\n\n597\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.050\ninformation into evidence\nthat may be very beneficial.\n\n598\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.500\nBut if we're not we may then try\nto provide this evidence and\n\n599\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.000\nsay well look I found this in the log or\nwhatever.\n\n600\n00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.860\nBut you know what?\n\n601\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.650\nHey The Drudge says, as we've talked\nabout in some of those episodes.\n\n602\n00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.770\nSorry, but\nyou know what we can't accept that right?\n\n603\n00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.540\nSo we have to understand and be aware\nof the fact that we can't just say hey,\n\n604\n00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.900\nwe want to produce this thing.\n\n605\n00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.982\nAnd I talked about in part one,\n\n606\n00:29:29.982 --> 00:29:34.949\nthe the prior episode before this\ntalked about the fact that forensically\n\n607\n00:29:34.949 --> 00:29:40.256\ngathering those logs from somebody\nwho runs the system potentially.\n\n608\n00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:43.419\nMay be a problem for us if we're not able\nto validate that they gathered those logs\n\n609\n00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:44.348\nin the proper manner and\n\n610\n00:29:44.348 --> 00:29:47.320\nwe're not involved in that log\nacquisition Information process.\n\n611\n00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.604\nSo we have to think about the legal issues\nassociated with using logs as evidence is\n\n612\n00:29:50.604 --> 00:29:51.996\nwhat I'm suggested to you right?\n\n613\n00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:56.196\nThere are custodial or other qualified\nwitness that knows about the logs and\n\n614\n00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:59.270\ncan testify to the way in\nwhich they were gathered.\n\n615\n00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.158\nThe way in which they were produced,\nyou know all those things,\n\n616\n00:30:02.158 --> 00:30:04.846\nthey have to testify to\nthe accuracy integrity of the logs.\n\n617\n00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:06.120\nIt's very important.\n\n618\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.040\nIf we can't do that, the logs may not\nbe shown to be proper, and as a result,\n\n619\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.450\nthey may not be valid, and may not be\nallowed to be introduced in evidence.\n\n620\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.970\nWe have to offer testimonies to what kind\nof system was used, what kind of software,\n\n621\n00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.920\nwhat methodology, the do's and don't's if\nyou will, around how logs were gathered.\n\n622\n00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.580\nAnd if we can show that there's\na record of failure on this system.\n\n623\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.762\nThat, in other words, throughout\nthe course and the use of this system, or\n\n624\n00:30:28.762 --> 00:30:31.963\nthis process, or this person doing it,\nthat there have been compromises.\n\n625\n00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.800\nThere have been security issues,\nthere have been faults.\n\n626\n00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.015\nWe may throw doubt or cast shadow and\ndoubt on the gathering of that evidence.\n\n627\n00:30:40.015 --> 00:30:41.515\nAnd those logs may not be admissible.\n\n628\n00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:44.915\nWe may be actually essentially able to\nsay, hey, you know that Daniel guy, right?\n\n629\n00:30:44.915 --> 00:30:47.025\nBoy, whenever he gathers logs,\nhe's awesome.\n\n630\n00:30:47.025 --> 00:30:49.580\nBut that Mike guy,\nboy whenever he gathers logs,\n\n631\n00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.240\nwe can never trust what we get from him.\n\n632\n00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.630\nAnd if Mike was the person who\nactually gathered the log, guess what?\n\n633\n00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.631\nThe judge may say,\nwell you know given what you told me,\n\n634\n00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:58.086\nshould have said it was Daniel, right?\n\n635\n00:30:58.086 --> 00:31:02.400\nBecause it's Mike and guess what,\nMike's not doing the job the right way.\n\n636\n00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.280\nAs a result we can't trust those logs.\n\n637\n00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.640\nSo we can cast doubt on that,\nif we can show that there's a pattern,\n\n638\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.500\nor evidence essentially, that shows\nthat there may be a problem with that.\n\n639\n00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.280\nAnd so we want to make sure that we're\naware of that because we can run\n\n640\n00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.260\ninto issues.\n\n641\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.630\nWhere logs may not be\nacceptable as evidence.\n\n642\n00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.550\nAnd as an investigator\nwe need to know that.\n\n643\n00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.140\nSomething to consider.\n\n644\n00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:20.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n645\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.840\nYou've got to remember our computers\nin a lot of ways are basically like\n\n646\n00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.760\nNSA CIA recording machines.\n\n647\n00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.057\nThey're always taking.\n\n648\n00:31:28.057 --> 00:31:30.306\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They're logging everything.\n\n649\n00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:34.581\nThere's a lot of things that are happening\nthat you may never even realize they\n\n650\n00:31:34.581 --> 00:31:37.882\nare making a log of but they are for\nthe system purposes and for\n\n651\n00:31:37.882 --> 00:31:39.810\nadministrative purposes.\n\n652\n00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.940\nEvery now and then we actually\nhave to go into those logs and\n\n653\n00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.570\ncheck them for something.\n\n654\n00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.430\nAnd maybe it's because there's been\nan event that needs to be investigated for\n\n655\n00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.300\nour purposes, right?\n\n656\n00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.490\nAnd that's what we're looking at today.\n\n657\n00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.233\nThat's the aspect in which we're taking\nit, or perspective, or should I say.\n\n658\n00:31:54.233 --> 00:31:55.460\nAnd that being said,\n\n659\n00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.190\nAdam has done a great job of reminding us\nof that fact that those logs are there.\n\n660\n00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.890\nWe just have to know where they are, and\nwhat we're looking at when we see them.\n\n661\n00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.305\nSo that we can use them as evidence.\n\n662\n00:32:07.305 --> 00:32:09.690\nAnd as information in our investigation.\n\n663\n00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.910\nThat being said, it does look like we\nare well out of time for this episode.\n\n664\n00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.020\nBut we're not even close to done.\n\n665\n00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.030\nWe have more.\n\n666\n00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.410\nOn this type of information for\nyou guys coming up, so\n\n667\n00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:23.100\nthere will be a part, that's right, three,\ntres hombres coming right back at ya, so\n\n668\n00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.586\ndefinitely,\n&gt;&gt; Three amigos.\n\n669\n00:32:24.586 --> 00:32:25.417\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I love that movie.\n\n670\n00:32:25.417 --> 00:32:26.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a cool movie, right.\n\n671\n00:32:26.661 --> 00:32:30.540\n&gt;&gt; So come back for the three amigos\nhere about logging in our CHFI series.\n\n672\n00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.705\nThat being said, let's go ahead and\nwe'll sign off for today or\n\n673\n00:32:32.705 --> 00:32:33.636\nthis episode should I say.\n\n674\n00:32:33.636 --> 00:32:34.753\n&gt;&gt; Not for today.\n\n675\n00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:36.074\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Sign off for today.\n\n676\n00:32:36.074 --> 00:32:36.720\n&gt;&gt; Not for today, just for this episode.\n\n677\n00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.915\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n678\n00:32:37.915 --> 00:32:41.625\n&gt;&gt; And I am an undetermined log file pipe.\n\n679\n00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:43.365\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time bye.\n\n680\n00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:50.836\n[MUSIC]\n\n681\n00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:57.149\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:08.451\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:08.951\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.380\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.840\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode it's more on CHFI.\n\n8\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.440\nSpecifically a part three for\nlogs and network capturing,\n\n9\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.540\nthings of that nature we've been\ndiscussing this our last few episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.670\nHopefully you're back for part three,\nif not, jump back to part one and two.\n\n11\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.310\nIt's good information there,\nand then catch back up with us.\n\n12\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.820\nAnd, of course,\njoining us back in the studio again\n\n13\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.180\nis the person that has been\ndecimating this information to us.\n\n14\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.770\nOur good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.140\nAdam, welcome back, how's it going?\n\n16\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.900\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nRemember part three is not the same as\n\n17\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.060\nparts one and two combined.\n\n18\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.601\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Right, even though normally we'd\n\n19\n00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.998\nsay that one plus two equals three,\nin this case you need\n\n20\n00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:55.505\nto see part three separately, so just\nremember your basic rule of mathematics.\n\n21\n00:00:55.505 --> 00:01:00.355\nOne plus two does not equal three when it\ncomes to logging and network forensics.\n\n22\n00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:01.900\nActually we're gonna keep going here.\n\n23\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.700\nTalk some more about log capturing,\nnetwork forensics, and\n\n24\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.040\nall the stuff that goes into this.\n\n25\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.550\nAs a CHFI, as\na Certified Hacking Forensic Investigator,\n\n26\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.210\nyou're expected to have knowledge\nof how to do these things.\n\n27\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.120\nYou're expected, if asked, and\n\n28\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.750\nyou very well may be,\nIf you plan on taking the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.405\n&gt;&gt; Under oath, even.\n\n30\n00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:19.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or perhaps under oath,\n\n31\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.149\nalthough you have to take the exam before-\n&gt;&gt; First, yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.508\n&gt;&gt; You get to the part\nwhere you get to swear.\n\n33\n00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:23.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You'll get to swear when you're done.\n\n34\n00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:26.880\nSo you may be asked\nabout Windows forensics.\n\n35\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.460\nHow do we capture logs and\nlook at them in Windows?\n\n36\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.130\nWe've talked about that extensively,\nshown you how to do that for\n\n37\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.575\nIAS with regards to FTP,\nDNS, DHCP, ABC, one, two,\n\n38\n00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:41.210\nthree, do re mi, you and me, here we go,\nlogging as we have talked about.\n\n39\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.650\nWe're gonna talk about syslogging in\nLinux and Unix in a minute as well, but\n\n40\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.716\nwe're expected to know\na little about that.\n\n41\n00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:50.681\nI mentioned in the last episode, we didn't\nget to it we're gonna do it again here,\n\n42\n00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:54.360\ntalking about NTP a little bit,\nright, a Network Time Protocol.\n\n43\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.200\nAnd so there's a lot of different\nmoving parts we gotta understand and\n\n44\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.230\nbe available, or have available to us,\nas a forensic investigator.\n\n45\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.201\nIt's as much about understanding where\nthings are, how they're set up, and\n\n46\n00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:11.093\nthe expectations of what we can see as\na result as it is about the specificity of\n\n47\n00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:13.295\nany one log and what it may tell us.\n\n48\n00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.106\nIf we miss a whole category of information\nbecause we don't know its there,\n\n49\n00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:21.205\nas we've talked about in prior episode,\nthat's a really bad thing, right.\n\n50\n00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.975\nWe've joked around and said that's an RGE,\nit's a resume generation event, but\n\n51\n00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:28.615\nit may actually, all kidding aside,\nbe the difference between success or\n\n52\n00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.095\nfailure with regards to\nthe ability to prosecute a crime.\n\n53\n00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:33.005\nBecause you may not be able\nto present that evidence.\n\n54\n00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.405\nOr if you do present it, it may not be\ntaken by the court as being legitimate,\n\n55\n00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:39.765\nas we talked about with regards to\nthe federal rules of evidence and some of\n\n56\n00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:44.640\nthe standards and concerns we have about\nthe way in which evidence was captured,\n\n57\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330\nthe way in which it was documented,\nthe way in which we may have\n\n58\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.280\ngenerated that evidence, and whether or\nnot it is seen as being legitimate.\n\n59\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.050\nSo gotta think about those things.\n\n60\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.620\nSo for\n\n61\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.705\nregards to syslog, you don't often hear\nus talk about syslogging much these days.\n\n62\n00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:00.610\nSyslogging is an old school concept,\nwith regards to logging and\n\n63\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.190\ntaking logging from a system, and\nthen bringing it to another system,\n\n64\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.760\ntypically across the wire, and then,\nessentially, managing logging there.\n\n65\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.210\nWe talk about it, but we don't really talk\nabout it using that language anymore.\n\n66\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.695\nInstead it's been replaced\nby the concept of SIEM.\n\n67\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.604\nSIEM, SIEM, SIEM whatever you\nwould pronounce it as, but\n\n68\n00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:20.801\nsecurity information event management,\nS-I-E-M is the concept that we talk about\n\n69\n00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.921\ntoday that really has kind of\nreplaced this idea of syslogging.\n\n70\n00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.958\nNot in actuality in the sense\nthat it really is syslogging, but\n\n71\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.838\nrather just in the way we describe it and\nthe technology we use to do it.\n\n72\n00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:34.320\nWe may be using something like Splunk,\na pretty common tool today for\n\n73\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.500\nthis kind of activity.\n\n74\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.370\nWe maybe using any kind of syslog system\nwhether it's an old one, a new one, or\n\n75\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.480\nanything in between.\n\n76\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.957\nBut the idea is we're gonna take\nthose logs form multiple systems,\n\n77\n00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.397\ncentrally aggregate them,\ncombine them, and\n\n78\n00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:50.701\nfocus them in some sort of data warehouse,\nmore often than not.\n\n79\n00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:55.029\nAnd then allow the use of a big data,\nor data intelligence, data analytics,\n\n80\n00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.091\ndata visualization tools to be able\nto understand and see the trending in\n\n81\n00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:03.410\nthe data, but also to examine the data and\nunderstand what's there.\n\n82\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.240\nSo in Unix and Linux,\nwhile we do have these capabilities,\n\n83\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.665\nwe still traditionally kind of\nrefer to them as syslogging.\n\n84\n00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.588\nAnd so syslogging in Linux and\nUnix is controlled through a config file,\n\n85\n00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:14.723\nas almost everything is in that world.\n\n86\n00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:18.903\n/etc/syslog.conf is what the name of the\nfile is traditionally, what you'd go and\n\n87\n00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:19.707\nlook for.\n\n88\n00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:21.916\nYou would edit this file, or\nat least as an investigator,\n\n89\n00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:23.643\nhave knowledge of the fact\nthis file exists.\n\n90\n00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:27.629\nAnd may have to look at the configuration\nof the file to understand where the syslog\n\n91\n00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.553\nserver is, how we're sending data to it,\nwhat to expect, where to go to look for\n\n92\n00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:33.665\nit, all the things that we'd wanna know.\n\n93\n00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:39.195\nWe use UDP, Universal Datagram,\nor User Datagram, Protocol, or\n\n94\n00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:42.690\nUniversal Data Protocol,\nor you, I really like you,\n\n95\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.120\nyou're a data and I like your protocol.\n\n96\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.440\nYou can call it all sorts of\ndifferent stuff, but we use UDP,\n\n97\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.330\nthe protocol that is connectionless.\n\n98\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.130\nEssentially send and\nforget is what we often refer to it as.\n\n99\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.510\nAnd when we use UDP,\n\n100\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.000\nwe're using it on port 514 traditionally\nwith syslogging in Linux/Unix systems.\n\n101\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.320\nNow, I say traditionally because obviously\nwe can modify that if we choose to.\n\n102\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.040\nSo it's not a hard coded port\nwhere it's gotta always be that.\n\n103\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.130\nBut it is traditionally used with that\nprotocol and that port configuration.\n\n104\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.110\nWould an investigator need to know that?\n\n105\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.810\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea for\nus to know that.\n\n106\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.870\nIf we're ever asked about it,\nperhaps on an exam at some point,\n\n107\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.590\nit would be good for\nus to know about that.\n\n108\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.130\nBut more importantly, do we need to\nunderstand that in the real world so\n\n109\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.980\nthat as we're examining network traffic\nand looking for evidence of syslogging\n\n110\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.070\nthat we know where to look and\nhow to look and what to look for?\n\n111\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.640\nYeah, it would be a good\nidea to know that.\n\n112\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.910\nIf you remember, we took a look at how to\nuse a network capture program to capture\n\n113\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.570\nvolatile data across a network\nin real time and examine it.\n\n114\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.580\nI showed you how to use the network\nchemistry protocol analyzer\n\n115\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.180\ntool to do that.\n\n116\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.160\nWe can use all sorts of different tools.\n\n117\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.800\nBut if we saw traffic and drilled in and\nstarted to look for UDP traffic and\n\n118\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.220\nlook for traffic on that port,\nwe may see evidence of syslogging,\n\n119\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.940\nwe'd be able to validate\nthat that was going on.\n\n120\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.630\nSo it'd be good for\nus to know that and be aware of that.\n\n121\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.199\nBut remember that these days,\nas I said in the Windows world,\n\n122\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.090\nbecause we're using SIEM systems more and\nmore, they may take place on, or\n\n123\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.970\nthis information may be gathered,\non a variety of ports.\n\n124\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.600\nSo we have to look at vendor by vendor,\nport by port,\n\n125\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.210\nconfiguration by configuration to\nunderstand what's happening there.\n\n126\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.290\nAnd we need to have an understanding\nof the fact that a lot of this traffic\n\n127\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.220\ntransits across the web today.\n\n128\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.080\nSo we may see it mixed in with other\ntraffic because of cloud based services.\n\n129\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.070\nSo HTTPS, generically, is the carrier\nprotocol on port 443 traditionally.\n\n130\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.300\nThey represent all sorts of traffic,\nand as we showed you in the capture\n\n131\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.265\ndemonstration, we saw set up traffic,\nbut then we went and\n\n132\n00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:32.725\nlooked at a data packet as well and\nwe actually saw raw data there.\n\n133\n00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.495\nSo we have to understand\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n134\n00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:36.045\nIf the data's encrypted,\n\n135\n00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.265\nwe may not be able to understand what it\nis unless we have the keys to decrypt it.\n\n136\n00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.745\nThat doesn't mean we don't capture it,\n\n137\n00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:42.745\njust means we capture it in a form\nthat may not be useful to us.\n\n138\n00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:45.515\nSo wanna understand some of these\nthings and understand more about them.\n\n139\n00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:49.815\nWe did talk about NTP a little bit in\nthe last episode, Network Time Protocol,\n\n140\n00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.865\nright, running on port 123, so\nyou wanna be aware of that.\n\n141\n00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.105\nIt's an Internet standard protocol.\n\n142\n00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:55.830\nIt's used to synchronize time.\n\n143\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.510\nEither between us and a time server\nthat is external to our organization.\n\n144\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.970\nThe atomic clock traditionally is used.\n\n145\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.960\nSo the US government maintains that.\n\n146\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.960\nThere are other time\nservers around the world.\n\n147\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.880\nIn a Windows environment, you typically\nsync to your domain controllers.\n\n148\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.730\nThose are NTP sources.\n\n149\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.160\nSo we may have a rack mount NTP device.\n\n150\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.660\nSo we have, essentially, a clock, right,\nthat's running inside the organization\n\n151\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.890\nthat is used as a reference point for\neverybody and we could set this up.\n\n152\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.348\nWe could reference it very easily in\nWindows, but we also can actually\n\n153\n00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:28.115\nhard code in the registry where we want\nthat to be set up and how we wanna do it.\n\n154\n00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:31.181\nIf we wanna use the Windows time service\nto use an internal hardware clock,\n\n155\n00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:32.310\nwe could actually do that.\n\n156\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.150\nI'm gonna show you how\nto do that in a minute.\n\n157\n00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.400\nBut, are you familiar with the idea,\nDaniel, of with NTP, cuz I know you\n\n158\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.795\nknow about NTP, but are you familiar\nwith the concept of stratum levels?\n\n159\n00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:42.482\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I have ever\nheard of that honestly.\n\n160\n00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:45.950\n&gt;&gt; So interesting little thing about NTP\na lot of people don't realize with NTP and\n\n161\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.080\ndon't know about.\n\n162\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.370\nBut NTP, in it of itself, would just\nset it up and sync and say, okay boom,\n\n163\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.958\nthere you are, there's my clock.\n\n164\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:52.781\nIt's what I go to.\n\n165\n00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:57.500\nBut we actually measure with this\nconcept known as stratum levels,\n\n166\n00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.997\nS-T-R-A-T-U-M, stratum.\n\n167\n00:07:59.997 --> 00:08:01.096\nStratum levels.\n\n168\n00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:04.299\nWe actually measure what kind\nof sync device we look at.\n\n169\n00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:07.994\nIn other words, in stratum level zero,\nwe're using a direct device that is\n\n170\n00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:12.530\ndownstream from us, so we are referencing\nthe distance from the reference clock.\n\n171\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.680\nAnd by using different level identifiers,\nwe're talking about different cutouts or\n\n172\n00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.790\nessentially different\nlevels that we go through.\n\n173\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.510\nSo when we reference the stratum\nlevel with stratum level zero, we're\n\n174\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.830\ntalking about a clock that is assumed\nto be accurate and little or no delay.\n\n175\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.680\nIt's right next to essentially,\nit's one hop away if you think about that\n\n176\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.350\nlogically, if we reference\nstratum level one.\n\n177\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.230\nWe're talking about a time server\nthat we are not directly linked to\n\n178\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.230\nover a network path,\nbut is available to us.\n\n179\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.300\nIf we're talking about Stratum Level Two,\n\n180\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.260\nwe get our time over a network link\nvia NTP, from a Stratum One server.\n\n181\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.150\nSo we're talking about setting up\ndifferent hierarchies as we go and\n\n182\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.050\nessentially how we connect.\n\n183\n00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.380\nKind of an interesting concept, it's in\nthe underlying architecture of NTP, but\n\n184\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.850\nit's not something that\nmost people are aware of.\n\n185\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.320\nNow, how would we know all this?\n\n186\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.305\nWell, If you remember one of the very\nearly episodes that we talked about and\n\n187\n00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:04.290\nhad with you, I don't remember the exact\nname of the episode right now, but\n\n188\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.929\nI know Daniel made this point.\n\n189\n00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.310\nHe talked about the owner's manual.\n\n190\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.353\nAnd we actually went out and took a look\nat the, I think it was the tttt right?\n\n191\n00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:11.010\n&gt;&gt; TCP, right, yeah.\n\n192\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.820\n&gt;&gt; We took a look at TCP and I showed\nyou that we should take a look at and\n\n193\n00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.180\nread the owner's manual essentially for\nthese protocols as an investigator.\n\n194\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.420\nAs a information security professional.\n\n195\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.009\nJust kinda network tactics 101, right?\n\n196\n00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:23.980\nUnderstand that.\n\n197\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.150\nIs there an RC up there for NTP?\n\n198\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.400\nYou better believe there is, right?\n\n199\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.268\nHave you read it?\n\n200\n00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:29.640\nI don't know if you have or not.\n\n201\n00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.890\nBut if you haven't, and\nyou wanna find out more about it,\n\n202\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.150\nthis is where you would go to actually\nunderstand some of this stuff.\n\n203\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.957\n&gt;&gt; It's like being a special\noperations operator and\n\n204\n00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:39.740\nnot knowing how to use a gun, right?\n\n205\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.490\nWell I know what a gun is, but\nI don't know how to use the thing.\n\n206\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.590\nWe want to be able to use these tools.\n\n207\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.590\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, well in other words,\nwhat are these tools,\n\n208\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.243\nwhat are the tools techniques, rules of\nessentially doing your job, right, and\n\n209\n00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:49.184\nthis is what you gotta know.\n\n210\n00:09:49.184 --> 00:09:52.962\nSo speaking about doing your job and\nstuff you gotta know,\n\n211\n00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:56.444\nwhy don't we take a look at\nsomething you gotta know.\n\n212\n00:09:56.444 --> 00:09:59.182\nSo I thought about tv an said you\ncan set it up its real simple,\n\n213\n00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.485\nlets talk about how to do it.\n\n214\n00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:02.411\nCan we go full screen,\ncuz I wanna show you where to click.\n\n215\n00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:06.570\nSo all I did was click on the clock\nright here, I clicked on the clock.\n\n216\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.370\nClicked on the clock,\nI went to change date and time settings.\n\n217\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.845\n&gt;&gt; What did we do before we had zoom?\n\n218\n00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:15.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How did we actually like,\n\n219\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.370\nhow did we operate?\n\n220\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.150\nWhat did we actually do?\n\n221\n00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.170\n&gt;&gt; We zoomed with our face.\n\n222\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.130\n&gt;&gt; I guess we just moved closer to\nthe screen, I guess that's what you did.\n\n223\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.101\nSo when you zoom in here what you'll\nsee is right up at the top there\n\n224\n00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:27.278\non the third tab over,\nInternet Time, right?\n\n225\n00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:31.040\nAnd that's where we're gonna actually\ngo to setup NTP on a system.\n\n226\n00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.530\nWe go in there, click Change Settings and\n\n227\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.110\nwhat we have is the ability,\nas you can see and normally by default,\n\n228\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.360\nthis is how it's set up,\nsynchronized with an internet time server.\n\n229\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.890\nSo we could see that we are syncing out,\n\n230\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.390\nin this case, time.windows.com,\nthat's the traditional one.\n\n231\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.440\nBut we have a pull down there,\nwe can sync to other ones.\n\n232\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.520\nOr I'm gonna show you how\nto hack the registry and\n\n233\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.170\nset it up to sync with something locally.\n\n234\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.800\nSo I'm gonna show you how\nto do that right now.\n\n235\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.600\nBut we could go in and we could as you'll\nsee, use one of the US governments\n\n236\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.135\ntime servers, the atomic clocks that\nthis maintains, things like that.\n\n237\n00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:04.795\nSo, we could choose any of those,\nit's really up to us to decide.\n\n238\n00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:06.665\nAnd then, of course,\nwe have our domain controllers, as well.\n\n239\n00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:09.725\nI'm in a stand alone system,\nthis is not linked to a domain, so\n\n240\n00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:13.922\nI have no KDC or domain controller\nthat I would connect to here normally.\n\n241\n00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:16.962\nBut in the real world, if I was in\na domain, I would probably see the domain\n\n242\n00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:20.102\ncontrollers being referenced for\nthe time server here for a domain member.\n\n243\n00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:22.402\nWe can set that by group policy as well,\nby the way, in Windows.\n\n244\n00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:24.312\nSo just something else to consider.\n\n245\n00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:29.380\nIf we want to go ahead, and we want to\nactually take on the Windows registry, and\n\n246\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.040\nwe want to figure out how to go in,\nI'm just gonna zoom in there so\n\n247\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.600\nyou can see that little reg\nkey while we're talking.\n\n248\n00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.620\nBut we wanna configure the Windows time\nservice to use an internal hardware clock.\n\n249\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.150\nThese are the steps, or\nthis is the key that you're gonna go to.\n\n250\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.920\nI'm gonna show you what to do to do this.\n\n251\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.950\nBut you'll see where in HKEY,\nlocal machine system, current control,\n\n252\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.490\nset services, w32, time config, right?\n\n253\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.250\nSo we've gone on that key in\nthe registry and when we do that,\n\n254\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.470\nwhat we'll have up there is on the right,\nsomething called the announce flags.\n\n255\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.290\nAnd we have to go in and\nset the announce flag setting and\n\n256\n00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.620\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna modify that.\n\n257\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.190\nAnd when we modify it,\nwe're gonna edit the d word value,\n\n258\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.700\nit's got a reg d word, you can see there.\n\n259\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.320\nSo unlike some of the ones we\nlooked at earlier that were binary,\n\n260\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.520\nsome of the other episodes and\nshowed you how to do the conversion and\n\n261\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.590\nwork with that stuff,\nthis one's a ridge viewer.\n\n262\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.540\nIt's gonna be a slightly\ndifferent data type.\n\n263\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.590\nWe're gonna go in and do the following.\n\n264\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.490\nLet's just go in and\ntake a look at how to modify that.\n\n265\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.790\nSo we'll bring that up.\n\n266\n00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.280\nJust bring this over, kinda center screen.\n\n267\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.730\nWe'll scroll back in real quick.\n\n268\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.230\nYou'll see we have a value data there\nof a I believe, a little lowercase a.\n\n269\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.430\nWe can see that there.\n\n270\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.980\nAnd so when we set that up that allows\nus when we put in the a value to be\n\n271\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.730\nable to go ahead and to then say, hey,\nI want to use a internal clock or\n\n272\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.180\na hardware device that may be internal\nas opposed to something external.\n\n273\n00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.460\nSo if I set that key up, announce flags,\nset a value of a, and then I go ahead, and\n\n274\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.800\nI stop and I start.\n\n275\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.800\nThen that time service, so\nI do net stop, win 32 time, or\n\n276\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.200\nWindows time service, rather.\n\n277\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.339\nNet stop 32 time, that's start win\n32 time, that change takes affect.\n\n278\n00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:06.739\nSo I can actually set that up if\nI wanted to do that and go in and\n\n279\n00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:10.240\nactually then make it reference\na internal hardware clock.\n\n280\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.050\nWhich is the internal windows clock, or\n\n281\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.448\nthe clock on the system\nthat we'll often use.\n\n282\n00:13:14.448 --> 00:13:17.230\nSo I can actually go in and do that, and\n\n283\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.950\nI can hack away at the registry\na little bit in Windows.\n\n284\n00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.763\nNow again, would it be important for\nthe investigator to go in,\n\n285\n00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:26.600\nto take a look at the settings, to know\nwhere we're getting time-synced from?\n\n286\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.565\nIt's probably a good\nidea to be aware of that.\n\n287\n00:13:28.565 --> 00:13:33.430\nBecause again, the idea would be that if\nwe're not sure what time sync we're using,\n\n288\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.370\nhow do we know what the time stamps and\nlog files are?\n\n289\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.740\nHow do we know if they're accurate?\n\n290\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.990\nHow do we know if there's what\nwe call time drift right?\n\n291\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.575\nWhich is an issue you had actually\ntalked a little bit about this,\n\n292\n00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:45.019\nyou had a story from one of\nthe things that had happened to you,\n\n293\n00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:48.133\none of the other places you'd been at\nsome point of your life doing something.\n\n294\n00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:49.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know those vague stories Daniel\n\n295\n00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:50.200\nalways tells, right?\n\n296\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.040\nBut he had actually told a story in one of\nthe other episodes about having to go and\n\n297\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.620\nactually fix a time drift\nissue on a machine, and\n\n298\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.120\nhow we had to do that, and\nhow we used the registry to do that.\n\n299\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.980\nSo went in and did some of those things.\n\n300\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.820\nSo it's something to be aware of and\nto think about, right.\n\n301\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.530\nSo we wanna make sure that as we're going\nthrough and we're dealing with this,\n\n302\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:12.710\nthat we are aware of the fact\nthat having access to and\n\n303\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.990\nability to understand what that time\nsynchronization process looks like\n\n304\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.650\nis gonna be very, very important for us.\n\n305\n00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.261\nCuz as we look at log files,\nif we can't validate the timestamp and\n\n306\n00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:26.648\nthe local time on the machine is seemingly\nout of sync with everything around it,\n\n307\n00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:28.664\nthat indicates that there's been.\n\n308\n00:14:28.664 --> 00:14:32.424\nNot indicates, there has been indicates\nthat there definitely was some sort of\n\n309\n00:14:32.424 --> 00:14:35.940\nattempt to modify time, because of that,\nthat could be an issue.\n\n310\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.250\nAnd we would have to take note of that and\n\n311\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.920\nbe aware that, and say investment\ncould be very important for us.\n\n312\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.740\nSo want to think about that, just to\nmake sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n313\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.448\nNow we've shown you before how\nto use the Windows time feature,\n\n314\n00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:48.150\nto be able to go in and\nlook at the local time on the system.\n\n315\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.060\nCan we check and\n\n316\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.430\nvalidate the local system time just\nby looking at the clocking windows?\n\n317\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.240\nI mean that's gonna be valid.\n\n318\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.670\nWe could look at that and\nsay yeah, that's the normal time.\n\n319\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.670\nIs that not gonna represent time\nbased on what the system clock is?\n\n320\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.180\nNo, those two are synced together.\n\n321\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.050\nYou see that time there, that's\nwhat's coming from the system clock,\n\n322\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.450\nthe BIOS and\nwherever you're keeping the clock.\n\n323\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.870\nWould there be a way to modify that and\noffset that?\n\n324\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.720\nWe can have time drift, right, associated\nwith syncing to a different system.\n\n325\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.215\nBut the point is that the BIOS,\nthe Windows clock, and\n\n326\n00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:19.030\nwhat we see at the command line would all\nrepresent the same time on the system.\n\n327\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.175\nIt's what we sync to outside, right,\n\n328\n00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:24.980\n[LAUGH] that we want to make sure we\nare dealing with and doing the right way.\n\n329\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.422\n&gt;&gt; Somebody kicked my chair.\n\n330\n00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:28.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't mind the animal like noises as we\n\n331\n00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:31.440\nhear some scratching around in the studio.\n\n332\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.280\nDaniel's just stretching the course\nof those long legs of his.\n\n333\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.125\nHe managed to hit the stool\nthat's sitting behind him, so.\n\n334\n00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good for you.\n\n335\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.465\nHey, we're not going to tell people about\n&gt;&gt; I'm a big dumb animal folks.\n\n336\n00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:42.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it happens, what can you say?\n\n337\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.790\n&gt;&gt; You'll notice, when we do the wide\nshot, can we do a wide shot for a second.\n\n338\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.935\nYou don't even see it in the wide shot.\n\n339\n00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:47.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But if you did notice it,\n\n340\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.350\nyou would see I don't have a chair\nbehind me for this exact reason.\n\n341\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.185\nBecause I would be the person who\n[CROSSTALK] randomly without thinking\n\n342\n00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:56.116\nabout it, is just kicking it and\nmaking noise.\n\n343\n00:15:56.116 --> 00:15:57.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And instead,\n\n344\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.856\nof course, I just stand here with\nnothing but the podium to lean on, so\n\n345\n00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:02.804\nI don't drift around or walk anywhere.\n\n346\n00:16:02.804 --> 00:16:04.506\nFamous for\nwandering around when I'm talking.\n\n347\n00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.909\n&gt;&gt; He's like a chained elephant,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n348\n00:16:05.909 --> 00:16:07.421\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am essentially, you don't see it but\n\n349\n00:16:07.421 --> 00:16:08.501\nI'm tethered to the console.\n\n350\n00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:12.242\nThey don't actually let me loose here,\nI've got a little ankle chain that keeps\n\n351\n00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:14.510\nme tied to the console so\nI can't wander too far.\n\n352\n00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.930\n&gt;&gt; If you're good,\nyou'll get your food tonight.\n\n353\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\nthey'll let me out only if I am good and\n\n354\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.110\nI produce enough episodes.\n\n355\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.240\nAll right, so just getting back\nto what we were talking about,\n\n356\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.150\nmake sure we understand\nthe concepts of syncing time.\n\n357\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.750\nNow, you wanna help me talk about\nthe OSI model a little bit?\n\n358\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go for it.\n\n359\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.390\n&gt;&gt; That's one of your favorite topics and\nactivities.\n\n360\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.260\nSo when we think about the OSI model,\n\n361\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.517\nand we're gonna give you\nthe condensed version, by the way.\n\n362\n00:16:33.517 --> 00:16:35.725\n[LAUGH] We're not going to\nsubject you to the normal-\n\n363\n00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:36.815\n&gt;&gt; CliffsNotes.\n\n364\n00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:38.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe normal version of the OSI model,\n\n365\n00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:41.655\nwhich does take a fair amount of\ntime to go through and explain.\n\n366\n00:16:41.655 --> 00:16:44.505\nWe're gonna assume, and I'm gonna\nbe very clear about the assumption\n\n367\n00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:47.615\nwe're gonna make here, and I'm gonna make\na recommendation to you all kidding aside.\n\n368\n00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:51.195\nIf you're watching this and you feel you\nneed a little more knowledge about the OSI\n\n369\n00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:54.365\nmodel, what it is,\nhow it works aside from the two or\n\n370\n00:16:54.365 --> 00:16:57.190\nthree minute overview we're about\nto go through here, encourage you\n\n371\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.450\nto definitely take a look at a lot of\nthe other episodes that are out there.\n\n372\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.890\nThere's been not just\nthe hosting work I've done or\n\n373\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.800\nDaniel's done but we kid around a lot but\ncertainly with Mike, with Ronnie I'm sure,\n\n374\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.360\nwith Wes, with probably anybody or\neverybody who's done shows here.\n\n375\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.760\nCertainly with Don I know he's\ndone shows on this kind of stuff.\n\n376\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.270\nYou can find one or\nmore episodes in a lot of different areas\n\n377\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.200\nthat will speak to what\nthe OSI model is in depth.\n\n378\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.700\nEncourage you to watch any of those,\n\n379\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.850\nI'm sure all of them are gonna\nbe very valuable for you.\n\n380\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.938\nWe're gonna give you the CliffsNotes\nversion, [LAUGH] very high level.\n\n381\n00:17:28.938 --> 00:17:31.920\nWe are gonna list, and\nI have put in the show notes for you, just\n\n382\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.390\na listing of the OSI model layers from top\nto bottom, layer seven down to layer one.\n\n383\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.290\nI put a couple of protocols in and\n\n384\n00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.660\nmost layers there, at least a reference\nto what would happen at those layers, but\n\n385\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.780\nwe didn't really go into\ndetail as to what goes on.\n\n386\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.146\nBut I do wanna maybe just give you a quick\noverview as to what's going on with\n\n387\n00:17:47.146 --> 00:17:47.850\nthe OSI model.\n\n388\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:53.386\nSo, let's talk about what kinda happens\nin the OSI model top to bottom, right.\n\n389\n00:17:53.386 --> 00:17:55.436\nHow do you think we should summarize, or\n\n390\n00:17:55.436 --> 00:17:59.476\nhow do you think we could tell the people\nout there what the OSI model is good for,\n\n391\n00:17:59.476 --> 00:18:01.850\nwhat does it do,\nmaybe in a couple sentences.\n\n392\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.120\n&gt;&gt; To me, what it does is it really\nhelps you understand what's happening\n\n393\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.050\nas data travels from one\nsystem to another, right?\n\n394\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.640\nHow it's being presented,\nhow it's being formatted, and\n\n395\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.050\nhow is it traveling, specifically\nwhat protocols are being used.\n\n396\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.170\nAnd that can come in very handy when\nthings start to break down, well,\n\n397\n00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.980\nwhere is it breaking down at?\n\n398\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.060\nIf I know the data has\ngotten to a computer but\n\n399\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.660\nit's not being presented very well,\nmaybe it's a presentation layer issue.\n\n400\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.050\nMaybe I don't support that file type,\n\n401\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.260\nthat's the kind of thing\nwe're looking for.\n\n402\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.530\nSo you gotta remember this, from top down\nit's application, presentation, session.\n\n403\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Transport.\n&gt;&gt; Transport, I'm going backwards,\n\n404\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.630\nI typically go the other way,\nI don't know why I did that.\n\n405\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Network.\n\n406\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Network, data link,\nand then physical, right?\n\n407\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.770\nSo you're starting from where\nyou're seeing it on a screen,\n\n408\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.220\nyour computer is actually working\nwith it down to the actual electric\n\n409\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.500\nsignal that is being transmitted\nacross some sort of medium,\n\n410\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.750\nmaybe a wireless or a wired medium,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n411\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.650\nSo we typically are trying to find where\nthat's breaking down, I find it very\n\n412\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.848\nhelpful when it comes to troubleshooting\nmostly, at least in my experience.\n\n413\n00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:09.380\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nit's a great overview and\n\n414\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.930\ngenerally hits the highlights for\nus, lays out the specificity\n\n415\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.610\nthat we need to approach this with\nfrom an investigative perspective.\n\n416\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.400\nLet's just layer in a couple of other\nthings that are gonna be valuable for us.\n\n417\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.700\nSo definitely hit all the highlights\nwith the layers, we did application,\n\n418\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.770\npresentation, session, transport,\nnetwork, data link, and physical.\n\n419\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.150\nThat's top to bottom by the way, so layer\nseven to layer one as Daniel indicated.\n\n420\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.300\nYou could understand and hopefully\nknow that the model was bidirectional,\n\n421\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.150\nso it does work in both directions,\nso it does go either way.\n\n422\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.770\nAnd while we're not gonna\ntear down the model and\n\n423\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.090\ntalk about all the things\nthat occur at what layer and\n\n424\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.690\nhow they work, I do wanna lay out for\nyou just a little bit more.\n\n425\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.300\nMaybe peel back the layers one more level\nbeyond where Daniel left us, just to give\n\n426\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.620\nus a little more sense of, as an\ninvestigator, what we need to be aware of.\n\n427\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.280\nSo let's start at the physical layer,\n\n428\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.250\nI'm gonna work from the bottom up just so\nwe can talk about some things that go on.\n\n429\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.840\nDaniel said hey, at the physical\nlayer electrical signals on the wire,\n\n430\n00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.100\nwireless or wired, looking at the actual\nraw packets, bits and bytes if you will.\n\n431\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.060\nThings like ADSL, ISDN, T1, SONET,\nthese are technologies and/or types\n\n432\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.290\nof transmission that\nare gonna be at layer one.\n\n433\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.860\nWe're gonna be looking at\nthe connectivity, is this important for\n\n434\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.510\nus as an investigator to be aware of?\n\n435\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.865\nYeah sure, we wanna understand what medium\nis being used, we wanna understand if we\n\n436\n00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:28.460\nused fiber optic versus copper wire\nbecause we may be able to tap into one\n\n437\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.950\nvery easily and not be able to tap into\none very easily using another mechanism.\n\n438\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.172\nAnd so\nwe'd wanna understand the physicality,\n\n439\n00:20:34.172 --> 00:20:37.410\nwe'd wanna understand the speed\npotentially of transmission,\n\n440\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.800\ncuz depending on the type of transmission\nwe're using, we may be able to send very\n\n441\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.920\nlarge volumes of data very quickly,\nwe wanna be aware of that.\n\n442\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.770\n&gt;&gt; And very far.\n\n443\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.270\n&gt;&gt; And very far, or not very far at all,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n444\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.770\nIt may be very easy to\nintercept a wireless signal\n\n445\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.080\nversus a wired signal that's on a cable\nburied in the wall and conduit that's\n\n446\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.880\ngonna be very tough to get to, so\nyou just have to think about these things.\n\n447\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.313\n&gt;&gt; We joked about the old vampire taps,\nbut that made it real simple, didn't it?\n\n448\n00:21:01.313 --> 00:21:02.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It did, and\n\n449\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.510\nthey were used, that's where the concept\nof tapping a phone line came from.\n\n450\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.100\nYou put a wire tap on,\nyou literally tap the wire,\n\n451\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.170\nyou plugged in a device that would\nbleed signals off the copper wire.\n\n452\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.970\nIt's a little bit different when you're\ndealing with fiber optic cable today,\n\n453\n00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.630\nwe don't tap in the same way, but\nit's essentially that kind of concept.\n\n454\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.630\nAt the data link layer,\n\n455\n00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.120\nright, we're talking about\nthings that are gonna happen.\n\n456\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.490\nAnd we showed you in the data\ncapture demonstration, right,\n\n457\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.275\nthe word we use to show you things, right?\n\n458\n00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:29.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, that whole thing we do,\n\n459\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.620\nright, where I play\naround with the machine.\n\n460\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.130\nBut we talked about the demonstration, or\nshowed you how to do a packet capture.\n\n461\n00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.410\nWe took a look at MAC addresses as\nbeing imported and said at one layer,\n\n462\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.750\nwe were looking at MAC addresses, and\nanother IP, and another protocol, right?\n\n463\n00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.070\nAnd so MAC addresses come out at layer two\nof the OSI model, wanna be aware of that.\n\n464\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.210\nProtocols like L2TP, layer two tunneling,\nare found there, right, so\n\n465\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.400\nwanna be aware of that.\n\n466\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.059\nAt the network layer, IP addresses,\nwe showed you that on the data capture,\n\n467\n00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:56.200\ntalked to you about why\nthose are important,\n\n468\n00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.947\nhow those can help us triangulate and\n\n469\n00:21:57.947 --> 00:22:01.466\nunderstand how to use information to\nfind where something was done from.\n\n470\n00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:03.163\nNow it is possible to spoof IP addresses,\n\n471\n00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:06.217\nis it possible to pretend to be somebody\nwe're not through masquerading,\n\n472\n00:22:06.217 --> 00:22:08.410\nabsolutely, it's definitely\npossible to do that.\n\n473\n00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.733\nAs an investigator we have to know\nthat just because we find data\n\n474\n00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:15.679\nin a data packet at one or more layers\nof this model in a capture of some kind,\n\n475\n00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:17.830\ndoesn't mean the data is accurate.\n\n476\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.440\nIt simply means that the data is there,\nand the reality is that\n\n477\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.250\nsomebody may have manipulated that\ndata and we have to understand that.\n\n478\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.020\nDo we have tools,\n\n479\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.460\nas I mentioned that we do, that we can\nuse to modify a MAC address, absolutely.\n\n480\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.140\nDo we have tools that help us\nto modify IP addresses, yeah,\n\n481\n00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.690\nit's not really difficult to modify\nan IP at all so be aware of that.\n\n482\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.700\nLayer 4, the transport layer,\nright, protocols like TCP and\n\n483\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.170\nUDP connection-oriented, connectionless.\n\n484\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.830\nI talked about the values, so did Daniel,\nof understanding the owner's manual for\n\n485\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.080\na protocol,\nunderstanding what it is capable of.\n\n486\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.540\nWe walked you through some of\nthe flags and the setup for\n\n487\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.870\nTCP when we looked at the data capture.\n\n488\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.060\nKnowing whether or not at the IP layer,\nlayer three, the packet has been\n\n489\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.770\nfragmented, and at layer four what\nkind of flags are being set for\n\n490\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.870\nthe data,\nare gonna be very important to us and\n\n491\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.708\nwe have to make sure we're aware\nof that and we understand that.\n\n492\n00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:08.070\nWhat about at the session layer,\nthings like NFS, network file system,\n\n493\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.640\nSMB, server message block.\n\n494\n00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.360\nThese are protocols and solutions that are\nfound that talk about how we structure and\n\n495\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.670\nset up communication.\n\n496\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.880\nBe important for us to know that as\ninvestigators, understanding how data's\n\n497\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.220\nbeing transmitted, what the rules are, and\nkind of the structure of that format for\n\n498\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.070\nthe data, that's gonna partially\nbe set up at the session layer.\n\n499\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.730\nDaniel mentioned the presentation layer in\nthe beginning of his little overview and\n\n500\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.020\nsaid hey, a lot of times there may be a\nproblem with the data type, or the format,\n\n501\n00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.550\nand things like that.\n\n502\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.330\nJPEG, ASCII as formatting and file types\nare gonna be found among many others,\n\n503\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.140\nright, at layer six,\nthe presentation layer\n\n504\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.050\nis all about how we structure data and how\nwe present it in human-readable format.\n\n505\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.469\nSo for us as investigators, as you've seen\nin many of the demonstrations we've done,\n\n506\n00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:52.694\nin many of the areas we've looked at,\nmany of the techniques and\n\n507\n00:23:52.694 --> 00:23:55.464\nthings that we've shown you\nin a variety of episodes.\n\n508\n00:23:55.464 --> 00:23:59.692\nIn steganography, in the hard drive and\nfile system discussions, in the Windows\n\n509\n00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:04.165\nforensics episodes, that's probably Eight\nor ten episodes right there, just those\n\n510\n00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:08.110\nthree topics alone, let alone all\nthe other stuff we've done around that.\n\n511\n00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:12.629\nIn mobile forensics, in all the different\nareas, when we've done these things, we've\n\n512\n00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:16.960\ntalked about, in one form or another,\nmanipulation at the presentation layer.\n\n513\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.800\nWe've shown you tools and techniques\nthat help you to zero in on that,\n\n514\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.470\nto detect that and to understand that,\nwith regards to being an investigator.\n\n515\n00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.780\nVery important for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n516\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.470\nIn fact that a lot of that manipulation,\n\n517\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.160\nespecially in the steganography\nconversation we had,\n\n518\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.930\ntakes place at layer six or at least we\nbroke it down and looked at it logically.\n\n519\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.230\nWe're manipulating file types.\n\n520\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:39.050\nWhen I use the WinX Editor to go in and\nI actually manipulated the header of\n\n521\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.800\nthe image file, that was essentially\nmessing around with the presentation data.\n\n522\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.340\nWe were doing that at layer\nsix in the OSI model.\n\n523\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.180\nSo you may not have seen the big\nsix flashing above my head,\n\n524\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.475\nthat was that whole subliminal data.\n\n525\n00:24:49.475 --> 00:24:51.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That we stenographically modified, and\n\n526\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.510\nput into the audio flow,\nand the video flow.\n\n527\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.090\nBut in reality, we're doing this at layer\nsix, it's something to think about.\n\n528\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.450\nWhat about at the application layer where\nDaniel started us off that journey?\n\n529\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:07.280\nRight at the top of the OSI model, HTTP,\nright, DNS, DHCP is protocols of services.\n\n530\n00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.830\nSOAP, dealing with web related issues,\ndeal with SOAP.\n\n531\n00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.320\nAll this kinda stuff, also when you\ntake a bath or shower by the way,\n\n532\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.330\nyou always use soap then.\n\n533\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.610\nYou always want to make\nsure you have clean data.\n\n534\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.170\n&gt;&gt; Once a month,\nwhether you need it or not.\n\n535\n00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n536\n00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.187\nYou got to do that all the time.\n\n537\n00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:22.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Simple object, vertical, and\n\n538\n00:25:22.823 --> 00:25:24.870\nthings like that, all very important.\n\n539\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.690\nAll this stuff's going to occur or\nexist and be functional at layer seven.\n\n540\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.590\nWhat do we, as investigators,\nneed to know?\n\n541\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.120\nWhat I often tell customers and\n\n542\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.300\nstudents when I'm teaching and\ntalking about the OSi model is\n\n543\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.950\nlayer seven is where you actually interact\nwith the model as an end user, right?\n\n544\n00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.380\nIt's what you see is tangible.\n\n545\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.252\nIt's you watching us, right now,\nI mean this is me talking to you.\n\n546\n00:25:43.252 --> 00:25:47.270\nYou've seen us on the replay\nwatching this episode either live or\n\n547\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.620\nafter the fact, in an application.\n\n548\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.430\nThat's layer seven,\nthat's you interacting with data.\n\n549\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.000\nCan we manipulate data at that level,\ncan we see data?\n\n550\n00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.740\nAre there things as an investigator\nwe need to be aware of?\n\n551\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.645\nWhat's the traditional way of saying that,\nyou betcha.\n\n552\n00:26:00.645 --> 00:26:02.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you better believe there is and\n\n553\n00:26:02.152 --> 00:26:05.081\nwe want to make sure that we're aware\nof that, and we understand that.\n\n554\n00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:09.193\nBecause that can be where we, as\ninvestigators, are going to have the most\n\n555\n00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:12.890\nimpact in terms of interpretation and\nunderstanding of data.\n\n556\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.740\nBut it's also where we\nhave to be very careful.\n\n557\n00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.210\nWhere we have to tread very lightly, where\nwe have to really have our antennas up,\n\n558\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.340\nand be on guard to understand that there\nare lots of things that can go wrong.\n\n559\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.230\nAnd that we can see data,\nbut not really see it.\n\n560\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.600\nAnd we can interact with it, but\n\n561\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.748\nnot really understand that we're\ntouching data In an unsound way,\n\n562\n00:26:29.748 --> 00:26:33.680\nin a way that forensically is going\nto impact that data negatively.\n\n563\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.150\nWe talked a lot about this, and\n\n564\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.360\na lot about if you're not careful,\nnot on your game, so to speak, right.\n\n565\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.853\nAnd really exercising sound\nforensic investigative principles,\n\n566\n00:26:42.853 --> 00:26:45.619\nthat chances are good,\nyou're going to screw it up.\n\n567\n00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:49.044\nYou get one bite at the apple, and\nif that bite is done in an incorrect or\n\n568\n00:26:49.044 --> 00:26:53.390\ninappropriate way, that's it, you're done,\nthere's nothing else you can do.\n\n569\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.930\nThe judge is not in the habit of saying,\nokay, hey Adam, no problem.\n\n570\n00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.076\nYou didn't get it right, go back.\n\n571\n00:26:58.076 --> 00:26:58.610\n&gt;&gt; You meant well.\n[LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:59.560\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, we're not busy today,\n\n573\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.270\nyou meant well,\nyou gave it your best shot.\n\n574\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.680\nHere's what you need to do.\n\n575\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.903\nCome on back, and then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll try this person and\n\n576\n00:27:04.903 --> 00:27:06.972\nthrow them in jail,\nbecause you'll get it right eventually.\n\n577\n00:27:06.972 --> 00:27:08.510\nWe're gonna give you a second chance.\n\n578\n00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.860\nThat doesn't happen, so\nwe have to understand, right?\n\n579\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.090\nWe have to understand that we got\nto get this right the first time.\n\n580\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.870\nSo important, so critical.\n\n581\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.390\nThis is where we fight the battle and\nwin or lose.\n\n582\n00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.640\nIt's at the application layer,\nbecause it's the tools we use,\n\n583\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.350\nit's the techniques we apply, it's the\nmechanisms that we are interacting with.\n\n584\n00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.450\nIt's the data we see and\nthe ways in which we do that\n\n585\n00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.260\nthat ultimately are going to tell\nus whether or not we're successful.\n\n586\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.680\nAnd it's at the application layer\nthat we are pulling all the levers,\n\n587\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.775\ninteracting with all the switching.\n\n588\n00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:41.055\nAnd manipulating the data, in ways\nthat will create success or failure.\n\n589\n00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:43.215\nSo we've really got to\nbe in line with that,\n\n590\n00:27:43.215 --> 00:27:45.775\nfocused on that, and\naware of that as we say.\n\n591\n00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:48.945\nSo the OSI model is actually\na very important thing.\n\n592\n00:27:48.945 --> 00:27:51.675\nThings we have to think about,\nthings we have to be aware of.\n\n593\n00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:54.400\nSo the real trick is whether\nDaniel can do a handstand.\n\n594\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.060\nAnd then recite the OSI mode, and\n\n595\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.510\nI'm going to call you out on this because\nyou told me you could, in Greek, right?\n\n596\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.210\nYou made a point in\nsaying you could do it.\n\n597\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.400\n&gt;&gt; I can read Greek.\n\n598\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.850\n&gt;&gt; You said I could claim it.\n\n599\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.940\n&gt;&gt; Greek language.\n\n600\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.060\nI don't even speak it.\n\n601\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.690\nIt's not spoken.\n\n602\n00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.500\n&gt;&gt; If you could do it in Sanskrit,\nthat would be awesome.\n\n603\n00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.970\nThat would be awesome.\n&gt;&gt; That would be like that.\n\n604\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:13.712\n&gt;&gt; I can do it.\nI already.\n\n605\n00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:14.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's get\n\n606\n00:28:14.749 --> 00:28:16.090\nthe Google Translate device going on.\n\n607\n00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.900\n&gt;&gt; One second, I've got this.\n\n608\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo that's the OSI model.\n\n609\n00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.041\nAgain, we're not going to go through\nthe entire thought process of everything\n\n610\n00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:24.290\nthat's going on there.\n\n611\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.870\nThere's so much more information\nyou want to be aware there.\n\n612\n00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.980\nWhat kind of device this operate and\nwhat layers.\n\n613\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.100\nWhat kind of connectivity do we expect.\n\n614\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.080\nWhether VPNs are set up.\n\n615\n00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.220\nWhat are layer protocols.\n\n616\n00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.350\nOr in between layer protocols,\nthere's two and a half, and\n\n617\n00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.005\nother layer protocols that exist\nat certain layers that straddle.\n\n618\n00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:43.730\nThere's all this other detail that\nwe talked about in other episodes.\n\n619\n00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.115\nAgain encourage you to\ngo take a look at those.\n\n620\n00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:50.005\nWould that information perhaps, be\nvaluable for you, when you look to sit for\n\n621\n00:28:50.005 --> 00:28:50.525\nthis exam?\n\n622\n00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:52.173\nIt wouldn't hurt, let me put it that way.\n\n623\n00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:55.075\nBut, we do have to assume some\nprerequisite knowledge and\n\n624\n00:28:55.075 --> 00:28:58.105\nyou have to obviously, do a little work\non your own to prepare for some of that.\n\n625\n00:28:58.105 --> 00:28:59.625\nWe could give you pointers and\nguidance and\n\n626\n00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:01.485\ntell you about things that\nwe think would be valuable.\n\n627\n00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:04.295\nBut then, you have to obviously go out and\nacquire that knowledge, and\n\n628\n00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:06.270\nacquire it forensically,\nin a sound manner, by the way.\n\n629\n00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.115\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n630\n00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:08.275\nAnd, make sure that you have it.\n\n631\n00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:10.620\nSo, just some hints for\nyou that may be valuable there.\n\n632\n00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.920\n&gt;&gt; A lot of interesting information today,\nright?\n\n633\n00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.410\nA lot of things that could might or\nmight not necessarily be for\n\n634\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.410\nyou immediately, but\na good foundational concept.\n\n635\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.630\nWe talk about OSI, you could write\nwhole books on that kind of thing, and\n\n636\n00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.570\nI think there are as a matter of fact.\n\n637\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.760\nDefinitely some in-depth IRCs.\n\n638\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.005\nCheck out the stuff,\nunderstand how that works.\n\n639\n00:29:30.005 --> 00:29:33.040\nBecause you never know where\nthe evidence is going to lead you.\n\n640\n00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.510\nAnd you understanding the underlying\nfoundation of how that stuff works, can\n\n641\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.160\nhelp you out in gathering that evidence,\nmaking sure you do it in the correct way.\n\n642\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.310\nAnd in just having a good\nunderstanding of it, speak about it,\n\n643\n00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.850\nmaybe if you get called or\nif you are writing a report about it,\n\n644\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.410\nyou need to know that stuff as well.\n\n645\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.148\nBut that being said,\nour clock is a little on the,\n\n646\n00:29:52.148 --> 00:29:55.691\nout of time side, should I say\n&gt;&gt; It actually isn't [CROSSTALK]\n\n647\n00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:56.627\n&gt;&gt; I know we have a little more,\n\n648\n00:29:56.627 --> 00:29:58.842\ntypically we go a little farther over\n&gt;&gt; Which is unusual for us.\n\n649\n00:29:58.842 --> 00:30:03.163\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know, but we wanted to make\nsure that we gave you a quality part four\n\n650\n00:30:03.163 --> 00:30:07.982\naccumulation, right, the quadrinity\nthat is- no, we're going into part four.\n\n651\n00:30:07.982 --> 00:30:09.296\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna go into part four.\n\n652\n00:30:09.296 --> 00:30:12.020\n&gt;&gt; We're going to do part four, so\nwe look forward to seeing you guys there.\n\n653\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.560\nBut as for this episode,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n654\n00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.810\nSo, thank you for watching,\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n655\n00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.004\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n656\n00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:21.316\n&gt;&gt; I'm a OSI model, they are two and\na half protocol, and\n\n657\n00:30:21.316 --> 00:30:23.287\nif you don't know what that is,\ngo look it up.\n\n658\n00:30:23.287 --> 00:30:23.895\nThat's right.\n\n659\n00:30:23.895 --> 00:30:26.369\n&gt;&gt; Have a good one, everybody.\n\n660\n00:30:26.369 -->

00:00:08.431\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.839\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.073\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n6\n00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:17.430\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.704\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.190\nAnd in today's episode it's more on CHFI.\n\n9\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.730\nAnd just when you thought it\nwas safe to go back to ITProTV,\n\n10\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.550\nwe're having a part four.\n\n11\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.080\nThat's right.\n\n12\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.940\nIt's a neverending series here on\nloggings and network forensics.\n\n13\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.403\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain is the man we all know and love,\n\n14\n00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:39.553\nthat's Adam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:40.588\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n16\n00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:41.580\nIt's so nice to have you.\n\n17\n00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.506\nI love his answer,\nthat's just a simple wave.\n\n18\n00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:48.418\nAgain, he's going to pantomime\nthis entire episode.\n\n19\n00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:50.335\nSpeak, man.\n\n20\n00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n21\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.110\nlet's get down to business here.\n\n22\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410\nSo we have a part four.\n\n23\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.685\nAnd unusual for us because we\nnormally do part five or part six.\n\n24\n00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna get this done in only\n\n25\n00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:04.880\nfour, make it easier on you.\n\n26\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.627\nBut we're gonna talk a little bit more,\nand as Daniel was saying, there's actually\n\n27\n00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:10.290\nstill some really interesting stuff\nleft to come in this particular area.\n\n28\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.440\nWe have to talk about IDSs and\nIPSs a little bit, what is and what\n\n29\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.475\nare the differences between them, whatever\nthey may be, wherever they may go.\n\n30\n00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:19.925\nWe have to talk about firewalls.\n\n31\n00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:21.945\nWhy are they important,\nwhat do we have to know about them?\n\n32\n00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.015\nWhat about honeypots and/or honeynets, and\n\n33\n00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.115\nhow we deal with those forensically and\ninformation we may find from them.\n\n34\n00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:28.825\nAnd also different kinds\nof network attacks.\n\n35\n00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:32.795\nWhat kind of things are happening that\ntell us that there may be information we\n\n36\n00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:33.795\nhave to pay attention to?\n\n37\n00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:35.272\nSo let's go ahead and let's get started.\n\n38\n00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:37.246\nWhen we talk about IDSs and IPSs,\n\n39\n00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:41.778\nwe talk about intrusion detection\nand/or intrusion prevention systems.\n\n40\n00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:43.320\nDaniel, help me out.\n\n41\n00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I know you're always willing to,\n\n42\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.900\nespecially if I give you lead time and\nsay that,\n\n43\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.988\nthen you can stop doing all\nthe other stuff you're doing.\n\n44\n00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:51.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And actually be focused on me.\n\n45\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.620\nSo now that we've done that,\ngiven Daniel time to prepare.\n\n46\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.270\nLet's talk about IDSs and IPSs.\n\n47\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.387\nIf we had to summarize the difference\nbetween them, just at a high level without\n\n48\n00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:02.529\nreally getting a lot of the detail,\nbut just at a high level.\n\n49\n00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.352\nWhat they do,\nmaybe a main difference between them,\n\n50\n00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:07.120\ntypes of deployments we may see.\n\n51\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.490\nWhat would we tell people,\nwhat are some things they wanna know?\n\n52\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.320\n&gt;&gt; I would say that the biggest\ndifference between a IDS versus an IPS is\n\n53\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.250\nactivity, right?\n\n54\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.240\nOne is mostly reactive and\nthe other is kind of proactive.\n\n55\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720\nOne is basically saying,\n\n56\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.880\nsomething has happened,\nsound the alarm bells, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.460\nIt has a list of those things, or a way\nthat it detects that that has occurred so\n\n58\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.081\nthat it knows to actually\nsound said alarm.\n\n59\n00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:35.660\nThe other, the IPS, the intrusion\nprevention system is actively\n\n60\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.370\ntrying to stop people from getting in.\n\n61\n00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.390\nIt has, again, either a list or\nsome mechanism which allows it to see or\n\n62\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.650\ndetect that something that it does\nnot want to happen is happening, and\n\n63\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.600\nit takes countermeasures to\ntry to stop those things.\n\n64\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.850\nMaybe shutting off a port,\nmaybe throwing up a firewall,\n\n65\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.160\nthings of that nature to end the activity,\nso that it can go no farther.\n\n66\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.557\nSo that's basically, in my estimation,\nis the big difference between the two.\n\n67\n00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and you know,\nDaniel's absolutely right, right?\n\n68\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.320\nSo IDSs are passive monitors,\nthey can alert us.\n\n69\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.720\nAnd people often confuse the idea that\nalerting and telling us, hey, something\n\n70\n00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.500\nwent on, is not the same thing as actually\nresponding and changing a configuration.\n\n71\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.219\nAs Daniel said, maybe modifying a port or\nwhatever, something like that, right?\n\n72\n00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.922\nWhereas an IPS is the IDS capabilities,\n\n73\n00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:26.430\nmonitoring passively, but\nalso active response.\n\n74\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.682\nAnd that's really the key\nadditional criteria.\n\n75\n00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:31.482\nSo wanna make sure that we're aware of\nthat, we understand the difference.\n\n76\n00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:34.788\nWe can speak about different ways\nthese devices have been defined and\n\n77\n00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.330\ntherefore have been deployed.\n\n78\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.700\nNetwork-based, what we call NIDS or NIPS.\n\n79\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.778\nHost-based, HIDS or HIPS.\n\n80\n00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:46.104\nWe even have a wireless configuration\nthought process with regards to IDSs and\n\n81\n00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:47.642\nIPSs, WIDS and WIPS.\n\n82\n00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:51.982\nSo NIDS, HIPS, WIPS, NIDS,\nblah blah blah, this that whatever.\n\n83\n00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.562\nWe got all sorts of stuff going on, right?\n\n84\n00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:57.257\nBut we need to understand as investigators\nthat we may have a host-based\n\n85\n00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:01.820\nsolution running on the machine that has\nbeen compromised that we're looking at.\n\n86\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.259\nA software agent essentially\ninstalled locally,\n\n87\n00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.310\ngathering data on the local machine.\n\n88\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.649\nScanning the data coming and\n\n89\n00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.560\ngoing from that one machine,\nprobably in promiscuous mode.\n\n90\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.300\nWe've talked about that with\nregards to never capturing.\n\n91\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.980\nAnd as a result,\nneed to understand where to look for\n\n92\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.420\ninformation on that system\nthat may be valuable.\n\n93\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.268\nIf we're dealing with a network-based\nconfiguration, we're probably dealing with\n\n94\n00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:25.649\na mirrored port or span port of some kind\nthat we're plugged in to as a device.\n\n95\n00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:28.653\nGathering data across all\nthe ports on that switch,\n\n96\n00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:32.414\nand perhaps across the subnet or\nVLAN or wherever the case may be.\n\n97\n00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:36.175\nAnd as a result we're gonna have to\nlook broader across all those devices\n\n98\n00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.889\nto understand the true impact\nof all the material and\n\n99\n00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.000\nthe data we're seeing in the log files.\n\n100\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.051\nSo it really is very critical for\nus to understand the configuration and\n\n101\n00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:49.994\nthe setup of these devices, right, because\nit gives as the scope, a sense in theory.\n\n102\n00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:54.300\nThe theater of operations and the tactical\ninformation associated with that setup,\n\n103\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.362\nand that ability for us to understand that\nas investigator, helps us to zero in on\n\n104\n00:04:58.362 --> 00:05:02.128\nwhere we need to ultimately be in regards\nto investigating the outcomes and\n\n105\n00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:05.130\nlooking at the data that may\nbe associated with that.\n\n106\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.149\nIf I have a network IDS or network IPS,\n\n107\n00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:10.571\nI'm gonna be able to see data in\nour logs from multiple systems.\n\n108\n00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.348\nIf I have a host-based IDS or\na host-based IPS,\n\n109\n00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:17.346\nI'm only gonna see data that is going\nto represent connectivity to and\n\n110\n00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:20.283\nfrom a single device that\nI am monitoring against.\n\n111\n00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.652\nIn other words where I am and\nI'm gathering logs from.\n\n112\n00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:26.141\nAnd so, I do need to be aware of that,\nI do need to understand that and\n\n113\n00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:29.190\nI do need to have that\nthought process in my mind.\n\n114\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.490\nAre there gonna be or is there gonna\nbe valuable data inside the log files\n\n115\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.610\nin these devices or through these\ndevices captured and centrally managed?\n\n116\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.586\nAbsolutely.\n\n117\n00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:43.578\nWe're gonna get IP addresses, MAC\naddresses, port numbers, we're gonna get\n\n118\n00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:48.200\nusernames, we're gonna get potentially\npasswords or hashes, certainly, of them.\n\n119\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.450\nWe're gonna get traffic, so\n\n120\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.810\nlive raw stream data,\nwhether it's encrypted or not.\n\n121\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.330\nThere's so much information, right,\npotentially that we get in these systems\n\n122\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.060\nand it's incredibly important for\nus to think about investigating them.\n\n123\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.986\nThe challenge for us more often than\nnot is do we have access to them?\n\n124\n00:06:02.986 --> 00:06:06.030\nAnd are we gonna to be able to, again as\nwe've talked about in one of the prior\n\n125\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.360\nepisodes, forensically gather that data,\nforensically gather those logs in a way\n\n126\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.030\nthat we can certify and meet the burden of\nproof with regards to the federal rules of\n\n127\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.630\nevidence to ensure that that data can be\nintroduced as evidence in a court of law?\n\n128\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.120\nThat's really gonna be, probably,\nthe big challenge for us.\n\n129\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.540\nWhat about interpreting\nthe data that's there?\n\n130\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.080\nI don't know about any of you.\n\n131\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.330\nAnd I can't speak for Daniel,\nI can only speak for myself.\n\n132\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.000\nBut while I certainly know a very large\namount about how these systems operate,\n\n133\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.790\nI may not be an expert on any\none vendor's implementation.\n\n134\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.810\nI don't use Splunk very often, even though\nI'm certainly very familiar with it.\n\n135\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.150\nI use Snort very often,\nI'm very familiar with that.\n\n136\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.246\nAnd if I had to gather and\ninterpret log data from FireEye or\n\n137\n00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:51.593\none of these online cloud based systems,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n138\n00:06:51.593 --> 00:06:56.360\nI may not be an expert at understanding\nhow to access the interface,\n\n139\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.480\nhow to do so forensically in a sound way.\n\n140\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.894\nAlthough the data, the raw data itself,\nthe IP address is the IP address, right?\n\n141\n00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:06.510\nRegardless of who captures it it's going\nto be in a form that I can understand.\n\n142\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.170\nHow to get to it, how to forensically\nexamine it, how to draw it out and do so\n\n143\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.420\nin a way that it's gonna be sound\nfrom a collection perspective,\n\n144\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.810\nmay be a challenge for me.\n\n145\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.820\nWhat I'm suggesting is that we have\nto always remember, never forget,\n\n146\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.040\nthat we have to look to partner with\npeople that understand how to do\n\n147\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.370\nthese things properly.\n\n148\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.440\nWe may be able to provide the guidance\non the forensic piece of the puzzle, but\n\n149\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.290\nactually accessing the interfaces,\npulling the levers?\n\n150\n00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.850\nI would much rather sit with a console\noperator that works on that device or that\n\n151\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.408\nsystem everyday, and guide them and tell\nthem what to do to capture the data for\n\n152\n00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.954\nme forensically,\nthan have them tell me what to do, right?\n\n153\n00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:45.564\nBecause I don't know enough about\nthe device that if go to the wrong place,\n\n154\n00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.560\nmake the wrong decision,\nessentially I get one shot at that.\n\n155\n00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.290\nWhereas if I have them do it and\nI say okay at this point\n\n156\n00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.241\nexplain to me what's going to\nhappen before you click on that.\n\n157\n00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:55.607\nThat's where we're going to save the data.\n\n158\n00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:57.187\nOkay so let's stop right there.\n\n159\n00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.128\nLet's make sure this piece is in place.\n\n160\n00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:00.789\nLet's have this right blocker device.\n\n161\n00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:03.341\nAttach, let's make sure\nthe path is correct.\n\n162\n00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:06.110\nLet's test that before we do it,\nto make sure it's good.\n\n163\n00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.114\nNow, that's how we're gonna do that.\n\n164\n00:08:07.114 --> 00:08:09.778\nSo when you go to that screen,\nand you type that path in,\n\n165\n00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:13.154\nmake sure it goes to F drive, and\nwe do what we just discussed, right?\n\n166\n00:08:13.154 --> 00:08:17.274\nI'd rather give them the guidance to\nhave them do it, than have me do it.\n\n167\n00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:18.731\nThe reason for that is two-fold.\n\n168\n00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:24.342\nNumber one, as we've talked about under\nfederal rules of evidence 803, right?\n\n169\n00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:27.811\nThe standard for whether or\nnot we can introduce log files and\n\n170\n00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:31.755\ndata of that type into a court as\nevidence that is seen as being valid,\n\n171\n00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:35.632\nwe have to meet the burden of proof\nthat implies that the custodian or\n\n172\n00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:39.032\nthe operator of the system that\ngathers the evidence does so\n\n173\n00:08:39.032 --> 00:08:43.181\non a regular basis and understands\nthat they can validate and verify that\n\n174\n00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:47.572\nthe mechanisms used are the standard\nmechanisms that they use all the time.\n\n175\n00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:50.866\nIf I take over control and\nI do something in a non-standard way,\n\n176\n00:08:50.866 --> 00:08:54.800\nI may not be able to certify that\nthat evidence was gathered properly.\n\n177\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.780\nWhereas if the architect\nof that system and\n\n178\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.465\nthe operator of that system are doing it\nunder my guidance, and all I'm doing is\n\n179\n00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:04.111\ninserting the forensically sound\nguidance piece, essentially to say okay.\n\n180\n00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:09.116\nAnd by the way, when it came to offloading\nand exporting, Adam interjected and said\n\n181\n00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:14.510\nokay, we've inserted a write-block device,\nand we've saved it off to this path.\n\n182\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.520\nThat was the only step we modified\nfrom our normal process of saving it\n\n183\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.340\nto C drives that we can\naggregate the data.\n\n184\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.790\nThat's perfectly acceptable.\n\n185\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.256\nWe just have to document that.\n\n186\n00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:29.015\nSo it's important to think through\nthe logic of what steps we engage in and\n\n187\n00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:30.037\nwho does what.\n\n188\n00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:34.575\nWhose hand, in other words, literally and\nproverbially is on the lever\n\n189\n00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.906\nwhen we're driving the boat or driving the\ntrain, or whatever you may like, right?\n\n190\n00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:38.672\nWhatever you're driving.\n\n191\n00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:42.912\nBut we have to think about the fact\nthat it's usually that operator\n\n192\n00:09:42.912 --> 00:09:45.202\nwho has to be doing the job\nunder our guidance.\n\n193\n00:09:45.202 --> 00:09:48.783\nAnd this is an important thought,\neven though we may not really stop and\n\n194\n00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:52.261\nconsider from an investigative\nperspective why this is important.\n\n195\n00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.897\nWe have to really cause\nourselves to stop and think.\n\n196\n00:09:54.897 --> 00:09:57.996\nBecause if we don't do this the right\nway we can't go back and do it again.\n\n197\n00:09:57.996 --> 00:09:59.876\nWe've stressed that over and\nover for you and\n\n198\n00:09:59.876 --> 00:10:01.820\nwant to make sure you're\nfamiliar with this.\n\n199\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.068\nSame idea with firewalls right?\n\n200\n00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:03.859\nWhat are firewalls?\n\n201\n00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:05.026\nWhy are they important?\n\n202\n00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:09.046\nThey are border gateway devices\nthat manage traffic flow in and\n\n203\n00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:10.630\nout of an organization.\n\n204\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.040\nThey filter, right?\n\n205\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.914\nThey are able to identify traffic flows.\n\n206\n00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.466\nThey will typically log traffic.\n\n207\n00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:19.440\nThey may block certain kinds\nof traffic allowing others.\n\n208\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.200\nVery important for us to make sure that\nwe are aware of what firewalls operate or\n\n209\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.820\nhow firewalls operate, what firewalls are.\n\n210\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.869\nAre we using how they're programmed, etc?\n\n211\n00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:29.669\nThey all have logs.\n\n212\n00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:31.453\nWe've got to be able to go in and\ngather the logs.\n\n213\n00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:33.640\nAgain, are you an expert on firewalls?\n\n214\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.340\nI don't know, you may or may not be.\n\n215\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.310\nIf you're not you gotta be\ntalking to the people that are.\n\n216\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.278\nIt's gonna be very important, right?\n\n217\n00:10:38.278 --> 00:10:40.090\nSo make sure you're aware of that.\n\n218\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.260\nWhat about honey pots or honey nets?\n\n219\n00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.150\nThe idea of a honey pot, an individual\nmachine set up to lure attackers in.\n\n220\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.590\nLooks good enough but\nthey want to play with it but\n\n221\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.630\nit's not a real machine with real data.\n\n222\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.854\nIt's isolated as essentially a sample\nmachine that we can use to draw them in\n\n223\n00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:57.776\nand see the hacking methodology.\n\n224\n00:10:57.776 --> 00:10:58.344\nSo I can see how they're breaking in.\n\n225\n00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:01.369\n&gt;&gt; Like a Venus Fly Trap\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like that.\n\n226\n00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.617\nI mean Little Shop of Horrors,\nyou've got feed me Seymour going on.\n\n227\n00:11:02.617 --> 00:11:03.776\n&gt;&gt; Looks good.\n\n228\n00:11:03.776 --> 00:11:05.640\nThe little bug says!\n\n229\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.764\nThere's a nice pitcher of water.\n\n230\n00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:10.650\nLet me climb down under that plan and\nthen snap, we've got you, you're in there.\n\n231\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.320\n&gt;&gt; And you're there.\n\n232\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.669\nSo it's a crucible,\nmaybe a good way of thinking about it.\n\n233\n00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:13.443\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n234\n00:11:13.443 --> 00:11:15.640\n&gt;&gt; We could investigate what's going on.\n\n235\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.255\nWe can look at the hacky methodology, the\ntechniques, the operational things that\n\n236\n00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:24.353\nare going on, how a hacker's getting in,\nwhat exploits they're using.\n\n237\n00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:28.326\nSo this is what we would do to trap\nDaniel's shell code in his exploit\n\n238\n00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.030\nand see it.\n\n239\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.284\nIt would activate and he would imagine and\nthink if we did our job the right way,\n\n240\n00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:34.958\nhey I was able to get in to that\nmachine and did your work, right?\n\n241\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:38.554\nYou broke in but the reality is that\nmachine's isolated in a memory bubble\n\n242\n00:11:38.554 --> 00:11:40.237\nsitting in what we call a sandbox.\n\n243\n00:11:40.237 --> 00:11:42.055\nSo it's not gonna connect to anything.\n\n244\n00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:44.600\nIt's got some data looks like\nmaybe a real machine but\n\n245\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.440\nin reality it's just sample data\nthat won't affect anything.\n\n246\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.629\nBut by doing that we've tricked Daniel\ninto giving up his secrets, right?\n\n247\n00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:53.790\nHe's shown us, hey,\nthis is what I'm gonna do.\n\n248\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.878\nThis is the exploit.\n\n249\n00:11:54.878 --> 00:11:56.872\nAnd as a result, when we see it for real,\n\n250\n00:11:56.872 --> 00:12:00.058\nin the real world in the wild we're\nnow gonna know it was Daniel.\n\n251\n00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:02.587\nWe know what the code looks like and\nwe know what to look for\n\n252\n00:12:02.587 --> 00:12:06.010\nforensically to examine the machine and\nlook for evidence of that.\n\n253\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.512\nSo it's important for\nus to understand the value of honey pots.\n\n254\n00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:12.885\nHoney nets are simply multiple honey pot\nmachines linked together in a network\n\n255\n00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:13.820\nthat we can use.\n\n256\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.955\nFor awhile,\nthese kind of fell out of favor.\n\n257\n00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:19.590\nThere were some ethical or\nmoral dilemmas about using them.\n\n258\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.333\nThere was a question of\nenticement versus entrapment.\n\n259\n00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:25.573\nWas it legal to actually use\nthese devices and if so,\n\n260\n00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:28.816\nwere we stepping over the boundary and\nmaybe perhaps\n\n261\n00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:33.470\ntricking people into doing things\nillegally they wouldn't normally do.\n\n262\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.252\nThere really is no longer a concern\nabout this kind of stuff.\n\n263\n00:12:36.252 --> 00:12:39.817\nWe've pretty much validated that\nit's gonna be okay to do this.\n\n264\n00:12:39.817 --> 00:12:41.496\nAnd as a result they're making a comeback.\n\n265\n00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:45.850\nHoneynet.org, right, would be one of the\nwebsites you may wanna go take a look at.\n\n266\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.590\nOr I think if you could just Google for\nme really quickly.\n\n267\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.110\nI think it's the Honey Net Project.\n\n268\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.528\nI think it's honeynet.org.\n\n269\n00:12:51.528 --> 00:12:55.917\nBut Honey Net Project is kinda the lead\nentity in the website that you\n\n270\n00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:57.467\nwanna look at for this.\n\n271\n00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:58.732\n&gt;&gt; Honeynet.org.\n&gt;&gt; It's the honey nut project, so\n\n272\n00:12:58.732 --> 00:12:59.628\nit's the honeynut.org, right?\n\n273\n00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:00.916\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It's honeynet.org.\n\n274\n00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:01.909\nYou can take a look out at that.\n\n275\n00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:03.572\nDaniel'll throw that in the show notes for\nus.\n\n276\n00:13:03.572 --> 00:13:05.398\nJust make sure he's captured that URL,\n\n277\n00:13:05.398 --> 00:13:08.842\nwith regards to this because I forgot to\nput that in when I wrote the notes up.\n\n278\n00:13:08.842 --> 00:13:10.970\nI just have a line that says,\nhey, honey pots and honey nets.\n\n279\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.082\nI forgot to put the URL there.\n\n280\n00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:14.371\nSo, just make sure you know to go out and\ntake a look.\n\n281\n00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:16.510\nYou can read up on the methodology.\n\n282\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.517\nThese days a lot of this, as I said,\nis done with virtual machines.\n\n283\n00:13:19.517 --> 00:13:23.650\nSo it's much easier to create these\nsystems today than it may have been in\n\n284\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.225\ndays gone by, if you will.\n\n285\n00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.110\nLet's talk about network attacks, types of\nnetwork attacks, for a couple of minutes.\n\n286\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.184\nSo what's you most favorite\nkind of network attack?\n\n287\n00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.008\nDon't tell me show code by the way.\n\n288\n00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:31.648\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, well.\n\n289\n00:13:31.648 --> 00:13:33.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's your most favorite?\n\n290\n00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:39.333\n&gt;&gt; I love RFIs cuz they're just so\ndang easy to do a remote file inclusion.\n\n291\n00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:44.208\nYou just point to yourself and say,\ndownload this malicious code and run it so\n\n292\n00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:46.530\nthat I might have access please.\n\n293\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n294\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.179\nSo setting up some sort of either shell or\nbackdoor ,somehow rooting the system,\n\n295\n00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:55.287\nwhatever you call it, there's a lot of\ndifferent ways, we would approach that.\n\n296\n00:13:55.287 --> 00:13:56.387\nBut some sorta code exploit, right?\n\n297\n00:13:56.387 --> 00:13:58.412\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So you're thinking about using code,\n\n298\n00:13:58.412 --> 00:14:00.227\nexploiting or using the code to exploit.\n\n299\n00:14:00.227 --> 00:14:02.601\n&gt;&gt; Buffer overflows are fun.\n&gt;&gt; Buffer overflow's definitely on\n\n300\n00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:03.211\nthe list.\n\n301\n00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:06.040\nWe're gonna take a look at a document\nthat helps us to understand those.\n\n302\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.270\nThings like IP address spoofing,\nright, would be important.\n\n303\n00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.281\nWe talked about the simple but effective.\n\n304\n00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:13.685\nI don't need to kill myself and\nturn myself inside out as a hacker if I\n\n305\n00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:17.866\ncan just do something simple and make you\npretend to be something that's important\n\n306\n00:14:17.866 --> 00:14:20.880\nto you and make you feel as if\nthat's what you're getting.\n\n307\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.620\nSo if I can masquerade or hide as\nsomebody, then it may be simple enough.\n\n308\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.840\nHow about man-in-the-middle attacks,\nMITM attacks, man in the middle.\n\n309\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.920\nLittle relay of information,\nmaybe manipulating or\n\n310\n00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.200\nmodifying or just passively scanning and\n\n311\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.800\nlistening to that information to\nseek advantage at some point later.\n\n312\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.368\nSniffing, right?\n\n313\n00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:40.816\nSo active or passive,\nanother way of thinking about that.\n\n314\n00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:44.610\nGood old-fashioned denial, and\ndistributed denial of service attacks,\n\n315\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.565\nDOS and/or DDoS.\n\n316\n00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:48.368\nYou mentioned buffer overflows,\ninjection attacks,\n\n317\n00:14:48.368 --> 00:14:50.630\nanother big on on the list there as well.\n\n318\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.945\nWant to be thinking about injection\nattacks and Daniel was describing one or\n\n319\n00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:56.136\nmore types of injection\nattacks as he mentioned.\n\n320\n00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:59.527\nBut there's a lot of different\nones we can engage in when\n\n321\n00:14:59.527 --> 00:15:02.440\nwe're looking at log files specifically.\n\n322\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.550\nThings like new line, character\nreturns in the logs can be manipulated\n\n323\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.984\nto our advantage if we're\nan attacker to screw up the logs.\n\n324\n00:15:09.984 --> 00:15:12.160\nWe call this new line injection attacks.\n\n325\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.140\nSeparator attacks,\nwe can use separator characters so\n\n326\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.840\npipes and\nthings like that can be used in the log.\n\n327\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.157\nWe may actually again be\nable to manipulate that,\n\n328\n00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:22.140\ncalled a separator injection attacks.\n\n329\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.842\nHow about time stamp attacks where\nwe're manipulating the time, and\n\n330\n00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:27.474\nthe time stamping, we've talked\nabout this a little bit with NTP.\n\n331\n00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:29.020\nHTML tagging attacks.\n\n332\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.067\nThey're call HTML tag injection attacks.\n\n333\n00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:35.750\nIf we insert HTML tags into the logs,\nagain we may screw up the way they render.\n\n334\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.710\nAnd this is really the idea of,\nwell, if we have a web interface, and\n\n335\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.880\nwe render the data incorrectly,\nthen, maybe,\n\n336\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.900\nthe logs are valueless, cuz then you\ncan't really understand what they are.\n\n337\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.960\nWe can recover from these,\ntraditionally, right?\n\n338\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.086\nWe take the raw data, we can then set it\nup, and interpret them a different way,\n\n339\n00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:51.390\noff line so we can see it.\n\n340\n00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.023\nBut the idea is that we may be able to,\nas a bad actor, as an attacker,\n\n341\n00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:59.058\nattack the system in real time and\nscrew up and manipulate the data capture.\n\n342\n00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.438\nAnd so\nthere are a series of injection attacks.\n\n343\n00:16:01.438 --> 00:16:05.361\nNot, by the way, the traditional ones that\nDaniel was describing that he was thinking\n\n344\n00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.328\nabout with code, but\n\n345\n00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:09.760\na series of attacks specific to logs\nfrom the injection perspective.\n\n346\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.320\nThat, as an investigator, we may wanna\nthink about in addition to the kind of\n\n347\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.485\nattacks that Daniel described, which\nare the more traditional injection and\n\n348\n00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:20.265\nbuffer overflow attacks\nthat we often think about.\n\n349\n00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:21.635\nSo, just some stuff to consider.\n\n350\n00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:23.425\n&gt;&gt; A really fun one that's interesting.\n\n351\n00:16:23.425 --> 00:16:28.147\nA good way to get your code into\na machine is through the error logs.\n\n352\n00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:29.895\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And use the logs themselves, right?\n\n353\n00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:34.940\nGenerate the error, it's gonna flag\na log into wherever the logs are kept.\n\n354\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.304\nAnd if you input a lot of systems or\ntry to log in.\n\n355\n00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:44.090\nYeah, you can use HTTP requests and\njust throw your code in there.\n\n356\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.230\nAnd now I know that's on there,\n\n357\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.670\nI can use a vulnerability to use that\ncode and gain access to the system.\n\n358\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.270\nAnd it's right there along, so\nas a CHFI, as I go through,\n\n359\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.520\nI'm gonna go and look, [LAUGH] somebody\nhas used the vulnerability on your machine\n\n360\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.370\nto add code into your log files and\nuse that to exploit it.\n\n361\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:06.120\nSo, obviously we got the logs,\ncan be used for both good and evil.\n\n362\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I prefer to use them for\nevil myself.\n\n363\n00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:09.693\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to do my evil little laugh and\n\n364\n00:17:09.693 --> 00:17:10.766\ndo the-\n&gt;&gt; The hand roll.\n\n365\n00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:13.390\n&gt;&gt; The hand roll,\nthe evil laugh with the raised eyebrow.\n\n366\n00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:18.390\nI saw this last night which\nis why I remembered it.\n\n367\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.547\nSo here we often will talk\nabout random TV show asides and\n\n368\n00:17:21.547 --> 00:17:24.107\nthe Big Bang Theory's\nalways a popular one.\n\n369\n00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:28.975\nI don't know if you saw the Big Bang\nepisode, again, referencing another one,\n\n370\n00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:31.983\nbut the one where Koothrappali,\nright, so Raj,\n\n371\n00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:36.080\nthe character, gets tagged as\nbeing one of the top 30 under 30.\n\n372\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.550\nSo he identifies a planetary body, and\n\n373\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.500\nPeople Magazine says,\nyou're one of the bright, upcoming stars.\n\n374\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.280\nAnd Sheldon has no point of reference for\nthis.\n\n375\n00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.260\nHe's like, well,\nwhat's the scientific basis?\n\n376\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.460\nWhat did you do that's so\nimportant compared to all the work I do?\n\n377\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.248\nAnd he's going on and on and\nhe makes him feel horrible.\n\n378\n00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:54.270\nAnd so, then the whole episode's\nabout how this unwinds and\n\n379\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.260\nhow it goes kinda off the rails for him.\n\n380\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.730\nBut at one point, they get together.\n\n381\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.960\nLeonard and Howard, and say to Shelton,\nhey, look we've gotta go apologize, right?\n\n382\n00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.240\nBecause you really made him feel horrible.\n\n383\n00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.320\nIt's like a big deal.\n\n384\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.420\nWe gotta go say we're sorry.\n\n385\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.750\nSo they convince Sheldon to go do this,\nbut\n\n386\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.650\nthey have to explain the idea behind it,\nthe social construct.\n\n387\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.570\nAnd they say, okay,\nyou gotta smile, right,\n\n388\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.250\nto kinda indicate that you're happy.\n\n389\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.652\nSo he gives one of those wicked, it's so\nclassic if you've seen the episode or\n\n390\n00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:23.934\nseen it-\n&gt;&gt; I can imagine it right now.\n\n391\n00:18:23.934 --> 00:18:26.732\n&gt;&gt; He gives the smile like\nthis crazy the Riddler smile,\n\n392\n00:18:26.732 --> 00:18:29.210\nlike the Riddler's gonna go kill Batman.\n\n393\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.310\nExactly like that.\n\n394\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.530\nDo that again, and focus, like that.\n\n395\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.730\nAnd so he does that, and\nthe line is like, Howard says, my God,\n\n396\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.530\nthat's so effing scary.\n\n397\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.750\nAnd it's like,\nwe're not going to kill Batman, right,\n\n398\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.300\nwe're just showing up to smile.\n\n399\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.303\nSo that he does one of these,\none of these.\n\n400\n00:18:44.303 --> 00:18:46.660\nAnd that's the smile he does\nthroughout the episode now.\n\n401\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.440\nAnd so it's just crazy.\n\n402\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.608\nAnd it has absolutely no bearing\non anything we're talking about.\n\n403\n00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:53.130\nSo you could've taken and\ntimeout and gone and\n\n404\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.920\ngotten coffee while I've been\ngoing on on this rant and rave.\n\n405\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.167\nBut the idea behind it is that\nwhat we wannna understand, and\n\n406\n00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:01.723\nDaniel's point is a really,\nreally good one.\n\n407\n00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:05.563\nIs that your log files, while we often\nthink about them as investigators and\n\n408\n00:19:05.563 --> 00:19:07.850\nsay, we gotta get the data out of there.\n\n409\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.615\nOne of the things that we\ndon't often realize and\n\n410\n00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:13.525\nthink about is the fact\nthat the log contains data.\n\n411\n00:19:13.525 --> 00:19:14.645\nWe get it, we know it.\n\n412\n00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:15.322\nI'm not saying we don't.\n\n413\n00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.405\nBut my point is and Daniel's point is,\nhey, if it has data in it,\n\n414\n00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:21.472\ncan't we put bad data in there\ninstead of just good data?\n\n415\n00:19:21.472 --> 00:19:22.948\nAnd the answer is absolutely.\n\n416\n00:19:22.948 --> 00:19:27.110\nAnd if we sneak the bad data in, and\nthe system is interpreting that data and\n\n417\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:30.017\nexecuting the log file,\nplaying it back to show us,\n\n418\n00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:33.602\nwon't the bad data get executed\nalong with the good data?\n\n419\n00:19:33.602 --> 00:19:36.872\nAnd potentially, won't that exploit\ncode get executed to this part of that?\n\n420\n00:19:36.872 --> 00:19:39.614\nAnd that's essentially,\nwithout going to all the bloody,\n\n421\n00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:42.745\ngory details of how it happens,\nthat's what Daniel's hinting at.\n\n422\n00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:45.120\nAnd that's one of the ways that\nwe can compromise a system.\n\n423\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.933\nAnd that's why we not only have to\ncapture this data, but we have to be so\n\n424\n00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:53.480\ncareful about executing it offline on\na separate system away from the original.\n\n425\n00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.740\nBecause if there is bad data,\nessentially a landmine, a booby trap,\n\n426\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.420\nsitting there waiting for us,\n\n427\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.350\nit's much better to blow up an isolated\nmachine that could be recovered and\n\n428\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.160\nreset than it is to blow up the original\nwhere all the evidence is and it's gone.\n\n429\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.879\nAnd this is not unusual, by the way.\n\n430\n00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:12.176\nThis is something that bad actors will\ndo on purpose, will leave landmines,\n\n431\n00:20:12.176 --> 00:20:16.887\nun-exploded booby traps in systems for\nus to trip across as we're investigating.\n\n432\n00:20:16.887 --> 00:20:20.218\nAnd if we're not careful, we may actually\nblow the system up in the process of\n\n433\n00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:23.652\ntrying to investigate it, which of course\ncan both be a challenge forensically\n\n434\n00:20:23.652 --> 00:20:27.510\n[LAUGH] but also could potentially be\na bad thing if we wanna display evidence.\n\n435\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.916\nSo speaking of injection attacks,\nbuffer overflows,\n\n436\n00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:33.040\nthings like that, thought it would be good\nto round out our conversation in this area\n\n437\n00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.330\nby showing you some really\ngood reference material for\n\n438\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.370\nhow to better understand these exploits,\nhow they operate.\n\n439\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.080\nAgain, a little bit beyond\nthe conversation we're having here with\n\n440\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.770\nregards to, hey,\nare you aware of buffer overflows?\n\n441\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.470\nDo you understand injection attacks?\n\n442\n00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.960\nWe do a really good set of episodes and\ncoverage on this stuff in the CEH set\n\n443\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.450\nof shows that I've done,\nin the CISSB shows that I've done.\n\n444\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.811\nWe take a look at this stuff.\n\n445\n00:20:56.811 --> 00:21:00.489\nI think we talked a little bit about it in\nthe Cloud, the CCSB conversations you and\n\n446\n00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:01.884\nI had around that credential.\n\n447\n00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:03.493\nWe talked about the OWASP Top Ten.\n\n448\n00:21:03.493 --> 00:21:05.628\nWe encourage you to go take a look\nat some of those issues and\n\n449\n00:21:05.628 --> 00:21:06.750\nsee more about it there.\n\n450\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.083\nBut at least wanna give you the point\nof reference and the material for it.\n\n451\n00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:11.202\nSo if we can go take a look real quick,\nright here,\n\n452\n00:21:11.202 --> 00:21:12.770\nI did while I was lounging by the way.\n\n453\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was cool.\n\n454\n00:21:13.395 --> 00:21:15.737\nI didn't even to move,\nall I had to do was this.\n\n455\n00:21:15.737 --> 00:21:18.411\nThat's awesome,\nI love it when that kinda stuff happens.\n\n456\n00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:19.435\n&gt;&gt; Behold the power.\n\n457\n00:21:19.435 --> 00:21:21.614\n&gt;&gt; Behold the power of the pointer and\nthe finger.\n\n458\n00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.994\nSo what we're at here is\nthe OWASP Top Ten project list.\n\n459\n00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.956\nOWASP, Open-Web Application\nSecurity Project,\n\n460\n00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:32.857\nis going to give us a wealth of\ninformation with regards to security,\n\n461\n00:21:32.857 --> 00:21:37.630\nsecurity research, security vulnerability\nassessments, all sorts of stuff.\n\n462\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.060\nGreat site for you as a forensic\ninvestigator to be checking out.\n\n463\n00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.830\nGreat site for you as a security\nprofessional to be checking out.\n\n464\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.160\nLots of good stuff in there\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n465\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.990\nThe Top Ten Project lists the top\nten web application vulnerabilities.\n\n466\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.610\nThey have a lot of top ten projects,\nthis one's specific to the web.\n\n467\n00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.437\nSo when you go and you click on the PDF,\ncan we go full screen so\n\n468\n00:21:57.437 --> 00:21:58.390\nyou could see that?\n\n469\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.840\nWhen you click on the link for the PDF\nright over here, you're gonna see it.\n\n470\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.040\nI'm gonna bring it up for you in a second.\n\n471\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.427\nNow just quickly,\nbefore we get out of this screen,\n\n472\n00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:10.971\nlet me explain why it says 2013 and\nwe're sitting here in late 2016.\n\n473\n00:22:10.971 --> 00:22:13.440\nYou may be viewing this in 2017 and\nbeyond.\n\n474\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.940\nEvery three years this list is updated.\n\n475\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.630\nSo we're shooting this,\nyou could see the screen date right there,\n\n476\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.010\nwe're shooting this right\ntowards the end of 2016 and so\n\n477\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.470\nwhat you can see is that this\nis actually still the 2013 list.\n\n478\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.850\nBut interestingly, this list is about\nto be updated going into Q1 of 2017,\n\n479\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.780\nthe new list has actually\nbeen compiled already.\n\n480\n00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.150\nThe research is done from June through I\nthink October of the three year cycle.\n\n481\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.520\nSo at the end of the three years,\nin 2016 this year, in June OWASP opened up\n\n482\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.330\na comment period, said, hey, we need all\nthe information from everybody out there.\n\n483\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:52.160\nThey compiled all the results,\nstopped that around mid to late October.\n\n484\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.282\nThey're compiling the data as we speak.\n\n485\n00:22:54.282 --> 00:22:56.441\nIt will be released in Q1 of 2017.\n\n486\n00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:58.156\nSo by the time you go to look at this,\n\n487\n00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:01.480\nit's quite possible you will be\nlooking at this going to this link and\n\n488\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.570\nactually seeing the updated\n2016 version of the list.\n\n489\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.100\nSo it may look a little different than\nwhat we're about to show you, but\n\n490\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.630\nthe idea is still the same.\n\n491\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.210\nThe list doesn't vary that much.\n\n492\n00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.310\nAnd so when we go in and we take a look,\nwhat we're going to see is the following.\n\n493\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.150\nLet me just click on\nthere to bring that up.\n\n494\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.640\nOne second, I thought I had it open,\nbut apparently not.\n\n495\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.570\nThere we go.\n\n496\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.370\nSo what we can see is the Top 10 PDF.\n\n497\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.730\nNow the reason I like this and\nI think it's important for\n\n498\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.670\nyou as an investigator to be\naware of it is the following.\n\n499\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.901\nIt does have the cool little wasp\non there, that's always cool.\n\n500\n00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:34.757\nBut in addition to that,\nwhat I like about the document and\n\n501\n00:23:34.757 --> 00:23:36.900\nthe way they set it up is the following.\n\n502\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.530\nThey do give us a look back at the prior\nyears' lists, so at the 2010 versus\n\n503\n00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:45.892\n2013 list we could see that injection\nstill heads the top of the list.\n\n504\n00:23:45.892 --> 00:23:49.609\nIt's one of the most common forms\nof security concerns we have.\n\n505\n00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:51.271\nNow, there's been a little shift more or\nless but\n\n506\n00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:52.640\nyou could see the majority of it there.\n\n507\n00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.993\nCross-site scripting still on the list,\nbroken authentication and\n\n508\n00:23:55.993 --> 00:24:00.370\nsession management, insecure direct object\nreference, cross-site request forgery,\n\n509\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:00.959\net cetera.\n\n510\n00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:01.607\nAll of these things.\n\n511\n00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:03.649\nThey may move around a little bit\nin order but they're all there.\n\n512\n00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:04.459\nBut in addition,\n\n513\n00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:08.028\nwhat you'll see is that we're gonna go\nin We're gonna take a look right here.\n\n514\n00:24:08.028 --> 00:24:09.949\nWe have our top 10 list.\n\n515\n00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:11.764\nWe're not going to be\nable to see all 10 items,\n\n516\n00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:13.550\nbut zoom in and show you a couple of them.\n\n517\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.830\nIt gives you a nice little one or\ntwo sentence summary of each flaw.\n\n518\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.450\nSo you definitely wanna go to take a look.\n\n519\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.430\nAnd then the part that I really like,\nwhich I think is great, but for\n\n520\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.480\ninvestigators and for\n\n521\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.860\nsecurity professionals that are just\nstarting to learn about this stuff right?\n\n522\n00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.659\nWe get a nice page overview\non each one of these.\n\n523\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.660\nWe get a little reference to what it is,\nso application specific, how does it work?\n\n524\n00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.720\nWho is the thread agent?\n\n525\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.770\nWho is the bad actor?\n\n526\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.960\nWe get the attack vector\nwith the color code, so\n\n527\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.030\nit's very easy attack to exploit,\nbut it's very damaging.\n\n528\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.470\nIt tells us the security weaknesses,\n\n529\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.320\nhow prevalent, how common, the impacts\nof the year and the business impact.\n\n530\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.030\nIn addition, it shows us whether or\nnot you're vulnerable to this and\n\n531\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.870\nit shows us, as you can see,\nam I vulnerable?\n\n532\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.670\nGives us a little bit of some example\nattack scenarios, some reference material\n\n533\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.936\nto help us out with that, and\nalso how do you prevent them.\n\n534\n00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:08.740\nThey do serve as one of the top ten items,\nalmost like a manual, a guide here,\n\n535\n00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.480\nif you will, that helps us to understand\nhow to prevent these kind of things and\n\n536\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.910\nhow to stop these kind of\nattacks from happening.\n\n537\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.730\nSo it's a very important\nreference document for us.\n\n538\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.600\nOne that you should\ndefinitely take a look at.\n\n539\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.290\nAs a forensic investigator remember, we're\nnot on the front lines preventing these\n\n540\n00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.160\nattacks, we're on the back end\nafter they happen, examining them.\n\n541\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.760\nBut it's never a bad idea for\nus to have enough knowledge,\n\n542\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.750\nto be able to talk to as I've\nindicated in several areas,\n\n543\n00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.110\ntalk to the front line people that\nare actually managing the systems and\n\n544\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.810\nask whether or not we are defending\nagainst these attacks.\n\n545\n00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.500\nAnd if we are, to what degree, so\nthat we understand what kind of\n\n546\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.120\nexpectations we should have so that,\nwhen we're called in to do investigation,\n\n547\n00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.510\nwe don't have to put all the pieces\nback together from scratch.\n\n548\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.490\nBut, rather,\nwe can start with some knowledge and say,\n\n549\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.600\nokay, well we should have prevented\nthis kind of buffer overflow.\n\n550\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.070\nLet's check and make sure we did,\nif we did, it's not that, but\n\n551\n00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.870\nif we didn't, let's find out why,\nbecause we were told we should be.\n\n552\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.350\nAnd as a result,\nmaybe something's been modified.\n\n553\n00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.780\nMaybe a hacker got in.\n\n554\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.000\nMaybe Daniel got his\nexploit code in there and\n\n555\n00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.190\nthrew a manipulation of\nbad data in the error log.\n\n556\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.260\nActually was able to\nexploit the system and\n\n557\n00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.980\nbecause of that, something\nhappened that we're not aware of.\n\n558\n00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.630\nThe defenders were thinking,\nhey, yeah you know what?\n\n559\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.490\nWe should be stopping these attacks.\n\n560\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.050\nBut guess what?\n\n561\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.820\nMaybe we're not and we just don't know.\n\n562\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.470\nSo it's really good for us to have\nknowledge of this kind of stuff.\n\n563\n00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.170\nBe aware of this kind of stuff and\nunderstand what's happened.\n\n564\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.080\nThe more you read about, the more\nyou understand, the more you know.\n\n565\n00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.170\nAs an investigator,\n\n566\n00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.470\nthe more likely are gonna be able\nto not only stop potentially.\n\n567\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.890\nThese attacks from occurring by working\nwith the teams that are investigating and\n\n568\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.160\nmanipulating and understanding how\nto set up and manage systems, but\n\n569\n00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.580\nalso on the back end when you have to\nactually work with them after the fact.\n\n570\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.530\nYou're gonna be able to get out of the\ngate quicker, you're much more likely to\n\n571\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.275\nbe successful at figuring out what\nthe actual attack was and as a result\n\n572\n00:26:52.275 --> 00:26:57.280\n,you're gonna be able to answer\nthe key question, how did it happen?\n\n573\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.370\nWhen, where, why, all the questions,\nwho, what, when, where, why, and how?\n\n574\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.660\nThe five Ws and the H.\n\n575\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.200\nBut most importantly, you're gonna be\nable to give authoritative details,\n\n576\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.300\nauthoritative interpretation\nof data to the system owner,\n\n577\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.100\nwhoever that is, whoever's asked you that.\n\n578\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.810\nCome in and\nessentially helped them to understand.\n\n579\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.260\nSo, it is very important, and\n\n580\n00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.530\nit's something you definitely\nwant to think about and focus on.\n\n581\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, log capturing,\nnetwork forensics,\n\n582\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.210\nsomething that you can't push to the side.\n\n583\n00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.216\nYou can't think, well, that's not\nsomething I have to worry about.\n\n584\n00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:27.208\nIt's definitely a great place\nto focus in and take your time,\n\n585\n00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:31.005\nunderstand each one of the concepts,\nunderstand what system am I working on,\n\n586\n00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:33.593\nhow does it store logs,\nwhere are those logs stored,\n\n587\n00:27:33.593 --> 00:27:36.434\nwhat should I be expecting to\nsee when I look at those logs?\n\n588\n00:27:36.434 --> 00:27:41.203\nAnd then, of course, what types of network\nattacks might be available out there for\n\n589\n00:27:41.203 --> 00:27:43.487\nthe system that you are investigating,\n\n590\n00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:47.675\nso that you might find the most likely\ninroad that the attacker has taken.\n\n591\n00:27:47.675 --> 00:27:49.665\nAnd therefore leads you down their path.\n\n592\n00:27:49.665 --> 00:27:51.975\nFollow their breadcrumbs, as you were.\n\n593\n00:27:51.975 --> 00:27:55.060\nAnd figure out who they were,\nso that you can find them.\n\n594\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.530\nBring them to justice, and sit them\nunder the jail for what they've done.\n\n595\n00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like\nthe Justice League of America.\n\n596\n00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's the truth, justice.\n\n597\n00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.735\n&gt;&gt; Feel like the flag should be waving,\nand we should be saluting or something.\n\n598\n00:28:04.735 --> 00:28:06.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n599\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, that brings us to\nthe end of this great episode,\n\n600\n00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.120\nhopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n601\n00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.286\nI know I had a lot of fun on this one.\n\n602\n00:28:11.286 --> 00:28:11.793\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was a good one.\n\n603\n00:28:11.793 --> 00:28:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Adam we, thank you for dropping by.\n\n604\n00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt;

everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:16.895\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:18.175\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:22.145\nAnd in today's episode, we are back for\nmore on our CHFI series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:24.975\nAnd joining me in the studio again,\nyou know him, you love him,\n\n11\n00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.780\nour good friend mister Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.170\nAdam welcome back sir and\nhow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nCan I put on the wireless router.\n\n14\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.170\nI wanted to wear this cuz I thought\nthis would be such a cool way,\n\n15\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.100\nlet me see if I can, let me get over here,\nkind of center, right.\n\n16\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.430\nThis would be, there we go perfect.\n\n17\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.440\nIt's like matching appliance.\n\n18\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.600\nThis would be such a cool way\nto start talking about wireless.\n\n19\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000\nLook at me.\n&gt;&gt; It's beautiful.\n\n20\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.520\n&gt;&gt; Wireless router.\n\n21\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.100\nI'm a tea pot.\n\n22\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.950\n&gt;&gt; Starting a new trend.\n\n23\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of like a wireless router.\n\n24\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.465\nHere you do it, it's so\nmuch fun, you should do it.\n\n25\n00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.290\n[LAUGH] But you're so much taller.\n\n26\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.340\n&gt;&gt; Come on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.400\n&gt;&gt; You made me look like.\n\n28\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.020\nThere you go.\n\n29\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.400\nOkay wait so you can see that shot.\n\n30\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.380\nSee we're gonna start like a fad now,\n\n31\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.280\neverybody's going to want\na wireless router hat.\n\n32\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.894\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nA beautiful wireless router hat.\n\n33\n00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:04.809\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You too can be as cool as we are.\n\n34\n00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.587\nPlease don't try this at home.\n\n35\n00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:09.250\nWe are going to talk about wireless and\n\n36\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.830\na little bit of forensics\nwith regards to wireless.\n\n37\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.080\nAnd the reason that we had our\nfestive wireless headwear on today.\n\n38\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.340\nIs that wireless starts and\n\n39\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.430\nends at the wireless access\npoint of the device, right?\n\n40\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.580\nAnd a lot of times when we talk about\nthis, what we often forget about,\n\n41\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.390\nas investigators, is wireless doesn't\nreally mean wireless all the way through.\n\n42\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.640\nA lot of times, I don't know, Daniel,\nif you find this when you talk to people,\n\n43\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.230\nbut a lot of times when you talk to people\nabout wireless, can you flip that up for\n\n44\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.900\nme just while we're talking?\n\n45\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.270\nI want to show them the back\nof this thing for a second.\n\n46\n00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.480\nI know that, I'm sure all of you out there\nrealize this but when we think about\n\n47\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.710\nwireless we often say okay great,\nyeah we're connected wirelessly.\n\n48\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.510\nYou know my laptop no wires, my mobile\ndevice no wires I can go anywhere,\n\n49\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.560\nI can do anything.\n\n50\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.630\nThat part's all true.\n\n51\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.680\nThat's the half of the equation\nthat you guys control.\n\n52\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.650\nBut then on the backend when\nwe get to the access point,\n\n53\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.010\nwe get to the device, there is a wire.\n\n54\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.880\nWe always have to cable up to something,\nsomewhere, somehow, someway.\n\n55\n00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.970\nThere's a tie in back to\nthe infrastructure that runs behind\n\n56\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.710\nthe scenes.\n\n57\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.610\nNow it may not be through\nthat access point,\n\n58\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.710\nit may be chained to another access point.\n\n59\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.160\nBut eventually you're gonna get to\n\n60\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.540\na wire that runs out of the back\nof a wireless access devices.\n\n61\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.960\nWhatever it is, wireless router, wireless\naccess point, all these different things.\n\n62\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd there's gonna be an antenna on\nthe back of that thing that accepts\n\n63\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.020\nincoming signals.\n\n64\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.780\nAnd some translation that goes on inside.\n\n65\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.990\nAnd a cable that takes you\nout to the outside world.\n\n66\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.600\nCan we just quickly do the,\nyeah, there you go, exactly.\n\n67\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.970\nNow if you turn sideways,\nput on your ITPro 3D glasses,\n\n68\n00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.870\nyou'll be able to see this come to life,\nright?\n\n69\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.670\nSo can you do a little pointing here\nbecause I am backwards and upside down.\n\n70\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.620\nSo show me where the WAN\nport would typically be.\n\n71\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170\nSo you know color coding\nnot withstanding right?\n\n72\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.760\nWe usually have a single port\nthat's going to be the WAN port.\n\n73\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.945\nSo that's It's going to connect\nus to the outside world.\n\n74\n00:02:57.945 --> 00:02:58.955\nThank you Vanna.\n\n75\n00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:02.375\nAnd then our LAN ports will\ntypically be grouped together.\n\n76\n00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:06.325\nSo again, color coding not withstanding,\nusually going to be three of them,\n\n77\n00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.235\nfour of them, however many there\nare on the back of the device.\n\n78\n00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:09.255\nJust depends.\n\n79\n00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:13.912\nSo you'll see those, we may have a USB\nport sometimes we can upload firmware make\n\n80\n00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:16.002\nchanges stuff wherever case maybe.\n\n81\n00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:17.661\nI know it's kind of hard to see but\n\n82\n00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:20.519\nI can just make it up there is\npower port there typically.\n\n83\n00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.577\nAnd then between the power port and\nUSB port,\n\n84\n00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.245\nwe typically have I think\nyou're pointing to it, right?\n\n85\n00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:29.580\nA little hole there that typically can be\nused for reset of the device cuz you know\n\n86\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.996\nsometimes things being what they are,\nthings don't always work the right way.\n\n87\n00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.346\nAnd you know you may have\nto reset it on occasion.\n\n88\n00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:40.851\nAnd then we have these porcupine looking\nthings that are sticking out the back side\n\n89\n00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:43.605\nhere and\nthese are going to be our antennas right.\n\n90\n00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:49.164\nAnd so what I was going to do was actually\njust unscrew one while we're talking and\n\n91\n00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:53.443\nso we're going to have antennas\nthat are going to connect up.\n\n92\n00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:56.071\nAnd you can see it just connects,\nthe antenna does,\n\n93\n00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.070\nby screwing down to the interface.\n\n94\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.090\nThe antenna itself is usually,\ndepending on the kind of antenna.\n\n95\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.515\nI'm going to show you what some different\nantenna types look like and are.\n\n96\n00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:09.200\nBut it's going to be flexible and\nyou can connect it up.\n\n97\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.680\nAnd you can move them around essentially\ncreating a directional capability for us.\n\n98\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.560\nAnd then we could pull the signal in.\n\n99\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.100\nAnd then on the back end right we simply\nconnect the cable up to whatever we're\n\n100\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.310\ngonna connect out to, typically a switch\nor another router in our interface.\n\n101\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.480\nAnd we're then able to move traffic\nback an forth between the LAN, the WAN,\n\n102\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.260\nthe wireless, and the connected world.\n\n103\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.825\nThat part is pretty straight\nforward right, pretty basic.\n\n104\n00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:36.150\nWhat we have to think about with regards\nto wireless forensics is, what takes\n\n105\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.580\nplace between the endpoint of ICE, where\nwe connect up over the wireless signal.\n\n106\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.170\nThe transmission medium out over the wire,\nor\n\n107\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.200\nrather out over the interfaces,\ninto the device where we will transit.\n\n108\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.431\nAnd what information looks like,\nwhere can we find it,\n\n109\n00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.480\nall the standard stuff\nwe've been talking about.\n\n110\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.037\nWhat logs are we looking for,\n\n111\n00:04:54.037 --> 00:04:57.089\nwhat kind of connectivity issues and\nconcerns do we have,\n\n112\n00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:01.840\nperhaps what kind of authentication and\nencryption we're gonna be dealing with.\n\n113\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.780\nWe'll talk a bit about that, what that is.\n\n114\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.510\nAre we using, God help us, WEP-PRA.\n\n115\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.148\nAre we using WPA, WPA2, WPA-Personal,\n\n116\n00:05:10.148 --> 00:05:14.170\nWPA2-Enterprise, of all these\ndifferent options, right.\n\n117\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.911\nAnd are we using In addition to all\nthat are we using a piece of hardware or\n\n118\n00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:24.505\na piece of software or\na combination of the two that allows\n\n119\n00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:27.880\nus to be able scan and track that traffic.\n\n120\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.003\nAnd we'll take a look at what we can do\nand how we can do that as a investigator\n\n121\n00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:35.028\nas essentially somebody is\ngoing to look for traffic.\n\n122\n00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:39.110\nBut we also need to think about what the\npotential information is that we are going\n\n123\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.883\nto find and that the bad\nactors maybe looking at right.\n\n124\n00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.195\nWe've talked about\nnetwork scanning before,\n\n125\n00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:47.949\nwe talked about the fact that you can pull\ndown network packets that we can look\n\n126\n00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.604\nat data essentially raw data in real\ntime dynamically across the network.\n\n127\n00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:55.178\nCan we do that on a wireless network, do\nit on a wireless network same way we do it\n\n128\n00:05:55.178 --> 00:05:57.390\non a wire network, no difference at all.\n\n129\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.220\nSo as a result,\nwhen we're scanning traffic and\n\n130\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.210\nlooking at it as a dynamic data\nfeed that we wanna investigate,\n\n131\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.890\nwe have to think about the fact that even\nthough part of the traffic transmission\n\n132\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.150\nmaybe essentially using radio\nsignals to go wirelessly.\n\n133\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.130\nThere's really no difference\nfrom our perspective.\n\n134\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.580\nThe only difference would be we need\nwireless drivers that will initialize and\n\n135\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.660\nlet us do the scanning.\n\n136\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.550\nWe need scanning software designed to be\nable to pick up that wireless information.\n\n137\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.210\nAnd so\nwe just want to be thinking about that.\n\n138\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.660\nJust want to know about that.\n\n139\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.380\nWant to make sure in our minds that we\nare aware of the fact that there is\n\n140\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.710\nSome difference but essentially at the\nsame time the majority of what we do is\n\n141\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.080\ngoing to be incredibly similar.\n\n142\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.490\nAnd all of the methodologies we've\nalready talked about with you.\n\n143\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.390\nAnd all of the thought processes about\n\n144\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.120\nlet's always start by making\nsure we have a court order\n\n145\n00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.130\nto ensure that we understand that we have\nthe legal right to go gather evidence.\n\n146\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.700\nLet's make sure we show up and\nsecure the scene.\n\n147\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.710\nLet's make sure we understand and\ndocument everything and\n\n148\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.000\nknow where everything is and\nwhat it is before we touch anything.\n\n149\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.990\nLet's make sure we then start\nto investigate methodically,\n\n150\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.350\nlet's make sure we go through documenting,\nplanning out plotting, if you will.\n\n151\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.200\nWhere everything is,\nwe haven't really spent a lot of time on\n\n152\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.120\nshowing you the specifics of how to\ndocument, we've talked about it,\n\n153\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.140\nwe've said hey, by the way, always take\npictures, always do this, always do that.\n\n154\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.610\nBut haven't really spent\nany time showing you,\n\n155\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.970\nwhat are some of the tools\nwhen they use to document.\n\n156\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.980\nSo we thought one of the things we'll do,\nwe'll take a look at it is hey.\n\n157\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.859\nWhat would it look like if we used\nthe tool to create a network map, right?\n\n158\n00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:29.650\nAnd we're going to take a look at what\nthat looks like on the wireless side.\n\n159\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.720\nDocument some things and\njust show you the thought process there.\n\n160\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.620\nBut we go through all of that and\nwe talk about how all of that works.\n\n161\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.980\nAnd this is the focus.\n\n162\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.320\nThis is kind of the entry point for\n\n163\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.040\nthe discussion with regards\nto wireless networks.\n\n164\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.530\nAnd specifically wireless forensics.\n\n165\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.120\nBut in order to do all that,\nwe gotta leave some vocabulary out.\n\n166\n00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.878\nWe gotta make sure we\nunderstand some terminology.\n\n167\n00:07:48.878 --> 00:07:53.353\nWe've been throwing some terminology\naround, talking about access points,\n\n168\n00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:55.890\ntalking about different kinds of antennas,\n\n169\n00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.708\ntalking about different\nkinds of connectivity.\n\n170\n00:07:58.708 --> 00:07:59.995\nBut we didn't really define those terms.\n\n171\n00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:01.159\nSo let's start by doing that.\n\n172\n00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:05.717\nWe mentioned WiFi overall,\nand wireless access.\n\n173\n00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:10.292\nAnd when we do that, we talk about\nthe 802.11 standard, which is going to\n\n174\n00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:14.690\nform the underlying set of rules and\nassumptions with regards to wireless.\n\n175\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.704\nSpecifically, the ieee 802.11 standard,\n\n176\n00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:22.725\nand their subcategories,\nA, B, G, N, I, etc.\n\n177\n00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:27.062\nAnd all of these, we'll go through these,\nare gonna be the categories we use,\n\n178\n00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:31.921\nwe manage information through, we connect\nacross, but IEEE802.11 is going to be\n\n179\n00:08:31.921 --> 00:08:36.360\nthe general standard, or group of\nstandards, that we reference for wireless.\n\n180\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.610\nNow, the IEEE is the organization\nglobally that manages all of it for\n\n181\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.875\nnetworking standards, telecommunication\nstandard, a lot of different things.\n\n182\n00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.420\nA.2.11 is the designation of the working\ngroups that works on wireless and\n\n183\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.250\nwireless standards, and\nthen there are subcategories.\n\n184\n00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.755\nI don't believe we put this in Notes,\nbut maybe, my good sir,\n\n185\n00:08:55.755 --> 00:08:57.745\nif you don't mind helping\nme behind the scenes,\n\n186\n00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:01.405\nyou could just make sure we\nhave the URL for the iTripoli.\n\n187\n00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:03.355\nSo that way, everybody out\nthere could just take a look.\n\n188\n00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.365\nYou could easily Google it.\n\n189\n00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:08.472\nBut we'll just make sure we have it,\ntherefore, if I just neglected to drop it\n\n190\n00:09:08.472 --> 00:09:13.160\nin there, itripoli.org, and then, yeah,\nthe subset for the 802.11 overall.\n\n191\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.708\nWireless, in terms of vocabulary WPA.\n\n192\n00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:18.730\nYou heard me mention that a minute ago.\n\n193\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.540\nWiFi protected access, this is our w\nLAN or wireless LAN authentication and\n\n194\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.470\ndata encryption protocol,\none of them, anyway.\n\n195\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.410\nAnd we use the different kinds\nof settings whether it's WAP,\n\n196\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.436\nwhich we shouldn't use anymore, we'll talk\nabout why, water to equivalent privacy,\n\n197\n00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:36.590\nWPA, WiFi protected access.\n\n198\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.990\nWPA personal WPA2, WPA2 enterprise.\n\n199\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.590\nWhatever it may be, we're going to use\none of those standards to then provide\n\n200\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.210\nauthentication and potentially\nencryption for our wireless connections.\n\n201\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.340\nA directional versus\nan omnidirectional antenna,\n\n202\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.060\nwe have different kinds of antenna types.\n\n203\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.120\nI thought it would be cool if we\ncould take a look for just a second.\n\n204\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.520\nJust went up to Google, did a quick\nGoogle search, did hey wireless antennas,\n\n205\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.880\ndid a little image, and\n\n206\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.310\nwhat you can find here is just all\nsorts of different antennae types.\n\n207\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.690\nAnd I would encourage you to take a look,\nyou've got different kinds,\n\n208\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.980\nwe have parabolic antennas, we have\nomni directional, we have directional,\n\n209\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.380\nwe have paddle, we have, as you can see,\nall sorts of different ones.\n\n210\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.292\nYou have dishes, right, we have all\nsorts of different antenna types.\n\n211\n00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:25.990\nProbably would be a good idea for\nyou to just take a look,\n\n212\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.540\nand you'll be somewhat familiar with them.\n\n213\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.420\nYou can go through and\nget a sense of them, here.\n\n214\n00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.920\nWe also can go in, and\nactually, as we did,\n\n215\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.060\njust quickly show you\nwhat a device looks like.\n\n216\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.820\nBut, we also, actually have a site we're\ngonna take you out to in a minute, and\n\n217\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.010\nshow you where you can look\nat a simulated interface.\n\n218\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.130\nFor a lot of these devices, and just get\na sense of how they're set up and play\n\n219\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.320\naround with them a little bit, which may\nbe actually kinda cool for you as well.\n\n220\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.240\nWe have the concept of a hotspot.\n\n221\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.290\nHotspot is where we're able to connect and\nuse wireless,\n\n222\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.180\nusually either locally if we have\nour own little hotspot running.\n\n223\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.580\nOr if we're outside in the wild\nsomewhere out in the world,\n\n224\n00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.490\nwe connect up to free WiFi, in a hotel,\nin a cafe whatever it may be.\n\n225\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.000\nThe hotspot is simply the place that we\nactually aggregate and connect through.\n\n226\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.350\nWe commonly call it an access point.\n\n227\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.870\nBut when we're out in public away from\nthe building, away from the environment,\n\n228\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.200\naway from the enterprise\nwe talk about a hotspot.\n\n229\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.820\nYou have one of those personal hotspots?\n\n230\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.910\nYou ever carry around a little Verizon\nwireless thing, or whatever it is?\n\n231\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.290\n&gt;&gt; I can tether with my phone,\nbut I don't have a hotspot.\n\n232\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.340\n&gt;&gt; So you tether, yeah.\n\n233\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.350\nA lot of people tether with their phone.\n\n234\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.305\nIn theory, I guess I could do that\nas well, but I just don't do it.\n\n235\n00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:30.820\nBut a lot of people have\nthose personal ones, right?\n\n236\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.755\nYou have those little personal devices.\n\n237\n00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They're actually kinda cool.\n\n238\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.780\nAnd more and more today,\ncars are coming wirelessly enabled.\n\n239\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.435\nWhich is just a ridiculous,\nabsolutely ridiculous, concept overall.\n\n240\n00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:44.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because going down the highway at 70,\n\n241\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.860\n80 miles an hour with all the other\ndistractions we already have, you wanna be\n\n242\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.655\nfooling around with wireless to make\nsure Pandora's working the right way.\n\n243\n00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:50.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, no doubt.\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna\n\n244\n00:11:50.597 --> 00:11:52.142\nbe definitely something\nyou wanna be doing.\n\n245\n00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:53.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, in your self-driving\n\n246\n00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:53.673\ncar, of course.\n\n247\n00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:56.693\n&gt;&gt; Well, of course, but then it gets\nin the way of you watching movies.\n\n248\n00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:57.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're busy\n\n249\n00:11:57.677 --> 00:12:00.815\ndoing the other stuff and having\na cocktail or two while you're driving.\n\n250\n00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:02.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have access points,\n\n251\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.770\nwe have hot spots, association is\nthe concept of being to connect.\n\n252\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.910\nWe talk about associating.\n\n253\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.105\nConnecting is associating to a hotspot or\na wireless access point.\n\n254\n00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:14.385\nI mentioned WEP, Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n255\n00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:17.945\nThis is the earliest WLAN,\nwireless LAN authentication and\n\n256\n00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:19.575\ndata encryption protocol.\n\n257\n00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:24.025\nAlthough, it is still, in theory,\nsupported and still available for\n\n258\n00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:27.205\nyou to use,\nit is not something we recommend you use.\n\n259\n00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.890\nIt has been unfortunately cracked,\n\n260\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.930\nalmost immediately after it\nwas brought forward and used.\n\n261\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.110\nIt became a problem, and we'll talk a bit\nmore about the history of the reasons why\n\n262\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.230\nin a couple of minutes, but the reality is\nwe don't want you to be able to use that.\n\n263\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.250\nWant you to substitute something\nlike WPA2, and use a higher\n\n264\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:53.340\nlevel stronger, protocol, whether it is\nultimately AES, which is the algorithm\n\n265\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.105\nthat's being underneath the hood now\nto do encryption, and a larger IV,\n\n266\n00:12:57.105 --> 00:13:01.365\na lager initialization vector,\nwhich solves a lot of the problems of web.\n\n267\n00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:05.485\nWe want you to be thinking more secure\nand, overall, using a secured connection.\n\n268\n00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.385\nNow, that's just in the real world.\n\n269\n00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:11.045\nAs an investigator, right, we obviously\nhope that people are smart and\n\n270\n00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:12.065\ndo the right thing.\n\n271\n00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:14.425\nBut the reality is we're looking for\ninformation.\n\n272\n00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:18.135\nWe have to to understand that people\nmay have been using older technology.\n\n273\n00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:22.430\nIt may have been using individual\nsolutions that may be different\n\n274\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.010\nfrom what the corporate entity does.\n\n275\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.320\nAnd we have to constantly\nbe on the look out for, and\n\n276\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.140\nconstantly be aware of the fact that there\nmaybe more than one way to do something.\n\n277\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.430\nAnd as a result,\neven though we stress strongly,\n\n278\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.340\nthat WEP should not be used anymore, that\ndoesn't mean that people aren't using it.\n\n279\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.500\nAnd we have to be open to the idea\nthat it still may be deployed, and\n\n280\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.900\nwe should never overlook the obvious\nthat's staring us in the face,\n\n281\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.120\njust because somebody says hey,\nthat's a bad idea.\n\n282\n00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.950\nDon't do that,\ndoesn't mean they're not doing.\n\n283\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.460\nIt just means that we may not agree\nwith the fact that it's being done.\n\n284\n00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.220\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n285\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.800\nBSS, basic service set.\n\n286\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.370\nSSID, service set identifier.\n\n287\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.410\nBSSID, basic service set identifier.\n\n288\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.970\nAnd ESSID,\nextended service set identifier.\n\n289\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.100\nWe got to think about all these things and\nunderstand that all of them, one way or\n\n290\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.940\nanother, are gonna help us identify\nthe wireless access point.\n\n291\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.220\nWhen we think about the wireless router,\nthe wireless access point we were just\n\n292\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.670\nshowing you, this device, whatever it is,\nis gonna have a unique identifier.\n\n293\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.140\nThink of it almost like A MAC address,\nIP address, whatever the case may be.\n\n294\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.830\nBut the service set identifier is\nnot gonna be a numerical identifier.\n\n295\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.280\nIt's usually a name, right?\n\n296\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.700\nWireless Access 1, ITProTV guest,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n297\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.320\nAnd that's the name that we, as a user\nfriendly name, often look for and scan for\n\n298\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.200\nwhen we look at wireless connections.\n\n299\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.300\nAnd we then connect into that\nparticular item we selected and\n\n300\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.290\nsay okay, I wanna connect to that.\n\n301\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.620\nNow, if we don't transmit the SSID,\n\n302\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.300\nthis is one of the basic steps involved\nwith securing a wireless access point.\n\n303\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.670\nDon't broadcast the SSID, so it stealths\nthe access point, it's harder to find.\n\n304\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.630\nThat doesn't mean that we can't find it,\nit just means that we have to do a little\n\n305\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.000\nnetwork scanning to look at the traffic\npackets that are going back and forth.\n\n306\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.650\nCapture them, we can then get the SS\nid out of the traffic stream,\n\n307\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.265\neven though it's not being broadcast, and\nwe then can figure out how to connect.\n\n308\n00:15:14.265 --> 00:15:15.925\nTools like Cain and Abel, and\n\n309\n00:15:15.925 --> 00:15:20.225\na lot of the other wireless access tools,\nAircrack-ng, whatever it may be.\n\n310\n00:15:20.225 --> 00:15:24.895\nThose tools can be used to be able to find\nSSID's, whether they're broadcast or not.\n\n311\n00:15:24.895 --> 00:15:27.724\nWe can easily see them,\ninteract with them, understand them.\n\n312\n00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:31.798\nSo, it's just something to consider,\nbut you should know what the SSID is,\n\n313\n00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:35.573\nthe basic service set identifier,\nthe extended service identifier.\n\n314\n00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:37.678\nSo, I want to make sure it kind\nof makes sense in these things.\n\n315\n00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:41.581\nWe talked about the wireless access\nstandard overall as being 802.11, I\n\n316\n00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:45.967\nmentioned that there are going to be some\nsubstandards, essentially just categories.\n\n317\n00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:50.440\nI mentioned A BG, I think I mentioned I,\nI may or may not have mentioned N.\n\n318\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.050\nThere's 802.16 as well.\n\n319\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.443\nAnd there's also Bluetooth.\nPeople often forget Bluetooth.\n\n320\n00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:58.493\nThey think about it, but\n\n321\n00:15:58.493 --> 00:16:01.657\nthey don't realize Bluetooth is actually\na separate standard on its own.\n\n322\n00:16:01.657 --> 00:16:03.265\nSo 802.11A.\n\n323\n00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:04.317\nWhat do we wanna know about these?\n\n324\n00:16:04.317 --> 00:16:07.889\nIf you're thinking about preparing for\nthe CHFI exam, probably be a good idea for\n\n325\n00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:09.672\nyou to know the following information.\n\n326\n00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:11.803\nWe did put this in the show notes for you.\n\n327\n00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:16.995\nWanna know the speed of which this\nparticular standard transmits at, and\n\n328\n00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:22.530\nthe radio frequency, or the signal\nfrequency the range that we transmit out.\n\n329\n00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.836\nSo for instance, do you know 802.11a?\n\n330\n00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:30.689\nDo you know the speed, and do you know,\nDaniel, the frequency range?\n\n331\n00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:34.614\n&gt;&gt; It's the five gigahertz of range.\n\n332\n00:16:34.614 --> 00:16:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Five gigahertz.\n\n333\n00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.739\n&gt;&gt; 54 megabits per second.\n\n334\n00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:38.100\n&gt;&gt; And it's 54 megabits, exactly.\n\n335\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.840\nYou see, you wanna be just like Daniel.\n\n336\n00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.750\nIf you could be like Daniel,\nthen you are golden.\n\n337\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.470\nAll right.\n\n338\n00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.427\nYou'd also be really tall,\nthat's the whole other story.\n\n339\n00:16:45.427 --> 00:16:48.847\nAll right, so 802.11 as Daniel\nsaid is absolutely correct,\n\n340\n00:16:48.847 --> 00:16:51.670\n54 megabytes at the five\ngigahertz frequency range.\n\n341\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.312\nSo, you just wanna walk down that list,\n802.11 B, 11 megs,\n\n342\n00:16:56.312 --> 00:17:02.146\n2.4 gigahertz, 802.11g, 54 megs,\n2.4 gigahertz, 802.11i.\n\n343\n00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:06.991\nThe thing we wanna know about that is that\nthat actually is the official standard\n\n344\n00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:12.215\nthat retires WEP formally, and replaces\nit with WPA2, which becomes more secure.\n\n345\n00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:13.695\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou have a sense of that.\n\n346\n00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:14.400\n&gt;&gt; It's about time.\n\n347\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's about time, that's right.\n\n348\n00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:16.935\nAnd when you go back and\n\n349\n00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:19.260\nlook at the history,\nit's funny how long it actually took.\n\n350\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.488\nAnd kind of the backing and forthing, with\nhey, we introduced WPA with Tkip to get\n\n351\n00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:27.673\nrid of Wep, but they didn't formalize\na standard until a couple of years later.\n\n352\n00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:30.858\nThen they brought forward WPA 2,\nbecause it was stronger,\n\n353\n00:17:30.858 --> 00:17:34.731\nbecause Tkip actually suffered from\nsome of the same issues that Wep had,\n\n354\n00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:37.853\nbecause of bad choices about\ninitialization and vector and\n\n355\n00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:42.360\nkey space size, and so, you don't get it\nright the first time, the second time.\n\n356\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.680\nPerhaps the third time\nseems to be the charm.\n\n357\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.609\nSo, that's what's going on there.\n\n358\n00:17:45.609 --> 00:17:47.150\n82.11N.\n\n359\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.269\nWe could broadcast the speeds over\n100 megabytes on dot wireless.\n\n360\n00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:54.075\nSo, this is ranking, or rather rating,\nratcheting, ratch, right?\n\n361\n00:17:54.075 --> 00:17:57.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Moving up the speed.\n\n362\n00:17:57.318 --> 00:18:01.857\nSo, 82.11N is gonna be just\na faster transmission standard.\n\n363\n00:18:01.857 --> 00:18:08.546\n802.116, 802.16,\nI wanna say 802.1116, no such thing.\n\n364\n00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:13.380\n802.16 is the wireless MAN standard, so\nsetting up metropolitan area networks,\n\n365\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.161\na broad coverage for, let's say it\nentire geography downtown maybe,\n\n366\n00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.410\nin the city center, something like that.\n\n367\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.136\nSo, wireless standard for\nthe Metropolinary network,\n\n368\n00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:24.260\nthat's what 802.16 speaks to.\n\n369\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.070\nAnd Bluetooth is our,\nnear field wireless, is I referred to.\n\n370\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.830\nIt's our personal wireless network\nwhere you got your device.\n\n371\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.380\nMaybe it's your phone,\nmaybe it's the Bluetooth headset or\n\n372\n00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.630\nwhatever you're using.\n\n373\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.510\nConnecting in your car, whatever that is.\n\n374\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.520\nThat's what Bluetooth is.\n\n375\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.590\nSo, you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n376\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.290\nWhen I talk about it, when I think\nabout setting up wireless security,\n\n377\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.140\nlet me just fix my little note here.\n\n378\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.090\nI didn't specify correctly.\n\n379\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.120\nWhen we think about wireless security,\nwe often want to think about, and\n\n380\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.750\nI already mentioned that we may\nnot broadcast the SSI data,\n\n381\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.690\njust stealth the access\npoint a little bit.\n\n382\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.640\nWe as investigators want to know that,\nbecause we'd have to go out and\n\n383\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.720\ndiscover all the access points.\n\n384\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.790\nAnd it may be hard to do that\nif they're broadcasting.\n\n385\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.800\nSo, want to make sure that we\nmay have to look for those.\n\n386\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.630\nBut also, we use MAC filtering.\n\n387\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.970\nWe may actually put an axis controller,\nessentially, on the device, and\n\n388\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.740\nwe may say these MAC\naddresses are allowed.\n\n389\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.670\nThese other MAC addresses, or anything\nelse not on the list, are not allowed.\n\n390\n00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.660\nKeep that in mind.\n\n391\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.760\nNow, why is that important?\n\n392\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.200\nWell, it's important for two reasons.\n\n393\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.370\nOne, it's important for\nus to know that again,\n\n394\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.420\nwe may not be able to find the device or\nconnect to it without certain information.\n\n395\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.400\nIt's also important for us to know that\nas we've talked about in prior episodes\n\n396\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.800\nMAC addresses can be spoofed.\n\n397\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.650\nWe've talked about this.\n\n398\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.720\nAnd we know that that can be the case.\n\n399\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.610\nAnd if we're spoofing the MAC address, and\n\n400\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.290\nsomebody has spoofed an address to\nconnect to a wireless access point,\n\n401\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.080\nwe wanna have a record of that,\nthere is gonna be information.\n\n402\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.340\nTypically, there's usually logging\ncapabilities on these devices, and\n\n403\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.670\nyou'll be able to gather\ncertain amount information.\n\n404\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.629\nWe may be able to see\nthat somebody connected,\n\n405\n00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:01.638\neven though they weren't\nsuppose to be there,\n\n406\n00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:04.566\nbecause that MAC address was spoofed,\nand we can tell that, right?\n\n407\n00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:07.555\nSo that's just something to think\nabout and consider as well.\n\n408\n00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:10.731\nWhen we think about\nwireless encryption types,\n\n409\n00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:14.000\nwe've already talked\nabout WEP a little bit.\n\n410\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.920\nTalked about WPA,\nWPA2 personal, WPA2 enterprise.\n\n411\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.470\nBut let's just run through some of the\nbasics that you just wanna be aware of.\n\n412\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.530\nWith regards to maybe either\nexam preparation, or certainly\n\n413\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.570\nas an investigator, you want to understand\nthe mechanics of how these devices, and\n\n414\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.260\nhow these systems, and\nthese algorithms are configured,\n\n415\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.420\nbecause you have to understand what\nkind of traffic you're looking at,\n\n416\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.270\nand what you may be able to do\nto capture and document it.\n\n417\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.670\nSo, Daniel, let's play a game.\n\n418\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.830\nWhen I say WEP, what do you,\nother than cringing and\n\n419\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:43.840\nsaying no, what do you think about when\nwe think about WEP in terms of wireless?\n\n420\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.570\nNot maybe so much, hey,\nhow does it work, or what does it do?\n\n421\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.830\nBut, generically, what comes to mind?\n\n422\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Insecurity.\n\n423\n00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.330\n&gt;&gt; Insecure or not secure, right?\n\n424\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.090\nOkay, so something we probably wouldn't\nwanna use, we would wanna stay away from.\n\n425\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.250\nBut we would probably\nwanna understand why.\n\n426\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.680\nSo let's just talk for a minute about\nwhy it's no longer valid to use it,\n\n427\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.080\nwhy is it insecure.\n\n428\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.470\nBecause from our perspective as\ninvestigators, we want to understand how\n\n429\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.180\nit got broken, so we'd better understand\nhow things are secured, but also,\n\n430\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.160\nunderstand the liability of use and\nwhat we may look for\n\n431\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.040\nin terms of information as a result.\n\n432\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.040\nSo WEP uses, or used, cuz you probably\ndon't use it much anymore, a 24 bit,\n\n433\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.620\nwhat we call IV.\n\n434\n00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.140\nInitialization vector.\n\n435\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.550\nAn initialization vector is essentially,\n\n436\n00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.220\njust gonna be an injection\nof a random code string.\n\n437\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.580\nIt's an often amount of string, right?\n\n438\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.902\nAnd it's just a set of items that are\nrandomly used either be a seed value to\n\n439\n00:21:33.902 --> 00:21:37.319\nstart off a process, or\nat some point during the process,\n\n440\n00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:42.270\ninjected along the way to create further\nrandomness, so that when we are decoding,\n\n441\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.732\nwhen we're decrypting, we would have\nto have the key, we would have to have\n\n442\n00:21:46.732 --> 00:21:51.309\nknowledge of what was done, the algorithm\nitself part of the crypto system.\n\n443\n00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:55.217\nAnd we would have to have knowledge of\nthe IV, the initialization vector or\n\n444\n00:21:55.217 --> 00:21:58.443\nrandom seed, in order to then\nwork backwards and unencrypt or\n\n445\n00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:01.000\ndecrypt the data, or\ndo whatever we're doing.\n\n446\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.591\nWe talked in our discussions in,\n\n447\n00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:09.710\nI wanna say it was back when we were\ndoing the hashing demonstrations, right?\n\n448\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.370\nAnd we talked about also\nwith password cracking,\n\n449\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.940\nwhen we took a look there at the idea that\nyou don't really reverse engineer a hash.\n\n450\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.184\nAnd you made the point when we were\ntalking that we're not really reverse\n\n451\n00:22:19.184 --> 00:22:20.250\nengineering it.\n\n452\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.090\nBut I said, we kinda are, right?\n\n453\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.690\nAnd I explained the concept to the fact\nthat although we technically are not\n\n454\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.810\nreally reverse engineering, the hash when\nwe do an assault on it with rainbow prac,\n\n455\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.940\nwe essentially are doing\na precomputed comparison.\n\n456\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.360\nBut the results are the same, right?\n\n457\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.630\nWe do reverse, and we get the password,\nat least if we're successful and\n\n458\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.520\nget the password.\n\n459\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.810\nSo, the concept of understanding the IV,\nand the fact that that's part of what we\n\n460\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.680\ncall the crypto system,\nthe entirety of how encryption is applied.\n\n461\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.910\nThe algorithm, the plain text data,\nthe mechanisms and\n\n462\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.430\nessentially things like the IB settings.\n\n463\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.085\nAnd then as we run it through and\nultimately on the back end and\n\n464\n00:22:55.085 --> 00:22:57.600\nget out the encrypted data,\nor whatever we will call it.\n\n465\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.870\nThe cryptogram, the incipher text,\n\n466\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.460\nit's all these different names that\nessentially represent the same thing.\n\n467\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.090\nThe stuff we wanna protect, right?\n\n468\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.039\nSo, the stuff on the back end,\nwe wanna understand that the stronger and\n\n469\n00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:10.844\nessentially longer the IV is,\nthe stronger it is.\n\n470\n00:23:10.844 --> 00:23:14.320\nAnd so the biggest issue we\nhave with WEP is the fact that\n\n471\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.268\nWEP when it was initialized\nwhen it was set up,\n\n472\n00:23:17.268 --> 00:23:22.634\nwhen it was thought through was offered as\na standard that had no peer review, nobody\n\n473\n00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:27.720\nlooked at it before they put it into\nplace, no essentially oversight, right?\n\n474\n00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.420\nFrom anybody including anybody who\nunderstood anything about cryptography\n\n475\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.950\nwas applied to the standard.\n\n476\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.450\nThey essentially just came up with it and\nsaid okay, hey, guess what?\n\n477\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.052\nThis is what we're doing, and\nnobody really looked under the hood and\n\n478\n00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:41.260\nsaid well, but what about this,\nwhat about that?\n\n479\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.410\nWhat about the fact that\na 24 bit IV is very small?\n\n480\n00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.765\nAnd as the result of that, it's most\nlikely going to be easy to figure out.\n\n481\n00:23:48.765 --> 00:23:52.405\nWell, nobody thought about that, and\nnobody, actually, the real issue,\n\n482\n00:23:52.405 --> 00:23:56.381\nultimately, with WEP, was the fact that\nnobody realized and thought through ahead\n\n483\n00:23:56.381 --> 00:23:59.629\nof time that the volumes of traffic\non wireless networks would jump so\n\n484\n00:23:59.629 --> 00:24:02.765\ndramatically, that we would begin\nto see these weaknesses almost\n\n485\n00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:04.333\nimmediately after deployment.\n\n486\n00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:08.889\nAnd so what really happened is we had\nsuch high volumes of usage in wireless\n\n487\n00:24:08.889 --> 00:24:13.384\nnetworks that because we had a small\nIV and a small what we call keyspace.\n\n488\n00:24:13.384 --> 00:24:16.559\nThe actual number of keys that\npotentially can be generated based\n\n489\n00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.580\non the implementation of\nwhat's called the algorithm.\n\n490\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.190\nThe RC4 algorithm which is the algorithm\nthat was used onto the hood to generate\n\n491\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.160\nencryption keys for our WEP.\n\n492\n00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.660\nBecause it was set up in such a way that\nit was implemented very quickly weak\n\n493\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.110\nencryption, weak implementation,\nkeyspace were small.\n\n494\n00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.460\nSo again, if I said you guess\na number between one to five.\n\n495\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.281\nRight, just wherever you guess but\nyou have five options, right, one,\n\n496\n00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:41.900\ntwo, three, four, five.\n\n497\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.120\nGuess what I'm thinking,\nnumber between one and five.\n\n498\n00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.910\nWhat would you guess?\n\n499\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n500\n00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Amazing, this amazing.\n\n501\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.710\nOne more time, what am I thinking?\n\n502\n00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.170\n&gt;&gt; Four.\n\n503\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.000\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding.\n\n504\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.860\nRight, so idea would be that there\nonly five choices, Daniel has\n\n505\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.670\na one in a five chance, 20% chance and a\none time going around of getting it right.\n\n506\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.330\nIf I don't repeat my options, he's got\na one in five chance five time and\n\n507\n00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.860\nafter that, we're done.\n\n508\n00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.594\nIf I start repeating, it may be very\neasy for him to guess that over time.\n\n509\n00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:13.860\nAnd this is essentially the issue\nwe had with WEP, right?\n\n510\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.510\nThe keys started to repeat after\na hundred thousand data packets or\n\n511\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.260\nwhatever it would have been,\nwe started reusing keys.\n\n512\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.480\nAnd so\nbecause we had a very small keyspace and\n\n513\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.540\na very weak initialization vector.\n\n514\n00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.050\nEssentially both were small.\n\n515\n00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.720\nThey should have both been larger and\nif they both would have been implemented\n\n516\n00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.330\nin a better way if there were\nmore options without repeating.\n\n517\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.630\nWe would actually probably not be talking\nabout WEP today the way we talk about it.\n\n518\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.140\nWe may very well still be saying hey, WEP,\nthat is the coolest thing in the world.\n\n519\n00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.180\nYou should be using that.\n\n520\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.260\nWhy aren't you using that?\n\n521\n00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.420\nWhy don't you use that stupid\nthing called, I don't know,\n\n522\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.870\nwhatever they would have called it, ABC or\nwhatever it would have been, right?\n\n523\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.290\nSo WEP really suffered\nfrom a lack of vision and\n\n524\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.410\na lack of understanding of what\nwe need to do to be secure.\n\n525\n00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.210\nThis is an illustrative story for us as\ninvestigators for the following reason.\n\n526\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.860\nIf we're not aware of the strengths and\nweaknesses of the systems we're\n\n527\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.080\ninvestigating, how can we possibly\ndo our job the right way?\n\n528\n00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.480\nHow can we possibly understand to\nknow exactly what we need to do?\n\n529\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.510\nTo ensure that we're providing\nthe right amount of information\n\n530\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.600\noversight inside analysis.\n\n531\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.080\nSo that we can report back on our findings\nand be authoritative, it's very tough for\n\n532\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.100\nus to do that.\n\n533\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.670\nSo we wanna keep this in mind and\nunderstand the failing,\n\n534\n00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.530\nif you will the shortcoming of WEP.\n\n535\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.770\nRC4 implemented incorrectly\nsmall keyspace, 24 bit IV, very,\n\n536\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.210\nvery small and that proves to be an issue.\n\n537\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.610\nWEP could have been implemented\nseveral different ways.\n\n538\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.200\nIf you look at the notes\nwe put together for you.\n\n539\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.213\nWe could have done 64 bit WEP,\n128 bit WEP, 256 bit WEP.\n\n540\n00:26:38.213 --> 00:26:42.980\nA 64 bit WEP solution would\nhave used a 40 bit key.\n\n541\n00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.550\n40 bit key is very, very small and\nthat was one of the issues we had.\n\n542\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.100\n128 bit WEP would have used 104 bit key.\n\n543\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.550\nAnd 256 bit WEP would\nhave used a 232 bit key.\n\n544\n00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.520\nStill relatively small by comparison\nto some of the other stuff we do.\n\n545\n00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.740\nWPA, it steps up our game a little bit.\n\n546\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.290\nIt's implemented as I\nsuggested a little bit ago\n\n547\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.580\nas a stopgap measure to\nprevent us from using WEP.\n\n548\n00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.560\nIt switches to something known as TKIP,\n\n549\n00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.210\ntemporal key integrity protocol\nis what TKIP stands for.\n\n550\n00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.350\nAnd it was used for a little bit, but\n\n551\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.555\nultimately it suffered from\nsome of the same weaknesses.\n\n552\n00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:18.565\nWe double the size of the IV.\n\n553\n00:27:18.565 --> 00:27:24.075\nSo with WPA and TKIP,\nwe use a 48 bit IV instead of a 24 bit IV.\n\n554\n00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:28.405\nAnd we use RC4, the same underlying\nalgorithm that was used with WEP.\n\n555\n00:27:28.405 --> 00:27:31.715\nAnd people often hear this and say well,\nwhy do they go back to the same algorithm?\n\n556\n00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:33.655\nWasn't the algorithm the problem?\n\n557\n00:27:33.655 --> 00:27:35.055\nThe algorithm was not the problem,\n\n558\n00:27:35.055 --> 00:27:38.920\nRC4 is still used today as\na valid algorithm for encryption.\n\n559\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.500\nIt's a perfectly fine algorithm,\n\n560\n00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.800\nthe problem was it was implemented poorly,\nright?\n\n561\n00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.110\nSo, bad choices were really\nwhat the downfall was there,\n\n562\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.380\nnot the algorithm itself.\n\n563\n00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.800\nSo we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n564\n00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.330\nSo we use RC4, we create stronger keys,\n\n565\n00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.830\n128 bit keys for encryption,\n64 bit key for authentication.\n\n566\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.670\nBut ultimately, we still run into issues\nbecause of the implementation and\n\n567\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.160\nsome of the choices made.\n\n568\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.735\nSo we move then with the 802.11i\nstandard towards WPA2.\n\n569\n00:28:07.735 --> 00:28:12.505\nWe replace RC4 with AES, the Advanced\nEncryption Standard algorithm.\n\n570\n00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:15.675\nThe new standard that is and\nnew is a relative term these days,\n\n571\n00:28:15.675 --> 00:28:18.390\nbut newer standard that\nis now being used for\n\n572\n00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.930\nencryption at the government\nmilitary levels.\n\n573\n00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.330\nIt's considered to be the strongest\nalgorithm currently available for that.\n\n574\n00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.330\nWe have a 48 bit IV at 828 bit key.\n\n575\n00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.410\nBut it's got a variable key size, so\n\n576\n00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.460\nwe can actually increase\nthe size of the key if necessary.\n\n577\n00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.610\nAnd we have with WPA2/WPA2 Enterprise,\nthe added\n\n578\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.040\ncapability of or requirement of using EAP,\nextensible authentication protocol.\n\n579\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.100\nFor additional authentication,\nsolutions, bring in smart cards,\n\n580\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.160\ndigital IDs with certificates,\nthings like that.\n\n581\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.970\nAnd RADIUS, the use of RADIUS solution,\nwhich is gonna allow us to do call or\n\n582\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.380\nin this case,\naudit tracking of sessions, right?\n\n583\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.960\nCuz RADius was initially a technology\nused to be able to track and\n\n584\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.280\nstill is used to track inbound and\noutbound sessions across a remote gateway.\n\n585\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.480\nLooking at usage, authentication,\nthings like that, but\n\n586\n00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.325\nwe used to use it to track\ninbound traffic over modems.\n\n587\n00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:13.020\nSo you refer calling\ncounting at that point.\n\n588\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.930\nThis days it's use just for\n[INAUDIBLE] up in traffic on the web,\n\n589\n00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.310\nso ISPs, Internet Server Provider\nwill use radio service transient.\n\n590\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.410\nTrack what you're doing, this is why\nthey send you those nice little hey,\n\n591\n00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.520\nstop doing those kind of letters every so\noften.\n\n592\n00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.910\nCuz they know that you're downloading all\nthese stuff that you're not suppose to do\n\n593\n00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.750\nand this how they actually track at.\n\n594\n00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.960\nSo here's are just things that think\nabout kind of the background there.\n\n595\n00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.030\nIn addition to all of\nthe standards we talk about.\n\n596\n00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.105\nWe talk about different ways we can\nactually detect wireless signal, right?\n\n597\n00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:44.189\nWe spoke a little bit about this when\nwe said hey, we wanna go out and\n\n598\n00:29:44.189 --> 00:29:46.050\nwe wanna use these kind of antennas.\n\n599\n00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:50.090\nWe'd see what kind of signal we have and\nwe would also we then look for the SSID.\n\n600\n00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.420\nAnd look for the MAC filtering and\n\n601\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.210\nsee whether we have a MAC address\non the list that can get in or not.\n\n602\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.570\nBut we can actually use a mechanism\ncalled war driving, war chalking,\n\n603\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.850\nwar flying, war walking, war whatever.\n\n604\n00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.270\nYou can fill in the blank.\n\n605\n00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.100\nThe idea is that this comes from the old\n\n606\n00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.180\nschool way of doing things where we\ndid was was called war dialing, right?\n\n607\n00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.950\nAnd war dialing would allow us to\nhack into systems using modems.\n\n608\n00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.070\nIf you have ever seen the movie War Games.\n\n609\n00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.370\nWe've talked about this in at\nleast one of our other episodes.\n\n610\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.060\nYou would have seen a perfect\nexample of war dialing because\n\n611\n00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.700\nMatthew Broderick's character.\n\n612\n00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.520\nAt almost the very beginning of the movie\nis using this technique to be able to\n\n613\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.650\nbreak into what he thinks\nis a gaming system.\n\n614\n00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.230\nEssentially a big online\ngame manufacturer and\n\n615\n00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.550\nhe wants to figure out what\nkind of software is there.\n\n616\n00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:38.030\nSo he's using a modem to dial through,\nlooking for open modem lines.\n\n617\n00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.880\nHe finds one or more of them, tags them,\ncomes back to them, dials in and\n\n618\n00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.850\nthen tries to connect.\n\n619\n00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.110\nAnd figure out the username and\npassword, whatever.\n\n620\n00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.840\nThis is the traditional\nclassic thought process.\n\n621\n00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.410\nWhen we translate this into wireless,\nwe think about using the same technique.\n\n622\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.750\nBut now we give it a different name\nbecause if we're doing war shocking,\n\n623\n00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.990\nwhat we're doing is walking around.\n\n624\n00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:03.070\nFinding wireless signals usually\nopen wireless access points or\n\n625\n00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.270\naccess points that may not be truly open,\nbut\n\n626\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.090\nare configured in such a way that\nwouldn't be too hard for us to get in.\n\n627\n00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.200\nAnd we're marking and I'm gonna show you\nsome examples of these signs in a minute,\n\n628\n00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.690\nwe're marking the building or\nthe area right around there.\n\n629\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.410\nAnd we're gonna put up\nsome sort of a single that\n\n630\n00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.720\nit is essentially like graffiti, right?\n\n631\n00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.970\nIt's a hidden language.\n\n632\n00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.340\nIf you know the sign and\nyou look for it and\n\n633\n00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.790\nsee it, you know there's an open\naccess point in the area.\n\n634\n00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.980\nBut you may walk right by it and just see\nsome scribbles on the wall or on a street\n\n635\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.060\nsign or on a mail box, they're all over\nthe place and you may not realize it.\n\n636\n00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.020\nAnd it's kind of interesting because\nif you are tuned in to this language,\n\n637\n00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.200\nyou can actually find these open\naccess points wherever you are.\n\n638\n00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.060\nAnd if you go out in wherever\nyou live around the world and\n\n639\n00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.630\nyou start looking especially\nin downtown areas.\n\n640\n00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:47.710\nAt buildings and\n\n641\n00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.530\nthe supporting infrastructures that says\nstreet signs are good choice for this.\n\n642\n00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.838\nWhoever looks at the back of a street\nsign and pays attention to what's there.\n\n643\n00:31:53.838 --> 00:31:57.182\nBut the [INAUDIBLE] is if you start\nlooking, you will find more often than\n\n644\n00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:59.968\nnot that a lot of these signs\nhave actually been painted on or\n\n645\n00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:02.720\nhave been drawn on in marker and\nyou'll begin to see them.\n\n646\n00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.602\nLet's take a look at what\nthey look like actually.\n\n647\n00:32:04.602 --> 00:32:07.515\nAgain, all I did was go out.\n\n648\n00:32:07.515 --> 00:32:08.354\nI just did a Google search really quick.\n\n649\n00:32:08.354 --> 00:32:13.980\nAnd you can see for instance that\nI'm pointing to any one of these.\n\n650\n00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.350\nCan we just go full screen for a second.\n\n651\n00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.370\nJust make it a little bit bigger.\n\n652\n00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.960\nThere you go.\n\n653\n00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.860\nYou can look these up on your own but\nyou can see the kind of signs we have.\n\n654\n00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.750\nSomething like this one, a circle with\ntwo half moons in it is an open node.\n\n655\n00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:29.630\nWhereas you have a closed node, which is\nthe circle with some other stuff in it.\n\n656\n00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.100\nAnd you got a wet node,\nwhich is the one with the key.\n\n657\n00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.660\nAnd then it's got the two circles,\n\n658\n00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.030\nthe half circles over it denoting\nthat it's set up that way.\n\n659\n00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.600\nSo you can go through.\n\n660\n00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.010\nAnd you can take a look at and\nfind all these signals.\n\n661\n00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.940\nAnd I see them all the time.\n\n662\n00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.930\nOne of the things I'll, if I'm traveling\na lot and I'm out somewhere and\n\n663\n00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.350\nI have meetings with clients downtown or\nwhatever.\n\n664\n00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.260\nSo I'm kind of walking or driving or\nwhatever, I'll keep my eyes open.\n\n665\n00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.570\nYou see them all over the place.\n\n666\n00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.280\nThere actually are websites\nout there that you can go to.\n\n667\n00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.300\nI use them from time\nto time when I travel,\n\n668\n00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.940\nthat you can actually do a pre-search.\n\n669\n00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.240\nYou can go out and look for open wireless\naccess points by city, by geography.\n\n670\n00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.760\nYou could pull up a coverage map and\n\n671\n00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.130\nit will actually tell you\nexactly where they are.\n\n672\n00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.390\nPublicly available information.\n\n673\n00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:10.980\nYou're not hacking.\n\n674\n00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.460\nYou're not doing anything wrong.\n\n675\n00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.580\nBut it's just information that somebody's\ncompiled and put together for you.\n\n676\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.790\nSo you can actually go out and take a look\nat that stuff as well if you want to.\n\n677\n00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.140\nIt's just kind of interesting.\n\n678\n00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.680\nSo we have all these\ndifferent ways of doing this.\n\n679\n00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.010\nThis is, we're chalking.\n\n680\n00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.390\nWe're walking as you're doing the same\nthing, but you're walking around.\n\n681\n00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.890\nNow keep in mind today you know with\neverybody having one or more smart devices\n\n682\n00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.040\nwith wireless capabilities on them,\nit's very simple to walk around and\n\n683\n00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.800\nessentially do a little\nwireless coverage survey.\n\n684\n00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.660\nYears ago you had to have\nsomething like a fluke analyzer or\n\n685\n00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.825\na laptop or whatever would have been.\n\n686\n00:33:42.825 --> 00:33:44.590\nIt was a little bulkier\na little harder to do.\n\n687\n00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.450\nNot real hard today, just walk around with\nyour phone, turn on the wireless signal\n\n688\n00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.530\nfinder and just see what pops up as you\nwalk around, if you think about it right?\n\n689\n00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.280\nSo we can easily war walk, war drive,\nsame idea but you're in a car.\n\n690\n00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.020\nPlease don't do this by the way,\nright, don't have the phone,\n\n691\n00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.610\ntrying to pay attention to this and\ndriving.\n\n692\n00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Bring a friend.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Have somebody with you.\n\n693\n00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.440\nHave them do this, right?\n\n694\n00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.410\nWe're flying, same idea,\nwe're up in a plane, just looking for\n\n695\n00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.780\nwireless signals or open, or\navailable to you, wherever you may go.\n\n696\n00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.380\n&gt;&gt; Friends and I actually do this a lot.\n\n697\n00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.040\nWe're driving around, and\nthen we would find open access points.\n\n698\n00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.880\nAnd then we would typically print out a\npage on their network, find a printer and\n\n699\n00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.580\nprint it out, and say, hey,\nyour network is insecure.\n\n700\n00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.190\nYou might want to take\nthese steps to secure it.\n\n701\n00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.970\nAnd of course,\nit would be sitting on the printer\n\n702\n00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.550\nwhen somebody came to work the next day or\nwhatever.\n\n703\n00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.555\nAnd we were trying to\nmake the place better.\n\n704\n00:34:29.555 --> 00:34:31.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you put a little note that said,\n\n705\n00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.960\nbrought to you by and\nhad your name and contact info?\n\n706\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Adam Gordon.\n\n707\n00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.060\n&gt;&gt; So the police knew where to find you\nwhen they came to look for you, right?\n\n708\n00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.530\n&gt;&gt; You don't like this,\ncontact Adam Gordon.\n\n709\n00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:39.795\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n710\n00:34:39.795 --> 00:34:41.563\nTell them who it was, and obviously.\n\n711\n00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:42.637\nSo, all kidding aside.\n\n712\n00:34:42.637 --> 00:34:44.956\nDaniel brings up a really\ninteresting point,\n\n713\n00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:47.817\none that I just want to focus\non with you for half a second.\n\n714\n00:34:47.817 --> 00:34:50.010\nSo, whatever you do, antics aside, right?\n\n715\n00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.750\nGood or bad meaning of intention.\n\n716\n00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.910\nBut let's just create a clear\ndemarkation for you for just a second.\n\n717\n00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:58.420\nSo what Daniel described,\nwith the best of intentions, right?\n\n718\n00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; No kidding, I know what he is saying,\n\n719\n00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.690\nthat he did it because he wanted and\nhis friends wanted to show, right,\n\n720\n00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.090\nthese people that there was an issue.\n\n721\n00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.330\nAnd help them to understand how to do\nsomething better to protect themselves.\n\n722\n00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.460\nSo it was done with the best\nof intentions, right?\n\n723\n00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.870\nBut having said that, the challenge\nthat we have with this kinda behavior\n\n724\n00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.550\nIs that essentially at the end of the day,\nthis is still hacking, right?\n\n725\n00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.620\nAnd although you are doing it with\nthe means and the mechanism and\n\n726\n00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.730\nthe thought process of doing good, someone\ncan easily interpret that action as you,\n\n727\n00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.880\nand rightly so,\npotentially trespassing in their network.\n\n728\n00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.520\nSo, I just want to point out that a lot\nof times we'll tell you stories, and\n\n729\n00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.380\nwe'll joke around about things.\n\n730\n00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.260\nA lot of that stuff's cool,\nfun and it is meant to help you\n\n731\n00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.760\nunderstand in a light hearted\nway the things we talk about.\n\n732\n00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.880\nAnd it's very rare that we get really\nserious about something like this.\n\n733\n00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.910\nBut it's one of those few themes that\nwe have to be really specific about.\n\n734\n00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.580\nIf you're going to do something like\nthat the best way to handle that is\n\n735\n00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.720\nfigure out that that's\nan issue like Daniel did.\n\n736\n00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.780\nAnd instead of providing\nevidence to the fact by literally\n\n737\n00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.460\ntrespassing into someone's network.\n\n738\n00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.600\nUsing their printer,\nprinting something out.\n\n739\n00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.610\nIf you feel that you want to help them,\nyou need to contact them via email or\n\n740\n00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.340\nsomething like that.\n\n741\n00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.440\nWhatever it would have been.\n\n742\n00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.880\nBut in a way that does not actually\nallow you to set foot in their system.\n\n743\n00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.940\nBecause what can happen, and the reason\nI'm just pointing this out for you so\n\n744\n00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.620\nyou know, is that while it probably\ndidn't happen it sounds like, right?\n\n745\n00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH]. &gt;&gt; But somebody could\neasily have turned around, looked at that\n\n746\n00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:27.300\nas an intrusion, tracked that back in\ntheory to Daniel and his friends or\n\n747\n00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.460\nwhoever, and actually try to prosecute\nthem for breaking into the network.\n\n748\n00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.150\nAnd while that would have probably\nnever happened, you just don't know.\n\n749\n00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.850\nAnd when you work in this field,\nyou do what we do, or\n\n750\n00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:41.690\nyou want to become somebody who's able\nto do what we're talking about doing,\n\n751\n00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.000\nthe first and most important rule you\nhave to follow as a security professional\n\n752\n00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.880\nis that you have to make\nsure that you do no harm.\n\n753\n00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.440\nRight?\n\n754\n00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.190\nAnd again, being very clear and\njust being very unequivocal with you.\n\n755\n00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.130\nNot that Daniel did anything wrong but\n\n756\n00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.230\njust the way he delivered the message,\nright?\n\n757\n00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.750\nWas the one piece of the puzzle\nthat in a real world scenario\n\n758\n00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.490\nyou would want to think\nabout doing differently.\n\n759\n00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:06.440\nIt's a really important,\nreally valuable story, right?\n\n760\n00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.300\nWith a good ending.\n\n761\n00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.390\nBut one that we want to modify and\n\n762\n00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.870\nmake sure that you deliver the right way,\nalright?\n\n763\n00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.790\nJust think about that.\n\n764\n00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.010\n&gt;&gt; And why is\n&gt;&gt; Shame on you.\n\n765\n00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n766\n00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:15.890\nYeah.\nHe makes it exactly right.\n\n767\n00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.340\nI remember when this\nwas extremely popular,\n\n768\n00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.900\ncustomer was drawing was\nwas coming out in zone.\n\n769\n00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.240\n&gt;&gt; And everybody did it.\n\n770\n00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.400\n&gt;&gt; Everybody was doing it.\n\n771\n00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.240\nIt was very popular thing to do, but there\nwork instances were people were doing\n\n772\n00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.710\nwhat, were doing and trying to\nsay We're trying to help you out.\n\n773\n00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.630\nI connected to your network,\nbut it's wide open.\n\n774\n00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.680\nAnd they would call the police and\nsay, this person attacked my network.\n\n775\n00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.160\nAnd they're like,\nno I'm trying to help you.\n\n776\n00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.230\nNo, you attacked my network.\n\n777\n00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:41.810\nAnd then they had to go through\nthe legal ramifications thereof.\n\n778\n00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.662\nSo yes, we're not endorsing-\n&gt;&gt; We just don't want you to get caught.\n\n779\n00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.160\n&gt;&gt; Correct [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; In a bad scenario.\n\n780\n00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.700\n&gt;&gt; We're not saying go out there and\ndo this.\n\n781\n00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.920\nWe're saying this is something\nthat has happened and does happen.\n\n782\n00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.740\nand here's why and how.\n\n783\n00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.930\nThat being said,\n\n784\n00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.730\nWe're talking about things that probably\naren't specifically a malicious attack.\n\n785\n00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.420\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; We do\n\n786\n00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.090\nneed to get into attacks that are\nmalicious, how they work through wireless.\n\n787\n00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.080\nBut we're well out of\ntime in this episode.\n\n788\n00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.500\nWe've rambled on about cool stories and\nanecdotes for far too long.\n\n789\n00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.160\nHopefully you'll join us in part two\nThat being said, Adam, thanks for\n\n790\n00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:12.920\njoining us today.\n\n791\n00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.700\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n792\n00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.760\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n793\n00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.130\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n794\n00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n795\n00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.998\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n796\n00:38:23.998 --> 00:38:27.782\n[MUSIC]\n\n797\n00:38:27.782 --> 00:38:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:49.320\nwe're gonna continue our conversations\nhere, talking some more about wireless.\n\n23\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.720\nSo we left off speaking about having laid\nout the general overview of wireless,\n\n24\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.890\nreally speaking about the vocabulary.\n\n25\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.587\nTalking about the different ways in\nwhich we can associate the different\n\n26\n00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:03.640\ncommunication and connectivity standards.\n\n27\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.770\n802.11, fill in the blank, a, b,\ng, and i, whatever it may be.\n\n28\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.940\nAnd what we wanted to do is spend\na few minutes educating us,\n\n29\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.870\nyou, me, all of us, with regards to\nbeing investigators in digital forensics\n\n30\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.540\nprofessionals about attacks that can\noccur against wireless networks, right.\n\n31\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.755\nIt's important for us to know\nwhat kind of attacks may occur so\n\n32\n00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:27.055\nthat we have a sense of what the tell\ntale signs will be we wanna look for.\n\n33\n00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:30.305\nSo that as we do our investigation, we\nhave a sense of the kind of things that we\n\n34\n00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:34.145\nmay tip us off, right, that may hint out\nthe fact that something's gone wrong.\n\n35\n00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:38.268\nSo, we think about access control attacks,\nwe think about integrity attacks,\n\n36\n00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:41.315\nabout confidentiality attacks,\navailability attacks.\n\n37\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:45.240\nSo different categories in other words\nright off a attacks that may occur.\n\n38\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.766\nWanna run through some of\nthe common ones with you,\n\n39\n00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.212\njust make sure you're\ncomfortable with them.\n\n40\n00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:52.720\nThe thing about access control a attacks,\nattacks against the infrastructure,\n\n41\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.100\nthat allows us to actually\nuse wireless networks.\n\n42\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.085\nThings like a rogue access\npoint could be set up.\n\n43\n00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:02.140\nSo somebody stets up an access point\nthat is controlled by bad actor and\n\n44\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.980\nthey draw people the way and\nget them to connect to that.\n\n45\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.910\nMaybe getting them then to load malware in\ntheir system, or whatever the case maybe,\n\n46\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.060\nthat would be an attack that we\nwould have to really think about.\n\n47\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.110\nWe may not be able to find\nevidence of that directly in\n\n48\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.740\nthe sense that the rogue access\npoint is left laying around.\n\n49\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.684\nBut what would we find?\n\n50\n00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:23.200\nIndirectly we'd find the evidence\nof connectivity in the log files on\n\n51\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.450\nthe targeted machines.\n\n52\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.980\nWe would find evidence of the software\nthat may have been installed, right.\n\n53\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.580\nSo those are the kinda things that we'd\nwanna think about, wanna be aware of, or\n\n54\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.620\nat least be looking at in our mind saying,\nhey, how do I know that this took place?\n\n55\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.000\nWell, I see evidence in our systems of\n\n56\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.190\nIP addresses floating around that\nnobody seems to be able to account for.\n\n57\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.100\nI see MAC addresses that don't\nbelong to us, things like that.\n\n58\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.025\nThose may be tell-tale signs of\ninformation that we'd want to investigate.\n\n59\n00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.820\nWe've talked about MAC spoofing before,\n\n60\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.118\nthe ability to be able to change your\nMAC address and masquerade as somebody.\n\n61\n00:02:54.118 --> 00:02:56.470\nThat where to happen again,\nevidence in log files,\n\n62\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.740\nthings like that would typically be found.\n\n63\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.980\nWe often don't think about this, but ad\nhoc association, the ability to associate\n\n64\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.180\nas you literally walk by or drive by with\nan access point as you hop from network\n\n65\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.220\nto network or perhaps access\npoint to access point, can occur.\n\n66\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.565\nWe usually wanna block ad hoc\nassociation so our wireless device,\n\n67\n00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:20.470\nwhether it's a phone,\nan end point like a laptop or\n\n68\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.360\na tablet, may have the ability to simply\nto connect anything that pops up.\n\n69\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.935\nOn my phone, and probably on some\nof your phones as well I have,\n\n70\n00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:32.485\nwhen I turn on wireless,\nI have it pop up automatically.\n\n71\n00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.615\nIt says hey,\nthere's a wireless access point.\n\n72\n00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:35.360\nDo you want to connect?\n\n73\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.662\nI have a little security warning that\npops up and gives me the option so\n\n74\n00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:41.642\nthat I don't just randomly associate\nwithout knowing what it is.\n\n75\n00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:42.592\nWant to think about that.\n\n76\n00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:46.462\nIf we're not doing that and somebody\ndoes automatically connect to something,\n\n77\n00:03:46.462 --> 00:03:49.672\nespecially if you remember those\nwireless access points, right, so\n\n78\n00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:51.160\nyou'd be connected to them before.\n\n79\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.150\nYou put them in the memory\nof the system there,\n\n80\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.670\nmuch like a cookie essentially,\nstoring that connectivity information.\n\n81\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.570\nWhen we connect back in, what happens is\nhow do we really know we're connecting\n\n82\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.880\nback to that wireless access point that\nwe supposedly connected to before?\n\n83\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.247\nMaybe somebody's combining the concept of\nad hoc association with a rogue access\n\n84\n00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:13.487\npoint, and they're spoofing the access\npoint and making it look like it really\n\n85\n00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:17.810\nis, I don't know, guest access one,\nwhen in fact, it's really not, right.\n\n86\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.390\nAnd then that can lead to compromise.\n\n87\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.710\nSo wanna be aware of that.\n\n88\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.050\nClient misassociation,\n\n89\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.540\nwe connect to an access point we're not\nsupposed to connect to because it's open.\n\n90\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.480\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n91\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.300\neven though it should have been secured,\nthat can be a problem.\n\n92\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.940\nUnauthorized association,\nwe get into something we're not\n\n93\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.470\nsupposed to see because somebody screwed\nup and didn't secure it the right way.\n\n94\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.570\nAnd or a promiscuous client, a client\nthat is scanning in promiscuous mode\n\n95\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.130\nthat is able to connect or find things\nthat we may not normally wanna see.\n\n96\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.160\nOr a client that gives out information.\n\n97\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.560\nHey, look at all the shares I have\non my machine and all this stuff.\n\n98\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.050\nAnd we're not securing the client.\n\n99\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.710\nAgain, one of the things to think about is\nare we using a firewall on the endpoint,\n\n100\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.210\non the client,\nas well as connecting to a secure network?\n\n101\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.270\nFirewalls run,\ntraditionally are normally are set up and\n\n102\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.730\nrun, on every endpoint we have\ntoday out of the box traditionally.\n\n103\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.010\nFirewalls are installed and configured\nin most operating systems today.\n\n104\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.900\nBut not in every one and not all the time.\n\n105\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.030\nWe may turn them off because they get\nin the way of certain capabilities or\n\n106\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.650\nfeatures or things we wanna do.\n\n107\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.480\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n108\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.100\nthis is one of those things that as\nin investigator we'd wanna look at.\n\n109\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.110\nWe'd wanna be aware of, we'd wanna know,\nwhether the firewall is up on the device\n\n110\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.290\nand if so what profile, what protection\nare we essentially envisioning or using.\n\n111\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.840\nIf we're not, hey why not?\n\n112\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.510\nWhy didn't we have that firewall running,\nright?\n\n113\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.540\nBecause if you think about, Darren, you've\nprobably had this happen to you I'm sure.\n\n114\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.954\nYou're doing administrative work,\nsupport where things you share with\n\n115\n00:05:38.954 --> 00:05:42.460\nus over the stories we told that\nyou've done in prior lifetimes, right.\n\n116\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.930\nAnd certainly I've done\na lot of that work,\n\n117\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.780\nI'm sure a lot of you\nhave in your capacities.\n\n118\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.957\nHave you ever had an instance where\nyou've had to connect to a machine and\n\n119\n00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:52.612\nhad to drop the firewall to get in or\nsomething's gone on, or\n\n120\n00:05:52.612 --> 00:05:55.185\nmaybe the firewall's blocking\nthe inbound connection?\n\n121\n00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.100\nThat kinda stuff happens, right?\n\n122\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.408\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, happens all the time,\nyou just get blocked.\n\n123\n00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:00.310\nWindows firewalls are notorious for this.\n\n124\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.250\nYou're thinking, let me just get in.\n\n125\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.930\nWhat's going on here?\n\n126\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.740\nI can't get in.\n\n127\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.800\nThe Windows' firewall's actually\na pretty good firewall.\n\n128\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.470\nIt does a good job of\nblocking you when necessary.\n\n129\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.130\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n130\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.420\nAnd of course the downside is that because\nit's so good, we may on occasion have to\n\n131\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.472\nactually do a little architecture\nreworking, if you will.\n\n132\n00:06:16.472 --> 00:06:18.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of Windows firewall,\n\n133\n00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.210\nwhy don't we just take a look\nreal quick fr just one second.\n\n134\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.362\nSo since you mentioned, can we go full\nscreen cuz I'm not running our zoom it\n\n135\n00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:26.270\ntool on this particular desktop,\nI can't zoom all the way in.\n\n136\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.490\nSo here the Windows Firewall,\nwell this is Windows 10, right.\n\n137\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.980\nSo Windows Firewall, real simple to\nget to in the Control Panel, right.\n\n138\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.460\nWe just go to Windows Firewall.\n\n139\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.160\nIt is on as you can see on our\ndifferent networks, and it's set up.\n\n140\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.900\nAnd the thing that we wanna understand is,\nlook, active private network,\n\n141\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.600\nITProTV Guest, right,\nwe see our network there.\n\n142\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.340\nIf we want to change or\nturn on or off the firewall or\n\n143\n00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.320\nchange our settings,\nwith administrative rights, right.\n\n144\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.800\nAnd again, we may not as a normal\nuser have those rights, but\n\n145\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.520\nif we do it's not real hard to go in and\nshut down the firewall.\n\n146\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.580\nSo as an investigator we wanna check this,\nmake sure we know that this is running for\n\n147\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.830\nour wireless and our wired networks even\nthough we're talking about wireless.\n\n148\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.100\nBut more broadly do we\nwanna be aware of this?\n\n149\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.120\nWe definitely wanna go in and\nwe wanna take a look, right,\n\n150\n00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.570\nwe wanna make sure we know what's there.\n\n151\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.960\nBecause if we see the firewall's turned\noff, that should tell us something,\n\n152\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.010\nespecially if we have a baseline that\nsays our normal desktop image or\n\n153\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.490\nnormal device configuration should\nrun with the firewall, right.\n\n154\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.050\nIf that's our standard,\nthen maybe malware's involved.\n\n155\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.070\nMaybe Daniel's shell code was\nmore successful than we realized,\n\n156\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.950\nright, as we've talked\nabout in prior episodes.\n\n157\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.930\nAnd maybe part of that was, was part of\nthat exploit to turn off the firewall,\n\n158\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.900\nis that what you had in there?\n\n159\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.840\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, it was just to root it\n\n160\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.367\nand get in, right.\n\n161\n00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nBut could you easily do it that\n\n162\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.750\npoint from there?\n\n163\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI could have definitely-\n\n164\n00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:38.410\n&gt;&gt; You're working hard.\n\n165\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.240\n&gt;&gt; Just like Amanda said, do this with\nthe firewall, open a port or open-\n\n166\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.252\n&gt;&gt; Well in that stop you could have just\n\n167\n00:07:43.252 --> 00:07:43.900\nstopped the service.\n\n168\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.434\n&gt;&gt; Yes I'll stop the service\n&gt;&gt; Real simple, not even complicated,\n\n169\n00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:49.784\njust next stop Windows Firewall, get\nthe equivalent of what the service is and\n\n170\n00:07:49.784 --> 00:07:52.422\nas long as Daniel was already in\nhis root that would have been,\n\n171\n00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:55.154\nalthough we talked about our\nchallenges with typing offline.\n\n172\n00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:56.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But other than having to type it out,\n\n173\n00:07:56.894 --> 00:07:59.431\nDan and I are a little bit\nchallenged when it comes to typing.\n\n174\n00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:01.636\nBut other than that it would\nhave been probably what,\n\n175\n00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:04.971\nmaybe 10 15 seconds to run that exploit\nonce you actually had rooted the box.\n\n176\n00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.103\nAnd we would have turned it off.\n\n177\n00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:06.999\nAnd if it was off and\n\n178\n00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:10.751\nwe didn't know it was off, imagine the\nchaos that could ensue and that Daniel or\n\n179\n00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:14.935\nany bad actor, whoever was engaged in that\nactivity, would've been able to get into.\n\n180\n00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:17.915\nSo this is something just to\nbe aware of and to consider.\n\n181\n00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:20.970\nSo these kind of attacks pose\na bit of a challenge for us.\n\n182\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.220\nLet's just consider talking, let's talk\nabout some integrity attacks, right?\n\n183\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.100\nSo no, we can go back in to me,\nmy pretty face.\n\n184\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.870\nLet's go, look at that.\n\n185\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.010\nBack, there we area.\n\n186\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.527\nLittle delay, my powers probably not\nas [CROSSTALK] today as it needs to be.\n\n187\n00:08:35.527 --> 00:08:39.478\nAll right, so, we don't normally come\nback from being in full-screen and\n\n188\n00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:40.660\nhave to put me back up.\n\n189\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.500\nWe're normally going from here,\nthis way and going back into the machine.\n\n190\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.130\nSo I can understand where the signals may\nnot have translated properly alright so\n\n191\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.320\nintegrity attacks right?\n\n192\n00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.750\nLet's talk about integrity attacks,\n\n193\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.660\nwhen we think about integrity\nwhat do we think about?\n\n194\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.690\nI think about integrity as being the\nability to specify that information has\n\n195\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.920\nnot been changed or\nmodified without consent or\n\n196\n00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.230\napproval, typically of the data owner and\nthe data custodian, right?\n\n197\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.240\nMore often than not.\n\n198\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.490\nSo we talk a lot about\ninjection attacks in this area.\n\n199\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.960\nModifying data in some way\nwith hopefully success, but\n\n200\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.720\nwithout knowledge is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n201\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.740\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n202\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.900\nThings like data frame\ninjection may come up here.\n\n203\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:24.150\nWEP injection, IV replay, bit flipping,\nall sorts of different stuff can go on.\n\n204\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.330\nWhen we're injecting,\nwe're taking malformed data,\n\n205\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.140\npackets of some kind that probably\nwe've crafted somewhere, and\n\n206\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.420\nwe're using them and putting them into\nthe datastream to our ends, our purpose.\n\n207\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.600\nWe're trying to spoof,\n\n208\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.810\nwe're trying to masquerade,\nwe're trying to session hijack.\n\n209\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.010\nWe're trying to root or take control.\n\n210\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.530\nThere are all of these outcomes\nwe may be looking for.\n\n211\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.570\nBut whatever it is, we're gonna take stuff\nthat normally would be done a certain way,\n\n212\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.150\nmodify it under our\ncontrollers of that actor.\n\n213\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.220\nThe stuff is the dataframes,\nright, the data we wanna inject.\n\n214\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.610\nWe're then gonna seek to take over\ncontrol of a network connection.\n\n215\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.730\nWe're gonna insert our data, hoping to\ngain advantage without being discovered.\n\n216\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.670\nThis is essentially what the thought\nprocess is with regards to\n\n217\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.690\ninjection attacks.\n\n218\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.540\nWhether we do data frame injection,\nWEP injection,\n\n219\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.870\nWEP injection is the methodology\ntypically used to crack WEP.\n\n220\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.460\nWhatever it maybe,\nthis is what we're gonna do now how\n\n221\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.015\nthe logical question would\nbe well Well great, Adam.\n\n222\n00:10:18.015 --> 00:10:20.485\nThat's cool but you know, what\nessentially do we do, to figure that out?\n\n223\n00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:23.415\nWell, use what are called replay attacks,\nmore often than not.\n\n224\n00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:27.015\nWe're gonna capture live data,\nusing a variety of mechanisms.\n\n225\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:28.995\nWe've shown you how we can\ndo network monitoring.\n\n226\n00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.345\nIt's not real tough to do.\n\n227\n00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:31.805\nWe capture those frames.\n\n228\n00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:34.815\nI've shown you how to edit data frames,\nusing hex editors.\n\n229\n00:10:34.815 --> 00:10:37.295\nI've shown you how to look at live data,\n\n230\n00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:41.260\nin the stream as we capture it Figure out\nwhat actual packets have data in them.\n\n231\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.360\nAnd I actually even\nshowed you raw live data.\n\n232\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.180\nWe took a look at that\nin one of our demos.\n\n233\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.465\nSo the reality is we've shown you all\nthe moving parts and pieces, right?\n\n234\n00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:49.690\n[LAUGH] In various episodes.\n\n235\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.730\nAll you need to do is stitch that\ntogether, capture that data,\n\n236\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.700\nthen go in and modify it, right?\n\n237\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.810\nSo it essentially suits your purpose.\n\n238\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.090\nSo, instead of the Mac address from\nthe machine that it really was sent from,\n\n239\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.960\nmaybe you wanna spoof that Mac address,\n\n240\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.430\nmaybe the IP needs to be changed,\nmaybe you wanna change the payload.\n\n241\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.071\nDo you wanna add in the exploit code like\nDaniel was suggesting one of our prior\n\n242\n00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:10.640\nepisodes?\n\n243\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.994\nThis show code that we'd refer to\nin certain times in some of our\n\n244\n00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:17.750\nepisodes that he wrote and\ncould be used to exploit a machine, right.\n\n245\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.654\nAnd, by the way, Daniel was selling that,\nright, autographed copies, 5.95 a piece.\n\n246\n00:11:21.654 --> 00:11:23.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just in time for the holidays,\n\n247\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.250\nright, you too can have a stocking stuffer\nthat'll let you root a machine, all right.\n\n248\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.950\nSo the reality is we can easily do this,\nno big deal.\n\n249\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.810\nSo we're gonna talk about replay attacks,\nwe'll capture initialization vectors,\n\n250\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:41.200\nIV replays, we'll capture extensible\nauthentication, EAP replay attacks.\n\n251\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.740\nRadius replay,\nwe'll capture radius packets.\n\n252\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.820\nAny and all of these may occur\nwith regards to integrity.\n\n253\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.890\nWhat about bit flipping?\n\n254\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.680\nRight, we often hear about that.\n\n255\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.590\nYou ever play, just random aside by\nthe way, just so you know it's coming.\n\n256\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.200\n&gt;&gt; Here it comes.\n&gt;&gt; When you were a kid you ever play,\n\n257\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.708\nremember playing tiddlywinks.\n\n258\n00:11:55.708 --> 00:11:57.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n259\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.320\n&gt;&gt; I know, these days I don't know maybe\nit's me but you know, you have kids right,\n\n260\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.230\nthey're younger of course than mine,\nyou have kids.\n\n261\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.330\nI have older kids than Daniel's,\nbut when I was a kid,\n\n262\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.560\nwhen you were a kid too it sounds like,\nyou have these kind of games right?\n\n263\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.190\nI said something like tiddlywinks to one\nof my kids recently and they looked at me\n\n264\n00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.565\nlike I was talking about a pay phone\nin a booth, we had that conversation.\n\n265\n00:12:15.565 --> 00:12:18.559\nWhat the hell you had to stop on the side\nof the road and get out of the car and\n\n266\n00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:20.520\ngo into a glass booth and\nmake a phone call?\n\n267\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.380\nHow does that work?\n\n268\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.040\n&gt;&gt; What savage world did you live in?\n\n269\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.590\n&gt;&gt; You know they look at you like you're\nfrom another planet it just doesn't make\n\n270\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.460\nsense\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n271\n00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.750\nif you've never played tiddlywinks,\nawesome game.\n\n272\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.680\nYou should definitely go play,\nand figure out how to do that.\n\n273\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.222\nIt's hours of fun, and\nyou can play by yourself.\n\n274\n00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:34.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n275\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.360\n&gt;&gt; You don't even need anybody.\n\n276\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.850\nAnd I'm convinced actually,\nall kidding aside,\n\n277\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.040\na certain generation grew up playing\ntiddlywinks, and then at a certain point,\n\n278\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.050\nthey got older, they learned that\nthey could actually go out socially,\n\n279\n00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.910\nhave drinks, and have fun, and\nthat's how quarters was invented.\n\n280\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.010\nBecause I think they knew about\ntiddlywinks, and then ultimately pong and\n\n281\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.970\nquarters, and all those drinking games you\nlearn in college came from tiddlywinks.\n\n282\n00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.180\nSo we still play them, but\n\n283\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.910\nwe just don't attribute them to\nthe fact that they came from there.\n\n284\n00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.110\n&gt;&gt; We just adulted them, right?\n\n285\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.610\nYeah, that's it.\n\n286\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm convinced,\nafter years of hard core study and\n\n287\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.060\nmany nights pondering this, that quarters\nactually comes from tiddlywinks.\n\n288\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.890\nI'm going with that.\n\n289\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to have to\nget behind that theory.\n\n290\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking that's the case.\n\n291\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.640\nSo we should bring that back,\nI think that's cool.\n\n292\n00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.200\nAll right, so anyway, bit flipping.\n\n293\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.355\nThis is where we attempt to monkey\naround with the payload portion\n\n294\n00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:20.355\nof a frame modifying the packets.\n\n295\n00:13:20.355 --> 00:13:22.185\nWe've kind of been talking\nabout that methodology.\n\n296\n00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:24.705\nAnother name for what we just talked\nabout is called bit flipping.\n\n297\n00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:27.265\nJust yet\nanother way of seeking these tasks.\n\n298\n00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.487\nWhat about confidentiality as a category?\n\n299\n00:13:29.487 --> 00:13:31.567\nWhen we define confidentiality,\n\n300\n00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:34.107\nwe're thinking about keeping\ngood data away from bad people.\n\n301\n00:13:34.107 --> 00:13:35.947\nHiding the data, using, typically,\n\n302\n00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:39.247\nencryption more often than not,\nto prevent people from seeing it.\n\n303\n00:13:39.247 --> 00:13:42.843\nSo how do we attack these\nkinds of mechanisms?\n\n304\n00:13:42.843 --> 00:13:46.143\nEavesdropping and sniffing and snooping,\nall these kinds of mechanisms and\n\n305\n00:13:46.143 --> 00:13:47.943\nmethodologies we've talked about before.\n\n306\n00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:50.723\nThis is just traffic analysis,\nlet's just call it what it is, right?\n\n307\n00:13:50.723 --> 00:13:52.993\nWe're pulling bits out of the data stream.\n\n308\n00:13:52.993 --> 00:13:55.143\nWe're trying to decode\nthem if they're encrypted.\n\n309\n00:13:55.143 --> 00:13:58.490\nWe're trying to look at them I would\ntry and understand what's there and\n\n310\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.250\nthen gain an advantage.\n\n311\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.550\nWhether it's a hash so we can understand\nthe password, whether it is a password in\n\n312\n00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.860\nthe clear, whether it's data that may\ngive us the configuration of a system,\n\n313\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.560\nor whatever it may be.\n\n314\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.800\nAn IP address, a mac address or\nwhatever it is.\n\n315\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.010\nEavesdropping, sniffing,\nsnooping, you name it.\n\n316\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.900\nIt gives us the ability to pull all\nthat data together and interact with it.\n\n317\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.240\nTraffic analysis,\nanother word for this as well.\n\n318\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.030\nWhat about things like,\ncracking the web key?\n\n319\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.110\nWe've talked about the fact\nthat we could do that repeating\n\n320\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.940\nsystem use of keys over time.\n\n321\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.160\nAny kind of pattern with regards to\nencryption is deadly and all we need to do\n\n322\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.430\nis capture enough traffic and then have\nevery option available to us essentially.\n\n323\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.270\nEvery possible permutation of the key and\nit's only a matter of time.\n\n324\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.810\nAnd this is exactly what we do,\nit's a numbers game, essentially.\n\n325\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.850\nYou ever play, another random aside\nby the way, and game related.\n\n326\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.530\nWe'll go with a game theme\nthis particular discussion.\n\n327\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.280\nSo you ever played Concentration\nwhen you were a kid?\n\n328\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.680\n&gt;&gt; Remind me what Concentration is again.\n\n329\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.150\n&gt;&gt; So Concentration would be basically\nthe idea of, it's like a matching game.\n\n330\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.080\nYou put the cards down, face down.\n\n331\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.200\nIt's like a deck of cards.\n\n332\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.870\nYou would put them down, just obviously\nin random order, you would shuffle them\n\n333\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.570\ncuz it's not fun if you don't shuffle\nthem, and it's easy to match, right?\n\n334\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.830\nLook I got another one right?\n\n335\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.300\nBut you would randomly shuffle them,\nput them down, face down.\n\n336\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.750\nI'll lay out the whole deck, and\nyou would randomly just pull two cards up,\n\n337\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.650\ntrying to figure yeah,\nlook I got a queen and a ten.\n\n338\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.230\nAnd you'd have to remember where they\nwere and then try it again, right?\n\n339\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.338\nAnd then eventually they to match them up.\n\n340\n00:15:20.338 --> 00:15:23.080\nSo at least what we call I\ngrew up as concentration.\n\n341\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.460\nSometimes they call it a 52-card\npick-up if somebody got pissed and\n\n342\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.290\nthrew them up in the air.\n\n343\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.700\nThen you played Concentration.\n\n344\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.950\nBut if you've played Concentration or\nremember the game,\n\n345\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.660\nit's essentially cracking a web\nkey is essentially like that.\n\n346\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.900\nIt's basically that idea,\nhow many different options,\n\n347\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.890\nhow many keys do I have?\n\n348\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.052\nWell I have a limited pool\nwe've established, right?\n\n349\n00:15:40.052 --> 00:15:42.580\nA 40-bit key,\nthere's not a lot of options there.\n\n350\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.798\nWe're talking about a number that's\nrealistic and reasonable and\n\n351\n00:15:45.798 --> 00:15:49.638\nthat if we see enough traffic those\nkeys will repeat every 25,000 frames,\n\n352\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:51.857\nevery 100,000 frames whatever it is.\n\n353\n00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:56.489\nIf we capture a 100,000 frames of\ndata we've got every possible key,\n\n354\n00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:00.549\nevery permentation now all we need\nto do is register all those keys,\n\n355\n00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:05.466\nuse every key to crack against every data\nbit or every packet that's encrypted and\n\n356\n00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:06.842\nwe have every option.\n\n357\n00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.206\nHow hard it is for a computer to say okay,\nI've 100,000 options over here,\n\n358\n00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.175\nI'm going to try everyone\ntill I get a match, and\n\n359\n00:16:12.175 --> 00:16:14.440\nI'm going to try the next\nset you just keep going.\n\n360\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.573\nAnd we encrypt everything and\ndecrypt everything in real time,\n\n361\n00:16:16.573 --> 00:16:19.120\ncomputers [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Rid of that [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.960\n&gt;&gt; They are and\n\n363\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.730\nthat's obviously one of the reasons\nthat we use them for this kind of stuff.\n\n364\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.790\nBecause people,\n\n365\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.340\nwhile we couldn't farely do this kind of\nwork, it would just take a lot longer.\n\n366\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.970\nIts going to take us a long time to match,\nwhere as a computer does nothing but\n\n367\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.920\njust say yeah, i just got to find those\nbits and i have to keep going untill I do.\n\n368\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.060\nEvil twin AP, this is a cool one.\n\n369\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.900\nVery cool name for a basic concept,\nwe setup a road access point and\n\n370\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.730\nget you to connect to it, that's what\nthe evil twin is called, its just\n\n371\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.690\ngoing to mimic or mirror the real access\npoints, its going to be made to look and\n\n372\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.480\nfeel LIke the real access point,\nbut it's essentially just not that.\n\n373\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.390\nIt's something else.\n\n374\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.562\nSpeaking of which, let's actually, give\nme just half a second before we do this.\n\n375\n00:16:57.562 --> 00:16:59.380\nWant to take in and\n\n376\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.930\nshow you how we may actually be able\nto go in and do something like this.\n\n377\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:04.720\nCan we go to our machine?\n\n378\n00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.700\nJust had to click through and,\ncan we go full strength?\n\n379\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.100\nHow to set up the demo real quick.\n\n380\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.280\nWe got this cool site that we got to\ngive credit where credit's due because\n\n381\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.340\nyou said, hey,\nI think he knows how to do this.\n\n382\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.910\nBut you didn't remember\nwhat it was neither.\n\n383\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.840\nI didn't know about it.\n\n384\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.400\nAnd Ronnie one of our hosts here\nat ITPro TV, actually said, yeah,\n\n385\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.580\nthis is the site you go to,\nso thank you Ronnie.\n\n386\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.490\nWe're going to dedicate\nthis demo to Ronnie.\n\n387\n00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:28.780\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, this is all for you my friend.\n\n389\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.892\n&gt;&gt; In loving memory of.\n\n390\n00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:31.691\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if goes horribly, well, guess what?\n\n391\n00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:32.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:33.737\nFollow Ronnie's.\n&gt;&gt; Call Ronnie and let him know.\n\n393\n00:17:33.737 --> 00:17:37.097\nNo, but all kidding aside, Ronnie told us\nabout this really cool site that he uses\n\n394\n00:17:37.097 --> 00:17:39.401\nand as you said,\nI guess he's used on some other shows.\n\n395\n00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:42.421\nYou may have even seen him do it\nif you watched those episodes.\n\n396\n00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:47.208\nBut it's called UI.linksys.com, and\nit's a site that essentially just has\n\n397\n00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:51.990\nsimulators up for all the Linksys\nswitches, routers, things like that.\n\n398\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.540\nAnd you could go in and\nyou could take a look at the interface.\n\n399\n00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.610\nSo I thought it would be cool if we\njust clicked through on one of them,\n\n400\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.300\na typical one that many\nof us may see at home.\n\n401\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.972\nAnd just going to the latest\nversion that's up there, so 802.05.\n\n402\n00:18:04.972 --> 00:18:07.509\nAnd we could see a wireless\nbroadband router,\n\n403\n00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:10.770\nand we actually have the interface,\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n404\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.270\nWe can play with it, and\nwhat we can do as a result of that\n\n405\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.250\nis we could actually go and look at some\nof the settings, so it's kinda cool.\n\n406\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.770\nSo what I'm going to do is just walk\nyou through a couple of things that\n\n407\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.910\nyou may just want to know about here,\nright?\n\n408\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.730\nWhat we can see is we have\nthings like DHCP server.\n\n409\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.080\nWe have our time zone.\n\n410\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.170\nAs an investigator, it would be a good\nidea for us to know about this.\n\n411\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.270\nAnd obviously, to be aware of this.\n\n412\n00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.885\nAnd I'm just going to quickly,\nwhile we're talking, by the way.\n\n413\n00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:36.715\nJust go in and I'm just going to set up.\n\n414\n00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:40.655\nI forgot to launch zoom in, so let me just\ndo that second zoom in as I have been\n\n415\n00:18:40.655 --> 00:18:44.252\ndoing and showing you all of those\nfeatures becayse I'm sure you going\n\n416\n00:18:44.252 --> 00:18:48.620\nto like it a lot better when you could see\nit up close so we just get that running.\n\n417\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.960\nSo we restarted the machine\nin between our discussions.\n\n418\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.350\nThere we go, look at that,\nnow you can actually see and so\n\n419\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.050\nwe could see we've got\nthe DHCP server settings.\n\n420\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.850\nNow wouldn't it be good for\n\n421\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.070\nus when we investigate the system if this\nwas a real device we wanted to look at.\n\n422\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.150\nWould it be good for\nus to know those settings Yeah,\n\n423\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.360\nwe wanna take a record of that.\n\n424\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.300\nShould we know the time zone?\n\n425\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.950\nOf course.\n\n426\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.650\nWe've talked about time offsets and\nthe value of NTP in other episodes.\n\n427\n00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.790\nYou want to know all that.\n\n428\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.350\nWe've got our IP addressing.\n\n429\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.490\nWe've got our subnet mask, right?\n\n430\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.880\nWe've got all that kind of stuff.\n\n431\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.500\nSo we have that.\n\n432\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.246\nBut then if we scroll up here, what we're\ngoing to do is come in under wireless.\n\n433\n00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:27.160\nAnd we're going to take a look at the fact\nthat we have our wireless network name,\n\n434\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.430\nour SSID or SSID.\n\n435\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.490\nSo we can see that.\n\n436\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.750\nWe've got our channel there.\n\n437\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.710\nWe've got it set to broadcast.\n\n438\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.920\nWould we wanna stealth this\ndevice at some point and\n\n439\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.385\nmaybe hide it from our neighbors?\n\n440\n00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.300\nBecause we don't like giving out\nfree wireless we would do this,\n\n441\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.550\nwe would simply disable SSID broadcasting.\n\n442\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.070\nThat will be one of the things we\ntalked about in a prior episode.\n\n443\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.290\nAnd we could actually go in and\nwe could specify depending on the device,\n\n444\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:53.410\nwhether it's 802.11B dot G or whatever it\nmay be based on what the device supports.\n\n445\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.110\nAnd we could typically do that with the\nnetwork mode, so we could see that there.\n\n446\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.240\nWe also could go in,\ngo to wireless security.\n\n447\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.080\nJust kind of point to that real quick,\nso you can see where that is.\n\n448\n00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.550\nNotice the security mode\nset to WPA personal.\n\n449\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.420\nWe could pull that down and\nprobably set that to WEP.\n\n450\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.720\nDepending on the device, the algorithm\nthere, TKIP, we may set that to AES.\n\n451\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.590\nThe shared key for WPA,\n1234567890, by default.\n\n452\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.720\nObviously clearly want to modify that.\n\n453\n00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.210\nAnd then you could see\nthe group key renewal.\n\n454\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.410\nEvery 3600 seconds, right,\nwe're renewing the key.\n\n455\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.690\nWhich means 60 seconds to a minute,\n60 minutes to an hour.\n\n456\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.840\nOnce an hour, we're renewing that key.\n\n457\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.110\nNow that may or may not be good enough,\ndepending on the volume of traffic.\n\n458\n00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.390\nWe were talking about this, right?\n\n459\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.530\nThe key may need to be refreshed sooner\nbecause we don't want the same key sitting\n\n460\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.070\nout there for\nvery long because somebody may find it.\n\n461\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.130\nBut if we're doing such a high volume\nof traffic, and we renew it so\n\n462\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.280\nfrequently we may run out of keys,\nthat could also be a challenge.\n\n463\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.570\nSo we have to balance that but\nyeah let's take a look.\n\n464\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.290\nWe do see WEP is there.\n\n465\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.000\nWPA2 Enterprise, Personal,\nthings like that, RADIUS and WEP.\n\n466\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.030\nSo we would wanna obviously make\nthe appropriate choices here\n\n467\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.060\nDon't be that person that uses WEP.\n\n468\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.690\nAs we've talked about,\nTKIP and AES are there, right?\n\n469\n00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.690\nSo we can see the different\nprotocols being used.\n\n470\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.290\nAES is actually AES-CCMP.\n\n471\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.600\nThat's the formal name for the protocol or\nthe algorithm when we use it in wireless,\n\n472\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.870\nbut you just see it referred\nto typically as AES.\n\n473\n00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.100\nWe don't actually write\nthe whole thing out.\n\n474\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.280\nBut just so you know, so we could do that.\n\n475\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.370\nI we were gonna do a little MAC\nfiltering and enable the MAC filter.\n\n476\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.940\nLet's just turn that on.\n\n477\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.820\nAnd then we could go in and\nedit our MAC list.\n\n478\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.740\nJust move this over so\nyou could see that while we're doing that.\n\n479\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.790\nYou could see that all I\ndo is enable MAC filtering.\n\n480\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.660\nAnd we talked about using MAC filtering,\nright?\n\n481\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.080\nWe can just go in and\nadd the MAC addresses in there.\n\n482\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:39.990\nNow obviously,\n\n483\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.740\nif we're going to do this we have to\nknow what the MAC addresses are, right?\n\n484\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.450\nAnd then put them in.\n\n485\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.080\nAnd then this blocks anybody\nelse from getting in.\n\n486\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.980\nAgain, as an investigator we'd wanna be\nwalking through here looking at this,\n\n487\n00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.830\ncapturing this information\nWould be important.\n\n488\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.510\nWhat about advanced wireless settings?\n\n489\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.200\nWell, this is where we get into some\nof the stuff that would be helpful\n\n490\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.100\nlike looking at our Beacon Interval,\nlooking at our AP Isolation,\n\n491\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.740\nlooking at fragmentation.\n\n492\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.000\nLooking at authentication type.\n\n493\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.060\nYou know this is out beyond some of\nthe stuff we're doing, this is not a,\n\n494\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.648\nCWNA wireless discussion.\n\n495\n00:22:10.648 --> 00:22:12.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that.\n\n496\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.360\nBut my point is, there's a lot of detail,\n\n497\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.380\na lot of settings in here, that as an\ninvestigator we'd have to drill into this.\n\n498\n00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.760\nWe've talked about it and look at it.\n\n499\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.680\nTo understand the configuration\nof the wireless device right?\n\n500\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.250\nUnderneath security right.\n\n501\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.180\nSomething simple as going in and\n\n502\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.020\nlooking at things like blocking\nanonymous Internet requests.\n\n503\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.510\nAnd or doing redirects and\nadding and stuff like that.\n\n504\n00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.260\nSo yeah, there's a lot of stuff that\nwe look at here on the firewall,\n\n505\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.630\non the VPN side with\naccess restrictions right?\n\n506\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.980\nWe probably want to go in and take a look\nat whether or not we were enabling and\n\n507\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.120\nallowing a list of authorized PCs,\nperhaps time restrictions from the place.\n\n508\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.320\nSo they call temporal access control.\n\n509\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.860\nBeing able to block access\nduring certain times.\n\n510\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.490\nYou know, secretly every so often I'll do\nthis to my kids when they piss me off.\n\n511\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.640\nSo I'll go in and I'll just reprogram\nthe device at home so they can't connect.\n\n512\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.025\nIt's not working, what's wrong.\n\n513\n00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:05.802\n[CROSSTALK] I don't know what happened.\n\n514\n00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.183\nAll of a sudden, hey, it's 8 o'clock,\nyou should be able to get on,\n\n515\n00:23:08.183 --> 00:23:09.520\nI'm not sure why.\n\n516\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.670\nSo just be wary, right?\n\n517\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.090\nYou can obviously mess around in here.\n\n518\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.200\nBut you get the idea.\n\n519\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.670\nSo this kind of a site is actually\npretty cool because it shows you\n\n520\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.870\nall these different devices.\n\n521\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.360\nNow, is it 100% up to date,\nis it going to have everything?\n\n522\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.460\nNo, it's gonna only obviously have\nLinksys related gear and technology.\n\n523\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.510\nBut do other vendors have sites like this?\n\n524\n00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.910\nI would guess they probably do.\n\n525\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.020\nBut I can tell you for a fact that if\nyou go out and look, you may find one.\n\n526\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.300\nSo, it just may be interesting for you to\ntake a look and see what's going on there.\n\n527\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.150\nSo this is how we would get into and\n\n528\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.750\nfigure out what some of\nthese attacks may be.\n\n529\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.250\nThings like man in the middle attacks\nwere surreptitiously eavesdropping,\n\n530\n00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.450\nsnooping on traffic, recording it.\n\n531\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.530\nAnd then remember, for passively\ndoing that, we're just listening and\n\n532\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.675\nmonitoring as we've shown\nyou in a prior episode.\n\n533\n00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:51.443\nIf we're gonna go live and\nactually try to hack,\n\n534\n00:23:51.443 --> 00:23:56.037\nwe're going to actively engage in probably\na session hijack event where we knock\n\n535\n00:23:56.037 --> 00:23:58.757\nsomebody offline and\ntake over their session.\n\n536\n00:23:58.757 --> 00:24:01.247\nThat would be the outcome\nof that session hijacking.\n\n537\n00:24:01.247 --> 00:24:02.508\nWould be another way to do this.\n\n538\n00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:05.630\nMasquerading, we may just spoof and\npretend to be somebody we're not.\n\n539\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.018\nAnd then a honey pot access subpoint\nattack, where we may actually set up honey\n\n540\n00:24:10.018 --> 00:24:13.758\npots, or the bad actor may,\ntricking us into connecting to them.\n\n541\n00:24:13.758 --> 00:24:16.275\nWe've talked about the value of\nhoney pots in prior episodes.\n\n542\n00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:19.595\nAnd then if they do that,\nwe may be fooled into connecting or\n\n543\n00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:22.805\nmay get fooled into using the system when,\nin fact, it's not really legitimate.\n\n544\n00:24:22.805 --> 00:24:24.625\nSo we have to be aware of that as well.\n\n545\n00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.065\nWhat about availability attacks, right?\n\n546\n00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:27.482\nJust knocking out the system.\n\n547\n00:24:27.482 --> 00:24:31.802\nDenial of service, distributed denial\nof service, doing flooding attacks.\n\n548\n00:24:31.802 --> 00:24:36.082\nBeacon flooding, authentication flooding,\ndisassociation attacks,\n\n549\n00:24:36.082 --> 00:24:38.452\nwhere we get people to disassociate\nfrom the access point.\n\n550\n00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:39.822\nHow about just power off?\n\n551\n00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:43.722\nWe send a power reset command, right,\nto the device, powering it down,\n\n552\n00:24:43.722 --> 00:24:45.532\ndropping all the active connections.\n\n553\n00:24:45.532 --> 00:24:46.432\nWouldn't be hard to do.\n\n554\n00:24:46.432 --> 00:24:50.040\nOr we send it to the client,\nwe could do that as well.\n\n555\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.370\nJust have the client ignore the wireless\naccess connection and reset the signal, or\n\n556\n00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.000\nreset the connection router,\nand it drops the connection.\n\n557\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.370\nSo there's a lot of different\nways we could attack the system.\n\n558\n00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.840\nSo just wanna think about that,\nthings like ARP cache poisoning.\n\n559\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.760\nCould be used where we get in and\nwe put bad information or bad entries into\n\n560\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.090\nthe ARC cache, the IP and Mac address,\ntranslation association, we could do that.\n\n561\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.240\nHow about things like\nauthentication attacks?\n\n562\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.040\nWe could go in and steal someone's\ncredentials and authenticate.\n\n563\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.220\nWe showed you just now on the demo where\nwe have the Mac address control list\n\n564\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.380\nthat we could take on the identity\nof somebody using their Mac address.\n\n565\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.250\nWe could crack the keys\nassociated with authentication.\n\n566\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.240\nWe could use a dictionary brute\nforce attack, we talked about that.\n\n567\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.300\nActually we demonstrated that for\nyou in the password cracking area.\n\n568\n00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.250\nWe could guess the keys,\njust get lucky and do that.\n\n569\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.399\nIf that happens, by the way,\nand I do get lucky,\n\n570\n00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:42.766\nI'm actually quitting everything I do,\nand I'm buying a lottery ticket.\n\n571\n00:25:42.766 --> 00:25:44.824\nAnd I'm retiring to that island\nwe keep talking about, and\n\n572\n00:25:44.824 --> 00:25:47.799\nI'm gonna set up the first Hurricane Pizza\nfranchise, that's what I'm doing.\n\n573\n00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:48.676\n&gt;&gt; I'll be right there next to you.\n\n574\n00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:51.256\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's me,\n\n575\n00:25:51.256 --> 00:25:54.030\nthat's only if I get lucky\nenough to guess passwords.\n\n576\n00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:54.790\nHasn't happened yet.\n\n577\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.310\nAnd as you can see, more white,\nless dark on the face.\n\n578\n00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.240\nTime continues to march on, [LAUGH] right?\n\n579\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.400\nSo all these different things can be done,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n580\n00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.490\nWe've talked about the methodology\nwith regards to how we may go in and\n\n581\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.700\ndeal with wireless crime\nscene investigation.\n\n582\n00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.040\nAnd I started rattling off a lot\nof the steps in the methodology.\n\n583\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.140\nAnd I likened it to the fact that,\nhey, by the way,\n\n584\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.210\nit's essentially the same methodology\nwe use for everything else that we do.\n\n585\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.080\nWhat I wanted to do was show you\none aspect of this methodology\n\n586\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.240\non the screen here.\n\n587\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.960\nI wanted to show you how we actually,\nat the back end of it,\n\n588\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.000\nhow we report in Document\nwhat we're doing.\n\n589\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.960\nAnd actually it's a couple of steps,\nbecause during the methodology or\n\n590\n00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.590\nin the steps involved, we're gonna\nactually have to document what we find,\n\n591\n00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.432\nmap everything out.\n\n592\n00:26:37.432 --> 00:26:40.600\nAnd we've talked about this from\nthe forensics perspective of, hey,\n\n593\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.040\ntake pictures.\n\n594\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.740\nMake sure everybody knows where\neverything was and how it was connected.\n\n595\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.930\nThat's all important.\n\n596\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.050\nBut then how do you actually translate\nthat into a report at the end of the day?\n\n597\n00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.428\nYou use a tool something like this,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n598\n00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:53.960\nSo we can go full screen for\njust a minute, let's take a look.\n\n599\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.230\nThis tool is e-draw\nnetwork diagramming tool.\n\n600\n00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.440\nRight, there's many of these tools\nout there, Network View, there\n\n601\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.560\nis just all these different ones, Visio,\nwhere that can be used for the same thing.\n\n602\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.520\nIt doesn't matter what tool you use,\nbut the idea is that it's a drag and\n\n603\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.710\ndrop interface.\n\n604\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.100\nYou can build out these pictures and\nthese frames.\n\n605\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.710\nI used a pre-made diagram that was just\na standard template for Ethernet LAN, and\n\n606\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.320\nI put out some additional items here.\n\n607\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.370\nSo we've got some machines, right?\n\n608\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:25.560\nAnd we got some IP addresses that\nare there if we just zoom in real quick.\n\n609\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.700\nYou can kinda see the IP\nrange that we put in there.\n\n610\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.530\nWe got a little Ethernet connection,\ngot a router and a firewall.\n\n611\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:38.880\nGot our Internet out over there, got the\ndepartment server, the printer, all that.\n\n612\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.127\nAnd obviously, what we would\ndo is add in some information,\n\n613\n00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:47.392\nI added in just from the field\nselector over here on the left.\n\n614\n00:27:47.392 --> 00:27:52.324\nI brought in a wireless router, brought\nin a little connectivity lightening bolt,\n\n615\n00:27:52.324 --> 00:27:56.283\njust linking it to the device connection\npathway to link it to the LAN\n\n616\n00:27:56.283 --> 00:27:57.410\non the wired side.\n\n617\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.100\nSo we can see that there's connectivity.\n\n618\n00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.120\nAs an investigator, right,\n\n619\n00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.374\nwe've gotta be able to accurately\nreproduce all of the things we find, or\n\n620\n00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:09.420\nall the things we've talked about, or\nall the things that we know were there.\n\n621\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.940\nAnd by linking the wireless\nrouter into the LAN and\n\n622\n00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.540\nthen showing that there's a pathway, I've\nestablished that there was connectivity,\n\n623\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.130\nor at least potential anyway, right?\n\n624\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.010\nConnectivity to this device, and\n\n625\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.240\nas a result of that,\nI could then make some case notes, right?\n\n626\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.510\nAnd so literally, I could drop in a text\nbox, right, and do something like this.\n\n627\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.286\nSo let's just say we go to text here,\ngo to the text tool,\n\n628\n00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:34.585\ndraw out a little box right there.\n\n629\n00:28:34.585 --> 00:28:38.836\nI can make some notes that say,\nthis was the configuration, and\n\n630\n00:28:38.836 --> 00:28:41.840\nhere's maybe a connection\nto the file name.\n\n631\n00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.940\nSo the downloaded config\nwould be router1.txt.\n\n632\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.485\nSo in the report,\nI could actually reference the file,\n\n633\n00:28:48.485 --> 00:28:49.846\ncreate an attachment for it.\n\n634\n00:28:49.846 --> 00:28:53.876\nBut in the diagram, I could tell somebody\nwho looks at it, this is what I found, and\n\n635\n00:28:53.876 --> 00:28:55.620\nthis is the detailed information.\n\n636\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.470\nI would put that in there.\n\n637\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:01.468\nSo something like this,\nright, Case id, and\n\n638\n00:29:01.468 --> 00:29:04.424\nwe would do 5467-2.\n\n639\n00:29:04.424 --> 00:29:11.320\nAnd then something like Device id,\nunique identifier,\n\n640\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.492\n67tred, and then config file, right,\n\n641\n00:29:16.492 --> 00:29:22.480\nwould be route1.txt or\nsomething like that.\n\n642\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.910\nAnd by just doing that and having those\nnotes, they may be just maneuvering it\n\n643\n00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:32.350\naround just a little bit, and\nmaybe just trying to resize it.\n\n644\n00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.220\nWell, you get the idea, doesn't\nreally matter if I resize it or not.\n\n645\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.140\nBut you get the idea.\n\n646\n00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.785\nBy doing that and\nthen just having that on the diagram,\n\n647\n00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:43.030\nright, you'll have that information\navailable, and as a result,\n\n648\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.670\nwhen somebody looks at the diagram, they\ncould reference that information, track it\n\n649\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.690\nback to the report, and they could look\nat the file and something like that.\n\n650\n00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.180\nSo, yeah, we would essentially\ncreate information maps like this.\n\n651\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.407\nAnd this would help us to\ndocument everything we're doing.\n\n652\n00:29:55.407 --> 00:29:58.249\nAnd so when we think about the\nmethodology, just to review it one more\n\n653\n00:29:58.249 --> 00:30:01.140\ntime with you, we think about step one,\nobtaining a search warrant.\n\n654\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.470\nWe've talked about this and the necessary\nrequirements that you have to go through\n\n655\n00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.210\nthere, the burden of proof around\nevidence, justifiable cause, suspicion,\n\n656\n00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.610\nwhatever it may be.\n\n657\n00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.050\nIdentifying a wireless device or\nwireless devices,\n\n658\n00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.230\nsince we're in the wireless area\nspecifically, would be the focus here.\n\n659\n00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:20.915\nBut more broadly, identifying all of\nthe overlaying details in the crime scene.\n\n660\n00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:22.825\nRemember, this crime\nscene has to be secured,\n\n661\n00:30:22.825 --> 00:30:25.885\nthen we're gonna identify everything, look\nat everything, not touch anything, but\n\n662\n00:30:25.885 --> 00:30:28.095\njust really understand what's\nthere before we do anything else.\n\n663\n00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:30.795\nWe're then gonna document the scene,\nmaintain chain of custody,\n\n664\n00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:32.387\nvery important for us to do that.\n\n665\n00:30:32.387 --> 00:30:36.737\nDetect any wireless connections, so\nin this case, we would start to look for\n\n666\n00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:39.327\nwireless connections that may exist and\ndocument them.\n\n667\n00:30:39.327 --> 00:30:42.237\nNow there's a bunch of tools\nthat can be used to do this, but\n\n668\n00:30:42.237 --> 00:30:45.068\nsomething as simple as, if we can go\nback to the machine for just a minute.\n\n669\n00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:50.198\nIf we just go in here to our,\nand let me just bring up\n\n670\n00:30:50.198 --> 00:30:54.318\nour network connections on Windows 10,\nright, for instance.\n\n671\n00:30:54.318 --> 00:30:58.388\nIf we just come in here on any Windows\ndevice, and go to our WiFi and really just\n\n672\n00:30:58.388 --> 00:31:03.368\ngo in and do connect disconnect,\nI can get a listing of the information.\n\n673\n00:31:03.368 --> 00:31:05.706\nI could see the stuff here,\nshow available networks.\n\n674\n00:31:05.706 --> 00:31:07.972\nSo I can just bring up show\navailable networks, and\n\n675\n00:31:07.972 --> 00:31:10.450\nI can see whatever networks\nmay be available to me.\n\n676\n00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.600\nCould I then capture and\ndocument what's here on this device?\n\n677\n00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.170\nYeah, I would remember, not wanna do\nit on the device I'm investigating, but\n\n678\n00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.280\ncould I do it from another\ndevice in the system?\n\n679\n00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.760\nI would start there,\nwanna see what I find,\n\n680\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.700\ncompare that to what I see on this device.\n\n681\n00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.330\nHey, there's a couple of\nwireless devices here\n\n682\n00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.510\nthat I'm connecting to that\nI don't see on my device.\n\n683\n00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:33.020\nWell, maybe they're not being broadcast,\nthe SSIDs are not there.\n\n684\n00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.360\nMaybe they're Mac filtering.\n\n685\n00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.630\nSo, I can then begin to\nnarrow down my focus and\n\n686\n00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.620\nstart to figure out exactly what's there.\n\n687\n00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.430\nBut I'd have to use a couple\nof different devices or\n\n688\n00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.830\ntools to figure this out, not just simply\nrely on what I see from one device alone.\n\n689\n00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.382\nBecause remember, as we've established,\n\n690\n00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:48.920\nwe may not be getting the accurate\npicture and all the information.\n\n691\n00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.774\nAnd we don't wanna leave something\noff that actually is there and\n\n692\n00:31:51.774 --> 00:31:52.570\nwe're just not aware of it.\n\n693\n00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.030\nThat could be a problem.\n\n694\n00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.293\nSo determine and\ndetect wireless connections,\n\n695\n00:31:56.293 --> 00:31:59.950\nwe then would also wanna detect and\ndetermine the strength of the connection.\n\n696\n00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.052\nIf we can go back for one second,\nso, a little bit here,\n\n697\n00:32:03.052 --> 00:32:05.702\nyou could see those\nlittle radiating signals.\n\n698\n00:32:05.702 --> 00:32:06.351\nThat come out.\n\n699\n00:32:06.351 --> 00:32:09.011\nIt's almost like the thing\nthat goes this way.\n\n700\n00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:11.010\nWe can see, yeah, the strength there.\n\n701\n00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.630\nIt's not a great way to indicate strength.\n\n702\n00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.360\nIt's not reliable per se.\n\n703\n00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.190\nWe would want to use an analysis tool\nthat actually does give us a measure of\n\n704\n00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.807\nbandwidth but this is just gonna give us\nat least a visual indicator to start with.\n\n705\n00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.060\nWe've got one or two or\n\n706\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.460\nthree bars or whatever, gives me\na general idea of what may be there.\n\n707\n00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.780\nSo, we just wanna know that, but obviously\nhaving said that we'd wanna use a tool\n\n708\n00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.940\nthat actually really does map this out.\n\n709\n00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.990\nWe wanna map out the wireless zones and\nhotspots so\n\n710\n00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.330\nwe would use a tool that\nwould lay all of that out.\n\n711\n00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.660\nThen we would go ahead and connect out to\nthe wireless network, see what we're able\n\n712\n00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.220\nto connect to, interrogate the devices,\nexamine, analyze, and recover data.\n\n713\n00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.860\nForensically, it's a data acquisition or\nanalysis.\n\n714\n00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.190\nAnd then ultimately as we just\nshowed you the last step,\n\n715\n00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.600\ndealing with reporting,\ndocument what we find.\n\n716\n00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.490\nThis would be kind of the nine\nsteps in the methodology\n\n717\n00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.890\nthat we often will go through and we just\nwanna remind you of that in this episode.\n\n718\n00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:02.130\nWe've talked about it in a lot of other\nepisodes, but other than substituting\n\n719\n00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.840\nthe word wireless for whatever other\nkinds of data we're acquiring,\n\n720\n00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.620\nhard drive forensics,\nnetwork forensics, printer forensics,\n\n721\n00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.960\ndesktop, we can just go on and on and\non with everything we investigate.\n\n722\n00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.510\nWe're just putting wireless in here\nas another focal point for us.\n\n723\n00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.801\nBut the traditional concepts and\n\n724\n00:33:19.801 --> 00:33:22.070\nthe methodology steps\nare essentially the same, right?\n\n725\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.551\nThey're really not gonna change.\n\n726\n00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.877\n&gt;&gt; Adam, there is a veritable cornucopia\nof different types of attacks.\n\n727\n00:33:27.877 --> 00:33:30.600\n[CROSSTALK] Slide that\ninto our dialogue today.\n\n728\n00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.274\nBut there are just tons of them, just\nmyriads of types of attacks you've walked\n\n729\n00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:39.450\nus through, the ones that we need to\nbe aware of as far as being a CHFI.\n\n730\n00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:43.570\nAnd then of course,\nwhat we need to do with that information,\n\n731\n00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.860\ncan we now take a look at that network,\nmaybe find out what was going on, how was\n\n732\n00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.835\nthe attack perpetrated, and use that to\nthe ends of collecting the truth, right?\n\n733\n00:33:52.835 --> 00:33:53.915\nWe've been talking about that.\n\n734\n00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:55.055\n&gt;&gt; Seek the truth.\n&gt;&gt; All throughout this.\n\n735\n00:33:55.055 --> 00:33:57.015\nSeek that truth,\nthe truth is out there, right?\n\n736\n00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:57.945\n&gt;&gt; Truth will set you free.\n\n737\n00:33:57.945 --> 00:33:59.935\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n[LAUGH] it will set you free.\n\n738\n00:33:59.935 --> 00:34:02.927\nThat being said, looks like we've\nrun out of time for wireless,\n\n739\n00:34:02.927 --> 00:34:05.977\nbut we'd definitely give\nyou a big bone to chew on.\n\n740\n00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:08.737\nSo, jump back,\nwe got two episodes on wireless.\n\n741\n00:34:08.737 --> 00:34:09.897\nYou're gonna need to walk over that.\n\n742\n00:34:09.897 --> 00:34:13.017\nKnow the different standards, know\nthe different types of encryptions, and\n\n743\n00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:14.417\nknow the different types of attacks and\n\n744\n00:34:14.417 --> 00:34:17.447\nthen what to do with that\ninformation once you have it.\n\n745\n00:34:17.447 --> 00:34:19.437\nBeing said, it's time for us to sign off.\n\n746\n00:34:19.437 --> 00:34:20.937\nThank you so much for joining us today.\n\n747\n00:34:20.937 --> 00:34:22.257\nAdam, thanks for joining us as well.\n\n748\n00:34:22.257 -->

great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.080\nIn today's episode, we are continuing\non with more in our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920\nAnd of course, joining us back in the\nstudio yet again is our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.880\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.630\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.380\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.270\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.140\nIt is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.530\nYou ever have a deja vu moment?\n\n15\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI know it's like we've done this before.\n\n16\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Almost like you feel like you've\nbeen here before, doing the same thing.\n\n17\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.450\nNot that we have done that, of course.\n\n18\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is not deja vu.\n\n19\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.710\nIt is live.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n21\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.075\nlet's talk a little bit about web.\n\n22\n00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.910\nWeb-related infrastructure,\nweb-related services.\n\n23\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.200\nEverything you ever wanted\nto know about the web and-\n\n24\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.650\n&gt;&gt; and more.\n\n25\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.175\n&gt;&gt; more.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:52.600\n&gt;&gt; And that is everything you want to\n\n27\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.409\nknow and\nwe are done talking about the web.\n\n28\n00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.244\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for joining us.\n\n29\n00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:55.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n30\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.310\nlets talk a little bit about how\na CHFI would look at the web.\n\n31\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.255\nYou know when we think about the the web,\nwhat we have to remember and\n\n32\n00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:04.275\nkeep in mind is that the web is\nsort of just an extension, right,\n\n33\n00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.855\nof everything that we do\ninside of our network.\n\n34\n00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:09.075\nIt is the outside of the inside.\n\n35\n00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.785\nIt is gonna be what is\nbeyond the boundary.\n\n36\n00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.232\nBeyond the border, if you will,\nof our our networks.\n\n37\n00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:17.802\nNow, having said that, how do we as\ninvestigators understand how to gather\n\n38\n00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.482\ninformation in a place\nthat we may not control?\n\n39\n00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:24.872\nWe may not have visibility over, we may\nnot even be able to interact with, and or\n\n40\n00:01:24.872 --> 00:01:28.442\ninteroperate with, in a way that\nis authoritative, meaningful, and\n\n41\n00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.482\ngives us insight in to what's there.\n\n42\n00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:32.792\nThis is a bit of a challenge,\nif you think about it.\n\n43\n00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:36.160\nEssentially, it's like playing\nblind pin the tail on the donkey.\n\n44\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.195\nHave you ever done that?\n\n45\n00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I can't say that I have.\n\n46\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.930\n&gt;&gt; No?\nRemember the whole\n\n47\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.700\ntiddlywink conversation\nwe had about quarters?\n\n48\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have.\nOkay, I have.\n\n49\n00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.180\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like that only you\ndo it after you've been drinking and\n\n50\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.100\nyou play quarters.\n\n51\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.510\nIt's the next thing that happens.\n\n52\n00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.690\nThey spin you around, and\n\n53\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.980\nyou walk around trying to find\nout where the hidden file is.\n\n54\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.855\n&gt;&gt; And then you go to the.\n\n55\n00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:51.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n56\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.900\nthen potentially you wind up in the.\n\n57\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.780\nSomebody gets a pin the tail on the donkey\nthing in their head, and that's never fun.\n\n58\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.780\nSo don't do that.\n\n59\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.320\nBut when you think about the web,\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n60\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.900\nAs a digital forensics investigator,\nthis is probably one of the biggest and\n\n61\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.820\nmost challenging areas for us, right now.\n\n62\n00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.550\nThe growth of virtualization.\n\n63\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.000\nThe growth of the web.\n\n64\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.520\nHow does all of this infrastructure\nthat often is managed by third parties\n\n65\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.630\nbeyond our control directly,\nalthough on our behalf, certainly.\n\n66\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.570\nHow do we interact with that?\n\n67\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.240\nHow do we investigate what's there?\n\n68\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.110\nHow do we understand how to forensically\ngather evidence in a place where\n\n69\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.440\nwe may not be able to exercise control?\n\n70\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.760\nThis may be a challenge.\n\n71\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.420\nWe're not going to obviously give you\nall the answers to those challenges and\n\n72\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.300\nthose questions during a very small\nepisode about the web and web forensics.\n\n73\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.410\nJust posing a question for you,\nafter CHFI, to start pondering.\n\n74\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.779\nIn the real world,\nthis is a complicated subject.\n\n75\n00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.780\nWe have to deal with negotiator rights to\naudit with a third party cloud provider.\n\n76\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.210\nWe usually have to follow whatever steps,\n\n77\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.390\nwhatever legal requirements they may\nhave in place so that we have to follow\n\n78\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.200\nin order to ensure that we are using\ntheir skills, their capabilities,\n\n79\n00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.420\ntheir services to gather data, but\nto do so in a forensically sound way and\n\n80\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.760\nfollow whatever the jurisdictional\nrequirements are in the geography,\n\n81\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.070\nin the area that we may have to operate or\nthat they are operating within.\n\n82\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.550\nSo we're gonna have to partner, right?\n\n83\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd this is one of the things\nto consider as a CHFI.\n\n84\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.640\nWith regards overall to\ninfrastructure we own ourselves.\n\n85\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.390\nA lot of web infrastructure is\nstill maintained by companies and\n\n86\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.160\nis managed in server rooms and is gonna\nbe maintained either on premise or\n\n87\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.510\nwithin datacenters that are off prem but\nthat we control directly.\n\n88\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.201\nWhatever those things may be,\nhosting areas etc.\n\n89\n00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.171\nIf we can control that, if we organize\nourself around them, we have access to\n\n90\n00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:37.566\nthem, then this is like any other network\ndiscussion, any other email discussion,\n\n91\n00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:41.009\nany other hard drive discussion\nwe've had in any of the episodes.\n\n92\n00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.369\nWe put the Word, web, email, log file,\nnetwork, in front of the forensics\n\n93\n00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.640\nconversation, and we go off and\nwe do what we need to do.\n\n94\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.350\nAnd so this is really\na question of us understanding,\n\n95\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.850\nwhat is the scope of operations?\n\n96\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.290\nWhat's the focal point for\n\n97\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.630\nus being able to gather, forensically\ninvestigate data, and how we do that?\n\n98\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.910\nAnd if the answer is, hey we own that\ninfrastructure, then it's no different,\n\n99\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.650\nthe methodology is the same.\n\n100\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.500\nThe approach or\nthought process is the same.\n\n101\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.170\nIf the answer to the question is,\nwho is in charge and\n\n102\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.930\nwhat can we rely on them to do?\n\n103\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.830\nThat answer is, well,\nwe have to go through this or that party.\n\n104\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.910\nWe have to got to Microsoft, we have to\ngo to Amazon, we have to go to Google, or\n\n105\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.350\nwhoever the managed service provider may\nbe that's offering us Cloud services,\n\n106\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.510\nthen we're gonna have to take\na slightly different approach.\n\n107\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.500\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n108\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500\nBut, having said that,\nwe talked in the logs, and\n\n109\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.995\nnetwork forensics investigation episodes\nabout where logs will be found.\n\n110\n00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:37.365\nDid extensive coverage, not just of\nlogs overall, but web-related logs.\n\n111\n00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:41.025\nWe looked at an IS server installation,\ntalked about apache logs and\n\n112\n00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.745\nremind you where those are found now.\n\n113\n00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:47.412\nWe talked about DHCP and DNS, demonstrated\nto you, where all those logs are,\n\n114\n00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:51.362\nwhat the file format looks like, what kind\nof logging attributes we find and we see.\n\n115\n00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:54.182\nYou went through all of that with us,\nand we have a sense of all of that.\n\n116\n00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:56.992\nSo, let us go back and\nquickly remind ourselves of that.\n\n117\n00:04:56.992 --> 00:05:00.632\nI want to talk about the default\npass available to you for the actual\n\n118\n00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:04.102\napache log files, and then I'm gonna\nactually take us in here in a second,\n\n119\n00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:05.602\nand we're gonna take\na look at a live demo.\n\n120\n00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:11.160\nWe're gonna use a vulnerability assessment\npenetration testing tool to do a live scan\n\n121\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.200\non a Linux web sever, and\nlook at the vulnerability results that\n\n122\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.640\na CHFI may actually use to drive the road\nmapping, the initial investigative\n\n123\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.920\ndiagnosis work around what kind\nof infrastructure we're managing.\n\n124\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.850\nAnd also what kind of vulnerabilities\nwere there, and as a result,\n\n125\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.270\nwhere we may need to focus our attention\nwith regards to information gathering.\n\n126\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.400\nSo let's take a look, if we could.\n\n127\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.860\nLet's go in real quick, here.\n\n128\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.980\nSo our traditional environment,\nwe're gonna go in,\n\n129\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.620\nfirst just remind ourselves of\nwhere log files will be found.\n\n130\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.140\nI do have, and\nI just want to show you so that can see.\n\n131\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.760\nI do have an IIS installation\nrunning on the box, here.\n\n132\n00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.275\nWe have that set up for you.\n\n133\n00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:46.990\nAnd we can see that we can drill in.\n\n134\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.210\nThis is on Server 2008 R2, this is IS 7.0.\n\n135\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.230\nWe could drill in,\nlook at the default website,\n\n136\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.244\nlook at the detailed directory\nlistings of all the subdirectories.\n\n137\n00:05:57.244 --> 00:06:01.000\nAnd keep in mind that all of the\ninformation about the website or websites,\n\n138\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.430\nwhatever the website may be that's on\nthis box, is gonna be hosted here.\n\n139\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.770\nWe can look at the actual files cuz we\ncontrol the box, we control the interface.\n\n140\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.410\nAnd if we wanted to do that,\nit wouldn't be very hard for us, right?\n\n141\n00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.470\nTo go in, to open up for instance,\n\n142\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.980\nInternet Explorer, get rid of\nthe ask me later, and just go in and\n\n143\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.810\ndo something as simple as this.\n\n144\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.280\nAnd when we do this, and all I did, so\n\n145\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.090\nyou can see, was just simply\ntype in http://localhost, right?\n\n146\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.790\nTo get the default website, the default\nwelcome page on the local machine.\n\n147\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.790\nTo show that we do have\na functional website.\n\n148\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.330\nWe can see the IIS7 welcome page there and\n\n149\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.160\nwe're greeting you in a variety of\nlanguages on our programme today.\n\n150\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.570\nCan you pronounce what\nthis one is down here?\n\n151\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.090\nAt the Hos Geldiniz, I think I'm probably\n\n152\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.475\nactually totally ruining that and\nprobably can no longer pronounce that.\n\n153\n00:06:57.475 --> 00:07:02.263\nBut welcome, bienvenido,\nall the different welcome signs are there.\n\n154\n00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:03.179\nBienvenu, right, etc.\n\n155\n00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:04.565\nThat's the extent about of what I can do,\nby the way.\n\n156\n00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:05.412\nShalom, in Hebrew.\n\n157\n00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:06.108\nI can do that one.\n\n158\n00:07:06.108 --> 00:07:06.704\nWelcome.\n\n159\n00:07:06.704 --> 00:07:09.760\nBut the idea is that, you can see we've\ngot our default welcome page, right.\n\n160\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.710\nAnd so we can forensically\nexamine this web server\n\n161\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.470\nknowing there's information there,\nand we certainly could do that.\n\n162\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.100\nBut we would test to make\nsure that it's available and\n\n163\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.210\nwhen we wanna go see the log files that\nmay be there, we can go drill in and\n\n164\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.040\nwe could see the path for log files\non the machine, on the web server.\n\n165\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.200\nLocal drive, whatever it is,\non the web log or log files W3SVC1 and\n\n166\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.880\nthen we have iterated logs there.\n\n167\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.780\nWe could see what the logs are,\nwhat they look like and I can go in and\n\n168\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.310\nlet's just say I open this log file up.\n\n169\n00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.210\nNow let's just take\na look there real quick.\n\n170\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.080\nAnd we can see some information in theory\nabout what the log may or may not contain.\n\n171\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.699\nAnd just information that's in there\nwe can obviously read through and\n\n172\n00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:52.017\nwe'd be able to grab a copy of that.\n\n173\n00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:53.850\nIt wouldn't be much more\ndifficult than that.\n\n174\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.486\nIn Windows, right,\nin an IIS server if we control it.\n\n175\n00:07:56.486 --> 00:07:57.528\nWhat about in Linux?\n\n176\n00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:01.411\nEssentially the same thing with an Apache\nserver, the idea would be that the path or\n\n177\n00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:03.970\npaths we would follow\nare a little bit different.\n\n178\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.807\nInstead of going into the C, or\nin the pub logs, log files directories,\n\n179\n00:08:08.807 --> 00:08:13.190\nwe would go into the user,\nusr local apache logs directory path.\n\n180\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.360\nAnd then below logs we would\nsee two log files of interest.\n\n181\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.583\nOne would be error.log, obviously self\nexplanatory for what's gonna be in there,\n\n182\n00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:22.531\nand access.log.\n\n183\n00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:26.700\nOur access log and\nour error log would be found in that path.\n\n184\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.520\nJust wanna make sure we\nhave a sense of that.\n\n185\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.460\nWith DNS, we go into the DNS directory.\n\n186\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.270\nWith DHCP, the DHCP directory,\nand look for log files there.\n\n187\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.280\nWe've given you in the show notes,\nencourage you to take a look,\n\n188\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.564\na URL that takes you out and gives\nyou some information at Apache.org on\n\n189\n00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:42.670\nthe general structure of logging for\nLinux.\n\n190\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.210\nGives you a little more background there.\n\n191\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.824\nSame thing with Microsoft for IIS, gave\nyou a nice URL to the MSDN developer site.\n\n192\n00:08:49.824 --> 00:08:53.775\nGives you an overview of what\nthe logging process is for IIS,\n\n193\n00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:57.745\nthe attributes in the logs, all that kinda\nstuff that we've already taken a look at.\n\n194\n00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:00.275\nSince we're here,\njust one quick thing about logs.\n\n195\n00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:03.645\nLet me just come down here and\ngo into the logging area.\n\n196\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.040\nAnd I will just quickly\nshow you what I'm gonna do.\n\n197\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.169\nI'm just gonna remind\nyou of what the fields,\n\n198\n00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:11.922\nthe attributes are that we\npotentially can pull in and log.\n\n199\n00:09:11.922 --> 00:09:16.260\nI've gone in the Logging item inside the\nControl Panel, I've double clicked on it.\n\n200\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.072\nI've just brought up\nthe properties page essentially.\n\n201\n00:09:18.072 --> 00:09:21.125\nI'm gonna go to select fields and\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n202\n00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:25.382\nThe one thing that we do wanna be aware\nof is that we do have different kinds of\n\n203\n00:09:25.382 --> 00:09:29.465\nlogging capabilities,\ndifferent log formats, in other words.\n\n204\n00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:32.850\nIIS, NCSA, W3C, or Custom.\n\n205\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.750\nEach one of them may have specific fields\nor attributes associated with them.\n\n206\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.200\nAnd we wanna understand that that may then\naffect the kind of data that we get back\n\n207\n00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.870\nfrom a forensic standpoint.\n\n208\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.725\nSo we would go in.\n\n209\n00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:47.720\nAnd we took a look at this in\nour prior logging episode,\n\n210\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.710\nbut we can see a whole\nlist of fields there.\n\n211\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.460\nWe would check off and\nselect the ones we wanna see.\n\n212\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.080\nNow keep in mind, if we have not\nselected this ahead of time,\n\n213\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.055\nwe're not logging for\nall that information.\n\n214\n00:09:57.055 --> 00:10:00.835\nWe may not be able to reconstitute that\nin the log files after the fact, so\n\n215\n00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:02.365\nwe have to be proactive here.\n\n216\n00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:04.005\nThink about what is available.\n\n217\n00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:06.355\nUnderstand the kind of data\nwe can expect to see and\n\n218\n00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.605\nthen operate accordingly, right?\n\n219\n00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.255\nSo just some information to review there.\n\n220\n00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:11.275\nLet's go in.\n\n221\n00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:14.265\nLet's take a look at how we actually\ndo this vulnerability assessment,\n\n222\n00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:15.965\nthis pen testing scan I talked about.\n\n223\n00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.455\nWe're gonna use the N-Stalker X tool.\n\n224\n00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:20.090\nGonna fire this up here.\n\n225\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.950\nKind of ominous and dark,\nN-Stalker X, right?\n\n226\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.600\nKind of a cool sounding name for a tool.\n\n227\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.855\nWe're gonna just take the URL of\nour machine that we're gonna scan.\n\n228\n00:10:28.855 --> 00:10:31.670\nI've already got that there,\nwe're just gonna take that.\n\n229\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.870\nAnd because I am just so adept, so\n\n230\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.730\nadroit at typing,\nwe're gonna make no mistakes here.\n\n231\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.420\nIf you leave it up to me we'll\nbe off scanning who knows what.\n\n232\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.124\nWe're gonna type that in and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n233\n00:10:43.124 --> 00:10:45.358\nwe're gonna do a OWASP policy.\n\n234\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:49.242\nWe're gonna use the template that we have\nput together in this tool, that gives us\n\n235\n00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:53.147\nall the OWASP vulnerability assessments,\nthe top ten web app vulnerabilities.\n\n236\n00:10:53.147 --> 00:10:55.580\nWe're gonna scan for those,\nlook to see whether or\n\n237\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.636\nnot there's evidence in the tool,\nor through the tool rather,\n\n238\n00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:02.330\non the target machine of any\nvulnerabilities we may wanna be aware of.\n\n239\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.781\nDaniel's done a great job of helping us\nput this machine up and get it up and\n\n240\n00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:07.016\nrunning, as did Ronnie.\n\n241\n00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:07.993\nThey both worked hard on it.\n\n242\n00:11:07.993 --> 00:11:10.832\nAnd I'm sure they've got a few surprises\nin store for us, I would think?\n\n243\n00:11:10.832 --> 00:11:13.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In regards to what's on that machine,\n\n244\n00:11:13.517 --> 00:11:17.613\nwe're gonna find out here in about\nthree minutes, if I remember correctly.\n\n245\n00:11:17.613 --> 00:11:18.600\nSo we're gonna let this run.\n\n246\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.280\nWe just go ahead, we get this started,\n\n247\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.000\njust a couple of quick wizard screens\nhere, really nothing of importance.\n\n248\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.310\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nask the system to get started for us.\n\n249\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.900\nWe're gonna tee that up,\nwe're gonna start our scan.\n\n250\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.839\nTakes a moment or so\nto fire up and to just get going.\n\n251\n00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:34.740\nIt's gotta reach out,\nconnect to the machine.\n\n252\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.205\nAnd we're running this as a VM, so\nit's gonna go out across the Internet or\n\n253\n00:11:38.205 --> 00:11:39.532\nrather across the network.\n\n254\n00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.927\nWe're gonna pretend it is the Internet but\nit's the same thing.\n\n255\n00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:45.950\nAnd it's gonna scan for us, and\nit's gonna start profiling the machine.\n\n256\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.648\nNow, the value of a tool like this, by the\nway, in the real world as we go through\n\n257\n00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:54.526\nthis methodology is that we can\noften use the tools of the hacker.\n\n258\n00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:58.223\nAnd we can use those tools, as we made\nreference to in several episodes,\n\n259\n00:11:58.223 --> 00:12:00.870\nto further the interest\nof the investigator.\n\n260\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.729\nBut we have to use them for\ngood as opposed to evil, right?\n\n261\n00:12:02.729 --> 00:12:05.320\nAnd so we've made this point before.\n\n262\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.290\nYou have a tool like this,\nas we begin to see some data coming in.\n\n263\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.830\nStart to see that we are finding\nvulnerabilities that\n\n264\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.970\nwe're gonna have to then\nobviously drill into.\n\n265\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.904\nThe area on the dashboard right over here,\nas it grows in real time,\n\n266\n00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:18.900\nis showing us vulnerabilities that\nare being scanned and assessed.\n\n267\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.020\nAnd we'll drill in and we'll take\na look at that as soon as it's done.\n\n268\n00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.171\nIt's almost like a graph,\na pie graph going up and\n\n269\n00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:26.330\ndown in real time as I'm talking here.\n\n270\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.800\nSo we're finding quite a bit of\nvulnerabilities here but the idea is that\n\n271\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.170\na lot of these tools that can be used for\nhacking purposes, information assessment,\n\n272\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.920\nsystem assessment tools, with regards to\nvulnerability assessments, pen testing.\n\n273\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.980\nThese tools should be in\nthe toolkit of the CHFI,\n\n274\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.200\nbecause we can run these against a copy,\na hard drive,\n\n275\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.340\nforensically sound of the machine, with\nall the configuration attributes noted.\n\n276\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.340\nWe can reproduce what the state of the\nmachine was at the time of the attack, and\n\n277\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.150\nwe can test and assess for it.\n\n278\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.050\nUnderstand what vulnerabilities existed,\nand most likely do the due diligence and\n\n279\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.580\nalso the scoping and tailoring,\nthe narrowing, the filtering, of focus,\n\n280\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.490\nof mind, of thought process\naround how the attacker got in.\n\n281\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.500\nThis is really reconstructive\ninvestigation, or\n\n282\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.380\nreconstructive information gathering.\n\n283\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.137\nWe're trying to put back the pieces in\nsuch a way that we can have authoritative\n\n284\n00:13:17.137 --> 00:13:21.752\nunderstanding of what the most likely\npoint of entry, or most likely attack\n\n285\n00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:26.100\nsurface or attack vector, was that\nwas used to compromise the system.\n\n286\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.419\nIf we can figure that out,\nwe can reproduce that, document that,\n\n287\n00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:33.102\nauthoritatively explain and\nunderstand that through interpretation,\n\n288\n00:13:33.102 --> 00:13:35.280\nthrough analysis, as we talk about.\n\n289\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.507\nWe then are gonna be in a good position to\nunderstand not only what went wrong, but\n\n290\n00:13:38.507 --> 00:13:41.181\nalso understand what may have been\nleft behind and what was taken.\n\n291\n00:13:41.181 --> 00:13:45.082\nAnd we can explain and obviously\ndocument along the way as to that, and\n\n292\n00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:46.550\nspeak authoritatively.\n\n293\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.155\nSo, wanna keep that in mind.\n\n294\n00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:50.026\nWanna make sure we're aware of that, and\n\n295\n00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.544\nunderstand the importance\nof a tool like this, right?\n\n296\n00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:56.927\nBecause these kind of tools in the hands\nof the right individual can be a very\n\n297\n00:13:56.927 --> 00:14:00.338\nproactive and\nvery helpful security mechanism, right,\n\n298\n00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:03.204\nthat helps us to better\nunderstand our network.\n\n299\n00:14:03.204 --> 00:14:05.792\nBut in the hands of a bad actor,\nthis is a tool that could\n\n300\n00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:08.889\nbe used to expose weaknesses and\nto relentlessly go after them and\n\n301\n00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:11.791\ncompromise the system as a result\nof knowledge found there.\n\n302\n00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:15.270\nAnd we wanna be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n303\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.450\nLooks like we are almost done with our\nscan, just about ready to take a look and\n\n304\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.100\nsee what's done.\n\n305\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.690\nI think it just did actually pop up and\nit's going to tell us in just\n\n306\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.840\na minute that it's finished,\nwe can save off the results.\n\n307\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.150\nAnd what we'll be able to find,\njust while we're waiting on this,\n\n308\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.480\nwe'll just zoom in here real quick so\nyou can see this as it's running.\n\n309\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.410\nWe have a dashboard here, we're gonna\nsee that we have found some cookies.\n\n310\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.560\nWe've got at least one\nweb form on the site.\n\n311\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.330\nWe've got a bunch of vulnerabilities\nthat are listed under there.\n\n312\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.660\nYou can see the URLs\nthat are being crawled.\n\n313\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.091\nYou can see kind of a graphical\nrepresentation of how many vulnerabilities\n\n314\n00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:48.697\nwere found.\n\n315\n00:14:48.697 --> 00:14:54.000\nAlmost 110 high level vulnerabilities,\nroughly about 60 some odd midlevel.\n\n316\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.270\nSo we got almost 180 vulnerabilities\nacross the system, here.\n\n317\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.630\nGood job, sir, that was not bad for\nan evening's work, right?\n\n318\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.050\nAnd so we can go in, we can take a look\nat some of the weaknesses that are here.\n\n319\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.660\nAnd what we can actually do is go in,\njust while it's finishing,\n\n320\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.219\nrandomly open up any one of these and\nas you scroll through here.\n\n321\n00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:13.420\nThere we go, just finished up.\n\n322\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.500\nLet's just go ahead and save that,\nand let's just go ahead and\n\n323\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.520\nkeep the session open.\n\n324\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.050\nAnd we'll click Next,\njust save that off real quick.\n\n325\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:23.860\nThere we go.\n\n326\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.800\nAnd as we scroll through,\n\n327\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.420\nwhat we can see is just line after\nline of all these vulnerabilities.\n\n328\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.550\nThat was all PHP up top, got some\nOpenSSL going on there, looks like,\n\n329\n00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.230\ngot DTL PHP debug\ninformation being exposed,\n\n330\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.680\nwe may be vulnerable\nto a clickjack attack.\n\n331\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.510\nThere's all these different\nvulnerabilities that were assessed there.\n\n332\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.894\nAnd old OpenSSL vulnerability,\nall sorts of stuff going on there, right.\n\n333\n00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:52.990\nLooks like Google hacking\ndatabase signatures were found.\n\n334\n00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.672\nMaybe some Google dorks or Google hacking.\n\n335\n00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:58.036\nThat could be going on in there.\n\n336\n00:15:58.036 --> 00:16:00.520\nLooks like OpenSSL cryptographic issue.\n\n337\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.890\nMay not be using the right level\nof cryptographic protection\n\n338\n00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.390\nto either provide cryptographic\nprotection on the site or\n\n339\n00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.430\nperhaps because of a weakness\nin the implementation.\n\n340\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.870\nWe may be exposing information to certain\nattacks, got to think about that.\n\n341\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.610\nInsecure trace methods that are supported,\nmeaning somebody may be able to go in and\n\n342\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.360\nlook at error codes or debugs, and be able\nto find information out about the site.\n\n343\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.080\nThere's just all sorts of\nstuff going on here, and\n\n344\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.870\nso if we just randomly choose one,\ndoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n345\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.170\nA remote attack against the HTTP,\n\n346\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.370\nagainst the Apache web server,\nis supported it looks like.\n\n347\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.790\nWe could just go in and take a look,\nwe could see that the web attack\n\n348\n00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.600\ninfrastructure, just right here,\nis vulnerable, looks like\n\n349\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.300\nthere is some sort of a vulnerable\nApache interface that was installed.\n\n350\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.600\nAnd because it's of a certain type,\na certain age if you will, it may or\n\n351\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.230\nmay not be patched properly.\n\n352\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.050\nLooks like it may support\nsome remote interface\n\n353\n00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.040\nconnectivity that maybe problematic,\nthat we would wanna avoid.\n\n354\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.350\nThe nice thing about a tool like this if\nyou look at the left there are button\n\n355\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.320\nvulnerability information as you just\nkinda see the box, third item down.\n\n356\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.760\nOr second and down the box over under\nvulnerability, it say's hey details and\n\n357\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.588\nfix, and it tells us potential or\n\n358\n00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:15.310\nit gives us guidance,\nas to what we may need to fix this.\n\n359\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:18.240\nNow that's good because from\nthe general security stand point, but\n\n360\n00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.210\nthat's also gonna help the investigator\nto understand what went wrong,\n\n361\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.660\nwhat we may need to fix it.\n\n362\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.500\nWhether the patch or\n\n363\n00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.360\nthe fix has been applied, and then what\nwe would see as evidence of the fact\n\n364\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.800\nthat something was used to essentially\ntake advantage of a compromise here.\n\n365\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.830\nAnd it would help us to\nbetter reconstruct and\n\n366\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:38.120\nunderstand the circumstances around this\nkind of an attack were to be launched,\n\n367\n00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.340\nor were it to take advantage of us,\nor be used to take advantage of us.\n\n368\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.880\nSo this is something that we do\nwant to understand and know.\n\n369\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.370\nTools like this, just as I'm closing\nout the report on the interface,\n\n370\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.250\nalso tend to have a report management\nfunction associated with them.\n\n371\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.850\nYou could see it right there, and\n\n372\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.700\nagain we're always focused on hey,\nhow do I report on this?\n\n373\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.780\nWhat do I do?\n\n374\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.930\nWhat are the things that\nI have to be aware of?\n\n375\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.620\nAnd when we take a look at a sample\nreport, we can drill in and see that we've\n\n376\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.130\ngot some nice detailed graphics, nice\nlittle overhead summary of what went on.\n\n377\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.933\nImagine being the customer and getting\npresented with this kind of information,\n\n378\n00:18:12.933 --> 00:18:15.040\na nice little graph, some breakdown there.\n\n379\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.370\nWe've got obviously got some\ndetailed information underneath it.\n\n380\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.400\nIt would be very helpful for\nus to be able to look at that.\n\n381\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.430\nIt would also be great to present this if\nwe had to do a report that may wind up\n\n382\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.095\nat some point taking us into court.\n\n383\n00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:27.860\nThis would be a great way to\nsummarize information for people, and\n\n384\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.420\nmost likely would present it to them,\nright?\n\n385\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.550\nSo, the reporting function would\nobviously be very important for\n\n386\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.660\nus to be aware of, and\nto keep in mind and consider as well.\n\n387\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.260\n&gt;&gt; I think if this was your server\nthe judge would probably just say well,\n\n388\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.103\nyou had it coming.\n\n389\n00:18:39.103 --> 00:18:40.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, they may but\n\n390\n00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:43.242\njust to point out how we\nwould present information.\n\n391\n00:18:43.242 --> 00:18:46.540\nNow as well up here, you'll notice\nwe have some other tools, right.\n\n392\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.220\nWe just did the Web Discovery tool, but\n\n393\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.080\nnotice we have a Google hacking\ndatabase reference there.\n\n394\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.020\nWe've got a load tester, don't really\nneed to worry about that for the moment.\n\n395\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.230\nBut brute forcing is\navailable in the tool.\n\n396\n00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.510\nWe've got a lot of other\ntools that may be useful for\n\n397\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.830\nus to test aspects of the security,\nor push on elements that a bad actor\n\n398\n00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.230\nwould potentially use, and obviously\nthat we would want to be aware as well.\n\n399\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.313\nSo that's gonna help us to just\neven get further down underneath\n\n400\n00:19:09.313 --> 00:19:13.150\nin the covers there, and help us to\nbetter understand what we're doing.\n\n401\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.420\nThe other thing I like about\nthis tool by the way and\n\n402\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.970\ntools like this,\nwe have built in a macro recorder.\n\n403\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.660\nWhat that's gonna let us do,\nthis is almost like the step stool,\n\n404\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.170\nyou ever use that in Windows where you\ncan create the new version of Windows.\n\n405\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.920\nYou can create, click through pictures,\ncapture, screen capture what you're doing.\n\n406\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.020\nYou know a lot of times when we're\nengaging in these assessments,\n\n407\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.760\nit's great to be able to\ndocument the steps we took and\n\n408\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.240\nexactly what was going on so\nwe can show that.\n\n409\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.630\nWe can use a tool like that,\n\n410\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.965\nthe built-in macro recorder it's\ncalled PSR, Problem Step Recorder.\n\n411\n00:19:41.965 --> 00:19:43.290\n&gt;&gt; Um-huh.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what it's called.\n\n412\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.070\nWe can use a tool like that\nto be able to actually\n\n413\n00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.400\ncapture detailed screen\nshots at certain key points.\n\n414\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.010\nAnd it would tell us\nexactly what's happening or\n\n415\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.900\nshow us what was going on as we were\nbuilding the forensics investigative\n\n416\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.480\nmethodology behind the scenes here.\n\n417\n00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.707\nSo, tools like this could be\nvery valuable, very beneficial,\n\n418\n00:19:59.707 --> 00:20:02.037\nvery helpful for\nus with regards to going in and\n\n419\n00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:04.758\nbetter understanding what\nmay be going on on the web.\n\n420\n00:20:04.758 --> 00:20:08.066\nOne of the other things that we have\nto kind of bring to the table, really\n\n421\n00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:11.817\nunderstand if you will with regards to\ndoing web forensics, is an understanding\n\n422\n00:20:11.817 --> 00:20:15.230\nof the kind of vulnerabilities and\nthe concerns that we may face.\n\n423\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.060\nEvery web browser, so\nfront end right applications\n\n424\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.930\nare gonna have some vulnerabilities\npotentially associated with them.\n\n425\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.570\nJust read the monthly updates and\npatch assessments, the security updates\n\n426\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.570\nmany vendors, Microsoft or whoever may be,\nyou'll see that there's usually at least\n\n427\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.395\none or two that deal with web\nrelated things in their stack.\n\n428\n00:20:33.395 --> 00:20:35.940\nSo this is a pretty\ncommon issue in concern,\n\n429\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.310\nwe often forget about the fact\nthat many applications\n\n430\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.400\nwill touch the web even though we\ndon't think of them directly doing so.\n\n431\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.950\nSo a lot of times email\napplications will interact with and\n\n432\n00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.490\nuse traffic or\npush traffic across the web.\n\n433\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.850\nIs there a vulnerability in\nthe APIs that are being used?\n\n434\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.060\nWe may or may not know.\n\n435\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.640\nAs an investigator, what we have to do is\nbe open to the idea that no matter what we\n\n436\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.930\nsee, we have to understand that there\ncould be other things that are going on.\n\n437\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.120\nAnd we have to interpret what we see but\nwe have to also\n\n438\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.670\nuse the lens of experience, and\nlens of probability, right?\n\n439\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.110\nTo be able to help us to\nunderstand what we see,\n\n440\n00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.970\nand then make educated assumptions.\n\n441\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.800\nAnd I'm using that word purposely.\n\n442\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.510\nEducated assumptions, right?\n\n443\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.000\nAbout what we see, and\ntry to then figure out what that tells us.\n\n444\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.510\nA lot of times there may have been\na vulnerability exploited in a front-end\n\n445\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:25.360\napplication that led to an insecure\nconnection to a back-end system.\n\n446\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.850\nWe can manipulate and interact with data\ngoing through a front-end forum, and\n\n447\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.130\neven though the system on the back end\nmay be secure, if the front end is not,\n\n448\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.290\nwe may still essentially be able to\nget into the back end as an attacker,\n\n449\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.000\nand we have to think about that.\n\n450\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.180\nSo we have to think about the front end,\nwe have to think about the middle tier,\n\n451\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.850\nthe connectivity, the network interaction,\nthe services layers we go through\n\n452\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.100\ninteract, and\nwe think about the backend tier.\n\n453\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.290\nThe data, where the data stored,\nand how we gain access to that.\n\n454\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.940\nAll three of those levels have to\nbe assessed, investigated, and\n\n455\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.890\nunderstood by us as a CHFI,\nwhen we're looking for\n\n456\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.540\nevidence of malfeasance,\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n\n457\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.510\nAnd from the prospective\nof an investigator,\n\n458\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.480\nwe have to be thinking about,\nespecially with regards to the Web,\n\n459\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.460\nhow broad the world wide Web or\nthe internet may be, and\n\n460\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.585\nour ability to reach out, and as I pointed\nout in the beginning of our discussion,\n\n461\n00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:15.600\nof various places where we\nmay not have rights to go.\n\n462\n00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.695\nWhat's the impact of us being able\nto not see across that border?\n\n463\n00:22:18.695 --> 00:22:21.930\nAnd are we missing information that\nwe normally would need to capture?\n\n464\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.012\nAnd as a result of that,\nare we doing as thorough a job?\n\n465\n00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:28.370\nAre we being as complete as we could\nbe with regards to investigation.\n\n466\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.000\nThese are some of the challenges\nthat we have to think about,\n\n467\n00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.730\nand be concerned with, with regards\nto hacking on the web, and of course\n\n468\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.990\nbeing able to detail out what's going on\nthe web when we investigate that hacking.\n\n469\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.320\n&gt;&gt; Adam, there was a lot of\ncool stuff in this episode.\n\n470\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.660\nMan I love episodes like this.\n\n471\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.240\nWe got to see an interesting\ntool that allows us to scan for\n\n472\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.590\nvulnerabilities on our site,\n\n473\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.690\nthat way we might look through the mind\nof the attacker, as it were, right.\n\n474\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.000\nFollow in his footsteps,\nretrace, and that way look for\n\n475\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.040\nthe evidence that they\nmay have left behind.\n\n476\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.775\nAlso, don't forget our logs are very\nimportant, they typically are just this\n\n477\n00:22:59.775 --> 00:23:02.910\nlovely little recording session\nthat's happening all the time.\n\n478\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.738\nIf something happens,\nit makes a log of it.\n\n479\n00:23:04.738 --> 00:23:08.082\nAll you have to do is go in there,\nlook for those logs, look for any kind\n\n480\n00:23:08.082 --> 00:23:11.887\nof information that might be pertinent\nto your investigation, pull that out,\n\n481\n00:23:11.887 --> 00:23:15.161\nmake your reports, as our lovely\ntools will a lot of times do for us.\n\n482\n00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:18.761\nWe thank them for that, and\nretrace the steps yet again so\n\n483\n00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:24.000\nthat we can have all the information\nnecessary to present our case as it were.\n\n484\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.090\nAdam, I really enjoyed episodes like this,\nso\n\n485\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.970\nI appreciate you dropping by and\nshowing us neat and interesting tools.\n\n486\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.934\nBut it looks like our time has expired for\nthis episode.\n\n487\n00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:36.420\nI know we'll be back for more,\n\n488\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.690\ndon't worry everyone we have plenty\nof CHFI coming up for you guys.\n\n489\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.120\nBut for this one, we're gonna go and\nsign off for ITProTV, I've been you host,\n\n490\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.220\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n491\n00:23:44.220

00:00:12.181\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.055\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.120\nand welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.720\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.480\nwe continue on with more\non our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.030\nAnd back for a part two on web forensics,\nobviously, it's our good friend, Mr. Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.130\nGordon Adam, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.650\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.890\n&gt;&gt; What would happen if it wasn't me?\n\n12\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.570\nWhat if it was part two,\nbut it was somebody else?\n\n13\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.750\n&gt;&gt; I would say their name.\n\n14\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:36.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But then it wouldn't be a part two.\n\n16\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.380\nIt would be-\n&gt;&gt; I think it'd still be a part two.\n\n17\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.790\n&gt;&gt; But not with me,\nit would be a part two with somebody else.\n\n18\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.210\n&gt;&gt; The best part two, right?\n\n19\n00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.152\nThat's how you gotta sell it.\n\n20\n00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:46.336\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not gonna buy that though,\nI don't believe that.\n\n21\n00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:47.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n22\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790\nanyway, I am here to do part two,\nand that is what is important.\n\n23\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.370\nSo, we're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n24\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.350\nWe were talking about web\nforensics in our prior episode.\n\n25\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.140\nIf you have not seen it, by the way,\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n26\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.005\nIt's even better the second time [LAUGH],\nno pun intended there.\n\n27\n00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:00.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n28\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.330\nand so, when you take a look,\nwhat you will find, in part one,\n\n29\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260\nwhich is actually what I just wanna make\nthe linkage to here, as we begin part two.\n\n30\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.780\nIs we did a demo using a vulnerability\nassessment pen testing tool, N-Stalker X.\n\n31\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.410\nWe went out and\nwe scanned a vulnerable web server.\n\n32\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.310\nWe took a look at some of\nthe vulnerabilities that would've been\n\n33\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.230\nlisted there.\n\n34\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.200\nAnd what those vulnerabilities were really\naligned with, based on the scanning\n\n35\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.350\ntemplate we used, was the OWASP Top\n10 Web Application Vulnerability set.\n\n36\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.070\nAnd we wanted to, although we've talked\nabout this in at least one prior or\n\n37\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.000\ntwo prior episodes, wanted to go\nback to it, just reference it for\n\n38\n00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.330\nyou, maybe have a little bit of\nconversation just real quick\n\n39\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.680\nabout some of the key highlights,\ntakeaways on this list.\n\n40\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.330\nWhy are they important?\n\n41\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.296\nWhy, as a forensic investigator, do we\nwanna make sure we are aware of this?\n\n42\n00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:48.144\nWell, most of the things we have\nto deal with with regard to web\n\n43\n00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:51.696\nrelated infrastructure\nare going to happen against on,\n\n44\n00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:55.476\nor through a web server,\nusing the front-end of some kind.\n\n45\n00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:58.870\nAnd if we're gonna be able to interact\nwith information in the web, on the web,\n\n46\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.660\nthrough the web, around the web.\n\n47\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.190\nSay that three times\nfast while you're typing.\n\n48\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.920\nAnd if we need to understand what went on,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.700\npotentially what went wrong there, we need\nto understand the kind of vulnerabilities\n\n50\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070\nwe may be having to look at.\n\n51\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.980\nThe kind of information we may wanna see\nif there were telltale signs to tell us,\n\n52\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.150\nor indicate that these\nthings have occurred.\n\n53\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.620\nAnd understanding what these\nvulnerabilities are may help\n\n54\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.540\nus to do that.\n\n55\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.630\nWe have this nice, little, handy dandy,\n\n56\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.240\nreferenceable list that\nwe can take a look at.\n\n57\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.300\nIf we could just go to our machine,\nreal quick, thank you so much.\n\n58\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.160\nWe can see the top ten list.\n\n59\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.880\nNow, I've shown you where\nto get this before.\n\n60\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.850\nThis is actually out on\nthe OWASP Top Ten website.\n\n61\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.430\nAnd we can see here OWASP.org,\nCategory OWASP Top Ten Project,\n\n62\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.250\nand I know Daniel's captured that for\nus in the show notes.\n\n63\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.180\nWe're not gonna worry about you\nfiercely scribbling down that\n\n64\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.515\nURL trying to capture that.\n\n65\n00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:53.246\nJust a quick disclaimer and word about the\nfact that this going to be potentially,\n\n66\n00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:56.687\ndepending when you go to look at it,\nthe 2013 version.\n\n67\n00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:59.305\nDon't want you to get put off or\nthrown by this.\n\n68\n00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:02.157\nDepending on when you're watching this,\nthis may very well,\n\n69\n00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:05.177\nwhen you go to the site live and\nlook at it yourself, be updated.\n\n70\n00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:08.147\nYou'll see a 2016 version of this.\n\n71\n00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:11.837\nWe are shooting this right\nat the tail end of 2016, and\n\n72\n00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:17.277\nthe compilation of the new 2016 updated\nlist has taken place earlier this year,\n\n73\n00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:19.830\nand will be available in Q1 of 2017.\n\n74\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.540\nOWASP runs these lists\non a three year cycle.\n\n75\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220\nSo, the 2013 list has actually\nbeen in market since roughly Q1\n\n76\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.440\nof probably, I would say 2014,\napproximately.\n\n77\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.470\nAnd so, we've been using that list for the\nlast several years, referring to it and\n\n78\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.460\nusing it.\n\n79\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.250\nInteracting with it,\n\n80\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.880\nhelping us to understand better\nthe vulnerabilities we may see on the web.\n\n81\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.369\nWhen that new list emerges in key one\nof 2017, you'll see that that update\n\n82\n00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.920\nthere takes place, and\nit will just say top ten 2016 PDF.\n\n83\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.618\nWe're gonna show you the 2013 addition,\n\n84\n00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:55.522\nthat's the one I just had\nup that we wanna look at,\n\n85\n00:03:55.522 --> 00:04:00.595\nlet me just scroll back over there, and\nthat's why it says top 10 list for 2013.\n\n86\n00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:04.022\nSo, just be aware of\nthe fact that on this list,\n\n87\n00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:09.080\nwe're going to see a variety of\ndifferent listings, A1 injection,\n\n88\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.985\nA2 broken authentication and\nsession management.\n\n89\n00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:17.170\nCross-site scripting and\ninsecure direct object references.\n\n90\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.610\nWe're gonna see denial of service attacks\n\n91\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.590\nlisted in a couple of\ndifferent categories.\n\n92\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.170\nWe'll see cross-site request forgeries,\nCSRF's,\n\n93\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.040\nwe're gonna see a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n94\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.600\nAnd each one of them,\nits explained it lengthier.\n\n95\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.450\nYou could see a listing right\nhere that kinda shows us\n\n96\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.335\nwhat the overall list will\nlook like top to bottom.\n\n97\n00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.990\nAnd encourage you to go out and\njust make sure you're familiar with them.\n\n98\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.140\nWouldn't necessarily worry about\nknowing them in order when studying for\n\n99\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.170\nthe FCHI exam.\n\n100\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.380\nBut I would worry about making sure\nthat I'm familiar with the top 10 list.\n\n101\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.650\nA sentence or two definition with\neach of these represents, and\n\n102\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.780\nor may be used as, or be used to achieve.\n\n103\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.060\nWould never be a bad idea,\nalways good for us to do that.\n\n104\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.240\nSo, I'm gonna ask you, [INAUDIBLE] you're\nso kind to help me out here and there.\n\n105\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.930\nEven when you're not willing to, I still\n[INAUDIBLE] you, and you do it anyway, so\n\n106\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.830\nyou're a good sport.\n\n107\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.370\nSo, let's just help the nice folks\nhere that are listening to us,\n\n108\n00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.620\nmaybe understand what kind of knowledge\nthey should have about one of these.\n\n109\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.940\nGive them a sense, right?\n\n110\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.770\nSo, let's take something like\nsecurity misconfiguration.\n\n111\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.140\nA5, I think it is, right?\n\n112\n00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.941\nSo, if we talk about something\nlike security misconfiguration,\n\n113\n00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:24.091\nwhat are some things that you think of\nthat may pop into your mind, Daniel,\n\n114\n00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.202\nwhen we think about this?\n\n115\n00:05:25.202 --> 00:05:26.757\nWhat's some ideas?\n\n116\n00:05:26.757 --> 00:05:30.077\n&gt;&gt; I think of maybe firewalls\nthat are misconfigured, right?\n\n117\n00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:34.493\nYou're allowing people to come in through\nports or address ranges that shouldn't be\n\n118\n00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:37.621\nallowed, this is a security\nmisconfiguration obviously,\n\n119\n00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.460\ncuz you don't want people\nto traverse your firewall.\n\n120\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.810\nThat's the whole purpose\nof it being there.\n\n121\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.862\nSecurity misconfigurations, anything\nthat people can interact with that would\n\n122\n00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:51.983\npotentially give them information or\nallow them access to a system that\n\n123\n00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:56.515\nallows everyone, there is no kind of\naccess control list put on either through\n\n124\n00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:00.245\npermissions, or network blocking,\nand something like that.\n\n125\n00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:04.162\nThat would definitely fall into\nthat security misconfiguration.\n\n126\n00:06:04.162 --> 00:06:05.172\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n127\n00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:07.058\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just saying that, you know,\n\n128\n00:06:07.058 --> 00:06:07.841\nthat's all good.\n\n129\n00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:09.085\nThere may be some other substance,\n\n130\n00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:11.736\nsomething, for instance,\nmaybe something I'm gonna do with patches.\n\n131\n00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:12.417\n&gt;&gt; Patches, yes.\n\n132\n00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:15.365\n&gt;&gt; Would fall in that list,\nand that's a good one as well.\n\n133\n00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:16.960\nI mean, there's so\nmany things we can think of.\n\n134\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.690\nI mean, Daniel said a couple of\nreally important ones for us.\n\n135\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.790\nThere's a whole bunch.\n\n136\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.870\nMy point is, it's probably not gonna\nbe important for you to able to list 20\n\n137\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.660\nthings that would be on a list like this,\nbut rather to sum up what Daniel said,\n\n138\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.910\nwhat I just threw in there\nas a little bit of extra.\n\n139\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.870\nThe idea behind something security\nmisconfiguration would be awareness of\n\n140\n00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.930\nthe fact that there's probably a need\nto have a baseline control, right?\n\n141\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.820\nUnderstanding that the system should\nbe configured a certain way, and\n\n142\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.360\nto assess whether or\nnot that system meets those requirements.\n\n143\n00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.960\nAnd if it doesn't, making sure where\nthe gaps are where the holes are.\n\n144\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.450\nDid we open up ports,\nas Daniel said, in the firewall?\n\n145\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.270\nEither on purpose or\n\n146\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.810\nby accident, that are not supposed to\nbe open allowing a covert channel.\n\n147\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.380\nSome sort of pathway to get into\nthe system we may not monitor.\n\n148\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.460\nDid we not apply the most recent patch?\n\n149\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.510\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n150\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.290\nmaybe open up a vulnerability\nthat the vendor was aware of.\n\n151\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.770\nBut we didn't take steps to prevent.\n\n152\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.600\nThese are the kind of things\nwe want to think about.\n\n153\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.680\nSo, going down that list, we want to have\na sense of what all of those things are.\n\n154\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.890\nCan we put that list back up, because we\nwant to quick walk through that list?\n\n155\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.800\nAnd just reference it.\n\n156\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.680\nNow, in the show notes,\nI've given you not just that list, but\n\n157\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.130\nI think, I've given you,\nif I'm not mistaken, 22 items over a haul.\n\n158\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.147\nRight, that, potentially, are derivatives\nof this, or related in some way.\n\n159\n00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:27.501\nI encourage you to take\na look at just what's there,\n\n160\n00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.563\nhave a sense of the kinds\nof things that show up.\n\n161\n00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:35.719\nThings, like, buffer overflows, things\nlike zero data attacks, log tampering,\n\n162\n00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:41.109\nsession fixation, what we commonly call,\nspoofing, cookie, or session poisoning.\n\n163\n00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:42.942\nAnd these are all listed\nin the show notes.\n\n164\n00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:46.917\nThey're not necessarily all on this\ntop ten list, but they're derived from\n\n165\n00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:50.109\nelements of this list, and or\nare represented as sub points.\n\n166\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.352\nSo, I just wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with it, but\n\n167\n00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:55.437\nI wanna hit the highlights on this list,\nand this gives you a general sense over\n\n168\n00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:58.426\nthe next few minutes of the most\nimportant elements associated with this.\n\n169\n00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:00.716\nSo, injection attacks.\n\n170\n00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:04.382\nThis is a category Is probably\nthe most important element or\n\n171\n00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:08.970\nmost important category we have with\nregards to web vulnerabilities.\n\n172\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.390\nWe're talking about using some\nform of code manipulation.\n\n173\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.800\nWe're injecting usually SQL, structured\nquery language code of some kind.\n\n174\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.250\nBut it could be an LDAP injection,\nan SQL injection.\n\n175\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.700\nThere could be a lot of\ndifferent injection types.\n\n176\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.700\nWe often talk about structured query\nlanguage, SQL, being the most prevalent.\n\n177\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.460\nBut it's not the only type of\ninjection attack, just so you know.\n\n178\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.190\nBut the idea, generically,\nis we're gonna take some sort of code,\n\n179\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.230\nwhatever that code may be,\nwe're gonna then try to push that code in,\n\n180\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.130\nor use that code to pass data,\npass a request for data or\n\n181\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.850\ninformation back to a system log,\nthe back-end behind the web server.\n\n182\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.790\nThe web server is often the gateway.\n\n183\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.590\nIt's the door we wanna go through.\n\n184\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.060\nBut I may not be the target\nof the attack directly.\n\n185\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.300\nAnd injection attacks are usually\ntargeting the databases that sit\n\n186\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.990\nbehind the web servers,\nlooking to gain information from them and\n\n187\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.390\nmanipulate them although they certainly\ncan be used to target directory services.\n\n188\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.430\nSo LDAP injections are used to target\ndirectory or service controllers, so\n\n189\n00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.550\ndomain controllers.\n\n190\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.400\nBut they do have databases of\na kind associated with them.\n\n191\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.450\nWe may be looking to target\nthe web server, using an injection\n\n192\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.360\nthat is hacked to compromise it, to load\ncode into it, and so link this attack,\n\n193\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.220\nthis methodology, to another attack\ntype where we're gonna manipulate code.\n\n194\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.570\nMaybe an XML code injection, or\nan XML code manipulation attack, where we\n\n195\n00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.070\nmodify the code running in the system\nto then exploit against other machines.\n\n196\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.990\nSo there's a lot of different\nways to interpret this.\n\n197\n00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.319\nBut ultimately, injection attacks\nare about seeking advantage by using\n\n198\n00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:47.854\neither buffer overflows or some sort of\nlack of control on behalf of the people\n\n199\n00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:51.203\nthat setup access to the system\nto do input validation and\n\n200\n00:09:51.203 --> 00:09:55.739\nboundary checking to ensure that the data\nwe're putting through a web form or\n\n201\n00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:59.633\nsome sort of front end data connection\nis gonna be of a valid type.\n\n202\n00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:03.399\nAnd it's of a valid form and\nin a valid or structured in a valid way.\n\n203\n00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.287\nIf we don't do those kinds of things,\n\n204\n00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:09.670\nwe're gonna fall prey to this kind over\nthis classification, this type of attack.\n\n205\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.370\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n206\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.700\nBroken authentication and\nsession management.\n\n207\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.560\nWe're thinking about access\ncontrol issues here, right?\n\n208\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.120\nWe're thinking about the use or\n\n209\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.070\nthe lack of use of single session keys and\nreplay prevention.\n\n210\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.210\nSo we're gonna make sure that we're using\ntechnology typically in web servers today\n\n211\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.585\nthat prevent attacks from taking place\nby reuse of session credentials,\n\n212\n00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:35.050\nmasquerading and spoofing this category\nwe'll have to talk about here.\n\n213\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.820\nIf we're doing these kinda things and\n\n214\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.480\nwe're forcing everybody that connects\nto the web server to authenticate every\n\n215\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.660\ntime they connect regardless of where they\ncome from, regardless of who they are,\n\n216\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.280\nregardless of whether they were just there\nor not, if we force them to reconnect and\n\n217\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.770\nby reconnecting, reauthenticate,\nwe're gonna cut down dramatically\n\n218\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.030\non the bad actor's ability to spew for\nmasquerade by doing a session hijack and\n\n219\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.430\nthen taking over control and\npretending to be somebody else.\n\n220\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.890\nAnd so broken authentication and\nsession management\n\n221\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.940\nhelps us to understand that these kinds\nof controls need to be in place so\n\n222\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.410\nwhen we don't have them,\nthese kinds of things can happen.\n\n223\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.200\nAn oldie, a goodie, and a really,\n\n224\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.350\nreally cool one, Cross-Site Scripting,\nwhat's called XSS attacks.\n\n225\n00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.860\nNow XSS attacks and\ndown there, I think item A8,\n\n226\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.050\nCross-Site Request Forgery,\nare very closely aligned.\n\n227\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.860\nPeople often will either explain one,\nthinking it's the other, or explain one,\n\n228\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.710\nsaying it's both.\n\n229\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.120\nThere's a slight variation,\nslight difference here.\n\n230\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.770\nBut they are essentially\ntwo sides of the same coin.\n\n231\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.690\nAnd so we wanna understand what\nhappens with an attack like this.\n\n232\n00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.330\nLet me just do the following.\n\n233\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.800\nI'm just gonna scroll out here for\na second.\n\n234\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.890\nI'm going just kinda come over here for\na second.\n\n235\n00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.710\nAnd what I'm gonna do is just\nzoom right back in over here.\n\n236\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.230\nAll I did was just do a Google search on,\n\n237\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.290\nas you can see,\nwell you can't see cuz I'm down there,\n\n238\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.040\nbut I did a Google search on images for\ncross-site scripting examples, right?\n\n239\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.430\nJust bring me up a bunch\nof different ones.\n\n240\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.667\nAnd we got all sorts of pictures here.\n\n241\n00:11:56.667 --> 00:12:00.280\nYou could see there's all sorts of\nexamples of different ones that may exist.\n\n242\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.023\nBut let's just take a look\nat a typically one,\n\n243\n00:12:02.023 --> 00:12:03.508\nfor a second, just to give you a sense.\n\n244\n00:12:03.508 --> 00:12:07.596\nThe idea is that you have a hacker, right,\nand the hacker is gonna infect a website\n\n245\n00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:10.550\nahead of time with some\nsort of exploitation code.\n\n246\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.150\nAnd then what's gonna happen is\nthe victim is gonna visit that site and\n\n247\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.420\nessentially become compromised\nby the code on the web page.\n\n248\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.910\nAnd then the code either\ncontrols the victim's machine or\n\n249\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.920\nsomehow redirects the victim out\nto another site that the hacker\n\n250\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.370\nwants them to visit or\nto interact with, or\n\n251\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.940\nmaybe just in doing whatever the hacker\nwants them to do, exposes information.\n\n252\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.790\nMaybe credentials are exposed.\n\n253\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.070\nMaybe banking information is exposed.\n\n254\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.430\nWho knows what's gonna be exposed?\n\n255\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.820\nWe can see all different\nexamples like a little skull and\n\n256\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.730\ncrossbones there, right, little dark\nworld, dark web kinda thing, right, so\n\n257\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.060\nwe got all sorts of different\nexamples going on here.\n\n258\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.240\nPoint is when we think about this kind\nof an attack, what we're actually\n\n259\n00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.290\nthinking about is the ability of the bad\nactor to be able to manipulate the code\n\n260\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.510\nrunning in the web server to then infect\nthe client when they connect, seeking to\n\n261\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.538\ngain control, and causing them to execute\na script or to redirect somewhere.\n\n262\n00:13:04.538 --> 00:13:06.967\nI almost look like a superhero, right?\n\n263\n00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:08.235\n[SOUND] Right?\n\n264\n00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:09.450\nAnti-Hacking Man.\n\n265\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.635\nThat could be my superhero alias.\n\n266\n00:13:11.635 --> 00:13:15.330\nAnti-Hacking Man, or I could be Blue Guy.\n\n267\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.760\nBut Blue Guy's also kind of [INAUDIBLE] in\norder to get the whole blue group thing.\n\n268\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.460\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to shave.\n\n269\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.693\nThat would not go well for me.\n\n270\n00:13:19.693 --> 00:13:21.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Would not work well.\n\n271\n00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:21.845\n&gt;&gt; Anti-shaving.\n\n272\n00:13:21.845 --> 00:13:22.810\n&gt;&gt; I'm anti-shaving.\n\n273\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.580\nWe'll skip Blue Guy.\n\n274\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.329\nWe'll go with\nAnti-Hacking Guy [INAUDIBLE].\n\n275\n00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:28.958\nAll right, so when we do all this,\nwhat we're thinking about is really just\n\n276\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.450\nunderstanding that cross-site scripting is\nabout the bad actor getting control and\n\n277\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.252\nmanipulating the systems that we can\nthen gain control of the person who's\n\n278\n00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:37.780\ncoming in.\n\n279\n00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.200\nSo I wanna make sure were aware of this.\n\n280\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.876\nThe logged-on victim's browser is gonna\nbe forced to do something based on code\n\n281\n00:13:42.876 --> 00:13:43.980\nmanipulation.\n\n282\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.730\nWhen we think about insecure direct\nobject references, when we built through,\n\n283\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.680\nand we look at what may be in the code\nunder line in a web server, and\n\n284\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.750\nthis is also kinda interesting.\n\n285\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.160\nI don't know if you've actually ever\ndone this or are aware of this.\n\n286\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.860\nSo let me open up Internet Explorer\nhere for just a second.\n\n287\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.730\nJust bring this up and\nlet's just go out to a website.\n\n288\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.369\nGive me a half a second to do this and\njust bring up any website,\n\n289\n00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:17.370\ndoesn't really matter which one,\nwe'll just bring up CNN, right?\n\n290\n00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.180\nNow when I do this, as soon as it loads,\nof course it may take a second or\n\n291\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.385\ntwo to load, but what we wanna do, I would\n\n292\n00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.635\nnot really care about the website itself\nloading, I'm not worried about that.\n\n293\n00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:30.215\nWhat I just wanna show you\nis that when I hit F12 and\n\n294\n00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:34.110\nthere is an equivalent in most browsers,\nChrome has an equivalent hot key.\n\n295\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.273\nSo does Firefox.\n\n296\n00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:36.992\nYou just have to figure\nout what key it is.\n\n297\n00:14:36.992 --> 00:14:39.700\nWhat we're using is looking\nat the developer tool\n\n298\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.740\nkit that's associated\nwith the web browser.\n\n299\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.550\nI can actually look in to\nthe underline code on the web page.\n\n300\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.070\nAnd I can see the HTML code.\n\n301\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.250\nIn Chrome I think it's up under\nAdvance Settings and Properties.\n\n302\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.170\nYou gotta go into the browser and\nthen enable this, but you can see it.\n\n303\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.020\nAnd what we can go ahead and do is\nthat we can look at all the underline\n\n304\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.990\ncode in the header and\nactually across the entire site.\n\n305\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.200\nAnd so as the result of this,\nthis is the older one under IE,\n\n306\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.076\nthe newer one's in IE 11, etc.\n\n307\n00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:05.080\nLook a little bit different,\nbut essentially, same idea.\n\n308\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.269\nI can look it all the underline script and\ncode and if there's insecure references,\n\n309\n00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:13.281\nif somebody's hardcore to the path to a\ndirectory on a web server instead of using\n\n310\n00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.890\na variable, I'll be able to see that.\n\n311\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.189\nEither it's a bad actor, we'd be able\nto go in, potentially follow that path,\n\n312\n00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:21.467\nand see what's there.\n\n313\n00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:25.164\nAnd if that path, for instance,\nlooked something like this,\n\n314\n00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:29.280\nit's good to know that website loads so\nquickly that it's not there,\n\n315\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.280\neven five minutes while I'm talking,\nright?\n\n316\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.680\nSo if it was something like this\nwhere you're just going back to IE,\n\n317\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.700\nthe path essentially pointed back to\nthis directory on my default website.\n\n318\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.070\nIf a hacker knew that, then they could go\ninto the web server directly, using maybe\n\n319\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:48.860\nan exploit like the one you said\nyou've created, the shellcode exploit.\n\n320\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.708\nWe're gonna call it\nDaniel's shell from now on.\n\n321\n00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:55.303\nAnd so if we use that exploit, we may be\nable to gain access to this web server,\n\n322\n00:15:55.303 --> 00:15:59.334\ngo in to that directory, and\npull this data out because we hardcoded\n\n323\n00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:03.322\na reference to it in the code that\nwe saw when we loaded the webpage.\n\n324\n00:16:03.322 --> 00:16:04.365\nThat was not supposed to be there.\n\n325\n00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:05.994\nWe should be using variables for\nthis stuff.\n\n326\n00:16:05.994 --> 00:16:08.324\nWhat about user credentials to\nmake it hardcoded in there?\n\n327\n00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:12.240\nUsernames and passwords to create\ndata connects, ODBC connections.\n\n328\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.510\nAll sorts of stuff gets put into\nthis code underlying the web.\n\n329\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.655\n&gt;&gt; Or like you said,\nno sanitation for the input on\n\n330\n00:16:18.655 --> 00:16:19.655\n&gt;&gt; Or sanitizing and\n\n331\n00:16:19.655 --> 00:16:22.415\nnormalizing data values when we\nput them in, absolutely correct.\n\n332\n00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.655\nSo if any of that kind of\nstuff is not happening and\n\n333\n00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:28.075\nwe're not normalizing our data, imagine\nthe kind of chaos that would ensue.\n\n334\n00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:29.465\nAnd the kind of stuff we're giving away.\n\n335\n00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:31.265\nI mean, just think about all\nthe stuff that's going on in there.\n\n336\n00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:34.305\nI mean, it's just crazy when you\nthink about what may be happening.\n\n337\n00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:35.305\nSo we've got a lot of these.\n\n338\n00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:38.015\nWe've got Security Misconfigurations,\nwe talked about that one.\n\n339\n00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:39.465\nSensitive Data Exposure.\n\n340\n00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:42.360\nI talked about credentials being\nembedded there and things like that.\n\n341\n00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.468\nMissing functional level access control.\n\n342\n00:16:44.468 --> 00:16:47.490\nDaniel spoke to access control earlier,\ntalked about some of the issues and\n\n343\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.380\nconcerns there.\n\n344\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.260\nUsing known vulnerable components.\n\n345\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.780\nUsing the component we know has\na vulnerability in it without\n\n346\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.530\npatching for it.\n\n347\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.215\nRight?\nWe spoke about that a little bit.\n\n348\n00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:58.880\nUnvalidate and redirects and forwards,\nwe're redirecting you from this\n\n349\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.020\nURL on this page somewhere else\nwithout knowing where you're going.\n\n350\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.170\nIf you're not reverse proxying and\nreverse authenticating today then you're\n\n351\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.240\nopening up your users to\na wealth of concerns.\n\n352\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.490\nA lot of times these days websites\nare not just authenticating,\n\n353\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.290\nyour authenticating them,\nthey're authenticating back to you.\n\n354\n00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.310\nAnd that's what we call\na reverse authentication.\n\n355\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.380\nAnd when that happens\nyour being validated or\n\n356\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.570\nthe information your getting back from\nweb server validates so you're connecting\n\n357\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.560\nto a legitimate system If you don't\nknow that and you click on a hyperlink,\n\n358\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.790\nthis is the problem with phishing\nattacks for instance, right?\n\n359\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.080\nYou click on a hyperlink without knowing\nwhere it goes, and you're off in space and\n\n360\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.220\nyou're out at a website that\nessentially a bad actor controls.\n\n361\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.310\nThat's gonna be a problem.\n\n362\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.755\nThat's gonna really be\na significant issue.\n\n363\n00:17:40.755 --> 00:17:41.887\nSo this kind of stuff that\ngoes on all the time.\n\n364\n00:17:41.887 --> 00:17:44.557\nAre you one of those people that's in the\nhabit of looking at the URL's before you\n\n365\n00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:45.507\nclick on them and go to them?\n\n366\n00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:46.202\nYou know what they are?\n\n367\n00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:47.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n368\n00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:47.749\n&gt;&gt; Or on a URL?\nSo\n\n369\n00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:48.691\nwhen you see the ones that are like .ru or\n\n370\n00:17:48.691 --> 00:17:49.982\nsomething you're clicking\non those right away?\n\n371\n00:17:49.982 --> 00:17:51.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That's my favorite ones.\n\n372\n00:17:51.189 --> 00:17:56.765\n&gt;&gt; That's one of\n\n373\n00:17:56.765 --> 00:18:02.351\nmy favorite\n&gt;&gt; Don't have knowledge\n\n374\n00:18:02.351 --> 00:18:05.558\nof who controls it, but the reality is\nsometimes these things are spoofed and\n\n375\n00:18:05.558 --> 00:18:07.050\nwe may not realize they're there.\n\n376\n00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.340\nIt may actually be cool just to\ndo a quick demo to that effect.\n\n377\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.370\nSo let me just show you\nwhat I'm talking about and\n\n378\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:18.030\nthis is just something that is actually\nreally, really easy and simple to do.\n\n379\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.290\nJust give me half a second,\nlet me just come over here.\n\n380\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.630\nLet me come over here.\n\n381\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.240\nAnd can ask you anything.\n\n382\n00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.760\nJust type in.\n\n383\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.300\nI think let's type in direct.\n\n384\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.650\nWait I don't know about that.\n\n385\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.500\nHold on a sec.\n\n386\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.240\nWhat I did was the following,\nwanted to load, Microsoft.\n\n387\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.580\nYou know what?\n\n388\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.390\nActually I forgot I don't\nhave it on this machine.\n\n389\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.490\nI have it on this machine.\n\n390\n00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.855\nThat's right,\nbecause I'm in the wrong place.\n\n391\n00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:46.810\n[LAUGH] Let me just load up Word here.\n\n392\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.760\nJust give me half a second to\nbring that up under Office.\n\n393\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.090\nAnd there it is right there, okay.\n\n394\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.990\nSo just gonna show you something\nthat you may not realize, but\n\n395\n00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.960\nactually would be interesting just\nto be aware of Just open up there.\n\n396\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.528\nAnd so let's say, hypothetically for\na minute that we go into Word and\n\n397\n00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:03.931\nwe type in something like.\n\n398\n00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:08.924\nHello?\n\n399\n00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.424\nIt's blocked.\n\n400\n00:19:16.424 --> 00:19:17.624\nOkay, you know what?\n\n401\n00:19:19.808 --> 00:19:21.070\nWe did not activate it.\n\n402\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.080\nI forgot.\nI kept forgetting we didn't activate that.\n\n403\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.700\nI can do that in Notepad no problem,\njust give me a second.\n\n404\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.130\nI keep forgetting I'm not paying\nattention to the warning on the screen.\n\n405\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.460\nLet's say we do something like this,\n\n406\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.340\nhey you're not supposed to type\nbecause it's not activated.\n\n407\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.400\nSo let's say that we typed in Theory or\nWord,\n\n408\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.670\nany document it wouldn't matter where,\nwe typed in a statement.\n\n409\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.872\nSomething like click here for.\n\n410\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.342\nClick here for your software,\nwhatever that message would be,\n\n411\n00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:47.450\nright, something innocuous.\n\n412\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.560\nBut what we would do underneath\nit is create a URL that actually\n\n413\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.830\ncreates a hypertext, right,\na link for that code.\n\n414\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.070\nAnd what it would really\nactually equate to typically\n\n415\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.648\nIt was something like this, right?\n\n416\n00:19:57.648 --> 00:20:00.016\nwww.malware.com.\n\n417\n00:20:00.016 --> 00:20:02.560\nHopefully it doesn't equate to that.\n\n418\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You get the idea, right?\n\n419\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.480\nBut the idea behind it is that a lot\nof times when we go and we look at\n\n420\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.520\nthe hyperlink on the text we just point to\nit and go well, we're gonna click on it.\n\n421\n00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.720\nWe don't really know where it goes, and\n\n422\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.320\nwe don't necessarily know that\nthere may be a URL underneath it.\n\n423\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.960\nWe just think Well, I'm gonna click on\nthat because somebody said go there.\n\n424\n00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.760\nIf we're previewing it and\nif you hover and you could see, and\n\n425\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.570\nyou often can if you just pay attention.\n\n426\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.520\nYou can click and preview without\nclicking rather I should I say you\n\n427\n00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.490\ncan hover in preview, can actually\nsee that the URL is often displayed.\n\n428\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.280\nAnd so we can see it's really malware.com,\nwell I don't wanna go there right.\n\n429\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.420\nAnd so when we're doing investigation\nof this kind of stuff we look at\n\n430\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.710\nemails for instance.\n\n431\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.780\nWe look at documents that may have URLs,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n432\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.930\nWe want to be able to go in.\n\n433\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.060\nAnd we want to understand where\nthe links were pointing to.\n\n434\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.920\nWe have to actually vet and\nexamine and look at every one of these\n\n435\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.070\nto make sure we understand that\nclick here for your software\n\n436\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.340\nreally from our perspective is this, and\nas an investigator we wanna see that.\n\n437\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.690\nWe wanna see that URL.\n\n438\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.240\nWe wanna know what's happening there and\nwe wanna say well,\n\n439\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.750\nthat's probably when we go and\nwe resolve and we figure it out.\n\n440\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.930\nThat may be the bad URL.\n\n441\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.620\nThat may be the place where somebody\nwent and all of a sudden wow,\n\n442\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.940\nthere's a problem, right?\n\n443\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.830\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that and so\n\n444\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.470\ndon't be thinking that not looking at\nthose URLs Is going to be important,\n\n445\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.860\nit's very important, and we have to make\nsure we go in and take a look at them.\n\n446\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.950\nThe last one that I think we skipped over,\nI just want to come back to and\n\n447\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.930\nmake sure we talk about,\nis the cross-site request forgery, right?\n\n448\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.750\nSo this is similar in some respects\nto a XSS cross-site scripting.\n\n449\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.190\nI want to make sure we\nhave a sense of this.\n\n450\n00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.740\nWhen we do cross site request forgery\n\n451\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.090\nwhat we're doing is we're\ntaking a logged on victim.\n\n452\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.410\nAgain, you have the idea of the person\nthat's gonna be targeted is the user\n\n453\n00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.400\nthat's connecting to the site, typically\nwith their browser or something like that.\n\n454\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.620\nSo wanna make sure we have that.\n\n455\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.190\nWe're sending information In and\n\n456\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.470\nout of the web server on\na regular basis remember, right?\n\n457\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.550\nSo when I connect,\nI say hey good morning Mr.\n\n458\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.920\nWeb Server I'm here, show me some content.\n\n459\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.820\nWeb server brings it back, puts it in my\nmachine and I start interacting with it.\n\n460\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.625\nThat's standard, that's traditional.\n\n461\n00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:05.375\nBut we often have to send some sort\nof information to the web server.\n\n462\n00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:06.915\nMaybe we stored a cookie and\n\n463\n00:22:06.915 --> 00:22:10.725\nmaybe that cookie is gonna represent or\nreproduce who we are.\n\n464\n00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:15.100\nAnd as a result of that,\nthat information Is vulnerable to attack.\n\n465\n00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.900\nA bad actor can grab that cookie.\n\n466\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.810\nA bad actor can impersonate either\nthe web server or who we are, and\n\n467\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:25.010\nthen can cause that information to be\nused against us if we're not careful.\n\n468\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.860\nSo a logged on victim's browser sends\ninformation, and as a result of that,\n\n469\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.270\nthe victim's session cookie and\nauthentication information are often sent.\n\n470\n00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.460\nWell if the bad actor knows that,\nwhen we're logging in, can't they execute,\n\n471\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.820\nessentially, a session hijack?\n\n472\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.390\nGet in the way?\n\n473\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.760\nTake over our session?\n\n474\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.720\nAnd as a result, maybe then\nauthenticate or, quote, unquote,\n\n475\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.960\nauthenticate and\npretend to be us and take over.\n\n476\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.890\nAnd then as a result\ninteract with the system and\n\n477\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.460\nthe system thinks it's really us\nwhen in fact it's the bad actor.\n\n478\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.770\nAnd this is a little sleight of hand.\n\n479\n00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.780\nIt's like a shell game, right?\n\n480\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.610\nWhere we're swapping one session for\nanother.\n\n481\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.930\nAnd as a result of that if the website\nthinks that it's a legitimate user but\n\n482\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.070\nin fact it's the bad actor,\nwe may wind up having a problem.\n\n483\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:12.290\nAnd so request forgery is about\nessentially identity theft, impersonation.\n\n484\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.350\nRight?\nWe're impersonating somebody\n\n485\n00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.380\nafter the initial swap or\ninformation exchange and\n\n486\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.450\nthen attempting to leverage that\nto our advantage as a bad actor.\n\n487\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.560\nKinda sneaky and\ndevious when you think about it, right?\n\n488\n00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Insidious even.\n\n489\n00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.180\n&gt;&gt; It could even be said to be insidious.\n\n490\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.785\nI may have to do the evil laugh and\nkinda do the whole hand thing.\n\n491\n00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:30.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, do that again.\n\n492\n00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:34.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, it looks like I was doing that but\n\n493\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.370\nI was not.\n\n494\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.680\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about these.\n\n495\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.170\nNow in addition to all these, there's\nalso the other things, as I mentioned.\n\n496\n00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.250\nWe talked about things like log tampering,\nwhy logs are so important, we've\n\n497\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.060\ntalked about zero-day exploits, in the\nsense that there's always code out there.\n\n498\n00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.520\nThough we may not be aware of.\n\n499\n00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.460\nThat even vendors may not be aware of.\n\n500\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.350\nIt could be against us out of the blue.\n\n501\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.043\nSomebody comes up with one of\nthese exploits nobody's seen or\n\n502\n00:23:58.043 --> 00:23:58.986\nheard about before.\n\n503\n00:23:58.986 --> 00:24:02.431\nLaunches and all of a sudden\nbad things start happening.\n\n504\n00:24:02.431 --> 00:24:06.680\nWe may be doing brute force attacks or\nmaybe trying to brute force SSH May be\n\n505\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.830\nable to take advantage of some\nsort of form on the web and\n\n506\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.707\nyou'll get it to render an error,\nand if it does,\n\n507\n00:24:12.707 --> 00:24:17.390\npotentially get information back from\nit that may actually be helpful to us.\n\n508\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.610\nYou ever get one of those random weird\nerrors where you login to a website and\n\n509\n00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.400\ninstead of giving the either\n404 error page not found,\n\n510\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.930\nor you get the 402 or 406 error,\nwhatever there's a problem.\n\n511\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.030\nWhat you get instead is get the yellow\npage with the red angry text\n\n512\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.840\nscreaming at you.\n\n513\n00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The old unhandled exception, right.\n\n514\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.940\nBut then it exposes,\n\n515\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:40.390\nif you take a look at what's in there, lot\nof times it will expose the database type.\n\n516\n00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.040\nExpose the web server type,\nexposes the path, exposes the credential.\n\n517\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.110\nThere's all this stuff that's\nsupposed to be kept internal,\n\n518\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.120\nbehind the scenes between\nthe web server and the database.\n\n519\n00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.050\nAnd you're not showed to you but the\nproblem is because the person who wrote\n\n520\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.520\nthe code, the developer didn't effectively\nthink through the logic of this error and\n\n521\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.795\nwe have what's called\nan unhandled exception.\n\n522\n00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:05.150\nEssentially an error that occurs but there\nis no instructions in the software that\n\n523\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.170\ntells us hey when this happens do this.\n\n524\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.224\nAnd as a result we actually just throw\nthe error code up on the screen.\n\n525\n00:25:10.224 --> 00:25:14.620\nWell, the problem becomes that we expose a\nvery large amount of data when we do that.\n\n526\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.720\nI love when I see that on sites,\nbecause I know the site is vulnerable.\n\n527\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.910\nI don't love it, it's a bad thing,\n\n528\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.980\nmy point is, as a security professional,\nI'm concerned.\n\n529\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.680\nBut when I look at it,\n\n530\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.000\nI obviously understand that\nsomebody's not doing their job.\n\n531\n00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.810\nBut it tells me that there\nare vulnerabilities and\n\n532\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.020\nconcerns there,\nwe'll wanna be aware of that.\n\n533\n00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.140\nThese kinds of things, as an investigator,\nare gonna become very important to us.\n\n534\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.600\nIf we probe the site and we find that\nwe have all these little weaknesses.\n\n535\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.650\nRemember, using tools like the End Stalker\ntool and other tools that we've shown you.\n\n536\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.280\nAnd knowledge of lists like the OWASP Top\nTen can be incredibly important for us.\n\n537\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.550\nTo understand how to, not only take\naway information from an exercise about\n\n538\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.580\ninformation gathering that helps us to\nzero in on concerns, but also if we\n\n539\n00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.480\ndo this proactively, helps us to actually\nput ourselves in a better position and so\n\n540\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.100\nwe have to be thinking about what\nthe job of CHF file ultimately is.\n\n541\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.220\nIs not just to come in after the fact\nreactively and address concerns, but\n\n542\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.420\nif we're smart about how we approach our,\nessentially our job and what we do.\n\n543\n00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.490\nWe may be able to offer value proactively\nto the organization up front,\n\n544\n00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.980\nbecause we may be able to assess need and\nconcern and\n\n545\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.880\nthen come up with an action plan,\na partnership with others to prevent\n\n546\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.760\nthe very things that we're being asked to\naddress from occurring before they do.\n\n547\n00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.780\nAnd, that would be a very good outcome for\neverybody.\n\n548\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.400\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n549\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.700\nI can't think of too many people that\nwould be upset with you if you said hey,\n\n550\n00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.630\nwhile I was doing this forensics\ninvestigation I did find multiple ways\n\n551\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.640\nin which you're vulnerable, but do wanna\nkeep us from having to come back and\n\n552\n00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.990\npay us more money to figure out\nhow you got exposed or exploited.\n\n553\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.600\nYou might wanna close that down.\n\n554\n00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.540\nSo they do find those types\nof things very, very helpful.\n\n555\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.520\nAnd they're happy for you to do that.\n\n556\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.330\nBut Adam also brings to\nthe forefront of our mind that\n\n557\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.545\nthe importance of staying abreast\nof the most common vulnerabilities.\n\n558\n00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:03.110\nOWASP continually creating their top\nten list is a great thing for us.\n\n559\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.200\nYou should be visiting it, have a copy\nof it, print it out on your desk.\n\n560\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.250\nWherever it needs to be,\njust throw it out there.\n\n561\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.817\nAnd then make sure you understand how\neach one of those top ten vulnerabilities\n\n562\n00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:14.880\nare used, at least have working knowledge.\n\n563\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.942\nAnd I'm not saying you to be a hacker and\nknow how to implement them.\n\n564\n00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:23.507\nBut just knowing how they work and\nthe theory behind them,\n\n565\n00:27:23.507 --> 00:27:26.040\neven that will be helpful for you.\n\n566\n00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.502\nAnd Adam, you've done a great job yet\nagain reminding of these things, or\n\n567\n00:27:29.502 --> 00:27:32.281\nat least bringing that to\nthe forefronts of our minds.\n\n568\n00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:35.820\nThat being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of web forensics.\n\n569\n00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.770\nWe're glad you guys joined us today,\nbut it's time for us to signoff.\n\n570\n00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.777\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Laurie.\n\n571\n00:27:40.777 --> 00:27:42.009\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n572\n00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:44.170\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n573\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:50.094\n[MUSIC]\n\n574\n00:27:50.094 --> 00:27:53.693\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.450\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.929\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.030\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.220\ntoday we are continuing on with\nmore in our CHFI series, of course.\n\n8\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.740\nAnd back with us yet\nagain to lend his expertise, his\n\n9\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.050\nenormous wealth of knowledge on that very\ntopic, is our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.260\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, welcome, thank you, welcome.\n\n12\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to you.\n\n13\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, welcome to all of us.\n\n14\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.381\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n15\n00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.844\n&gt;&gt; I could do, remember Brainiac?\n\n16\n00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:39.365\n&gt;&gt; Brainiac?\n\n17\n00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:40.536\n&gt;&gt; Brainiac, yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.618\nI could do that,\nwe're talking superhero stuff, right?\n\n19\n00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:43.937\n&gt;&gt; Yes, see the big thing, the bulging-\n&gt;&gt; The big,\n\n20\n00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:46.444\nenormous knowledge retention stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:47.810\n&gt;&gt; With the giant veins pulsing.\n\n22\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.233\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, exactly,\nso that could be me.\n\n23\n00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.393\nInstead of blue guy I could be Brainiac.\n\n24\n00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:51.650\n&gt;&gt; Brainiac [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.800\n&gt;&gt; Cuz blue guys, then I'd have to shave,\nthat wouldn't be good.\n\n26\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.150\nAll right, so anyway, here we are.\n\n27\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.690\nThat was our random aside,\nwe got that out of the way.\n\n28\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.589\nSo now we don't have to worry about that,\n\n29\n00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.859\nwe can actually talk about important\nstuff so let's talk about email.\n\n30\n00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.300\nYou know we send, we receive so\nmuch information today.\n\n31\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.260\nMore so probably than ever\nbefore at any point in time.\n\n32\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.023\nAnd yet we do so\n\n33\n00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.993\noften without thinking about\nthe implications of what's in that email.\n\n34\n00:01:12.993 --> 00:01:15.916\nWhat we may be able to tell about\nthe person that sent it, and or\n\n35\n00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:16.880\nwhere it came from.\n\n36\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.850\nWe're gonna take you into\nthe wonderful wide world\n\n37\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.870\nof email header examination\nhere in a couple of minutes.\n\n38\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.320\nShow you some of the stuff\nwe want to know.\n\n39\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.080\nBut when we start to talk about email and\nthink about it from a forensics\n\n40\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.930\ninvestigative perspective we got\nto start with some of the basics.\n\n41\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.590\nEmail is, after all,\na client-server based architecture.\n\n42\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.190\nWe have two moving parts.\n\n43\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.790\nWe have the front end, the client,\nthe application that's used for email.\n\n44\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.640\nWe have the back end server piece where\nthe email is going to be processed,\n\n45\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.960\nsent through, and or\nultimately come to rest.\n\n46\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.290\nAnd of course along the way, we have to\nthen think about all the different areas\n\n47\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.660\nof the network or\nnetworks that email may transit across.\n\n48\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.020\nHow many different kinds of email\nservers would you say there are?\n\n49\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.960\n&gt;&gt; As far as the services themselves?\n\n50\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.290\n&gt;&gt; As far as the services themselves.\n\n51\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.230\n&gt;&gt; I know of three.\n\n52\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.960\n&gt;&gt; You know of three.\n\n53\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n54\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Do tell.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go over three, right?\n\n55\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.120\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pray, pray tell.\n\n56\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.130\nWhat would they be?\n\n57\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.100\n&gt;&gt; SMTP, right?\n\n58\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.180\nThe simple-\n&gt;&gt; SMTP, okay.\n\n59\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.990\nYeah, simple mail transfer protocol.\n\n60\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.872\nThere is POP, right?\n\n61\n00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:13.760\nPOP, the post office protocol,\nthere is also IMAP.\n\n62\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.220\nAnd I don't know if Exchange\nqualifies as it's own.\n\n63\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.157\nI know it's a little bit like\nIMAP in a certain way, but-\n\n64\n00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:24.050\n&gt;&gt; It's genericically it's an SMTP capable\n\n65\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.670\nserver that acts using\nthe capabilities for IMAP.\n\n66\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.050\nIt does support IMAP, It doesn't use\nIMAP directly unless you enable it.\n\n67\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.687\nBut it is essentially an X.400\nmessaging standard compliant server.\n\n68\n00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:40.890\nAnd as a result,\nessentially falls into one of those three.\n\n69\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.800\nBut you're right,\nin terms of server types, SMTP,\n\n70\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.140\nsimple mail transfer protocol,\nport 425 by the way.\n\n71\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.930\nPOP, specifically POP3,\nand port 110 on that.\n\n72\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.900\nThat is a store-and-forward solution.\n\n73\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.870\nEssentially, we will gather\nup mail at the server.\n\n74\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.730\nYou connect and we push the mail to you.\n\n75\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.110\nWe don't keep it on the server.\n\n76\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.330\nThat's how POP works.\n\n77\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.307\nAnd IMAP4 is on port 143, that's kind\nof like a file server essentially.\n\n78\n00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:10.160\nLets you keep a copy of the mail up on\nthe server but also lets you download one.\n\n79\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.920\nWe support and use SMTP, Exchange is gonna\nbe considered classified under that.\n\n80\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.380\nWhich behaves like a file server in\nthat respect and behaves like IMAP.\n\n81\n00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.870\nYou can enable POP and IMAP support\nthrough Exchange, but not normally done.\n\n82\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.160\nAnd this is not normally\na Microsoft class.\n\n83\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.540\nWe're not here to talk about all that and\nto get into all that.\n\n84\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.270\nI was just pointing out, and\nDanny was helping me to point out\n\n85\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.370\nthat there are different\nkinds of email services.\n\n86\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.650\nDepending on how we choose to\ninvestigate what services are used.\n\n87\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.710\nWe may need to to know ports and\nwe may need to know functionality and\n\n88\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.540\ncapabilities.\n\n89\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.643\nIt would be helpful, in other words,\n\n90\n00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:42.784\nto know from a forensic standpoint that\nwhen we are looking at a POP server,\n\n91\n00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:47.278\nwe're not gonna find evidence of email\nthat is going to be sitting on the server.\n\n92\n00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:50.510\nIf the client's already connected and\ndownloaded it, the email is gone.\n\n93\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.260\nWe will find evidence or\nrecords of it in the log.\n\n94\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.370\nBut the actual information itself\nhas been moved down to the client,\n\n95\n00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.310\nbecause it's simply a staging area, right?\n\n96\n00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.450\nWe store and forward, we don't retain.\n\n97\n00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.190\nAnd so we have to know that because we\nmay have to go down to the client now\n\n98\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.390\nto investigate to find that actual\nevidence or those email messages.\n\n99\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.220\nSo it's important for\n\n100\n00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.570\nus to think about the different kinds\nof email servers that exist out there.\n\n101\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.600\nWhat about email itself?\n\n102\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.430\nAre there different parts\nof an email message?\n\n103\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n104\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.920\n&gt;&gt; What do you think?\n\n105\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.648\n&gt;&gt; Of course, there's a body,\nthere's a header information,\n\n106\n00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:20.400\nyou alluded to that earlier.\n\n107\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.555\n&gt;&gt; There are, I should say.\n\n108\n00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:24.086\n&gt;&gt; The to and from fields,\nthere's all sorts of cool stuff.\n\n109\n00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:26.962\nYou ever drill down\ninto an SMTP server and\n\n110\n00:04:26.962 --> 00:04:30.350\nactually log in through\nnon-graphical means.\n\n111\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.790\nYou'll see a lot of the low level\nSMTP commands are there and\n\n112\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.710\nyou can play around with them.\n\n113\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.740\nYou'll see the different parts\nof an email because of it.\n\n114\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.299\nIf you wanted to create an email\ndoing it that way, which may or\n\n115\n00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:44.501\nmay not be legitimate [LAUGH].\n\n116\n00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.942\n&gt;&gt; It would be legitimate,\n\n117\n00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:50.910\nit just may not be an appropriate use of\nthe SMTP command line or ESMTP, right?\n\n118\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.090\nSo either extended SMTP or SMTP.\n\n119\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.318\nBut you can write and send and\nreceive emails from a command line with no\n\n120\n00:04:56.318 --> 00:04:58.820\ngraphical client,\nDaniel's point's well taken.\n\n121\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.490\nAll we've done with things like Outlook or\nany of the graphical mail clients, right,\n\n122\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.648\nthat we use is give you a nice interface\nto get you out of the command line.\n\n123\n00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:10.966\nBut you could send and receive email using\nthe generic commands that are used in that\n\n124\n00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:13.002\ntool from the command line at any time,\n\n125\n00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:15.855\nas long as you're logged on\nas an authenticated user.\n\n126\n00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:18.938\nAnd or can provide,\nas you were hinting at, by spoofing and\n\n127\n00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:23.098\nmasquerading a credential to make it\nlook like you're an authorized user.\n\n128\n00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:26.360\nWe're not gonna go into how you do\nthat here, but join us for CEH and\n\n129\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.270\ncome back and take a look.\n\n130\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.810\nWe may explain that to you in more\ndetail when we have those conversations.\n\n131\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.750\nI'm pretty sure we covered that and\ntalked about that in CEH.\n\n132\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.980\nBut the idea is not unheard of and\nby any means unsound.\n\n133\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.710\nAnd this is one of the ways that\nspoofing and masquerading takes place.\n\n134\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.020\nSo we would want to understand\nthat from a command line,\n\n135\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.540\nwe actually can access a SMTP queue.\n\n136\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.601\nAnd we can actually send and receive\ninformation using either, as I said,\n\n137\n00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:50.650\nSMTP or extended ESMTP commands.\n\n138\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.120\nIf you're not familiar with them,\njust go out and\n\n139\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.510\nGoogle SMTP command line or\nESMTP command line.\n\n140\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.902\nYou'll find all the commands and\nthe command structure there, so\n\n141\n00:05:57.902 --> 00:05:59.067\nit is something to think about.\n\n142\n00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.091\nBut we do have a header, we do have\na body, and we do have a signature\n\n143\n00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.700\ntraditionally, the three traditional\nsections or areas of an email.\n\n144\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.220\nAnd as Daniel hinted at and\n\n145\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.860\nsaid, there's a lot of stuff in\nthe header that may be of interest to us.\n\n146\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.630\nLet's go ahead and take a look\nactually at what those look like so\n\n147\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.110\nthat we can see firsthand what they are.\n\n148\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.650\nSo what I'm gonna do is center\nmyself right here on my\n\n149\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.440\nlittle line on the edge of my screen,\nand then I'm going to lean.\n\n150\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.400\nActually I should lean this way, but I'm\ngonna lean over towards my, this would be\n\n151\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.720\ncool if I had another hand controlling\nthe mouse so I can move this way.\n\n152\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.270\nAnd it would actually, no not you,\n\n153\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.030\nI could move this and\nit would actually move the mouse.\n\n154\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.938\nThat would've been cool, cuz then it would\nactually look like I was leaning into\n\n155\n00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:36.193\nthe machine when in fact I'm not.\n\n156\n00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:37.930\n&gt;&gt; You just need a third arm.\n\n157\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.630\nI do, I do, yeah, that would be helpful.\n\n158\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.870\nOr, I could just sit here and\n\n159\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.053\npretend that I don't have hands cuz\nit looks like I don't when I do this.\n\n160\n00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:44.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then the mouse moves and\n\n161\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.670\nyou wouldn't really know either way.\n\n162\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.739\nCuz if the camera shot was\njust a little bit higher,\n\n163\n00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:51.150\nyou would see me from maybe here up and\nthen everything would look magical.\n\n164\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.550\nAnd it would be, cuz it's that\ntime of the year here at ITProTV.\n\n165\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.276\nAll right, so let's just first talk\nabout where email comes from and\n\n166\n00:06:57.276 --> 00:06:57.957\nhow we get to it.\n\n167\n00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.195\nIt's interesting,\nwe have programs like this one,\n\n168\n00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:03.770\neMailTrackerPro, that allows us\nto take an email address and say,\n\n169\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.170\nhey, what path did it use to send and\nreceive across?\n\n170\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.200\nWhat's the network trace?\n\n171\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.960\nEssentially, a traceroute with regards\nto sending and receiving email.\n\n172\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.650\nAnd so when we do something like this,\nwe could see that we're able to go in.\n\n173\n00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.430\nI'm able to use my email address,\nadam@itpro.tv.\n\n174\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.592\nI'm able to trace it, I'm able to go in\nand take a look at, as you could see here,\n\n175\n00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:24.347\nall the hops.\n\n176\n00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:28.225\nThe IP addresses, the hop names of where\nI'm sending and receiving to and from.\n\n177\n00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:31.585\nAnd I'm able to get information\nabout this connection.\n\n178\n00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:35.529\nI'm able to see, for instance, that this\nis running a mail server using ESMTP,\n\n179\n00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:36.871\nwe just talked about that.\n\n180\n00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:40.753\nSome mail service on port 25 means\nthat we can send and receive.\n\n181\n00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:45.910\nAnd it looks like there's no HTTP,\nHTTPS, or FTP services running.\n\n182\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.340\nSo we know a little bit\nabout that email system and\n\n183\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.650\na little bit about the pathways\nthat are being used.\n\n184\n00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.807\nAnd this is one of the tools that\na forensic investigator may use to better\n\n185\n00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:58.572\nunderstand how email moves back and\nforth and where it goes from.\n\n186\n00:07:58.572 --> 00:08:00.526\nAnd where it is sent from and\nwhere it is sent to.\n\n187\n00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:01.703\nWe haven't looked at the header yet.\n\n188\n00:08:01.703 --> 00:08:03.596\nWe're gonna go in and\ntake a look at that right now.\n\n189\n00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:06.830\nBut we wanna understand, first of all,\nwhat the path looks like to send or\n\n190\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.509\nreceive mail,\n\n191\n00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.430\nbecause this begins to tell us part of the\ncompelling story we need to understand.\n\n192\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.370\nWho sent it?\n\n193\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.920\nHow did it get from here to there?\n\n194\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.150\nAnd under what conditions did it get sent?\n\n195\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.010\nAnd as the result, we may look at\nlog files that will then validate\n\n196\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.855\nsome of the information\nwe find along the way.\n\n197\n00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:22.050\nCould we get back in here?\n\n198\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.404\nSo let's take a look at another\npiece of the puzzle here.\n\n199\n00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.088\nLet's go in and\n\n200\n00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:28.196\ntake a look at a website that essentially\nhelps us to do the same thing.\n\n201\n00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:33.140\nThis one is called CentralOps.net,\nthe tool called Email Dossier or dossier,\n\n202\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.986\ndepending on where you come from,\nI suppose.\n\n203\n00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:38.101\nBut they have a whole bunch\nof little utilities over here\n\n204\n00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.004\nto the left you can see.\n\n205\n00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:42.608\nThey have a domain track, or\ndomain checking tool, email one,\n\n206\n00:08:42.608 --> 00:08:43.689\na browser mirror.\n\n207\n00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:46.148\nThey got standard ones,\nNSLookUp, Trace Route, etc.\n\n208\n00:08:46.148 --> 00:08:48.470\nBut you can see I use one\nof my other email address.\n\n209\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.695\nagordan@nhflorida.com.\n\n210\n00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:53.545\nDid a trace on this one, and\nwhat I was able to find.\n\n211\n00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:58.710\nLet me just scroll down so\nyou can see, is I was able to look at\n\n212\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.580\nthe SMTP session here to see how\nmail would be resolved and sent.\n\n213\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.090\nThis email address is\nhosted at Office 365,\n\n214\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.230\nso in the Cloud at microsoft.com, or\noutlook.com, rather, with Microsoft.\n\n215\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.570\nAnd so you could see it goes through,\nit resolves there.\n\n216\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.550\nAgain, and the SMTP system is found there.\n\n217\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.788\nAnd we can then see\ninformation about this.\n\n218\n00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:21.370\nAnd you could actually see some of the\ncommands that Daniel was talking about.\n\n219\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.791\nWe could see pipelining and\nDSM and Start TTLS and binary and\n\n220\n00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:28.807\ncheck running and all that kinda stuff.\n\n221\n00:09:28.807 --> 00:09:32.078\nWe could see all of this here and\nwe can actually see mail from and\n\n222\n00:09:32.078 --> 00:09:34.999\nmail to and we could see\nthe reset command being issued.\n\n223\n00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:38.831\nAnd so we could see that there was a quick\nping to the interface, an establishment of\n\n224\n00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:41.792\nconnectivity,a validation that\nI'm actually a valid user and\n\n225\n00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:43.700\nthen a break in the transmission.\n\n226\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.159\nThis is the beginning of\nthe setup of an email exchange.\n\n227\n00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:50.282\nAnd so we could validate these things\nonline as we're doing our investigations\n\n228\n00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:54.403\nto be able to better understand and ensure\nthat we have knowledge of the fact that\n\n229\n00:09:54.403 --> 00:09:57.991\nthis legitimate user, or\nthis user has a legitimate email account.\n\n230\n00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.117\nAnd as a result we then\ncan probably go in and\n\n231\n00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:02.133\nbegin to find information out about it.\n\n232\n00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:05.786\nNow, what if we have an offline archive,\nlet's say a PST or\n\n233\n00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:09.140\nan OST or\nthe equivalent in another email system?\n\n234\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.987\nAnd we have essentially\na file that we've gathered.\n\n235\n00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:16.191\nRemember, access FTK, for instance, does\nfile grabs on all sorts of offline data.\n\n236\n00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.207\nWe would do a forensically\nsound copy on a hard drive,\n\n237\n00:10:19.207 --> 00:10:23.100\nwe would get a copy of the PST if\nit was stored on the local machine.\n\n238\n00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.462\nWe may then come across that, find\nthat and then be able to load that up.\n\n239\n00:10:26.462 --> 00:10:31.128\nNow Access FTK actually has a tool that\nwill let us go in and look at this itself.\n\n240\n00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:34.315\nBut we could also use the tool like\nthe email examiner from Paraben.\n\n241\n00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:38.422\nI have this tool loaded up here,\none of many that we could look up.\n\n242\n00:10:38.422 --> 00:10:42.258\nAnd you'll see when we load up\na tool like this, we could go in and\n\n243\n00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:44.290\nwe could load the PST.\n\n244\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.610\nI loaded it up here for\nour mythical user, S Smith, right?\n\n245\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.820\nAnd we loaded up a PST file\nthat represents some of\n\n246\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.010\nthe emails that may have\nbeen in their inbox.\n\n247\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.570\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n248\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.660\nI could then begin to literally\nread the emails and look at them.\n\n249\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.650\nSo you talk about, hey,\ncan we get in and see someone's email?\n\n250\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.180\nI can go in, I can grab this file and\n\n251\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.560\nessentially I can get all\nthe email that they've seen.\n\n252\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.400\nIf you use Outlook and you set up an\noffline archive down in your local machine\n\n253\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.420\ntoday, so you can use Microsoft's Outlook\nproduct offline and see all your inbox.\n\n254\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.580\nYou may have a 20, 30, 40 gig,\nwho knows how big, file.\n\n255\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.205\nI could pull that.\n\n256\n00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:20.750\nI could see every email\nthat's been sent and\n\n257\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.660\nreceived by you up until the last time you\nsynchronized by using a tool like this.\n\n258\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.898\nAll I have to do is get the file and\nopen it up.\n\n259\n00:11:26.898 --> 00:11:28.899\nSo I can drill through, as you can see.\n\n260\n00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:33.407\nI can go in, I can see the Inbox, I could\nsee if there's any Gmail related stuff,\n\n261\n00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:35.090\nI can drill through that.\n\n262\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.810\nI v see Spam, Sent mail,\nJunk mail, etc., you name it.\n\n263\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.490\nI could see all sorts of information.\n\n264\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.644\nLittle email poking out the bottom there.\n\n265\n00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:43.061\nCould we go to full screen for a second?\n\n266\n00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:44.870\nLittle email poking out the bottom there.\n\n267\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.394\nYou can kinda see me\npreviewing it down there and\n\n268\n00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:51.580\nyou can see that I've got some\ninformation right there about the header.\n\n269\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.940\nI can actually go in,\nI can see the message ID.\n\n270\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.140\nScroll over there.\n\n271\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.538\nI could see sent and received.\n\n272\n00:11:57.538 --> 00:11:58.859\nSubject to and from.\n\n273\n00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:01.170\nWho it was sent to,\nwhere it was received from.\n\n274\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.610\nI could see all of that.\n\n275\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.930\nI can highlight that.\n\n276\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.470\nI can go in, I can actually\nsee the text of the message.\n\n277\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.050\nSo I can go in, I can actually\nsee this information right here.\n\n278\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.210\nI could see the actual email itself.\n\n279\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.690\nI can go in, I could see\nthe underline message code in HTML.\n\n280\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.240\nSo I could see, scroll back it.\n\n281\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.940\nI could see that right here.\n\n282\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.880\nSo I could see it that way.\n\n283\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.320\nI could see the raw HTML code.\n\n284\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.620\nSo I can actually look at and\nsee HTML information in here.\n\n285\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.260\nI'm just kinda scrolling through.\n\n286\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.460\nI could see all the code in HTML.\n\n287\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.740\nSo I could actually read\nthe information right there.\n\n288\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.070\nI could also come over here and I could\nsee additional information down here.\n\n289\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.272\nI could see creation date,\nmodification date, time and stamps,\n\n290\n00:12:46.272 --> 00:12:49.400\nall that kinda stuff about\nwhen it was sent and received.\n\n291\n00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.720\nI could see whether the message has\nbeen deleted, has it been encrypted?\n\n292\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.910\nHas it been sent with a priority flag?\n\n293\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.110\nI'm reading the header information right\nout of the email by doing this and\n\n294\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.310\nI can just scroll through.\n\n295\n00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.070\nI can see recipients,\nand I can see senders.\n\n296\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.170\nSo I could see this information.\n\n297\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.220\nWho was it sent to and from.\n\n298\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.150\nEmail from Gmail, that kind of thing.\n\n299\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.990\nWas it sent using SMTP, POP3,\nIMAP4, whatever it would've been.\n\n300\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.790\nRemember you asked about that.\n\n301\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.290\nWe could see the protocol there.\n\n302\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.570\nSo we could see all that.\n\n303\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.780\nAnd as I scroll down and\n\n304\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.488\njust continue on, I can actually see all\nthat information including the subject.\n\n305\n00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.820\nAnd I could do that for\nany of the emails that are in the inbox.\n\n306\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.525\nI just picked one but I can go through and\nI could look at any one if these and\n\n307\n00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:36.225\nI could see all sorts of information in\nhere, regardless of what it would be.\n\n308\n00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:39.415\nUsing a tool like this forensically\nallows me to go in and\n\n309\n00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:40.573\nto start pulling up emails.\n\n310\n00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:43.487\nImagine now as an investigator, right,\nwhat I could do with these emails.\n\n311\n00:13:43.487 --> 00:13:47.907\nI could go in, I could take that email, I\ncould export it, I could probably come in,\n\n312\n00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:50.557\nas you'll see I'm about to do here,\nI could generate a report.\n\n313\n00:13:50.557 --> 00:13:52.197\nWe know how important reports are.\n\n314\n00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:53.727\nWe know the value of bookmarking, so\n\n315\n00:13:53.727 --> 00:13:57.537\nwe could see what's in that system and\nunderstand the information.\n\n316\n00:13:57.537 --> 00:13:59.287\nI've opened up a case in this tool.\n\n317\n00:13:59.287 --> 00:14:01.699\nAnd I'm adding data to it, so\nI could generate a report for it.\n\n318\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.280\nSo let's click here just to see\nwhat kind of options we have.\n\n319\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.219\nI could go in and\nI can generate an HTML report,\n\n320\n00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:13.661\nI can get a simple report, a CSV export.\n\n321\n00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.742\nAn HTML evidence summary report, I can\nkinda specify where I wanna put that.\n\n322\n00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:18.250\nAnd then I could obviously open\nthat up and interact with it.\n\n323\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.730\nSo let's say that we go in and\nwe do a HTML investigative report.\n\n324\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.930\nClick Next, specify the information,\nspecify the information that I may want\n\n325\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.030\nfrom the fields here\nwith regards to email.\n\n326\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.450\nLet's just take a look at\na few of the options here.\n\n327\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.640\nSubject, to, from, sent date,\nencrypted, modified, replied.\n\n328\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.370\nWhat are the things I wanna\nknow from the header?\n\n329\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.570\nRemember, all this data's\nin the header already.\n\n330\n00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.620\nThis is not dynamic data that\nwe're capturing in real time.\n\n331\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.940\nWe're looking at an offline\ncopy of a hard drive.\n\n332\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.918\nIt's got a PSD file, this is static\ndata that we're just pulling in.\n\n333\n00:14:51.918 --> 00:14:54.217\nSo the attributes are all\nin the data grab already.\n\n334\n00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:56.420\nAll you have to do is just check\noff the ones I want to add them in.\n\n335\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.350\nWhich is nice, unlike when we said\ndynamic log files are being created\n\n336\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.648\nin real time that we may not\nactually get all that data.\n\n337\n00:15:01.648 --> 00:15:04.951\n&gt;&gt; It has a check all button most [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does have a check all button.\n\n338\n00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:05.772\nWe like that, right?\n\n339\n00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:09.196\nSo we can just simply do check all,\nglad that you pointed that out.\n\n340\n00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:10.680\nThat is very important, right?\n\n341\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.800\nNow in addition, export messages to\nan external folder and add links.\n\n342\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.860\nCan we go back to full screen so\nyou could see that please?\n\n343\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.250\nYou'll see down there, export messages\nto an external folder and add links.\n\n344\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.970\nWe can actually send the messages out to\na separate folder, gather them up and\n\n345\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.470\nprovide them as a separate, essentialy,\nfile that could be examined or used.\n\n346\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.860\nSo tools like this have a lot of\ncapabilities, a lot of attributes and\n\n347\n00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.908\nthings that we would want to do.\n\n348\n00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:37.964\nSo we could specify that,\ndo Next there, include case history,\n\n349\n00:15:37.964 --> 00:15:43.451\nexport case history as that as well, maybe\nadd, remove any additional files, right?\n\n350\n00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:46.181\nHit Finish,\nspecify where that's going, right?\n\n351\n00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:50.810\nThat'll get set up and then I could go out\nand I can review that report if I want to.\n\n352\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.310\nAnd I can go take a look at it.\n\n353\n00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:57.087\nWhen I generate a report,\noops, actually right here.\n\n354\n00:15:57.087 --> 00:16:03.431\nThe report goes to whatever path we\nspecified, and so if we just copy that.\n\n355\n00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:09.807\nAnd then we go in and we take a look.\n\n356\n00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:14.300\nWe see a report is sitting right there.\n\n357\n00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.600\nThere's our folder.\n\n358\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.940\nAnd we see that we have\nan HTML-based report.\n\n359\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.210\nWe got this nice little\nreport that pops up.\n\n360\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.960\nAgain formatted all nice and pretty.\n\n361\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.020\nTells us who the investigator was.\n\n362\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.210\nThere's my case log, exported out.\n\n363\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.890\nI can go read it right there.\n\n364\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.050\nGot our name for\nthe mail storage evidences, right?\n\n365\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.042\nEvidences as opposed to evidence.\n\n366\n00:16:36.042 --> 00:16:37.553\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Evidences, right?\n\n367\n00:16:37.553 --> 00:16:40.505\nSo we can see all that and\nso we can go in.\n\n368\n00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:45.660\nWe can actually, it does tell us, by\nthe way, what the pathway is for all that.\n\n369\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.890\nAnd we can come in and we can take a look\nand we can see everything right there,\n\n370\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.720\njust kinda scroll down.\n\n371\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.080\nWe can see all sorts of information,\nwhat may be included, right?\n\n372\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.780\nWhat's important.\n\n373\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.690\nSo it's kinda nice, right?\n\n374\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.770\nThat we can go in and\ntake a look at that report,\n\n375\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.390\nit's got all the information in there,\nthe case log, etc.\n\n376\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.270\nThat's been generated, so real easy to do.\n\n377\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:10.090\nAnd then in addition, once we've done all\nthis, if we wanna add new evidence in\n\n378\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.400\nwe just keep going in and\nadding in other evidence.\n\n379\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.200\nWe can go grab all sorts of\ndifferent mail directories or\n\n380\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.200\nexternal storage mechanisms for\nmail systems, right?\n\n381\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.790\nAOL, Outlook obviously,\nThunderbird, the bat is there.\n\n382\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.835\nE-mail files generically, all sorts.\n\n383\n00:17:25.835 --> 00:17:27.345\nThis is a slightly older\nversion of the tool.\n\n384\n00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:31.275\nSo you may see some of these and\ngo what the heck's that, what's AOL?\n\n385\n00:17:31.275 --> 00:17:32.735\nNever seen that before, right?\n\n386\n00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.895\nBut the reality is that we certainly\nhave a lot of different e-mail types.\n\n387\n00:17:35.895 --> 00:17:38.215\nAnd so we can go in and\nwe can work with any of these.\n\n388\n00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:41.145\nAnd when we're done, of course,\nand we close this out and\n\n389\n00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:45.445\nwe then are able to present our findings\nwe're able to show somebody ultimately and\n\n390\n00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:49.090\nauthoritatively from a forensic\nstandpoint what was in the e-mail.\n\n391\n00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.090\nAnd we also get the attachments,\nby the way.\n\n392\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.910\nWe can see all that information,\ninteract with it all, and\n\n393\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.380\nunderstand everything that's there.\n\n394\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.340\nThis leads us back to the idea of\nwhat kind of crimes, ultimately,\n\n395\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.640\nwhat kind of activity in a negative\nway can be committed through e-mail.\n\n396\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.540\nThings like spamming certainly\nwe know about today most likely.\n\n397\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.070\nThings like mail bombing.\n\n398\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.480\nCreating mail storms\njust overwhelming people,\n\n399\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.858\nessentially denial of service\nactivities with e-mail.\n\n400\n00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:14.700\nFishing certainly, probably the number one\nthing we do with regards to identity theft\n\n401\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.855\nand trying to create opportunities for\npeople to be taken advantage of by e-mail.\n\n402\n00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:21.310\nSpoofing, pretend to\nbe somebody we're not.\n\n403\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.700\nAny or all these things, right,\ncan be done through e-mail.\n\n404\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.680\nWe would wanna see evidence of that and\ncertainly will be aware\n\n405\n00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.420\nof those things if we took a look\nat the headers on the e-mail.\n\n406\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.420\nWhat do we look for in the e-mail header\nas I showed you and talked to you?\n\n407\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.490\nThings like return path.\n\n408\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.640\nWe talked about this.\n\n409\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.010\nThe recipient's e-mail\npointed that out to you.\n\n410\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.290\nType of sending e-mail\nservice we looked at SMTP.\n\n411\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.280\nIP address in the sending server.\n\n412\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.470\nThat was there we just didn't\nbother to take a look at it.\n\n413\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.490\nName of the e-mail server.\n\n414\n00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.770\nThat was there as well.\n\n415\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.190\nTracking ID for the message.\n\n416\n00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.380\nTypically, that's there.\n\n417\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.810\nDate and time stamps, very important.\n\n418\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.880\nYou saw those.\n\n419\n00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.210\nAnd any attachment information.\n\n420\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.660\nAs I said,\nwe would capture attachments and\n\n421\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.020\nknow that there is stuff there\nthat would be of interest to us.\n\n422\n00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.220\nSo, it would be important for\nus to be aware of the fact that\n\n423\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.800\nall this information forensically is\nsitting inside of our e-mail, our inboxes.\n\n424\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.020\nI mean, how often do you think about\ndeleting something from e-mail and\n\n425\n00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.400\nsaying it's gone I don't\nhave to worry about it?\n\n426\n00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.340\nNobody's gonna see it.\n\n427\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.890\nBut the reality is we know we can go and\ngather it back.\n\n428\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.820\nAnd if this is a web based\ne-mail service like Office 365,\n\n429\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.422\nExchange Online, or Gmail,\nright, or whatever it may be.\n\n430\n00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:26.540\nOutlook.com, Hotmail.com, whatever, when\nyou delete a message, is it really gone?\n\n431\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.690\nI mean, it's gone, but\nit's still sitting on that storage array\n\n432\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.420\nin that service provider's network for\na period of time.\n\n433\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.710\nIt may take, who knows how long.\n\n434\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.110\nI don't know when they\noverwrite their data,\n\n435\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.308\nI don't know how quickly\nthey get rid of it.\n\n436\n00:19:38.308 --> 00:19:41.750\nIt may be there for seven days, there may\nbe a retention period that goes on behind\n\n437\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.910\nthe scenes as there often is in e-mail\nsystems to let you recover mail back\n\n438\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.980\nfrom what's called a secondary\nRecycle Bin or secondary storage.\n\n439\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.510\nSo that way,\n\n440\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.690\nyou have a period of time where you can\nbring them, e-mail back if you need to.\n\n441\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.190\nRemember, there's often e-discovery that\ntakes place against these systems and\n\n442\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.990\nwe may be able to go backwards in time for\na period of time and\n\n443\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.320\npull data back based on retention periods.\n\n444\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.830\nAnd investigators need to\nbe aware of these things.\n\n445\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.260\nIf your company that you are working for\nor any company that you go and\n\n446\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.800\ndo work for, does not have a published\nretention policy, then it's random.\n\n447\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.770\nYou don't know how long\ndata will be kept for.\n\n448\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.790\nBut a lot of times companies do\nhave publish retention policies,\n\n449\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.440\nyou have to be aware of\nthat as an investigator.\n\n450\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.320\nYou have to go in and\n\n451\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.708\nask the company do you have a retention\npolicy that governs retention of all data?\n\n452\n00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:29.570\nIs it e-mail only, is it files, whatever,\nthey may say, yeah, we keep data for\n\n453\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.510\n90 days.\n\n454\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.210\nWell then, in theory,\nyou can go back 90 days and find e-mail\n\n455\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.010\neven if it was deleted because the reality\nis it's gonna be stored on the server so\n\n456\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.200\nit can be recovered.\n\n457\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.150\nAnd so this is the kind of thing we\nhave to start thinking about and\n\n458\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.640\nbe aware of as investigators.\n\n459\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.940\nSo one of the most important things\nwe do is we ask questions, right?\n\n460\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.980\nWe say what are the current standards?\n\n461\n00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.460\nHow is the system configured?\n\n462\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.870\nWe may need to investigate\nby interrogating.\n\n463\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.600\nWhat I really mean by that is we may\nneed to ask questions of people,\n\n464\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.650\nusually politely,\nhopefully over coffee, right?\n\n465\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.495\nNot in a dark room or a very brightly\nlit room with a rubber hose and water.\n\n466\n00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:04.520\nBut what I'm suggesting is that a lot of\ntimes we have to sit down with the e-mail\n\n467\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.000\nadministrator, the person that\nruns the e-mail system, and\n\n468\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.040\nsay is there a retention policy?\n\n469\n00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.590\nHow is the server set up?\n\n470\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.730\nHow can we investigate and\nwhat will we find is what we wanna know.\n\n471\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.300\nAnd these are important\nthings to consider.\n\n472\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting.\n\n473\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.740\nI've actually been involved in at\nleast tertiarily in this very kind of\n\n474\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.750\nthing where a company I worked for, it was\nan insurance company, some lawyers came\n\n475\n00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.100\nin and said we want to see your e-mail\nrecords, what's your policy on retention?\n\n476\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.600\nAnd at that point in time we\ndidn't have a policy on retention.\n\n477\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Big mistake.\n\n478\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.430\n&gt;&gt; So, what does that mean?\n\n479\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.310\nWe have to give them access to everything.\n\n480\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.900\nAnd of course, from that, they said,\nwell, we're not going through this again.\n\n481\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.770\nWe learned our lesson, and\nthey said we only keep data for one year,\n\n482\n00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.504\nI think was as long as we\nwere gonna keep it on tape.\n\n483\n00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:51.330\nAd we kept no PST files, no OST files,\nthat stuff got went the way of the dodo\n\n484\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.790\non that system, because they didn't\nwanna have to go through that again.\n\n485\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.950\nIt was a lot of interference\nin our day to day operations.\n\n486\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.770\nAnd slowed things down, made us less\nproductive, because people like me were\n\n487\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.390\nworking on pulling OST files, and\nPST files out of backups from long ago\n\n488\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.162\nwhich was a real pain for me and, well,\nI didn't enjoy that, that was for sure.\n\n489\n00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.410\n&gt;&gt; Which also opens up another point\nthat we wanna think about which is\n\n490\n00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.900\nin the situation of\nthe scenario Daniel described\n\n491\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.720\nwe may show up with a e-discovery order.\n\n492\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.900\nWe talked about this in earlier episodes\nwhen we defined the federal rules of\n\n493\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.730\nevidence in the United States, talked\nabout the scope of search, jurisdiction,\n\n494\n00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.950\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n495\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.660\nWe may show up with a very narrowly\ndefined search parameter, but\n\n496\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.260\nif you give us the opportunity, right,\nbecause you don't have a very well defined\n\n497\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.530\nretention policy and we have to take all\nthe data in, in order to go through and\n\n498\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.850\nfind what we want, we may uncover other\nthings that we were not supposed to see or\n\n499\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.270\nwere not authorized to see.\n\n500\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.000\nAnd then there may be a discussion,\nindeed, let me be clear, there will be\n\n501\n00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.470\na discussion about whether or not that\ndata can then be used as the result of\n\n502\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.760\nthe initial search even though we\nwere not initially looking for it.\n\n503\n00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.860\nAnd that's not always gonna go\nin a good way or a bad way.\n\n504\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.390\nI'm not saying it's always\ngonna be used against you,\n\n505\n00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.860\nI'm not saying you're always\ngonna win that fight it excluded.\n\n506\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.880\nI'm just pointing,\n\n507\n00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.630\nyou've opened up a Pandora's box because\nnow the investigators have access to much\n\n508\n00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.860\nmore data than in theory they set out to\ndo initially have or to even discover.\n\n509\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.810\nAnd that or may not be a good thing.\n\n510\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.730\nBut the more we can constrain and\n\n511\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.160\nnarrowly define the scope of\nactivity the better off we are from\n\n512\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.970\nthe perspective of only letting\npeople see what we want them to see.\n\n513\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.930\nNow keep in mind from C H of I\nperspective we're on the exact\n\n514\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.862\nopposite end of that spectrum.\n\n515\n00:23:28.862 --> 00:23:30.240\nWe wanna see everything, right?\n\n516\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.110\nSo we want to be the people\nto get Daniel in a room and\n\n517\n00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.540\nDaniel says hey I don't really\nknow what our policy is.\n\n518\n00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.470\nAnd we say, wonderful,\n\n519\n00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.320\ncan you just give us everything you have\ncuz we need to look at everything, right?\n\n520\n00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.660\nThat would be helpful to us, but\nthat's not always gonna be the case.\n\n521\n00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.350\nAnd more importantly, it's not always\nthe most appropriate course of action.\n\n522\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.955\nSo it is very important for\nus to be aware of the boundaries\n\n523\n00:23:50.955 --> 00:23:53.775\nof how the system is configured or\nhow it's been design to operate.\n\n524\n00:23:53.775 --> 00:23:56.064\nAnd we don't have to\nessentially take control and\n\n525\n00:23:56.064 --> 00:23:58.145\nfigure out the best path\nforward as a result.\n\n526\n00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.405\nSo just some things to consider,\n\n527\n00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:01.425\nsome things to think about\nin regards to e-mail.\n\n528\n00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:04.771\nRemember, every time you have send, right,\ndigital shadow, as we talked about.\n\n529\n00:24:04.771 --> 00:24:05.768\nThere's evidence out there,\n\n530\n00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:08.540\nthere's this question whether or\nnot we're gonna com looking for it.\n\n531\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.940\nAnd if we do, what we're gonna find.\n\n532\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.460\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n533\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.730\nAnd obviously as we've seen, there's\nplenty to be forensically gathered as\n\n534\n00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.628\nevidence when it comes to\nan e-mail system itself.\n\n535\n00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:19.730\nAnd the e-mail body,\nthe headers are all there,\n\n536\n00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.910\nthere's a lot of information as\nwe've seen jacked inside of there.\n\n537\n00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.470\nMan, the first time I discovered that\nthere was header information inside of\n\n538\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:31.090\nan email, I was just gobsmacked about\nhow much information was actually there.\n\n539\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.980\nAnd of course, when we talk about things\nlike e-mail spoofing that's a great\n\n540\n00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.910\nplace to run to discern whether or\nnot that e-mail's legitimate.\n\n541\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.540\nAnd then we also have third party tools\nas well that can help us identify\n\n542\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.550\nthat as well.\n\n543\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.640\nAdam, anything else we need to\nadd to our e-mail forensics\n\n544\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.470\nshow before we close her down?\n\n545\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.900\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\nI think we pretty much covered everything.\n\n546\n00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.672\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nwe thank you so much for\n\n547\n00:24:52.672 --> 00:24:56.530\nenlightening our little minds on e-mail\nand the forensics involved therein.\n\n548\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.440\nAnd as for you guys,\nthanks for watching today.\n\n549\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.530\nIt looks like it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n550\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.160\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n551\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm an e-mail header.\n\n552\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.428\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n553\n00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:12.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n554\n00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.693\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.831\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:16.465\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.355\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.390\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CHFI series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.900\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\na man who is now full of food and\n\n8\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.170\nready to teach,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.590\nAdam, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.131\n&gt;&gt; I resemble that remark.\n\n11\n00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am good, and as Daniel said,\n\n12\n00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:35.549\nmore importantly caffeinated up,\nnot fooded up.\n\n13\n00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:36.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But of the two,\n\n14\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.130\nI think that's gonna be the more important\ndelivery sub system we have to optimize.\n\n15\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.510\nSo we're gonna talk a little\nbit about mobile forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.360\nAlways an interesting topic.\n\n17\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.700\nWe spend a lot of time, and I've talked\nabout this on some other episodes,\n\n18\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.010\nwe spend a lot of time taking things for\ngranted around us on a regular basis.\n\n19\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.960\nEverybody uses cell phones today.\n\n20\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.082\nIt's such a ubiquitous,\nsuch a common thing.\n\n21\n00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:02.366\nI remember I think I may have talked\nabout this in some of other programs and\n\n22\n00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.730\nother areas in CISSP or CASS, or\none of the other shows that I've done.\n\n23\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.060\nBut I remember years ago,\nbeing in the music business,\n\n24\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.264\nyou would know by looking at me of course.\n\n25\n00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:13.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I clean up really well when I tried,\n\n26\n00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:14.928\nbut when I was in the music business and\n\n27\n00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:19.770\nI was for many years\n&gt;&gt; I remember being in New York years ago.\n\n28\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.460\nI was working and doing some AR\nworking things for various people, and\n\n29\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.490\nI remember had one of\nthe early cell phones.\n\n30\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.580\nThat was when they came with\nthe portable battery, power subsystem.\n\n31\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.330\n&gt;&gt; The bag.\n\n32\n00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.730\n&gt;&gt; And you have the porter that\nwould carry it for you, and\n\n33\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.840\nyou have a nuclear radiation shield\nyou had to wear in order to use it.\n\n34\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.390\nAnd so I remember,\nI had the Motorola brick,\n\n35\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.090\nthose of you that are old\nenough who will remember,\n\n36\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.690\npersonal defense weapon-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Hammer and\n\n38\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.150\nsmall radiation device all in one.\n\n39\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.650\nThing's about this big,\nthat was just the antenna,\n\n40\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.030\nand then you have the phone on top of it.\n\n41\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.040\nBut I remember using,\nI was standing in Times Square, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.140\nI remember having to make a phone call.\n\n43\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.710\nI was running late for a meeting,\nI had to call a friend of mine,\n\n44\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.170\nwho I was supposed to meet\nwith at Polygram Records and\n\n45\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.270\nsay hey I'm gonna be running late for\nthis meeting, whatever, I'll be there.\n\n46\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.240\nAnd so, I'm standing in Times Square.\n\n47\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.920\nIf you can imagine Times Square if\nyou know anything about New York.\n\n48\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.600\nUnder what now is the Trinitron,\nthe huge wrap around screens.\n\n49\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.900\nBut, I was in the triangle there kind\nof in the middle, right off the street.\n\n50\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.150\nI'm standing there making a phone call and\nI'm using a cell phone.\n\n51\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.370\nAnd I vividly remember this.\n\n52\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.300\nThis is in the probably mid to late 80s.\n\n53\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.740\nAnd people around me looking\nat me as if I was this,\n\n54\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.310\nI mean you know it's almost like\nits surreal moments from a movie.\n\n55\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.820\nYou're there and\nyou're having this out of body experience\n\n56\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480\nbecause you're watching people watch\nyou and everybody is kind of stopped.\n\n57\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.020\nI mean this is New York,\nnothing stops in New York.\n\n58\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.980\nEverybody around me is kinda stopped and\nwatching and I'm trying to figure out.\n\n59\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.950\nYou know I'm there,\nI'm dressed like a leather jacket.\n\n60\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.770\n&gt;&gt; You had a booger.\n\n61\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, I was drooling,\nthat's what it was.\n\n62\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.470\nYou got something there.\n\n63\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.330\nCan you fix that?\n\n64\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.840\nLet me wipe that off for you.\n\n65\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.240\nBut you try to figure out, is it me?\n\n66\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.920\nYou know, is it what I look like?\n\n67\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.980\nI mean this is basically what I looked\nlike except it wasn't all white.\n\n68\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.290\nIt was dark and I had more of it up here.\n\n69\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.605\nBut this is me, I looked like this\nsince I was like 15 years old.\n\n70\n00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:15.500\nSo, it's not like it changed and\nI'm trying to just figure this out and\n\n71\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.180\nI'm doing my thing.\n\n72\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.140\nI'm making the phone call and\nit suddenly dawns on me\n\n73\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.440\nthat it's not that they're watching me but\nthey've never seen a cellphone.\n\n74\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.320\nThey're like, they're amazed\nby whatever I've got held up\n\n75\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.550\nto my ear here that I'm talking on\nbecause it's such an uncommon thing.\n\n76\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.450\nSo you fast forward 20 something years,\n\n77\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.650\nwhatever it was, to the last year or\ntwo, I'm in New York on business.\n\n78\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.830\nI'm essentially in the same place.\n\n79\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.470\nAnd I'm standing there making a phone\ncall, and you have one of those\n\n80\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.590\ndeja vu moments, and I just think back to\nthat, and I'm looking around as I'm making\n\n81\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.130\na phone call, and I can't spot anybody in\nthe crowd that doesn't have a cell phone.\n\n82\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n83\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.600\nwe're talking about kids,\nadults, children.\n\n84\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.330\n&gt;&gt; Now you're the weirdo if you're\nin a silver box with a phone.\n\n85\n00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm the weirdo without a cell phone.\n\n86\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.501\n&gt;&gt; They're like,\nlook at what is this thing?\n\n87\n00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:58.085\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well without\n\n88\n00:03:58.085 --> 00:03:58.585\na cell phone,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:03:58.585 --> 00:03:59.360\n&gt;&gt; I mean this is so\n\n90\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.588\nuncommon to see somebody that\ndoesn't have a cell phone today,\n\n91\n00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:03.660\nright?\nOr\n\n92\n00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.735\nheadphones coming out to go in or\nwhatever.\n\n93\n00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:08.660\nSo you think through\nsome of these episodes,\n\n94\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.295\nthese vignettes that flash in front\nof you and this is very interesting.\n\n95\n00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:15.980\nAnd as an investigator,\nthis is the kind of thing,\n\n96\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.160\nterms of mobile devices, that we have\nto focus on, we have to think about.\n\n97\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.870\nOftentimes we're called in\nto do investigative work.\n\n98\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.690\nAnd it involves computers,\nespecially in the digital forensic space.\n\n99\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.280\nThat's not unusual,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n100\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.470\nAnd we've talked about\nthe importance of that, and\n\n101\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.500\nspoken to that extensively in\nother shows and other episodes.\n\n102\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.480\nBut a lot of times a lot of information\nthat we may have to go after will be on\n\n103\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.210\na cell phone.\n\n104\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.850\nThink about what you do\nwith cell phones today.\n\n105\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.810\nWe call them smart devices.\n\n106\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.580\nDumb user smart device but\nthat's how it works.\n\n107\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.950\nAnd if you think about what you do today,\nyour pictures are probably on there,\n\n108\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.510\nvideos most likely maybe on there,\nyou may do and\n\n109\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.870\nuse the web browser or\nuse apps to do things like online banking,\n\n110\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.610\nmake purchases, you probably use\nGoogle Pay or iPay or whatever.\n\n111\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.440\nSo you may have an electronic wallet.\n\n112\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.460\nWe can track transactions there.\n\n113\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.950\nThere's a log of everything\nyou do on the phone.\n\n114\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.450\nWho you called.\n\n115\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.130\nProbably SMS messages, text messages.\n\n116\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.720\nWho you've been sending and\nreceiving to and from.\n\n117\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.180\nWebsites you've gone to on the browser.\n\n118\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.270\nInformation you may have sent back and\nforth through an application.\n\n119\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.320\nThere's a record of all this stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.320\nAnd we don't often think about this but\nyou think about the number of\n\n121\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.690\nlost cellphones that you hear\nabout that you just find.\n\n122\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.210\nI'm constantly travelling.\n\n123\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.020\nI get into a cab, I can't tell you\nthe number of times I got in and\n\n124\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.390\nsat on somebody's computer or\n\n125\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.720\ncellphone without realizing it\nbecause they left it on the back seat.\n\n126\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.700\nAnd I'm not talking about like,\nI'm sharing a cab with you.\n\n127\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.050\nI'm talking about like, there isn't\na human being in the back of the cab, and\n\n128\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.460\nyet their device is there.\n\n129\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.330\nSame thing on planes.\n\n130\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.910\nI can't tell you the number of times I've\ngotten on to a plane, sat down in a seat,\n\n131\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.750\nand there's a computer or a cell phone,\nalmost like somebody left me a present,\n\n132\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.750\nright, in the pocket of the seat or\non the seat.\n\n133\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.810\nI mean, you would think to yourself,\nhow does somebody walk away?\n\n134\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.420\nHow do you forget and\nwalk away from your computer, or whatever?\n\n135\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.780\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't know at all from\npersonal experience, at all.\n\n136\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.680\nYeah, I've done it.\n\n137\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.430\n&gt;&gt; I know you have,\nI was waiting on you to admit that.\n\n138\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI left it in a Guitar Center one time.\n\n139\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.500\n&gt;&gt; It's the glare of the lights\nthat make you think that you\n\n140\n00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.900\nhave to admit the truth, right?\n\n141\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n142\n00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:18.127\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, look into the light,\nlook into the light.\n\n143\n00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:18.760\n&gt;&gt; I'm guilty.\n\n144\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've done it, look I sympathize\nwith you, I've done it myself.\n\n145\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.500\nWhen I was in India on business.\n\n146\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.590\nI was working for Microsoft.\n\n147\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.830\nI was over there doing work.\n\n148\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.980\nI, actually, was running between flights,\nbetween, I think,\n\n149\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.360\nI was flying between Mumbai, and\nI forget where else I was going.\n\n150\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.070\nI may have been going over to,\nI don't even know.\n\n151\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.880\nI was going somewhere, I think I may\nhave been going from Delhi to Mumbai,\n\n152\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.620\nor Mumbai to Delhi or whatever it was.\n\n153\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.880\nBut I was on an internal flight, not on, I\nthink it's called Jet Airways over there,\n\n154\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.150\none of their internal\ncarriers inside the country.\n\n155\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.910\nAnd I was in the departure lounge.\n\n156\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.030\nI was doing a bunch of stuff\ntrying to get ready for a meeting.\n\n157\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.530\nThey called the plane and I grabbed,\nI thought I grabbed everything, I got\n\n158\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.000\non the plane, gets to where I'm going,\nand I realized I don't have my laptop.\n\n159\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.250\nI got the bag, I got everything, but\n\n160\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.490\nI left the laptop sitting on\nthe desk at the departure lounge.\n\n161\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.670\nLuckily, it was able to call from\nwhere we are back to the airport.\n\n162\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.400\nThey had found it, they held it.\n\n163\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.360\nI actually wound up doing\nlike whatever I was doing.\n\n164\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.325\nMade the trip back like two days later.\n\n165\n00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:20.145\nI had to go back to pick it up\nat that point, at the airport.\n\n166\n00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:21.195\nBut I was able to go pick it up.\n\n167\n00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:22.395\nThey actually had it.\n\n168\n00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:23.855\nSo I've been there and done that too.\n\n169\n00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:25.415\nI can totally sympathize with you.\n\n170\n00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:30.275\nBut the reality's just, you wonder a lot\nof times, what happens in someone's mind.\n\n171\n00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:33.005\nHow are they so\ndistracted that they forget that, right?\n\n172\n00:07:33.005 --> 00:07:34.125\nWait till you forget the kid.\n\n173\n00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:34.965\nForget about the laptop.\n\n174\n00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:35.974\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:07:35.974 --> 00:07:36.506\n&gt;&gt; Wait till you get out of\n\n176\n00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:37.215\nthe car, and forget the kid.\n\n177\n00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:38.437\n&gt;&gt; I'd never let that happen.\n\n178\n00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:39.966\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you say that now.\n\n179\n00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:40.910\nBut just wait.\n\n180\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.244\nHopefully the wife's not around,\nyou go get the kid and\n\n181\n00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:45.338\nmake a big joke out of it\nbefore they figure it out.\n\n182\n00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:49.219\nBut the reality is, right, that this stuff\nhappens and so as investigators a lot of\n\n183\n00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.503\ntimes we're called on, right,\nto figure out what's going on here.\n\n184\n00:07:52.503 --> 00:07:56.323\nSo I wanna start by breaking down what the\ncomponents of a cellular network look like\n\n185\n00:07:56.323 --> 00:07:58.849\nWe often think about, hey,\nI wanna make a phone call.\n\n186\n00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:01.640\nBut do you really stop and think about\nwhat it means to make a phone call?\n\n187\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.650\nOr do you just make a phone call?\n\n188\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.990\nI can't remember the last time I stopped\nand said, what actually goes on?\n\n189\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.850\nWhat are the moving parts?\n\n190\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.107\nWhat's the architecture\nof the cellphone network?\n\n191\n00:08:09.107 --> 00:08:10.680\nWe're gonna break that down for you.\n\n192\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.566\nWe'll talk about what the different\ntypes of cell networks are.\n\n193\n00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:16.000\nThere's over ten types you can connect to\ndepending on where you are in the world.\n\n194\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.710\nProbably important to know about that.\n\n195\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.560\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe interesting moving parts and\n\n196\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.225\npieces that identify a phone.\n\n197\n00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:26.490\nDaniel's been kind enough to volunteer his\npersonal property for demonstration, and\n\n198\n00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.330\nwe're gonna take a look some stuff there.\n\n199\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:34.090\nWe'll use the zoom in capability\nsky/sock came here in studio four.\n\n200\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.220\nAnd we'll take a look at that, and\nwe'll show you some tips and tricks.\n\n201\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.490\nI'm gonna demo a little\npiece of software for you.\n\n202\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.950\nGive you a taste of what it looks like\nto actually engage in mobile forensics,\n\n203\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.680\nin terms of the some of the new software\nwe can use to examine systems and\n\n204\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.510\ntake a look at what\ninformation we may find.\n\n205\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.410\nLet's start with the components\nof a cellular network.\n\n206\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.347\nSo do you know how many components\nof a cellular network there are?\n\n207\n00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:53.803\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue.\n\n208\n00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any idea?\n\n209\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.565\n&gt;&gt; I'll go with 19.\n\n210\n00:08:56.565 --> 00:08:57.232\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any idea?\n\n211\n00:08:57.232 --> 00:08:58.513\n&gt;&gt; I will-\n&gt;&gt; You're not supposed to\n\n212\n00:08:58.513 --> 00:08:59.035\nshow me doing that.\n\n213\n00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, how about six?\n\n214\n00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:02.251\n&gt;&gt; Six.\n&gt;&gt; Six sounds good.\n\n215\n00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.295\n&gt;&gt; 6 is right, 19 was close,\nbut 6 is better.\n\n216\n00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:06.159\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not supposed\n\n217\n00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.210\nto show them when I do this.\n\n218\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.560\nHe's not supposed to see that.\n\n219\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.190\nAll right, so six components,\nright, six components.\n\n220\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.600\nSo let's talk about what they are.\n\n221\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.610\nBecause it actually is really interesting\nwhen we start breaking down what a cell\n\n222\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.520\nnetwork looks like.\n\n223\n00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.050\nWe drive by the towers all the time, or\n\n224\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.800\nat least the antennas,\ndepending on where you are.\n\n225\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.440\nYou see them, but again,\nthey kind of blend into the background,\n\n226\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.790\nwe take them for granted.\n\n227\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.700\nThere's 20 towers every two or\nthree miles and we drive by.\n\n228\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.820\nOr there's antennas on the big\nbuildings downtown, that kind of thing.\n\n229\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.260\nWe don't often think about this.\n\n230\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.570\nBut the mobile switching center,\nthe base transceiver station,\n\n231\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:40.080\nbase station controller, base station\nsubsystem, home location register and\n\n232\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.890\nvisitor location register are all\nthe moving parts and pieces.\n\n233\n00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.190\nSo let's break those down.\n\n234\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.913\nThe mobile switching center,\nthis is the actual switching system for\n\n235\n00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:48.126\nthe cellular network itself.\n\n236\n00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:52.737\nSo this is the main area,\nlet's call it like a huge hub\n\n237\n00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:56.550\nwhere we can co-locate information gear.\n\n238\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.160\nAnd it's almost like the old base\nswitching centers, or not the base\n\n239\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.180\nswitching centers, the switching stations\nthat the phone companies would use, right?\n\n240\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.300\nWhere you would go to a regional center,\nyou'd have all the big gear coming in,\n\n241\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.400\nall the lines and all that.\n\n242\n00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.580\nSo mobile switching centers\nare essentially the same, but for\n\n243\n00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.580\nthe mobile systems.\n\n244\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.510\nThe base transceiver station is\nthe radio transceiver equipment itself.\n\n245\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.410\nThat communicates with mobile phones.\n\n246\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.280\nThis would be the tower and some of\nthe gear that's sitting in the tower and\n\n247\n00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.390\nthat information is moving back and forth.\n\n248\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.200\nThe base station controller manages\nthe transceiver's equipment and\n\n249\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.760\nassigns channels for\nyou to be able to communicate across.\n\n250\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.026\nThis is some of the gear\nyou would see in the,\n\n251\n00:10:32.026 --> 00:10:35.274\noften times if you go by a tower,\nif you've actually seen one or\n\n252\n00:10:35.274 --> 00:10:39.160\ndriven by one, you will see that there's\na little building a lot of times.\n\n253\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.970\nLooks like a small shack\nat the base of the tower.\n\n254\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.304\nThey've got battery backup and\npower and stuff running in there.\n\n255\n00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:47.270\nThey got a bunch of gear running in there.\n\n256\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.110\nThere's a bunch of different\nstuff that goes on.\n\n257\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.040\nBut some of this stuff will be\nsitting inside that building or\n\n258\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.840\nprotected from the wind and the weather or\n\n259\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.860\nwhatever in metal cabinets or containers\non the outside depending on what it is.\n\n260\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.370\nBut that's what's going on\ninside this whole area.\n\n261\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.710\nSo this manages the equipment and\n\n262\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.370\nperforms channel assignments,\nthe base station controller.\n\n263\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.410\nThe base station subsystem\nmanages the radio network and\n\n264\n00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.680\nis controlled by the mobile\nserver switching center itself.\n\n265\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.060\nSo it manages the radio network overall.\n\n266\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.650\nIt has various elements associated with\nit, the base station controller, the base\n\n267\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.271\ntransceiver station and the transcoder are\nall part of this base station subsystem.\n\n268\n00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:25.535\nSo they'd have some individual components.\n\n269\n00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:28.735\nThe home location register\nis gonna be the database.\n\n270\n00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:31.475\nThis is essentially what's at\nthe mobile switching center.\n\n271\n00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:36.095\nIt's the referencable information sent for\nrepository for all subscriber data and\n\n272\n00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.280\nservice information.\n\n273\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.500\nThis is what hackers will try to go after.\n\n274\n00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.760\nIf they can break in and\n\n275\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.400\nsteal information on customers,\nthey'll go after the location register.\n\n276\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.490\nIt's just a big database that has\nall the information on customers.\n\n277\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.330\nAnd then visit our location register.\n\n278\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.210\nAny time we put the word register at the\nend of something we're talking about data\n\n279\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.850\nand databases, just so you know.\n\n280\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.258\nThis is used in conjunction with\nthe home location register.\n\n281\n00:11:58.258 --> 00:12:02.610\nIt's a version of that database that\nwe use for users that are roaming.\n\n282\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.998\nSo in other words, when you roam between\ncell systems and/or roam between\n\n283\n00:12:05.998 --> 00:12:08.957\nindividual carriers,\nbecause you're on a different network,\n\n284\n00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:11.323\nthis is how we provide information for\nhand-off and\n\n285\n00:12:11.323 --> 00:12:14.789\ntell the other carrier who you are and\nwhat you're supposed to be able to do.\n\n286\n00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:16.380\nIt's called the visitor location register.\n\n287\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.970\nSo it's just the components that\nmake up the overall cell system.\n\n288\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.420\nWe just wanna make sure we're\naware of what they are.\n\n289\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.230\nIt may come in handy at some point.\n\n290\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.650\nYou're sitting in a bar somewhere,\nsomebody says, hey, geek trivia, rock,\n\n291\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.930\npaper, scissors, go.\n\n292\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.678\nAnd they say, what is the name\nof the visitor database or\n\n293\n00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:33.675\nthe roaming database on a cell network?\n\n294\n00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:36.412\nYou can whip that puppy out and\nearn yourself a free drink and\n\n295\n00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:39.008\nif that's the best you can do\nyou need a hobby by the way.\n\n296\n00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.179\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n297\n00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:42.142\nhow many different cell\nnetwork types are there?\n\n298\n00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:43.441\nI mentioned there's a whole bunch of them.\n\n299\n00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.509\nGlobally, there's a lot of them.\n\n300\n00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:50.870\nWe're used to in the US here, more often\nthan not, using several different ones.\n\n301\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.240\nWe've seen GSM, GPRS.\n\n302\n00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.182\nCDMA was popular for a while.\n\n303\n00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:57.590\nBut there's a lot of others that we may or\nmay not come across.\n\n304\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.070\nSo there's Global Systems for\nMobile Communications which is called GCM.\n\n305\n00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.829\nThere's General Packet Radio Service,\nGPRS.\n\n306\n00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:07.104\nThere's CDMA 1, CDMA 2000, EV-DO,\n\n307\n00:13:07.104 --> 00:13:11.990\nyou hear a little bit about that,\nEvolution-Data Optimized.\n\n308\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.970\nThere's EDGE, Enhanced Data Rates for\nGSM Evolution.\n\n309\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.720\nThere's UMTS, Universal Mobile\nTelecommunications System.\n\n310\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.130\nThere's DECT, D-E-C-T, Digital Enhanced\nCordless Teleco or Telecommunications.\n\n311\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.297\nDigital AMPS, Digital A-M-P-S.\n\n312\n00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:31.634\nThere's a i, small i, iDen, small i d-e-n.\n\n313\n00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:34.060\nAlmost like iPhone, iPod, small i.\n\n314\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.270\niDen, Integrated Digital Enhanced Network.\n\n315\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.579\nThese are some of the more popular ones.\n\n316\n00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:39.020\nThere are others.\n\n317\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.180\nYou could go out and Google,\nget a complete list.\n\n318\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.860\nGo to Wikipedia, find a list of all these.\n\n319\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.857\nThis is just one of many points of data\nwhen we talk about the kinds of things\n\n320\n00:13:47.857 --> 00:13:50.375\nthat we want to be aware\nof as an investigator.\n\n321\n00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:53.316\nNot so much, hey do you need to know\nwhat network the device is on so\n\n322\n00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:56.800\nyou can interact with it and examine it,\nprobably not that big of a deal.\n\n323\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.670\nWhen you hook the device up to software,\n\n324\n00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.090\nyou're gonna detect pretty quickly the\ninformation in the device, in the card.\n\n325\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.660\nWhether it's got a SIM card or not.\n\n326\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.810\nWhether it's built in or\nit's got on-board storage.\n\n327\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.710\nThat stuffs gonna pop up on the screen.\n\n328\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.420\nBut when we're actually looking\nto tap into a cell phone and\n\n329\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.860\nlisten to transmissions in real time,\nwhich we can do under some circumstances\n\n330\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.060\nanyway, we have to understand the kind\nof carrier network it may be on and\n\n331\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.555\nwe obviously have to work with the carrier\nunder some sort of court order to be able\n\n332\n00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:28.543\nto interdict that cell traffic and\nfind it and potentially record it.\n\n333\n00:14:28.543 --> 00:14:31.015\nWe're talking obviously about\nsomething law enforcement can do,\n\n334\n00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:33.205\nnot something an average\nindividual will be able to do.\n\n335\n00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.740\nAt least not legally anyway.\n\n336\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.656\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n337\n00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:36.458\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering, man.\n\n338\n00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.104\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well not even, if you think about it,\n\n339\n00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:43.361\nreally we're not talking about social\nengineering that would allow us to\n\n340\n00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:47.017\nnot only clone but in theory\nlisten to the phone conversation.\n\n341\n00:14:47.017 --> 00:14:50.400\nThis traffic is encrypted, it's not\nlike it's sent on the wire in the open.\n\n342\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.030\nYou're talking to somebody, but\n\n343\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.010\nthat transmission is sent\nencrypted across the wire.\n\n344\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.730\nThe cell provider encrypts that so\nthe encryption underneath end to end,\n\n345\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.850\nas we would say, is being handled by\nthe provider on the provider network.\n\n346\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.260\nYou run a firewall on that phone,\nyou run encryption software on that phone,\n\n347\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.270\nthere's usually a V running\non the system as well.\n\n348\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.940\nThese things may or\nmay not be something you're aware of, but\n\n349\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.890\nthe provider is making this stuff work,\nand making it happen.\n\n350\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.542\nThe hardware manufacturer\ndoes some of this.\n\n351\n00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.080\nEven without the cell provider\nnecessarily having to do it.\n\n352\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.078\nSo, that stuff is going on.\n\n353\n00:15:21.078 --> 00:15:24.371\nSo social engineering would be helpful\nif you wanted to get, let's say,\n\n354\n00:15:24.371 --> 00:15:26.561\nthe PIN to be able to get\nin to the device, right?\n\n355\n00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:30.490\nTo actually take physical control of it,\nand loot at what's there.\n\n356\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.620\nBut to tap in to,\n\n357\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.170\nto essentially record that transmission--\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking about posing as law\n\n358\n00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.180\nenforcement to get them to-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you could do that.\n\n359\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.890\n&gt;&gt; Allow me access.\n\n360\n00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.611\n&gt;&gt; You could but, in theory, think about\nthat, it's unlikely that the provider\n\n361\n00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:47.015\nwould be tricked into thinking that\nyou're a law enforcement officer.\n\n362\n00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:47.660\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n363\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.345\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're very convincing.\n\n364\n00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:48.846\n&gt;&gt; I could be good at it.\n\n365\n00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:50.165\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that could happen.\n\n366\n00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:52.025\nI mean, that could, that could happen.\n\n367\n00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.150\nYou're very right to say\nthat is a possibility.\n\n368\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.037\nSo, we will be visiting Daniel.\n\n369\n00:15:56.037 --> 00:15:57.280\nWe're gonna organize field trips.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.383\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna visit him in jail, just so\n\n371\n00:15:59.383 --> 00:16:02.197\nyou know,\nafter he does this Did you ever see those-\n\n372\n00:16:02.197 --> 00:16:03.529\n&gt;&gt; They did it for Kevin Mitnick.\n\n373\n00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well, they also arrested him.\n\n374\n00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:06.194\n&gt;&gt; They did do that.\n\n375\n00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:07.941\n&gt;&gt; Put him in jail for several years,\n\n376\n00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.440\nalthough now he's a very\nsuccessful speaker and writer.\n\n377\n00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.450\nAnd they also barred him from using\ncomputers for quite some time afterwards.\n\n378\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:20.100\nSo there may be some negative fall out\nfrom that on, you a Howard Stern fan?\n\n379\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.017\n&gt;&gt; Not really, no.\n\n380\n00:16:21.017 --> 00:16:22.738\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\nyou're at least familiar with the concept.\n\n381\n00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:26.703\nAll right, so I'm not a big fan either,\nbut the reason I mention it is, you'll,\n\n382\n00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:30.498\nat least at one point, I don't really\nfollow his shows or anything like that,\n\n383\n00:16:30.498 --> 00:16:33.512\nbut I remember I've heard or\nseen a few of them here and there.\n\n384\n00:16:33.512 --> 00:16:36.643\nBut he has like minions, or at least at\none point he did, early on his career\n\n385\n00:16:36.643 --> 00:16:39.725\nwhen he was really kind of coming up and\nthen became really popular.\n\n386\n00:16:39.725 --> 00:16:43.595\nThat would go and do crazy human tricks\nand stuff, like interview people or\n\n387\n00:16:43.595 --> 00:16:45.490\ndo crazy stupid stuff.\n\n388\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.110\nBut he would have people that he would\nsay, okay, hey, I want you to go here and\n\n389\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.150\ndo this, or pretend to be this person,\nor whatever.\n\n390\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.110\nDon't be one of those people.\n\n391\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't be one of those people.\n\n392\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.490\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna impersonate\nlaw enforcement officials.\n\n393\n00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.410\n&gt;&gt; It's usually a bad idea.\n\n394\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.240\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely a bad idea.\n\n395\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.650\nWe're not condoning that behavior,\n[LAUGH] just to be clear.\n\n396\n00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.382\nEven though, in theory,\nit may be possible, just understand that.\n\n397\n00:17:05.382 --> 00:17:08.990\nAll right, so we talked about defining\nforensics in a variety of ways,\n\n398\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.310\ntalked about digital forensics,\ntalked about defining what that is.\n\n399\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.550\nMobile forensics, simply forensics used to\nrecover mobile data from a mobile device.\n\n400\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.313\nIt will forensically sound that or\nsame idea, same definition,\n\n401\n00:17:19.313 --> 00:17:22.881\njust insert the word mobile there, instead\nof computers, instead of digital, and\n\n402\n00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.804\nit's the same idea.\n\n403\n00:17:23.804 --> 00:17:26.943\nWhat are the kind of things we\nwould often be able to capture that\n\n404\n00:17:26.943 --> 00:17:28.433\nget recovered from a system?\n\n405\n00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:31.216\nWhy don't we take a look real quick\nat some software, let's just do this,\n\n406\n00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.169\nthen we'll take a look at\nwhat we may be able to find.\n\n407\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.929\nGonna open this up,\nthis is going to be mobile edit forensics,\n\n408\n00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:42.330\nit's currently version 8.7, I think\nit's the newest version they have out.\n\n409\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.380\nThis is the oldest mobile forensics\nplatform software provider,\n\n410\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.940\nfirst one in market\nyears ago with the tool.\n\n411\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.057\nThey've got the widest deployed user base,\n\n412\n00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:53.681\nthey're the most widely used\ntool in the market today.\n\n413\n00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:57.165\nThere are many, many tools, but this one\nis kind of at the top of the food chain,\n\n414\n00:17:57.165 --> 00:17:58.440\njust so you know.\n\n415\n00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.344\nWe're not gonna do a live demo on this\nbecause we're not gonna hook up an actual\n\n416\n00:18:01.344 --> 00:18:02.762\nmobile device into the environment.\n\n417\n00:18:02.762 --> 00:18:05.950\nWe're just gonna show you what\nthe front end tools look like.\n\n418\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.830\nBut mobile edit is the forensic\ntool of choice in this area.\n\n419\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.090\nThere are many other vendors.\n\n420\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.920\nOxygen, the Oxygen Forensic Sweep,\n\n421\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.090\nfor instance, we mentioned in one or\ntwo episodes, also has stuff.\n\n422\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.050\nThere is another tool that I have loaded\nup here, we're not gonna really use.\n\n423\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.270\nBut Cell Phone Analyzer,\nCPA, is another popular one.\n\n424\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.300\nYou could see there's\na whole bunch of these.\n\n425\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.830\nBut you'll see we can go in and\nconnect up a phone.\n\n426\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.294\nRight now, it says no phone connected.\n\n427\n00:18:30.294 --> 00:18:32.970\nConnect your phone automatically,\nit'll pop in.\n\n428\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.612\nSo if I have a SIM cable,\nI can hook the phone up.\n\n429\n00:18:35.612 --> 00:18:39.568\nIt'll start interrogating the phone and\nshow me all of the different information.\n\n430\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.118\nI could do a SIM clone down here.\n\n431\n00:18:42.118 --> 00:18:45.226\nCould we go full screen just to maybe\nable to see a little bit more detail\n\n432\n00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:45.945\nthere, yeah.\n\n433\n00:18:45.945 --> 00:18:50.210\nSo SIM clone, we can go ahead and\ndo a hex dump to get the actual memory.\n\n434\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.640\nWe could do a forensics report, do\nPhoto Viewer, see all the photos on there.\n\n435\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.660\nWe can go in, and if you take a look,\nI know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n436\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.200\nThe color scheme is not optimal [LAUGH] on\nthis with the dark black background and\n\n437\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.430\nthe light blue text.\n\n438\n00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.520\nI'll read through the list,\nbut you're over here for\n\n439\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.710\ncomplete data extraction from phones and\nSIM cards.\n\n440\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.200\nWhat we get is you could list\na view of the phone content, so\n\n441\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.710\nwe could see all the data.\n\n442\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.450\nWe can do a phone connection, so it's very\neasy to connect up the phone, as I said,\n\n443\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.050\na simple sync cord.\n\n444\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.370\nAnd you connect the phone,\nand it will detect the phone.\n\n445\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.004\nWe have a SIM analyzer built right in,\nso we can analyze the SIM card.\n\n446\n00:19:26.004 --> 00:19:29.040\nWe're gonna show you a SIM card and\ntalk about that in a little bit.\n\n447\n00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.550\nWe could do lockdown bypass, so we could\nbypass the lockout code on the iOS.\n\n448\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.410\nSo we can get around that.\n\n449\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.230\nFunny that the FBI didn't\nknow how to do that.\n\n450\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.161\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] They couldn't\nhave just got the software?\n\n451\n00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:41.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm thinking there was more\nto that story than they're letting on.\n\n452\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.110\nIntegrated SIM cloning tool, so\nwe can actually clone the SIM card.\n\n453\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.960\nWe can connect phones via cable,\nBluetooth, or Wi-Fi.\n\n454\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.380\nAs I said, very easy to connect, so\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n455\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.660\nWe support just about any kind of phone\nmodel that's out there in the world today\n\n456\n00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.860\nwith this kind of tool.\n\n457\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.400\nThousands of phones that are supported\ncurrently, and when we go to connect,\n\n458\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.780\nif we click connect,\nthe interface is pretty straightforward.\n\n459\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.850\nWe're not gonna connect one up,\nbut just to show you.\n\n460\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.010\nWe've got the Apple phone there,\nwe've got Android, and then of course,\n\n461\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:09.990\nwe have other.\n\n462\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.590\nI would fall into the other category for\nthe Blackberry.\n\n463\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.530\nSo we have that.\n\n464\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.380\nBut mobile cloud, data files, SIM card\nreader, you have some options here.\n\n465\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.550\nLike most vendors today,\nthey've got a cloud-based server, so\n\n466\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.890\nyou can do this over the cloud.\n\n467\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.230\nSo mobile forensics as a service, MFAS, or\n\n468\n00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.260\nMFAS, or Mufasa, depending on your\npoint of reference, I suppose.\n\n469\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.360\nSo we could do any of those.\n\n470\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.000\nSo you would choose whatever it is, right?\n\n471\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.216\nWe could then go ahead and say, okay,\nhey, data file, or SIM card, or whatever,\n\n472\n00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:41.286\nright, and we wanna import the files, so\nwe can do an import there if we want to.\n\n473\n00:20:41.286 --> 00:20:45.395\nIf we're gonna do a data file transfer,\nwe can do that.\n\n474\n00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:48.215\nSo we have to go grab the file\nif we have it prerecorded,\n\n475\n00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:50.625\nmaybe we've already grabbed the file,\nwe're gonna just bring it in here and\n\n476\n00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.225\nbreak it down and you'll open it up.\n\n477\n00:20:52.225 --> 00:20:54.815\nSo we can do that,\nit wouldn't be too hard to do.\n\n478\n00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:59.480\nWe could go ahead and if we do mobile\ncloud, we have to specify the logon for\n\n479\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.000\nthe cloud, we would have already\nset up an account, of course.\n\n480\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.340\nAnd if we were going to do\nSIM card reader, Right?\n\n481\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.960\nThen we'll bring in the SIM card,\nit's gonna detect,\n\n482\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.540\nsee if we could find the loaded SIM card.\n\n483\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.840\nWe're not gonna obviously find one.\n\n484\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.080\nBut if we had something hooked up,\nif there was a phone that was connected,\n\n485\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.150\nwe would then be able to be interrogating\nit and seeing there's a SIM card.\n\n486\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.370\nLet's see if we can get into it,\nlet's see if we can read it.\n\n487\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.850\nWe'd be able to do that here.\n\n488\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.310\nSo this is the kind of stuff\nthat this kind of a tool can do.\n\n489\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.940\nIt's gonna eventually just come up and\nsay hey, sorry,\n\n490\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.600\nwe don't find any SIM cards, so\nwe'll just cancel out of that.\n\n491\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.120\nBut you've got the general idea,\nwe can go in and do that.\n\n492\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.738\nWe can use the Hex dump area here,\nand you'll see we can go in,\n\n493\n00:21:36.738 --> 00:21:38.209\nwe can load up a Hex file.\n\n494\n00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:42.645\nAnd we can actually look on the desktop of\na machine to pull in Hex if we need to so\n\n495\n00:21:42.645 --> 00:21:45.200\nwe can read the Hex file from the phone.\n\n496\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.817\nAnd, or from your Windows machine or\nany kind of machine, pretty easy to do.\n\n497\n00:21:48.817 --> 00:21:50.980\nWe can do a SIM clone.\n\n498\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.960\nWe can actually go in,\n\n499\n00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.340\nand we have to install the drivers\nto get the cloning to work.\n\n500\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.963\nBut we can install the SIM card\ndrivers and clone a SIM card,\n\n501\n00:21:56.963 --> 00:22:00.074\nmaking a forensically sound copy of it,\nwhich then we could examine.\n\n502\n00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:02.485\nSo remember,\nwe never work with the original.\n\n503\n00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:03.975\nWe always work with a duplicate.\n\n504\n00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:07.945\nSo with a SIM card essentially, we're\ngonna wanna clone that information, and\n\n505\n00:22:07.945 --> 00:22:08.835\nwork with a copy of it.\n\n506\n00:22:08.835 --> 00:22:10.885\nSo we could do that as well if we want to.\n\n507\n00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:12.735\nSo it's actually pretty powerful.\n\n508\n00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:15.115\nThere we go, yes, I know it's not there,\nthank you very much.\n\n509\n00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:19.187\nPretty powerful tool that allows us\nto go in to interrogate the device.\n\n510\n00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:23.352\nSo, you'll be getting all this kind of\nstuff, call history, SIM card information,\n\n511\n00:22:23.352 --> 00:22:26.159\nphonebook information,\nsubscriber and equipment IDs.\n\n512\n00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:30.232\nWe're gonna talk about what those are and\nshow those to you in just a minute,\n\n513\n00:22:30.232 --> 00:22:34.371\nSMS information text, as I said back and\nforth, GPS and Internet settings,\n\n514\n00:22:34.371 --> 00:22:37.790\nbe able to pull the cache out\nof the phone and see all that.\n\n515\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.820\nPhotos, videos, I mean, imagine all\nthe stuff you have on your phone.\n\n516\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.740\nYou just think about that and\nthe kind of stuff you may see.\n\n517\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.300\nAny and\nall that stuff's gonna come in here.\n\n518\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.490\nSo it's a really interesting tool, right?\n\n519\n00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:51.941\nIt's gonna help us to be very proactive\nin terms of being an investigator,\n\n520\n00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:54.025\nbeing able to go in and\nlook that kind of stuff.\n\n521\n00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:58.173\nLet's look at one more, a little\ndifferent take on the same idea, CFA,\n\n522\n00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:03.065\nCellphone Analyzer, you'll see here that\nthis is just telling us it's a demo.\n\n523\n00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:06.135\nSo we're gonna go in, we're gonna set\nup the analysis type we wanna use,\n\n524\n00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:07.105\nkinda similar.\n\n525\n00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:10.595\nWe'll then go ahead and extract the data\nfrom the device once it's been hooked up.\n\n526\n00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:15.480\nSo we'll go in here, and\nwe'll be asked, what are we gonna do?\n\n527\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.450\nAre we gonna use a SIM card, are we doing\nmobile phone file, a kind of a data dump?\n\n528\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.770\nAre we gonna acquire the device\ncuz it's already hooked up?\n\n529\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.810\nSo the tools more or\n\n530\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.380\nless work the same way conceptually in the\nsense that we have to provide the input.\n\n531\n00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.799\nAnd then based on that, we're then\nable to go ahead and examine it.\n\n532\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.040\nSo we'll be able to do this as well,\nthis is just one of many\n\n533\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.200\ndifferent programs that\nessentially do the same thing.\n\n534\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.610\nSo just giving you a sense of\nthe kinda stuff that we would look at,\n\n535\n00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.320\nand obviously, don't forget, of course,\nemails would be grabbed as well here,\n\n536\n00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.330\nusing this kinda information if\nthere are emails resident in there.\n\n537\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.030\nSo yeah, we talked a bit about the SIM\ncard and what the SIM card is and\n\n538\n00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.730\nhow we can get information from it.\n\n539\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.645\nThe SIM card essentially authenticates the\nuser of the cell phone against the network\n\n540\n00:23:54.645 --> 00:23:55.850\nthey're connecting to.\n\n541\n00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.145\nRight, this gives you access\nto subscribe services.\n\n542\n00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:02.938\nIt's like a little swipe card, a digital\nID that you use where you put your card in\n\n543\n00:24:02.938 --> 00:24:07.610\nand it reads the digital identity off\nthe chip and allows you to authenticate.\n\n544\n00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.770\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna want, as investigators,\n\n545\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.350\nto be able to look at that sim card and\nfind the information.\n\n546\n00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.350\nWe're gonna take a look at what\none looks like here in a minute,\n\n547\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.820\ngot a little demo set up for you.\n\n548\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.114\nBut remember, the SIM card is\ngonna be an electronic vault.\n\n549\n00:24:20.114 --> 00:24:23.306\nIt's a repository of subscriber data,\nand as a result of that,\n\n550\n00:24:23.306 --> 00:24:24.673\nit has its own file system.\n\n551\n00:24:24.673 --> 00:24:26.830\nThe file system is in non-volatile memory.\n\n552\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.110\nIt's stored on the card itself in ROM and\nthat way, it's just essentially\n\n553\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.900\nwe're not gonna worry about it getting\nwiped out when we power the system down.\n\n554\n00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.730\nSo how we get data from a sim card,\nI essentially just showed you in the tool.\n\n555\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.120\nWe're gonna hook up the sim card and\nwe're gonna then be able to read it, but\n\n556\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.960\nthe thing we gotta be aware of is\nthat the sim card is not so simple.\n\n557\n00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.140\nIt's not just plug it in and\nboom we read it.\n\n558\n00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.230\nSim cards are protected with\nself-destruction devices and\n\n559\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.820\nwe have to understand\nhow to deactivate them.\n\n560\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.330\nOtherwise, we're essentially\ngonna lock out the card and\n\n561\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.600\nnot be able to get any data from it.\n\n562\n00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.484\nNow, this is the problem the FBI ran into.\n\n563\n00:24:59.484 --> 00:25:02.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; With regards to getting into the phone,\n\n564\n00:25:02.002 --> 00:25:05.512\nthe Apple, the iPhone,\nthat was all the news and all, actually,\n\n565\n00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:08.539\nit was the year anniversary\nof that yesterday, I think.\n\n566\n00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:10.458\n&gt;&gt; Was it really?\n&gt;&gt; Saw something on the news, yeah.\n\n567\n00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:12.780\nCuz we were outside,\nwe were kinda waiting on coffee.\n\n568\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.174\nAnd they had a runner up on the CNN or\nwhatever it was.\n\n569\n00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:19.619\nBut they were talking about the fact that\nit's a year later since the attack in\n\n570\n00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:20.422\nSan Bernardino.\n\n571\n00:25:20.422 --> 00:25:21.640\nSo I didn't realize it\nhad been a year already.\n\n572\n00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.308\n&gt;&gt; I can't believe it.\n\n573\n00:25:22.308 --> 00:25:22.827\n&gt;&gt; That's just kinda crazy.\n\n574\n00:25:22.827 --> 00:25:23.640\n&gt;&gt; God bless.\n\n575\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's a SIM card,\n\n576\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.420\nto access the SIM card,\nyou need a PIN to be able to get in.\n\n577\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.790\nThat's the PIN you normally put in, right,\nto the device that unlocks the device and,\n\n578\n00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.740\nor is gonna let you have access.\n\n579\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.250\nNow this is where the FBI ran into\nproblems with getting into the phone.\n\n580\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.590\nNow it's not as simple, we were joking\naround a minute ago, saying, well, look,\n\n581\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.620\nthere's a line in the tool,\nit says, just bypass the iOS SIM.\n\n582\n00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.700\nIt's not that simple.\n\n583\n00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.530\nYou can't just use a tool like that and\nimmediately bypass it.\n\n584\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.841\nYou get several chances.\n\n585\n00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:50.836\nIf you get it wrong,\nyou lock out the phone.\n\n586\n00:25:50.836 --> 00:25:52.337\nThis is one of the issues that we have.\n\n587\n00:25:52.337 --> 00:25:56.898\nIf you don't enter the valid pin in three\nattempts, we block access to the card and\n\n588\n00:25:56.898 --> 00:26:00.375\nthen you need what's called and\neight digit PUK, a P-U-K.\n\n589\n00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:02.515\nPersonal unlock number has to be entered.\n\n590\n00:26:02.515 --> 00:26:06.540\nProblem is that the user of\nthe phone doesn't know the PUK,\n\n591\n00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.127\nit was provided by the network owner.\n\n592\n00:26:09.127 --> 00:26:13.186\nIn other words, Verizon, Apple,\nwhoever owns the network in the phone,\n\n593\n00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:17.535\nthe manufacturer, actually knows the PUK,\nit's not known to the user.\n\n594\n00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:18.995\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n595\n00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:23.140\nif we don't don't actually have the PUK\nto unlock the PIN, then we can't get in.\n\n596\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.915\nIf we don't get the correct PUK in ten\nattempts, the sim is permanently disabled.\n\n597\n00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:32.870\nSo then at that point, while in theory\nthere's always a way to get in,\n\n598\n00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.640\nfrom your perspective, we assume that\nthere's no longer access to the data.\n\n599\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.250\nThis is what the FBI ran up against and\nwhat they were concerned about with\n\n600\n00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.060\nregards to this, because had they entered\nthe code incorrectly too many times,\n\n601\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.360\nthey were gonna lock it out and\nthat was gonna be a problem.\n\n602\n00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat they ultimately bypassed apparently.\n\n603\n00:26:48.491 --> 00:26:51.735\n&gt;&gt; Well, they did, they got the NSA\ninvolved and they actually went ahead and\n\n604\n00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:55.255\nthey figured out a way to crack it without\nhaving to get Apple to cough up the PUK.\n\n605\n00:26:55.255 --> 00:26:57.450\nSo, that's the story anyway.\n\n606\n00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.870\nWhat really happened,\nI think they had a rubber mallet.\n\n607\n00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:00.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] it's all they needed.\n\n608\n00:27:00.858 --> 00:27:02.402\n&gt;&gt; It's the ultimate weapon and\n\n609\n00:27:02.402 --> 00:27:05.312\nI think they just beat the hell\nout of it until it gave up.\n\n610\n00:27:05.312 --> 00:27:09.110\nBut they actually wound up finding\na weakness that they did not disclose.\n\n611\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.290\nBut they found a weakness that allowed\nthem to get around the architecture of\n\n612\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.420\nthat particular system and allowed the NSA\na way to get in and actually be able\n\n613\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.820\nto find the data without having to get\nApple to cough up the access code.\n\n614\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.721\nAt least that's the story\nthey went with publicly.\n\n615\n00:27:22.721 --> 00:27:24.731\nPrivately, who knows whether they\nactually did or not, it's hard to say.\n\n616\n00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:27.238\n&gt;&gt; The good old never say anything agency.\n\n617\n00:27:27.238 --> 00:27:29.508\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, you know, that's-\n\n618\n00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:30.074\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] They're not\n\n619\n00:27:30.074 --> 00:27:30.756\ntelling you how they did it.\n\n620\n00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:33.757\n&gt;&gt; No, they're just, they're saying\nthey did, they're not saying how.\n\n621\n00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:35.166\nSo we have some interesting information.\n\n622\n00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:38.302\nWe're gonna look at what a SIM card\nlooks in a minute Before we do that,\n\n623\n00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:42.320\nwe have to think about what's known as\nthe ICC ID, integrated circuit card id.\n\n624\n00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.510\nThis the ID that identifies\nthe sim uniquely.\n\n625\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.000\nIt's usually up to a 20\ndigit alphanumeric string.\n\n626\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.320\nWe're gonna take a look at that and\nshow you what that is.\n\n627\n00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.500\nIf we can't find it cuz it's not out on\nthe outside of the card, forensic software\n\n628\n00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.500\nlike Mobile Editor, whatever we're\ngonna use can typically read that.\n\n629\n00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.510\nA lot of times you will get the ICC ID\nby interrogating the card, but\n\n630\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.820\nit may not be printed on the outside.\n\n631\n00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.982\nYours happens to be,\nwe're gonna take a look at yours,\n\n632\n00:28:05.982 --> 00:28:09.165\nyours is nice cuz AT&amp;T's nice, so it's\nprinted [LAUGH] on the outside of theirs.\n\n633\n00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:12.080\nBut many SIM cards don't\nhave it on the outside.\n\n634\n00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.114\nAnd so as a result, you have to\nactually plug it into a reader and\n\n635\n00:28:15.114 --> 00:28:15.987\nthen find the ID.\n\n636\n00:28:15.987 --> 00:28:17.960\nSo we're gonna take a look at that,\nwe'll show you how to do that.\n\n637\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.730\nWe also have what's known as the IMEI, the\nInternational Mobile Equipment Identifier.\n\n638\n00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:27.378\nThis is a 15-digit number that identifies\nthe phone manufacturer, make, model.\n\n639\n00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:30.441\nAnd there's a database of these\nthings you can go out and track for\n\n640\n00:28:30.441 --> 00:28:33.239\nGSM devices and\nfigure out where it's been manufactured.\n\n641\n00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:34.720\nWe're gonna take a look at that as well.\n\n642\n00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.770\nWe also have what's known as the ESN.\n\n643\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:43.438\nThe electronic serial number, that's gonna\ntypically be a 32 digit unique identifier.\n\n644\n00:28:43.438 --> 00:28:44.150\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n645\n00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:44.857\nGood job!\n\n646\n00:28:44.857 --> 00:28:47.628\n&gt;&gt; And that's gonna be on the phone,\nand we'll take a look at that as well.\n\n647\n00:28:47.628 --> 00:28:49.340\nIt's actually kind of like a Mac address.\n\n648\n00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.246\nThe first eight to fourteen bits\nidentifies the manufacturer of that\n\n649\n00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.710\ndevice, much like a MAC address does.\n\n650\n00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.160\nAnd the remaining bits identify\nthe assigned serial number.\n\n651\n00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.478\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat all these things.\n\n652\n00:28:59.478 --> 00:29:03.900\nSo could we go to Sock-Cam one and\ndo an aerial footage show?\n\n653\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.739\nOkay, so we're gonna zoom in a little bit.\n\n654\n00:29:05.739 --> 00:29:07.900\nWhat we did is we set\nup Daniel's cellphone.\n\n655\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.599\nWe actually, he was kind enough\nto volunteer his device.\n\n656\n00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:14.934\nSo we took it apart and we just opened\nup the battery bay in the back, took\n\n657\n00:29:14.934 --> 00:29:19.950\nthe battery out, which is where you will\noften find the identifier information.\n\n658\n00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.560\nA little label that's usually\nslapped on in the phone there.\n\n659\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.450\nYou could see that, and\nwe took the sim card out.\n\n660\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:30.310\nIt's normally sitting in the bay\nright over here, right, right there.\n\n661\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.210\nWe just took it out and we just put\nit right there so you can see it, so\n\n662\n00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.210\nthat way it's a little bit easier to see.\n\n663\n00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.510\nSo I just wanna point out what they are.\n\n664\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.040\nSo the SIM card is sitting on the bottom,\n\n665\n00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.860\nand you could see that it's\na little plastic card.\n\n666\n00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.702\nIt's not very big, it's not much bigger\nthan basically your fingernail, right?\n\n667\n00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:49.408\nAnd we flipped it over so\nyou could see the identifier on it.\n\n668\n00:29:49.408 --> 00:29:52.670\nSo this is the ICC ID that's there.\n\n669\n00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.690\nThe numbers that are listed there.\n\n670\n00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.440\nBut if you flip it over on the back,\n\n671\n00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.960\nit's just got a bunch of just metal and\nlet's just flip that over real quick.\n\n672\n00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.945\nMy god, it's Godzilla.\n\n673\n00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:05.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we flip that back over,\n\n674\n00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.250\nit's just got some copper\ncontacts on the back.\n\n675\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.570\nIt goes into the reader and\nmake the connection there.\n\n676\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.727\nAnd you're able to essentially see and\ninteract with and read the data.\n\n677\n00:30:13.727 --> 00:30:14.580\nSo that's just what we have.\n\n678\n00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.928\nIt's like a little plastic\nchip with a chip embedded in.\n\n679\n00:30:17.928 --> 00:30:20.028\nA little plastic card with\na chip embedded in it.\n\n680\n00:30:20.028 --> 00:30:22.790\nMy god, look, wait, there's a-\n&gt;&gt; You're making a show.\n\n681\n00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.558\n&gt;&gt; An eclipse.\n\n682\n00:30:23.558 --> 00:30:25.490\nMy god!\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n683\n00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.233\n&gt;&gt; The natives are running around.\n\n684\n00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:28.830\nMy god, it's the end of the world.\n\n685\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.870\nAll right, so we could see the phone\nmanufacturer there, Samsung.\n\n686\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.160\nWe could see the model.\n\n687\n00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.423\nWe could see the FCC ID.\n\n688\n00:30:36.423 --> 00:30:39.771\nWe could see for information call,\nI'm glad to see it doesn't say for\n\n689\n00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.659\na good time call or anything like that.\n\n690\n00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:43.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n691\n00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.401\n&gt;&gt; The IMEI is there.\n\n692\n00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:45.610\nWe were just talking about that.\n\n693\n00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.349\nThe international mobile equipment\nidentifier, so could can see that.\n\n694\n00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:51.042\nRemember, we break that down or\n\n695\n00:30:51.042 --> 00:30:55.260\nthat's gonna tell us essentially\nthe manufacturer of the information.\n\n696\n00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.440\nThere's a database of those for\nGSM phones.\n\n697\n00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.420\nThere's a bar code to scan,\nserial numbers there, you could see that.\n\n698\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.070\nThere's a SKU,\nwhich has nothing to do with us,\n\n699\n00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:08.090\nit's just the stock keeping unit\ntracking number for the manufacturer.\n\n700\n00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.653\nThis was made in Korea.\n\n701\n00:31:09.653 --> 00:31:12.550\nIt's got 32 gigs of\nonboard memory apparently.\n\n702\n00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.220\nAnd it's got just information\nabout the device itself.\n\n703\n00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.560\nSo we can see all of that\ninformation just by looking at\n\n704\n00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.930\nthe tag on the back of the device,\ntypically, more often than not.\n\n705\n00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:28.040\nNow, the challenge associated\nwith this is that in order\n\n706\n00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.380\nto get this information this way, we had\nto take the phone cover off the back,\n\n707\n00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.490\nbut we also took the battery\nout of the phone.\n\n708\n00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.410\nWhich means you had to shut the phone\noff as we were talking about, right?\n\n709\n00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.460\nCuz I said, you're gonna do that.\n\n710\n00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.610\nYou're like, yeah,\nI'll just shut the phone off, no big deal.\n\n711\n00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.388\nAnd so you did that.\n\n712\n00:31:41.388 --> 00:31:49.160\nAny volatile dat that was in the phone has\nbeen lost because we shut the phone off.\n\n713\n00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.520\nSo we have to be aware of that.\n\n714\n00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.717\nNow, the non-volatile storage\non the SIM card is still there.\n\n715\n00:31:53.717 --> 00:31:56.383\nWhen we plug that back in,\nwhen Daniel plugs back in his SIM card,\n\n716\n00:31:56.383 --> 00:31:59.145\nputs his battery back in,\nhis phone's gonna re-authenticate and\n\n717\n00:31:59.145 --> 00:32:01.040\nconnect back to network with no trouble.\n\n718\n00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.627\nYou're not gonna lose that data.\n\n719\n00:32:02.627 --> 00:32:04.725\nBut anyway it was in\nthe memory of the phone,\n\n720\n00:32:04.725 --> 00:32:07.011\nthose 32 gigs of memory\nis essentially gone.\n\n721\n00:32:07.011 --> 00:32:08.390\nWe don't know what was there.\n\n722\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.940\nSo you would just have to\nthink about the fact that\n\n723\n00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.080\nas an investigator-\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n724\n00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.090\n&gt;&gt; We want to see that information on that\nlabel, but if we take the phone apart and\n\n725\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.140\nshut it off,\nwe lost everything in the phone.\n\n726\n00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.220\nWe've got to record everything\nfirst before we do that.\n\n727\n00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming there's some sort of\ntechniques involved with keeping power\n\n728\n00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.610\nwhile you can pull a battery out.\n\n729\n00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.440\nMaybe you had some leads or\nwhatever, or trying to-\n\n730\n00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Depending on the phone.\n\n731\n00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Hack around.\n&gt;&gt; So so in other words,\n\n732\n00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.380\nmost of our phones will be able to be\ncharged through an external charging\n\n733\n00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.970\nport, right.\n\n734\n00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.670\nMore often in the night,\nyou plug it into the wall.\n\n735\n00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.620\nSo you would be able to put the phone and\ncharger in our toolkit again.\n\n736\n00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.460\nTypically something we'd\ncarry around with us.\n\n737\n00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.253\nWe'd have chargers, so\nyou'd be able to plug it into the wall.\n\n738\n00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:46.833\nAnd then you would be able to remove the\nbattery so that the phone stays connected\n\n739\n00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:49.460\nand has power even though\nyou pulled the battery out.\n\n740\n00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.200\nNow that's not for\nevery device because Apple devices,\n\n741\n00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.330\nyou don't have the ability to pull the\nbattery out because it's all built-in to\n\n742\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.350\nthe back of the device and\nall kind of one piece.\n\n743\n00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.690\nSo you'll have to attack an Apple\ndevice slightly differently.\n\n744\n00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.640\nBut you know for\nany of these devices, my Blackberry,\n\n745\n00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.500\nyour phone, etc., we could do that.\n\n746\n00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.172\nNow my Blackberry doesn't use a SIM card,\nso we have SIM information, but\n\n747\n00:33:09.172 --> 00:33:11.344\nit's integrated into the phone directly.\n\n748\n00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:12.440\nI don't have a SIM card.\n\n749\n00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.010\nSo if you open up my Blackberry,\nI could pull the battery out,\n\n750\n00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.520\nI would see a tag like that.\n\n751\n00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.614\nBut you wouldn't see a SIM card in mine.\n\n752\n00:33:17.614 --> 00:33:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n753\n00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.340\n&gt;&gt; So it just depends on who\nyou buy the device from and\n\n754\n00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.110\nwhere it's manufactured and\nwhat network it's gonna go on.\n\n755\n00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.970\nSo it's just interesting when you\ntake a look at some of that stuff and\n\n756\n00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.220\nyou start to begin to drill in and\nsee what's there.\n\n757\n00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.660\nSo let's wrap up our\nconversation in this area, but\n\n758\n00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.140\njust quickly talk about the mobile\ndevice forensic process is.\n\n759\n00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.700\nWe kinda hinted at this and\ntalked about the edges of it, but\n\n760\n00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.600\nlet's just formally go through it and\nlist it.\n\n761\n00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.650\nIt's not gonna surprise you.\n\n762\n00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.210\nWe've talked about forensic\nprocesses in all these other areas.\n\n763\n00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.780\nIt's gonna basically be the same.\n\n764\n00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.300\nJust put the word mobile\nin front of whatever we do.\n\n765\n00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.317\nSo we're to collect evidence, document the\nscene and of course and preserve evidence.\n\n766\n00:33:51.317 --> 00:33:52.263\nImaging profiles, so\n\n767\n00:33:52.263 --> 00:33:55.208\nwe've talked about gathering\nthe dynamic data that's on the phone.\n\n768\n00:33:55.208 --> 00:33:59.588\nAcquire information and then report, we've\ntalked about all these steps in multiple\n\n769\n00:33:59.588 --> 00:34:01.930\nareas, in other episodes, other shows.\n\n770\n00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.660\nWe just wanna remind you of those.\n\n771\n00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.582\nAgain, it's important to know the process,\nthe steps in order.\n\n772\n00:34:06.582 --> 00:34:10.230\nIf you're gonna plan for the exam,\nbe something for you to think about.\n\n773\n00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.950\nIf you're gonna be doing this for real,\nsome of you may already be doing it for\n\n774\n00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.160\nreal, you obviously know and\nare practiced in those steps.\n\n775\n00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.840\nBut if not,\nit's good to know the methodology so\n\n776\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.910\nwe understand how to act forensically in\na sound manner whenever we interrogate,\n\n777\n00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.285\ninteract with, or try to examine\ndata in any form for any reason.\n\n778\n00:34:27.285 --> 00:34:28.145\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n779\n00:34:28.145 --> 00:34:31.555\nJust because it's a phone,\ndoesn't mean it's also a computer and\n\n780\n00:34:31.555 --> 00:34:33.345\nnow a days that's exactly what they are.\n\n781\n00:34:33.345 --> 00:34:37.205\nThey're basically just small mobile\ncomputers that are connected to networks.\n\n782\n00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:39.362\nAnd if we're going to\ndo computer forensics,\n\n783\n00:34:39.362 --> 00:34:42.925\nwell then that encompasses our\nmobile devices and networks as well.\n\n784\n00:34:42.925 --> 00:34:45.075\nAdam, cool stuff that we saw today,\n\n785\n00:34:45.075 --> 00:34:48.260\nI'm looking at the back of my phone I\nmean I knew the SIM was in there, but\n\n786\n00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.370\na lot of information about mobile networks\nand phone technology, I was not aware of.\n\n787\n00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.980\nI'm sure some of you weren't as well, and\n\n788\n00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.640\nnow we're a little more better\nequipped to work in that environment.\n\n789\n00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.240\nWe thank you for that, Adam.\n\n790\n00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.470\nBut it looks like we've\nexhausted our time for\n\n791\n00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.360\nthis episode,\nas awesome as it may have been.\n\n792\n00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.850\nSo we're gonna need to sign off.\n\n793\n00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.530\nFor ITProTV, thanks for watching.\n\n794\n00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.360\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n795\n00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.583\nI'm a Samsung Galaxy GS7.\n\n796\n00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:12.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n797\n00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:20.160\n[MUSIC]\n\n798\n00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.875\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're\n\n3\n00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.732\nwatching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:13.505\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:16.410\nand welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.320\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more on our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.100\nAnd I'm so glad you joined us today\nbecause in the studio today is our good\n\n9\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.140\nfriend, the tech shaman that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.717\nAdam, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:31.908\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n12\n00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.235\nI was gonna go get my rattle,\nbut you caught me off guard.\n\n13\n00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:34.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n14\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.510\nwe'll do a little shaman related activity.\n\n15\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.615\nA little later on we'll\ndivine some technical data.\n\n16\n00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But before we do that,\n\n17\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.270\nwe have to talk about what it means\nbe an expert, to be a shaman,\n\n18\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.545\nto use the terminology Daniel threw at us.\n\n19\n00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.244\nWhat does is it actually mean\nto be an expert witness and\n\n20\n00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.652\nto write reports that\nare forensically sound and\n\n21\n00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.910\ncan be produced and\nactually used in a court, if necessary?\n\n22\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.140\nOr just for your customer,\n\n23\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.170\nwhether you ever see the light\nof day in a court of law or not?\n\n24\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.250\nIt's important to understand, in our\nactivities, in what we do and how we do\n\n25\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.530\nthem, that as a forensic investigator,\nwe must, as we've often talked about in\n\n26\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.170\nall of the conversations we've had up\nuntil now, follow certain standards,\n\n27\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.300\ncertain requirements, certain processes,\ncertain methodologies.\n\n28\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.710\nBut we always have to have in mind in\nthe back of our head that what we do\n\n29\n00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.000\nis gonna represent us, not just now, but\n\n30\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.280\npotentially at a certain\npoint in a court of law.\n\n31\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.530\nWhether we get there or\nnot is not the point.\n\n32\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.580\nWe have to be prepared to get there if\nwe do, and as a result, act accordingly.\n\n33\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.424\nSo what I thought it would be good to do\nwould be to start out by talking a little\n\n34\n00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:35.500\nbit about what it means\nto be an expert witness.\n\n35\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.220\nYou've heard me refer to\nthis in some other shows.\n\n36\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.560\nI want to talk about the standard\nin the United States,\n\n37\n00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.850\naccording to federal rules of evidence,\nthat you must meet, or\n\n38\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000\nstandards, you must meet to be\nconsidered an expert witness.\n\n39\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.280\nKeep in mind, as we've often talked\nabout in other areas, the fact that we\n\n40\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.900\nare focusing on North America,\nspecifically United States-centric\n\n41\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.190\ndiscussions with regards to things\nlike federal rules of evidence here.\n\n42\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.560\nFor the standard, it's important to note,\n\n43\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.160\nthis may be different in\nyour area of the world.\n\n44\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.050\nBeing an expert witness in,\ntake your pick,\n\n45\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.380\nany country,\nanywhere you want to go today?\n\n46\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.660\nLike American Express says,\nwhere do you want to go today?\n\n47\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.440\n&gt;&gt; Let's go to, how about\nthe lovely coast of South Africa?\n\n48\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.000\n&gt;&gt; So in South Africa, perhaps, whether\nit's in Durban or wherever you may be in\n\n49\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.370\nSouth Africa, the idea may be very similar\nto what it is to be an expert witness, but\n\n50\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.980\nit also might be slightly different.\n\n51\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.520\nAnd the interpretation of that would be\nsomething that an investigator has to be\n\n52\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.270\naware of and is responsible for\n\n53\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.730\nunderstanding based on knowledge\nof the regulatory environment.\n\n54\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.260\nEssentially, the jurisdictional\nlaw that applies in that area\n\n55\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.700\nwould have to be considered.\n\n56\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.182\nSouth Africa would be aligned very closely\nwith United Kingdom's law standards.\n\n57\n00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:42.966\nAnd whatever they may have on\nthe books would, most likely,\n\n58\n00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:45.376\nalmost without exception,\nprobably apply there.\n\n59\n00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:48.042\nThere may be slight variations, but\nit may be a little bit different, so\n\n60\n00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.070\nyou'd want to take note of that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n61\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.990\nSo South Africa it is, my good man.\n\n62\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.634\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll use that as our launching point\n\n63\n00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:54.565\nor jumping off point.\n\n64\n00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:56.933\nWhat is an expert,\nessentially, is what we asked.\n\n65\n00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:00.913\nThe question we want an answer to, an\nexpert witness is somebody who by virtue\n\n66\n00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:05.017\nof education, profession or experience\nis believed to have special knowledge\n\n67\n00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.630\nand/or information about their\nsubject matter that would allow us,\n\n68\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.760\nbeyond that of the average person, to say\nthat they are going to be believable.\n\n69\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.100\nAnd, therefore, we can take their\ntestimony, their information,\n\n70\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.120\ntheir experience into\naccount in a court of law.\n\n71\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.080\nAnd we can rely on their opinion,\nand we can use that\n\n72\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.070\nopinion to help us to understand\nthe facts that may be presented.\n\n73\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.900\nThe opinion of an expert witness\nauthorized by a court has legal status,\n\n74\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.800\naccording to the law, and can be accepted\nas evidence in that court of law.\n\n75\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.670\nNow keep in mind that the judge,\n\n76\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.850\nobviously, at the end of the day has\nthe ultimate decision-making authority.\n\n77\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.726\nThe judge has the ability, in other words,\nto specify that this person,\n\n78\n00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:45.604\nwhoever is being presented,\npotentially, or offered, potentially,\n\n79\n00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:49.686\nas an expert witness may or may not meet\nthe requirements that are necessary.\n\n80\n00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:52.501\nOr even though they may have\non paper met the requirements,\n\n81\n00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:56.162\nthe judge may challenge that assumption,\nthat assertion, and say, yeah,\n\n82\n00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:59.370\nDaniel, on paper you've got all\nthe requirements down here.\n\n83\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.250\nYou've got the multiple years of\nprevious testimony we look for.\n\n84\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.930\nYou've got multiple years\nof published literature, or\n\n85\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.850\nwritings behind you that we can point to.\n\n86\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.290\n&gt;&gt; I edited a Wikipedia page [LAUGH].\n\n87\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.370\n&gt;&gt; You've edited Wikipedia,\nit's very important.\n\n88\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.130\nYou've received payment for\n\n89\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.200\ntestimony offered before,\nso you have a track record.\n\n90\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.260\nBut you know what, we're just not gonna\nallow you to testify as an expert witness\n\n91\n00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.750\nin this particular trial.\n\n92\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.460\nI have an issue or concern.\n\n93\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.210\nThere may be a conflict of interest.\n\n94\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.680\nYou may not be able to speak\nauthoritatively to this information for\n\n95\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.260\na variety of reasons, and\nthe judge may make that ruling.\n\n96\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.840\nNow keep in mind that we can challenge\nthe judge's ruling, we can appeal it,\n\n97\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.620\nin other words.\n\n98\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.200\nBut ultimately, at the end of the day\nwhen this all gets sorted out,\n\n99\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.060\nif the judge's ruling is upheld,\n\n100\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.230\nDaniel's not gonna actually be able\nto testify as an expert witness.\n\n101\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.370\nBut the judge may be barring Daniel's\ntestimony, not based on actually\n\n102\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.730\nmeeting the criteria to be an expert\nwitness, but on something else.\n\n103\n00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.670\nDaniel may have worked on another case\nthat is in direct conflict with this one,\n\n104\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.580\nand as a result there's this\nconflict of interest I talked about.\n\n105\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.310\nSo we have to understand that there\nare minimum qualifications, but\n\n106\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.190\nthen there are exigent circumstances,\nexternal circumstances,\n\n107\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.730\nthat we would have to be aware of.\n\n108\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.330\nSo let's talk about what it means to be\nan expert witness and how you qualify.\n\n109\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.970\nUnder the US Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n110\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.690\nto be presented as an expert witness in a\ncourt of law, you must be able to furnish\n\n111\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.800\nthe following three pieces of information\nor validate the following three things.\n\n112\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.320\nYou would have to provide four years of a\nproven track record of previous testimony.\n\n113\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.540\nThis indicates experience.\n\n114\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.935\nYou'd have to have a body\nof written knowledge,\n\n115\n00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.655\nas we were just talking about,\ngoing back ten years.\n\n116\n00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:36.315\nYou'd have to be able to have shown that\nyou've published information in this field\n\n117\n00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.615\naround the activities that\nyou're speaking about or\n\n118\n00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:40.962\nbeing asked to testify\nover a ten year period.\n\n119\n00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:43.532\nAnd you'd have to be able\nto show proof of that.\n\n120\n00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:46.662\nAnd, no, editing Wikipedia\npages is not part of what we\n\n121\n00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:49.102\nwould be considering to be appropriate,\nin case you're wondering.\n\n122\n00:05:49.102 --> 00:05:50.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not to hear my\nfriends tell it [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:05:50.152 --> 00:05:55.051\n&gt;&gt; No, well, I'm just saying that's not\ngonna meet the bar, as we talk about,\n\n124\n00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:57.921\nfor evidential knowledge,\nit's not gonna be met by that.\n\n125\n00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.021\nAnd previous payment that's been\nreceived while giving testimony.\n\n126\n00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.281\nAgain, you'd have to show\nproof of having done this.\n\n127\n00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:07.161\nIn other words, we're not gonna just let\nyou say, hey, yeah, I can go testify.\n\n128\n00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.091\nI'm not doing anything on Thursday at 2:00\no' clock, let's hook this thing up and\n\n129\n00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:10.711\ngo do this.\n\n130\n00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:12.011\n&gt;&gt; Let's light this candle [LAUGH].\n\n131\n00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, let's get this party started,\nas they say.\n\n132\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.880\nYou're gonna have to have a track record.\n\n133\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.310\nNow, this kinda brings to light an\ninteresting issue, which is if you're not\n\n134\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.419\nin that environment already,\nthen how do you become an expert witness.\n\n135\n00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.732\nIf you haven't testified before, and you\nhave to have four years of testimony in\n\n136\n00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.980\norder to overcome that hurdle,\nhow do you ever become an expert witness?\n\n137\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.792\nDo we just manufacture them out\nof the blue, how does that work?\n\n138\n00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:34.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.128\nSo obviously the judge has\nleeway to be able to say, look,\n\n140\n00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:42.710\nyou're the acknowledged expert\nworldwide on this particular issue.\n\n141\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.680\nYou've been writing on it for 30 years.\n\n142\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.447\nYou may never have testified before, but\n\n143\n00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:49.130\nwe're gonna let you be called\ninto court as an expert witness\n\n144\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.130\nbecause nobody knows more about this than\nyou do, according to all the stuff you do.\n\n145\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.640\nSo there are reasons and areas and\nexceptions made all the time.\n\n146\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.620\nIt's not that you have to\nnecessarily have testified for\n\n147\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.750\nfour years running to be considered\nan expert witness exclusively.\n\n148\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.140\nBut the Federal Rules of Evidence do\nstipulate the fact that that is normally\n\n149\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.490\none of the things that we look for.\n\n150\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.450\nRemember, the judge does have the ability\nto specify that you're an acknowledged\n\n151\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.660\nexpert based on writing, based on\nactual doing, based on experience.\n\n152\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.480\nAnd we can then accept you as a result.\n\n153\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.230\nSo it's gonna be a combination of\nthose things, just so you know.\n\n154\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.030\nWe classify witnesses as either technical\nwitnesses or expert witnesses, by the way.\n\n155\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.251\nAnd you may have done technical\nwitness testimony for\n\n156\n00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:32.921\na number of years before\nyou become an expert.\n\n157\n00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:34.860\nThat's another way you often get fed in.\n\n158\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.170\nIt's like a farm system, right?\n\n159\n00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.365\nYou start out at the bottom [LAUGH],\nand you work your way up.\n\n160\n00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:40.694\nYou're a junior expert until we call you.\n\n161\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:45.758\nSo the technical witness is often\nthe one that is gonna do the work,\n\n162\n00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:50.190\ndo the examination,\ndo the analysis, gather the facts,\n\n163\n00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.295\npresent and summarize the findings.\n\n164\n00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:56.987\nThe expert witness is kinda the master.\n\n165\n00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:57.535\nOf all that.\n\n166\n00:07:57.535 --> 00:07:59.567\nSo they're the ones that\noversee all that and\n\n167\n00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:01.920\nthey're the ones that\nwill often go testify.\n\n168\n00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.800\nBut technical witnesses are often called\nto speak to the veracity of a claim about\n\n169\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.190\nevidence and/or to speak to the fact\nthat this particular process or\n\n170\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.280\nthis procedure was done a certain way.\n\n171\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.150\nSo you may spend a long time\nas a technical witness and\n\n172\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.270\neventually graduate up to become\nan expert witness over time.\n\n173\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.740\nIt really just depends\non how this is done.\n\n174\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.970\nSo there's a lot of different\nways to potentially do this.\n\n175\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.040\nBut according to the federal rules of\nevidence, we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n176\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.970\nWe also wanna know about something\ncalled the Daubert Standard.\n\n177\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.515\nThe Daubert Standard D-A-U-B-E-R-T.\n\n178\n00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:38.035\nDaubert, the Doubert standard, excuse me,\nis what is used by a trial judge.\n\n179\n00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:41.705\nIt allows them to make a preliminary\nassessment of whether the expert's\n\n180\n00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:45.370\ntestimony is based on methodology\nthat's scientifically valid.\n\n181\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.619\nCan we take a look at my machine here for\na minute?\n\n182\n00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:50.457\nAnd what you'll see here\nup on the screen is just a,\n\n183\n00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:54.615\nessentially Wikipedia page right,\nthat explains the Daubert Standard,\n\n184\n00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:57.983\na little bit,\nit's from the legal information institute.\n\n185\n00:08:57.983 --> 00:09:00.053\nYou can find information\nabout this all over the web.\n\n186\n00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:00.971\n&gt;&gt; I edited it.\n\n187\n00:09:00.971 --> 00:09:05.211\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and Daniel, proudly, is the editor\nof this, which is why around here,\n\n188\n00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.057\nofficially, we refer to\nhim as the Daubert expert.\n\n189\n00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:08.955\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n190\n00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:10.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or the expert Daubert,\n\n191\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.510\ndepending on how you view that.\n\n192\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.420\nBut this is just a standard\nthat is used in trial law to,\n\n193\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.150\nfrom a judges perspective, weigh\nthe ability of the expert witness to speak\n\n194\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.780\nto this information and\nbe considered an expert.\n\n195\n00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.371\nSo you wanna be aware of the fact\nthat we call it out here.\n\n196\n00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:28.690\nWe examine the testimony they are using,\nwhether it's scientifically valid.\n\n197\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.890\nUnder the standard it says, factors that\ncould be considered in determining what\n\n198\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.950\nthe methodology valid are as follows.\n\n199\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.815\nYou'll see there are five here.\n\n200\n00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:39.650\nWhether the theory or technique in\nquestion has been or can be tested.\n\n201\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.563\nSo can we show what we did\nis scientifically valid?\n\n202\n00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.825\nWhether it has been subjected\nto peer review and publication?\n\n203\n00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:50.892\nHas more than one person in this industry\nwith knowledge of this looked at and\n\n204\n00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:54.784\nembedded and said yeah this\nparticular process is sound.\n\n205\n00:09:54.784 --> 00:09:57.395\nAnd here's why, or\nwe don't have a clue what you're doing and\n\n206\n00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:00.664\nnobody's ever seen that before and\nwe don't really understand what you did.\n\n207\n00:10:00.664 --> 00:10:02.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And have any knowledge of that.\n\n208\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.720\nIts known or potential error rate,\nin other words, what do we know about it?\n\n209\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.570\nHow often is it right?\n\n210\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.070\nHow often is it wrong?\n\n211\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.760\nSo for instance, things like DNA testing\nare measured under the Daubert standard,\n\n212\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.450\nor have been historically.\n\n213\n00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.140\nBecause at some point, DNA testing\nwas a new concept scientifically.\n\n214\n00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.110\nAnd nobody really understood,\nwhen you got a DNA sample and\n\n215\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.480\nyou figured out what the DNA sequencing\nwas, how often you got it right or wrong.\n\n216\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.400\nThey had to do that.\n\n217\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.050\nHundreds, thousands of times.\n\n218\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.380\nPeer review it, examine it to really\nunderstand whether or not they were\n\n219\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.724\ngetting information that would be\nseen as being scientifically valid.\n\n220\n00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:37.763\nOr whether we're getting random garbage\nthat may not actually represent who was on\n\n221\n00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:40.315\nthe other end of a DNA\nsample legitimately, right?\n\n222\n00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:41.695\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n223\n00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:45.845\nAnd then, the existence and maintenance\nof standards controlling its operations.\n\n224\n00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:50.645\nDo we have a methodology scientifically\nproven, validated, documented, etc and\n\n225\n00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:53.925\nwhether it has attracted widespread\nacceptance within the relative,\n\n226\n00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:55.975\nthe relevant scientific community.\n\n227\n00:10:55.975 --> 00:10:59.825\nThis comes from a case called Daubert\nversus Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals.\n\n228\n00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.390\nYou can see the reference to it here.\n\n229\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.381\nThis is where the Daubert\nstandard came from and\n\n230\n00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:09.240\nis used in the Federal as well as State\nCourts in the United States to represent\n\n231\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.706\nwhat it means to have\nscientifically valid evidence.\n\n232\n00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:17.335\nAnd an expert witness that can speak to\nthat scientifically valid methodology that\n\n233\n00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:19.070\ngathered that evidence.\n\n234\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.822\nAnd this is the burden of proof we have to\nmeet in order to be able to stipulate that\n\n235\n00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:25.512\nsomething does indeed have\nscientific merit and value.\n\n236\n00:11:25.512 --> 00:11:28.233\nAnd as a result could be considered\nevidence that is admissible in\n\n237\n00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:29.190\na court of law.\n\n238\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.282\nWe call it the Daubert standard, so you do\nwant to make sure you are aware of that.\n\n239\n00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:34.434\nA trial itself,\nwhen we go through a trial,\n\n240\n00:11:34.434 --> 00:11:38.451\nactually follows some pretty prescribed\nsequence of events and methodology, so\n\n241\n00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.790\nwe call it the order of a trial.\n\n242\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.480\nI just wanna speak about that momentarily,\n\n243\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.170\nexplain that to you before we\ntalk about and take a look at,\n\n244\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.710\nwhich is actually kinda interesting,\nwhat a potential report looks like.\n\n245\n00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.972\nWhat does an expert witness produce\nwhen they actually are gonna testify?\n\n246\n00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:56.068\nWell, they typically submit a report\nthat is used as the basis of you getting\n\n247\n00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.415\nready to go to trial.\n\n248\n00:11:57.415 --> 00:12:00.789\nThis evidentiary findings that\nthe examination produced.\n\n249\n00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:03.425\nAnd we're going to take a look at\nwhat a sample report may look like.\n\n250\n00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:04.745\nYou know kinda debunk it,\njust walk through it.\n\n251\n00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.262\nTake a look at some of the facts in there.\n\n252\n00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:07.812\nBut first the order of the trial.\n\n253\n00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:11.752\nSo motions that often takes place in\nthe beginning, pre-trial motions.\n\n254\n00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:13.682\nHey we wanna get this evidence excluded.\n\n255\n00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:15.247\nHey we think this is an issue.\n\n256\n00:12:15.247 --> 00:12:16.626\nHey we want this person here.\n\n257\n00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:19.760\nYou know the lawyers, the defense and\nthe prosecutor get together,\n\n258\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.336\nthey put all this stuff together.\n\n259\n00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:24.367\nThe judge has to go through and\nlisten to all this and figure it out.\n\n260\n00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:27.995\nSo that by the time they get to trial all\nthis has been established and ruled on and\n\n261\n00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:31.906\nwe're not worried about dealing with\nall the objections that come from that.\n\n262\n00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:33.476\nWe have opening statements, defense and\n\n263\n00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:35.466\nprosecution both get to get up and\nmake a statement.\n\n264\n00:12:35.466 --> 00:12:39.670\nYou've probably seen this in TV shows,\nmovies, whatever the case may be.\n\n265\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.840\nPresentation of the case,\ncross-examination or rebuttal.\n\n266\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.260\nAll that takes place that's kind of meat,\nthe middle part of the trial itself.\n\n267\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.530\nThat's what we often referred\nto when we say we're in trial.\n\n268\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.990\nReally talking about presentation in\nthe case, cross-examination, rebuttal.\n\n269\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.205\nAnd then jury orders are given,\nso the judge will in some case,\n\n270\n00:12:57.205 --> 00:12:58.669\ndepends on the kinda trial.\n\n271\n00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:00.420\nYou don't always have a jury trial.\n\n272\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.701\nYou may have a trial in front\nof a judge without a jury.\n\n273\n00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:05.710\nSo there may not be jury\norders in every trial.\n\n274\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.430\nJust be aware of that.\n\n275\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.920\nBut most trials are gonna be jury trials.\n\n276\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.150\nCivil trials are always\ngonna be jury trials.\n\n277\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.950\nAnd as a result of that, or\nthey're mostly jury trials, I should say.\n\n278\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.540\nThey're not always, but\nmore often than not they're jury trials.\n\n279\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.600\nAnd so jury orders are given to, the jury\nmeaning the judge, will explain to\n\n280\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.630\nthe jury what they are supposed to\nconsider, what they should be able to do.\n\n281\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.640\nNot how they're going to rule, but\n\n282\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.950\nessentially how they're gonna decide\nthe facts of the case, rather.\n\n283\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.210\nBut in some cases, they may have heard\ntestimony that will be excluded, and so\n\n284\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.240\nas a result the judge will remind them of\nthe fact that they have to ignore that\n\n285\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.220\ntestimony.\n\n286\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.830\nThey may have heard or seen evidence\nthat they may wanna hear or see again.\n\n287\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.690\nSo the judge will explain to\nthem what the process is,\n\n288\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.352\nto request that that evidence be\nbrought back into the jury room.\n\n289\n00:13:49.352 --> 00:13:53.760\nThey may be able to interpret the findings\nof the case in a certain way and\n\n290\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.760\nreach one of several conclusions.\n\n291\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.840\nMeaning, they could decide on life\nimprisonment versus a death sentence.\n\n292\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.730\nAnd so they may have to be told what the\nrequirements of burden of proof will be.\n\n293\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.500\nIn order to be able to rule on\nsomebody getting a death sentence.\n\n294\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.540\nTypically, it has to be\na unanimous verdict,\n\n295\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.490\nmeaning everybody in the jury pool has\nto agree that this is the way they go.\n\n296\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.430\nIf there's even one person who's\nholding out, they may not be able to\n\n297\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.260\nimpose a death sentence, but\nrather go with life imprisonment.\n\n298\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.874\nSo jury orders are gonna be given\naround these kind of things.\n\n299\n00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:24.440\nAnd sentencing guidelines will\nbe sometimes part of that.\n\n300\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.587\nAnd then, closing arguments will be given.\n\n301\n00:14:26.587 --> 00:14:29.530\nAt the end of this,\nright before the Jury actually goes in.\n\n302\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.160\nAnd says okay, hey, let's go spend 12\nhours locked in room somewhere and\n\n303\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.170\ntalk about what we heard and\nfigure out what the outcome's gonna be.\n\n304\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.379\nEach side again the prosecution and\ndefense,\n\n305\n00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.607\nget's to give closing arguments\nwhere they summarize the facts and\n\n306\n00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:46.304\ntry to make the best case for their\nparticular presentation of the evidence.\n\n307\n00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:49.018\nTo try to say that I'm the right\nperson who's arguing this case for\n\n308\n00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:51.190\nthe right reasons and\nyou should believe me.\n\n309\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.070\nNo, you should believe me.\n\n310\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.800\nNo, you should believe me.\n\n311\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.645\nAnd that's kinda how we go.\n\n312\n00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:56.430\nSo, you just wanna make sure you're\naware of the order of a trial.\n\n313\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.524\nThese five steps are gonna be important\nfor you to consider and, again,\n\n314\n00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:03.290\nto be knowledgeable in case you're ever\nasked about them, would be a good idea.\n\n315\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.810\nIf we can go back to my machine,\n\n316\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.853\nwe're gonna take a look at what it means\nto actually put together a formal report.\n\n317\n00:15:08.853 --> 00:15:12.209\nWhat is an example of an expert witnesses\nreport, if we can go to full screen just\n\n318\n00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:14.430\ntake a look at this,\nwanna show you this real quick.\n\n319\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.673\nYou'll see here that, this is gonna be\nan example of a Expert Witness Digital\n\n320\n00:15:19.673 --> 00:15:24.041\nforensics Report, went out and\njust found a copy of one online.\n\n321\n00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:29.259\nSo you'll see here as we scroll down\nthat this is, whoops, there we go.\n\n322\n00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:33.294\nThis is going to allow us to see\nwho the investigator is or was,\n\n323\n00:15:33.294 --> 00:15:38.186\ndigital forensics examiner,\nwho the examiner was, their information,\n\n324\n00:15:38.186 --> 00:15:43.174\ntheir credentials, where they're located,\nthe subject, the offense.\n\n325\n00:15:43.174 --> 00:15:47.800\nSo what is the person that was being\nessentially investigated accused of.\n\n326\n00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.620\nLooks like Money Laundering, Embezzlement,\nInsider Trading, Scamming, Racketeering,\n\n327\n00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.439\nFraud, Terrorism, and Forgery.\n\n328\n00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:55.961\nCuz it's never good without terrorism.\n\n329\n00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:57.194\nYou always gotta throw that one in there.\n\n330\n00:15:57.194 --> 00:15:58.145\n&gt;&gt; Stick up man.\n\n331\n00:15:58.145 --> 00:15:58.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n332\n00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:01.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apparently this person was pretty busy.\n\n333\n00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:04.130\nSo what's the name of\nthe accused you'll see here.\n\n334\n00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.079\nThe date of the request,\nthe date of conclusion.\n\n335\n00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:09.340\nSo when were they requested to make\nthe investigation, how long did it take?\n\n336\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.690\nYou can see all that there.\n\n337\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.250\nWhat's actually here,\na little table of contents more or\n\n338\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.875\nless tells you what we're gonna see so\nyou can get your staff to go through that.\n\n339\n00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:21.175\nThen we go in do a little summary\non the background of the case so\n\n340\n00:16:21.175 --> 00:16:24.685\nwe can look at almost like\nan executive summary there\n\n341\n00:16:24.685 --> 00:16:28.395\ntells us what kinda tools were used,\nforensic toolkit imager software,\n\n342\n00:16:28.395 --> 00:16:33.530\nit's called FTK Imagur to get\ninformation from a thumb drive\n\n343\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.360\nthat was said to be in the possession of\nthe accused, based on their information.\n\n344\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.318\nThere was some digital evidence for\nremnant data that was there so\n\n345\n00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:43.705\nthey're gonna talk about\nhow they collected that.\n\n346\n00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:46.145\nSo obviously we'll take\na look at what they said.\n\n347\n00:16:46.145 --> 00:16:48.715\nQuestions asked relevant to the case.\n\n348\n00:16:48.715 --> 00:16:50.405\nSo what questions, essentially,\n\n349\n00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:53.215\ndid they have to answer as\npart of the investigation.\n\n350\n00:16:53.215 --> 00:16:54.745\nIs the computer system, thumb drive,\n\n351\n00:16:54.745 --> 00:16:58.485\nor other personal devices assigned\nto Branshaw by the company?\n\n352\n00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.795\nSo, is this set of\ndevices they're examining\n\n353\n00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:04.665\nactually the set of devices that\nwould have been given to the accused?\n\n354\n00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:06.770\nAnd if so, how did they validate that?\n\n355\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.400\nDoes anyone else in or out of the company\nhave access to these devices?\n\n356\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.650\nSo could they have planted\nthis information and\n\n357\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.600\nmade it look like this accused\nperson was up to no good?\n\n358\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.740\nAnd if so how do we validate that because\nyou know this person may be innocent we\n\n359\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.590\njust don't know.\n\n360\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.549\nRemember we assume that somebody is\ninnocent until proven guilty, but\n\n361\n00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:25.776\nthat doesn't mean that we can rule out\nthe possibility that they are guilty.\n\n362\n00:17:25.776 --> 00:17:28.153\nIt means we have to give them the benefit\nof the doubt until we prove that they\n\n363\n00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:30.516\nare or are not, at least that's how\nit's supposed to work anyway [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.249\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n365\n00:17:31.249 --> 00:17:35.088\n&gt;&gt; And if these devices were assigned by\nthe company, were they being used before,\n\n366\n00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:37.750\nduring or shortly after they\nwere given to the accused?\n\n367\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.810\nIn other words, could there have\nbeen remnant data on the device\n\n368\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.080\nleftover from a prior user that was\nthere but we had no knowledge of and\n\n369\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.720\nthe accused had no knowledge of?\n\n370\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.960\nAnd as a result may have been there all\nalong and because we didn't sanitize\n\n371\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.485\nthe device that has actually going to\npoint to somebody else, not the accused.\n\n372\n00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:56.856\nAnd that's something else to consider.\n\n373\n00:17:56.856 --> 00:17:59.230\nSo logical questions to ask.\n\n374\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.960\nHow do we do search and seizure?\n\n375\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.160\nWe have to specify what was done.\n\n376\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.110\nWe've talked a lot about the fact\nwe have to document these things.\n\n377\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.480\nYou'll see a list of the unique exhibits\nand the explanations of what they are,\n\n378\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.050\nserial numbers, unique identifiers\napplied for each device here.\n\n379\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:20.480\nSo we have cell phones, we have laptops,\nwe have a variety of different things.\n\n380\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.020\nAnd every one of them has a unique\nidentifier that can be attributed to\n\n381\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.340\nthe device so we know how to track them.\n\n382\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.290\nSo that's been documented here.\n\n383\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.470\nSome further questions asked about\nrelevancy for certain things.\n\n384\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.700\nWe would go through that.\n\n385\n00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.240\nSo evidence that's gonna be searched.\n\n386\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.710\nWe kinda specify what's gonna be there, we\nhave laptop, cell phone, things like that.\n\n387\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.680\nThose are all listed.\n\n388\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.590\nThe offenses that are being propagated or\nput forward for the accused.\n\n389\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.380\nAnd so we'd have a list of those.\n\n390\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.090\nDeleted files of evidentiary\nvalue to the case.\n\n391\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.360\nSo what was found again noticed, each one\nis uniquely identified and discussed.\n\n392\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.570\nThree folders containing files of\nprobative interests were found.\n\n393\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.951\nThey were on the thumb drive\nwith this serial number, so\n\n394\n00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:04.689\neverything is uniquely tracked back and\nkind of aligned with and\n\n395\n00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:06.940\nassociated with the evidence\nwhere we find it.\n\n396\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.680\nThese documents contained, we kinda\ntalked about what's there, encrypted and\n\n397\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.770\nstuck in a graphic files, stolen credit\ncard information, check details,\n\n398\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.380\nlottery information.\n\n399\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.220\nThey have the trifecta going on there.\n\n400\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.310\n&gt;&gt; They're going buck wild.\n\n401\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.840\n&gt;&gt; And then from the documents acquired,\n\n402\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.100\nthese files contain bank account\ndetails of the person in question.\n\n403\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.060\nFive notepad files disguised by\nsteganographic techniques were uncovered\n\n404\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.320\napparently.\n\n405\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.120\nThere was encrypted data in them.\n\n406\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.320\nThere were Excel documents\nthat were recovered.\n\n407\n00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.610\nSo there's some information there.\n\n408\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.890\nMicrosoft Word documents were recovered,\n\n409\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.689\n25 photos were recovered, some of which\nwere steganographically modified.\n\n410\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.770\nOne access database was found with\na bunch of account information in it.\n\n411\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.150\nSo we talk about some of that.\n\n412\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.160\nExamination details are listed here.\n\n413\n00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.170\nSo they go through, they talk about\nthe hash values that were created for\n\n414\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.030\nevery file.\n\n415\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.193\nBoth MP5 and one, we've been though,\n\n416\n00:20:03.193 --> 00:20:06.890\nwe talked about those Seeing how those\nare going to be generated with hash\n\n417\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.670\nwhatever the case may be,\nwhatever tool you use.\n\n418\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.910\nSo we have unique values that\nwere associated there, deleted,\n\n419\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.760\nencrypted in stenographic files.\n\n420\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.140\n40 some odd files apparently were found,\nso\n\n421\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.030\nwe're gonna list them, interact with them,\ntalk about what they are,\n\n422\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.070\nfile types, things that may have\nbeen of interest to us there.\n\n423\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.300\nThere's information there,\nlooks like we have some screen captures\n\n424\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.980\nshowing what was found,\nso highlighting that.\n\n425\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.270\nNot uncommon to put some screen captures\nand pictures into a report to illustrate\n\n426\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.010\nfor whoever's gonna read it more or less\nwhat we're talking about, where they were.\n\n427\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.980\nObviously the specificity of\nthe data is contained elsewhere.\n\n428\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.970\nThis is really just a high-level summary.\n\n429\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.760\nBut you would see that there.\n\n430\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.320\nThere's some samples\nof zip files whatever.\n\n431\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.650\nSo you've got some screen captures,\nand then analysis results.\n\n432\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.160\nWhat did we find essentially?\n\n433\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.210\nAgain, this is a really high\nlevel executive summary report.\n\n434\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.490\nThis is not the detailed 200 page\nmonster that may have all of the facts.\n\n435\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.510\nThis is probably a summary that\nwas given to a customer and\n\n436\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.700\nmay have been presented to\na lawyer to prepare and\n\n437\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.480\nbrief to start setting up a case\nthat they were going to prosecute.\n\n438\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.910\nYou'd have to do depositions to follow\nup to get more detailed information.\n\n439\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.040\nThis is almost like a high level\noutline that a lawyer would use\n\n440\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.420\nto drive the deposition, and say okay Mr.\nDaniel if you were the exhibitor, or\n\n441\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.810\nrather the investigator, let's go through\neach of these files what you found.\n\n442\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.440\nI'm gonna go based on what you have\nin the executive summary here.\n\n443\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.470\nTell me more about this, and\nthey would walk through it with you.\n\n444\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.110\nSo this is not necessarily\na detailed report.\n\n445\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.110\nBut it is, obviously,\nstill hitting all the key facts, and\n\n446\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.220\nproviding summaries of information that's\ngonna be very valuable to us, right?\n\n447\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.400\nSo we do wanna know that, so\ncellphones confiscated for\n\n448\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.030\nanalysis were, what did we actually find,\nhere is the information about them.\n\n449\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.965\nWhat are the conclusions, what were\nthe information on the general findings,\n\n450\n00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:55.140\nthere's some exhibits and\nthings like that.\n\n451\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.540\nSo when we go through and\nlook at a report like this,\n\n452\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.270\nwe're looking at just one vision of\npotentially what the world may look like,\n\n453\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.710\nbut remember,\nwe still have to hit the highlights and\n\n454\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.700\nprovide basic conceptual information\nabout what we did and how we did it.\n\n455\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.060\nAnd that is represented\nin a report like this.\n\n456\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.760\nSo it's just something for us to at least\nhave in our mind as an investigator.\n\n457\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.580\nThere are templates for this, by the way.\n\n458\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.590\nWe could go out and find templates online.\n\n459\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.780\nIt's not as if you got to\nmake this up from scratch.\n\n460\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.950\nThere's an accepted way for\nyou to do this.\n\n461\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.110\nA lot of the tools that we will use and\nsome of them that we've demonstrated for\n\n462\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.530\nyou are gonna have templates that will\nbe used to spit out reports, right?\n\n463\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.730\nSo when you look at incase, or\nthe forensic toolkit, or things like that,\n\n464\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.400\nwhen you get done gathering up all your\ninformation entering it all into the tool,\n\n465\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.230\nyou hit a button and a report pops-out and\nthat report is gonna\n\n466\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.825\nformatting essentially gonna provide\nyou with all the details you need.\n\n467\n00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:47.770\nWe've demonstrated some of that in prior\nepisodes, encourage you to go back and\n\n468\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.110\ntake a look of those and\nsee as produce that kinda end to end.\n\n469\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.140\nAnd see how that works, pretty interesting\nstuff when you get into it and\n\n470\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.390\nwould encourage you to think about looking\nat those episodes on Windows forensics,\n\n471\n00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.890\nand hard drive forensics,\nsome of the other stuff that we've done\n\n472\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.500\nthat helps you to understand how to\nput this kind of a report together.\n\n473\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.230\n&gt;&gt; People love to see those lovely\ngenerated reports that these tools\n\n474\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.110\nspit out for us.\n\n475\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n476\n00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.140\nWe love them too, right,\n\n477\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.410\nbecause it keeps us from having\nto try to figure out some form.\n\n478\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.610\nWhy are we invent the wheel,\nthey already got it built in.\n\n479\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.080\nUse that, it's a great format,\nevery one is easily read, and\n\n480\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.310\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n481\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.770\nUltimately at the end of the day, you just\nwant to keep as much detail as possible,\n\n482\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.040\nbe as specific as possible, and\nknow your audience as well.\n\n483\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.110\nIf they're not a bunch of technical people\nyou probably don't wanna throw a bunch of\n\n484\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.140\ntechnical jargon out.\n\n485\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.820\nJust give them what they need to know\nin a way that they can understand it.\n\n486\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.460\nThat's very helpful for\nthe people that aren't technically minded.\n\n487\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.900\nAnd then if you need to go deeper, you can\ncreate a report that's that way as well.\n\n488\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.951\nAnd then of course,\nworking as an expert witness,\n\n489\n00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:43.393\nwe saw that earlier in the episode.\n\n490\n00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:46.613\nWhat qualifies us as an expert witness and\n\n491\n00:23:46.613 --> 00:23:52.410\nwhat duties might we be expected to\nperform as such as an expert witness.\n\n492\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.506\nAnd Adam you've done a masterful job,\nan expert witness to turn a phrase.\n\n493\n00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:57.366\n&gt;&gt; A shaman like job.\n\n494\n00:23:57.366 --> 00:24:00.812\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the man is like\nwhat you call them, a witch doctor.\n\n495\n00:24:00.812 --> 00:24:01.346\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n496\n00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:05.205\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to doing this stuff and\nwe appreciate his time, coming here and\n\n497\n00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:09.360\nimparting that knowledge to us so that\nwe can one day do CHFI work ourselves.\n\n498\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.550\nThat being said, Adam, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n499\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.660\nAnd we do thank our audience for watching,\nhopefully you've enjoyed this very much.\n\n500\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.540\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n501\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.645\n&gt;&gt; That's the shaman salute.\n\n502\n00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:22.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n503\n00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:30.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n504\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.340\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO TV.\n\n",
