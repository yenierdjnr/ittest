Absolutely, so we have 14\nknowledge areas in CHFI version 9.\n\n6\n00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.059\nA little bit condensed down from\nwhat version 8 would have been.\n\n7\n00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.275\nWe had 22, 21, 22 in version 8 so\nit condensed them down a little bit.\n\n8\n00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.225\nThings like, what is the role of\ncomputer forensics in today's world?\n\n9\n00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:32.725\nHow do we become an investigator?\n\n10\n00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.135\nWhat are the methodologies, the rules,\n\n11\n00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.510\nthe laws, jurisdictions we\nhave to be concerned with?\n\n12\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.480\nWhat's the investigative process?\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.050\nUnderstanding hard disks and\nfile systems, always a big one,\n\n14\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.860\nalways very important to know about that.\n\n15\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.540\nOperating system forensics,\nnetwork forensics, web forensics,\n\n16\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.010\nthe investigation of mobile platforms,\nlooking at cloud and\n\n17\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.120\nvirtualization, malware and\ninvestigative reporting.\n\n18\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.920\nHow do we produce our results and\ndo so in a forensically sound and\n\n19\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.990\nlaw abiding manner so\nwe can provide evidence in a court of law,\n\n20\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.900\nif required, are all areas and\nactivities that we would look at.\n\n21\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.310\nAnd least not, let's not forget\ndatabase forensics as well because\n\n22\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830\nwe do talk about database forensics.\n\n23\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.620\nBut all those areas are part\nof what we'll be covering in\n\n24\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.240\nthe CHFI conversations to come.\n\n25\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n26\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.390\nAdam, could you tell us\nalso a little bit about\n\n27\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.700\nwho the intended audience would be for\nthis exam?\n\n28\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n29\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.380\nAnybody who is interested\neither in becoming more\n\n30\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950\nknowledgeable about forensics,\nthis would be a great way\n\n31\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.910\nto learn more about what you would\ndo as a forensic investigator.\n\n32\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.590\nSomebody who may already be certified as a\nCHFI in a prior version looking to upgrade\n\n33\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.810\ntheir skills would be a very logical\ncandidate for this kind of knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020\nAny IT professional looking to\nunderstand more about security and\n\n35\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130\nmethodologies associated within\nits response in forensics\n\n36\n00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.270\nwould also benefit from this discussion.\n\n37\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.800\nAnd anybody who may, for instance,\nhave gone through perhaps CEH or any of\n\n38\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.830\nthe other EC counsel related training or\nis looking to deepen and broaden their\n\n39\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.505\nknowledge around security would find this\nmaterial to be of great benefit to them.\n\n40\n00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nAnything you can tell us about\n\n41\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.790\nthe exam itself?\n\n42\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.230\nThis is a certification-driven\nseries that we're doing.\n\n43\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.830\nAny help on that would be great.\n\n44\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.720\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nobviously we can't talk about everything.\n\n45\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.180\nBut like EC Council exams and all vendor\nexams, there is a process you go through.\n\n46\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.765\nI encourage you to go to the EC Council\nwebsite, read up on the specificity of\n\n47\n00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:19.235\nhow to make sure you're compliant with\ntheir requirements to take their exam.\n\n48\n00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:22.041\nYou usually have to go through\na process and send in an application,\n\n49\n00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.775\nfill out some forms, things like that.\n\n50\n00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.880\nSo I encourage you to go out to\neccouncil.org, take a look there.\n\n51\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.360\n&gt;&gt; The exam has a certain number\nof questions associated with it,\n\n52\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.680\ntends to be multiple choice driven,\ntime bounded.\n\n53\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.762\nSo standard discussion about those kind of\nrequirements would be what we talk about.\n\n54\n00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:37.920\nBut I encourage you to go\nto the vendor website,\n\n55\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.010\nread up on the latest requirements on\nthe information as from time to time\n\n56\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.060\nthose things may change at\nthe whim of the vendor.\n\n57\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.920\nAnd obviously, as a result,\n\n58\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.480\nwant you to always have the most\nrecent information available to you.\n\n59\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, excellent stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.430\nAnd if that sounds like something that\nmight be interesting to you, well,\n\n61\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.980\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in the upcoming series.\n\n",

00:00:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're going with.\n\n17\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Now with more versioning.\n\n18\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050\n&gt;&gt; Now with more versioning,\nthan we have with version 8.\n\n19\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.150\nSo glad to be back.\n\n20\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.910\nGlad to be spending time\nwith you as always.\n\n21\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.530\nWe're gonna start talking about CHFI.\n\n22\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.540\nVery exciting area of knowledge and\ncontent.\n\n23\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.630\nHopefully you'll find it to be so,\nComputer Hacking Forensics Investigation.\n\n24\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.458\nGenerically computer forensics, you hear\nit often referred to as digital forensics.\n\n25\n00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.890\nWhat we're gonna be spending time\non talking about working with and\n\n26\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.760\nthinking through,\nis the logic of how we do\n\n27\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.440\ninvestigations on computer related crimes,\ncrimes that involve computers.\n\n28\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.117\nHacking incidence for instance,\npeople that who have used computers to\n\n29\n00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:10.658\nachieve some nefarious,\nand whatever it may be.\n\n30\n00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.462\nAnd the methodological procedures and\ntechniques that help us to identify,\n\n31\n00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:18.793\ngather, preserve, extract, interpret,\ndocument and ultimately examine evidence\n\n32\n00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:22.948\nfrom multiple perspectives is really what\ncomputer forensics will be all about, or\n\n33\n00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.460\nwhat we will focus on.\n\n34\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.020\nAnd most importantly in ways\nthat are legally admissible.\n\n35\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.390\nIt's not just enough to say hey,\n\n36\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.930\nby the way we wanna go out,\nwe wanna gather evidence.\n\n37\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.850\nCuz we could certainly do that.\n\n38\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.380\nBut if we do it in a way that is not\nperceived in a court of law according\n\n39\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.390\nto the rules of evidence to be legitimate,\nand therefore allowable, admissible.\n\n40\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.960\nIt's the term that we will use.\n\n41\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.080\nThen whatever we have done,\nthe activities will engaged in and\n\n42\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.180\nthe fruits of that labor will enforce\nshould be read or null and void.\n\n43\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.162\nWe will not in other words,\nhave access to the information.\n\n44\n00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:56.735\nWe'll not be able to leverage in use that\ninformation in order to further prosecute\n\n45\n00:01:56.735 --> 00:02:00.584\nor to pursue any leads that come from\nthat, or to pursue a case in a court\n\n46\n00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:04.833\nof law, and potentially bring somebody\nbefore the court seeking justice for\n\n47\n00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.040\nwrongs they may have committed.\n\n48\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.920\nAnd you see this on TV, you see this in\nmovies all the time, as part of a story\n\n49\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.380\nline where somebody does somethings,\nthere is then an investigation.\n\n50\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.910\nAnd if a rule, whatever the rule may be,\n\n51\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.420\nwhatever the story line is,\nperhaps it's not followed correctly.\n\n52\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.630\nMaybe the law enforcement, people legal\nagents were acting on behalf of them.\n\n53\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.760\nWhatever the case was,\ndid not get a search warrant, or\n\n54\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.680\ndid get a search warrant, but\nexceeded the scope, the boundary,\n\n55\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.240\nand the coverage of the search warrant.\n\n56\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.960\nOr maybe because of extenuating\ncircumstances, they went ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.560\nengaged in certain activities.\n\n58\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.860\nAnd then had to validate before\na judge that those activities and\n\n59\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.780\nthe things they did were warranted.\n\n60\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.870\nWere allowed because of extenuating or\nwhat we call exigent circumstances.\n\n61\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.140\nAll these variations.\n\n62\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.138\n&gt;&gt; Adam,\nI've watched plenty of gritty cop dramas.\n\n63\n00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.200\nAnd I'll know,is all you have to do\nis say I heard someone yell for help.\n\n64\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.135\nAnd then you can go and\ndo whatever you want.\n\n65\n00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.227\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you can do that,\n\n66\n00:02:58.227 --> 00:02:59.150\nthat is very true.\n\n67\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.890\nBut doing whatever you want,\nall kidding aside, we're joking, but\n\n68\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.900\nraises a really interesting\npoint under the thought process,\n\n69\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.760\naround the thought process\nas we interpret this.\n\n70\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.050\nThe idea is that yes,\nwhat we just described,\n\n71\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.190\nwhat we call exigent circumstance, right?\n\n72\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.890\nSituational things that are happening\nthat normally we would say,\n\n73\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.020\nhey you are not allowed to go\nbreak open that door, right?\n\n74\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.135\nBut somebody yelling, help,\nI'm being held hostage, help,\n\n75\n00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.740\nsomeone's got a gun to my head,\nwhatever they yell.\n\n76\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.264\nOr you believe as a law enforcement\nofficer that somebody is about\n\n77\n00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:33.060\nto either have bodily harm done to them or\n\n78\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.601\nsomething someone will be harmed\nirreparably if you don't act.\n\n79\n00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.081\nYou have a little room,\n\n80\n00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:43.500\nright, under the interpretation\nin law to be able to take action.\n\n81\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.050\nBut that doesn't mean\nthat you can do anything.\n\n82\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.438\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It means that you are allowed to do\n\n83\n00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:47.320\ncertain things.\n\n84\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.810\nYou are allowed to go in and investigate.\n\n85\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.910\nYou are allowed to try to\nsafe guard that life, right?\n\n86\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.550\nWe can stop somebody from\ntrying to shoot somebody\n\n87\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.990\nby shooting them if there's\na clear threat, present danger.\n\n88\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.702\nBut that doesn't mean we can then go and\nbroadly search, and do anything we wanna\n\n89\n00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:06.738\ndo within that scene until we have\nestablished certain parameters.\n\n90\n00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.192\nUntil we understand better\nwhat has happened, and\n\n91\n00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:13.359\nuntil depending on the circumstances, we\nmay have received additional permission in\n\n92\n00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.841\nthe form of writing, typically\na search warrant, from an authorized,\n\n93\n00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.435\nin this case probably a court of law\njudge, has issued a warrant that says,\n\n94\n00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.410\nyes you're allowed to go search.\n\n95\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.570\nNow if it's a crime scene we happen on\nafter the fact, very different, right?\n\n96\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.090\nWe walk in, and there are unfortunately\nbodies, perhaps laying on the ground.\n\n97\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.460\nSomebody's been harmed,\nthere's clear evidence of a crime.\n\n98\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.150\nWe at that point may be able to operate\ndifferently, we're able to investigate,\n\n99\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.780\nwe're able to go look in the pockets of\nthe person that may have been harmed that\n\n100\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.630\nwas attacked, because now they're part of\nwhat happened, part of the crime scene.\n\n101\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.090\nSo it does depend on circumstances,\nas you rightly point out.\n\n102\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.790\nAnd it depends on what we are being\nasked to do in the circumstances,\n\n103\n00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.930\nor then surround the circumstances\nthat we find ourselves to be involved.\n\n104\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.920\nI'll have a lot more to say about\nthat in coming discussions.\n\n105\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.956\nBut the objectives of\ncomputer forensics overall,\n\n106\n00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.721\nthinking through the logic\nof what we wanna do.\n\n107\n00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.400\nI'm gonna actually put a list up here.\n\n108\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.690\nIf you just bear with me for\none second, there we go.\n\n109\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.170\nIf we can go full screen,\njust so you can see this.\n\n110\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.210\nThat way we don't cut\noff there on the margin.\n\n111\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.100\nAnd a lot of this stuff we'll talk\nabout in these beginning episodes is\n\n112\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.180\ngonna involve me throwing\nup a list of things.\n\n113\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.350\nEspecially as we get into the rules\nof evidence, and talk through them.\n\n114\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.810\nBecause there's just a lot of verbage,\n\n115\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.650\nand a lot of detail that you\nwanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n116\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.240\nAll of this is in the show notes,\nobviously encourage\n\n117\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.870\nyou as we always do to take a look and\nuse those as a guide to help you prepare.\n\n118\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.340\nNot only to apply this\nknowledge in the real world,\n\n119\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.690\nbut those of you that may be looking\nto go on and perhaps study for and\n\n120\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.220\ntake one or more exams in this case to see\nat your final exam, you would wanna use\n\n121\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.470\nthis information to help you to prepare,\nso objectives of computer forensic.\n\n122\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.800\nNot an exhaustive list, but\ncertainly a major point list if you will.\n\n123\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.580\nThings that are very likely to be\nconsidered main objectives are on this\n\n124\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.310\nlist, and identifying, gathering, and\n\n125\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.810\npreserving evidence of a cyber\ncrime in this case, right?\n\n126\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.180\nWould be at the top of the list.\n\n127\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.340\nTracking and prosecuting perpetrators\nthat may have executed this crime in\n\n128\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.060\nwhatever court of law has jurisdiction,\nwherever the crime was committed we\n\n129\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.370\nwould seek to then gain\naccess to the court there and\n\n130\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.270\nprosecute a case if appropriate,\nif we have evidence, if we are allowed to.\n\n131\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.410\nIn that jurisdiction,\nwe'll talk more about jurisdiction and\n\n132\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.960\nthe ability to be able to deal with the\nspecific interpretation of law by country\n\n133\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.610\nin upcoming conversations as well.\n\n134\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.570\nBut remember, law generically\n\n135\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.030\nis the same everywhere we go in\nthe sense that almost without exception,\n\n136\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.090\nevery country will have a set of laws that\naddresses things like what is a crime?\n\n137\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.330\nHow was it committed?\n\n138\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.150\nUnder what circumstances do we or don't\nwe have the right to seek redress and\n\n139\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.800\nto prosecute a court or\nrather prosecute a crime that occurred?\n\n140\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.590\nBut every country will interpret\ntheir laws differently,\n\n141\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.140\nwill apply them differently, and\nwill draft them differently.\n\n142\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.180\nAnd as a broad statement, not every\ncountry will be different because many\n\n143\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.650\ncountries come from the perspective or\n\n144\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.430\nshare the perspective of a common\nfoundation for their legal systems,\n\n145\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.890\nwhether it's common law under the English\nsystem or whatever the case may be.\n\n146\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.950\nAnd as a result,\nthere's a lot of similarity there.\n\n147\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.290\nBut there are unique differences and\nsubtle differences that we need to be\n\n148\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.410\naware of as forensics experts,\nas investigators, as representatives of\n\n149\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.880\na process that allows us to gather\ninformation and allows us to do so\n\n150\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.550\non a forensically sound and appropriate\nway following the rules of evidence.\n\n151\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.990\nWhatever they may be\nbased on the locality and\n\n152\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.970\nthe legal jurisdictions enforced there.\n\n153\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.470\nAnd following and establishing\na chain of custody of evidence for\n\n154\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.580\nan important term that we'll come\nback to time and again here.\n\n155\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.820\nWe have to follow the rules in other\nwords and play the game correctly.\n\n156\n00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.468\nTo then seek the end game that\nwe're looking for, and hopefully,\n\n157\n00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.520\nif everything goes well.\n\n158\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.879\nAnd we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat somebody legitimately seems to have\n\n159\n00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.510\nengaged in these activities.\n\n160\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.300\nBring them before the court and\nallow a jury or a judge depending on the.\n\n161\n00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.990\nCourt that we are in and the kind of legal\nsystem we are involved with to render\n\n162\n00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.730\na ruling as to whether they\nare innocent or guilty.\n\n163\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.990\nAnd if innocent,\nallow them to go on their way.\n\n164\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.910\nIf guilty, allow for some sort of\npunishment, whatever may be allowed and\n\n165\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.650\napplicable under the law to be assigned,\nwhether it's a criminal case or\n\n166\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.860\na civil case.\n\n167\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.330\nAgain, depending on the kind of law and\nlegal system we're in\n\n168\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.620\ncriminal case would involve traditionally\njail time, if found guilty.\n\n169\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.910\nWhereas a civil case would traditionally\ninvolve some sort of financial penalty,\n\n170\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.865\nif you are found guilty.\n\n171\n00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.570\nAnd there may be some other\nthings that go on with that, but\n\n172\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.835\nthose are the main thought processes\naround criminal versus civil cases.\n\n173\n00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:39.745\nSo we have to think about\nthese things as we think about\n\n174\n00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:41.785\nthe objectives of computer forensics.\n\n175\n00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:45.117\nWe also have to look at the fact\nthat we may interpret document and\n\n176\n00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.830\npresent evidence and\nhave to do so, as I mentioned,\n\n177\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.432\nin an admissible way that would allow for\nprosecution to take place.\n\n178\n00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:55.986\nAgain, if appropriate, if the evidence\nwarrants that, supports it, and\n\n179\n00:08:55.986 --> 00:09:00.538\nleads to the decision in our minds and\nour ability to present that in a court of\n\n180\n00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:04.237\nlaw and a court of our peers that\nthere seems to be wrongdoing,\n\n181\n00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:08.022\nseems to be malfeasance that\nwe want to pursue in some way.\n\n182\n00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:13.172\nSo if we walk into a crime scene,\nfind evidence overwhelmingly of some\n\n183\n00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:18.083\nsort of crime taking place and\none or more people's involvement.\n\n184\n00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.939\nIf we handled it correctly should be\nable to then present that evidence after\n\n185\n00:09:21.939 --> 00:09:25.027\nan exhaustive methodological\napproach that's supplied.\n\n186\n00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:28.561\nAnd we'll go through what the steps are,\nthe rules of forensic investigation, and\n\n187\n00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.710\nthe way in which we apply that\nmethodology here in a couple of minutes.\n\n188\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.766\nBut assuming we do that, we should\nthen have the opportunity to present\n\n189\n00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:38.943\nthat information in front of a court,\nand proceed, and\n\n190\n00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:42.478\nbe a part of that investigation,\nculminating in that trial.\n\n191\n00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:47.271\nAnd allow the prosecution and the defense\nto present their versions of that story,\n\n192\n00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:49.132\nrefute or accept our evidence.\n\n193\n00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:50.807\nAnd then, depending on what happens,\n\n194\n00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:53.610\nseeing whether that person\nis found innocent or guilty.\n\n195\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.780\nAnd that is the process at a high level,\nand that's what should happen.\n\n196\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.084\nThe idea is, and this very important\nthought process will be started out,\n\n197\n00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:04.380\nbegin our conversations through\nthe logic of what CHFI?\n\n198\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.603\nWhat hacking forensic investigation means?\n\n199\n00:10:06.603 --> 00:10:10.125\nUltimately what cyber crime is and\nhow digitally, how we go through digital\n\n200\n00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:13.870\nforensics and computer forensics to\nunderstand how we are supposed to operate,\n\n201\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.000\ngather evidence, to present it.\n\n202\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.340\nOne of the overarching and underlying\nassumptions we must make at all times\n\n203\n00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.110\nas investigators is that everything\nwe do will be under scrutiny.\n\n204\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.185\nEverything we do can potentially be used\nin the court of law to present evidence,\n\n205\n00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.205\nshould there be a compelling\nreason to do so.\n\n206\n00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:33.355\nWe always have to operate under\nthe assumption that that will be the case.\n\n207\n00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:35.445\nMeaning, we must always\nfollow the rules of evidence,\n\n208\n00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:39.305\nwe must always act appropriately, follow\nour code of ethic, whatever that is.\n\n209\n00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.335\nFollow the standards of our occupation,\n\n210\n00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:44.285\nour industry and\nthe appropriate rules that govern that.\n\n211\n00:10:44.285 --> 00:10:47.189\nWe'll talk about where some of those\nthings may come from here as we go.\n\n212\n00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.389\nAnd making sure that we understand\nhow to always, without exception,\n\n213\n00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.171\noperate in a way that creates\nauditability, verifiability and\n\n214\n00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:57.002\nvalidity in everything we do.\n\n215\n00:10:57.002 --> 00:11:01.001\nSo that any action we take can be\nquestioned, cross referenced and validated\n\n216\n00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:05.015\nto be and the assumption will be,\nthat it can be proven to be legitimate.\n\n217\n00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:07.905\nAnd if we do that, we are then\nhandling evidence, gathering it,\n\n218\n00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:12.105\nanalyzing it, maintaining it through\na chain of custody in the appropriate way.\n\n219\n00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:15.295\nIf we act in a way that calls\nour activities into question.\n\n220\n00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:18.467\nIf we don't follow the rules of evidence,\nif we're not appropriately\n\n221\n00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:22.217\nacting in ways that would allow us\nto demonstrate that we've done so,\n\n222\n00:11:22.217 --> 00:11:26.607\nwe are not following the rules of\nour industry, of our profession.\n\n223\n00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:29.297\nWe are violating those rules,\nand we are not acting\n\n224\n00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:33.287\nin accordance with the rules of evidence\nand the forensic handling of data.\n\n225\n00:11:33.287 --> 00:11:34.767\nAnd we are not doing ourselves,\n\n226\n00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:37.457\ndoing anybody involved with\nthe investigation any good.\n\n227\n00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:40.880\nWe're actually creating a situation\nwhere evidence that is found,\n\n228\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.760\nit's gonna be thrown out.\n\n229\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.260\nIt's not gonna be admissible and\n\n230\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.270\nwe're actually doing harm\nas opposed to doing good.\n\n231\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.750\nAnd that is not what we want\nto do at any point in time.\n\n232\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.820\nSo just understand the logic of that.\n\n233\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.622\nEstimating potential impact of a malicious\nactivity and what that outcome may be.\n\n234\n00:11:54.622 --> 00:11:56.352\nAnd try to help investigators and\n\n235\n00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:00.365\npeople involved to understand the impact\nof the crime, is part of what we do or\n\n236\n00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.110\npotentially part of\nthe responsibilities we have.\n\n237\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.630\nWanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n238\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.380\nFinding vulnerabilities and security\nloopholes that may help attackers to\n\n239\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.460\nexecute on there, nefarious,\nor bad, or evil activities.\n\n240\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.968\nAlways good to think about that.\n\n241\n00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:17.130\nAnd a lot of times\nthe computer forensic thought\n\n242\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.644\nprocess is a little bit broader than\nperhaps we understand it to be.\n\n243\n00:12:21.644 --> 00:12:23.433\nAnd I talk to a lot of people about this,\n\n244\n00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:26.320\na lot of people that are engaged\nin forensic activity.\n\n245\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.360\nBut people are looking to get in to this\nindustry, looking to do this particular\n\n246\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.340\nset of things, or engage in these\nactivities, don't always understand that\n\n247\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.520\nit's not just about what happens after\nthe fact and investigation of that.\n\n248\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.470\nBut it's also the proactive\napproach to understanding and\n\n249\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.850\nidentifying vulnerabilities,\nwe would call weaknesses vulnerabilities.\n\n250\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.410\nThese terms are synonymous.\n\n251\n00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.849\nAnd that we have a proactive role to play,\nnot just a reactive role.\n\n252\n00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:54.518\nInstead of response, it is\na traditionally reactive environmental,\n\n253\n00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:56.634\nset of activities we engage in.\n\n254\n00:12:56.634 --> 00:13:00.876\nAnd computer forensics is going to fall\nunder the overarching thought process\n\n255\n00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.170\nof incident response.\n\n256\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.660\nThat's the massive container that we\nslip computer forensics up underneath.\n\n257\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.264\nAnd we engaged in those activities as\npart of incident response traditionally,\n\n258\n00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:11.940\na subset of them in other words.\n\n259\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.190\nSo people tend to think of us as being\nthose people that show up after the fact,\n\n260\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.220\nput up the hey caution crime\nscene tape and go do our thing.\n\n261\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.390\nAnd we never are there until something\nthat happens in other words.\n\n262\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.066\nThat is very true traditionally and\nthat is 99% of what we do.\n\n263\n00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:30.783\nBut there is this element of\nbeing able to be risk averse and\n\n264\n00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:33.675\nbe able to understand that we\ncan identify vulnerabilities.\n\n265\n00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:36.943\nManage risk in such a way\nthat we can offer guidance,\n\n266\n00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:41.034\nthat because of lessons learned\nthrough reactive activities and\n\n267\n00:13:41.034 --> 00:13:45.493\nengagement around the incident response,\nif we take that logically,\n\n268\n00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:49.270\nroll that forward, and\npresent that to the organization.\n\n269\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.580\nWe may be able to offer proactive\nguidance about what to do to\n\n270\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.870\nprevent this from either recurring or\nhappening in a different way,\n\n271\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.720\na variance,\nwhatever it may be going forward.\n\n272\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.840\nAnd we often misrepresent that or\n\n273\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.440\njust don't really make that clear as\npart of what computer forensics can do.\n\n274\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.450\nJust want to call that out to you,\nvery important.\n\n275\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.280\nUnderstanding techniques,\nmethodologies of the attackers.\n\n276\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.690\nAgain, relaying that knowledge\nforward becomes very important.\n\n277\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.850\nThings like honeypots and\nhoneynets, for instance,\n\n278\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.070\nwould be a good example of a tangible\nway that incident response and\n\n279\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.870\ncomputer forensics can be used to\nlearn from things that are going on.\n\n280\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.615\nAnd then pay that forward to create\na different response pattern,\n\n281\n00:14:27.615 --> 00:14:31.275\na different capability, and\ntherefore, different security stance.\n\n282\n00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:33.825\nModifying the enterprise\nsecurity architecture\n\n283\n00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:36.555\nwould be the outcome of this if\nit was done the correct way.\n\n284\n00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:42.717\nAnd allowing us as a result to decide that\nwe will make changes because of that.\n\n285\n00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:46.941\nPotentially cut off an avenue of ingress,\nan avenue for attack to come in.\n\n286\n00:14:46.941 --> 00:14:50.395\nAnd this is also sometimes\ncommonly referred to as ASR,\n\n287\n00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:54.740\nAttack Surface Reduction or ASLR,\nAttack Surface Level Reduction.\n\n288\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.746\nWhere we're trying to reduce the footprint\nof the vulnerabilities in systems and\n\n289\n00:14:58.746 --> 00:15:02.360\ntherefore, reduce the number of\nattack vectors that may be available.\n\n290\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.610\nThat a bad actor or\nthreat actor may be able to take on.\n\n291\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.420\nSo these are some thoughts about things\nthat objectives of computer forensics may\n\n292\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.130\nallow us to engage around.\n\n293\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.600\nRecover deletion or recover deleted files,\n\n294\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.110\ndeleted information, hidden files\nthings like steghide graphically.\n\n295\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.010\nModified files for instance.\n\n296\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.895\nTemporary data in caches and registers.\n\n297\n00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:26.308\nAll that kind of stuff that we call\nvolatile data in terms of the kind of data\n\n298\n00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:28.980\nthat we look at would be earmarked for\nthat.\n\n299\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.607\nAlso performing incidence responses,\n\n300\n00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:33.680\nI mentioned would be one of those key\ncriteria's that we focused on as well.\n\n301\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.980\nThere are different types of data\nthat we examine and look at.\n\n302\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.538\nThere is nonvolatile data and\n\n303\n00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:42.510\nvolatile data when we think about\nthe types of data that we examine.\n\n304\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.090\nYou may also see a third type sometimes\nreferenced remnant or residual data.\n\n305\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.538\nThat is a category, but\nyou could say it's traditionally part of,\n\n306\n00:15:51.538 --> 00:15:53.732\npotentially the volatile data.\n\n307\n00:15:53.732 --> 00:15:56.924\nBecause oftentimes that's data that\nis left in places where it may\n\n308\n00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.924\nnot be there where we shut the system off.\n\n309\n00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:03.554\nYou also see it in the static data or\nthe data that is nonvolatile, because\n\n310\n00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:08.404\nAgain if we erase a hard drive in theory,\nformatting it to block access to data\n\n311\n00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:13.060\nthere may still be remnant or residual\ndata that is left on the hard drive.\n\n312\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.590\nAnd that is something that will be static,\nit would be there if\n\n313\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.260\nyou power on power off cycles but we have\nto have special tools to go find it.\n\n314\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.310\nWhether its the DD Tool in Linux which\nwould allow us to create a drive image and\n\n315\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.390\nthen look for that.\n\n316\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.940\nWhether it is some sort of drive\nimaging tool that we use in Windows,\n\n317\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.710\nor any combination of those things,\nwouldn't really matter.\n\n318\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.220\nBut creating a bit-by-bit drive\nimage would allow us to then\n\n319\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.800\nexamine the sectors of the drive,\nlooking for remnant data and finding it.\n\n320\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.136\nSo there's multiple types of data that we\nmay work with and want to be aware of.\n\n321\n00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:45.275\nAnd volatile data, while it is\nequally important or as important as\n\n322\n00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:49.996\nnon-volatile data, equally important and\nas important as residual data,\n\n323\n00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:54.011\nit is the most perishable,\nthe most fragile, of the data types.\n\n324\n00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:58.840\nCuz if we power down the system or in\nanyway modify the configuration of certain\n\n325\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.497\nareas of the system,\nwe may erase of irreparably damage and\n\n326\n00:17:02.497 --> 00:17:06.550\nremove that volatile data and\nthat can be a bit of a concern for us.\n\n327\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.780\nSo one example,\n\n328\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.040\nif you give me one second just to get\nto a command prompt and bring this up.\n\n329\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.410\nIf you wanna take a look here real\nquick we're in a Windows 10 machine.\n\n330\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.960\nJust to give you a quick example\nof what I'm talking about,\n\n331\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.630\nwe've talked about volatile and\nperishable data.\n\n332\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.790\nThere is lots of different data\nthat we could look at, for\n\n333\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.730\ninstance we may look at netstat and\n\n334\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.880\nthe netstat tool, network statistics has\na bunch of switches associated with it.\n\n335\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.955\nIf we use the netstat -a switch we will\nsee the state of open port connections for\n\n336\n00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.414\nboth TCP and UDP on the adapter.\n\n337\n00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:42.159\nWhatever adapter or adapters, if I have\nmore than one I would specify the adapter\n\n338\n00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:46.240\nin question, are available, and the\ninbound connections and the state of them.\n\n339\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.870\nNow this data is volatile,\nit's perishable.\n\n340\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.060\nIf I power off the system this data goes\naway and I would not be able to see it.\n\n341\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.670\nThis would be stuff that\nas a forensic investigator,\n\n342\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.870\nI would have to gather from the system.\n\n343\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.300\nWhether its Windows based,\nan Apple based system, Linux unit based.\n\n344\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.630\nThis is a protocol stack,\na networking stack tool and function.\n\n345\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.300\nThis is going to approximately work\nthe same way regardless of OS that we use.\n\n346\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.720\nAnd the network statistics information\nshould be gathered as part of\n\n347\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.130\nthe gathering of volatile data,\nregardless of the system that we're on.\n\n348\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.420\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n349\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.710\nFor instance, we may look at NBT stat.\n\n350\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.290\nAnother tool that will\nallow us to see information\n\n351\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.370\nin the name resolution cache of the\nsystem, in this case a Windows machine.\n\n352\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.890\nThis one would be specific\nto a Windows machine.\n\n353\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.510\nWe don't use net BIOS traditionally on\nother systems, so we would see it there.\n\n354\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.440\nBut those two entries,\nSVR 12 right here and VM host right here,\n\n355\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.530\nand the IP addresses associated with them,\nthat is information that is going to be,\n\n356\n00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.500\nagain, volatile.\n\n357\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.010\nIt'll be there for a period of time.\n\n358\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.910\nYou could see life for seconds there\nbetween the right-hand column, the TTL,\n\n359\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.870\ntill we tick down to 0,\n\n360\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.300\nwhere that information is removed\nfrom the cache by the system.\n\n361\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.270\nDepending on when I interrogate this\nsystem, as I come across it during\n\n362\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.200\nthe commission of an investigation, I may\nor may not find anything in that cache.\n\n363\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.930\nBut if I found something, I would have\nto capture it and understand what it is.\n\n364\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.190\nBecause that will eventually, within\nfive to six minutes, maybe ten minutes,\n\n365\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.720\ndepending on what it is.\n\n366\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.250\nJust under ten minutes now,\nthat would disappear.\n\n367\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.910\nIf I didn't do anything with it,\ndidn't use it within ten minutes,\n\n368\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.890\nthat information would essentially\njust evaporate, it would be gone.\n\n369\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.700\nWe would have to be aware of that and\nknow that as well, right?\n\n370\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.840\nSo there's different\nways we can look at this.\n\n371\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.850\nWe could look at IP\nconfiguration information.\n\n372\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.846\nWhich is static on a machine and\nthat's gonna be there regardless.\n\n373\n00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:41.440\nAnd we can use IP config\nto see basic information,\n\n374\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.780\nwe can use the all switch to extend\nthat and see more information.\n\n375\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:51.360\nBut if, instead, we want to take a look at\nwhat is in the DNS resolver cache, again,\n\n376\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.380\nwe would get information that is volatile,\nthat will be there for a period of time.\n\n377\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.060\nBut that would be removed if\nI powered-down the system or\n\n378\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.810\nif I flushed the cache, or\nany combination of those things.\n\n379\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.400\nSo we'd want to capture that information.\n\n380\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.830\nThese are 3 or 4 different examples of\ninformation that would be considered to be\n\n381\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.130\nvolatile, that would be considered to be\ninformation that would have to be captured\n\n382\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.840\nduring the current present state of\nthe system to be acceptable, usable, and\n\n383\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.990\nreferencable during an investigation.\n\n384\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:24.204\nIf I look at something like\nthe routing table and I did a, whoops.\n\n385\n00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:32.310\nI did the route command and\nI did something like route print, right?\n\n386\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.340\nAnd I went in and\nI looked at the routing table.\n\n387\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.530\nI would see, for the most part,\n\n388\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.970\nstatic information that is in\nthe routing table on the local machine.\n\n389\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.510\nAnd I wouldn't necessarily, both for\nIPv6 and IPv4, wouldn't necessarily\n\n390\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.570\nhave to worry about capturing that with\nthe machine powered on, although we'd\n\n391\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.500\nprobably want a record of it, just to have\nit, because this information is static.\n\n392\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.320\nIt's probably not gonna change\nwhen I power off the machine and\n\n393\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.380\npower it back on, because those are static\nentries that are not gonna go away.\n\n394\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.800\nSo it depends on the nature of\nthe data that I'm looking at.\n\n395\n00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.300\nBut a forensic investigator would have\nto have all of this running around in\n\n396\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.870\ntheir head and\n\n397\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.790\nhave the knowledge of where we find\nthis data, the knowledge of the tools.\n\n398\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.150\nAnd all I did was use three or four\ndifferent commands that were available\n\n399\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.310\nto anybody who knows about networking and\nhow networking and\n\n400\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.710\nthe tools associated with it in\nan operating system would function.\n\n401\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.100\nYou may not be familiar with those tools,\nand if you're not, definitely encourage\n\n402\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.290\nyou to look at the help file in any one\nof the tools we just demonstrated and\n\n403\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.450\nread up a little bit about them.\n\n404\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.080\nAnd make sure you are familiar with them.\n\n405\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.850\nMaybe go back and\nlook at some of the network plus content\n\n406\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.410\nthat we have in the ITProTV library where\nwould examine these tools in more depth.\n\n407\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.460\nAnd I'm sure there's going to be\na lot of great content out there.\n\n408\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.900\nAny of the Cisco content as well.\n\n409\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.680\nProbably the entry level CCNA\ncontent would go through\n\n410\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.390\na lot of these tools in great detail.\n\n411\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.380\nSo there's a lot of places you could\nfigure out how to latch onto and\n\n412\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.350\nget some additional depth on\nthe information we're just\n\n413\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.980\nreally throwing out here as an example for\nyou.\n\n414\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.740\nBut regardless of where you find out\nabout it, regardless of what you do or\n\n415\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.590\ndon't know, and how you educate yourself,\nbecause that is important.\n\n416\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.770\nBut regardless,\n\n417\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.310\nthe forensic investigator would have to\nbring to bear knowledge of these tools and\n\n418\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.700\nknowledge of the volatility, and the the\norder of volatilities, we've talked about\n\n419\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.650\nof data to be able to manage and interact\nwith this data in a meaningful way.\n\n420\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.230\nNow, could we just simply\ndo what I just did here.\n\n421\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.280\nAnd let's just take this one step further.\n\n422\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.470\nJust go down here to a command\nprompt where we can see everything.\n\n423\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.420\nLet me just clear this screen out here for\none second,\n\n424\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.190\nmake it a little bit easier for\nus to work with.\n\n425\n00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.040\nAnd let's say that we did.\n\n426\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.830\nLet me just bring this up one more time.\n\n427\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.430\nLet's go back through\nour commands right here.\n\n428\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.640\nAnd let's do our ipconfig\ndisplay DNS one more time.\n\n429\n00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.780\nLet's say that I wanna capture\nthat information volatile\n\n430\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.330\ninformation in the resolver cache,\nthe DNS resolver cache.\n\n431\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.456\nI wanna capture that,\nnow there're several ways to do this.\n\n432\n00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:51.250\nI could, cuz it's so large,\nit's scrolling through,\n\n433\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.790\nI couldn't just screen capture it,\ncuz there's too much data there.\n\n434\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.270\nI could output that to\na file of some kind, right?\n\n435\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.270\nSo I could do something like this.\n\n436\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.500\nPipe, or cat, or out that to a file.\n\n437\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:11.345\nSo maybe I could do something like And\n\n438\n00:23:11.345 --> 00:23:17.590\nthen dnscache.txt, right?\n\n439\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.970\nAnd I don't have a directory\ncalled catch me, so I'm just gonna\n\n440\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:25.920\ngo create one really quickly, so just bear\nwith me here once second while I do that.\n\n441\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.690\nWhere is this PC?\n\n442\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.439\nAnd, so if I go in here,\n\n443\n00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:37.128\nand I want to just go in and do.\n\n444\n00:23:37.128 --> 00:23:39.073\nI'm gonna call that Catch me, right?\n\n445\n00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:45.202\nAll right, so\nif I did something like that, and\n\n446\n00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:50.020\nI do that, I would be able to\ncatch that data literally, right?\n\n447\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.207\nIn the Catch me folder and I have it\nright there, you can see dnscache.txt and\n\n448\n00:23:54.207 --> 00:23:56.601\nyou could open that up and\nI got everything.\n\n449\n00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.697\nSo that's, in theory, all you need to\ndo but here is the problem with that,\n\n450\n00:24:00.697 --> 00:24:04.857\nI just modified the hard drive, the C\ndrive specifically by adding a file to it\n\n451\n00:24:04.857 --> 00:24:07.293\nwhile I was trying to\ncapture volatile data.\n\n452\n00:24:07.293 --> 00:24:10.702\nNow from a forensic standpoint,\na rule of evidence standpoint, and\n\n453\n00:24:10.702 --> 00:24:13.527\na forensic investigation and\nmethodology standpoint,\n\n454\n00:24:13.527 --> 00:24:16.250\nI just made the biggest\nmistake I could possibly make.\n\n455\n00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.797\nI might as well stop at this point,\nthrow down the mic, we should go home.\n\n456\n00:24:19.797 --> 00:24:20.630\nLet's go grab lunch because we're done.\n\n457\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.500\nAnd that's it, because I screwed up.\n\n458\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.870\nI screwed up big time.\n\n459\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.910\nAnd what I did was I modified\nthe integrity of the hard drive and\n\n460\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.840\nthe state of the hard drive,\nby adding this file to it,\n\n461\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.760\nwhile I'm supposed to be investigating it.\n\n462\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.985\nAnd the number one rule is,\n\n463\n00:24:34.985 --> 00:24:38.092\nyou don't modify the hard drive\nwhen you're trying to gather data.\n\n464\n00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:40.640\nAnd what I would have to\ndo is gather that data.\n\n465\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.480\nBut instead of outputting it to\nthe C drive, I'd have to output it\n\n466\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.090\nto an external drive that uses\nsomething called a right blocker.\n\n467\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.290\nA tool that would prevent write back,\nprevent the adding, modifying, or\n\n468\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.190\nin any way, changing add, remove,\nmodify, delete, anything.\n\n469\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.970\nAny kind of information\non the source drive.\n\n470\n00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.190\nSo I'd have to take this\ninformation off to a thumb drive,\n\n471\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.950\nsomething like that whatever it would be.\n\n472\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.586\nAnd they'd have to do that in what\nwe'd say is a forensically sound way\n\n473\n00:25:07.586 --> 00:25:11.451\nin order to capture this\ninformation have it be accurate.\n\n474\n00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:15.742\nMake sure we have integrity associated\nwith it in that it would be acceptable but\n\n475\n00:25:15.742 --> 00:25:19.590\nto validate that I did it in a way\nthat doesn't modify the source.\n\n476\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.590\nBecause then I call into question\nthe validity of all the other data,\n\n477\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.410\nall the other evidence that I find on\nthat hard drive while I'm examining it.\n\n478\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.390\nNone of it, in other words, would be\nthen admissible potentially as evidence.\n\n479\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.770\nSo I violate the rule by\nwriting it to the local drive.\n\n480\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.460\nI have to make sure I put it\noff the system in such a way\n\n481\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.430\nthat I don't allow it to actually interact\nwith or in any way modify, right?\n\n482\n00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.690\nWhat I'm doing locally.\n\n483\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.330\nAnd so write blockers are one of the tools\nthat are in the investigative tool kit.\n\n484\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:53.610\nA piece of hardware that will allow us to\nexfiltrate to, exit data out of the system\n\n485\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.580\nin a one way path without infiltrating,\nwithout putting data back into the system.\n\n486\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.500\nWriting files to the hard drive\nmodifies the hard drive registers,\n\n487\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.670\nmodifies the information about\nwhen files were accessed,\n\n488\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.940\nwhen they were created, moves bits of data\naround on the hard drive platter itself.\n\n489\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.160\nWe'll talk about all this\nstuff on upcoming episodes.\n\n490\n00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.280\nAnd modifies the file map overall.\n\n491\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.930\nAnd as a result, could potentially\noverwrite volatile data that's remnant\n\n492\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.400\ndata that's sitting on the hard\ndrive that may have been evidence.\n\n493\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.893\nI may have just overwritten a file that\nI was actually looking to investigate in\n\n494\n00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:23.475\nthe first place.\n\n495\n00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:24.740\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n496\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.258\n&gt;&gt; That would not be good.\n\n497\n00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:27.720\nWe could say that would be bad.\n\n498\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.840\nThat would be accurate.\n\n499\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.630\nRight, so just a quick demonstration for\nyou as to all the things\n\n500\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.510\nthat have been churning around in\nyour head while you start to do this.\n\n501\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.082\nYou gotta be juggling all\nthese balls in the air,\n\n502\n00:26:39.082 --> 00:26:42.722\nkeeping track of where evidence is,\nfiguring out how to capture it so\n\n503\n00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:46.800\nthat it doesn't disappear, but\ndoing so in a forensically sound way.\n\n504\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.500\nThis is tough work, this is not easy.\n\n505\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.350\nPeople thing, they see this on TV,\nit's cool, it's sexy.\n\n506\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.495\nI'm gonna wear the cool shades, drive\na cool car, carry a gun and shoot people.\n\n507\n00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:57.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way, at least,\n\n508\n00:26:57.146 --> 00:26:59.631\nyou're not supposed to,\nanyway, it's not good, right?\n\n509\n00:26:59.631 --> 00:27:01.040\nNow, it doesn't work that way, right?\n\n510\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.670\nThis is incredible exciting and\ninteresting work, but\n\n511\n00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.140\nit's also very intensive.\n\n512\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.450\nYou gotta really be able to keep a lot\nof things straight in your head.\n\n513\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.820\nYou gotta understand methodology,\nyou have to be detail-oriented.\n\n514\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.730\nAnd you have to be that kind\nof person that is patient and\n\n515\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.290\nwiling to follow the rules.\n\n516\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.620\nIf that's not you, not that I'm saying\nthat you shouldn't stick around.\n\n517\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.730\nShouldn't engage through these lessons,\nor that shouldn't spend time with us.\n\n518\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.970\nLove to have you go through this\nmaterial with us, but understand.\n\n519\n00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.082\nIf you struggle with the ability to work\ninside a box and be constrained by rules,\n\n520\n00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:34.080\nand are that kind of person that\njust does not like structure?\n\n521\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.025\nThis may not be a career path for you.\n\n522\n00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This may not be the best choice for\n\n523\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.800\nyou, you're probably\nwell-suited to be a hacker.\n\n524\n00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.430\nYou may not be well-suited to\nbe an investigator, right?\n\n525\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.810\nSo you may wanna think about defensive,\noffensive security things like that, but\n\n526\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.920\nmaybe investigative and\n\n527\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.060\nincident response security perspectives\nmay not be the perfect solution for you.\n\n528\n00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.430\nThat doesn't mean you\ncan't learn to do it.\n\n529\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.000\nIt just means that you may not\nhave the temperament, right?\n\n530\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.450\nThe personality that will let you do this\nprofessionally, to be happy doing it.\n\n531\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.950\nThat's all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n532\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.430\nSo just keep that in\nmind as we get started.\n\n533\n00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.920\nLots more to come certainly.\n\n534\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.710\nLots of things we have\nto be talking about.\n\n535\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.240\nA lot of stuff involved with just\nour overview conversation about\n\n536\n00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.040\nthe traditional state of\nforensics in the world today.\n\n537\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.630\nWe're gonna continue those\nconversations in upcoming episodes, but\n\n538\n00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.210\nbefore we do that,\nDaniel has to say something to you.\n\n539\n00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes I do, I have to say looks like\nwe're gonna have to go into Part 2,\n\n540\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.800\nbecause we are well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n541\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.480\n&gt;&gt; We are not.\nWe have like a minute left.\n\n542\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n543\n00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:27.106\n&gt;&gt; You make it sound like I rambled.\n\n544\n00:28:27.106 --> 00:28:29.317\n&gt;&gt; Adam's like I can get six bullet points\ndone in that whole minute, don't time me.\n\n545\n00:28:29.317 --> 00:28:31.876\n&gt;&gt; I could teach like another five\nminutes of stuff in a minute.\n\n546\n00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:34.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He probably could ladies and\ngentlemen, he's that good.\n\n547\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.920\nBut Adam, you're right.\n\n548\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.549\nI like how you talked\nabout the temperaments\n\n549\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.720\nof what it takes to be\nforensics investigator.\n\n550\n00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.900\nIt is about going down a checklist.\n\n551\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.710\nDo not get ahead of yourself.\n\n552\n00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.381\nDo not skirt outside of the rules.\n\n553\n00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:51.937\nBecause as soon as you do, you might now\nhave just completely blown up the entire\n\n554\n00:28:51.937 --> 00:28:56.365\ninvestigative process and now maybe\nthat evidence is no longer admissible.\n\n555\n00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:59.585\nAnd you're the guy that made that happen\nor you're the girl that made that happen,\n\n556\n00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:01.230\nso it's all about sticking to the rules.\n\n557\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.620\nIf that's not your mindset\neither get that way or\n\n558\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.991\nmaybe penetration testing is for\nyou, right?\n\n559\n00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:09.760\n[LAUGH] And look at that kind of stuff.\n\n560\n00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.320\nOther than that, Adam, you're right, we\nhave plenty more to talk about in upcoming\n\n561\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.270\nepisodes, but like I said, this episode,\nthe well has run dry for time, that is.\n\n562\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n563\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.550\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n564\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.123\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n565\n00:29:23.123 --> 00:29:25.535\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:31.191\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.327\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.526\nYou're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:13.845\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.696\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:18.266\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:23.655\nAnd today's episode, well, we are back\nwith more on our CHFI Version 9 series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.893\nContinuing our conversation on the state\nof computer forensics in today's world,\n\n10\n00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:32.189\njoining us back in the studio yet again to\ncontinue that topic, our good friend, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.930\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.276\nAdam, glad to have you back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:35.395\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.652\nI need a box,\nsomehow I've got to stand and be roughly,\n\n15\n00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:41.509\nyeah, I'm like a head\nshorter than I should be.\n\n16\n00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.363\n&gt;&gt; Just be glad Rob isn't\none of our hosts, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n18\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.047\n&gt;&gt; He makes me look short.\n\n19\n00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:46.869\n&gt;&gt; He makes you look short.\n\n20\n00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.341\nHe makes you look like me when\nwe're on camera together.\n\n21\n00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.222\nJust like shorty and the man.\n\n22\n00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:50.968\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n23\n00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:54.199\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, let's continue talking\n\n24\n00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.395\nabout CHFI, specifically,\nthe state of forensics in today's world.\n\n25\n00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:01.063\nWe left off in our last conversation,\nlaying some of the groundwork,\n\n26\n00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:05.250\nthe foundational discussions around\nwhat digital computer forensics is.\n\n27\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.754\nHow we define it, how we look at it.\n\n28\n00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:10.766\nThinking about the rules of evidence\na little bit, chain of custody,\n\n29\n00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:15.594\nthe thought process around different types\nof evidence, how we deal with that, and\n\n30\n00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:18.315\njust laying out some of\nthe thought processes.\n\n31\n00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:19.973\nThe elementary, if you will.\n\n32\n00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:22.046\nGreat TV series, by the way.\n\n33\n00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:22.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that show.\n\n34\n00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:26.210\n&gt;&gt; Johnny Lee-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, he was in Hackers.\n\n35\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.693\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes, at the lake 19\nyears old with Angelina Jolie.\n\n36\n00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:30.886\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nIt was great.\n\n37\n00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.084\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n38\n00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Way back in the day.\n\n39\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.267\nThey actually dated at one\npoint if I'm not mistaken.\n\n40\n00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:35.006\n&gt;&gt; Did they really?\n\n41\n00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.070\n&gt;&gt; I believe-\n&gt;&gt; Johnny Lee Miller.\n\n42\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.576\n&gt;&gt; Johnny Lee Miller, yeah I think they\nactually dated at one point briefly.\n\n43\n00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.850\nAnyway, irrelevant.\n\n44\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally we digress.\n\n45\n00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:45.737\nThat was our momentary digression.\n\n46\n00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:46.517\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n47\n00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.704\n&gt;&gt; So anyway we've laid down all that\nfoundational framework and knowledge.\n\n48\n00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:51.627\nWanted to pick back up that thread,\ntalk a bit about cyber crime.\n\n49\n00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:56.422\nWe talked about the different\nkinds of criminal versus civil\n\n50\n00:01:56.422 --> 00:02:00.757\nversus in this case\nadministrative trials we may see.\n\n51\n00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:02.721\nWe talked a bit about\nthe different kinds of trials and\n\n52\n00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.128\ninvestigative cases that may occur.\n\n53\n00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:06.888\nBut I hadn't really defined\nthe concept of cyber crime form, so\n\n54\n00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:09.430\nI thought we'd jump back there and\ntalk about that.\n\n55\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.241\nThe idea behind any kind of illicit,\nillegal activity taking place,\n\n56\n00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:17.130\ninvolving a computer of some kind,\nis how we would define cyber crime.\n\n57\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.848\nVery important to know know that we link\nthe concept of a computer being involved\n\n58\n00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.300\nin order to define it that way.\n\n59\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.521\nA network maybe involved as well.\n\n60\n00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.749\nRemember a network would be the idea\nof extending multiple computers,\n\n61\n00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.980\nconnecting them together, allowing them\nto exchange information with each other.\n\n62\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.848\nCan you build a network with one computer?\n\n63\n00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:36.732\nIt's like the sound of a hand clapping in\nthe forest when nobody's around, right?\n\n64\n00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:38.264\n&gt;&gt; Maybe with virtualization, you could?\n\n65\n00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:40.776\n&gt;&gt; No no, just in general I mean if\nyou think about the logic of it.\n\n66\n00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:41.972\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense, yeah.\n\n67\n00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:44.483\n&gt;&gt; Well, it doesn't but the idea is you\ncould have a network with no computers.\n\n68\n00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:47.300\nIf you think about the logic of it-\n&gt;&gt; Just nothing connected.\n\n69\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.659\n&gt;&gt; You could lay out the infrastructure,\nthe routing, the switching, etc,\n\n70\n00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.655\nit would be there, it just wouldn't\nbe extending information, or\n\n71\n00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:55.617\nexchanging it as you\nconnect devices to it.\n\n72\n00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:57.831\nYou enable the transmission\nof information across that.\n\n73\n00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:01.675\nIt would really just depend on semantics\nof how you choose to define the network.\n\n74\n00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:05.995\nIs it the actual plumbing or is it the\ndevices that connect to the plumbing that\n\n75\n00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.732\nmake the network the network?\n\n76\n00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:08.637\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n77\n00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:12.025\nI think most people define it\nas computers that are connected.\n\n78\n00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.801\nThere has to be devices,\nthere has to be talking.\n\n79\n00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:17.959\nEven if the infrastructure's there\nit's what good is it if it's not doing\n\n80\n00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:18.623\nanything?\n\n81\n00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:20.654\n&gt;&gt; It depends on if you're Cisco or\nyou're the rest of the world.\n\n82\n00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:21.232\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n83\n00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:23.053\nAnd by the way, I can clap with one hand.\n\n84\n00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:24.121\n&gt;&gt; You can?\n\n85\n00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.249\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n86\n00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.811\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna ask for a demonstration.\n\n87\n00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:28.695\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it's easy, just go like this.\n\n88\n00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:31.340\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Bravo,\n\n89\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.874\nI would clap [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You've now heard the sound of one\n\n90\n00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:34.457\nhand clapping.\n\n91\n00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:36.647\n&gt;&gt; I cannot do that so masterful, sir.\n\n92\n00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:39.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Masterful, absolutely enthralling.\n\n93\n00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:43.193\nAll right, so anyway,\nnow that we have totally and\n\n94\n00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:47.882\nutterly confused you and\nspoke about nothing of any significance.\n\n95\n00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:50.106\nLet's continue with where we were.\n\n96\n00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.135\n&gt;&gt; Sure was fun, though.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It was, I've never seen that,\n\n97\n00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:53.307\nI must honestly say.\n\n98\n00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:56.638\nAs scary as it was, I've never seen that,\nand hope never to again, by the way.\n\n99\n00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:58.774\nAll right, so anyway, just think about\nthe fact that we have to have a computer.\n\n100\n00:03:58.774 --> 00:04:02.186\nObviously we would extend that\nas we add computers together,\n\n101\n00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:05.925\nand as we talked about networking\nthem would allow us to incorporate\n\n102\n00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:08.605\nthe idea of a network\ninto this definition.\n\n103\n00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:12.745\nSo, computer, computers involved in\na crime network together, exchanging and\n\n104\n00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:14.905\nextending the reach for Information, and\n\n105\n00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.908\nthe exchange of information\nwould be incorporated there.\n\n106\n00:04:17.908 --> 00:04:21.736\nSystems and or applications running,\nso the software, the interfaces,\n\n107\n00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:24.240\nthe connectivity, and\nthe medium to exchange.\n\n108\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.719\nAll of that together, or individually\ncomponents of, could be part of a cyber\n\n109\n00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.337\ncrime, depending on what we're doing and\nhow we choose to approach that.\n\n110\n00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.127\nThere are internal cyber crimes.\n\n111\n00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.898\nInternal attacks, in other words,\n\n112\n00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:38.390\nattacks against infrastructure that\noccur from inside the perimeter.\n\n113\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.373\nSo essentially insider threats\nas we would talk about them, and\n\n114\n00:04:41.373 --> 00:04:42.711\nexternal attacks, right?\n\n115\n00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:47.460\nthe traditional threat actor from outside\nthe organization, hacking or breaking in.\n\n116\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.907\nWe think about the logic of this.\n\n117\n00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:54.231\nWe think about the fact that an attack,\na cyber crime of some kind, can occur\n\n118\n00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:58.820\npretty much under any circumstance,\nanywhere, on any kind of equipment.\n\n119\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.618\nIt's a question of,\nas forensic investigators, then going and\n\n120\n00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:05.243\nunwinding, figuring out and reproducing,\n\n121\n00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:09.536\ndocumenting the story and the trail of\nevents that lead up to that attack.\n\n122\n00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:13.808\nWherever it originated from, whatever\npoint of contact was used initially to\n\n123\n00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:17.188\nengage the system and\nlaunch the attack is part of that story.\n\n124\n00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:18.070\nWe have to understand that.\n\n125\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.790\nWe have to be able to tell that\nstory in a compelling way.\n\n126\n00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.752\nBut we have to understand that both\ninternal and external mechanisms or\n\n127\n00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:30.061\nmethodologies, as well as approaches,\nwill often be used.\n\n128\n00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:34.483\nAnd most attacks, believe it or not today,\nmajority of the attacks we address and\n\n129\n00:05:34.483 --> 00:05:39.030\ndeal with are coming from inside our\ndefensive parameters not from outside.\n\n130\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.478\nWe see a mounting numerical rise\nreally just to trend if you will,\n\n131\n00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:45.989\nthat is leading us to believe that\nmore and more insider attacks and\n\n132\n00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:48.934\ninsider threats are at the heart\nat a lot of the issues and\n\n133\n00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:51.654\nconcerns we see as security\nprofessionals today.\n\n134\n00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:53.601\nSo something just to be aware of.\n\n135\n00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:57.493\nWe talked about different types of cyber\ncrime in terms of the investigations and\n\n136\n00:05:57.493 --> 00:06:00.375\nultimately the cases that may\narise as a result of this.\n\n137\n00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:04.006\nWe have criminal cases, we have civil\ncases, we have administrative cases.\n\n138\n00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:07.139\nRemember, criminal cases tend\nto if you are found guilty,\n\n139\n00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.148\nmore often than not,\nwind up with some sort of jail time,\n\n140\n00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:14.757\nor penalty that is assessed that does\nnormally involve some sort of jail time.\n\n141\n00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:19.105\nCivil cases will traditionally involve\nsome sort of penalty, more often than not,\n\n142\n00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:22.289\nfinancial usually, so\nyou will assessed a fine of some kind or\n\n143\n00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.879\nsomething of that result\nif you are found guilty.\n\n144\n00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.794\nAnd administrative cases, or\nadministrative investigations that may\n\n145\n00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:31.626\nlead to cases,\nare usually not criminal in nature.\n\n146\n00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:35.985\nThey are not seen as being, hey you're\nguilty or not, hey you owe a penalty or\n\n147\n00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:36.521\nnot, but\n\n148\n00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:41.355\nrather they're often an internal focus of\nbusinesses they're used to understand,\n\n149\n00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:45.780\nand to unwind issues and events that\nhave occurred inside the business.\n\n150\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.754\nBut then are not gonna be handed over\nnecessarily to, let's say law enforcement,\n\n151\n00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:52.595\nand that are gonna be following\nthe traditional trajectory\n\n152\n00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.322\nof going up before a judge or a jury.\n\n153\n00:06:54.322 --> 00:06:57.117\nAnd having some sort of penalty or\nfine assessed but\n\n154\n00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.340\nthey're an internal thought process.\n\n155\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.275\nIf somebody violates a rule, and\nwe go ahead and we investigate and\n\n156\n00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:08.261\nmaybe then we write them up, or perhaps we\nput something in their permanent record,\n\n157\n00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.882\nmaybe even transfer them, who knows what?\n\n158\n00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:12.121\nMaybe even fire them.\n\n159\n00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:16.251\nWhatever the case may be,\nthese are administrative-related events.\n\n160\n00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.023\nThey're gonna be non-criminal,\nnon-authoritative in nature, in the sense\n\n161\n00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:24.440\nthat we're not worried about applying law\ndirectly, but rather policy and procedure.\n\n162\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.048\nAnd process are looked with regards\nto what you did internally.\n\n163\n00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:30.105\nAnd if you violated those,\nwe then have some sort of sanction or\n\n164\n00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:31.323\nway of dealing with you.\n\n165\n00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.773\nWe put you in the naughty chair for\na certain amount of time,\n\n166\n00:07:33.773 --> 00:07:34.710\nsomething like that.\n\n167\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.302\nSo let's keep that in mind as we\ngo back into our conversations.\n\n168\n00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:40.222\nWe have a set of standing rules for\nforensics investigation, and\n\n169\n00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:43.940\nit's probably a good idea to go through\nthem if you wanna take a look from here.\n\n170\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.641\nWe'll quickly put our window screen,\nyou'll be able to see those right there.\n\n171\n00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:52.155\nSo the rules of investigation with\nregards to forensic investigation,\n\n172\n00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:57.039\na standing set of rules, again not going\nto be Totally comprehensive in nature\n\n173\n00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.599\nin the sense that there are no more or\nless rules than ten.\n\n174\n00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:04.506\nBut a list that helps us to put into\nperspective what the rules begin to look\n\n175\n00:08:04.506 --> 00:08:05.400\nlike for us.\n\n176\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.770\nWe have traditionally,\n\n177\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.650\nhave to think about it we talked about\nthis in the last episode as well.\n\n178\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.918\nLimited access to and\nexamination of the original evidence.\n\n179\n00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:16.352\nTalked about the use of things\nlike right blockers, for instance.\n\n180\n00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:20.187\nTalks about the fact that we have to be\nvery careful with the original evidence\n\n181\n00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:23.490\nand understand how to examine it,\nanalyze it, catalog it.\n\n182\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.162\nMaintain it throughout the life cycle\nof the evidence within our care during\n\n183\n00:08:28.162 --> 00:08:30.282\nan investigation and a response.\n\n184\n00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:34.250\nBut we have do so in a way that does not\nin any way modify the original evidence.\n\n185\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.159\nSo we have to take that into account and\nbe very aware of that,\n\n186\n00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.803\nrecord all changes made to any and\nall evidence files.\n\n187\n00:08:39.803 --> 00:08:43.136\nWe talked about the need to establish and\nmaintain a chain of custody with regards\n\n188\n00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:45.900\nto evidence,\nvery important to be thinking about that.\n\n189\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.467\nCreating an evidence chain of custody,\nas I mentioned.\n\n190\n00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:51.150\nUsually, this is done in\nsome sort of a document.\n\n191\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.242\nWhether it's electronic of physical,\nnot as important as having a system and\n\n192\n00:08:56.242 --> 00:08:57.700\na standardized way of doing this.\n\n193\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.026\nEnsuring that everybody that handles\nthe evidence is going to have to sign in,\n\n194\n00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.854\ncheck out the evidence,\nvalidate their use of it.\n\n195\n00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:09.057\nHave an auditable trail and a verified\nset of standards as well as policies and\n\n196\n00:09:09.057 --> 00:09:12.821\nprocedures that are applied to all\nuse of that evidence throughout.\n\n197\n00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:16.918\nAgain it's lifecycle throughout the\nincident, throughout the investigation and\n\n198\n00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:20.392\npotentially into the trial, so\nI wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n199\n00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:24.720\nCapitalized, there I didn't bold,\nbut I did capitalize the word ALL.\n\n200\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.580\nAll access to evidence must be documented,\nmust be traceable, must be verifiable.\n\n201\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.285\nIf anybody for any reason is able to\naccess evidence and does not sign in,\n\n202\n00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:37.071\nin a log, does not follow.\n\n203\n00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:40.375\nAnd therefore document their\nactivities through a chain of custody,\n\n204\n00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.180\nthe evidence becomes unusable.\n\n205\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.538\nAnd if that is exposed and found out, not\njust that evidence, but potentially all\n\n206\n00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:50.963\nevidence gathered and handled through that\nchain of custody may become tainted and\n\n207\n00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:52.686\nwe may have a problem with that.\n\n208\n00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:54.821\nAnd that is something very important for\n\n209\n00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:57.600\nus to be aware of something\nto always focus on.\n\n210\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.050\nHave to have standards for investigation\nof all evidence, and they have to be\n\n211\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.090\napplied as you could see there follow and\ncomply with them at all times.\n\n212\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.220\nRegardless of who you are,\na lot of times you will see, so\n\n213\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.453\nand so has gone in and\naccessed this evidence.\n\n214\n00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:16.815\nAnd know they're a senior person, so we\ndon't have to worry about them signing in.\n\n215\n00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:18.548\nI just need to take that evidence out for\na minute,\n\n216\n00:10:18.548 --> 00:10:19.880\nlet me just look at it really quickly.\n\n217\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.578\nNo, not gonna sign the log, just going\nto stand right here and open it up and\n\n218\n00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:25.063\nlook at it, absolutely not.\n\n219\n00:10:25.063 --> 00:10:28.152\nYou sign the log, you follow the rules\njust like everybody else whether\n\n220\n00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:31.551\nyou're the most senior person or the most\njunior person in the organization,\n\n221\n00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:33.170\ntotally irrelevant.\n\n222\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.893\nEverybody follows the rules, that's the\nstanding order of the day, no exceptions,\n\n223\n00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:38.271\nmake sure you are aware of that.\n\n224\n00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:39.109\nAll right, what do we have there?\n\n225\n00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:42.360\nNumber 6, I believe or\nnumber 5 rather, excuse me.\n\n226\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.542\nHire professionals for\n\n227\n00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:46.920\nanalysis of evidence,\nif special skill sets are required.\n\n228\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.113\nIf you need somebody who is going to be\na firewall expert to help you unravel and\n\n229\n00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:54.809\nunwind firewalls right, and\nmaybe the logs associated with them.\n\n230\n00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:58.553\nIf you need somebody who is a data base\nexpert, who can help you understand what\n\n231\n00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:01.618\nthe structure of data is in the tables\ninvolved with data bases or\n\n232\n00:11:01.618 --> 00:11:03.890\nwhatever kind of data base you may have.\n\n233\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.926\nHierarchical, relational, so\nmany different kinds of databases.\n\n234\n00:11:06.926 --> 00:11:11.242\nObject oriented, whatever the case may be,\nyou need an expert that can tell you that.\n\n235\n00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:15.420\nIf you're looking at information in code,\nyou're reviewing malware.\n\n236\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.353\nYou're reviewing a program,\nlooking for malware and modifications.\n\n237\n00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:22.850\nMaybe it's a polymorphic virus or\npolymorphic malware that morphs and\n\n238\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.123\nliterally changes every\ntime it activates and\n\n239\n00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:27.720\nthat's what's been used\nto attack a system.\n\n240\n00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.760\nYou need an expert in malware design,\nan expert in malware forensics.\n\n241\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.609\nYou may not have that skill on staff, you\nmay have to go out and find that skill.\n\n242\n00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:37.755\nBy the way, Daniel is available, $24-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:38.393\n&gt;&gt; An hour, plus\n\n244\n00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:39.832\nall the food he can eat, right?\n\n245\n00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:40.526\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n246\n00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:43.097\n&gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind, but\nyou can hire him if you need him or\n\n247\n00:11:43.097 --> 00:11:44.745\nanybody who has those skills, right?\n\n248\n00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:49.123\nAll joking aside, and we have to keep in\nmind as forensics investigators that we're\n\n249\n00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:51.229\nnot gonna be experts about everything.\n\n250\n00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:54.468\nWe are gonna and should be\nexperts about the methodology and\n\n251\n00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:57.966\nwell trained and versed on how to\nengage in incident response and\n\n252\n00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.840\nspecifically computer forensics\nas part of incidence response.\n\n253\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.030\nBut that doesn't mean we are gonna be\nmasters of all or mistresses of all.\n\n254\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.990\nWe have to understand that there are gonna\nbe areas of knowledge where we may need\n\n255\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.440\nto call on expertise.\n\n256\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.267\nAnd the smartest security professionals\nout there are the people that understand\n\n257\n00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.441\ntheir own limitations.\n\n258\n00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:19.821\nAnd will partner in order to solve crimes,\nfigure out concerns, identify problems by\n\n259\n00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.520\nbringing in experts that are gonna\nbe able to help them to do that.\n\n260\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.470\nNo shame in asking for help, but\n\n261\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.802\na lot of shame associated\nwith essentially guessing.\n\n262\n00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:30.390\nAnd thinking you can do it and\ngetting it wrong,\n\n263\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.570\nbecause you just don't\nunderstand how to do it well.\n\n264\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.953\nAnd that is an important\nlesson you have to learn,\n\n265\n00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:38.318\nhopefully one you learn before it\nbecomes important in a court of law.\n\n266\n00:12:38.318 --> 00:12:39.811\ncuz you don't wanna be\nput in that position,\n\n267\n00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:41.370\nthat would never be a good outcome.\n\n268\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.684\nNumber six, evidence should be\nstrictly related to the incident.\n\n269\n00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:48.342\nYou may gather a lot of evidence, but\nif it's not portent to the case at hand,\n\n270\n00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:51.174\nit's not appropriate for\nthe scope of the investigation.\n\n271\n00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:55.021\nWhat is in is equally important is what is\nout, and we have to make sure we focus and\n\n272\n00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:56.440\nfilter accordingly.\n\n273\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.040\nEvidence should comply with\nall jurisdictional standards.\n\n274\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.070\nWe talked a little bit in a prior episode\nabout the focus of the appropriate law and\n\n275\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.695\na body of law rolled into a country or\na jurisdiction whatever that may be.\n\n276\n00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:12.000\nEvery country have its own slightly\ndifferent interpretation and\n\n277\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.950\nset of rules associated with how laws\nare applied as a security professional,\n\n278\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.480\nanyone in the world,\ndoing any kind of security work today.\n\n279\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.132\nYou must be aware of this,\nif you work in let's say,\n\n280\n00:13:23.132 --> 00:13:26.203\nCanada versus perhaps the European Union,\n\n281\n00:13:26.203 --> 00:13:31.525\nperhaps versus Mexico and/or Brazil or\nin, I don't know, Saudi Arabia.\n\n282\n00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:33.850\nOr anywhere in the world,\npick a country, doesn't matter where.\n\n283\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.101\nWhere do you want to go today, right?\n\n284\n00:13:35.101 --> 00:13:37.760\nWould be the question, wherever it is,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n285\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.480\nEvery one of those countries has their own\nset of laws many similarities country to\n\n286\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.300\ncountry in all the ones named about those\nlaws, but also a lot of differences.\n\n287\n00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.360\nAnd if you're doing business in\nthose areas as a business overall.\n\n288\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.099\nHopefully if you're smart enough,\n\n289\n00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:57.090\nare retaining legal counsel local to those\nareas that understand the intricacies.\n\n290\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.418\nAnd the importance of the interpretation\nof that law according to\n\n291\n00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:03.080\nthe jurisdictional requirements available.\n\n292\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.441\nAnd applied to you locally.\n\n293\n00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:08.721\nAnd as a security professional you\nmust adhede, I'm creating new words.\n\n294\n00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:10.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You must adhere to or\n\n295\n00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:14.200\nheed the advice of legal counsel and\nor seek out that counsel.\n\n296\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.430\nIn other words, again play to your\nstrengths but understand your weaknesses.\n\n297\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.424\nIf you're not a lawyer who understands the\nlaw of the land, quote unquote, in Israel,\n\n298\n00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:27.370\nin France, in Germany, in Switzerland,\nin Saudi Arabia, in anywhere in the world.\n\n299\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.271\nThen you need to get advice from somebody\nwho can authoritatively tell you what that\n\n300\n00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:34.950\nlaw would be and how you should respond.\n\n301\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.020\nWhat you don't wanna do is\nassumed that the laws of\n\n302\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.270\nCanada are gonna apply to I don't know,\nSouth Africa, right?\n\n303\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.274\nBecause that's most likely\nnot gonna be the case, or\n\n304\n00:14:46.274 --> 00:14:50.960\nthe laws of Mexico applying to let's say,\nI don't know perhaps Iceland, right?\n\n305\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.402\nI mean to potentially very\ndifferent legal systems,\n\n306\n00:14:53.402 --> 00:14:55.146\nthere gonna have different focuses.\n\n307\n00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:58.774\nAnd you need to make sure that you're\nwell versed in the appropriate law and\n\n308\n00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:02.980\nthe appropriate interpretation of that law\nbased on the jurisdiction you're gonna be\n\n309\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.980\noperating in.\n\n310\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.935\nThis becomes an incredibly complicating\nfactor when we start talking about cloud\n\n311\n00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:09.606\nbased environment for instance.\n\n312\n00:15:09.606 --> 00:15:14.069\nAnd forensics in the cloud, because\nwe have to worry about jurisdiction\n\n313\n00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:16.932\nbased on geographic preference for\nhosting.\n\n314\n00:15:16.932 --> 00:15:21.032\nWhere is the data located, really tells us\nwhat the jurisdiction involved with that\n\n315\n00:15:21.032 --> 00:15:24.150\ndata, and therefore the laws\napplied to that data will be.\n\n316\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.670\nYou may be a company in other words,\nbased in France.\n\n317\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.118\nBut if your data center\nis based in Canada,\n\n318\n00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:33.072\nyour data is being governed by laws\nin Canada, not by laws in France.\n\n319\n00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:36.686\nAnd you have to understand that, and\nas a result as a security professional,\n\n320\n00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.308\nyou have to operate accordingly.\n\n321\n00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:41.126\nIt's very important thing that we\nhave to keep coming back to and\n\n322\n00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:42.310\nreminding ourselves of.\n\n323\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.832\nDocument the procedure or\nprocedures applied for all evidence.\n\n324\n00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:49.037\nAgain very detailed,\nmeticulous notes and understanding and\n\n325\n00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:50.982\ndocumentation of everything you do.\n\n326\n00:15:50.982 --> 00:15:54.622\nWe talked about evidence logs,\nwe talked about chain of custody logs.\n\n327\n00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:57.830\nThese are things that become important\nSecurely store all evidence.\n\n328\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.456\nWhat we don't wanna have and\n\n329\n00:15:59.456 --> 00:16:02.840\nfind is that evidence is not\ngonna be under lock and key.\n\n330\n00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.960\nBut it must also be kept in\nclimate controlled environments,\n\n331\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.310\nappropriate to the nature of the evidence.\n\n332\n00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.030\nIf you have a computer for instance and\nthat computer is powered down and stored,\n\n333\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:17.050\nit could be stored in a relatively\nstable climatized environment.\n\n334\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.610\nProbably no damage will occur but\nif you store in environments very wet and\n\n335\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.540\nhumid the electronics\ninside may become damaged.\n\n336\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.460\nIf you store in an area\nthat's very high in dust, for\n\n337\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.380\ninstance a lot of particulate matter\nin the air, you may actually run into\n\n338\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.850\na problem where you go to start that\nsystem up, there may be a lot of\n\n339\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.400\nissues with the running of that system\nbecause it could have been damaged.\n\n340\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.870\nAgain these are things to consider.\n\n341\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.420\nYou can't put electronics in there\nwhere's there's a lot of smoke.\n\n342\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.930\nSmoke is highly corrosive to\nthe internal circuitry of computers.\n\n343\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.880\nThis is why they don't let you smoke\nin data centers and in radio stations.\n\n344\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Anymore\n&gt;&gt; Anymore.\n\n345\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.810\nThat's just what I was gonna say.\n\n346\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.626\nWhen I was coming up boy that was the,\n\n347\n00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:54.130\nexception was that you didn't smoke,\nright.\n\n348\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.140\n&gt;&gt; And they're like hes the weirdo?\n\n349\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.060\n&gt;&gt; But yeah the exception was\nthat most people did not.\n\n350\n00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.200\nYou don't necessarily choose to smoke\nall the time, but a lot of people did.\n\n351\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.380\nAnd for years, when I worked.\n\n352\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.870\nI came up in music business and radio,\nyears and years ago, my other life\n\n353\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:13.260\nbefore I became a normal business\nlooking professional that I am today.\n\n354\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.060\nBut back in my former life,\nI was in the music business.\n\n355\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.300\nI was in radio for a long time,\nand that was the norm.\n\n356\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.770\nIn data centers back in the day,\nyou used to be able to smoke at one point.\n\n357\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.310\nYou don't anymore for a lot of reasons.\n\n358\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.460\nBut this is one of them.\n\n359\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.200\nBecause you damage the electronics.\n\n360\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.930\nSmoke is corrosive, it binds to\neverything and it literally is like acid.\n\n361\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.390\nIt eats away, not just at you but\ninside the computer as well.\n\n362\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.295\nSo it's very, very bad for\nlots and lots and lots of reasons.\n\n363\n00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:41.384\nAnd also number ten on that list,\nuse recognize tools and the appropriate,\n\n364\n00:17:41.384 --> 00:17:43.515\nrecognize the inappropriate tools,\nI should say.\n\n365\n00:17:43.515 --> 00:17:47.591\nFor analysis meaning, if we had a choice\nof tools that are gonna be appropriates,\n\n366\n00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:48.615\nget the job done.\n\n367\n00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:51.065\nWe gotta make sure we go choose\nthe ones that are best suited.\n\n368\n00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:53.195\nThat's not to say we\ncan't have preferences.\n\n369\n00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:57.025\nNot to say that we cannot focus on\ncertain tools that we like and or\n\n370\n00:17:57.025 --> 00:17:58.455\nhave the ability to use better.\n\n371\n00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:01.720\nWe may be more of a Windows versus\na Linux person, or vice versa.\n\n372\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.310\nWe have that conversation on\na regular basis Daniel and\n\n373\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.290\nI, Daniel has a preference for although he\nworks equally well in both environments.\n\n374\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.440\nHis preference is to be on\na non Microsoft environment for\n\n375\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.460\na lot of the stuff he does.\n\n376\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.235\nMy preference is, I could care less,\n\n377\n00:18:15.235 --> 00:18:17.885\nI could operate in any environment,\nit doesn't matter to me.\n\n378\n00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:20.645\nI have to based on the nature\nof what I do for a living but\n\n379\n00:18:20.645 --> 00:18:21.585\nyou may have a preference.\n\n380\n00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:23.945\nSo choose tools that\nare appropriate to that but\n\n381\n00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:27.062\nkeep in mind that not every tool\nwill do the job the same way.\n\n382\n00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.312\nAnd not every tool is appropriate for\nevery environment.\n\n383\n00:18:29.312 --> 00:18:31.172\nIf you're dealing with a Windows system,\n\n384\n00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:34.122\nright, you need tools that will\nrun in a Windows environment.\n\n385\n00:18:34.122 --> 00:18:37.342\nDealing with a Macintosh, or\nan Apple, or a Cisco platform, or\n\n386\n00:18:37.342 --> 00:18:39.652\nwhatever, you need tools\nappropriate to that.\n\n387\n00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:41.292\nSo it is very important,\nto understand that.\n\n388\n00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:42.612\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Adam, I have a quick question.\n\n389\n00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:44.122\nYou're speaking about tools and\n\n390\n00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:47.212\nthe appropriateness of them,\nand the recognition of them.\n\n391\n00:18:47.212 --> 00:18:52.410\nDo courts or legal systems,\nin your experience,\n\n392\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.630\ndo they tend to recognize\ncertain software suites,\n\n393\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.280\nforensic tools, specific forensic tools,\nnot necessarily operating systems, but\n\n394\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.790\ntools themselves as more\nlegitimate than others.\n\n395\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.760\nOr would you have to like beg the case of,\n\n396\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.440\nthis is a legitimate\nforensic tool sometimes?\n\n397\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.610\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually a really,\nreally great question.\n\n398\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.480\nMuch, much more insightful than you\nmay realize just listening to us talk.\n\n399\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.770\nAnd Daniel's point is incredibly\nimportant for the following reason.\n\n400\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.100\nWe talk a lot about standards,\n\n401\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.290\nabout legal requirements, things like\nthat, and you would think logically,\n\n402\n00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.930\nhey so maybe there are certain\ntools that would be recommended.\n\n403\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.270\nRight, as you were suggesting,\nmaybe standardized in a tool kit.\n\n404\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.840\nTraditionally, quite the opposite.\n\n405\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.190\nWhat we really tend to focus on is\nthe credentials of the investigator, or\n\n406\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.850\nthe person who may be\npresenting the evidence.\n\n407\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.710\nHypothetically, let's just say\nperhaps in our example that was you.\n\n408\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.470\nIf you were presenting evidence as\nan investigator who had done the work.\n\n409\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.880\nWhile we may question you about\nthe methodology, how did you do this?\n\n410\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.210\nHow did you gather the evidence?\n\n411\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.020\nDid you do this, this, or this?\n\n412\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.620\nAnd we may say what tools did you use?\n\n413\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.649\nWe're not gonna say,\n\n414\n00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:59.201\nDaniel used a screwdriver when\nhe should have used a for iron.\n\n415\n00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:01.750\nWell bad form, right?\n\n416\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.340\nTisk, tisk.\n\n417\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.770\nWe're not gonna allow you to\nactually present information.\n\n418\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.664\nThe burden of proof and the onus is on the\ncredential and the validation of not only\n\n419\n00:20:10.664 --> 00:20:15.074\nthe credential meaning the skills, if you\nwill, of the person, the investigator\n\n420\n00:20:15.074 --> 00:20:19.618\ntraditionally more often than not, that\nis being cross-examined or is testified.\n\n421\n00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:24.481\nBut on the actual methodology as opposed\nto the specifics of a tool because\n\n422\n00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:29.440\nas you know, all of you know,\ncertainly Daniel you know, we all know.\n\n423\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.200\nIf you do this for\na living or, in general,\n\n424\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.870\nif you just do computer\nwork as an IT professional.\n\n425\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:34.630\nIf you do security,\n\n426\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.760\nin particular, you know how quickly\nthings change in our world today.\n\n427\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.060\nEven more so\nnow than any time in the past.\n\n428\n00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.290\nThere's always a new tool,\nalways a new technique.\n\n429\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.075\nWhile there are some special cases and\n\n430\n00:20:44.075 --> 00:20:47.981\nrare cases where if you're using something\nhighly controversial as an approach,\n\n431\n00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:50.453\na technique, or a tool, and\nthet may come to light.\n\n432\n00:20:50.453 --> 00:20:53.680\nA good defense lawyer,\na good prosecutor may figure that out and\n\n433\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.650\nmay call you on it.\n\n434\n00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.310\nAnd you may then have to\ndefend that methodology.\n\n435\n00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.120\nThis is not what you may see in\na lot of those crime dramas where\n\n436\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.450\nthey put the psychologist on the stand and\nthey say, hey,\n\n437\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.590\nwere you able to reach\ninto that kid's brain and\n\n438\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.570\npull that out and definitively say yes or\nno, if they are or not, this or that?\n\n439\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.160\nWell, we have studies that show.\n\n440\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.890\nYeah, but there's all these other\nstudies that show you don't.\n\n441\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.470\nWe're not talking about something that's\nreally gray, this is a fairly black and\n\n442\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.960\nwhite conversation.\n\n443\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.690\nIf you use established methodologies and\ntherefore establish procedures\n\n444\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.230\nthat have been more or\nless passed on over the years and\n\n445\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.830\neverybody has agreed this is the way to\ndo it from a standardization perspective.\n\n446\n00:21:33.905 --> 00:21:35.385\nThose rules are followed.\n\n447\n00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:39.485\nThe tool set, while it's important,\nI don't wanna minimize the idea, it's not\n\n448\n00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:43.215\nthe critical pivot-point or component for\nus that we will traditionally focus on.\n\n449\n00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:46.335\nSo while there are definitely\nare tools you would wanna use, right?\n\n450\n00:21:46.335 --> 00:21:49.065\nWe would often think of,\nand you hear for instance,\n\n451\n00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:54.765\nkinda the Rolls Royce of digital forensics\ncase management tool sets EnCase, right?\n\n452\n00:21:54.765 --> 00:21:56.600\nThat's the one you often hear\nabout that everybody uses.\n\n453\n00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.800\nAnd we'll talk about that at some\npoint in upcoming conversations.\n\n454\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.760\nBut there's many other platforms\nbesides EnCase that can be used.\n\n455\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.650\nEncase is a world famous tool, but\nnot the only one that does what it does.\n\n456\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.760\nThere's tools on the Linux platform that\ncan be used very effectively as well.\n\n457\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.930\nAnd so it's really in some respects viewer\nchoice but in many respects the most\n\n458\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.970\nimportant thing is to use, you don't wanna\nbe using off-in-the-corner crazy tools\n\n459\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.940\nthat nobody's heard of, because you open\nyourself up potentially to then having to\n\n460\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.900\nwalk through the technical and\nthe technicality conversations about\n\n461\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.700\nwhether it was a tool that would or\nwould not work the right way.\n\n462\n00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.710\nAnd you wanna avoid those land mines,\nand that minefield.\n\n463\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.710\nBut there are certain kinds of recovery\nefforts that are undertaken where you have\n\n464\n00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.020\nto use highly specialized tools that\nare not in the standard tool kit or\n\n465\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.300\nthe norm because of the nature\nof the work being done.\n\n466\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.920\nForensics investigation of remnant data\non a hard drive that's been damaged.\n\n467\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.840\nThink of something like a black box that\nyou're trying to pull data off of after\n\n468\n00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.820\na crash, literally right,\nsomething like that.\n\n469\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.910\nThere are established tool sets and\nmechanisms to do that.\n\n470\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.660\nAnd there's a very specific\nmethodology associated with that.\n\n471\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.840\nBut translate that into a computer\nas opposed to a crash where you're\n\n472\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.620\ntrying to read a black box.\n\n473\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.830\nTake a hard drive out, it's been damaged.\n\n474\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.720\nMaybe somebody ran it through some sort\nof process to purposely hide the data and\n\n475\n00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.050\ntry to etch the plotters\nthrough all sort of stuff.\n\n476\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.080\nYou may have to call in highly\nspecialized experts to do this work.\n\n477\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.830\nThe tools they use are gonna be unique to\ntheir specific set of skills in their part\n\n478\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.440\nof the industry, but\nthey're established for their use.\n\n479\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.120\nAs long as you establish those\ncredential of those people,\n\n480\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.120\npretty much without exception,\nthen the conversation is,\n\n481\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.740\nwere they methodologically\ncorrect in their approach?\n\n482\n00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.824\nAs long as they can validate that, they\nestablish and maintain chain of custody,\n\n483\n00:23:41.824 --> 00:23:46.084\nnobody's gonna question you on, hey,\nthe data extract from 2000 was used, and\n\n484\n00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:47.112\nhow does that work?\n\n485\n00:23:47.112 --> 00:23:49.687\nIt says here in the owner's manual on\npage 3 that if you didn't do this,\n\n486\n00:23:49.687 --> 00:23:50.659\nnobody's gonna ask that,\n\n487\n00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:52.148\nit's just not something to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n488\n00:23:52.148 --> 00:23:56.554\nyour credentials as an expert witness Lend\ncredence to whatever you tool you used.\n\n489\n00:23:56.554 --> 00:24:00.435\n&gt;&gt; Your credentials as well as your\nability to prove that you followed the\n\n490\n00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:01.271\n&gt;&gt; The methodology.\n\n491\n00:24:01.271 --> 00:24:02.226\n&gt;&gt; Methodology\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n492\n00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:04.320\n&gt;&gt; And created and\nmaintained the chain of custody for\n\n493\n00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.510\nhandling that evidence throughout all\nthe investigatory process Sees that you\n\n494\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.540\nare then speaking knowledgeably about\nwhen you're offering testimony.\n\n495\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.540\nThat's really where we really focus.\n\n496\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.120\nThat's the primary focal point and\n\n497\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.060\nthe necessity of what we have\nto validate when we do this.\n\n498\n00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.870\nAll right, so\ntoo that it's a great question by the way.\n\n499\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.620\nIt's a very, very good question.\n\n500\n00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.110\nSo one other thing we want to point out,\nas we wrap up our conversation here.\n\n501\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.170\nSo building on this idea\nof the thought process and\n\n502\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.590\nthe rules that we follow, we have a\nmethodology that we develop, as a result.\n\n503\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.450\nYou've been hearing me\nrefer to this methodology,\n\n504\n00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.210\nlet's take a look at what it looks like,\nquickly.\n\n505\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.470\nJust to put it out there for us,\nwe'll return back to it in other shows,\n\n506\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.950\nand continue to refer to it.\n\n507\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.470\nBut the magic finger needs\na little there we go.\n\n508\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.290\nLittle I'm hitting the magic\nbutton you don't see.\n\n509\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.086\nIt's right below camera.\n\n510\n00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:48.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's also because it's\n\n511\n00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.230\nthis massive button right here.\n\n512\n00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.728\nIt's got Taylor's name\non it when I press it.\n\n513\n00:24:51.728 --> 00:24:52.584\n&gt;&gt; Blinking yeah it's awesome.\n\n514\n00:24:52.584 --> 00:24:54.290\n&gt;&gt; It blink's and\nall the sudden it's eyes spin around,\n\n515\n00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.273\nthey light up and look at that.\n\n516\n00:24:55.273 --> 00:24:56.245\n&gt;&gt; We actually get that.\n\n517\n00:24:56.245 --> 00:24:59.735\nSo thank you very much for putting\nthat up, sir, I do appreciate that.\n\n518\n00:24:59.735 --> 00:25:01.825\nCyber crime investigation\nmethodology in step.\n\n519\n00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:06.685\nSo, what is the methodology we develop\nby going through this thought process?\n\n520\n00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:09.165\nWell, we can extrapolate again into\n\n521\n00:25:09.165 --> 00:25:11.535\na series of steps that seem to make sense,\nright?\n\n522\n00:25:11.535 --> 00:25:15.283\nSo, identify the crime,\ninvolve the computer crime specifically,\n\n523\n00:25:15.283 --> 00:25:19.603\nwhat are we going to focus on, collect\nwhat we would call preliminary evidence do\n\n524\n00:25:19.603 --> 00:25:23.178\nan initial investigatory,\nlook around, see what's out there.\n\n525\n00:25:23.178 --> 00:25:27.232\nNever touch anything, never pick\nanything up, never take anything but\n\n526\n00:25:27.232 --> 00:25:30.100\nwe wanna be able to start\nforming a better picture.\n\n527\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.820\nOne of the things that's\nbeen going on more and\n\n528\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.867\nmore today this new technology really\nbeing brought to the form, and\n\n529\n00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:40.510\nreally coming into investigatory\nprocesses like these.\n\n530\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.325\nYou see it more in actual crime\nscenes where there are bodies,\n\n531\n00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:45.942\nas opposed to something like\nwe were talking about here.\n\n532\n00:25:45.942 --> 00:25:48.300\nBut they're using 3D mapping now.\n\n533\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.343\nSo they're brining in 3D cameras\nessentially much like they would do\n\n534\n00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:54.680\nto create a 3D map and do these layouts.\n\n535\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.841\nAnd they are doing this in the round\nphotography of the crime scene.\n\n536\n00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:01.375\nOnce they investigate everything they\nput all the little tents out with all\n\n537\n00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:05.540\nthe evidence numbers and all that and they\nwill literally take all these pictures.\n\n538\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.730\nThey snap a picture in the rotating\ncamera all the way around,\n\n539\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.950\ncreate a 360 panorama of the crime scene.\n\n540\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.280\nThey reproduce that using computers, and\nthen at trial they can bring this up.\n\n541\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.040\nAnd actually show you, and walk through,\nand examine, and understand, and question.\n\n542\n00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.740\nBased on being able to see the crime\nscene, an actual reproduction.\n\n543\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.970\nThat's forensically sound right.\n\n544\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.460\nSo, they obviously validate that\neverything is the way it is.\n\n545\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.200\nBut they're actually able to\nreproduce this stuff now.\n\n546\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.260\nIt's a pretty interesting technology,\ncuz for years you know you see renderings,\n\n547\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.880\nyou see drawings,\nyou see computer animations, but\n\n548\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.520\nthey're not as approximate as the actual\ncrime scene this gives us essentially\n\n549\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.510\nthe ability to walk through in virtual\nreality which is kind of interesting.\n\n550\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.750\n&gt;&gt; That is very cool.\n\n551\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.490\n&gt;&gt; It's not as appropriate to what we're\ndoing with computers and digital forensics\n\n552\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.290\nin terms of computer crime specifically\n&gt;&gt; Physical crimes.\n\n553\n00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, for stuff like a physical crime,\nwhere you have a body\n\n554\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Been a break in or\n\n555\n00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.590\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n556\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can reproduce the exact evidence as\n\n557\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:02.410\nit appears and then give both prosecution\nand defense the ability to then\n\n558\n00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.690\npresent their side of the story,\ntheir version of events, if you will.\n\n559\n00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.190\nWith some really startling results in\nterms of being able to see it first hand.\n\n560\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.360\nSo it is kind of cool.\n\n561\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.130\nI'm waiting for\nthe Disney ride to come out.\n\n562\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.270\nRight? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n563\n00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.730\nGo on a forensics ride.\n\n564\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.230\n&gt;&gt; That would be kinda cool right?\n\n565\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.170\nSo anyway if we go back to our list,\ncollect preliminary evidence as you saw.\n\n566\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.190\nObtain court warrants, meaning a search\nwarrant of some kind right for\n\n567\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.680\ndiscovery seizure of evidence.\n\n568\n00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.200\nIf required I put that\nin parentheses here and\n\n569\n00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.840\nalso down at the bottom because you may or\nmay not need a search warrant or\n\n570\n00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.780\npermission from the court\nto do certain things.\n\n571\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.300\nIf this is an internal\ninvestigation inside of a company,\n\n572\n00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.400\nan administrative action if you will.\n\n573\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.570\nAnd somebody has been accused of\nsomething, you think maybe somebody\n\n574\n00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.510\nengaged in some insider threats or\nattacks against the file server, whatever.\n\n575\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.190\nYou may not have to go and\ninvolve a court of law.\n\n576\n00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.200\nYou may just simply because\nof the expectation, or\n\n577\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.240\nin this case the lack thereof of privacy\nwhen you operate on internal networks.\n\n578\n00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.700\nIn a company, assuming there is\nthe appropriate policy supporting place.\n\n579\n00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.240\nYou may as a representative of the IT or\nthe administrative or friends of function.\n\n580\n00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.830\nWhatever it is, you have the right as long\nthe senior management approves it for\n\n581\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.500\nyou to go in and\ndo whatever investigation you need.\n\n582\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.040\nSees whatever evidence and\n\n583\n00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.580\nfaults you may need without\nhaving to get a search warrant.\n\n584\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.850\nBut what you're getting is permission\nfrom the appropriate authorities.\n\n585\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.630\nAnd that's generically,\nthe broad category we think about here.\n\n586\n00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:26.050\nPerform first responder procedures,\nwhatever those might be.\n\n587\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:31.540\nSeize evidence at the crime scene,\ntransport evidence to the secure analysis\n\n588\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.010\nfacility, we traditionally call that\na forensics lab but whatever that may be.\n\n589\n00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.240\nYou may be doing this in the field,\n\n590\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.610\nyou may not have the ability to examine\nthe evidence in a formal forensics lab.\n\n591\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.815\nYou may be taking it\nback to the IT office.\n\n592\n00:28:42.815 --> 00:28:45.415\nAnd examining somebody's laptop right,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n593\n00:28:45.415 --> 00:28:48.056\nJust whatever it is,\nyou do it in a forensically sound and\n\n594\n00:28:48.056 --> 00:28:50.586\nin a way that allows us to not\nonly preserve evidence but\n\n595\n00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:53.304\nto also maintain chain of custody,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n596\n00:28:53.304 --> 00:28:56.133\nCreate 2-bit stream\ncopies of the evidence.\n\n597\n00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:59.037\nThe concept of the bitstream copy\nis a straightforward idea but\n\n598\n00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.615\none that's incredibly important and\nfoundational for\n\n599\n00:29:01.615 --> 00:29:04.700\nwhen we talk about with regards\nto forensic investigation.\n\n600\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.369\nWe will create as we talked about in\nthe last episode where I talked about\n\n601\n00:29:08.369 --> 00:29:12.420\nexporting the output of the display DNS\nparameter for IP config to a text file.\n\n602\n00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.816\nAnd said, look I did that locally but\nnow I've modified the drive,\n\n603\n00:29:15.816 --> 00:29:18.570\nnot forensically sound,how\nwe do that the right way?\n\n604\n00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.536\nWe do that by using an export capability\nto an external device using write blocker\n\n605\n00:29:23.536 --> 00:29:28.150\nto prevent backfill or writing and\nmodifying of the original data source.\n\n606\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.800\nWe talked through the logic of that.\n\n607\n00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.180\nBit stream copies that\nare forensically sound are made of all\n\n608\n00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.060\nevidence that's electronic, so hard\ndrives, files, whatever the case may be.\n\n609\n00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.330\nThat's a standard practice, but\nagain, we do that by doing software,\n\n610\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.940\ncloning software,\ncopying software, whatever it is.\n\n611\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.530\nI mentioned, I think,\nthe Linux tool DD in the last episode,\n\n612\n00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.480\nthat's a tool that could\nbe used to do this.\n\n613\n00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.840\nDrive Image Pro, there's all these\ndifferent tools that exist out there.\n\n614\n00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.640\nWhatever you use, there are forensically\nsound software packages.\n\n615\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.690\nThat allow you to create a copy without\nmodifying any data on the original, but\n\n616\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.750\nagain pair that with a write blocker so\nthat you enable the copy to be created\n\n617\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.690\nsomewhere wherever it is and you're not\nin any way gonna modify the original.\n\n618\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.080\nThat's what we have to do and\n\n619\n00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.260\nthen we hash those bit stream copies to\ncreate an integrity validation point for\n\n620\n00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.960\nus, so that way we can tell whether those\ncopies have been modified in any way.\n\n621\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.950\nWe hash the original source.\n\n622\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.720\nWe hash the copies, compare the two.\n\n623\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.040\nAnd if the hashes match, we know\nthe source and the copy are identical.\n\n624\n00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.210\nWe then we do the analysis on the copy,\n\n625\n00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.710\nleaving the original intact for reference\npurposes and to evaluate if we have to.\n\n626\n00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.150\nAnd step 14 down there testify for\nany reason.\n\n627\n00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.830\nWe know we can validate\nthe information where it came from and\n\n628\n00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.050\nthe information contained within it.\n\n629\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.790\nAnd by doing that and\nat certain key points comparing the two,\n\n630\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:53.210\nyou maintain our chains of\ncustody in steps eight and nine.\n\n631\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.830\nWhether we use MD5 to use a check sum,\nmessage digest,\n\n632\n00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.330\nShy1, Shy160 there's many\nhashing algorithms out there.\n\n633\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.450\nThe choice of the algorithm is not as\nimportant as using the methodology, and\n\n634\n00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.810\nimplementing the methodology based on\nwhatever the standard is that you used.\n\n635\n00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.560\nYour standard maybe that you use\na different hashing algorithm and\n\n636\n00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.500\nthat's fine.\n\n637\n00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.625\nBut you have to follow\nwhatever the standard is.\n\n638\n00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:18.065\nSo store the original evidence\nin a secure location.\n\n639\n00:31:18.065 --> 00:31:20.715\nAnalyze the image copies\nwe talked about in step 11.\n\n640\n00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:22.375\nPrepare your reports.\n\n641\n00:31:22.375 --> 00:31:24.705\nSubmit your reports to the client or\nwhoever,\n\n642\n00:31:24.705 --> 00:31:27.275\nwhatever is driving the investigation.\n\n643\n00:31:27.275 --> 00:31:31.855\nAnd again if required down in step 14,\nyou may be called to testify.\n\n644\n00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:35.455\nRemember again, a lot of these activities\noccur inside organizations and\n\n645\n00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:37.215\nnever see the inside of a courtroom.\n\n646\n00:31:37.215 --> 00:31:40.900\nNever see a form of criminal\nprocess being brought to bear.\n\n647\n00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.210\nBut rather informally,\n\n648\n00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.180\nyou're investigating malware\nbeing put into a system.\n\n649\n00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.600\nSome sort of hacking\nactivity that's internal.\n\n650\n00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.410\nYou figure that out, and\ninternally you take steps to prevent that,\n\n651\n00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.090\nbut you may not go to court over this.\n\n652\n00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.608\nSo it is gonna be relevant, right?\n\n653\n00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:56.212\nSo some of these steps may or\nmay not be required,\n\n654\n00:31:56.212 --> 00:31:57.596\nand that's why we labelled them as such.\n\n655\n00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:00.420\nJust wanna make sure you're\naware of that as well.\n\n656\n00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.274\nAll right, Adam.\nDefinitely a lot more covered that\n\n657\n00:32:03.274 --> 00:32:07.930\nmethodology was gonna be key to us\nlearning how to be effective and\n\n658\n00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.735\nefficient forensics investigators.\n\n659\n00:32:10.735 --> 00:32:15.380\nIts core to what we do as CHFIs, so make\nsure that you lock those in right here,\n\n660\n00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.097\nit's gotta go here, it's gotta be\n100% permanently embedded because as\n\n661\n00:32:20.097 --> 00:32:22.328\nwe've talked about before-\n&gt;&gt; Tattoos?\n\n662\n00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:23.855\n&gt;&gt; Yes, tattoos are always helpful.\n\n663\n00:32:23.855 --> 00:32:25.980\n[LAUGH] Just don't put them on your face.\n\n664\n00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.558\n&gt;&gt; Henna, henna.\n\n665\n00:32:27.558 --> 00:32:28.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, henna.\n\n666\n00:32:28.616 --> 00:32:29.509\nAll right, great stuff.\n\n667\n00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:32.610\nSo make sure you understand those and\nyou have them memorized so\n\n668\n00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.562\nthat you don't walk outside of those.\n\n669\n00:32:34.562 --> 00:32:39.080\nYou wanna follow proper methodology so\nthat you don't lose any credibility if and\n\n670\n00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.400\nwhen the case may come.\n\n671\n00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.380\nThat being said, Adam,\nI know we have more to cover so\n\n672\n00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.848\nwe're gonna have to\nroll into a part three.\n\n673\n00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:49.475\nAnd while we do that, before we do\nthat I'm gonna jump into Wikipedia and\n\n674\n00:32:49.475 --> 00:32:50.254\nadd an ad heed.\n\n675\n00:32:50.254 --> 00:32:51.908\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before we do that,\n\n676\n00:32:51.908 --> 00:32:52.969\ngive me a little more time.\n\n677\n00:32:52.969 --> 00:32:54.832\nI did, I just wanna,\nsince we were running at this particular-\n\n678\n00:32:54.832 --> 00:32:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Addendum.\n\n679\n00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.594\n&gt;&gt; An addendum.\n\n680\n00:32:56.594 --> 00:33:00.081\nSince we're having this particular\nconversation around the theory, the rules,\n\n681\n00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:01.420\nkind of the methodology.\n\n682\n00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.503\nThere's just one other thing\nI wanna throw out there.\n\n683\n00:33:02.503 --> 00:33:06.928\nIt's called the ETI,\nthe Enterprise Theory of Investigations or\n\n684\n00:33:06.928 --> 00:33:10.254\nhow we'll carry out\ncorporate investigations.\n\n685\n00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:15.688\nI was talking more theoretical,\nhey maybe this is internal.\n\n686\n00:33:15.688 --> 00:33:17.794\nThis is actually a theory or\nformal framework for that.\n\n687\n00:33:17.794 --> 00:33:20.648\nWe do call it ETI,\nthe Enterprise Theory of Investigations.\n\n688\n00:33:20.648 --> 00:33:24.442\nJust wanna throw that out there we\nwill investigate or derive that.\n\n689\n00:33:24.442 --> 00:33:26.401\nThe FBI actually has been behind this.\n\n690\n00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:30.596\nThey derive and think through the logic of\nhow do we investigate criminal activities,\n\n691\n00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:33.942\nbut not as one-off events, but\nrather looking at it holistically.\n\n692\n00:33:33.942 --> 00:33:38.439\nSo that we can try to encompass the entire\ncriminal organization that maybe behind\n\n693\n00:33:38.439 --> 00:33:42.545\nthe activity, looking to rule them up and\ntrying to get everybody involved\n\n694\n00:33:42.545 --> 00:33:46.350\nas opposed to seeing in there's\none off of them, that's isolated.\n\n695\n00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.512\nSo, hey Daniel broke in, but\nwe didn't really catch him, and so\n\n696\n00:33:49.512 --> 00:33:53.134\nmaybe we do it and prosecute Daniel,\nbut Daniel was doing at the behest of,\n\n697\n00:33:53.134 --> 00:33:54.819\nyou're the evil genius, right?\n\n698\n00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:56.439\nFor starting the whole\ncriminal enterprise.\n\n699\n00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:59.583\nAnd so this idea of not seeing\nthings as a single act,\n\n700\n00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:02.720\nbut rather part of a conspiracy or\na bigger whole.\n\n701\n00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.384\n&gt;&gt; So like organized crime kind of thing.\n\n702\n00:34:04.384 --> 00:34:08.377\n&gt;&gt; It's specific, yeah, it's really\nspecific to the criminal enterprise that\n\n703\n00:34:08.377 --> 00:34:12.750\nis gonna be racketeering, and engaging in\nthings like that at that criminal level.\n\n704\n00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:17.552\nIt's not specific per se, to us in\nthe CFI CHFI kind of environment, but\n\n705\n00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:21.959\nthe idea is still there, that we\nwant to take from that not so much,\n\n706\n00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:25.504\nhey every activity they have\na conspiracy behind it,\n\n707\n00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:29.011\nbut we wanna be looking for\ncausality and linkages.\n\n708\n00:34:29.011 --> 00:34:32.998\nAnd that's really what ETI helps us to\nthink about in this sphere, the fact that\n\n709\n00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:37.790\nwhen we look at a single, one-off instance\nof a computer being breached with malware.\n\n710\n00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:42.393\nWas it really just a one-off event, or was\nthere some sort of broader agenda behind\n\n711\n00:34:42.393 --> 00:34:44.707\nit, where maybe we have been taken over?\n\n712\n00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:47.249\nThere's now some sort of back channel or\ncommand and\n\n713\n00:34:47.249 --> 00:34:51.080\ncontrol environment that's been\nestablished as a beachhead in our network.\n\n714\n00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.961\nAnd there's an enterprise that's\nlooking to gain control and\n\n715\n00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:56.090\nleverage that to engage\nin other activities.\n\n716\n00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.828\nAnd as a first responder, as a forensic\ninvestigator It will be our job to try to\n\n717\n00:34:59.828 --> 00:35:02.106\nput those pieces together and\nfigure that out.\n\n718\n00:35:02.106 --> 00:35:05.750\nAnd ETI, as a framework, helps us\nto broaden our thought process, and\n\n719\n00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.691\nsee the forest,\nas well as seeing the individual trees.\n\n720\n00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.940\nIf you think about the logical.\n\n721\n00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.781\nSo just wanted to throw that out there for\nus as we wrap up,\n\n722\n00:35:12.781 --> 00:35:15.979\nkind of putting that in with all\nthe other stuff in this episode,\n\n723\n00:35:15.979 --> 00:35:20.153\nallowing us to just put that general idea\nand thought process there to close us out.\n\n724\n00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:21.027\nThat was my addendum.\n\n725\n00:35:21.027 --> 00:35:23.555\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was a good one cuz it\njust goes to show you how many\n\n726\n00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:26.785\ndifferent facets there are to being\na digital forensics investigator.\n\n727\n00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:29.586\nSo that being said,\nwe got more to talk about.\n\n728\n00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:31.115\nWe're gonna come back for a part three.\n\n729\n00:35:31.115 --> 00:35:32.062\nDefinitely join us for that.\n\n730\n00:35:32.062 --> 00:35:35.063\nAdam, thank you so much for\nwhat you've shown us thus far.\n\n731\n00:35:35.063 --> 00:35:37.275\nWe look forward to continuing\nthis journey with you.\n\n732\n00:35:37.275 --> 00:35:39.390\nThat being said, thank you guys for\nwatching as well.\n\n733\n00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.216\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n734\n00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:44.674\n&gt;&gt; Look, I almost got to be\ntall as you for a second.\n\n735\n00:35:44.674 --> 00:35:47.640\nI am Adam Gordon, shorter but\nstill very relevant.\n\n736\n00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.614\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n737\n00:35:48.614 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:13.868\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:18.520\nwelcome back to another great episode of\nITProTV, hi I'm you host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.140\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\nnow with more on our CHFI series and\n\n7\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.480\nVersion 9 for those of you paying\nattention to the versioning.\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.885\nJoining us in the studio,\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon,\n\n9\n00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:31.102\nAdam we're good to have you again,\nhow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well, glad to be\nback and continuing our conversation with\n\n11\n00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.209\nregards to the state of\nforensics in the modern world.\n\n12\n00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.939\nToday's world, whatever kind of world\nyou're in at any point of time,\n\n13\n00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:42.860\nwherever you are, whatever you wanna do.\n\n14\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.200\nSo we wanna jump back in and\n\n15\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.470\nhave a conversation continuing this theme\naround where we are today with forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.360\nThe groundwork of what we need to do\nto understand how we're going to then\n\n17\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.736\nbuild on that knowledge as we go\nthrough some additional topic areas.\n\n18\n00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:56.460\nWe were talking just\nbefore we came back for\n\n19\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.390\nthis episode, about the concept\nof the exchange principles.\n\n20\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.656\nSpecifically, I'm gonna let you name\nthis because of our little discussion.\n\n21\n00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:07.160\nIt's not picards that exchange\nthe principle but rather,\n\n22\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.445\nlocard's that exchange principle,\nnot Captain Picard but Mr Locard.\n\n23\n00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:13.654\nSo Locard's exchange principle,\n\n24\n00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:17.740\nvery important concept that we\nuse to discuss and understand.\n\n25\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.530\nThe mindset,\n\n26\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.420\nthe methodology of the bad actor when\nit comes to forensic examination.\n\n27\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.080\nThe idea of Locard's principle of\nexchange or Locard's exchange principle\n\n28\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.189\nis the idea that you take something but\nyou also leave something.\n\n29\n00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.839\nWhen we investigate a crime the criminal\nactor will leave things behind as\n\n30\n00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:34.593\nevidence.\n\n31\n00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:37.967\nClues, that if we are attuned to them and\nunderstand them,\n\n32\n00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.270\nwill help us to identify who they are and\nwhat they did.\n\n33\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.537\nBut they also will remove things from\nthe crime scene, in other words,\n\n34\n00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.377\nthey will typically break in in\norder to gain some advantage.\n\n35\n00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:50.200\nSteal some evidence,\nrather leave evidence behind, but\n\n36\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.390\nsteal something in return or remove it.\n\n37\n00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.040\nAnd so if we focus on the idea\nof what is missing and\n\n38\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.975\nwhat is added and we understand then as\na result, the changes that have occurred.\n\n39\n00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.495\nLocard figured out that from\na criminalistic perspective this will help\n\n40\n00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:07.397\nus to identify potentially,\nthe bad actors.\n\n41\n00:02:07.397 --> 00:02:08.827\nSo it's very important for\n\n42\n00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:12.380\nus to understand the idea behind\nLocard's principle of exchange.\n\n43\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.420\nAnd referring you to that just to make\nsure you're thinking about that and\n\n44\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.000\nthink about the logic of that.\n\n45\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.890\nIt's like a who done it or Clue,\nyou ever play Clue when you were a kid?\n\n46\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who didn't play Clue,\nit's an awesome game.\n\n47\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, who didn't play Clue?\n\n48\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.650\nWe could play Clue to find\nout who didn't play Clue.\n\n49\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Who didn't play Clue, exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.283\nSo, you know, if you ever\nplayed Clue as a board game, or\n\n51\n00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.250\nI guess it's probably a computer game and\nan app and who knows what these days.\n\n52\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.946\nBut back in the day when it was a board\ngame, if you ever played Clue as a kid,\n\n53\n00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:39.430\nyou would have a sense of\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.775\nYou were looking for literally,\nthose things that stood out as clues,\n\n55\n00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.850\nas evidence that would\nhelp you figure out.\n\n56\n00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.390\nWhether it was Colonel Mustard or\n\n57\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.440\nProfessor Plum or\nI don't know, whoever it was.\n\n58\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.400\n&gt;&gt; I have the Simpsons version.\n\n59\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.391\n&gt;&gt; I have not seen the Simpsons version.\n\n60\n00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:52.976\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's cool.\n&gt;&gt; It is?\n\n61\n00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:54.336\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIs that like the Monopoly version,\n\n62\n00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.937\nlike you get different things like\nthe college version of monopoly with all\n\n63\n00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:57.442\nthe schools?\n\n64\n00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:00.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything's changed\nto fit the theme, yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool.\n&gt;&gt; So it is always like Krusty the clown?\n\n66\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's whoever.\n\n67\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.170\n&gt;&gt; You don't know, the 7 11 owner right,\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n68\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.211\n&gt;&gt; Kwiki Mart.\n&gt;&gt; Kwiki Mart, that's what it was, right,\n\n69\n00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:14.180\nKwiki Mart, so whatever it may be so\nif you think about the logic of that.\n\n70\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.660\nJust keep that in mind, that will\nbe an important thought process for\n\n71\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.520\nyou, certainly in the real world, right?\n\n72\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.840\nBut also if you're planning on answering\nquestions at some point in the future,\n\n73\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.800\nyou never know.\n\n74\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.131\nBut if you're asked about what is\nan approach that helps us as a forensic\n\n75\n00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.583\ninvestigator to understand.\n\n76\n00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.538\nHow to look at a crime scene and\npotentially look for\n\n77\n00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:33.900\ntelltale clues or\nunderstand what may have transpired.\n\n78\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.110\nLocard's principle of exchange may provide\nyou that guidance and that capability, so\n\n79\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.998\njust be aware of that.\n\n80\n00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:41.700\nWe also talked about characteristics\nof digital evidence,\n\n81\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.130\nif you wanna join me here\non our little magic screen.\n\n82\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.910\nWe could see they're often\nreferred to as the seven Bs right,\n\n83\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.780\nthings the digital evidence will be.\n\n84\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.880\nIt will be relevant, probative, authentic,\naccurate, complete, convincing,\n\n85\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.020\nand of course not least and\n\n86\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.860\ncertainly not last, but equally important\nas all the rest, be admissible.\n\n87\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.980\nProbably actually the most important if\nyou think about it because we never know\n\n88\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.540\nas we establish whether evidence\nwill have to be presented\n\n89\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.100\nat some point in a court of law.\n\n90\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.823\nWe do want to have that in our minds and\njust be thinking about that at all times.\n\n91\n00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:16.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be all the other Bs and,\n[CROSSTALK] Last one, it's no good.\n\n92\n00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:20.014\n&gt;&gt; It will most likely not be good,\ncorrect, now again, you never know,\n\n93\n00:04:20.014 --> 00:04:22.010\nyou may start out something thinking.\n\n94\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.803\nIt's gonna be more of an internal\nfocused investigation and\n\n95\n00:04:24.803 --> 00:04:27.003\nat some point law enforcement\nmay be called in.\n\n96\n00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:31.350\nBecause of just uncovering new additional\nfacts or whatever the case may be.\n\n97\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.150\nRemember the whole idea of the thought\nprocess of investigating not a single\n\n98\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.840\nevent, but\n\n99\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.540\nbroadening that investigation out to all\nof the supporting cast and characters.\n\n100\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.470\nTo see if there is some sort of conspiracy\nor whatever the case maybe, and\n\n101\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.620\nas a result, right, if we extend that, we\nmay wind up in a court law at some point.\n\n102\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.378\nAnd if we have not done the other\nthings and done them correctly,\n\n103\n00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:55.077\nwe may not be able to afford ourselves the\nluxury of having evidence that admissible.\n\n104\n00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:59.308\nIt's very good point for us to think\nabout, so we do wanna make sure you\n\n105\n00:04:59.308 --> 00:05:03.490\nknow the seven Bs,\nthe characteristics of digital evidence.\n\n106\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.160\nWould be important if I was potentially\ngonna maybe think about a mix and\n\n107\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.880\nmatch kind of activity, a drag and\n\n108\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.930\ndrop kind of activity,\na fill in the blank kind of activity.\n\n109\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.497\nYou never what kind of\nquestions one may encounter\n\n110\n00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:17.626\nat some point in the future with\nregards to points like this.\n\n111\n00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:23.860\nBut lists of items, theoretical process\nsteps, specific kind of methodologies,\n\n112\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.680\nthose are all great testable items,\nthings that you would want to be aware of.\n\n113\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.501\nGreat opportunity for you to make\nsome flashcards, by the way, as well,\n\n114\n00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.561\nwe often don't speak about\nthe value of flashcards.\n\n115\n00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.397\nAnd how helpful they can be\nfrom a study perspective, but\n\n116\n00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:40.280\nmaking some flashcards up\nwouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n117\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.220\nGoing through those and\nbeing able to test yourself,\n\n118\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.170\nwhether they're electronic,\nwhether you do the old fashioned way.\n\n119\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.730\nI was a big proponent for many years,\nI know we've talked about this,\n\n120\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.740\nsometimes you are as well.\n\n121\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.700\nBut I'm one of those people that\nI have to write things down,\n\n122\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.780\nI'm a kinesthetic learner,\nI learn by doing.\n\n123\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.150\nFor me that's very important, so you look\nat going back 30, 40 something years\n\n124\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.330\nall the notes and things that I've done to\nteach and to certify and all that stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.110\nJust got boxes and\nboxes of note cards right,\n\n126\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.080\nthen again I read books the old\nfashioned way, I actually turn pages.\n\n127\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.790\n&gt;&gt; There's something\nabout having that book.\n\n128\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.580\n&gt;&gt; That whole.\n\n129\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.602\nI'm like you, I like that book.\n\n131\n00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:15.440\n&gt;&gt; I cannot I mean I could,\nI do that for a living.\n\n132\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm the most anti-technology person\n\n133\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.017\nwhen I'm not working and I will not\nhave anything to do with computers,\n\n134\n00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:24.432\nand my whole house is wrapped in tinfoil.\n\n135\n00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:25.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy,\n\n136\n00:06:25.694 --> 00:06:29.399\nit is absolutely crazy I joke about that,\nbut I'm not joking about this\n\n137\n00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:33.003\nwhen I do suggest and I'll just\nremind you, that all kidding aside.\n\n138\n00:06:33.003 --> 00:06:36.699\nFlashcards, great way to do this\nrepetitive learning that's necessary to\n\n139\n00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:37.864\nreinforce knowledge.\n\n140\n00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.695\nLike lists of things that you would wanna\nknow such as the seven B's Real quick,\n\n141\n00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:43.150\nwhat was number five?\n\n142\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.490\nRemember, without putting it up,\ndon't put it up, what was number five?\n\n143\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.693\n&gt;&gt; Be complete.\n\n144\n00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.575\n&gt;&gt; That was good, you didn't even look\nat the little notes you have there,\n\n145\n00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.518\nI like that, that was good, I gotta\ncome up with a better way to trick you.\n\n146\n00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:55.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ask you something you're not paying\n\n147\n00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:58.116\nattention to next time, all right so,\nwe have talked about the seven B's.\n\n148\n00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:00.378\nThe characteristics of digital evidence,\nwhat about the rules of evidence?\n\n149\n00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.346\nWe've spoken about those, these are the\nrules that govern the who and when, where,\n\n150\n00:07:04.346 --> 00:07:05.210\nwhy and how.\n\n151\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.141\nYou govern whether, when, how and for what\npurpose we will be able to prove what has\n\n152\n00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:12.687\ntranspired and understand how to manage.\n\n153\n00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:17.523\nThe evidence will help us how to do that\nbefore we put stuff into a code of law,\n\n154\n00:07:17.523 --> 00:07:21.240\nbefore a body that will weigh\nit's informational value.\n\n155\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.785\nAnd whether or not it is going to be\nallowed to be presented to prove or\n\n156\n00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:25.840\ndisprove something.\n\n157\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.850\nWe have to make sure we follow certain\nrules, we've talked about those, so\n\n158\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.615\nkeep that in mind.\n\n159\n00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:35.555\nYou'll remember the trier of fact as we\nrefer to it, can be a judge or a jury.\n\n160\n00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:40.099\nMany cases will go before a jury but many\nof them will simply be heard by a judge\n\n161\n00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.512\nand will never go to a jury and\neither one is appropriate.\n\n162\n00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:47.622\nWe just need to understand\nhow that works in the fact\n\n163\n00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:51.170\nthat either one may wind\nup being the place.\n\n164\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.603\nIn which we find ourselves as\nan investigator, offering evidence,\n\n165\n00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:57.157\noffering testimony,\nwe have to think about that.\n\n166\n00:07:57.157 --> 00:08:01.851\nDigital evidence is defined as any\ninformation of probative value, that's\n\n167\n00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:06.845\na fun word to say, probative, probative\nvalue, remember, what was the movie?\n\n168\n00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:11.024\nWith the space bugs and the space marines?\n\n169\n00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.970\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming you're talking\nabout Starship Troopers?\n\n170\n00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, Starship Troopers.\n\n171\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.856\nRemember Starship Troopers?\n\n172\n00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:17.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.559\n&gt;&gt; You don't have the big\nbug probe anymore?\n\n174\n00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:20.587\n&gt;&gt; Would you like to know more?\n\n175\n00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:22.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is a great movie.\n\n176\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.123\nFirst one [CROSSTALK]\nfirst one was a good one.\n\n177\n00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.372\nSo, digital information is any\ninformation of value, as we said,\n\n178\n00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:32.030\nthat is either stored or\ntransmitted in digital form.\n\n179\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.980\nIn other words, digital evidence is\ninformation of digital type that has value\n\n180\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.990\nthat can offer insight to us as\nwe're looking to understand and\n\n181\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.170\nultimately document what has transpired,\nwhat kind of activities have taken place,\n\n182\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.180\nwho's at the heart of that,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n183\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.650\nJust want to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n184\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.800\nBut keep in mind the challenges\nwith digital evidence do abound,\n\n185\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.995\nas I talk about in my notes a little\nbit and as we talk about here.\n\n186\n00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:59.045\nSo, if I asked you, Daniel, perhaps you\ncould help me here for just a minute.\n\n187\n00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.115\n&gt;&gt; I can try.\n&gt;&gt; You could try,\n\n188\n00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:02.625\nand you do often jump right in and\nyou do try.\n\n189\n00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.035\nSo, what would be some of the challenges?\n\n190\n00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:05.385\nWe wanna put together a little list for\n\n191\n00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:08.250\npeople about challenges with\nregards to digital evidence.\n\n192\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.520\nWhat would be some of the things that\nwould be at the top of that list,\n\n193\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.800\nwhat would you think of?\n\n194\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.270\n&gt;&gt; I would assume like maintaining the\nstate of the evidence to make sure that\n\n195\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.310\nit maintains integrity.\n\n196\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.282\nI would think that that's probably top\nof the list, at least in my experience,\n\n197\n00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:25.211\nto make sure that nothing has changed so\nthat it is admissible, if necessary.\n\n198\n00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.527\nThat would be top of\nmy list of challenges.\n\n199\n00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:32.177\nAnd a lot of the other challenges\nI would say stem from that,\n\n200\n00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:37.730\nkeeping that from happening, keeping state\nchanges from occurring to the evidence.\n\n201\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.770\nPeople coming into a crime scene and\ntrampling over evidence.\n\n202\n00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.610\nPeople moving things\nwithout first documenting\n\n203\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.840\nwhat the state was before they moved it.\n\n204\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.670\nThat, to me, I think is probably\nthe number one thing I think of.\n\n205\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.129\n&gt;&gt; So the ability to,\nas you said, maintain integrity,\n\n206\n00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:54.534\nmaintain the knowledge of\nits state around the data,\n\n207\n00:09:54.534 --> 00:09:57.590\nthis idea of the rules of evidence,\nhandling the chain of custody.\n\n208\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.523\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All those things kind of get\n\n209\n00:09:58.523 --> 00:09:59.106\nrolled up absolutely.\n\n210\n00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:00.538\nAnd also, because of that,\n\n211\n00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:04.432\nmaintaining viability of that evidence\nthroughout the life cycle, right?\n\n212\n00:10:04.432 --> 00:10:06.916\nFrom the time we essentially\nwalk in first moment and\n\n213\n00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:10.641\nsee the evidence laying there at the crime\nscene til either we show up at trial,\n\n214\n00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:14.700\nperhaps days, weeks, months, years later,\nhard to say how long that would take.\n\n215\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.110\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And/or if we don't wanna go into trial\n\n216\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.590\nbut have to secure that evidence for a\nperiod of time because of the proceedings.\n\n217\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.390\nUltimately, then, destroying the evidence\nif it's no longer needed and\n\n218\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.700\nnobody claims it, or returning it to the\nrightful owner if at the end of that cycle\n\n219\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.480\nthey're still around and are free and\nable to take possession of that evidence.\n\n220\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.350\nWhatever the case may be,\nit's the care and feeding,\n\n221\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.570\nthe maintenance of the evidence life cycle\nthat really is the biggest challenge,\n\n222\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.760\nas Daniel rightly points out.\n\n223\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.270\nAnd we want to make sure we're\nfocused on that because as\n\n224\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.310\nforensic investigators the biggest\nchallenge we face is understanding how to\n\n225\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.060\ndo our job methodically, understanding\nhow do our job correctly, and\n\n226\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.510\nunderstanding how to do our job\nin a way that validates and\n\n227\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.895\nverifies that we were able to\nfollow the steps necessary\n\n228\n00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:59.735\nto safeguard the evidence and provide this\ncustody and chain of life cycle management\n\n229\n00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:04.085\nthat allows us to authoritatively say that\nevidence is indeed gonna have value and\n\n230\n00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:08.805\ncan be presented today, tomorrow, a year\nfrom now, and it will still hold value\n\n231\n00:11:08.805 --> 00:11:11.645\nbecause it will not be modified or\nchanged in any way shape or form.\n\n232\n00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:13.515\nThis is the most important\nchallenge we face and\n\n233\n00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:15.275\nthe one that you have to think about and\nbe aware of.\n\n234\n00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:18.350\nThe fragility of data, in other words,\nis really what we focus on.\n\n235\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.630\nWe have to think about that.\n\n236\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.813\nWe also think about the rise of something\nknown as anti-digital forensics,\n\n237\n00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:26.670\na whole area of practice and\ninvestigation.\n\n238\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.813\nAnd area that you may be involved with or\nperhaps interested in called ADF,\n\n239\n00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:32.435\nanti-digital forensics.\n\n240\n00:11:32.435 --> 00:11:37.310\nThis seeks take advantage of data\nfragility or to play on the understanding\n\n241\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.920\nof and therefore the issues associated\nwith the fact that data is ephemera,\n\n242\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.670\nthat it is volatile, that it can be\nspoiled and rendered inoperable and\n\n243\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.860\ntherefore not usable\nthrough the deployment and\n\n244\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.260\nuse of counter-forensics tools and\napproaches to be able to modify data,\n\n245\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.140\nto obfuscate it, to essentially destroy\nits integrity and therefore its value.\n\n246\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.850\nIn other words, what hackers do\n\n247\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.630\nin response to leaving evidence behind\nmaybe to return and try to invalidate that\n\n248\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.410\nevidence that they find out they've left\nsomething behind by trying to mess it up.\n\n249\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.980\nSo this is whole other area that as\na forensic investigator we have to\n\n250\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.950\nbecome aware of.\n\n251\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.720\nBecause it's the steps that people will\ntake to invalidate the chain of custody.\n\n252\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.270\nThe steps that people will take to\ninvalidate the value of that evidence and\n\n253\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:25.330\nto attack it, and therefore render it\nnot usable or inappropriate in some way.\n\n254\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.220\nThere is a name for this, and there is\na whole methodology associated with this.\n\n255\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.360\nWe don't often think about it cuz we lump\nit into general hacking and just say,\n\n256\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.990\nwell, yeah, that's what hackers do.\n\n257\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.537\nAnd you're right, that's what they do, but\nthey may be paid specifically to target\n\n258\n00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:39.201\nthis evidence by somebody who\ndoesn't wanna be found guilty and\n\n259\n00:12:39.201 --> 00:12:42.540\nrealizes that they may have left\nbehind some sort tell-tale evidence.\n\n260\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.300\nWe're not talking about fingerprints and\nstuff like that because that's a little\n\n261\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.610\nbit harder to mess around with and\nto obviously change.\n\n262\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.436\nYou find someone's fingerprint, scan it,\ndo a match, find out it's so and so.\n\n263\n00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:52.520\nIt's harder then to go back and say, no,\n\n264\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.390\nit wasn't them,\nit was really somebody else.\n\n265\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.450\nBut when we're talking about things like,\nperhaps, data on a hard drive, and\n\n266\n00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.700\nerasing that hard drive before\nwe have authoritative copy, or\n\n267\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.900\nmodifying it so that an authoritative\ncopy will not be able to be possible and\n\n268\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.780\nbe made because now the data has\nbeen modified and tampered with.\n\n269\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.270\nThese are things that the ADF,\n\n270\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.100\nthe anti-digital forensics tool kit,\nwould involve and this is hacking 101,\n\n271\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.340\nbut this is hacking for\na purpose, hacking for a cause.\n\n272\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.650\nSo this is something that we also have to\ncontend with as a forensics investigator.\n\n273\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.880\nPeople looking to do harm specifically\ntargeting the evidence that we have found.\n\n274\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.170\nAnd this is also a growing concern to us,\nbecause there is malware out there\n\n275\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.120\nthat will be used targeting\nspecifically these kinds of systems and\n\n276\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.970\nbe looking for this kind of evidence.\n\n277\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.210\nSomebody may be paid to break in and\nphysically steal hardware, right?\n\n278\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.570\nOr physically steal information and\nlock up.\n\n279\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.280\nThey may be paid to\nmodify the evidence logs,\n\n280\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.530\nmake you look as if it wasn't handled\nproperly, even though it was.\n\n281\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.660\nThere's all these different approaches\nthat we may find and think about there.\n\n282\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.250\nSo we gotta just be thinking about that.\n\n283\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.350\nRules of evidence, you gotta follow them,\nas I point out in my notes for\n\n284\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.030\nthis segment.\n\n285\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.420\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n286\n00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.260\nIf we violate even the tiniest rule,\n\n287\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.630\nand it may seem inconsequential\nat the time to us, I'm tired,\n\n288\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.050\nI'm not gonna bother writing that down,\nI'll deal with it in the morning.\n\n289\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.150\nAnd then you forget.\n\n290\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.260\nThat's it, you're done, right?\n\n291\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.720\nThe smallest gap, the smallest little\nidiosyncrasy that is not done correctly\n\n292\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.290\ncan be enough to disqualify the evidence.\n\n293\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.510\nWe do have to think about that and\nbe aware of that, and\n\n294\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.100\nwe have a lot of rules and\nvery specific guidance around evidence.\n\n295\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.400\nSo we're gonna go through in great\ndetail the federal rules of evidence,\n\n296\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.030\nthe United States federal\nrules of evidence, and\n\n297\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.730\ntalk about the ones that are specific to\nthis particular set of endeavors, and\n\n298\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.780\nthe ones you need to be aware of.\n\n299\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.660\nAnd we'll show you the verbiage of them\nand talk about them in this episode\n\n300\n00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.416\nand probably out into another one cuz it's\nprobably going to take more than the last\n\n301\n00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:37.660\npart of this episode to\ngo through them all.\n\n302\n00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.010\nBut you're going to have to be aware\nof all of these, especially, again,\n\n303\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.410\nif you're doing work in the United States.\n\n304\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.170\nIf you're practicing in\na country that is not the US,\n\n305\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.070\nthat doesn't mean that these rules are not\nimportant, but it means they're probably\n\n306\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.620\nnot going to be applied, necessarily,\nin the same way to your legal system.\n\n307\n00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.750\nYou would certainly need to localize\nthat discussion and that knowledge.\n\n308\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:01.170\nBut as a baseline, that's a general\nthought process, they give us the idea and\n\n309\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.440\nthe foundational understanding of how we\nshould approach management of evidence and\n\n310\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.790\npreparation of evidence and presentation\nof evidence as well as maintaining,\n\n311\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.510\nmaintainance and grooming of evidence\nthroughout the life cycle, so\n\n312\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.940\nthat if we do have to go to court as we\nhave suggested, we can do so successfully.\n\n313\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.520\nBut keep in mind as I suggested,\nthat not everywhere in the world,\n\n314\n00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.360\nas a matter of fact most places\nin the world, are not going to be\n\n315\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.040\nfollowing the same exact letter of\nthe law the way we will present it here.\n\n316\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.270\nThese are the United States\nspecific Federal rules of evidence,\n\n317\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.540\njust wanna be clear about that.\n\n318\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.630\nBut we have what's known\nas the best evidence rule.\n\n319\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.010\nThe best evidence rule is\nthe idea that the court only\n\n320\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.850\nwill allow the original evidence in of\nsomething like a document, a photograph,\n\n321\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.530\nor a recording rather than a copy.\n\n322\n00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.660\nThe idea being that if we could provide\nthe original, that's the absolute best\n\n323\n00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.560\nsource because it is the legitimate\noriginator of that information.\n\n324\n00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.430\nIf we can't do that,\n\n325\n00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.630\nwe could have a certified copy that was\ncreated forensically in a sound way.\n\n326\n00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.698\nBe prepared to present that.\n\n327\n00:15:57.698 --> 00:16:01.647\nSo, you may present a copy of the hard\ndrive that was forensically created and\n\n328\n00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:03.187\ntherefore soundly created.\n\n329\n00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:04.642\nA duplicate will be allowed.\n\n330\n00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:06.413\nBut only under certain conditions.\n\n331\n00:16:06.413 --> 00:16:10.049\nSo we have a preferential thought\nprocess in the law that says,\n\n332\n00:16:10.049 --> 00:16:14.370\nwhen and where possible present\nthe original as opposed to a duplicate.\n\n333\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.910\nBecause the original is not gonna be\nchallenged and therefore, potentially\n\n334\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:23.840\nsubject to doubt and concern in the mind\nof somebody, because it is the original.\n\n335\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.039\nIf the copy is there,\nit opens up the door for\n\n336\n00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:29.141\nquestioning about whether that\ncopy was obtained properly.\n\n337\n00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:33.960\nIf the proper forensic procedures have\nmaintained properly throughout that life\n\n338\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.900\ncycle to ensure that it is an exact match.\n\n339\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.860\nAnd as an investigator,\nwho will present evidence,\n\n340\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.900\npotentially who will testify at trial.\n\n341\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.630\nOne or more of them,\nyou would have to go a little bit extra,\n\n342\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:51.790\nin terms of presenting documentation to\nvalidate that a copy is being presented.\n\n343\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.820\nAnd it is forensically sound and matches\nthe original, it's open to scrutiny,\n\n344\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.550\nin other words.\n\n345\n00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.094\nWhereas if you present the original,\nand you see this a lot in these, again,\n\n346\n00:17:00.094 --> 00:17:03.230\nin movies and court dramas,\nwhatever, where they present, okay,\n\n347\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.505\npeople's evidence,\npeople's number five, Your Honor.\n\n348\n00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:07.900\nThey'll show you the document in the bag.\n\n349\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.780\nSo it can be handled\nwithout messing it up, but\n\n350\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.845\nthey're always presenting the lawyer,\nnormally.\n\n351\n00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:14.920\nIt's always presenting\nthe original document as opposed\n\n352\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.490\nto a copy of the document\nmore often than not.\n\n353\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.920\nRight, look, we have this footage\nfrom the security camera,\n\n354\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.020\nthey'll play the footage, it's\nthe direct recording that kind of thing.\n\n355\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.720\nRemember My Cousin Vinny?\n\n356\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.430\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great movie,\n\n357\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:25.980\ngreat [INAUDIBLE] movie.\n\n358\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.804\n&gt;&gt; Great, yeah, how do you know?\n\n359\n00:17:26.804 --> 00:17:30.379\nWell, because the tires on that car,\nthat was a great, I love Marissa Tomei,\n\n360\n00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:31.530\nshe's a great actress.\n\n361\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.998\nI love all the people in it,\nbut especially and\n\n362\n00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:37.429\nwho would've thought the Karate Kid,\ngrow up and there you go.\n\n363\n00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:40.189\nAll right,\nthere's a movie like what three, four-\n\n364\n00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Karate Kid?\n\n365\n00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.546\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, it's another good one.\n\n366\n00:17:41.546 --> 00:17:44.100\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite movies of all time\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n\n367\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.881\n&gt;&gt; I still have an original\ncopy a VHS copy from 1985.\n\n368\n00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.713\n&gt;&gt; Mr Miyagi.\n\n369\n00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:48.303\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n370\n00:17:48.303 --> 00:17:50.343\n&gt;&gt; The whole crane.\n\n371\n00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:52.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No can defend.\n\n372\n00:17:52.302 --> 00:17:53.393\n&gt;&gt; No, no, apparently not.\n\n373\n00:17:53.393 --> 00:17:56.812\nAll right, so anyway [LAUGH] we digress.\n\n374\n00:17:56.812 --> 00:17:59.190\nYou and I cannot spend time\ntogether in the same room\n\n375\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.707\n&gt;&gt; Do not mention\n\n376\n00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:00.744\nmovies with these two guys.\n\n377\n00:18:00.744 --> 00:18:01.500\n&gt;&gt; Movies or music.\n\n378\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.578\nMovies or music, either one.\n\n379\n00:18:02.578 --> 00:18:03.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n380\n00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.440\nunder the following conditions, we can\nactually present a copy of evidence,\n\n381\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.020\njust wanna make sure\nthat we're clear on this.\n\n382\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.850\nSo if the original evidence has\nbeen in some way destroyed, but\n\n383\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.140\nnot just destroyed, like you broke\ninto the room, ripped it up, and\n\n384\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.570\nyou're the guy who we're trying, though.\n\n385\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.130\nThat's not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.930\n&gt;&gt; Not acceptable,\n\n387\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.100\nyou don't get a pass on that.\n\n388\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.290\nIf it was destroyed due to fire or flood.\n\n389\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.118\nIn other words,\n\n390\n00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:24.390\nsome sort of natural act that potentially\ncould have destroyed the evidence.\n\n391\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.528\nDestroyed in the normal\ncourse of business,\n\n392\n00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:28.728\nshredded because it may\nbe a retention issue.\n\n393\n00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:31.300\nYou hit the end of the policy,\nyou get rid of it, or\n\n394\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.611\nif the original evidence is in\nthe possession of a third party and\n\n395\n00:18:34.611 --> 00:18:38.260\nit cannot be brought to trial,\nduring that time but a certified copy.\n\n396\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.889\nAgain a copy that was made in a sound way\nthat could be validated can be presented,\n\n397\n00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:47.020\nit would be allowed as an exception\nunder the best evidence rule.\n\n398\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.900\nBut there are very limited\nnarrowly defined exceptions.\n\n399\n00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.540\nNormally, our preference is\npresent the original evidence.\n\n400\n00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.965\nAnd if you can't do that, you gotta\nhave a really compelling reason why.\n\n401\n00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:57.726\nAnd if you don't have a really\ncompelling reason why,\n\n402\n00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.549\nwe may not be interested in\nactually entertaining, and\n\n403\n00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:04.770\nseeing that evidence first hand, because\nit may not be seen as being appropriate.\n\n404\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.870\nSo that is something for you to consider,\nsomething for you to be aware of.\n\n405\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.665\nThe best evidence rule that we talk about.\n\n406\n00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:13.852\nI'm gonna suggest to you, sir, that we may\nwanna end up a little bit early on this\n\n407\n00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:18.180\nepisode, and come on back and jump into\nthe federal rules of evidence discussion.\n\n408\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.960\nAs I said, it's a fairly lengthy one,\n\n409\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.170\nand it's gonna take more than the few\nminutes we have left for this episode.\n\n410\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.890\nRather than splitting it up and\nhaving to recount everything,\n\n411\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.340\nmay be better just to try to\npush through in one episode.\n\n412\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.974\n&gt;&gt; More of a natural\nstopping spot right here.\n\n413\n00:19:29.974 --> 00:19:33.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a good kind of prep spot\nto catch our breath before we engage in\n\n414\n00:19:33.954 --> 00:19:37.110\nthe long journey through\nthe federal rules of evidence.\n\n415\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.870\n&gt;&gt; Let's ask our audience.\n\n416\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.890\nAudience, are you good with that?\n\n417\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.770\nYou're good, okay, thanks.\n\n418\n00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.461\nSo that's what we'll do then.\n\n419\n00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:41.051\n&gt;&gt; We have a poll?\n\n420\n00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we took a poll.\n\n421\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.524\n&gt;&gt; Did you count the guy in\nthe back with his hand up twice?\n\n422\n00:19:43.524 --> 00:19:45.094\n&gt;&gt; I did, I made sure to get him and,\n\n423\n00:19:45.094 --> 00:19:47.520\nbecause he loves to complain\nevery time we forget.\n\n424\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well you gotta account for\neverybody.\n\n425\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.200\n&gt;&gt; All right everyone, it looks like\nwe're in for a part four on this one.\n\n426\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.260\nDefinitely join us back for that.\n\n427\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.230\nWe thank Adam for joining us,\nwe thank you for joining us.\n\n428\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.890\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host,

it.\n\n19\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.910\n&gt;&gt; That is what we are gonna\nspend our session here.\n\n20\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970\n&gt;&gt; It could be important\nto our conversation.\n\n21\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.300\n&gt;&gt; It may very well be.\n\n22\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.360\nIt could be relevant and as a result,\nprobative in value as we would say.\n\n23\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.725\nSo we did I promised you as we ended our\nlast episode, that we would come back and\n\n24\n00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.535\nfocus in this part four on\nthe US Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n25\n00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.735\nSo that's exactly what we're gonna do.\n\n26\n00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:58.695\nWe're gonna jump in and\n\n27\n00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.275\nwalk you through the most pertinent\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\n\n28\n00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:03.385\nNot all of them,\nthe book is extensive and long and\n\n29\n00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.605\nyou don't want to have to read\nthat unless absolutely necessary.\n\n30\n00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:10.367\nBut there are certain rules specific to\ndigital forensics, computer forensics.\n\n31\n00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.955\nWe wanna focus in on some of those,\nhelp us to better understand\n\n32\n00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:15.580\nhow those rules may effect\nour ability to do our job.\n\n33\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.352\nBe a little bit knowledgeable about them.\n\n34\n00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:20.394\nBig disclaimers we've talked about before,\nremind you here yet again.\n\n35\n00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:21.690\nDepending on where you are in the world.\n\n36\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.540\nThat many, many people will interact\nwith the Federal Rules of Evidence,\n\n37\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.280\nbecause they are gonna be doing this kind\nof work somewhere in the United States, or\n\n38\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.210\nin an area where the United States\nhas jurisdiction.\n\n39\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.440\nBut there are many, many,\nprobably even more so,\n\n40\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.230\nsecurity professionals and\nforensic investigators that will operate\n\n41\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.290\noutside of the boundaries\nof that jurisdiction.\n\n42\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.042\nAnd as a result, may not have to have\ndirect knowledge of or adhere to or\n\n43\n00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:47.062\nbe bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence\nthat are gonna be discussed here.\n\n44\n00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:48.682\nWe are taking a very specific and\n\n45\n00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:53.004\nuniquely tailored US centric approach to\nthis particular episode in conversation.\n\n46\n00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.996\nDo wanna acknowledge the fact that\nthere are many, many other law systems\n\n47\n00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.780\nout there in the world that will\nhave a different take on this.\n\n48\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.560\nAnd just make sure we understand and\nacknowledge the fact that this is not\n\n49\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.750\nthe last authoritative work\non the subject by any means.\n\n50\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.600\nBut it is the one that we\nare gonna present here.\n\n51\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.270\nAnd this is equally and\nespecially important for you to know,\n\n52\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.010\nthe one that may be relevant for\nyou with regards with exam preparation.\n\n53\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.781\nSo wanna make sure that\nfrom that perspective,\n\n54\n00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.253\nyou are understanding the knowledge.\n\n55\n00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:19.162\nEven if you're not operating in the US,\nyou're looking at our content and\n\n56\n00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:20.654\nwatching us from somewhere outside.\n\n57\n00:02:20.654 --> 00:02:23.828\nAnd we hope that you are and\nare excited by the fact that you are, but\n\n58\n00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:27.398\nwant you to know that if you were gonna\nsit for the CHFI exam, you would wanna\n\n59\n00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:31.510\nhave at least passing familiarity with\nthe discussion we're gonna have now.\n\n60\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.170\nMay prove to be important for\nyou with regards to answering questions.\n\n61\n00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.279\nSo with that in mind and\nto that end if would you join me here, and\n\n62\n00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.635\nwe will begin our journey.\n\n63\n00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.068\nWe're gonna have to go\nfull screen on this,\n\n64\n00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.557\nonly because there's a lot of information.\n\n65\n00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.860\nIt's gonna be very tough for\nyou to see otherwise.\n\n66\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.051\nWe're gonna walk through\nthe rules of evidence,\n\n67\n00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.530\nit's kind of a beginning disclaimer here,\nthe rules of evidence, as many laws are.\n\n68\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.420\nMany rules associated with the laws\nare gonna be in any country\n\n69\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.200\nanywhere in the world.\n\n70\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.110\nThey are numbered and identified using\nsome sort of unique and special system.\n\n71\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.130\nThis numbering system here with regards\nto the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\n72\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.320\nfollows a very straightforward system.\n\n73\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.500\nRule number, rule 101, 102, 103, whatever\nwith some sort of designated rule 101\n\n74\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.570\nfocuses on scope, rule 102, purpose and\nconstruction, you get the general idea.\n\n75\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.190\nSo we're referencing them\nfrom that perspective.\n\n76\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.080\nRule 101 with Scope, the idea here really\nlays out the foundational element here for\n\n77\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.120\nus with regards to,\nhow we have the right and\n\n78\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.170\ntherefore the ability to understand\nthat we may actually entertain\n\n79\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.200\ncertain cases before a judge and,\nor a jury in the United States.\n\n80\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.370\nBecause the rules that are laid\nout will specify the scope, and\n\n81\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.436\ntherefore the ability to be able to\ninteract with certain kinds of cases.\n\n82\n00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:41.950\nThese rules as you could see here,\ngovern rules and proceedings in the US and\n\n83\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.220\nbefore any kind of,\nin this case bankruptcy judge.\n\n84\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.600\nWe're not really focused\non bankruptcy here,\n\n85\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.270\nbut the rule is just written this way.\n\n86\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.435\nSo we're explaining it and\n\n87\n00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:52.432\npresenting it to you using the language\nthat is available in the rule.\n\n88\n00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:56.494\nAnd United States magistrate judges\nmeeting anywhere within the judicial\n\n89\n00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:59.008\nsystem of the United States,\nto the extent and\n\n90\n00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:01.463\nwith the exception stated in rule 1101.\n\n91\n00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:04.488\nMeaning any other rules that\nmay be followed or stressed, or\n\n92\n00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:06.160\npreferenced will be available.\n\n93\n00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.390\nBut we are given broad governance and\nguidance in terms of the ability to cover,\n\n94\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.080\nand therefore present cases\ninside the United States courts\n\n95\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.482\nassuming we follow this rules\nessentially what that rule says.\n\n96\n00:04:18.482 --> 00:04:19.520\nRule 102, purpose and\n\n97\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.350\nconstruction, we are constructing\nthese rules that you can see there,\n\n98\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.430\nfairness in administration elimination\nof unjustifiable expense and delay.\n\n99\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.220\nMeaning we need a speedy trial,\nwe should be able to do that for\n\n100\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.180\neverybody regardless of\nany other circumstances.\n\n101\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.540\nAnd promotion and development of the law\nof evidence to the end that the truth may\n\n102\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.600\nbe ascertained and\nproceedings justly determined.\n\n103\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.420\nHow'd you like to do a person to\nsit down and think of stuff up,\n\n104\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.990\nand write it down and\nfollow the flowery language?\n\n105\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.910\nThis is like William Shakespeare,\nbut only on this evil twin brother.\n\n106\n00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.232\n&gt;&gt; Somebody [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Bobby Shakespeare who did the law.\n\n107\n00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:54.364\n&gt;&gt; They got themselves\na degree in literature, and\n\n108\n00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:55.981\nnow this is what they do for a living.\n\n109\n00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:57.544\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is what they're doing,\n\n110\n00:04:57.544 --> 00:04:59.527\ncuz they were not able to\ndo anything else, right?\n\n111\n00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:03.184\nAll right, so if we go back here you'll\nsee now Rule 103, Rulings on Evidence.\n\n112\n00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:07.327\nThis is where we start to get into stuff\nthat's actually gonna be important to us,\n\n113\n00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:11.232\nspecifically what kinds of rulings are we\ngonna deal with regards to evidence\n\n114\n00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:14.475\nthat may structure,\nthe way evidence is gonna be entertained,\n\n115\n00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:17.265\nif evidence is presented erroneously,\nwhat do we do?\n\n116\n00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:20.165\nIf we have to have a hearing\nhow do we do that,\n\n117\n00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:22.165\nunder what circumstances,\nthings like that, right?\n\n118\n00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:24.635\nSo you can see effect of erroneous ruling,\n\n119\n00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:27.165\nif there's an error how\ndo we deal with that?\n\n120\n00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:30.455\nIf there's an objection, if we have to\noffer proof how do we deal with that?\n\n121\n00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.470\nYou could see the documentation there.\n\n122\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.410\nThe record of offer and ruling,\nthe court may add any other or\n\n123\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.170\nfurther statement which shows\nthe character of the evidence, the form in\n\n124\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.270\nwhich it was offered, the objection made,\nand the ruling thereon or thereof.\n\n125\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.020\nIt may direct the making of an offer\nin question and answer form.\n\n126\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.020\nIn other words, this lays out\nthe structure and the set of rules that\n\n127\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.560\nallow us to understand how a traditional\ntrial is carried out, right?\n\n128\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.100\nSomebody stands up or sits on the stand,\nis sworn in, then the opposing\n\n129\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.100\ncounsel is able to ask them questions,\nexpect answers and follow up in that form.\n\n130\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.370\nAnd this is why we do things the way we\ndo it, because these are the rules that\n\n131\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.420\nlay out the form and therefore\nthe structure that we will follow.\n\n132\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.380\nHearing of jury, proceeding shall be\nconducted to the extent practicable as so\n\n133\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.780\nto prevent any admissible evidence.\n\n134\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.990\nWe've talked about this.\n\n135\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.230\nFrom being suggestive to the jury by\nany means, such as making statements or\n\n136\n00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.970\noffer statements of proof, or asking\nquestions in the hearing of the jury.\n\n137\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.434\nIn other words you cannot knowingly\npresent evidence that it's false, and\n\n138\n00:06:25.434 --> 00:06:27.219\nyou're supposed to take every step and\n\n139\n00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.940\nreasonable protection possible to\npresent the introduction of evidence.\n\n140\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.140\nThat could bias the jury and present\nitself in a way that would lead them\n\n141\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.680\nto believe it is in fact\ntrue when it is not.\n\n142\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.960\nPlain error, if there is going to be\nan error, you could see here nothing in\n\n143\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.470\nthis rule precludes taking notice of\nplain errors affecting substantial rights\n\n144\n00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.040\nalthough they were not brought\nto the attention of the court.\n\n145\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.980\nIn other words, if there is an error\nthat it's just outstanding,\n\n146\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.930\nthat is obvious there's something to\npresent to from pointing that out.\n\n147\n00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.204\nIt's saying, hey, you know what?\n\n148\n00:06:51.204 --> 00:06:54.377\nMy name is not Adam John Gordon.\n\n149\n00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:55.780\nMy name is Adam Gordon.\n\n150\n00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.352\nThat's an error.\n\n151\n00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:58.440\nI wanna correct that for\npurposes of the trial,\n\n152\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.550\nsince I want it to be clear who is and\nwho's not offering testimony.\n\n153\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.140\nThat's what we call a plain error,\nit's obvious to somebody, and\n\n154\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.017\nthey're pointing it out, there's no\nrule that prevents that by the way.\n\n155\n00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:10.376\nAnd this rule specifically states that\nwe should be encouraged to do that and\n\n156\n00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:12.318\nbe allowed to do that,\nwhen it is sensical,\n\n157\n00:07:12.318 --> 00:07:14.770\nin other words when it is obvious and\nmakes sense.\n\n158\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.410\nWe have a Rule 105, limited admissibility.\n\n159\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.852\nWhen evidence will and will not be\nadmissible, and under what conditions.\n\n160\n00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:21.992\nWe have to think about that.\n\n161\n00:07:21.992 --> 00:07:24.491\nAnd we'll talk about hearsay in just\na minute and how we deal with that.\n\n162\n00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:28.773\nBut limited admissibility, when evidence\nwhich is admissible as to one party or for\n\n163\n00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:31.666\none purpose but\nnot admissible as to another part, or for\n\n164\n00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:33.253\nanother purpose is admitted.\n\n165\n00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:36.620\nThe court upon request shall restrict\nthe evidence to it's proper scope and\n\n166\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.943\ninstruct duly accordingly.\n\n167\n00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:42.537\nYou see this play out all the time and\nthese crime time on TV where evidence\n\n168\n00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:45.885\npresented, but\nis limited in scope by the courts.\n\n169\n00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:47.930\nCertainly we say by the court,\nwe mean judge, right?\n\n170\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.619\nThe judge says okay, I will instruct the\njury to ignore that or only allow this.\n\n171\n00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.964\nSo you could only present this information\nin this way, Mr. and Mrs. Prosecutor, but\n\n172\n00:07:55.964 --> 00:08:00.087\nyou can't go in to this other stuff over\nhere It's like it doesn't exist, right?\n\n173\n00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:02.487\nAnd so,\nlimited admissibility is filtering, right?\n\n174\n00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:03.650\nIt's tailoring and scoping.\n\n175\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.440\nIt's the ability to present information,\nexplain it, given certain parameters,\n\n176\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.870\nbut not to go beyond those parameters,\nif you want the evidence to be admitted,\n\n177\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.400\nif the Court will allow you to.\n\n178\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.510\nIf you violate that rule, there could\nbe a mistrial which you often hear and\n\n179\n00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.290\nthink about and see.\n\n180\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.700\nHey, you know what, call for a meeting\nmistrial judge, motion, because so\n\n181\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.110\nand so did this and\nthat prejudiced the jury and\n\n182\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.930\nwe agreed we weren't gonna do\nthat ahead of time, right?\n\n183\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.180\nSo that's the kind of thing\nthat falls under rule 105,\n\n184\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.110\nthe limited admissibility rule.\n\n185\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.310\nAnd so it's important to identify and\nknow that.\n\n186\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.470\nWe go on to reference, and\n\n187\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.790\nI go on to reference here,\nrule 801 of the federal rules of evidence.\n\n188\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.082\nThis is the hearsay rule,\n\n189\n00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:40.870\nthe rule associated with evidence\nthat may be considered hearsay.\n\n190\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.295\nHearsay, we go on to define,\n\n191\n00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:47.020\nis a statement other than the one made by\nthe declarant, the declarant is the person\n\n192\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.320\nmaking the statement, while testifying\nat the ongoing trial or hearing.\n\n193\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.890\nIn other words,\nif Daniel were to say Adam,\n\n194\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.600\nI heard so-and-so said, at this day and\ntime, that would be hearsay, because\n\n195\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.230\nDaniel's relating something somebody else\nsaid, essentially, as a third party.\n\n196\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.920\nHe's not saying Don said this and Don is\ntelling you this, cuz Don's telling you,\n\n197\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.810\nbut rather, I heard Don say this,\nand I'm relaying this to you.\n\n198\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.900\nThat is considered hearsay.\n\n199\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.440\nWe have to tightly control and\nunderstand the use of hearsay.\n\n200\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.730\nIt may be admissible under certain tightly\ncontrolled and constrained circumstances.\n\n201\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.580\nBut generally, hearsay is not considered\nto be good evidence, because, again,\n\n202\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.110\nit's like playing telephone, right?\n\n203\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.840\nYou start out by saying, hey,\ndo you want to go have lunch?\n\n204\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.650\nYou end up with something like I want\nto take my car into the shop and\n\n205\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.610\nget an oil change, right?\n\n206\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.110\nIt totally changes by\nthe time you do that and\n\n207\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.380\nit makes it's way around, because chances\nare good people are adding or modifying,\n\n208\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.970\nand there's no integrity,\nno check mechanism,\n\n209\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.530\nthat validates whether the message\nis legitimate when it comes through.\n\n210\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.350\nAnd as a result, this can lead to\nmisrepresentation, misinterpretation, and\n\n211\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.920\nessentially, misdirection,\nwhether it's purposeful or not.\n\n212\n00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.360\nBut ultimately in the eyes of the law we\nhave to avoid that if at all possible and\n\n213\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.330\nthis is what the hearsay issues and\nregulations and rules are all about.\n\n214\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.290\nSo it's offered as evidence to prove\nthe truth of the matter asserted,\n\n215\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.120\nwe're saying.\n\n216\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.370\nHearsay is not admissible,\nvery important here.\n\n217\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.330\nHearsay is not admissible,\nexcept as provided by this rule.\n\n218\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.380\nMeaning, again,\ncertain circumstances will be allowed.\n\n219\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.180\nBut normally hearsay is not allowed.\n\n220\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.115\nAnd we're gonna specify what they are.\n\n221\n00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:19.019\nExcept as prescribed by the Supreme Court\nand/or under statutory authority or\n\n222\n00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:19.900\nact of Congress.\n\n223\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.940\nYou often see that a lot in these rules.\n\n224\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.040\nHey, the Supreme Court can\nalways come back through and\n\n225\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.730\ntell us by the way we're changing.\n\n226\n00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.890\nCongress can always pass a law that\nsays by the way we're gonna do this.\n\n227\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.780\nThe courts and the Congress then\nfight it out to see who's gonna win.\n\n228\n00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.900\nBut if somebody does something that trumps\nthe standing rule, we acknowledge in law\n\n229\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.500\nthat that may be the case, but otherwise\nwe follow what the standing rule is.\n\n230\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.940\nSo statements are not\nhearsay if the following.\n\n231\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.220\nLets go back to full screen cuz\nwe need to see this please.\n\n232\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.630\nSo not hearsay if any of\nthe following is true.\n\n233\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.600\nAnd we have a whole list of things\nhere that we have to be aware of.\n\n234\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.952\nA prior statement by a declarant\nwitness is made, and the declarant,\n\n235\n00:10:55.952 --> 00:11:00.158\nperson making the statement,\ntestifies at the trial or hearing and\n\n236\n00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:02.610\nis subjected to cross-examination.\n\n237\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.050\nWe see this all the time, right?\n\n238\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.890\nConcerning the statement,\nand the statement is.\n\n239\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.730\nAnd then we have a set of categorical\nitems that have to be followed.\n\n240\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.230\nSo in other words,\n\n241\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.410\njust to be clear, somebody makes\na statement in a prior venue of some kind.\n\n242\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.160\nDaniel said something two months ago\nin a conversation, in a meeting.\n\n243\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.550\nSomebody wrote that down.\n\n244\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.160\nWe're presenting that as evidence, but\n\n245\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.450\nwe're now gonna have that\nevidence called into question.\n\n246\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.220\nAnd we have to follow very\nspecific circumstances and\n\n247\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.090\nguidelines to see whether it's hearsay or\nnot.\n\n248\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.760\nThat's what we're talking about here.\n\n249\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.490\nWe can go back here please.\n\n250\n00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.630\nSo inconsistent, A, right?\n\n251\n00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.720\nInconsistent with\nthe declarant's testimony, and\n\n252\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.659\nwas given under oath subject to\nthe penalty of perjury at a trial.\n\n253\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.400\nExcuse me.\n\n254\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.030\nAt a trial, hearing, or\nother proceeding, or in a deposition.\n\n255\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.360\nSo in other words, if we have a prior\nstatement and we're now going to introduce\n\n256\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.610\nthat statement, right, at trial,\nand we are cross-examining, right?\n\n257\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.200\nSo we're challenging, in other words.\n\n258\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.240\nThat's what cross-examination is.\n\n259\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.000\nWe're subjecting that\nstatement to cross-examination\n\n260\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.940\nconcerning the statement.\n\n261\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.080\nAnd the statement is now\nfound to be inconsistent\n\n262\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.460\nwith the declarant's testimony.\n\n263\n00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.660\nIn other words,\nyou said this back two months ago,\n\n264\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.440\nnow you're saying something else.\n\n265\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.360\nWe're going to challenge the veracity,\nthe actual integrity, of that claim.\n\n266\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.841\nAnd as a result, we may allow that to be\nbrought up because it's not considered\n\n267\n00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.034\nhearsay if we're going to challenge it and\ntry to disprove it, right?\n\n268\n00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:27.317\nConsistent with the declarant's testimony\nand was offered to rebut an express or\n\n269\n00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:30.731\nimplied charge against the declarant,\nor recent fabrication or\n\n270\n00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.820\nimproper influence or motive.\n\n271\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.790\nIn other words, it is you are lying.\n\n272\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.270\nSo the first one says,\nhey, it is consistent.\n\n273\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.240\nAnd the second one says,\nhey, it is consistent.\n\n274\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.110\nYou said that two months ago,\nyou're saying it now.\n\n275\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.310\nBut we're rebutting some sort\nof statement or something that's\n\n276\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.270\nbeing brought against us so we can\nvalidate that two months ago we said that,\n\n277\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.565\nand indeed today we're standing on that.\n\n278\n00:12:48.565 --> 00:12:52.190\nBut that just proves something that\nyou're claiming I did or didn't do.\n\n279\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.215\nWe're offering that as essentially\nrebuttal to offset that.\n\n280\n00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:57.880\nC.\n\n281\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.360\nOne of identification of a person.\n\n282\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.000\nOne of identification of a person\nmade after perceiving the person.\n\n283\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.640\nIn other words, if you are offering\nthis statement and saying, yeah,\n\n284\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.315\nit was definitively so and so,\nsomebody said that they saw that person.\n\n285\n00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:12.565\nBut now that you're seeing\nthem in the court room.\n\n286\n00:13:12.565 --> 00:13:14.465\nYou see this on TV sometimes, as well.\n\n287\n00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:16.065\nLook, is so and so\nin the court room today?\n\n288\n00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:16.629\nYeah, they're there.\n\n289\n00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:21.375\nIs that the person you saw 30 nights ago\non that dark night without your glasses?\n\n290\n00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:25.405\nWell, now that I'm looking at them,\nmay not be that person, that kinda thing.\n\n291\n00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:28.160\nThat's also right where we\nmay see that introduced.\n\n292\n00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.455\nSo, we have to really walk through\nthese and dissect them and\n\n293\n00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:33.205\nunderstand them because there's\na lot of subtlety involved here.\n\n294\n00:13:33.205 --> 00:13:36.710\nA lot of, I don't want to say\ndouble-talk and things like that,\n\n295\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.930\nbut there's just a lot of complexity, as\nyou pointed out, right, to the language.\n\n296\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.184\nAnd it may be hard sometimes to understand\nwhat we're getting at as a result, right?\n\n297\n00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:47.260\nAlso, an opposing party's statement\ncan be challenged as well.\n\n298\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.720\nThe statement is offered\nagainst an opposing party and\n\n299\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.000\nis, in other words, somebody says this,\nI'm saying, no, no, no,\n\n300\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.440\nlet me challenge that,\nand I'm offering this.\n\n301\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.070\nAnd there is rules about hearsay\nevidence associated with that assertion.\n\n302\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.190\nThe statement is offered against\nthe opposing party and is,\n\n303\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.820\nand there's A B C D and E, five things.\n\n304\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.650\nParty's own statement either in\nan individual or representative capacity.\n\n305\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.240\nA statement of which the party\nhas manifested an adoption or\n\n306\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.112\nbelief in it's truth.\n\n307\n00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:14.870\nIn other words,\nI'm swearing that that is the case.\n\n308\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.400\nA statement by a person authorized\nby the party to make a statement\n\n309\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.510\nconcerning the subject.\n\n310\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.040\nI have authorized so and so in writing\nto make the statement on my behalf, and\n\n311\n00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.910\nwe're offering that.\n\n312\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.030\nAnd I can challenge that,\nthat's not considered hearsay, right?\n\n313\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.575\nSo I'm allowed to do that.\n\n314\n00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.716\nA statement by the party's agent or\nservant concerning a matter within\n\n315\n00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:34.900\nthe scope of the agency or employment made\nduring the existence of the relationship.\n\n316\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.720\nSomebody may have a valet, a driver,\nor a chauffeur or whatever and\n\n317\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.087\nmaybe they're offering\na statement adding to, or\n\n318\n00:14:41.087 --> 00:14:45.942\nsomehow explaining the statement\nthat the person on trial has made.\n\n319\n00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:49.570\nI was driving Mr Jones during\nthat time period, your honor, and\n\n320\n00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.900\nI can attest to the fact that\nhe was in the back of the car,\n\n321\n00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.810\nnot talking on a phone\nwhen he supposedly when\n\n322\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.230\nthe defendant is claiming that he\nwas having a conversation with him.\n\n323\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.220\nThat kinda thing.\n\n324\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.960\nAnd if Daniel was the driver making that\nstatement, he could be offering that.\n\n325\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.520\nIt wouldn't be considered hearsay, right,\n\n326\n00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.935\nunder this particular statute because it\nis offering an objection to an opposing\n\n327\n00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:10.040\nparty's statement that could be\nused to refute that or rebut that.\n\n328\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.160\nAnd so there are certain rules that\ncould be used in certain ways.\n\n329\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.952\nAnd a statement by a co-conspirator or\na party, this is one I love.\n\n330\n00:15:15.952 --> 00:15:16.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Co-conspirator or\n\n331\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.690\na party during the course and\nin furtherance of that conspiracy.\n\n332\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.820\nThis is where the criminals\nturn on each other, right?\n\n333\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no honor among thieves, right?\n\n334\n00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:26.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, no honor among thieves.\n\n335\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.940\nYeah, so I'm selling him out.\n\n336\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.074\nHe did that, I was there.\n\n337\n00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:30.167\nI did bad stuff too, but\n\n338\n00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:32.910\nyou shouldn't believe that I'm\nbad cuz he was really bad.\n\n339\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He did even worse things\n\n340\n00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.490\nthan me, right?\n\n341\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.660\nAnd so, there's all these reasons why we\nmay see stuff not being just hearsay but\n\n342\n00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.920\nrather be admissible under\nthe federal rules of evidence.\n\n343\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.055\nAgain I would not spend a tremendous\namount of time remembering, memorizing,\n\n344\n00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:51.282\nand in minutiae, understanding every\nminor detail of every word here, right?\n\n345\n00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:55.158\nBut what I would suggest, if you're\nplanning on preparing for CHFI exam,\n\n346\n00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:57.066\nwould be that it would be valuable for\n\n347\n00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:00.943\nyou to understand the conceptual ideas\nbehind what hearsay evidence is and\n\n348\n00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:05.338\nwhat objections may be raised To evidence,\nto either classify it as hearsay or not.\n\n349\n00:16:05.338 --> 00:16:07.930\nAnd if we're gonna allow it,\nand say it's not hearsay,\n\n350\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.850\nthere are some broad categorical\nthings that would be allowed.\n\n351\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.540\nYou should probably be familiar\nat a high level with them.\n\n352\n00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.759\nAre you gonna be asked to recite page and\n\n353\n00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.523\nverse exactly the verbatim\nlanguage of the law?\n\n354\n00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:20.963\nAbsolutely not right,\nthis is now law school,\n\n355\n00:16:20.963 --> 00:16:24.565\nyou're not being asked to pass the bar but\nyou may get some questions.\n\n356\n00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:26.820\nAre they gonna be a huge number,\nprobably not.\n\n357\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.597\nAre they enough for\nyou to judge success of failure?\n\n358\n00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:31.247\nIf you're really good at\nall of the other stuff,\n\n359\n00:16:31.247 --> 00:16:34.187\nyou may not even worry about these\nquestions, they may be irrelevant to you.\n\n360\n00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:35.177\nBut the more you get right,\n\n361\n00:16:35.177 --> 00:16:37.657\nthe less you've got to worry about,\nthat's the general rule of thumb.\n\n362\n00:16:37.657 --> 00:16:39.450\nSo you just want to make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n363\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.272\nAll right, what about rule 803?\n\n364\n00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:44.977\nHeresay exceptions,\navailability of declarant immaterial,\n\n365\n00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:47.997\nas we say, even if the declarant\nis available as a witness,\n\n366\n00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:50.650\nthe following are not\nexcluded by the hearsay rule.\n\n367\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.360\nSo even if the person making\nthe statement is available as a witness,\n\n368\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.570\nyou are not allowed to\nexclude the following items,\n\n369\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.150\nthis list of items right here,\nas heresay under the Heresay Rule.\n\n370\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.537\nPresent sense impression,\nthey stand up in court and\n\n371\n00:17:03.537 --> 00:17:06.522\nsay based on what I'm hearing and\nseeing, I'm telling you this.\n\n372\n00:17:06.522 --> 00:17:08.680\nThat's not excluded as heresay.\n\n373\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.480\nExcited utterance, they say something\nin the moment, so to speak.\n\n374\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.710\nI would have killed that\nperson if I only knew.\n\n375\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.260\nYou know, you hear that all the time.\n\n376\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.473\nWell you said you were going to kill him.\n\n377\n00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.902\nWell I didn't really mean that,\nthat was an excited utterance,\n\n378\n00:17:19.902 --> 00:17:21.450\nthat's what we would call it.\n\n379\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.680\nStatement for purposes of\nmedical diagnosis or treatment.\n\n380\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.340\nRecorded recollections, somebody makes\na note, yeah is coming up right now for\n\n381\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.630\ninstance, in the United States,\nwith this whole conversation\n\n382\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.400\nin the current round of political\ntheater that we're engaging in.\n\n383\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.670\nWith regards to whether the former\nFBI director, James Comey,\n\n384\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.040\nwill testify before congress.\n\n385\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.360\nAnd if he does, can he use his records,\nhis notes, and his memos,\n\n386\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.500\nhis recollections of the conversations\nhe supposedly had with the President,\n\n387\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.380\nwith Mr. Trump our president,\nin the oval office around this idea\n\n388\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.002\nof whether this particular investigation\nwas gonna be handled a certain way or not.\n\n389\n00:17:56.002 --> 00:17:59.110\nNobody knows what went on that\nconversation except for the two of them,\n\n390\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.300\nright, cuz they were there.\n\n391\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.570\nBut he supposedly, Mr.\n\n392\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.770\nComey made notes and now the question is,\ncan he present those notes and\n\n393\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.970\nare they gonna be considered actual and\nrepresentative or not.\n\n394\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.480\nAnd so this would be a good example of\nrecorded recollection and the ability for\n\n395\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.990\nus to present that, not as hearsay, but\nactually have it entered as potential\n\n396\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.674\nevidence because it is made by\nsomebody that was involved.\n\n397\n00:18:17.674 --> 00:18:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Would something like a diary\nalso follow under this?\n\n398\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.020\n&gt;&gt; It would, potentially,\nunder certain circumstance, again,\n\n399\n00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.520\nthere may be exceptions to these rules.\n\n400\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.220\nThe diary could have been\npotentially forged or modified.\n\n401\n00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.850\nSo we would have to ascertain and validate\nits integrity and its authenticity.\n\n402\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.130\nIf the diary was lost for two years and\nall of a sudden surfaces the day before\n\n403\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:41.010\nthe trial, it may not be seen as\nbeing legitimate, as if it was in-\n\n404\n00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.520\n&gt;&gt; Magically it appears.\n\n405\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, just magically out of the blue.\n\n406\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.660\nIt was in the possession of somebody who\nhad it, and was able to present it, and\n\n407\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.630\nit was validated forensically and found to\nnot have been modified, things like that.\n\n408\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.605\nThe handwriting is different, there's all\nthese things that could go into that.\n\n409\n00:18:55.605 --> 00:18:58.430\nBut yeah, assuming you could validate\nthe authenticity of it, a diary would be\n\n410\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.230\nconsidered a recorded, fall under that\nstatute as a recorded recollection.\n\n411\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.160\nRecords of regularly conducted activities\n\n412\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.180\nthis would be things like business\nrecords, meetings, things like that.\n\n413\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.700\nA calendar, would be a good example there.\n\n414\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.940\nAbsence of entry and records kept\nin accordance with the provisions.\n\n415\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.720\nMeaning, normally everyday, you record\nfive entries about what you did and\n\n416\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.270\nwho you talk to and all of the sudden,\nthere's a two-day gap.\n\n417\n00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.410\nThat kind of stuff, right,\nwould be suspicious and\n\n418\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.630\nwe'd be able to enter that and\nnot say it's hearsay, but rather say look,\n\n419\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.500\nthere's clearly some evidence here that\nsomebody's trying to hide something.\n\n420\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.170\nRight, and\nwe would be thinking about that.\n\n421\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.000\nPublic records and\n\n422\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.670\nreports, news clippings, things of that\nnature that are public knowledge and\n\n423\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.220\ntherefore in the public domain would be\naccessable, and therefore admissible.\n\n424\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.175\nRecords of vital statistics,\ndata on variety of things like,\n\n425\n00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:46.218\nnot that you would necessary\nenter data on the weather, right?\n\n426\n00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that may be important,\n\n427\n00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:51.860\ngiven what your doing, maybe recorded\namount of information about the weather in\n\n428\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.040\nthat particular time period, and\nhow it may have affected evidence or\n\n429\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.360\nsomething like that could be\nentered if it was important.\n\n430\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.540\nStatistical data, census data,\nthings of that nature, all sorts of stuff.\n\n431\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.480\n&gt;&gt; The thing about the weather it could\nbe that you've made a statement that\n\n432\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.220\nit was a clear night that night.\n\n433\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.770\nBut it was raining that night,\nand the statistical data shows\n\n434\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.250\nit was perfectly clear in your area,\nI don't know how you say it was raining.\n\n435\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so things of that nature, right,\ncould be gathered and could be inferred.\n\n436\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.820\nAnd none of that would be considered\nhearsay under these rules under\n\n437\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.850\nthis exception.\n\n438\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.090\nHearsay exceptions,\ndeclarant unavailable, rule 804.\n\n439\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.160\nRule 803 is the declarant is available,\nrule 804 is declarant's unavailable.\n\n440\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.480\nSame idea but, but just hey the person\nthat said it, is no longer available.\n\n441\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.670\nYou see this sometimes in TV shows, in\nmovies as well, dying utterances instance,\n\n442\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.290\nsomebody knows I'm gonna die, or\nhe's told, hey you're gonna die.\n\n443\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.932\nYou make a statement, it could be entered\ninto court later as your testimony,\n\n444\n00:20:43.932 --> 00:20:46.706\neven though you're not available for\ncross examination.\n\n445\n00:20:46.706 --> 00:20:49.758\nUnder certain circumstances, well defined,\nyou have to be told you're dying,\n\n446\n00:20:49.758 --> 00:20:51.632\nyou have to understand\nthe implications of that.\n\n447\n00:20:51.632 --> 00:20:53.981\nYou have to make a certain kind\nof statement in a certain way,\n\n448\n00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.510\nsaying I'm making this declaration.\n\n449\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.620\nIt's my dying utterance and\nI want it to be presented at\n\n450\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.760\ntrial to represent me cuz I'm not\ngonna be there, that kinda thing.\n\n451\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.900\nNot, hey, I'm just off having\na good time in the Bahamas.\n\n452\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I couldn't make it in for\n\n453\n00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:07.440\ntestimony and\nhopefully you'll extend this, right?\n\n454\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.480\nSo if you're unavailable as a witness,\nthe following are not excluded.\n\n455\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.370\nNot excluded by the Hearsay Rule.\n\n456\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.240\nFormer testimony can be introduced.\n\n457\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.060\nSo if you're not available,\n\n458\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.770\nif it's already in the record from\na prior trial, you can introduce that.\n\n459\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.450\nStatement under belief of impending death,\nthat's the one I was talking about.\n\n460\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.730\nDying utterance is sometimes\nhow you hear it referred to.\n\n461\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.080\nStatement against interests.\n\n462\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.000\nStatement of personal or family history.\n\n463\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.740\nYes my family going back ten generations\nhas always lived on this land,\n\n464\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.430\nand we've always been doing this,\nthis, this and this.\n\n465\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.870\nAnd so as a result it shouldn't be seen as\nunusual that I would continue to do this,\n\n466\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.630\nthis and this right.\n\n467\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.170\nCuz we've been doing it for\nten generations, that kinda thing.\n\n468\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.850\nAny of that, all of that would\nbe considered admissible and\n\n469\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.270\nis not gonna be hearsay.\n\n470\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.653\nBut under declarant unavailable, Rule 804.\n\n471\n00:21:51.653 --> 00:21:53.960\nWhat about content of writings,\nrecordings and photographs?\n\n472\n00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.985\nWe jump into the 1000 series of rules.\n\n473\n00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:59.589\nRule 1000, 101, 1000 and 1, excuse me.\n\n474\n00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:01.290\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of 1's and 0s.\n\n475\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.051\nThere's a lot of 1's and 0's.\n\n476\n00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:05.165\nIt's kinda like binary.\n\n477\n00:22:05.165 --> 00:22:06.923\n[LAUGH] I was gonna say the same thing.\n\n478\n00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:08.047\nOn off, on off.\n\n479\n00:22:08.047 --> 00:22:09.415\nOr on off, off, on.\n\n480\n00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:12.340\nSo under Rule 1001 definitions.\n\n481\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.832\nWritings and recordings,\nphotographs originals duplicates.\n\n482\n00:22:15.832 --> 00:22:21.255\nThis is what lays out the specificity\nof what will be considered evidence and\n\n483\n00:22:21.255 --> 00:22:23.030\nwhat can be entered.\n\n484\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.674\nWritings and recordings consists of words\nletters or numbers their equivalent set\n\n485\n00:22:26.674 --> 00:22:29.860\ndown through handwriting,\ntypewriting, printing, photostating.\n\n486\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.585\nThere's a term you don't\nhear that much anymore.\n\n487\n00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:34.819\nPhotographing, magnetic impulse,\nmechanical or electronic recording or\n\n488\n00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:36.470\nthe other forms of data compilations.\n\n489\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.109\nIn other words, according to the law,\nthese are the acceptable methodologies and\n\n490\n00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:44.292\nmechanisms for transcribing and\nor creating content and\n\n491\n00:22:44.292 --> 00:22:47.226\nhaving it be admissible as a writing or\na recording.\n\n492\n00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:49.370\nAll right, photographs.\n\n493\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.259\nPhotographs include stills, x-rays,\nvideotapes and motion pictures.\n\n494\n00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.990\nOriginal.\n\n495\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.800\nAn original of a writing or\nrecording is the writing or\n\n496\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.610\nrecording itself or\nany counterpart intended to have\n\n497\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.480\nthe same effect by the person executing or\nissuing it.\n\n498\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.250\nAnd a duplicate is a counterpart produced\nby the same impression as the original.\n\n499\n00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.100\nIn other words, made the same way by\nmeans of whatever mechanism you used,\n\n500\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.950\nas can see there, and\nthat accurately, very importantly,\n\n501\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.590\nthe technique equivalent or original\naccurately reproduces the original.\n\n502\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.790\nNow it doesn't accurately\nreproduces the original equals and\n\n503\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.660\nit says what accurately reproducing means.\n\n504\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.030\nIt simply says accurately reproduces.\n\n505\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.610\nThis may be open to interpretation.\n\n506\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.330\nThe judge may say, you know, based on\nmodern technology and the fact that we did\n\n507\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.650\na bit by bit comparison, and\nwe can see clearly that bits number 5 and\n\n508\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.950\n7 are not the same,\nmaybe it's not an accurate reproduction.\n\n509\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.460\nBut maybe 30 years ago before we had\nthis technology it would have been,\n\n510\n00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.910\nhard to say, so\nthere is some gray area here, right?\n\n511\n00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.138\nAnd we have to understand that this can\nbe open to the interpretation of a judge.\n\n512\n00:23:49.138 --> 00:23:53.388\nThis is why we have appeals, this is why\ncourts are constantly deciding things and\n\n513\n00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:57.588\nthen getting reversed later, and cases\nare tried in the moment and are based on.\n\n514\n00:23:57.588 --> 00:24:00.270\nTypically a historical precedence of law.\n\n515\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.170\nBut they can be open to challenges,\nbased on new technologies and techniques.\n\n516\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:08.411\nRemember, DNA for instance [CROSSTALK] in\nour area, changed the way that criminal\n\n517\n00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:11.619\ncases have been tried,\nnot just in US, but around the world.\n\n518\n00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:15.782\nBut yet, before the advent of DNA,\nyou could have been found innocent guilty,\n\n519\n00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:18.972\nbut it would've been based on\ndifferent kinds of evidence.\n\n520\n00:24:18.972 --> 00:24:22.293\nAnd a lot of people are found guilty,\nthrough the Innocence Project and\n\n521\n00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:24.910\nother projects like that,\nwere later found innocent.\n\n522\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.153\nWhen DNA testing became realistic and\navailable, and\n\n523\n00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:29.064\nwere found to not to\nhave committed the crime.\n\n524\n00:24:29.064 --> 00:24:32.858\nEven though circumstantial evidence\npointed to the fact that they were guilty\n\n525\n00:24:32.858 --> 00:24:35.625\nin the eyes of the law, but\nmaintained their innocence.\n\n526\n00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:38.147\nDNA evidence showing that it could\nnot have possibly been them,\n\n527\n00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:38.991\nthey were not there.\n\n528\n00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:41.313\n&gt;&gt; Watch Making a Murderer,\nand [CROSSTALK]\n\n529\n00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.989\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, fabricating it, yeah,\n\n530\n00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:45.864\njust [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, he was in jail for 18 years.\n\n531\n00:24:45.864 --> 00:24:47.909\nAnd then the Innocence Project\ncomes around, and\n\n532\n00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:50.060\nthey find out through DNA\nevidence he's innocent.\n\n533\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.252\nAnd now he's back in jail for\nanother murder, it's crazy,\n\n534\n00:24:53.252 --> 00:24:55.295\nit's a compelling show though, enjoy.\n\n535\n00:24:55.295 --> 00:24:59.792\nBut all about that whole entire thing,\nright, what was good evidence at that time\n\n536\n00:24:59.792 --> 00:25:01.216\nis no longer-\n&gt;&gt; It's considered-\n\n537\n00:25:01.216 --> 00:25:01.909\n&gt;&gt; Good evidence, and\n\n538\n00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:03.302\nit changed the whole situation, yeah.\n\n539\n00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:05.669\n&gt;&gt; Right, because now,\nDNA is the standard and\n\n540\n00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:08.880\nfirst line,\naccepted way of presenting this evidence.\n\n541\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.004\nWhereas other evidence is frowned on now,\nbecause it's not as authoritative, and\n\n542\n00:25:13.004 --> 00:25:14.172\ntherefore not as sure.\n\n543\n00:25:14.172 --> 00:25:15.581\n&gt;&gt; What was interesting,\n\n544\n00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:20.449\nwas that it actually overturned the\neyewitness testimony of the victim, right?\n\n545\n00:25:20.449 --> 00:25:25.145\nOf the victim who said, yes, that is the\nman, and the DNA evidence said, no, well,\n\n546\n00:25:25.145 --> 00:25:26.134\nyou got it wrong.\n\n547\n00:25:26.134 --> 00:25:26.999\nIt just goes to show you,\n\n548\n00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:29.710\nthat eyewitness testimony [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Eyewitness testimony is actually\n\n549\n00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.145\nhistorically shown to be sketchy.\n\n550\n00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:35.965\nAnd it's considered to be, although we\noften put a lot of stock in the fact that\n\n551\n00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:39.705\nthe eyewitness would\nauthoritatively identify somebody.\n\n552\n00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:43.142\nStudies have shown, and\nit's a known fact in criminalistics,\n\n553\n00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:45.230\nthat eyewitnesses are not reliable.\n\n554\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.528\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; That they will have a lot of\n\n555\n00:25:46.528 --> 00:25:48.754\ndifferent interpretations\nto what happened.\n\n556\n00:25:48.754 --> 00:25:50.865\nBut as you put their stories together,\nthere's so\n\n557\n00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:53.320\nmuch inconsistency that\npeople will fill in gaps.\n\n558\n00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:53.970\nAnd see things,\n\n559\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.300\nand think things that probably did\nnot happen, more often do not.\n\n560\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.250\nSo yeah, when they do things like\nterrorism investigation, stuff like that.\n\n561\n00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.544\nNotoriously, unfortunately, unreliable\nto rely on eyewitness testimony.\n\n562\n00:26:04.544 --> 00:26:07.964\nSo it's part of the process, you'll\nuse it to eliminate certain things and\n\n563\n00:26:07.964 --> 00:26:08.827\nvalidate others.\n\n564\n00:26:08.827 --> 00:26:11.540\nBut historically,\nit's not the primary evidence we go to.\n\n565\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.304\nAll right, going back here, cuz we do\nneed to finish up this conversation.\n\n566\n00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:17.642\nRule 1002, Requirement of Original,\nyou could see it there.\n\n567\n00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:20.897\nTo prove the content of writing, recording\na photograph, the original writing,\n\n568\n00:26:20.897 --> 00:26:22.395\nas we talked about, needs to be used.\n\n569\n00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:24.520\nWe talked about the Requirement\nof the Original earlier.\n\n570\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.302\nAdmissibility of Duplicates, we've\ntalked a little about this, Rule 1003.\n\n571\n00:26:28.302 --> 00:26:32.830\nWhen a duplicate can be administered,\nor used as admissible evidence.\n\n572\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.305\nIt's admissible,\nto the same extent as the original,\n\n573\n00:26:35.305 --> 00:26:37.895\nunless a genuine question is\nraised about authenticity.\n\n574\n00:26:37.895 --> 00:26:41.230\nOr in circumstances where it would be\nunfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of\n\n575\n00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.377\nthe original.\n\n576\n00:26:42.377 --> 00:26:45.406\nThat's rare, but\ncertain situations where you may say, hey,\n\n577\n00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:48.057\nthere are only five known\ncopies of this thing to exist.\n\n578\n00:26:48.057 --> 00:26:50.273\nYou're claiming to have a sixth,\nnobody's validated it.\n\n579\n00:26:50.273 --> 00:26:52.856\nThat duplicate may not be\nconsidered to be authentic, and\n\n580\n00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:54.237\ntherefore may not be allowed.\n\n581\n00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:56.477\nAnd that's the kind of thing\nthat you have to think about.\n\n582\n00:26:56.477 --> 00:26:59.126\nAdmissibility of other Evidence\nof Content, Rule 1004.\n\n583\n00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:03.754\nThe original is not required,\nother evidence of the contents of writing,\n\n584\n00:27:03.754 --> 00:27:06.483\nrecording or photograph is admissible if.\n\n585\n00:27:06.483 --> 00:27:09.350\nIf we can go back to full-screen here,\nso we can see this, please.\n\n586\n00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.473\nYou will see, originals are lost or\ndestroyed, we talked about that.\n\n587\n00:27:12.473 --> 00:27:14.326\nOriginals not obtainable, right?\n\n588\n00:27:14.326 --> 00:27:17.379\nYou're not bringing the original\nDeclaration of Independence into a court\n\n589\n00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:18.482\nof law, not gonna happen.\n\n590\n00:27:18.482 --> 00:27:21.430\nThey're not giving you the Mona Lisa\nto bring it into a trial, right, so-\n\n591\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Highly unlikely.\n\n592\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.247\n&gt;&gt; Highly unlikely, that's, you may not\nbe able to obtain it, and as a result,\n\n593\n00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:28.737\nright, you may have to\npresent something else.\n\n594\n00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:30.687\nOriginal in possession of opponent, right.\n\n595\n00:27:30.687 --> 00:27:34.445\nSo may not be possible,\nbecause somebody else may own it, and\n\n596\n00:27:34.445 --> 00:27:37.230\nthey may be counter to your interests.\n\n597\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.740\nCollateral matters, so writing,\n\n598\n00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.824\nrecording or photograph is not closely\nrelated to a controlling issue.\n\n599\n00:27:41.824 --> 00:27:45.713\nMeaning, it may not be pertinent to\nwhat we are doing specifically, and\n\n600\n00:27:45.713 --> 00:27:47.582\nthe original may not be required.\n\n601\n00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:50.594\nAnd therefore, we could substitute\nsomething that is an approximation, but\n\n602\n00:27:50.594 --> 00:27:51.469\nmaybe more relevant.\n\n603\n00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:55.508\nSo just be aware of that, but these\nare all the federal rules of evidence,\n\n604\n00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:58.915\nexcuse me, that we focus on, and\nthat we want to take note of.\n\n605\n00:27:58.915 --> 00:28:02.157\nI told you we could get in done within\nthe timeframe alloted for one cycle.\n\n606\n00:28:02.157 --> 00:28:03.098\nAnd you can see by Mr.\n\n607\n00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.670\nClock on the wall there, who just ticked\ndown to zero, that we hit our mark.\n\n608\n00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:07.997\n&gt;&gt; Adam, you were-\n&gt;&gt; I have nothing more to say.\n\n609\n00:28:07.997 --> 00:28:10.010\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes the man is good, right?\n\n610\n00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.730\nThat is a good thing, but\nwe do have a bit more to go through.\n\n611\n00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:13.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a bit more.\n\n612\n00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:16.557\n&gt;&gt; We're almost at the finish line, ladies\nand gentlemen, definitely join us back,\n\n613\n00:28:16.557 --> 00:28:17.719\nwe've got a part five for you.\n\n614\n00:28:17.719 --> 00:28:19.483\nTo round out this conversation,\n\n615\n00:28:19.483 --> 00:28:22.948\ntalking about the state of digital\nforensics in today's world.\n\n616\n00:28:22.948 --> 00:28:26.268\nIt's been a very interesting and\ncompelling conversation so far, so\n\n617\n00:28:26.268 --> 00:28:27.007\njoin us again.\n\n618\n00:28:27.007 --> 00:28:28.739\nAdam, I'm looking

said by taking you\n\n15\n00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:41.466\non a little trip out to the Web.\n\n16\n00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.250\nWe often try to do this\non many of our shows,\n\n17\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.740\nshow you some resources that\nmay be valuable for you.\n\n18\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.560\nSo a really cool one out there\na lot of people don't know about,\n\n19\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.300\nespecially if you're new to this\nparticular side of the industry.\n\n20\n00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.250\nBut it is really cool.\n\n21\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.040\nAnd you actually Daniel may like\nthis as well I don't know if you're\n\n22\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.770\nfamiliar with this either.\n\n23\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.740\nIf you wanna join me here on the veranda\nwe'll have a cool sip of digital forensics\n\n24\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.000\nin magazine/digital form.\n\n25\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.514\nBut one of the really cool\nresources out there for\n\n26\n00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:06.900\nour little sector of the industry out\nhere, The Digital Forensics Magazine.\n\n27\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.125\nYou may wanna take a look at that at some\npoint, digitaforensicsmagazine.com, and\n\n28\n00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.833\nyou could read it online,\nyou could subscribed to it.\n\n29\n00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:17.746\nThis particular issue is all about vehicle\nforensics, really cool, little subset,\n\n30\n00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:20.790\nan area there and you can get in and\ntake a look at all sorts of stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.785\nBut, they got a lot really cool\nstuff going on on this website and\n\n32\n00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.540\nwill be good to set up resources for you.\n\n33\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.790\nJust take a look at,\nthey've also got your new items here,\n\n34\n00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.148\nthey've got events and things like that.\n\n35\n00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.560\nSo, you could find out stuff\nabout the industry in general and\n\n36\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.285\njust keep up on it.\n\n37\n00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.570\nJust many, many things out there but\n\n38\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.848\nthis particular one happens to have\na lot of really good information.\n\n39\n00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:47.102\nSo in addition, the Scientific Working\nGroup on Digital Evidence, SWGDE.\n\n40\n00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:52.006\nThis is gonna bring together organizations\nthat are actively engaged in the field\n\n41\n00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.783\nof digital and multimedia forensics and\nevidence gathering.\n\n42\n00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.962\nAs you can see over here,\nit is an internationally acknowledged and\n\n43\n00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:01.864\nreputable organization that is\nlooked to to set standards and\n\n44\n00:02:01.864 --> 00:02:04.176\nto provide guidance for\npeople in our industry.\n\n45\n00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:06.494\nSo again, something you may or\nmay not be aware of but\n\n46\n00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:09.618\nyou definitely wanna take a look at and\nspend a little time with there.\n\n47\n00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:13.465\nThey do have all sorts of documents\navailable here, they do have events,\n\n48\n00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:17.454\nyou can join them, they're involved\nin legislative activities, right?\n\n49\n00:02:17.454 --> 00:02:19.668\nSo there's a lot of\ninteresting stuff they do.\n\n50\n00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.739\nThe FBI, as in the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation on the United States, has\n\n51\n00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.202\nissued and taken the scientific working\ngroup on digital evidences information,\n\n52\n00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:35.369\nand created the international organization\non digital evidence, the IOCE.\n\n53\n00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.212\nThe principles are built\noff of the WSJDE work and\n\n54\n00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:44.087\nhave created a set of standards\nthat are used as principles for\n\n55\n00:02:44.087 --> 00:02:47.012\nthe gathering of digital evidence.\n\n56\n00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:50.808\nYou can see them and they are listed\na little bit about them here.\n\n57\n00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:52.668\nSo I just thought I'd\nshow you the site and\n\n58\n00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:54.430\nkinda give you a sense of what they are.\n\n59\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.318\nThe principles are listed here,\na little bit easier for\n\n60\n00:02:57.318 --> 00:03:01.067\nyou to see them right here and to take\na look at then we'll go full screen so\n\n61\n00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:03.177\nyou can take a look and see what they are.\n\n62\n00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:06.374\nBut the IOCE International Principles for\nDigital Evidence again,\n\n63\n00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:09.680\nsomething that if you're planning on\ntaking an exam would be useful for\n\n64\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.673\nyou to have a little bit of knowledge and\nto be just to be aware of.\n\n65\n00:03:12.673 --> 00:03:15.906\nYou could see principle number one\nwhen dealing with digital evidence,\n\n66\n00:03:15.906 --> 00:03:19.230\nall of the general forensic procedure\nprinciples must be applied.\n\n67\n00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.060\nWe keep coming back to this idea over and\nover again of rules of evidence,\n\n68\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.390\nchain of custody, following the standards\nof our particular rules of engagement or\n\n69\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.200\nstandards that are regulatory or\nstatutory in compliance requirements and\n\n70\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.240\njust paying attention to the rules and\nbeing methodical.\n\n71\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.070\nYou'll see that everywhere you go,\neverything we talk about always starts out\n\n72\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.880\nwith some sort of reference and\nnod to this idea.\n\n73\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.000\nIt's very fundamental,\nit's very important, and\n\n74\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.040\nyou should always remember and\nmake sure you are aware of the fact\n\n75\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.240\nthat this is one of the guiding\nprinciples of digital forensics.\n\n76\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.770\nUpon seizing digital evidence,\nactions as you could see should\n\n77\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.090\nactions taken should not change\nthe evidence in any way.\n\n78\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.170\nWe know about that,\nwe've talked about that as well.\n\n79\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.121\nWhen it is necessary for a person to\naccess original digital evidence,\n\n80\n00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.508\nthat person needs to be trained.\n\n81\n00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:06.946\nIn other words you should not let\npeople that don't have proper forensics\n\n82\n00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.617\ntraining interact with evidence.\n\n83\n00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:12.250\nThat leads to just bad outcomes and\nthat would be something we wanna avoid.\n\n84\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.390\nAll activities relating to seizure,\naccess, storage, or transfer\n\n85\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.800\nof evidence need to be fully documented,\npreserved, and available for review.\n\n86\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.380\nThere's our chain of custody\nstatement right there.\n\n87\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.010\nAn individual responsible for all actions\ntaken with respect to digital evidence,\n\n88\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.880\nwhile the digital evidence\nis in their possession.\n\n89\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.320\nWhoever owns the digital evidence, whoever\nhas it in their position is responsible\n\n90\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.950\nfor the safe keeping and\nmaintenance of it and\n\n91\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.360\nthe maintenance of the integrity\naround it while they are using it.\n\n92\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.980\nAny agency that's responsible for\nseizing access, and storing, or\n\n93\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.798\ntransferring evidence is responsible for\ncompliance with these principles, right?\n\n94\n00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:46.820\nIn other words, we have to make\nsure that we understand that there\n\n95\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.850\nare rules of engagement and that whether\nwe're an organization, an individual we're\n\n96\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.860\nrepresenting one or the other, we have\nto act in accordance with those rules.\n\n97\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.780\nSo amateurs need not apply,\nis what we would often say.\n\n98\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.930\nSo be aware of that.\n\n99\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.400\nThe other thing I wanted to point to you,\nhere I have another list of thing,\n\n100\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.980\njust put it up here for you that we\ntalk about forensic readiness and\n\n101\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.640\nforensic readiness planning.\n\n102\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.470\nForensic readiness is the idea\nof the organization's ability to\n\n103\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.290\nbe able to really get behind the use of,\nand the methodology, and\n\n104\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.613\nthe implementation methodology around\nthe use of the rules of the evidence and\n\n105\n00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:22.130\ncreation of assimilation of that knowledge\nso that they can plan accordingly.\n\n106\n00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.490\nPlanning around that puts process,\nprocedure and policy in places to maintain\n\n107\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.615\nforensic readiness and helps to establish\nand to do with the things on this list,\n\n108\n00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:34.515\nyou'll see here identifying\nthe potential evidence required for\n\n109\n00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:38.505\nan incident determining the source or\nsources of evidence.\n\n110\n00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.965\nDefining policies that\nwill help us to understand\n\n111\n00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:45.310\nhow to legally act in such a way that\nthat information will be usable and\n\n112\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.030\npotentially be credible\nbefore a court of law.\n\n113\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.790\nEstablish policies for\nsecurely handling and\n\n114\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.840\nstoring the information and the evidence.\n\n115\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.940\nIdentify if the incident requires a full\nor formal investigative process and\n\n116\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.780\nif so, carry that out.\n\n117\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.070\nTrain your staff accordingly to handle\nthe incident and preserve the evidence.\n\n118\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.840\nVery important to be able to do that.\n\n119\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.420\nMaking sure that we'll create a special\nprocess for documenting everything we do.\n\n120\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.920\nAnd establish a legal advisory board to\nguide the investigative process when and\n\n121\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.990\nwhere appropriate.\n\n122\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.590\nSo forensic theat in this planning\nhelps us to achieve these things.\n\n123\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.085\nWe also need to ensure and remind\nourselves the fact that computer forensics\n\n124\n00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:21.385\nand I talked about this\none in the prior episodes.\n\n125\n00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:24.944\nIt's part of incident response overall,\nnumber of incident responses\n\n126\n00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:28.872\ntypically the larger container that we\nput computer forensics up underneath.\n\n127\n00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:32.508\nWe use computer forensics as a tool and\napproach methodology within\n\n128\n00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:36.260\nthe broader context of incidence\nresponse when appropriate.\n\n129\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.750\nA lot of incident response has nothing\nto do with computer forensics, but\n\n130\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.160\na lot may depending on\nthe nature of the incidents.\n\n131\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.610\nJust be aware of that.\n\n132\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.340\nAnd digital evidence and\nthe examination process of it.\n\n133\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.130\nThere's a multi step methodology here and\nI just wanna walk us through this as we\n\n134\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.300\nwrap up our conversations,\njust to make sure we're clear\n\n135\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.020\nas we go forward looking into additional\ntopics we'll take on in upcoming episodes.\n\n136\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.390\nThat we have a process.\n\n137\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.550\nWe'll want to be able to understand and\nfollow that.\n\n138\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.410\nEvidence assessment.\n\n139\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.250\nWe should be thinking about the fact that\nwe have to scope and tailor, filter and\n\n140\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.280\nunderstand what evidence will and\nwill not be appropriate.\n\n141\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.460\nWe've talked about things like hearsay\nexceptions and whether stuff is in or\n\n142\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.210\nout based on where it comes from and\nhow it is gathered.\n\n143\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.140\nSo we have to think about\nevidence assessment and\n\n144\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.920\nweighing the ability to understand\nwhether evidence would be allowed.\n\n145\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.240\nEvidence acquisition what was or\nis the role of the system.\n\n146\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.070\nSo where do we get the evidence from and\nwhat condition is the system.\n\n147\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.340\nAre we doing imaging and or\nif we are Making bit stream copies.\n\n148\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.390\nAre we using right protection?\n\n149\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.290\nWe talked about this.\n\n150\n00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.720\nWe have to completely document\nall evidence that is gathered,\n\n151\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.750\nchain of custody, and\nlife cycle validation.\n\n152\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.030\nStorage device examinations,\nwhich are all space is accounted for.\n\n153\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.170\nWe have to make sure we look at\nwhite space or slack space areas,\n\n154\n00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.180\nwhere data may hide.\n\n155\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.220\nWe'll talk more about this\nin upcoming conversations.\n\n156\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.260\nUsing logs and the use of logs Why\nthey're so important to authoritatively\n\n157\n00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.050\ngive us a visibility window into what may\nhave happened at a certain moment in time.\n\n158\n00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.090\nRemember, logs are date and time stamped.\n\n159\n00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.040\nAnd it's important to understand what was\nhappening at a certain point in order to\n\n160\n00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.450\ncross reference activities with things\nthat we can see that will validate or\n\n161\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.580\nperhaps disprove that\nsomebody claimed something.\n\n162\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.580\nDaniel talked about in the last episode,\nwhere we were talking about evidence\n\n163\n00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.490\nthat may or may not be missable\nvital statistics, things like that.\n\n164\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.880\nHey, maybe it was raining on that night.\n\n165\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.790\nMaybe it wasn't.\n\n166\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.680\nYou may be able to introduce evidence\nabout the weather if we say it was\n\n167\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.030\na clear, brightly lit night, and\nthere was no moon out, and it was raining.\n\n168\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.955\nWe could disprove that statement and\nthen maybe therefore cast a shadow\n\n169\n00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:31.205\non that testimony and disprove that\nwhat you're saying is true or not true.\n\n170\n00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:33.065\nSo wanna be able to look\nat stuff like that.\n\n171\n00:08:33.065 --> 00:08:38.680\nMemory, processes and caches, places where\ndynamic data and residual data may hide.\n\n172\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.690\nIn looking at all of that and\n\n173\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.380\nunderstanding where we can gather\nevidence from and all the places,\n\n174\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.970\nthe nooks and crannies,\nthe little dark corners of the system and\n\n175\n00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.825\nthe network at large where evidence may\nlay and we sort of have to go find it.\n\n176\n00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:55.985\nIt's very critical for the investigator to\nbe able to knowledgable about these things\n\n177\n00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.945\nand understand what we should and\nindeed will be looking at and\n\n178\n00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:02.165\nalso what maybe just distracted, right?\n\n179\n00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:03.795\nWhat maybe evidence\nreally is not evidence,\n\n180\n00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:06.002\nstuff that just should not be considered.\n\n181\n00:09:06.002 --> 00:09:09.432\nIt's not tangential in any way, or\nrelated in anyway to the conversation,\n\n182\n00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:10.522\nwe should exclude it.\n\n183\n00:09:10.522 --> 00:09:12.782\nWe have to be able to filter\nthat stuff accordingly.\n\n184\n00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:14.042\nEvidence preservation, right?\n\n185\n00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:17.092\nWe need to make sure that we\nare following the rules of evidence,\n\n186\n00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.781\nestablishing chains of custody,\nwe talked about.\n\n187\n00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.031\nAbout.\nDo no harm right, as we talked about.\n\n188\n00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.861\nMaking sure we document everything.\n\n189\n00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:28.691\nMaking sure any, and every step we take\nwill at best be neutrally impactful.\n\n190\n00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.861\nMeaning we're not gonna in any way modify,\nor change evidence.\n\n191\n00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:35.165\nWe are not we're not going to impact\nit in a negative way by changing or\n\n192\n00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.495\nmodifying it would equal negative impact.\n\n193\n00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:39.985\nWe're not going to distribute and or\n\n194\n00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:44.615\ndisrupt any ongoing investigations and\nnew evidence can be introduced, but\n\n195\n00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:48.442\nonly given certain parameters,\nonly with certain rules applied.\n\n196\n00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:51.032\nAnd we're not gonna allow\nevidence to be handled or\n\n197\n00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:53.342\nmodified in any way that\nwould cast down on it.\n\n198\n00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.622\nSo we have to make sure that we're\nthinking about those things.\n\n199\n00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:57.876\nEvidence examination analysis, right?\n\n200\n00:09:57.876 --> 00:09:59.366\nNothing original I say there.\n\n201\n00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.856\nWe never touch anything original.\n\n202\n00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:04.546\nWe talk about using only copies that\nhave integrity associated with them\n\n203\n00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:05.846\nthrough a hashing mechanism.\n\n204\n00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:08.296\nIt's very important for\nus to refer to that and be aware of that.\n\n205\n00:10:08.296 --> 00:10:10.946\nThere are different types\nof data extraction.\n\n206\n00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:15.780\nWe have to understand that the way we get\ndata out of a system It is very important\n\n207\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.740\nthe methodologies involved may or\nmay not validate the data and\n\n208\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.660\nallow us to claim the data is\nauthentic and therefore usable.\n\n209\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.450\nWe have to be very careful about this.\n\n210\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.040\nAll physical systems and\nphysical extraction of data from systems\n\n211\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.790\nwe may look for and search for\nthings using keyword searches.\n\n212\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.980\nDoing what's called file carving,\n\n213\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.990\nremoving certain files and\nmetadata associated with it.\n\n214\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.560\nMay look at the physical partition\nstructure of the hard drive\n\n215\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.800\nusing tools to examine the geometry of\nthe hard drive, things of that nature.\n\n216\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.370\nLooking for what we call slack space or\n\n217\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.500\nwhite space,\nareas in the hard drive where we may have,\n\n218\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.280\non the surface, seen no data and may have\nno indication of anything being there.\n\n219\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.480\nBut upon further examination, we may find\nthat the geometry of the drive has been\n\n220\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.940\nmodified and there's actually\nspace where data may hide.\n\n221\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.760\nBut it may not be available unless we\nactually have the proper way or mechanism\n\n222\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.830\nor tools to visualize that and looking at\nthe drive map may allow us to do that.\n\n223\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.370\nLogical.\n\n224\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.630\nWe may be able to use OS\noperating system dependent tools.\n\n225\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.880\nBe able to extract file system\ninformation, think of Neda data.\n\n226\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.172\nThings like structure, attributes, names,\ndate and time stamps, file locations,\n\n227\n00:11:21.172 --> 00:11:23.321\nthings like that would\nfall into play here.\n\n228\n00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:26.961\nWe may have the ability to look at\ndata reduction, identifying and\n\n229\n00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:30.345\neliminating known files through\ncomparison of hash values.\n\n230\n00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:33.074\nIs this file the same file\nthat was there a month ago?\n\n231\n00:11:33.074 --> 00:11:34.989\nLooks like the hash is different,\nmaybe not.\n\n232\n00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:36.951\nRight, so\nmaybe able to do stuff like that.\n\n233\n00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:41.261\nExtraction of files that allow to\nable to go through and examine them,\n\n234\n00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:45.221\nlooking at file header,\nfile content, location on the drive.\n\n235\n00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:47.765\nA lot of times we'll look at a file and\nwe'll just bring it up and\n\n236\n00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:50.457\nwe don't really think about all\nthe metadata associated with it.\n\n237\n00:11:50.457 --> 00:11:54.930\nBut there's so much additional\ninformation that could be extracted and\n\n238\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.551\nexamined through the logical information\nand the GUIs that are provided,\n\n239\n00:11:59.551 --> 00:12:05.140\nGUI being user interface, the interactive\ninterface that we often think about.\n\n240\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.520\nAnd as a result of that, allowing us\nto see that in a certain way given\n\n241\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.340\nthe constraints of that interface and then\nactually examining it at the base level.\n\n242\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.390\nSo a lot of times in the GUI,\n\n243\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.650\nthe graphical user interface, we're\nrestricted from seeing certain things.\n\n244\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.780\nCertain attributes are not available,\nthey're hidden.\n\n245\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.588\nCertain metadata may or\nmay not present itself.\n\n246\n00:12:22.588 --> 00:12:25.762\nWhen we look at data from a command\nline using a non GUI based tool,\n\n247\n00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:27.667\nyou may see a very different story, and\n\n248\n00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:31.923\na compelling story about the data that may\nchange it's value and its interpretation.\n\n249\n00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:35.166\nAnd we have to be open to the idea as\ninvestigators that things are not always\n\n250\n00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.207\nwhat they appear to be.\n\n251\n00:12:36.207 --> 00:12:39.600\nAnd as a result of that we have to be\nable to understand that there may be\n\n252\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.825\ninformation lurking in the shadows and\nfind ways to extract and recover that.\n\n253\n00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:48.095\nRecovery of deleted files, password\nprotected, encrypted, and compressed data.\n\n254\n00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:52.145\nFile slack, the light space and slack\nspace we talked about, unallocated space.\n\n255\n00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:55.675\nAnd in all these areas are gonna be\nimportant for us to think about.\n\n256\n00:12:55.675 --> 00:12:58.415\nAnd the ability to document and\nreport that evidence,\n\n257\n00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:00.635\nultimately, in a compelling form.\n\n258\n00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:04.225\nAnd a word about evidence documentation,\nreporting very important for\n\n259\n00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:07.330\nus to understand the concept\nof audience relevancy.\n\n260\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.597\nIf you are producing a report\nthat is gonna be given to,\n\n261\n00:13:10.597 --> 00:13:13.700\nlet's say theoretically, senior managers.\n\n262\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.400\nMaybe mid-level to C-level\nexecutives in a business.\n\n263\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.800\nThis is perhaps an internal investigation,\nan administrative case of some kind and\n\n264\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.610\nyou are being asked to produce\ninformation about such and such or so and\n\n265\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.640\nso's activities.\n\n266\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.690\nAnd this is gonna go\nback to senior managers.\n\n267\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.810\nYou're not going to write a very\ntechnically heavy, very technically\n\n268\n00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.510\ndetailed, kind of Uber geek like\nreport because the senior managers and\n\n269\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.315\nleaders are probably not gonna\nwanna see that level of detail.\n\n270\n00:13:39.315 --> 00:13:42.155\nThey're probably gonna\nwanna highly summarized\n\n271\n00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:46.875\nhigh level version of the technical\ndetail, recommendations of findings and\n\n272\n00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:50.185\nspecificity that may indicate guilt or\ninnocence one way or the other and\n\n273\n00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:54.750\nperhaps a recommended path forward that\nthey can create actionable items from.\n\n274\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.980\nBut if you're briefing\na technical specialist,\n\n275\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.896\nthey're gonna want that level of detail.\n\n276\n00:13:58.896 --> 00:14:00.396\nIf you're briefing a defense or\n\n277\n00:14:00.396 --> 00:14:04.563\na prosecuting attorney, they're gonna want\nlots of different levels of detail because\n\n278\n00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:07.968\nthey wanna be able to tell different\npieces of the story different ways.\n\n279\n00:14:07.968 --> 00:14:12.456\nAnd they may ask questions or present your\nfindings to technical experts who will\n\n280\n00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:16.878\nthen ask questions to further flesh out\nthose details so they can present them in\n\n281\n00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:20.838\nsome sort of of a way or a methodical\nway at trial right to tell or disprove\n\n282\n00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:25.620\ncertain stories that they wanna bring to\nthe attention of the judge or the jury.\n\n283\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.530\nSo evidence documentation reporting\nis a subset of skills and\n\n284\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.750\nan art in of itself in many respects for\nwhat we do.\n\n285\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.480\nAnd this is the place where a lot\nof times the forensic investigator\n\n286\n00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.420\nmay not necessarily have the ability\nto understand the different\n\n287\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.030\naudiences that they may have to address.\n\n288\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.430\nOr they think they can create one report\nthat will essentially speak to everybody.\n\n289\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.660\nBut you may have to write different\nreports for different audiences.\n\n290\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.600\nSo It is important to\nkeep that in mind and\n\n291\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.060\nthink about the logic of audience\nrelevancy as we present our data.\n\n292\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.390\nIt becomes a very important part of how\nwe stand or fall, creates success or\n\n293\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.809\nfailure based on all the hard work we did.\n\n294\n00:15:00.809 --> 00:15:03.775\nYou could have all the answers to all\nthe questions in the report right, but\n\n295\n00:15:03.775 --> 00:15:07.072\nif you're presenting them in a way that is\nobtuse and just really not functional for\n\n296\n00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.024\nthe audience,\nthey may never understand that.\n\n297\n00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:11.976\nThey may not understand the logic of\nwhat you've done even though it may be\n\n298\n00:15:11.976 --> 00:15:12.910\nbrilliant work.\n\n299\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.830\nYou may have actually found the right\nanswers, but it may not be obvious, and\n\n300\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.440\nthat may be a problem.\n\n301\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.540\n&gt;&gt; You'll know when that's happening\nwhen you're presenting your case and\n\n302\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.270\neverybody's just like hm, hm,\n\n303\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.490\nand they get that glazed over look,\nyou know you've gone down the wrong pipe.\n\n304\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.350\nYou need to back up, reformulate,\nand reconstitute out so\n\n305\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.250\nthat they can understand.\n\n306\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.310\nCuz like you said, If you're giving\nsomeone information that they have no idea\n\n307\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.890\nwhat you're talking about, you're not\ngonna make a compelling case to them, and\n\n308\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.360\nthat's what it's all about is presenting a\ncase in a way in people can understand it.\n\n309\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I do a lot of speaking,\ndo a lot of teaching, things like that.\n\n310\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.220\nFor years, my [INAUDIBLE] test has\nbeen when the phones come out.\n\n311\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:49.790\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n312\n00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.600\n&gt;&gt; If somebody's head's down,\ndoing something else,\n\n313\n00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.090\nI know I've lost them in a meeting.\n\n314\n00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.280\nIf they're on their phones,\nI know I've lost them.\n\n315\n00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.140\nI'm speaking over the heads of my\naudience, and I'm not speaking to them.\n\n316\n00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.574\nI've speaking above them,\nand they just disengage.\n\n317\n00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:03.570\nSo you have to be very attuned to that,\nand really understand that.\n\n318\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.652\nBecause if people are getting what you're\nsaying and essentially are connecting with\n\n319\n00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:09.016\nit, they're gonna stay engaged\nthey're gonna be interested and\n\n320\n00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:12.056\nthey're gonna obviously have things that\nthey wanna glean from that presentation so\n\n321\n00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:13.290\nthey're gonna pay attention.\n\n322\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.960\nSo it is important for you to think about\nthat as we wrap up our conversation.\n\n323\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.500\nHere.\n\n324\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.420\nSo begin really to put to bed\nthis initial set of conversation,\n\n325\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.170\ninitial set of episodes around\nthe state of forensics today.\n\n326\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.240\nA lot of the ground work,\n\n327\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.260\nas we suggested through out\nthe first four, now five I think.\n\n328\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.760\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah five.\n\n329\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.890\n&gt;&gt; Episodes we've done.\n\n330\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.750\nReally just to put down\na lot of the themes and\n\n331\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.100\nideas that we're then going to develope\ninto the full blown sets of episodes and\n\n332\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.250\nconcepts, as well as\nhands on demonstrations.\n\n333\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.400\nOf a lot of these tools and concepts\nthroughout the rest of our time together.\n\n334\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, I'd say you masterfully\nhandled that, we appreciate your\n\n335\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.530\nknowledge on this here topic so that\nwe might assimilate that for ourselves.\n\n336\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.620\nWe do have to lay that foundational\nknowledge for all of us so we can speak\n\n337\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.840\nthe same language, have the same terms and\nunderstanding, so that as we move forward,\n\n338\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.660\neverything Does make sense and a very,\nvery well rounded discussion here.\n\n339\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.340\nDefinitely take some time to go back\nover and understand the concepts.\n\n340\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.080\nMaybe if you maybe understood, but\nnot quite to the depth that you need to,\n\n341\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.660\njust make sure you go back\nover these things and\n\n342\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.970\nreally Find out if there's any wholes or\nany gaps.\n\n343\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.610\nFill those in and\nthen we can move forward.\n\n344\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.580\n&gt;&gt; Forensics spackle.\n\n345\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, forensics spackle, I like that.\n\n346\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.340\n&gt;&gt; You can buy it at your local\nforensics hardware store.\n\n347\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.012\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go to Wikipedia and\nmake an entry for forensics spackle now.\n\n348\n00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:26.793\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's, you know what it is?\n\n349\n00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:27.380\nIt's pink slurry.\n\n350\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.480\nThat's the pink slime,\nenjoy the pink slime.\n\n351\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.570\n&gt;&gt; They use it for everything.\n\n352\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they do that, all right everyone\nthat basically completes our topic on\n\n353\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.380\nforensics in today's world.\n\n354\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.410\nWe're gonna be moving forward\nwith more on this series so\n\n355\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.790\ndefinitely come back for that.\n\n356\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.730\nAdam, we do appreciate\nyou joining us today.\n\n357\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.930\nWe appreciate your time as well, but\nit looks like it is that time for\n\n358\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.690\nus to sign off.\n\n359\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.460\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n360\n00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.460\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n361\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.290\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n362\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.228\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n363\n00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:59.225\n[MUSIC]\n\n364\n00:17:59.225 --> 00:18:01.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:11.753\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:13.714\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.860\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.170\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.974\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nit's intrigue, mystery.\n\n8\n00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:23.890\nNo, it's the CHFI version 9.\n\n9\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.226\n&gt;&gt; Cat's paws.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and cats paws.\n\n10\n00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.049\nDon't forget those.\n\n11\n00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:28.186\nAnd joining us to the studio again,\nour cat wrangler.\n\n12\n00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.474\nOur resident cat wrangler,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:32.669\nAnd this is kind of an inside joke, but.\n\n14\n00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now it's escaped, it's out\nin the wild, so now you all know about it.\n\n15\n00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:37.091\n&gt;&gt; What are they talking\nabout wrangling cats?\n\n16\n00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:37.626\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n17\n00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:38.903\nWhy are they doing that?\n\n18\n00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:41.713\nGood day where ever you are.\n\n19\n00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:43.790\nAlways glad to be spending time with you.\n\n20\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.707\nWe're going to continue our\nconversations about CHFI.\n\n21\n00:00:46.707 --> 00:00:48.635\nSpecifically, what are we\ngonna be looking at?\n\n22\n00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:49.854\nInvestigative process.\n\n23\n00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:51.577\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; What is in your mind, Daniel,\n\n24\n00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:55.210\nwhen we talk about investigative process\nor the process of investigation?\n\n25\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.520\nWhat do you think of, what comes to mind?\n\n26\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.261\n&gt;&gt; I think of looking at evidence and\ntaking notes, taking pictures,\n\n27\n00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.603\nchain of custody kind of things.\n\n28\n00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:08.389\nSo just making sure that we're\nlooking at all the angles,\n\n29\n00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:11.569\ntrying to figure out what was done and\nwho did it.\n\n30\n00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.181\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so all those things are\ndefinitely going to be part of what we've\n\n31\n00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:14.730\ntalked about.\n\n32\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.609\nWe've actually mentioned most of them\nin our first several episodes around\n\n33\n00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.456\njust this current state or\nstate of digital forensics,\n\n34\n00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.892\ncomputer forensics in\nthe modern world today.\n\n35\n00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:24.817\nEncourage you to go back,\n\n36\n00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.183\ntake a look at some of those episodes\nif you haven't seen them yet.\n\n37\n00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:30.425\nBut in addition to all that stuff, we're\ngoing to add some new things to the mix\n\n38\n00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:33.890\nthat although we've talked around,\nwe haven't really formally called out yet.\n\n39\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.478\nWe'll specify what\nthe investigative phases and\n\n40\n00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:38.330\nthe process of investigation are.\n\n41\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.729\nWe'll do that in just a moment.\n\n42\n00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.397\nWe're going to talk about risk and\nthe importance of awareness of risk\n\n43\n00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:47.498\nwith regards to how we, not only are able\nto integrate our thought process from\n\n44\n00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:50.873\nsecurity and the perspective of\nsecurity into investigation.\n\n45\n00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:53.675\nBut how we then use that\nknowledge to drive forward and\n\n46\n00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:57.921\nreally understand the things we must do\nin order to complete the investigation.\n\n47\n00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:59.662\nBut things we may want to stay away from.\n\n48\n00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:02.989\nWhat's that risk assessment matrix\nlook like, what's that methodology,\n\n49\n00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.280\nwhy is that important?\n\n50\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.670\nWe'll take a look back and review again,\n\n51\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.895\nalthough from a different perspective,\nsome additional rules of evidence,\n\n52\n00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:14.600\none specific to forensics and\nhow we deal with various aspects of that.\n\n53\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.297\nWe had a whole episode,\na whole conversation,\n\n54\n00:02:16.297 --> 00:02:17.406\non federal rules of evidence.\n\n55\n00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:19.036\nWe'll go back and\ndo a little bit more there.\n\n56\n00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:23.704\nSo we're gonna break down for you what\nthe investigative process looks like and\n\n57\n00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:24.756\nin great detail.\n\n58\n00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.533\nSome would say excruciating detail.\n\n59\n00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will go through and help you,\n\n60\n00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.293\nhopefully, to better understand the things\nthat, as a forensic investigator,\n\n61\n00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:36.280\nyou're gonna be expected to\ndo in the methodologies and\n\n62\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.393\nthe reasons why we do them the way we do.\n\n63\n00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:43.490\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be like that Spaceballs\njoke, when he's like, Rocky 5,000, right?\n\n64\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Part 5,000.\n\n65\n00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.974\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, part 5,000.\n\n66\n00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:51.410\nWe're not gonna get quite that far,\nat least not in our current conversations.\n\n67\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.553\nBut you never know,\nthere could be a CHFI part 10 or\n\n68\n00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:56.450\nversion 10 at some point in the future,\nand I'm sure there will be.\n\n69\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.629\nSo phases involved in the computer\nforensics investigative process.\n\n70\n00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.929\nThere are three distinct\nphases we call out, and\n\n71\n00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.912\nwhen you think about them logically,\nthey make a lot of sense.\n\n72\n00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:09.800\nAnd on the surface,\nthey probably sound fairly simplistic.\n\n73\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.330\nBut there's so\n\n74\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.530\nmuch detail underneath each one that we're\ngonna be spending time going through.\n\n75\n00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.960\nSo the three phases will be\nthe pre-investigation phase.\n\n76\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.640\nSo what do we do running up to\nthe investigation before we\n\n77\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280\nactually start it formally?\n\n78\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.270\nHow do we build our team so\nthat we have the experts and\n\n79\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.000\nthe tools necessary to be able to\nexecute an investigation if called on?\n\n80\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.940\nHow do we build out our lab environment\nand our analysis capabilities?\n\n81\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.320\nAll the pre-work that goes in,\nin other words, right?\n\n82\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.080\nTo prepping and getting ready so\nwe can respond.\n\n83\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.890\nWe'll be talking about in this phase.\n\n84\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.420\nHow do we then do\nthe investigation itself?\n\n85\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.720\nHow do we then go live and actually\nexecute one or more investigations?\n\n86\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.853\nFiguring out hopefully,\nalong the way, what did happen and\n\n87\n00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:51.952\ndocumenting that in a significant way.\n\n88\n00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:56.800\nAnd then post investigation,\nthe third phase, how do we wrap all\n\n89\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.670\nof that hard work up into a box or\na basket, whatever we want to do.\n\n90\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.371\nEvery time I do this with Cherokee, I'll\nsay something like a box, she's like, no,\n\n91\n00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:05.001\nno, no, baskets.\n\n92\n00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:05.838\nBaskets are my thing.\n\n93\n00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:07.136\nBaskets-\n&gt;&gt; She likes baskets.\n\n94\n00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:08.761\nSo, it's gonna be a basket-\n&gt;&gt; Sick woman.\n\n95\n00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.362\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And normally, it would be box.\n\n96\n00:04:11.362 --> 00:04:14.590\nBut for her, I always have to say baskets,\nthat's just her thing.\n\n97\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.528\nSo it would be a box or a basket\ndepending on who's standing next to her.\n\n98\n00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:22.400\nBut the post investigation phase, the idea\nwould be, how do we do our reporting,\n\n99\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.628\nour presentation of information to one or\nmore interested parties,\n\n100\n00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.860\ntalked a little bit about this\nin some of our prior episodes.\n\n101\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.400\nAudience relevancy and\n\n102\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.320\nbeing able to present information\nin an audience appropriate way.\n\n103\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.060\nHow do we potentially testify, if called\nto do so, as an expert witness or\n\n104\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.850\nas the investigator of record.\n\n105\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.468\nThese are things we would talk about\non the post investigation phase.\n\n106\n00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo we're gonna go through each of those\nphases and really use those phases as\n\n107\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.446\na road map for us, a set of guideposts\non the road that help us to understand,\n\n108\n00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:55.400\nby section along the path,\naround the investigative process.\n\n109\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.800\nWhat we're doing and\nwhat phase we're in will then tell us\n\n110\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.780\nwhat kind of activities\nwe should be engaged in.\n\n111\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.359\nBut also, the kind of things that we\nwant to make sure have been done or\n\n112\n00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.145\nthat are at our disposal, if necessary,\nin order to continue our work.\n\n113\n00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:10.180\nVery important to be thinking about that.\n\n114\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.090\nLet's start with\nthe pre-investigation phase.\n\n115\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.185\nWhen we think about pre-investigation, one\nof the things that we're talking about,\n\n116\n00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.453\nand I mentioned this just\nin the setup right now,\n\n117\n00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:20.246\nis the idea of doing all the prep work.\n\n118\n00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:24.564\nIf you do any cooking, for instance,\nright, do any baking, things like that,\n\n119\n00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:25.720\nif you build models.\n\n120\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.311\nI don't know if you're a,\nare you a model builder?\n\n121\n00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.239\n&gt;&gt; I was when I was a kid, yes.\n\n122\n00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:29.459\n&gt;&gt; I did that a lot when I was a kid too.\n\n123\n00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.283\nI did the.\n\n124\n00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:33.046\nI used to do the car,\nyou know, the car models?\n\n125\n00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:33.708\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what I did.\n\n126\n00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.239\n&gt;&gt; And the [INAUDIBLE] models,\nstuff like that, right?\n\n127\n00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:38.004\nSo you know a lot of them, if you got\nsome of those detailed model kits.\n\n128\n00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.817\nYou know there was some painting\nthat you probably had to do,\n\n129\n00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:42.880\ndepending on how serious you took it.\n\n130\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.403\nYou may have to get your little X-ACTO\nknives out and trim up the plastic, right,\n\n131\n00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:47.793\nbecause it may not fit exactly.\n\n132\n00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:49.766\nYou know, things like that, right?\n\n133\n00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.811\nAnd so you did a lot of prep work\nto make everything look good and\n\n134\n00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.166\nthis is really what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n135\n00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:59.199\nAnd so one of the most important things we\ndo in the prep phase is figure out what\n\n136\n00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.132\nall the tools are going to be,\nand all the moving parts.\n\n137\n00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.420\nThe team will talk about building a team.\n\n138\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.500\nThe operational environment,\nwe would call the computer forensic lab.\n\n139\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.800\nHow are we going to build\nall those pieces out?\n\n140\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.960\nWhat they are gonna look like?\n\n141\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.383\nAnd how do we make headway there to ensure\nthat, as we set up our work space and\n\n142\n00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:20.366\nbuild out an environment that will then\nsupport multiple investigations over time,\n\n143\n00:06:20.366 --> 00:06:23.222\nthat it's done in\na forensically sound manner.\n\n144\n00:06:23.222 --> 00:06:26.310\nFollows the rules that we have to follow.\n\n145\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.250\nMaking sure we can isolate evidence,\nstore it securely,\n\n146\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.355\nwork with it in a forensically sound way.\n\n147\n00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:37.220\nSecure the evidence so that we have chain\nof custody capability, audit capabilities.\n\n148\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.094\nThe ability to be able to validate and\n\n149\n00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:42.843\nverify through things like closed\ncircuit TV monitoring and, perhaps,\n\n150\n00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:46.902\nmultiple layers of security, physical and\nlogical, around the work spaces.\n\n151\n00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:50.408\nSo that way people can't just wander\ninto the lab and pick stuff up and\n\n152\n00:06:50.408 --> 00:06:51.743\nwalk out with it, right?\n\n153\n00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:54.115\nThese are all the things we got to plan\nfor and think about ahead of time.\n\n154\n00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:58.284\nDo we have the ability to control\nthe operational environment from\n\n155\n00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:01.120\nphysical area, physical thought process?\n\n156\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.870\nYou know, things like I just described.\n\n157\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.132\nBut what about temperature control,\nhumidity control, electrostatic control?\n\n158\n00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:10.290\nThese are things that we often\nthink about in data centers.\n\n159\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.452\nAnd we may not necessarily extend that\nthought process into a forensics work\n\n160\n00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:15.891\nspace normally, right?\n\n161\n00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:20.268\nWe obviously clearly have to, but we may\nnot be thinking about that unless somebody\n\n162\n00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:24.413\nsits us down and says hey, by the way,\nyou need four work station areas set up.\n\n163\n00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:27.216\nThey all have to be\ntemperature controlled.\n\n164\n00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:31.240\nSo we've got to have some sort of\nHVAC system that will allow us to set\n\n165\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.900\ntemperature, perhaps individually\nby work area or zone.\n\n166\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.320\nWe need to worry about dust and\nparticulate filtering, so\n\n167\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.090\nmaybe we need additional filtering.\n\n168\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.512\nWe need to worry about the ability\nto be able to provide consistent and\n\n169\n00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:47.642\nreliable power that's clean, so that\nway we're not having spikes, brownouts,\n\n170\n00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:49.716\nsurges, blackouts, things like that.\n\n171\n00:07:49.716 --> 00:07:53.788\nSo we probably need backup generators,\nUPSs, line conditioners.\n\n172\n00:07:53.788 --> 00:07:57.532\nAll this kind of stuff would be on\nthe hit list and the checklist for\n\n173\n00:07:57.532 --> 00:07:59.350\nwhat we would need.\n\n174\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.204\nAnd then the obvious things\nlike that right come up.\n\n175\n00:08:01.204 --> 00:08:03.025\nBut then the unobvious things\nthat are not so obvious.\n\n176\n00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:08.228\nSo what about power converters for\nforensic examinations of workstations and\n\n177\n00:08:08.228 --> 00:08:12.995\nportable devices that may be coming\nfrom different areas in the world.\n\n178\n00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:16.760\nThat may use different power plugs and\nsetups in order to be able to generate.\n\n179\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.860\nYou know, I've been involved with\ninvestigations and issues over the years\n\n180\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.530\nin many different countries, and I've also\nbeen involved with having to deal with\n\n181\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.540\nsomeone's laptop that may have been,\nyou know, just something simple.\n\n182\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.200\nIt got hit by malware,\nwe gotta get into it, figure it out.\n\n183\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.034\nBut if you don't have the right adapter,\nthen you may not be able to plug it in.\n\n184\n00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:38.109\nYou know, we take for granted in\nwhatever country we happen to be in,\n\n185\n00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:41.570\nthat our power system well that's just\nwhat we use everybody is used to that.\n\n186\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.140\nBut you go to somewhere else\nyou need a bunch of adapters.\n\n187\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.303\nI have two sets of travel adapters I keep\nin my go bag at all times because number\n\n188\n00:08:47.303 --> 00:08:49.021\none, I never know where I'm going to be.\n\n189\n00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:52.093\nAnd number two I never know\nif I'm going to have to work\n\n190\n00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:56.535\non someones system that may have a power\nbrick from a different nationality,\n\n191\n00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.814\ndifferent country, different area.\n\n192\n00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:02.867\nAnd as a result may have\ntwo metal prongs right?\n\n193\n00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:03.826\nThe circular prongs.\n\n194\n00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:04.472\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n195\n00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:07.877\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to let's say a traditional\nplug that we may think of here in\n\n196\n00:09:07.877 --> 00:09:11.063\nthe United States with the two\nprongs that are the rectangular.\n\n197\n00:09:11.063 --> 00:09:12.390\nYeah, rectangles, right?\n\n198\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.118\nWe're in the US right.\n\n199\n00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:14.950\n[LAUGH] Two rectangles, right?\n\n200\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.450\nAnd then the the ground for the third.\n\n201\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.700\nSo that kind of thing.\n\n202\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.290\nWhat about not only that kind of stuff,\nbut what about adapters for\n\n203\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.350\nmobile devices, right?\n\n204\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.380\nWe need different adapters to power mobile\ndevices, cell phones in particular.\n\n205\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.570\nYou may need additional batteries for\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n206\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.460\nThere's just all these things\nyou've gotta think about.\n\n207\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.370\nToday, it's fairly straightforward.\n\n208\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.423\nYet we do have the ability to go out and\nbuy the battery packs,\n\n209\n00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:43.430\nyou know the small ones for\nthe mobile devices you can buy like 5,000,\n\n210\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.394\n10,000, 20,000 milliamps.\n\n211\n00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:48.890\nAnd they'll be able to run a system for\na period of time.\n\n212\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.613\nSo you have bunch of those but you need\na lot of other stuff associated with it.\n\n213\n00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:56.250\nUSB cables of different types right\ncuz we have different standards.\n\n214\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.390\nEverything from one all\nthe way up to three now.\n\n215\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.251\nSo you've gotta have all that kinda stuff.\n\n216\n00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:03.858\nSo we need just a variety of things\nthat will be in our toolkits,\n\n217\n00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:05.706\nwe need software as well right.\n\n218\n00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.683\nWe need different kinds of software,\nwe'll talk about some tools and\n\n219\n00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:12.080\nthings of that nature but you need tools\nspecific to each operating platform.\n\n220\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.170\nSo we need tools that will run on Windows\ncertainly but we need the equivalent or\n\n221\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.600\nperhaps different ones that will run.\n\n222\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.791\nWe need different ones that will run\non Unix and Linux, on the Mac OS.\n\n223\n00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.370\nRight and things of that nature.\n\n224\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.294\nYou know a lot of times programs have been\nported to one system or another and they\n\n225\n00:10:31.294 --> 00:10:36.640\nare essentially different versions let's\nsay where you can run it by platform.\n\n226\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.745\nBut you got to have those and\n\n227\n00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:40.830\nit's not just a matter of I'll\ngo download that when I need it.\n\n228\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.590\nYou got to have a version that's tested.\n\n229\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.965\nYou got to have a version\nthat is forensically sound.\n\n230\n00:10:44.965 --> 00:10:48.360\nThat you know what will work a certain\nway, and that will be able to be\n\n231\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.730\nused without making any modifications or\nchanges to the system.\n\n232\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.450\nThat's really one of the big challenges.\n\n233\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.430\nI can go find, like you and\nI were talking before I got started.\n\n234\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.300\nI had to download a copy Adobe Acrobat\nReader, onto my Windows 10 machine here to\n\n235\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.849\nbe able to show you some PDFs that we're\ngonna take a look at in a little bit.\n\n236\n00:11:03.849 --> 00:11:07.524\nIt's because I didn't have a PDF reader\nof all things that was installed and\n\n237\n00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:11.201\navailable, so it's easy to go out and\ndownload software if you need it, but\n\n238\n00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:12.650\nthat will modify the system.\n\n239\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.520\nThat changes the system, and\n\n240\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.170\nas a result that may not be possible\nwhen we're doing investigations.\n\n241\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.340\nWe need imaging platforms because we\nneed to be able to grab images, but\n\n242\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.450\nalso create a forensically sound image for\n\n243\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.550\nour work stations with all of our software\nloaded, and our ability to control that.\n\n244\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.610\nAnd modify only under change control.\n\n245\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.700\nThese are all things that we\nsometimes we take for granted.\n\n246\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.430\nBut we got to really be thinking about and\nhaving it at the back of our minds.\n\n247\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.450\nSo when we think about what\nwe have to do to set up and\n\n248\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.050\nplan a computer forensics lab, and be able\nto certify that that lab is gonna meet\n\n249\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.160\ncertain standards, there is a whole\nthought process we go through.\n\n250\n00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.471\nRight, and we got to work on thinking\nabout planning and budgeting.\n\n251\n00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:51.868\nHow are we going to get the money for\nthis, what's it going to look like?\n\n252\n00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:56.540\nWho's going to underwrite or foot\nthe bill for this, because it can be very\n\n253\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.858\nexpensive if you've ever had to go out and\nacquire or buy equipment.\n\n254\n00:12:00.858 --> 00:12:05.718\nYou can easily spend $100,000 without\nbreaking a sweat, just by buying three or\n\n255\n00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.633\nfour high end machines and\nall the networking gear and\n\n256\n00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:11.475\nall the supporting gear\nthat goes with that.\n\n257\n00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:13.665\nThat's not to mention\nthe building itself and\n\n258\n00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:16.865\nall the other stuff that has\nto be done to set up a room.\n\n259\n00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:19.585\nI mean literally you could\njust clear a space on a desk,\n\n260\n00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:20.875\nplop yourself down and work there.\n\n261\n00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.445\nAnd that would work in a pinch, but\n\n262\n00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:26.260\nit's not going to be the same thing\nas having a certified accredited lab.\n\n263\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.600\nThat meets international standards for\nforensic investigation and\n\n264\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.260\nthere are accrediting bodies that do this\nand there are standards that we can align\n\n265\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.680\nwith and we'll talk about some\nof those in a couple of minutes.\n\n266\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.383\nSo we have to think about planning and\nbudgeting,\n\n267\n00:12:37.383 --> 00:12:39.093\nwe have to think about location and\ndesign right?\n\n268\n00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:40.165\nWhere are we gonna put this thing?\n\n269\n00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:42.785\nIs it gonna be in the existing\nbuilding that we operate in?\n\n270\n00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:45.455\nIs it gonna be out in a separate area?\n\n271\n00:12:45.455 --> 00:12:47.490\nIs there gonna be secured, if so how,\n\n272\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.003\nunder what circumstances what's\nour work area gonna look like.\n\n273\n00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:55.513\nWhat kind of licensing do we need both\nfrom the acredition stand point and for\n\n274\n00:12:55.513 --> 00:12:57.495\nas we said things like software.\n\n275\n00:12:57.495 --> 00:13:00.175\nWhat are the HR requirements for\npeople to work there,\n\n276\n00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:03.203\nhow are we gonna vet people,\nwhat are you gonna do about that,\n\n277\n00:13:03.203 --> 00:13:06.538\nhow do we manage them,\nfiscal requirements associated with that.\n\n278\n00:13:06.538 --> 00:13:09.123\nAnd then all these things\nare gonna be very important for\n\n279\n00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:10.556\nus to think about by category.\n\n280\n00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:14.810\nAnd we want to make sure that we're\nthinking about all six of these areas.\n\n281\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.010\nReally breaking them out and\nunderstanding them.\n\n282\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.530\nBecause this is the hit\nlist that we go down and\n\n283\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.990\nwork through in order to set up and\ncreate a working environment.\n\n284\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.520\nAnd again, in a pinch, in the field, you\ndo what you need to in order to figure out\n\n285\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.670\nhow to gather evidence securely and\ntransport.\n\n286\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.770\nBut you're not analyzing evidence,\ntraditionally anyway.\n\n287\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.697\nYou're not analyzing evidence in the field\nin makeshift environments except in very\n\n288\n00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:38.290\nrare and special circumstances.\n\n289\n00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.460\nTraditionally, you're just doing what we\nwould call tagging and bagging, right?\n\n290\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.221\nYou're gathering, you're putting into\napproved transport containers or\n\n291\n00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:49.159\nanti-static bags,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n292\n00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:52.918\nYou have an evidence custodian, somebody\nor a librarian or whatever you would call\n\n293\n00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:56.120\nthem who's going to be in charge\nof that process and oversee it.\n\n294\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.833\nYou're going to uniquely identify and\nstore each item.\n\n295\n00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:00.729\nYou're going to bring it back to a secure,\n\n296\n00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:04.010\nclean area where you can then operate\non it effectively and efficiently.\n\n297\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.850\nSo, we're really thinking about and\n\n298\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.329\nfocusing on the back end processes\nthat build out that environment.\n\n299\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.760\nPlanning includes a variety\nof different things right,\n\n300\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.790\ntypes of investigations you'll\nbe conducting as I suggested.\n\n301\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.587\nIf you're going to work on nothing but\nlaptop systems that are Windows based,\n\n302\n00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:22.863\nthen that's what you plan for,\nthat's the kind of lab you build and\n\n303\n00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:24.031\nthat's what you have.\n\n304\n00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:27.659\nIf you're going to be working on only\nmobile devices, you plan for that,\n\n305\n00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.296\nyou build for that, you staff for\n\n306\n00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:33.590\nthat because you need a set of skills\nassociated with that particular approach.\n\n307\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.510\nPeople that work on Windows systems\nhave a unique set of skills to Windows.\n\n308\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.410\nPeople that work in Linux and Unix,\nunique set of skills for that environment.\n\n309\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.445\nSo a lot of times, labs will work\nacross pretty much any platform and\n\n310\n00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:49.460\nalmost any device and you have people that\nare specialists in [COUGH] overarching\n\n311\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.200\ncriminalistics, overarching forensics\ninvestigation and procedures.\n\n312\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.390\nBut as we suggested in some\nof the prior episodes,\n\n313\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.810\nwe'll then bring in experts\nthat are gonna help advise or\n\n314\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:05.040\nmaybe even conduct investigations in these\nareas when we need specialists to do that.\n\n315\n00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.927\nYou need somebody who's really\ngood at getting into iPhones,\n\n316\n00:15:07.927 --> 00:15:09.951\nyou need somebody who specializes in that.\n\n317\n00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.658\nYou need a 12 year old child,\nprobably most likely, right.\n\n318\n00:15:11.658 --> 00:15:15.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so you're gonna look for that.\n\n319\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.790\nThat may not be the person\nwho is the Windows expert.\n\n320\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.010\nChances are good it may but\nchances could be it may not be.\n\n321\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.350\nAnd for instance I do a lot of\nwork in multiple platforms.\n\n322\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.170\nI don't do a lot of work on\nmobile devices like iPhones.\n\n323\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.480\nIt's not something I specialized in not\nsomething that I spend a lot of time on.\n\n324\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.730\nI can certainly gather the device,\nsecure it, and make sure,\n\n325\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.000\nforensically, it's soundly transported,\nand that there's a chain of custody\n\n326\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.860\nestablished around ownership of the device\nonce it's been gathered as evidence.\n\n327\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.120\nBut I'm, probably, not the person that\nyou want investigating that device,\n\n328\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.100\nbecause I just don't work on that\nplatform, I don't spend time on.\n\n329\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.145\nBut if it's a Blackberry.\n\n330\n00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:52.557\nI'm probably the only guy in the world.\n\n331\n00:15:52.557 --> 00:15:55.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am the guy, because that's all I do.\n\n332\n00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:58.759\nAnd that's all I've worked with for\n20, give or take about 20 years now.\n\n333\n00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.410\nIt's my device of choice.\n\n334\n00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.582\nI've used them since they\nfirst came out on the market.\n\n335\n00:16:02.582 --> 00:16:06.667\nI've used every model and\nevery version that's ever been released,\n\n336\n00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:09.920\nand I know a lot about that platform more,\nso than I do any\n\n337\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.230\nother mobile device platform, so\nas a result you look for those experts.\n\n338\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.980\nRight, those are the people you want\nprobably going to start getting a trickle,\n\n339\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.140\nlike one or two a year now.\n\n340\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.910\nLike, Blackberry.\n\n341\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.540\nWe need him, right?\n\n342\n00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.240\nThere aren't that many of us left.\n\n343\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.610\nWe're a dying breed out there, by the way,\nbut we're proud and we like our devices.\n\n344\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.610\nSo, types of investigations\nbeing conducted.\n\n345\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.720\nVery, very important.\n\n346\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.900\nReference materials.\n\n347\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.730\nYeah, what are the owner manuals, right?\n\n348\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.340\nLiterally, around these\nkinds of platforms.\n\n349\n00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.860\nDo we need documentation\non the version of Windows?\n\n350\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.960\nThe version of Apple iOS, diversion of\nthe Blackberry OS or whatever it may be.\n\n351\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.910\nAbsolutely right?\n\n352\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.830\nYou've got to have access to that.\n\n353\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.270\nToday it's a lot easier\ntoday than it ever has been.\n\n354\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.030\nYears ago you'd walk into a room and\nyou would literally have.\n\n355\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.355\nYou remember just the owner's manuals for\nWindows 95.\n\n356\n00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I mean Windows 95 came out\n\n357\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.100\nit was like 30.\n\n358\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.950\nFloppy disks to install right?\n\n359\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.800\nAnd then you would have about\na stack of books ooh yea high right?\n\n360\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.170\nKill a couple trees to put the owner\nmanual out and you put all that stuff up.\n\n361\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.540\nWe talk about resource kits I\nthink one of the last episodes.\n\n362\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.630\nAnd you're remembering that you would\ndownload those tools, but you would get\n\n363\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.260\nthat massive book that came with\nthe resource kit if you bought it right?\n\n364\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.050\nIt was like a couple thousand pages\nexplaining all the different intricacies\n\n365\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:25.320\nof how those tools work and you would\nhave you walk into that you would have\n\n366\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.500\nthat reference material printed sitting\nsomewhere where you had to go look stuff\n\n367\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.120\nup, because this was prior to the add on\nwe think of as the modern Internet and\n\n368\n00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.820\nthe modern world wide web and Google.\n\n369\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.510\nGoogle didn't exist until a certain period\nof time, as crazy as that is to say you\n\n370\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.830\nrealize that the majority of people that\nare working in our industry today, and\n\n371\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.340\nthe majority of people that probably are\ngoing to watch these kinds of episodes,\n\n372\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.160\nnot everybody, but I think the majority\nof them are probably people.\n\n373\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.220\nThat certainly are a little bit younger.\n\n374\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.730\nAnd as a result,\nmay actually not remember a time.\n\n375\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.270\n&gt;&gt; They'll never know\na day without Google?\n\n376\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.120\n&gt;&gt; Without Google.\n\n377\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.850\n&gt;&gt; That is kind of crazy to think about.\n\n378\n00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.250\n&gt;&gt; When we get to a tipping point for\n\n379\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.980\nstuff like that,\nif you think about it, right?\n\n380\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.980\nThat is kind of crazy.\n\n381\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.170\nI mean,\nI remember when soda cost a nickel.\n\n382\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.520\nYou bought it in a bottle,\nyou got it from a machine.\n\n383\n00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.860\nAnd I remember when phone\ncalls cost a nickel, too.\n\n384\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.010\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ni can't say I can go back that far.\n\n385\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.870\n&gt;&gt; I remember rotary doll phones.\n\n386\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.990\nI remember rotary doll phones.\n\n387\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.750\nI had a rotary phone.\n\n388\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.920\n&gt;&gt; You had to make a phone call.\n\n389\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very cool.\n\n390\n00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.150\n&gt;&gt; I am old.\n\n391\n00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.250\nThat's all I can say.\n\n392\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.850\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n393\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.440\nWhen I get on camera, I'm old,\nI look good on camera.\n\n394\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.120\nI don't look old, but\nit's dark enough in here.\n\n395\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.820\nYou can't really tell.\n\n396\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.338\n&gt;&gt; You can't really tell.\n\n397\n00:18:34.338 --> 00:18:38.560\n&gt;&gt; But I have alt, so anyway workstations\nas we talked about, gotta have those.\n\n398\n00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.640\nAnd this is another thing people\noften miss when we set this stuff up.\n\n399\n00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.260\nWe need the forensics workstations\nwe talked about that but\n\n400\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.080\nwhen you wanna go out and\nlook up documentation on the web to.\n\n401\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.060\nDo what we just discussed, you're not\ndoing that on a forensics work station\n\n402\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.190\nyou're doing it on a non\nforensics work station.\n\n403\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.810\nIn other words, you've got your clean\nsetup where you're forensically examining\n\n404\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.370\nstuff then you've got your I work on\nit everyday it's just my machine,\n\n405\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.520\nI do my normal stuff, check your email you\nsurf the web, right that kind of stuff.\n\n406\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.420\nSo you're gonna have both forensics and\nnon-forensics systems, and\n\n407\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.460\nthey have to be isolated from each other,\nphysically and logically.\n\n408\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.450\nVLAN, firewall, you air gapped off so\n\n409\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.920\nthat the two are not gonna potentially\nInteract with each other because you don't\n\n410\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.330\nwant something that gets into a system\nin a non-forensics part of the lab,\n\n411\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.680\nemail spreads malware,\njust does all sorts of crazy stuff, right.\n\n412\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.640\nWe don't want that, and, as a result,\n\n413\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.330\nyou've got to be very careful about that,\nso just keep that in mind, all right?\n\n414\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.140\nSo that's just the kinda\nthing we wanna think about.\n\n415\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.030\nWe need a safe locker for\nstorage gotta have a place to actually\n\n416\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.850\nlock up hard drives, computers, stuff that\ncould just grow legs and walk away right?\n\n417\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.970\nSo we wanna put that stuff in there,\n\n418\n00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.510\nusually it's some sort of\nsecured filing cabinet.\n\n419\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.960\nGot a lock on the front,\n\n420\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.840\nmaybe NRC they have biometric systems you\ncan use to secure these cabinets today,\n\n421\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.700\nthere may be a crypto lock one\nthat you punch a combo into.\n\n422\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.015\nIt's not just the old,\nyou know those crazy, they're not.\n\n423\n00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:07.505\nIt's just really they're the bad, the easy\none's to break with the lock in them.\n\n424\n00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:09.495\nYou just force them and\nbreak it's not one of those,\n\n425\n00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:11.415\nyou need something a little\nbit stronger than that.\n\n426\n00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:13.555\nA nice heavy duty lock of some kind.\n\n427\n00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:16.332\nSo we need that we'll talk about UPSs and\nthe ability to provide.\n\n428\n00:20:16.332 --> 00:20:20.932\nBackup power, preventative power that\nwill allow us to continue working so\n\n429\n00:20:20.932 --> 00:20:23.972\nwe don't lose the capability\nof working with a system.\n\n430\n00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:25.682\nNothing works,\nI'm trying to create an image right.\n\n431\n00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:28.182\nIn the middle of that you lose power,\nit just corrupts everything.\n\n432\n00:20:28.182 --> 00:20:30.046\nI mean that's obviously not good Good.\n\n433\n00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:31.356\nSo we need Internet connectivity,\n\n434\n00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:34.196\nyou need network connectivity, all\nthe standard stuff we'd be thinking about.\n\n435\n00:20:34.196 --> 00:20:35.826\nAll the software, all the hardware.\n\n436\n00:20:35.826 --> 00:20:38.736\nGotta have the capabilities\nto store information.\n\n437\n00:20:38.736 --> 00:20:40.886\nBut we want to be thinking\nabout all those things,\n\n438\n00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:42.636\nand how they are gonna be put together.\n\n439\n00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:46.840\nAnother thing we need a lot of times,\nand it's not as prevalent today.\n\n440\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.070\nBut every so often I get involved in one\nof these where we have to have worry\n\n441\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.320\nabout the fact that it's not just, hey I\nneed an adapter for an old Blackberry.\n\n442\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.810\nBut what about older systems?\n\n443\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.460\nSystems that are gonna run.\n\n444\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.180\nOn older technologies, right?\n\n445\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.310\nI mean you probably don't come across\ntoken rings very much anymore, but\n\n446\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.790\nthe reality is there are some networks out\nthere that use those kinds of standards\n\n447\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.960\nand you may need additional hardware to\nbe able to work with systems like that.\n\n448\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.930\nYou may need network adapters and,\nor connectivity, cabling,\n\n449\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:23.160\nhubs, switches, things like that\nthat may have to be specifically &gt;.\n\n450\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.100\nPut aside to be able to\nwork with this technology.\n\n451\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.470\nI had an issue a few years back\nwhere we had to go in, and\n\n452\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.800\nrecover some older servers.\n\n453\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.330\nFile servers that had been running for\nyears.\n\n454\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.470\nThat were running windows\ntwo-thousand at the time and\n\n455\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.630\nthis is an interest that hasn't\nbeen supported for quite some time.\n\n456\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.690\nAnd so we had to find and this is\nagain people don.t think about this.\n\n457\n00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.210\nWe actually,\nthis was not a forensic investigation but\n\n458\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.810\nit just goes to show you the kinda\nthing you have to worry about.\n\n459\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:55.210\nWe had to find drivers for a piece of\nhardware in that system that we needed\n\n460\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.930\nto access to restore backups in order to\nbe able to bring a system back online.\n\n461\n00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:05.630\nAnd it was a major, major mission\nto go find drivers for this old.\n\n462\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.750\nPiece of hardware that would run in that\nparticular operating system cuz you see\n\n463\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.960\nthey're not around anymore.\n\n464\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, the company may even\nbe debunked at that point.\n\n465\n00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you may not be able to go to\n\n466\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.940\ntheir website.\n\n467\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're not talking\nabout instantly like a Dell or\n\n468\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.260\na Gateway or things like that and\nso we had to get creative.\n\n469\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.400\nWe actually waited to do is using way\nback machine to go find a web archive.\n\n470\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.300\nThat actually had some links where we\ncould actually find drivers that were\n\n471\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.930\nout there and were able to get that going\nbut you have to be creative and inventive\n\n472\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.730\nwith this kind of stuff, really think\nthrough the logic of some of those things.\n\n473\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.520\nI mentioned licensing and the fact that\nwe often or not often, we should and\n\n474\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.890\nwe often do but not always,\nwe can license, and get certified.\n\n475\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.730\nOur forensic lab, and\nthere are bodies that do this.\n\n476\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.960\nThe American society of crime laboratory\ndirectors, what's called the ASCLD\n\n477\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.140\nis an international body,\neven though it says the American Society.\n\n478\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.590\nIt's an international body.\n\n479\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.420\nIt's used by law enforcement agencies and\ncertifies labs all over the world.\n\n480\n00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.250\nSo it certifies for instance labs,\nforensics labs, that investigate and\n\n481\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.030\ndo forensics work worldwide.\n\n482\n00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.220\nSo ASCLD would be one of\nthose bodies you would go to.\n\n483\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.520\nThey have a standards-based\napproach much like\n\n484\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.840\nan ISO-based format where you would\ncertify under those guidelines and\n\n485\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.910\nthen you pay a certain amount of money,\nyou keep your certification current,\n\n486\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.890\nthere's recertification every so\nmany years that kind of thing.\n\n487\n00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:37.510\nForensics labs around the globe\nwill seek ASCLD lab certification,\n\n488\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.480\nbut if they do that they have to adhere\nto a very specific ISO standard.\n\n489\n00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.066\nISO 17025.\n\n490\n00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:47.786\nSo ISO 17025 are the general requirements\nfor the competence of testing and\n\n491\n00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:51.657\ncalibration laboratories,\nmeaning in other words,\n\n492\n00:23:51.657 --> 00:23:55.710\nthis was written in 1999,\nthe original standards.\n\n493\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.980\nSo it's about 18 give or\ntake years old now.\n\n494\n00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.150\nAnd this set of standards is\ngonna be the international body.\n\n495\n00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.770\nAnd the set of standards that are set\nup by it, that allow us to be able to\n\n496\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:13.040\nbaseline a forensics investigatory lab or\na process associated with certifying them.\n\n497\n00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.740\nAnd then as a result, ASCLD has\nsupplemental stuff they lay on top.\n\n498\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.310\nTheir supplemental requirements for\n\n499\n00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.560\naccreditation, that they lay\non top of the ISO standard.\n\n500\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.330\nBut between the two,\nthey cover all the bases and\n\n501\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.690\nlabs that operate at this level will\nbe ASCLD certified and ISO aligned.\n\n502\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.950\nSo, you just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that and\n\n503\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.765\nthat you're thinking about those cuz, that\nstandard, the ISO standard, the number and\n\n504\n00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:39.025\nthe ASCLD information.\n\n505\n00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:40.275\nYou never know when that may come up.\n\n506\n00:24:40.275 --> 00:24:42.185\nYou never know,\ncertainly in the real world, first of all.\n\n507\n00:24:42.185 --> 00:24:44.995\nWhether if you're gonna be in a lab, and\nyou do have to get certified if you're\n\n508\n00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:46.732\nstarting one up,\nyou have to be aware of that.\n\n509\n00:24:46.732 --> 00:24:49.752\nBut also if you ever gonna be\nasked questions about something.\n\n510\n00:24:49.752 --> 00:24:53.032\nYou may wanna know that there's\nan ISO standard out there.\n\n511\n00:24:53.032 --> 00:24:56.962\nThey wanna know that there's an\ninternational certifying body out there.\n\n512\n00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:59.112\nAnd how those two things interact and\nwork together.\n\n513\n00:24:59.112 --> 00:25:01.998\nCould be useful information for you,\nso it may just be something for\n\n514\n00:25:01.998 --> 00:25:02.866\nyou to think about.\n\n515\n00:25:02.866 --> 00:25:05.457\n&gt;&gt; Probably keep you away from those\nBilly's Computer Forensics and\n\n516\n00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:06.321\nTaco Truck, right?\n\n517\n00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:08.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, Forensics Lab and Box, right?\n\n518\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, Mobile Forensics Lab and\nBurgers, yeah.\n\n519\n00:25:10.662 --> 00:25:12.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can buy it at Amazon.\n\n520\n00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:16.429\nAmazon sells it, 19.95 and free shipping\nif you're a Prime member, right, so Today.\n\n521\n00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:20.790\n&gt;&gt; Today,\nanywhere in the world [INAUDIBLE].\n\n522\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Well Adam I know we've got a lot\nmore on this conversation to cover.\n\n523\n00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.400\nWe just really scratched\nthe surface on this but our\n\n524\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.460\nclock is ticking down very very quickly\nwith little time left to go, so it looks\n\n525\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.510\nlike we're gonna have to roll into a part\ntwo on this, but we kind of figured that.\n\n526\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.880\nThe outset of this here little program,\n\n527\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.600\nhopefully you guys have enjoyed it this\nfar and we'll continue on with this.\n\n528\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.910\nAs for this episode, then we are going to\ngo ahead and call it a day for ITProTV.\n\n529\n00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.200\nI am your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n530\n00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.250\n&gt;&gt; That would be me.\n\n531\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.447\nI am not Daniel Lowry,\nI am somebody else, I am Adam Gordon.\n\n532\n00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:50.062\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n533\n00:25:50.062 --> 00:25:50.646\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n534\n00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:57.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n535\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.326\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:07.828\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:10.482\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:16.740\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.880\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie with more on\nour CHI9 version and of course joining\n\n7\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.960\nus in the studio again Continuing our\nconversation on the investigator process.\n\n8\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.152\nThe disembodied hand himself Mr.\nThing from the Adam's family.\n\n9\n00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:31.936\nNo, it's Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:34.330\n[LAUGH] Adam welcome\nback man how is it going?\n\n11\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.853\n&gt;&gt; Good, good,\nI don't know where that hand came from.\n\n12\n00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:37.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just standing here minding my\n\n13\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510\nown business and you've said\na floating hand out of nowhere.\n\n14\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.566\nIt looks suspiciously like this one but\nI don't know where it came from.\n\n15\n00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:48.018\n&gt;&gt; An investigator might say I discovered\nsome very much similarities between that\n\n16\n00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:48.940\nhand and yours.\n\n17\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.244\n&gt;&gt; They would do an analysis and\nfind that it looks suspiciously identical.\n\n18\n00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:55.180\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; It would almost be the same.\n\n19\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.890\n&gt;&gt; One could say.\n\n20\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.992\n&gt;&gt; You could say that, you would.\n\n21\n00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.448\nA practical application of\nthe investigative process right as we\n\n22\n00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:01.015\nget started.\n\n23\n00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:01.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n24\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.570\nwe're gonna continue our conversations\naround what the investigative\n\n25\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.800\nprocess looks like.\n\n26\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.847\nWe started over a broad level talking\nabout the ideas about the ideas behind\n\n27\n00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:12.931\nthe three phases that we engage in,\npreinvestigative,\n\n28\n00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.134\ninvestigative, post investigation.\n\n29\n00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:18.689\nStarted to dive into\nthe preinvestigative phase a little bit,\n\n30\n00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.372\nhow we build out our\ncomputer forensic's lab,\n\n31\n00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:25.010\npotentially how we make it certified and\naccredited globally.\n\n32\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.340\nWhat are some of the thought\nprocesses around planning?\n\n33\n00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.844\nThings that we have to take into account,\nand things that we may or may not see.\n\n34\n00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:33.950\nAs being obvious we've discussed\nthose in our prior conversation.\n\n35\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.520\nIf you haven't seen that probably a good\nplace for you to go back, take a look and\n\n36\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.100\nbegin the journey us there.\n\n37\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.780\nSo that as we continue these\nconversations on this theme you're\n\n38\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.567\ngonna have a better sense how we build\nthat knowledge and put it together.\n\n39\n00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:45.728\nWe wanna jump back and\n\n40\n00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:49.287\ntalk a bit about another phase of\nthe pre investigative process.\n\n41\n00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:50.635\nHow are we gonna deal with imaging?\n\n42\n00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:54.075\nWe're talking about imaging\nin some prior episodes, and\n\n43\n00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:59.557\nthe idea behind what the imaging process\nwould be is fairly straight forward right.\n\n44\n00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:02.125\nWe're gonna be able to\ncapture in some way,\n\n45\n00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:06.640\nforensically sound of course in some\nway using a certain set of tools.\n\n46\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.140\nA bit stream copy,\na representation identical to the source\n\n47\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.150\nof the information on the targets\nare on the other source computer.\n\n48\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.110\nAnd then put it somewhere,\ncertify it forensically.\n\n49\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.927\nHashing will help us to do that and\nallow us to then work on the copy or\n\n50\n00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:25.694\ncopies, usually have more than one.\n\n51\n00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:28.594\nCuz we may wanna involve\nourselves with different\n\n52\n00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:31.020\nkinds of investigative processes.\n\n53\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.500\nWe may wanna look at the data\nfrom different perspectives.\n\n54\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.510\nAnd so we may wanna be able to do\nthat with more than one copy so\n\n55\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.680\nwe can run multiple tests simultaneously\nand be able to do things and\n\n56\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.590\nobviously scale up when we have\na large amount of data to go through.\n\n57\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.440\nSo your imaging system and how you plan\nfor that is gonna be very important.\n\n58\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.170\nIt's gotta have automatic\nright protection built in.\n\n59\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.994\nWe talked about right blocking in a couple\nof different episodes prior to this,\n\n60\n00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:56.522\nthe idea behind using some sort\nof device that will prevent\n\n61\n00:02:56.522 --> 00:03:00.560\ndata flowing back into the source\nsystem as we're exfiltrating.\n\n62\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.350\nWe're moving data out so that we don't\nmodify metadata, don't modify file access,\n\n63\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.790\nor time stamps, and logs, and\nthings of that nature, very important for\n\n64\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.060\nus to be aware of all that, right?\n\n65\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n66\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.002\nWe wanna have preview capability.\n\n67\n00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:18.933\nThe ability to be able to see and preview\nthe data that we're imaging to ensure we\n\n68\n00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:21.530\nunderstand what it's gonna\nultimately look like.\n\n69\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.500\nIs it gonna be a proper copy,\nare we gonna get the data that we want?\n\n70\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.150\nAre we gonna see hidden data,\ndata that may or\n\n71\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.630\nmay not be available to us and\nobvious as we take a look.\n\n72\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.660\nAnd if you wanna join me here,\njust one sec and\n\n73\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.914\nlet me just bring up\nthe machine before we do that.\n\n74\n00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:39.190\nOr we could do that while I'm bringing\nup the machine, that would work as well.\n\n75\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.620\nSo if you wanna take a look here,\nfor instance, I have, and\n\n76\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.020\nwe're gonna get into\nthis a little bit later.\n\n77\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.305\nI'm gonna do a kind of a walk through\non how we use a tool like this but\n\n78\n00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:50.960\none of the things that I've\ndone here with this tool.\n\n79\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.069\nI've gone in and\nI've opened up a case file and\n\n80\n00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.950\ntaken an image of a hard drive and\nused a tool called DD to create an image.\n\n81\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.940\nSo a Linux Unix based tool\nto create a drive image.\n\n82\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.344\nAnd then I've loaded that drive image and\nI've been able to go in and\n\n83\n00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:08.451\nI've been able to examine that\ndrive image using this tool and\n\n84\n00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:11.330\nadd it to the case file and\nsee all the data that's there.\n\n85\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.898\nAnd I'm looking at just\na bunch of different icons and\n\n86\n00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:19.510\nthings like that that you can see here,\nright that are available.\n\n87\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.420\nThese are image files\nthat are sitting there.\n\n88\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.928\nI've got a bunch of other information\nthat I might add in right?\n\n89\n00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:27.570\nSo I've got a bunch of different\nstuff that I can find.\n\n90\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.898\nAnd the imaging software is gonna\nallow me to be able to grab this\n\n91\n00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.930\nforensically sound copy of the hard drive.\n\n92\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.549\nAnd then be able to allow us to use that.\n\n93\n00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:40.190\nAnd so we wanna make sure we\nhave those capabilities, and\n\n94\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.710\ncan produce that kinda stuff, and\nlook at that data, whether it's there,\n\n95\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.010\nwhether it's been quote-un-quote deleted.\n\n96\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.425\nCuz we really can't ever get rid of data,\nwe just simply make it unobvious for\n\n97\n00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:49.955\nyou to see it.\n\n98\n00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.946\nBut we can recover that data, and I'll\nshow you in some walk throughs how we use\n\n99\n00:04:53.946 --> 00:04:57.153\ntools to be able to recover data\nthat may have disappeared, but\n\n100\n00:04:57.153 --> 00:05:00.380\nis actually not gone forever,\njust simply removed from view.\n\n101\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.074\nYou want mapping data from\nthe file allocation table and\n\n102\n00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.479\nhiding it from the GUI is\na wonderful concept, but\n\n103\n00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.500\nwe know how to get around that when\nwe're trained as forensic investigators.\n\n104\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.596\nAlso, it's hackers, by the way.\n\n105\n00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:12.024\nProbably one of the best\nthings you can do, and\n\n106\n00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:13.350\nwe haven't really made this connection.\n\n107\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.290\nI know I made it in prior versions,\nwhen we did CHFI and version 8, and\n\n108\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.575\nwe talked about this was CEH out there\nas well, when we did those shows.\n\n109\n00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:26.030\nAnd I'll make the connection for\nyou here, as we're getting into this now.\n\n110\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.747\nBut probably some of the best\ntraining you can get for\n\n111\n00:05:28.747 --> 00:05:31.960\nyourself with regards to\nunderstanding how to be a really good\n\n112\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.700\nforensic investigator is to understand\nhow to be a really good hacker.\n\n113\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.770\nAnd we make this connection quite often\nwhen we talk about security in general.\n\n114\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.150\nYou hear me refer to this a lot in some\nof the other security shows we've done.\n\n115\n00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.820\nWhere we've talked about the skills\nthat hackers bring to the table.\n\n116\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.626\nAnd how to be a good defensive\nsecurity professional,\n\n117\n00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:52.770\nyou have to understand how to be a good\noffensive security professional.\n\n118\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.290\nAnd those skills,\nwhen applied in the right way for\n\n119\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.830\nthe right reasons with the right overlay,\nthe code of ethics, and all the things we\n\n120\n00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.650\ntalk about, allow you to understand how\nto operate and have the mindset of people\n\n121\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.720\nthat are looking to attack you in the\ndefensive way to be better at your job.\n\n122\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.270\nAnd it's the same idea here, right?\n\n123\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.540\nThis idea of being able to understand\nthe anti-forensics thought process.\n\n124\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.578\nI mentioned this in one\nof our earlier shows.\n\n125\n00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:18.042\nAnd this idea being\nanti-forensics mindset.\n\n126\n00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:21.050\nWe'll come back to this, and talk more\nabout this in upcoming shows later.\n\n127\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.948\nHow do we defeat anti-forensics?\n\n128\n00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:24.360\nWhat are we doing there?\n\n129\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.560\nHow do we operate with the mindset of\na hacker to be able to understand how to\n\n130\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.570\nthen See what the hacker\ndoesn't want us to see.\n\n131\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.590\nHow do we find them out\nwhat they instruct us.\n\n132\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.470\nHow do we see that they've\nmodified system files?\n\n133\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.346\nHow do we understand that that log may not\nbe accurate because either there is a gap\n\n134\n00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:41.937\nor they've edited those files or\nthey are hiding behind the smoke screen or\n\n135\n00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:43.358\nwhatever that case maybe.\n\n136\n00:06:43.358 --> 00:06:45.388\nThe forensic investigator has\nto be able to do these things.\n\n137\n00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:48.210\nAnd this doesn't just happen, right?\n\n138\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.673\nYou don't just sit up at night and\n\n139\n00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:52.240\nall of a sudden boof all that\nknowledge comes in your head.\n\n140\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.537\nRemember the, you have seen it,\n\n141\n00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:56.280\nI keep asking you about the Dr Strange\nhave you seen the movie, right?\n\n142\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.310\n&gt;&gt; I did see actually.\n\n143\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.374\nI have finally seen it.\n\n144\n00:06:58.374 --> 00:06:59.798\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nif you remember the movie, right?\n\n145\n00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:00.422\nA great movie.\n\n146\n00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:01.500\n&gt;&gt; I did, it was very entertaining.\n\n147\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.245\n&gt;&gt; So, if you remember the movie,\nyou remember that the,\n\n148\n00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:10.184\n[COUGH] As Dr Strange,\nthe character is Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\n149\n00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:12.934\nSo when he finally kinda\nmoves into this role and\n\n150\n00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:17.335\ntakes on this persona Member as he's\ngathering knowledge in the library and\n\n151\n00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:20.860\nhe's got his astral projection reading,\nhe's sleeping.\n\n152\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.815\nYou see him at the foot of the bed\nhe's kinda reading all the books and\n\n153\n00:07:24.815 --> 00:07:28.304\nI love when he pops out of the theater and\nhe grabs the books.\n\n154\n00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:29.780\nWell, on top of the librarian.\n\n155\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.988\nNot giving anything away, right?\n\n156\n00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:32.520\nBut, he grabs all the books, right?\n\n157\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.090\nHe's like poking around,\nand takes the apple.\n\n158\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.502\nThat's kinda cool stuff, right.\n\n159\n00:07:36.502 --> 00:07:38.777\nSo, we're not talking about that,\nyou're not gonna ask for\n\n160\n00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:39.562\na projection yourself-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:41.344\n&gt;&gt; And try to figure out how to become\n\n162\n00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:43.699\nbetter but\nwe are talking about studying and\n\n163\n00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.216\nreally getting into the mindset of what an\nethical hacker would be, is gonna give you\n\n164\n00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:52.244\ntremendous value in terms of how to\nbe better at forensic investigations.\n\n165\n00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:55.887\nI'm not suggesting you have to go out and\nget certified As an ethical hacker,\n\n166\n00:07:55.887 --> 00:07:59.642\nthat's not a bad idea and it wouldn't\nhurt you, but I'm just pointing out that\n\n167\n00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:03.679\nwhether you do that or not, understanding\nthat knowledge base and leveraging some of\n\n168\n00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:07.470\nthose skills is gonna make you better at\neverything you do on the security side.\n\n169\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.215\nWhether it's forensic investigation,\nwhether it's just\n\n170\n00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:14.245\naverage everyday blocking and\ntackling, security 101 administration.\n\n171\n00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.975\nAll those things, it's gonna make you\nbetter regardless of what you do, so\n\n172\n00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:17.617\nkeep that in mind.\n\n173\n00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:21.185\nWe wanna probably have passedword cracking\ncapabilities built into our imaging\n\n174\n00:08:21.185 --> 00:08:21.729\nplatform.\n\n175\n00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:24.298\nMay be important for\nus to be able to un-encrypt and\n\n176\n00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:28.067\ntherefore access data that's been\nencrypted, so we need un-encryption\n\n177\n00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:31.865\ncapabilities decryption would be\nsomething else to consider there.\n\n178\n00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:34.918\nBut also password protection for\nfiles that have been locked and\n\n179\n00:08:34.918 --> 00:08:36.588\nwe wanna be able to unlock them.\n\n180\n00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:39.138\nSo, whatever kind of password\ncracking tools you use,\n\n181\n00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:43.918\na lot of times these imaging platforms and\nthese case file management systems,\n\n182\n00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:47.438\nlike I was just showing you,\nare gonna have these add-ons,\n\n183\n00:08:47.438 --> 00:08:49.770\nthese modules, that will give\nyou additional capabilities.\n\n184\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.990\nYou wanna be aware of those,\nobviously leverage those if appropriate.\n\n185\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.263\nUnlimited capacity, or\ntheoretically anyway,\n\n186\n00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:58.040\nunlimited capacity to add\ninformation in storage.\n\n187\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.560\nJust based on mounting it on\nthe back end and working with it,\n\n188\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.225\nso it's gotta scale up to\nlarge partitions today.\n\n189\n00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:07.303\nIn cloud environments today,\nin virtualized environments today,\n\n190\n00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:10.900\ndata store partitions could be\nup to 64 terabytes in size.\n\n191\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.682\nWe have to understand that we\nmay have to interrogate and\n\n192\n00:09:13.682 --> 00:09:16.524\nwork with data sets that\nare incredibly large today, and\n\n193\n00:09:16.524 --> 00:09:20.095\n64 terabytes is a lot of information\nno matter how you cut it, right.\n\n194\n00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:22.072\nAnd that's a lot of stuff, so\n\n195\n00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:26.070\nyou gotta have software that\nwill scale to that level.\n\n196\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.167\nPrograms that are 5,\n\n197\n00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.860\n6, 7 years old are not gonna\nrecognize 64 terabyte partitions.\n\n198\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.760\nThey're just not gonna be able to\nunderstand them, so keep that in mind.\n\n199\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.650\nWanna make sure we have the ability to\nchoose a variety of different source\n\n200\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.560\ndrives and technologies.\n\n201\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.450\nTape, and hard drives, and SSD drives, and\n\n202\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.400\nSATA, and PATA, and\nall those kind of standards.\n\n203\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.612\nThe imaging platforms have to\nbe able to work with those so\n\n204\n00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:51.494\nthat we can draw data from\na variety of sources.\n\n205\n00:09:51.494 --> 00:09:55.230\nGotta think about that, USB, we talked\nabout that, different versions of USB\n\n206\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.080\nsupport, we have to be able to use and\ninteract with all that.\n\n207\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.510\nWe may wanna have the ability to be\nable to access other media types,\n\n208\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.350\nas I talked about, so\nSD cards for instance, right.\n\n209\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.530\nPeople often over look this,\ndon't think about this, but\n\n210\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.710\nthere's a lot in the mobile platforms,\na lot of external storage that's\n\n211\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.370\nadded to these devices, or internal on\nboard storage that we have to access.\n\n212\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.470\nAn Apple device is gonna only have\ninternal storage, you can't add,\n\n213\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.940\nin other words,\nan SD card to augment the storage.\n\n214\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.970\nIt's whatever you buy it with, 128 gigs,\nright or whatever it comes with.\n\n215\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.670\nBut, on the Blackberry,\non many Android devices, you add or\n\n216\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.930\ncan add additional SD cards, so you can\nactually have secondary storage systems.\n\n217\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.140\nAnd you're gonna have to use those, and\ninteract with those, and image those, and\n\n218\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.136\ngrab forensically sound copies of them.\n\n219\n00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:44.830\nSo, we gotta be thinking about that, and\nunderstand the fact that there may be\n\n220\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.320\na lot of times where we're gonna\nbe using alternate media sources.\n\n221\n00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.421\nAnd we over look it, and we just don't\nthink about it until it happens,\n\n222\n00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:54.903\nthen you're scrambling around for\nthe SD card adapter,\n\n223\n00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:57.280\ntrying to figure out how to\nget that thing in there, and\n\n224\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.200\ninteract with it, and\nit's not obvious how to do that sometimes.\n\n225\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.903\nAnd to do it is one thing, but to do it in\na forensically sound way is quite another,\n\n226\n00:11:03.903 --> 00:11:05.530\nso we gotta be thinking about that.\n\n227\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.640\nWhich brings up an interesting point,\nright, so forensically sound,\n\n228\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.500\nI keep coming back to this.\n\n229\n00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.947\nWe talked about ISO standard,\nan system that's available for\n\n230\n00:11:12.947 --> 00:11:14.380\ncertification of labs.\n\n231\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.850\nThere are other standards that\nwe may adhere to as well.\n\n232\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.940\nSo how do we know that we're doing\nthings in a forensically sound way?\n\n233\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.810\nDo we just say the magic words right, so\nlike Beetlejuice's name just say it three\n\n234\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.490\ntimes and he appears, or Voldemort,\nnever mention his name right?\n\n235\n00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.135\n&gt;&gt; Never underestimate\nthe power of guessing.\n\n236\n00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:30.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you know you could do\n\n237\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.820\nthat as well, but you know the idea that\nwe would think about or that we would\n\n238\n00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.860\noften talk about, you've heard me say this\nbefore is that we trust but verify, right?\n\n239\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.987\nSo, the value of auditing is what\nwe're trying to get at here.\n\n240\n00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:41.780\nWhy do we audit?\n\n241\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.810\nWe audit to certify and validate that our\nassumptions, or guesses, our assumptions,\n\n242\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.830\nI prefer assumptions personally.\n\n243\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.670\nBut assumptions or guesses are indeed\ncorrect and if they are not, we want to\n\n244\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.890\nbring that to light and show that,\nright, shine light on that to validate\n\n245\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.150\nthat there is something else going on,\nand that we have to act accordingly.\n\n246\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.980\nSo, we have to examine and really\nunderstand the environment and audit and\n\n247\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.010\nvalidate that it's happening.\n\n248\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:08.240\nIf we say that the system that we're using\nis forensically sound and meets these\n\n249\n00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.320\nstandards and is certified, well, we gotta\ngo through the checklists and ensure that.\n\n250\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.980\nIf we have a clean room,\nwhere we're gonna do forensic analysis,\n\n251\n00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.020\nwe have to make sure that the room is\nindeed gonna meet those standards.\n\n252\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.200\nIt has positive airflow, right?\n\n253\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.650\nOverflow is what we call it.\n\n254\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.940\nSo you've got more air pressure in\nthe room than you do outside, and\n\n255\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.130\nair flows out instead of flowing\nin when you open the door.\n\n256\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.403\nAnd as a result, you don't suck dirt and\ndebris in from the outside, but\n\n257\n00:12:30.403 --> 00:12:32.280\nyou push air out that keeps it out.\n\n258\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.220\nYou may have blowers over the door, right,\n\n259\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.760\nthat will blow debris off\nyou as you walk through.\n\n260\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.720\nAlways messes up my hair when I do that, I\njusth hate going into those places, right?\n\n261\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.860\nI have a bad hair day after that,\nit's hard to work.\n\n262\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.910\n&gt;&gt; It's not coif-friendly.\n\n263\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm all put off after that.\n\n264\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.390\nI can never focus.\n\n265\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.550\nIt's just really hard for\nme to do my work that day.\n\n266\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.390\nSo we have all that.\n\n267\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.250\nSo you have to wear hair nets.\n\n268\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n269\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.460\nSo it's a big deal.\n\n270\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.040\nBut you may have seen these systems or\nbeen involved with them.\n\n271\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.320\nCertain data centers will\nhave these capabilities.\n\n272\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.620\nAreas that are secured for\na variety of reasons will have them.\n\n273\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.630\nSo that kind of thing.\n\n274\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.375\nDo we have the proper doors and locks?\n\n275\n00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:07.520\nDo we have, like I was saying in\nthe prior episode, a file cabinet.\n\n276\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.360\nIt's kind of just this very, very flimsy\ndoor and lock that we could break\n\n277\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.800\njust by putting a little pressure on it or\ndo we have a really heavy duty secure door\n\n278\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.080\nthat we can use and as a result a locking\nmechanism that will be there as well.\n\n279\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.310\nAre the locks working property?\n\n280\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.890\nIt's one thing to have an imposing looking\nsecurity perimeter, it's another to push\n\n281\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.590\non it and find out it falls right over cuz\nnobody's bothered to service the thing.\n\n282\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.540\nI've been in areas where we've got highly\nsecure environments with card scans and\n\n283\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.320\nbiometric systems, but the door's propped\nopen because the system isn't working.\n\n284\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.390\nSo there's no security\ninvolved with that right.\n\n285\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.450\nSo these are the kind of\nthings we gotta think about.\n\n286\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.370\nMaking sure that we can look\nat the evidence logs on demand\n\n287\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.090\nto see who's been accessing evidence.\n\n288\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.250\nAre they electronic?\n\n289\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.390\nAre they physical?\n\n290\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.450\nAre they physical but with an electronic\noverlay or vice versa for backups?\n\n291\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.150\nI talked about this in other episodes in\nother shows unrelated to this topic but\n\n292\n00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.710\nI'll bring it up here again.\n\n293\n00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:03.120\nA lot of my customers in many,\nmay segments, many verticals of industry\n\n294\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.920\ntoday, the medical field in particular, in\nthe banking and financial services fields.\n\n295\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.810\nAgain, in particular are reverting back\nto old school methodologies for BCDR,\n\n296\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.060\nbusiness conservation and disaster\nrecovery, in particularly in this area.\n\n297\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.260\nThey are going back to having\nsecondary analog copies of records.\n\n298\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.910\nin English, just in general speak, they're\ncreating paper copies of stuff that is\n\n299\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.520\nelectronic and storing that and\nvaulting it somewhere off-site, so\n\n300\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.090\nthat if there is an issue, a catastrophic\nsystem failure, whatever the case may be.\n\n301\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.370\nThat they actually can go back and\nrefer to that data if they have to either\n\n302\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.500\nrestore and or recover capabilities\nduring a window period of time,\n\n303\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.840\nor even ongoing for a certain\nperiod of time to run operations.\n\n304\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.800\nAnd this sounds crazy and\nwacky in today's world, right?\n\n305\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.550\nI mean, who goes and keeps records\non paper with pencil anymore?\n\n306\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.350\nBut that's the exact\nreason why it makes so\n\n307\n00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.960\nmuch sense, because you can't\ninfect paper records with malware.\n\n308\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.655\nIf you think about thee logic of it,\nyou can't.\n\n309\n00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:02.450\nYou got to worry about fire,\nyou got to worry about water,\n\n310\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.930\nyou gotta worry about humidity,\nyou gotta worry about standard stuff.\n\n311\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.160\nBut you've got to worry about\nall that with electronics,\n\n312\n00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.470\nI mean that stuff's\nalready been done anyway.\n\n313\n00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.380\nYou've got secure storage,\nyou've got data centers that have\n\n314\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.700\nfire suppression systems that\nare electronic friendly,\n\n315\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.440\nso they are probably not shooting water,\nthey would be shooting chemicals, right?\n\n316\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.530\nOr some sort of gas to put out a fire.\n\n317\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.730\nThose kind of things\nare probably in place.\n\n318\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:30.410\nYou can get secure storage for analog or\nhard records in climate-controlled,\n\n319\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.450\ntemperature-monitored environments, and\nyou can deal with all those things.\n\n320\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.978\nBut they're archiving these\nrecords because if have somebody\n\n321\n00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:42.568\ntakes the next step in a cyber conflict\nand nukes the power grid, which let's hope\n\n322\n00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:46.648\nnever happens but it's not unrealistic\nin today's world by any means.\n\n323\n00:15:46.648 --> 00:15:51.167\nAnd if that was to happen, or somebody\nlaunched malware that targeted certain\n\n324\n00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:55.827\nkinds of things, specifically designed\nto take out elements of the power grid.\n\n325\n00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:57.495\nMaybe not the whole grid, but\n\n326\n00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:02.031\nmaybe You'll power in certain areas in key\ncities in key sectors of the economy or\n\n327\n00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:06.303\ntook out the financial services\ncapabilities of banks and trading stocks,\n\n328\n00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:10.500\nthings like that, and just took\nout electronic commerce gateways.\n\n329\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.510\nImagine the chaos that ensues, right?\n\n330\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.390\nIt's great to have the capability to\naccess stuff electronically as long as you\n\n331\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.130\nhave power, but when power goes away and\n\n332\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.845\nthe internet goes away, electronics\nare not the best thing to have, right?\n\n333\n00:16:21.845 --> 00:16:24.735\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You wanna have hardcoded systems.\n\n334\n00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:27.285\nThat's really where that\nthing is gonna be important.\n\n335\n00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:28.740\nSo we gotta think about these things.\n\n336\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.145\nBecause we may need those\ncapabilities at some point,\n\n337\n00:16:31.145 --> 00:16:33.225\nand falling back on them is important.\n\n338\n00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:36.872\nSo we've got data all over the place,\nbut how do we actually deal\n\n339\n00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:40.422\nwith this data will be a thing to consider\nand a question to be concerned with.\n\n340\n00:16:40.422 --> 00:16:43.242\nSo we audit because we trust but\nverify, right?\n\n341\n00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:45.132\nThat's very important\nas a thought process.\n\n342\n00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:47.612\nSpeaking of data, we've talked\nabout different kinds of data.\n\n343\n00:16:47.612 --> 00:16:50.310\nStatic or non-volatile data.\n\n344\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.380\nVolatile or dynamic data and remnant data.\n\n345\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.480\nWe mentioned these in\nprior pursuit as well.\n\n346\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.310\nThere is data everywhere but how do\nwe deal with the management of data.\n\n347\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.780\nWell we've got conversations\ncoming up about that.\n\n348\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.460\nHow do we find data that's left behind?\n\n349\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.350\nWe've got a conversation\nis coming up about that.\n\n350\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.780\nHow do we destroy data so\nthat we can forensically\n\n351\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.990\nmake sure that the data has been removed\nproperly from a system if necessary?\n\n352\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.976\nHow do we recover it if necessary?\n\n353\n00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:18.180\nThese are questions that we\nneed to wrestle with, and\n\n354\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.250\nsecurity professionals,\nwe may have legitimate compelling reasons.\n\n355\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.010\nStandards based,\nregulatory compliance based,\n\n356\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.680\npolicy based to remove data at a certain\npoint in time based on a retention policy.\n\n357\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.260\nAnd we have to probably follow up and\nensure that that's being done.\n\n358\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.630\nAs an investigator, we have a compelling\nreason to go in and find data,\n\n359\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.760\nthat's been removed without the proper\npermission without the proper reason.\n\n360\n00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.280\nSo we have to recover that data.\n\n361\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.206\nBut there are compelling reasons to\nlegitimately soundly remove data from\n\n362\n00:17:46.206 --> 00:17:48.690\na system and ensure its destruction.\n\n363\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.430\nWhat are the standards\nassociated with doing that?\n\n364\n00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.730\nThere are international standards for\nthis.\n\n365\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.410\nThe US Department of Defense has\nstandards, the DoD standard 5220.\n\n366\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:03.520\n5220, so 5220.22m is the DoD, or\none of the DoD standards for this.\n\n367\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.390\nThere are others.\n\n368\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.310\nThere is a Russian standard called ghost,\nor\n\n369\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.410\ngost as you would properly pronounce it.\n\n370\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.220\nSo there's a gost standard, there is\nthe Navso standard, the VSITR standards.\n\n371\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.600\nThere's a bunch of different\nstandards out there.\n\n372\n00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.720\nAnd you can reference them, look them up,\nGoogle for them, you can read up on them.\n\n373\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.800\nI'm not suggesting one is\nbetter than the other.\n\n374\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.700\nI'm not suggesting that\nyou only follow one.\n\n375\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.640\nYou obviously follow\nthe standards organizationally.\n\n376\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.505\nAnd from a regulatory and a compliance\nperspective that your thought process in\n\n377\n00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:34.166\nyour origination has specified or\nimportant for you.\n\n378\n00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.887\nAnd if you're fishing around looking for\none, then you go out and\n\n379\n00:18:36.887 --> 00:18:39.720\nyou find the standards that\nseem to make the most sense.\n\n380\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.370\nIn the US certainly in the government and\n\n381\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.500\nmilitary, DOD standards are typically\nfollowed for things like that.\n\n382\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.600\nFifth standards on the government side,\nDOD standards on the military side\n\n383\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.120\nfederal information processing standards\nor what FIPS stands for in the US.\n\n384\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.602\nOutside the US most governments\nwill have their own standards and\n\n385\n00:18:57.602 --> 00:19:00.020\nNIST maybe a reference point for you here.\n\n386\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.950\nISO may be a reference point for you here.\n\n387\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.390\nSo these are things just to consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n388\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.370\nBut again, we wanna be aware of\nthis kind of stuff because it is\n\n389\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.990\nan important part of what we do.\n\n390\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.290\nRemember, the more knowledge we bring\nto the table as a forensic investigator\n\n391\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.000\nof standards and approaches and\nmethodologies, mechanisms,\n\n392\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.980\ntools, etcetera.\n\n393\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.650\nThe more likely it is we're gonna be\nsuccessful in answering the burning\n\n394\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.500\nquestions around what happened and\nhow did it happen.\n\n395\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.920\nWhy and under what circumstances will\nbe able to tell those compelling\n\n396\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.660\nstories because we'll have\nthe tools at our disposal\n\n397\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.490\nto make sense of the data\nthat we're seeing.\n\n398\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.680\nIt's a big jigsaw puzzle.\n\n399\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.173\nAnd when we think about\ndoing investigations,\n\n400\n00:19:37.173 --> 00:19:41.036\nwe really are thinking about dumping\nthe pieces of the jigsaw puzzle out of\n\n401\n00:19:41.036 --> 00:19:43.170\nthe box in some random scattered order.\n\n402\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.226\nBut the problem is, unlike in the real\nworld where we have a jigsaw puzzle that\n\n403\n00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:49.379\ncomes in the box with a completed picture\nso we understand what it's supposed to\n\n404\n00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:51.830\nlook like,\nwe don't have that completed picture.\n\n405\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.830\nAll we have are pieces and\nwe may actually be missing pieces.\n\n406\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.180\nMore often than not, we usually are.\n\n407\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.330\nSo we don't even have the complete\nset of pieces to build the puzzle,\n\n408\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.340\nlet alone what the end\ngame should look like, and\n\n409\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.340\nthe reference point to work backwards and\nreverse engineer it back into a picture.\n\n410\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.730\nAll we have are a seemingly\nrandom set of associated, or\n\n411\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.815\nperhaps in some respects, disassociated\nfacts, and we have to make sense of them.\n\n412\n00:20:12.815 --> 00:20:16.620\nAnd that's very difficult to do\nunder the best of circumstances, it\n\n413\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.490\nis almost impossible to do when you start\nremoving key pieces of the puzzle and\n\n414\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.740\nknowledge elements that\nwould shine light on them.\n\n415\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.710\nHence, the more educated we are,\n\n416\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.290\nthe more likely it is that we would be\nsuccessful and it's very important.\n\n417\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.470\nMost successful people I've seen\nthat do this professionally\n\n418\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.800\nin the real world are the people that have\nthe kinds of backgrounds that we have\n\n419\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.700\nbeen talking about.\n\n420\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.970\nThey are deeply knowledgable\nabout networking and hardware and\n\n421\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.580\nsecurity as a framework and\na set of references\n\n422\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.320\nbefore they ever get knowledgeable about\nthe forensic investigative process.\n\n423\n00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.590\nIt's not hard to learn how to do something\nfrom a forensically sound perspective.\n\n424\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.530\nIt's incredibly hard to understand\nthe reasons why it works the way it does,\n\n425\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.650\nthe system is what I'm talking about and\n\n426\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.530\nthen to examine it from\na forensically sound perspective.\n\n427\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.380\nSo as crazy as it sounds,\n\n428\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.760\nbaseline skills like A+, Network+,\nSecurity+ on the CompTIA side.\n\n429\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.930\nThese days cloud skills and\nvirtualization skills.\n\n430\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.690\nThe addition of platform specific\nskills as we've been talking about.\n\n431\n00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.090\nWindows, Linux, et cetera.\n\n432\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.570\nThose things are all prerequisites and\n\n433\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.695\nbuilding blocks for you to become\na really good forensic investigator.\n\n434\n00:21:20.695 --> 00:21:22.940\nYou can go to school and\nlearn the mechanics, the bells and\n\n435\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.460\nwhistles and the step by step\nprocesses of computer forensics.\n\n436\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.370\nNot suggesting you can't be taught that,\nbut\n\n437\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.330\nbeing taught that without all\nthe prerequisite background knowledge\n\n438\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.060\nIs unfortunately just not\ngonna make you as effective.\n\n439\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.250\nThat's the reality.\n\n440\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.860\nSomebody says to you, hey,\nI need you to go examine that router, and\n\n441\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.280\nfigure out whether or\nnot the router was compromised.\n\n442\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.020\nIf you don't know enough about Cisco,\nor Juniper, or Alcatel, or\n\n443\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.095\nwhoever the router was made by.\n\n444\n00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.645\nIf you don't know those platforms,\n\n445\n00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.765\na router's a router is what\nyou're thinking, right?\n\n446\n00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:51.375\nWell no, routers are routers, yes.\n\n447\n00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:53.285\nBut aside from the fact that they are,\n\n448\n00:21:53.285 --> 00:21:56.355\nthe operating systems that run inside\nof them are unique to the vendor.\n\n449\n00:21:56.355 --> 00:21:59.935\nAnd the version of that OS is gonna have\nunique support capabilities and tools.\n\n450\n00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:01.285\nAnd you gotta know those things.\n\n451\n00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:03.865\nWe come back to this idea of\nbringing those experts in, and\n\n452\n00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:08.110\ngetting that specific knowledge, that\ndeep well of knowledge available to you\n\n453\n00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.450\nto be able to have those people\noperate on those systems.\n\n454\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.700\nYou get one shot at getting it right or\nwrong is what we often say in the trade,\n\n455\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.600\nand you wanna plan to be successful,\nnot plan to fail, right.\n\n456\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.240\nThose oops moments we all have,\ndon't wanna have those.\n\n457\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.240\nYou don't get a second chance to go back\nand say, hey, could you break it again and\n\n458\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.450\nthis time I'll actually\ndo it the right way?\n\n459\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.340\nThat will happen, by the way I promise\nyou, because if you screw up the first\n\n460\n00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.760\ntime, they're gonna come back and\nbreak in again, but\n\n461\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.370\nyou're probably not gonna be any better\nprepared to stop them the second time.\n\n462\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.130\nAnd of course that's a negative outcome,\nright, we don't want that to happen.\n\n463\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.730\n&gt;&gt; If I screw up I'm just gonna say, hey\nAdam, can you sit here for a second, and\n\n464\n00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:40.840\nthen go, what did you do?\n\n465\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.420\n&gt;&gt; Could you put your finger print right\nthere, just touch that, I need you to-\n\n466\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.190\n&gt;&gt; What have you done?\n\n467\n00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.783\nI need you to validate that\nthat is the case, right.\n\n468\n00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:52.010\nAnd so it is really important for\nus to just be thinking about that.\n\n469\n00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.030\nAll right, so where do find equipment,\n\n470\n00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.800\nwhere do we go to find\nequipment that we may need?\n\n471\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.230\nThat's a burning question that\ngets asked us all the time.\n\n472\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.820\nWhere do you go to find one,\n\n473\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.340\nwell Daniel was actually doing\na little research in that episode.\n\n474\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.930\nI saw him as I was talking,\nhe was on there, on Google and\n\n475\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.930\nfound a whole bunch of right blockers.\n\n476\n00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.315\nA couple of hundred bucks, you said?\n\n477\n00:23:10.315 --> 00:23:11.214\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; To a couple of thousand, right?\n\n478\n00:23:11.214 --> 00:23:15.340\nA good high-end write blocker costs\nyou $3,000 or $4,000 today US.\n\n479\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.570\nAs I said, the elementary\nbuild-your-own write blocker kit\n\n480\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.350\ncosts you about 100 bucks today, right?\n\n481\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.400\nYou wanna be on the upper end\nof that scale, by the way,\n\n482\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.750\nright, as you're building\na professional tool kit.\n\n483\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.460\nSo let's take a look at just\nrandomly some websites that\n\n484\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.330\nwill provide some background for you.\n\n485\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.630\nIn no way endorsing or saying this\ncompany is better than any other.\n\n486\n00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.330\nIn no way endorsing or\nsaying you gotta go here.\n\n487\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.885\nYou can't go anywhere or else,\njust pulling up some companies\n\n488\n00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:41.775\nthat are well known and that certainly\nprovide this set of resources and\n\n489\n00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:44.585\ntools and leaving it up to you to\ndecide what you wanna do from there.\n\n490\n00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:46.931\nBut, things like digital intelligence,\n\n491\n00:23:46.931 --> 00:23:51.242\nthey do provide a great amount of the kind\nof tools we have been looking at here.\n\n492\n00:23:51.242 --> 00:23:55.070\nSo you can see that they've got\ndifferent kinds of cables and\n\n493\n00:23:55.070 --> 00:24:00.188\ndifferent kinds of Adapters and plugs that\ncan be use in order to connect things.\n\n494\n00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:02.520\nDo we need to stupid stuff\nlike I was talking about.\n\n495\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.210\nYou need clean networking cables.\n\n496\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.730\nYou need console cables,\nDB9 connectors, all that kind of stuff.\n\n497\n00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.540\nAnd you gotta have your own set of\nthese things wired in to the forensic\n\n498\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.600\nenvironment so that everything is gonna\nbe consistent and is clean and certified.\n\n499\n00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.420\nYou can't just go to the client side and\n\n500\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.610\nsay let me use the cabling on\nthe system that the hacker broke into.\n\n501\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.700\nWho knows what's in there?\n\n502\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.990\nYou don't know if those\ncables have been swapped, and\n\n503\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.230\nthere's a keystroke logger\nin the hardware interface.\n\n504\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.780\nYou don't know if there's malware.\n\n505\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.300\nI'm not suggesting that would be the case.\n\n506\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.860\nI'm not suggesting that it's likely.\n\n507\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.760\nBut I am suggesting its possible.\n\n508\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.230\nAnd you can, at that point,\n\n509\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.140\njust say goodbye to any hope of being able\nto forensically examine anything, right?\n\n510\n00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.720\nYou need hard drive cables.\n\n511\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.620\nHow many times have you had to go in and\nfigure out how to cable up a hard drive?\n\n512\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.490\nProbably, not very often these days\ncuz everything is prepackaged,\n\n513\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.410\nit comes set up.\n\n514\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.170\nBut if you're examining a system,\n\n515\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.830\nyou may have to remove the hard drives\nphysically out of those systems.\n\n516\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.560\nCuz if it's rack mounted right like\nwhat we got sitting behind us here.\n\n517\n00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.620\nYou're not gonna, I mean literally\nyou could encumber the entire rack.\n\n518\n00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.420\nPut a big evidence sign on the door and\nsay nobody goes in and\n\n519\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.050\nthat stuff doesn't move\ncuz it's fixed assets.\n\n520\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.080\nBut you're not gonna\ntransport your lab here.\n\n521\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.881\nYou're gonna have to take this stuff and\nunrack it and take it there.\n\n522\n00:25:12.881 --> 00:25:14.560\nYou gotta have cables for all this stuff.\n\n523\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.500\nYou gotta be able to hook all this\nstuff up when you build these toolkits,\n\n524\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.350\nyou're building two kinds.\n\n525\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.760\nYou're building a fixed\nset of tools into a lab,\n\n526\n00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.440\nand you're building a mobile\ntoolkit that will be used on site.\n\n527\n00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.090\nYou may have to plug into and\nlike I said an SD card, and\n\n528\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.910\nget the contents off that SD card\nbefore you power down the device.\n\n529\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.240\nSo, you've gotta have the cables\nto capture that information.\n\n530\n00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.910\nRight?\nSometimes you'll find hard drives\n\n531\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.510\nthat are disembodied, right?\n\n532\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.370\nSomebody's broken a whole bunch of\ncomputers open looking for a specific one,\n\n533\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.290\nand they scatter the hard drives,\njust leave them on the floor.\n\n534\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.950\nYou got to pick those things\nup after you identify them.\n\n535\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.140\nAnd you're gonna have to then take them\nback to the lab, plug them in, and\n\n536\n00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.370\nfind out what's on them, right?\n\n537\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.140\nI mean,\nthis is the kind of stuff that happens.\n\n538\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.460\nSo you got to know about this kind of\nstuff and know where to find this.\n\n539\n00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.790\nSo, yeah, you could see here\njust as I'm scrolling through,\n\n540\n00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:05.000\ngot all sorts of cables and connectors,\nand ribbon cables, and you name it.\n\n541\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.210\nAll sorts of stuff that's here, right?\n\n542\n00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.081\nDifferent kinds of connectors, molex.\n\n543\n00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:10.628\nAll sorts of different stuff for here.\n\n544\n00:26:10.628 --> 00:26:14.150\nThese are molex power cables, if you're\nnot familiar with what those are.\n\n545\n00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.130\nSo you got a whole bunch\nof different stuff.\n\n546\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.490\nWhat about something like logicube, again,\nthis is hard drive the duplication and\n\n547\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.490\nthe duplication forensic\nimaging solutions capability.\n\n548\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.860\nSo hardware, software systems to do this.\n\n549\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.240\nAgain just one company of many\nto do this but you can see here,\n\n550\n00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.160\nhere they've got a [INAUDIBLE]\nthe learning page.\n\n551\n00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.810\nLet's go in, let's go to forensic\nsolutions we'll see they've got\n\n552\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.940\nspecific software and\npackages you can use.\n\n553\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.850\nHard drive duplicators, so\nOmni Scozzi one to one.\n\n554\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.605\nLet's go for the really sexy,\nexciting and cool sounding ones.\n\n555\n00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:51.195\nSupersonic NG,\nthat sounds like it could be cool,\n\n556\n00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:56.660\nright or, we could go the Z Clone XI,\nwhich one do you think?\n\n557\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.623\n&gt;&gt; Let's go Supersonic.\n\n558\n00:26:57.623 --> 00:27:00.334\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe'll do the Supersonic one [LAUGH] So,\n\n559\n00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:03.820\nthere's the hard drive\nduplicator right there, right?\n\n560\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.170\nSo, you basically plug in on the other\nside, kinda assumed, and just click here,\n\n561\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.570\nwe're gonna probably bring this up.\n\n562\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.624\nSo, you'll see\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n563\n00:27:10.624 --> 00:27:12.056\n&gt;&gt; I love those.\n\n564\n00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:15.630\n&gt;&gt; But, let me show it to you, but it's\ngonna be smaller than it was on the page.\n\n565\n00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.472\nBut, you can see the idea that\nwe do have two hard drives here,\n\n566\n00:27:18.472 --> 00:27:20.240\nthere's of cable to the box.\n\n567\n00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.540\nAnd you're going from one to the other,\nand the box provides the electronics and\n\n568\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.830\nthe guts to do the transfer forensically\nwith right back protection and\n\n569\n00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.090\nthings like that, right?\n\n570\n00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.667\nSometimes you hear this octopus and\nso they have multiple connectors.\n\n571\n00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:33.300\nYou could do like up to eight or nine or\n\n572\n00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.990\nten drives at a time on some\nof the more advanced ones.\n\n573\n00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.550\nSo you could see the concept here and\nthe logic of it.\n\n574\n00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.890\nYou wanna go ahead and grab one,\nlet's see how much does it actually cost,\n\n575\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.280\nlet's see if we can get\na quick price on it.\n\n576\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.280\n&gt;&gt; We have to add to cart.\n\n577\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.782\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe could do the add to cart let's see.\n\n578\n00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:50.230\nIt's got all sorts of\naccessories look at that.\n\n579\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.150\nAll right, so yeah we got a little better\nset of pictures down here you can see some\n\n580\n00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.520\nother stuff down here.\n\n581\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.620\nSo yeah,\nyou can get this kind of information and\n\n582\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.730\nthese kinds of capabilities.\n\n583\n00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.461\nYou'll see here this is this hard drive\ncloning at 24 gigs per minute so yeah,\n\n584\n00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:08.750\n24 gigs per minute,\nthat's pretty fast so you think about.\n\n585\n00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.200\nVery, very large drive or\nterabyte drive or\n\n586\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.800\nmultiple terabytes today drives that may\nactually be still a fair amount of time.\n\n587\n00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.630\nLets see.\n&gt;&gt; Looks like their running about $2000.\n\n588\n00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:23.041\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna add to the cart and\nsee.what that looks like $2051 US.\n\n589\n00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:26.325\nNor kind of hovering around that but\nlets take five.\n\n590\n00:28:26.325 --> 00:28:28.384\n[CROSSTALK] Let's get five of those.\n\n591\n00:28:28.384 --> 00:28:30.560\n&gt;&gt; End of the month,\nlet's make somebody happy, right?\n\n592\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.610\nLet's see if we can get that\nshipped overnight, right?\n\n593\n00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.904\n&gt;&gt; Salesman hitting his bonus by now.\n\n594\n00:28:34.904 --> 00:28:36.901\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n595\n00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:37.525\n&gt;&gt; So you see that\n\n596\n00:28:37.525 --> 00:28:40.400\nyou're gotta spend money to build\nout this kind of environment.\n\n597\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.420\nI mean, just think about this.\n\n598\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.150\nYou buy one of those for\none, for instance,\n\n599\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.890\nworkstation in a lab,\nyou just spent over $2,000 US.\n\n600\n00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.630\nYou buy one for a mobile kit,\nyou just spent $4,000 US.\n\n601\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.690\nAnd you buy, outfit a lab with four,\nor five workstations,\n\n602\n00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.140\nplus the couple of mobile kits.\n\n603\n00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.450\nYou imagine a law enforcement agency,\nright?\n\n604\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.720\nIt's gonna have a set of forensic\ntechnicians working in a high end lab,\n\n605\n00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.456\nplus mobile kits to go into the field,\nright?\n\n606\n00:29:03.456 --> 00:29:07.567\nThe CSI thought process where you've got\nmobile systems that are gonna be deployed\n\n607\n00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:10.640\nto be able to deal with\nCriminal Investigations on site.\n\n608\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.711\nYou may be spending 30,\n\n609\n00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:14.835\n$40,000 just on drive duplicators\nbefore you can do anything else.\n\n610\n00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:16.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let alone all the other stuff that goes\n\n611\n00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:17.720\nwith that, right?\n\n612\n00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.680\nSo thinking through the logic of that,\n\n613\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.530\nyou're gonna have to\ndeal with a lot of this.\n\n614\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.260\nWhat about the basic software\nneeds associated with a lab?\n\n615\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.090\nWe do need, as we said,\nimaging, conversion analysis,\n\n616\n00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.570\nviewing, monitoring, security.\n\n617\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.620\nAll those things are going to\nbe a part of this process.\n\n618\n00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.380\nAnd if you remember right here,\n\n619\n00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.040\nwe do have the capability to get this\nkind of forensic solutions right.\n\n620\n00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.540\nSo something like CXI forensics right.\n\n621\n00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.150\nWhat you see what this is software\npackages that they have your hardware and\n\n622\n00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.190\nsoftware that they have.\n\n623\n00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.660\nThis one does extreme speed imaging\nin over 50 gigs a minute so\n\n624\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.718\nit's a high end one.\n\n625\n00:29:48.718 --> 00:29:51.760\nNow you could see it's got a little\nbit more associated with it there.\n\n626\n00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.020\nLooks like the control panel for\nsome sort of space craft, right.\n\n627\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.660\nWe got this kind of stuff.\n\n628\n00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.613\nYou can often buy these all in one\nsolutions from a company that will provide\n\n629\n00:30:00.613 --> 00:30:01.940\nthis capability to you.\n\n630\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.400\nSo just wanna be thinking about this,\nright.\n\n631\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.560\nWhat are the steps that we should be\nconsidering as we bring all of this stuff\n\n632\n00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.500\ntogether in the lab that we have to\nreally think about as we get into, or\n\n633\n00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.700\nthink about how we will start up or\nspin up an investigation before it starts.\n\n634\n00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.240\nWe've talked about some\nof these steps already,\n\n635\n00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.860\nbut one of the other things we have to do,\n\n636\n00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.890\nwho are the people that are gonna be\ninvolved in the investigative team?\n\n637\n00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:22.930\nWhat does that team look like?\n\n638\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.510\nWhat are those specialists?\n\n639\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.280\nThose experts that we have to have?\n\n640\n00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.280\nYou know I've talked about\nthis in other shows.\n\n641\n00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.190\nYou know I often think back to the Mission\nImpossible thought process when I think\n\n642\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.080\nabout building the team, because it's\nliterally like getting those specialists,\n\n643\n00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.340\nand putting the picture on the table, and\nsaying I want them, them, those people.\n\n644\n00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.830\nRight, I want to bring them in,\nand then having them join us.\n\n645\n00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.600\nWe need people that are experts\nat evidence management.\n\n646\n00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.410\nWe need people that are experts\nat evidence documentation,\n\n647\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.140\nexperts at presentation of information.\n\n648\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.380\nWe need people in other words that\nknow how to write reports and\n\n649\n00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.510\ncreate graphics and\ndo all that kind of stuff.\n\n650\n00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.990\nWe need people that are experts\nin analysis of data, right so\n\n651\n00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.230\nincident analysis.\n\n652\n00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.330\nWe need incident responders,\n\n653\n00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.660\npeople that train to go in the field and\nbe able to take on a crime scene, tag and\n\n654\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.470\nbag everything, understand it and\ndocument the whole thing.\n\n655\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.100\nWe need people that are gonna be\nexpert at investigation, going out and\n\n656\n00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.114\ninterviewing people, right, and getting\nfirst hand eye witness testimony and\n\n657\n00:31:15.114 --> 00:31:16.710\nyou'll figuring out what went wrong.\n\n658\n00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.950\nWe need people that\nare good at photography,\n\n659\n00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.250\npeople that are gonna be\nable to take pictures.\n\n660\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.730\nRemember I talked to you in one of the\nprior episodes about the fact that a lot\n\n661\n00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.650\nof times these days\n\n662\n00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.480\nwe're using these 3D imaging systems\nthat will map crime scenes for us.\n\n663\n00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.133\nWe need people that\nare trained in how to do that.\n\n664\n00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:33.587\nI mean I don't know about you but I'm sure\nI get figure it out but I wouldn't want to\n\n665\n00:31:33.587 --> 00:31:36.385\nbe the person that is give it\nthe job first time without intrigue.\n\n666\n00:31:36.385 --> 00:31:38.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Going out, setting up a 3D camera.\n\n667\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You put it on the tripod and\n\n668\n00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.800\nwatching a world around,\ntrying to take all the pictures.\n\n669\n00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.930\nI would not be me, right?\n\n670\n00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:43.890\nIt's not what I do.\n\n671\n00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they go into sales.\n\n672\n00:31:44.932 --> 00:31:46.230\nWant to make this look so easy.\n\n673\n00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The demo.\n\n674\n00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like if it work, no problem.\n\n675\n00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.985\nHow could that not work here?\n\n676\n00:31:49.985 --> 00:31:52.620\nRights, you don't want people\nthat are not train doing that.\n\n677\n00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.210\nWhat about legal advice?\n\n678\n00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.370\nMentions mother episodes while you need.\n\n679\n00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.398\nA competent legal team that understands\nthe regulatory environment in\n\n680\n00:31:59.398 --> 00:32:03.080\nthe location, the jurisdiction\nthat you are operating in.\n\n681\n00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.760\nYou got to have access to attorneys,\npeople that can interpret the law for\n\n682\n00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.300\nyou and\ntell you whether it's allowable for\n\n683\n00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.890\nyou to be able to go do whatever\nit is you think you are gonna do.\n\n684\n00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.275\nCan I kick that door open and\ngo into that sealed room back there and\n\n685\n00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:17.001\nfind out what's in there\nwithout a search warrant?\n\n686\n00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:19.000\nRight, I mean you may not\nknow the answer to that.\n\n687\n00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.118\nTrained law enforcement\nprofessionals certainly will.\n\n688\n00:32:22.118 --> 00:32:24.226\nBut that doesn't mean they don't\nmake mistakes, and every so\n\n689\n00:32:24.226 --> 00:32:25.350\noften that they may get it wrong.\n\n690\n00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.973\nJust because they're interpreting\nthe facts on the ground in real time, and\n\n691\n00:32:28.973 --> 00:32:32.819\nmay not have stopped to consider all the\nsubtle legalities associated with this or\n\n692\n00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:34.450\nthat particular exception.\n\n693\n00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.340\nThis is why you need lawyers to\nhelp you figure this stuff out.\n\n694\n00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.930\nSo, it 's very important\nto build that team up, and\n\n695\n00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.880\nhave all those capabilities associated.\n\n696\n00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.660\nAnd available to us when we need them.\n\n697\n00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.878\nThere's a very rich body of law that we've\ntalked about with rules and evidence\n\n698\n00:32:48.878 --> 00:32:53.500\nalready on the forensics laws in the\nUnited States are incredibly complicated,\n\n699\n00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.040\nand you have to be aware of them.\n\n700\n00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.740\nWanna take a look and\njust join me here for just a minute.\n\n701\n00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.476\nSo Federal Rules of Evidence,\nI didn't show you this when we had our\n\n702\n00:33:01.476 --> 00:33:04.068\nFederal Rules of Evidence\nconversation in prior episodes, but\n\n703\n00:33:04.068 --> 00:33:05.373\nyou can go look these things up.\n\n704\n00:33:05.373 --> 00:33:07.390\nThis is the 2017 edition, right?\n\n705\n00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.620\nSo, can look them up by year and get a\ncompilation of them, look them up online.\n\n706\n00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.940\nAgain for the United States,\njust being specific here.\n\n707\n00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.881\nEvery country will have its\nown interpretation of these.\n\n708\n00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:19.930\nAnd you can certainly go out, and figure\nout what they are, and look them up.\n\n709\n00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.770\nBut you can go in and understand.\n\n710\n00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:22.892\nAnd we talked about some of these.\n\n711\n00:33:22.892 --> 00:33:26.968\nWe talked about the 800 series\nof laws around hear-say, right?\n\n712\n00:33:26.968 --> 00:33:29.760\nWe went in and talked about all\nthe different kind of stuff.\n\n713\n00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.620\nWe didn't go into privilege and witnesses.\n\n714\n00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.190\nWe did talk a bit about opinion and\nexpert testimony.\n\n715\n00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.890\nWe talked a little bit about content.\n\n716\n00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.079\nThe 1000 series, item number 10 here,\ncontents of writings, recordings and\n\n717\n00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:41.870\nphotographs.\n\n718\n00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.290\nI went through some of these, or\nthe most important aspects of the laws\n\n719\n00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.670\nin those categories with\nyou in prior episodes.\n\n720\n00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.880\nImportant for you to go back and\nto take a look, to be aware of them.\n\n721\n00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.110\nYou can also take a look at\nthe US Government Publishing Office and\n\n722\n00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.650\nactually get a copy of this information.\n\n723\n00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.410\nLook it up online and\nsee all of the federal rules.\n\n724\n00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.730\nNot just the ones on evidence.\n\n725\n00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.920\nBut there's a whole set of\nforensics laws as well,\n\n726\n00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.330\nseparate from just the Rules of Evidence.\n\n727\n00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.562\nSo we need to be referenced, and you\nwould need to be aware of here as well.\n\n728\n00:34:10.562 --> 00:34:13.290\nIf you give me just a moment I'm just\ngonna bring them up for us here.\n\n729\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.320\nYou can take a look.\n\n730\n00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.310\nSo it would be important for\nus to be able to understand and\n\n731\n00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.780\nhave knowledge of the rules\nthat are listed here, and\n\n732\n00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.620\nsome of the statutory laws\nthat are listed here.\n\n733\n00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.880\nAgain, if you're planning on studying for\nand\n\n734\n00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.200\ntaking the CHFI exam, knowledge of these\nin particular would probably be helpful.\n\n735\n00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.440\nLet's clarify that a little bit.\n\n736\n00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.800\nWhat do we mean by knowledge?\n\n737\n00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.236\nWhat I mean is, it would be helpful for\nyou to know that rule 901 is referred to\n\n738\n00:34:38.236 --> 00:34:41.762\nas a requirement of or for\nauthentication or identification.\n\n739\n00:34:41.762 --> 00:34:43.016\nDo you have to go read that rule?\n\n740\n00:34:43.016 --> 00:34:45.160\nDo you have to understand\nthe intricacy of it?\n\n741\n00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.900\nNo, not unless you're gonna\nbecome a practicing investigator\n\n742\n00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.910\nthat's gonna be on the hook for\nmaking sure you abide by it.\n\n743\n00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.160\nBut the first step is you've\ngotta go get the knowledge.\n\n744\n00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.560\nSecond step is you gotta\ndecide you wana certify.\n\n745\n00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.630\nThird, fourth, fifth steps are, you go\nout, get trained and get, ultimately,\n\n746\n00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.370\na job in our industry.\n\n747\n00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.220\nWe're at the very beginning\nof that journey, right?\n\n748\n00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.310\nWe're talking about the knowledge in\nhelping you to acquire it in preparation\n\n749\n00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.610\nmost likely for step two.\n\n750\n00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:10.574\nHopefully going out and getting certified,\nI would if I was you make flashcards.\n\n751\n00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:13.833\nIt's a great way to review this material,\ngo through the flashcards,\n\n752\n00:35:13.833 --> 00:35:15.478\nhey what's rule number 1003?\n\n753\n00:35:15.478 --> 00:35:18.048\nAdmissibility of duplicates,\nwhat's rule 1002?\n\n754\n00:35:18.048 --> 00:35:19.299\nRequirement of originals.\n\n755\n00:35:19.299 --> 00:35:21.847\nYou should be able to crank\nthose off on an exam.\n\n756\n00:35:21.847 --> 00:35:26.071\nI can imagine something like a drag and\ndrop environment where you may have a list\n\n757\n00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:28.890\nof rules on one side,\ndefinitions on the other.\n\n758\n00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.170\nGotta match the two.\n\n759\n00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.260\nI can imagine multiple choice questions.\n\n760\n00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.230\nI can imagine a lot of\nways of applying this.\n\n761\n00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.630\nI can imagine a scenario,\n\n762\n00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:40.350\nword based question where you're given\nsome sort of paragraph of information.\n\n763\n00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.290\nAnd you're ask to then pick the most\nappropriate rule that would deal with\n\n764\n00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.310\nthe issue involved.\n\n765\n00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.230\nSo lots of ways I can\nsee applying knowledge.\n\n766\n00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.420\nImportant for you to be aware of them.\n\n767\n00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.770\nPut the list back up, please.\n\n768\n00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:54.330\nLet's just take a look and make sure that\nyou have ample opportunity to study this,\n\n769\n00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.610\nand certainly be aware of it.\n\n770\n00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.440\nSo fraud and related activities\nin connection with access,\n\n771\n00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.960\nin connection with computers,\nprohibiting malicious mischief, right?\n\n772\n00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.100\nRelevant evidence generally admissible,\nirrelevant evidence that's inadmissible.\n\n773\n00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.215\nYou are irrelevant, Sir,\nyou are no longer admissible.\n\n774\n00:36:08.215 --> 00:36:10.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember Dog Day Afternoon?\n\n775\n00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're out of order,\n\n776\n00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:12.569\nno you're out of order.\n\n777\n00:36:12.569 --> 00:36:13.580\n&gt;&gt; That was a great movie.\n\n778\n00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of his best.\n\n779\n00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n780\n00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.380\n&gt;&gt; One of his, that and Scent of a Woman.\n\n781\n00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.060\n&gt;&gt; That was a good movie.\n\n782\n00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.240\nScent of a Woman.\n\n783\n00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.590\nThat was a good movie, too.\n\n784\n00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.080\n&gt;&gt; The Devil's Advocate.\n\n785\n00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I liked The Devil's Advocate.\n\n786\n00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.281\nBut I just have this whole\nissue with Keanu Reeves.\n\n787\n00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:27.608\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We talked about that, right?\n\n788\n00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:29.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I fundamentally just have a problem.\n\n789\n00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Apparently he doesn't age.\n\n790\n00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.776\n&gt;&gt; He does not.\n&gt;&gt; He's one of those people that, yeah.\n\n791\n00:36:31.776 --> 00:36:33.558\n&gt;&gt; And we agree,\nJohn Wick has been a good vehicle for him.\n\n792\n00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, come on.\n\n793\n00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.195\n&gt;&gt; But I just feel like some of his stuff,\nI just,\n\n794\n00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.770\nyeah, I'm-\n&gt;&gt; You're probably not alone in\n\n795\n00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.350\nthat assessment.\n\n796\n00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think I am,\nI think a lot of people are.\n\n797\n00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.620\nI'm not saying he's a bad actor,\nhe's a decent actor, but he's-\n\n798\n00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.260\n&gt;&gt; He has this niche.\n\n799\n00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's just,\nhe's good for certain things.\n\n800\n00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:50.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n801\n00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.560\nthat's the best way to put that,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n802\n00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.250\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n803\n00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.843\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ngetting back to where we were.\n\n804\n00:36:54.843 --> 00:36:59.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so who else could relate?\n\n805\n00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.745\nThree movies over the span\nof about 15 years.\n\n806\n00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:03.390\nTo Forensic Rules of Evidence.\n\n807\n00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.513\n&gt;&gt; Just the dynamic duo here.\n\n808\n00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:06.082\n&gt;&gt; Only Daniel and I.\n\n809\n00:37:06.082 --> 00:37:08.172\nNo where else will you\nfind that level of detail.\n\n810\n00:37:08.172 --> 00:37:11.140\nAll right, so just make sure\nthat you're able to go through.\n\n811\n00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.810\nMake sure you are familiar\nwith these rules.\n\n812\n00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.295\nAgain, I just showed you a couple of\nwebsites where you can look them up and\n\n813\n00:37:15.295 --> 00:37:16.860\nget more detail if you're interested.\n\n814\n00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.160\nCertainly wanna go out and do that.\n\n815\n00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.060\nIf you have a legitimate reason, and\nare just interested in reading up on them,\n\n816\n00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.360\nI'm gonna encourage you to do so, but\nkeep in mind as I specified for the exam.\n\n817\n00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.231\nJust knowing the specific name and the\nrule number associated would be enough to\n\n818\n00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:32.117\nget you over that particular hurdle for\nwhat we're talking about here, okay?\n\n819\n00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Adam, great.\n\n820\n00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.123\nLook at, beginning to look at what\nour forensics lab might look like.\n\n821\n00:37:37.123 --> 00:37:39.650\nSome of the tools involved\nthat we might be using.\n\n822\n00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.545\nHow we can actually acquire those tools.\n\n823\n00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:44.430\nAnd even some of the software, and\n\n824\n00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.785\nthen starting to scratch the surface as\nwell on some of the laws that we're gonna\n\n825\n00:37:48.785 --> 00:37:52.900\nbe held accountable to if we do engage\nthis as a practice, and a business.\n\n826\n00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.840\nSo be aware of what those are.\n\n827\n00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.580\nMake sure you run down that list and\nget familiarized with that.\n\n828\n00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.490\nSo that you can answer questions\nbased on to them on your exam.\n\n829\n00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.990\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n830\n00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.960\nBut there is more to come so stick with\nus and join us back for part three.\n\n831\n00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.886\nAs for this episode, we're gonna go\nahead and sign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n832\n00:38:10.886 --> 00:38:12.830\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n833\n00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.136\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n834\n00:38:14.136 --> 00:38:15.120\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n835\n00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:22.109\n[MUSIC]\n\n836\n00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:23.990\nThank you for watching IT Pro

00:00:13.733\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:19.017\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we're\n\n8\n00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:24.207\ncoming back at you with more\non our CHFI Version 9 series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:28.579\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio to\nlend his expert knowledge on that topic,\n\n10\n00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.530\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.710\nAdam, glad to have you again,\nand how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always going well,\ngood to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.510\nYou know what we need?\n\n14\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.580\nWhen you say exciting, we need confetti.\n\n15\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.244\n&gt;&gt; I would love,\nI said I've been begging for pyro, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need some pyro,\nwe need all that, we gotta work on that.\n\n17\n00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:45.510\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be good.\n\n18\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.400\nWell we'll bring that to you in\na future episode but not today.\n\n19\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.440\nFor today and right now we're gonna\ncontinue our conversations but\n\n20\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.240\ntalk about something very, very important\nto the forensic investigative process,\n\n21\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.105\nwhich is awareness of and\nmanagement of risk.\n\n22\n00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:59.440\nI eluded to this in our last episode.\n\n23\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.094\nAnd really jumping back in here with\nthe idea that we have to understand risk\n\n24\n00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:06.691\nassessment as part of what we do in\nthe pre-investigative phase to really\n\n25\n00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.533\nunderstand the logic of how\nwe're going to prepare for and\n\n26\n00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.795\nlaunch ourselves into the next phase,\nthe investigative phase.\n\n27\n00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.583\nWe'll be moving into that as\npart of this conversation.\n\n28\n00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:20.696\nBut if you join me over here in our\npictorial environment, you will see that-\n\n29\n00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:21.645\n&gt;&gt; I just got cold chills.\n\n30\n00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:25.011\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I've done is just simply gone out\n\n31\n00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:29.397\nand used the tool of all tools, the swift\narmy knife of knowledge management,\n\n32\n00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:32.273\nyou know it as Google,\nwe know it as Google as well.\n\n33\n00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:33.974\n&gt;&gt; Goog-le in French.\n\n34\n00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:34.823\n&gt;&gt; Goog-le.\n\n35\n00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.590\nNot Michelle Bub-le, Goog-le.\n\n36\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.134\n&gt;&gt; Which actually takes you to Google.\n\n37\n00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:41.389\nIf you go to google.com.\nG-o-o-g-l-e.com, yeah,\n\n38\n00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.952\nit takes you to Google.\n\n39\n00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:44.288\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n40\n00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.910\nAnd there's probably a good\nreason I did not know that.\n\n41\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.000\nI had something more valuable sitting\nin that knowledge sector in my head.\n\n42\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.716\nSo risk assessment.\n\n43\n00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:57.298\nAnd I'm just kind of having a Googled or\nGoogled for the risk assessment matrix.\n\n44\n00:01:57.298 --> 00:02:00.716\nAnd you can see I just brought up images\nspecific with pictures to show you what\n\n45\n00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:01.460\none looks like.\n\n46\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.840\nI've been over this in other episodes, in\nother discussions, in other topic areas.\n\n47\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.218\nBut I wanted to bring it back up here.\n\n48\n00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:11.940\nI'm just gonna randomly choose one here,\njust click on it for a minute, just so\n\n49\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.872\nwe can see it and take a look at it.\n\n50\n00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:16.830\nAnd you'll see that\na risk-assessment matrix\n\n51\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.470\nis really gonna be a functional tool.\n\n52\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.921\nIt's a very important tool, and a\nfunctional tool that allows us to be able\n\n53\n00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:27.812\nto understand the conceptual idea of how\nwe can define and therefore assess risk.\n\n54\n00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:31.044\nAnd what we have typically in\nthese kind of scenarios and\n\n55\n00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:33.950\nthese tools is an area\nthat measures likelihood.\n\n56\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.340\nWhether likelihood is on the left,\nlikelihood is on the lower right,\n\n57\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.616\ndoesn't matter, likelihood and\nconsequence can switch places,\n\n58\n00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:43.554\nit's really irrelevant just in\nterms of how we rank things.\n\n59\n00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:46.695\nBut we think about something\nthat is likely to happen,\n\n60\n00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:51.690\nperhaps unlikely to happen, highly\nunlikely, or some scale along those lines.\n\n61\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.100\nAnd the consequence area, sometimes also\nreferred to as impact or exposure, you see\n\n62\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.490\nit done different ways, would be slightly\nharmful, harmful, and extremely harmful.\n\n63\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.650\nAnd what we're looking at is\nan ability to then map out\n\n64\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.060\na logical grid where we\ncan place our risks and\n\n65\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.450\nunderstand how impactful they may\nbe based on identification of them.\n\n66\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.450\nAnd so risk assessment and\na risk matrix is very helpful for us.\n\n67\n00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.920\nIf we look at a risk that is\nhighly unlikely to happen, and\n\n68\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.290\nslightly harmful if it does, so\n\n69\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.270\nthese two quadrants where they intersect\nright here in significant risk.\n\n70\n00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.250\nIf we look at that,\nwhat we're looking at, is a risk and\n\n71\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.010\ncolor coding traditionally\nis done as well.\n\n72\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.920\nGreen would be risks that are at\nthe low end of the scale,\n\n73\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.730\nthe red is the risk that is at the upper\nend, far right hand side of the scale,\n\n74\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.810\nmuch more like to impact us or harm us.\n\n75\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.450\nAn insignificant risk, is gonna be\na risk that although it can happen,\n\n76\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.780\nalthough in theory would have some impact.\n\n77\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.420\nIt's gonna be minimally invasive,\nand probably minimal disruptive.\n\n78\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.900\nAnd while we do wanna plan for, and try to\nmitigate, minimize the impact of any risk\n\n79\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.485\nthat we can anticipate,\nwe may not spend a lot of time, and money,\n\n80\n00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.902\nand resources on insignificant risks when\nthere are risks that are in the medium,\n\n81\n00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:08.638\npotentially high category,\nthan can really be problematic for us.\n\n82\n00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:13.773\nAnd as a security professional, as\na forensic investigator what we're doing\n\n83\n00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:18.520\nis trying to categorize and\ntherefore from a probability perspective,\n\n84\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.910\nweigh the impact and the likelihood\nof this risk having occurred.\n\n85\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.915\nAnd therefore, what it would have done,\n\n86\n00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:29.010\nor the currents in the future that may\nhappen and therefore what it would do.\n\n87\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.960\nRemember there's different\nperspectives here.\n\n88\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.120\nAs an investigator we're looking at\nthings that have already occurred.\n\n89\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.440\nAs a potential defender of a network,\n\n90\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.640\na security professional of some\nkind that is trying to proactively\n\n91\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.620\nas opposed to reactively deal with\nissues we're projecting into the future.\n\n92\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.110\nBut that doesn't mean that\ninvestigators don't deal with\n\n93\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.950\nrisks that can occur in real time.\n\n94\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.310\nMeaning, we have a risk and\nwe may override data by using an incorrect\n\n95\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.090\nset of tools to capture data images,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n96\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.120\nWe have a risk of somehow modifying or\nin some\n\n97\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.310\nway nullifying our opportunity to use data\nbecause we don't handle it correctly.\n\n98\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.890\nCalling to question the chain of custody.\n\n99\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.180\nCalling to question the forensic\nintegrity of that data.\n\n100\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.010\nSo there are risks that we face\neveryday doing what we do when\n\n101\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.510\nwe have to categorize, catalog and\nthen manage accordingly.\n\n102\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.860\nSo, when we look at a risk matrix and\na risk assessment solution\n\n103\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.465\nwe're looking at some sort of ordered\nway of understanding our world.\n\n104\n00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:30.533\nNow this can be done with\nnumerical equivalence,\n\n105\n00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:34.520\nyou see scales here that will have low,\nmedium, high.\n\n106\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.455\nSome that are based on number matrices,\none, two, three, one, two, three.\n\n107\n00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:42.255\nOne at the lower left hand\ncorner is an insignificant risk.\n\n108\n00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:45.375\nA nine at the upper right hand corner,\nthree by three,\n\n109\n00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.085\nwould give us a very\nhighly impactful risk.\n\n110\n00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:51.045\nThere's different ways of doing this,\nno right and wrong thought process.\n\n111\n00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:53.805\nAnd you can see there's also\ndifferent color coding as well.\n\n112\n00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:57.865\nWe don't always use reds,\nsometimes we use amber and\n\n113\n00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:00.580\nshades of red as opposed to just red.\n\n114\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.260\nYou may see red, orange, yellow, green,\nit's different ways of doing this.\n\n115\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.390\nSo ultimately the idea is to understand\nthe conceptual framework of the tool as\n\n116\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.170\nopposed to the specificity of just using\nthe tool without understanding it,\n\n117\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.720\nnumber one.\n\n118\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.480\nAnd number two,\naside from the risk assessment matrices,\n\n119\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.480\nthere are risk assessment frameworks and\ntemplates that may be valuable for\n\n120\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.000\nyou as a security professional for you,\nas a forensic professional to be aware of.\n\n121\n00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.114\nAgain, all I did in this case,\nbeing even handed and equal.\n\n122\n00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:28.476\nRight, so went out and\n\n123\n00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:32.716\nused Bing instead of Google because\nwe want to give equal play to both.\n\n124\n00:06:32.716 --> 00:06:38.237\nAnd so the risk assessment search I did\nhere, NIST, risk assessment template,\n\n125\n00:06:38.237 --> 00:06:43.189\nand you'll see that we get links to\nsome of the NIST documentation on risk\n\n126\n00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.598\nmanagement but also templates\nthat can be downloaded and used.\n\n127\n00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:52.290\nThe NIST SP853 V4 security assessment\ntemplate which is used by the US federal\n\n128\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.778\ngovernment and many agencies in the US to\nbe able to do their risk assessment and\n\n129\n00:06:56.778 --> 00:06:58.350\nalign with FIP standards.\n\n130\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.482\nThe risk framework more broadly is used\nboth in the US and many countries and\n\n131\n00:07:02.482 --> 00:07:04.800\nmany businesses around the world today.\n\n132\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.560\nIt's become more and more the accepted,\nor one of the accepted standard\n\n133\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.580\nreference points for risk management\nin the security world today.\n\n134\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.120\nSo it's something to be aware of.\n\n135\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.734\nA Risk Assessment Report Template\nfrom EUI.\n\n136\n00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:20.122\nThere's different links here you can\nfind for a variety of different things.\n\n137\n00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:24.888\nAnd it would not be a bad idea for you\ntake a look at some of these just to have\n\n138\n00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:28.093\na sense of how the thought\nprocess around risk and\n\n139\n00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:32.492\nrisk assessment will back fill and\nback flow into our dialog here.\n\n140\n00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:36.777\nIt's a much broader conversation than just\none episode here and just one thought\n\n141\n00:07:36.777 --> 00:07:40.181\nprocess among many knowledge items\nin the CHFI knowledge base or\n\n142\n00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:44.486\nin the referenceable amount of material\nthat we talk about with regards to CHFI.\n\n143\n00:07:44.486 --> 00:07:46.210\nBut I just wanna spend\nat least a minute or\n\n144\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.103\ntwo just talking through\nthe logic of this.\n\n145\n00:07:48.103 --> 00:07:52.396\nIf we don't have a guideline or\nsubstandards, frameworks, templates,\n\n146\n00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:56.820\nthings like that to work with and to\naccess risk through, that's not to say we\n\n147\n00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.475\ncan't be successful, it's not to say\nthat risk assessment will not valuable.\n\n148\n00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:05.369\nBut what may happen is that we may\nmiss Obvious and standardized ways of\n\n149\n00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:08.804\npresenting information, so\nthat more people can interact.\n\n150\n00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:13.053\nAnd therefore, get broader coverage and\nvalue out of the information we provide,\n\n151\n00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:14.190\nnumber one.\n\n152\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.780\nNumber two, we may not be able\nto share those results and\n\n153\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.330\npass them around inside of a community\nthat could help to interpret and\n\n154\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.510\nassess them,\nbecause they're not standardized.\n\n155\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.450\nSo these things are very important.\n\n156\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.603\nAnd if we're gonna be calling in experts\nand third-party professionals to help us\n\n157\n00:08:30.603 --> 00:08:33.166\neither do an assessment or\ninterpret the results.\n\n158\n00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:36.309\nOr validate them through pen testing,\npenetration testing, or\n\n159\n00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.367\nvulnerability assessments, or whatever we\nmay be doing to push on those results and\n\n160\n00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:42.900\nreally validate whether or\nnot they're accurate.\n\n161\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.969\nA little bit broader outside the general\nnarrowly defined framework of\n\n162\n00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:49.130\ninvestigation and forensics.\n\n163\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.420\nMore broadly, in information\nmanagement and security overall.\n\n164\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.940\nWe have to standardize our\napproach in our documentation and\n\n165\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.600\nour language around risk, so\nthat everybody that's gonna\n\n166\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.450\nwork on this project understands what\nwe mean when we say a vulnerability.\n\n167\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.490\nWhen Daniel and I talk about security,\nwe talk about vulnerabilities.\n\n168\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.337\nWe often go out of our way\nto be very specific and\n\n169\n00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:10.258\nto be very detailed around\nour use of language.\n\n170\n00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:14.132\nAnd I always will backtrack and say look,\na vulnerability is also weakness.\n\n171\n00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:17.907\nAnd these two terms are synonymous and you\noften hear them referred to either way.\n\n172\n00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:21.361\nAnd we try to spread that knowledge and\nmake you aware of those equivalencies,\n\n173\n00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.170\nbecause it is important as\na frame of reference, right?\n\n174\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.180\nLanguage is how we create context.\n\n175\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.980\nAnd context, frame of reference,\n\n176\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.200\nis how we then share commonalities and\ncreate culture.\n\n177\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.810\nAnd we really are talking about\ncreating culture of awareness and\n\n178\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.270\na culture of security\nwithin the organization.\n\n179\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.259\nSo that we understand when\nthings are going well but\n\n180\n00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:40.488\nwe also understand where\nthere's deviation from norm.\n\n181\n00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:42.927\nAnd those are the areas that\nwe want to focus on and\n\n182\n00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:46.570\nreally probe as an investigator or\nas a security professional.\n\n183\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.080\nLooking for differences that may\nlead to things that are going\n\n184\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.940\non behind our back without our\nknowledge that are inappropriate.\n\n185\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.627\nAnd that's what we're here to talk about.\n\n186\n00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:58.409\nSo really understand the lexicon or\nvocabulary of security is so critical to\n\n187\n00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:02.500\nyour ability to be successful in any of\nthese topics, any area that we talk about.\n\n188\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.787\nAnd risk assessment, and\nthe understanding of management of risk,\n\n189\n00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:06.895\nis one of those areas.\n\n190\n00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:09.020\nIt's very, very important for you.\n\n191\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.563\nWhether you work as an entry\nlevel position, perhaps,\n\n192\n00:10:11.563 --> 00:10:13.576\nin a help desk somewhere\njust starting out.\n\n193\n00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:16.329\nMaybe you've been doing this for\n5, 10, 15, 20,\n\n194\n00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.690\nwho knows how many years you're\na more senior network administrator.\n\n195\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.830\nMore senior security professional,\nperhaps an architect or a manager.\n\n196\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.530\nRegardless of what level\nyou are at in your career,\n\n197\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.410\nregardless of what position or\npositions, you may inhabit and\n\n198\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.480\nmay operate in, in terms of your\noperational environment on a daily basis.\n\n199\n00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.922\nKnowledge of the language of security and\nthe broad application of that specificity\n\n200\n00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:42.927\nof language to everything we do to\nstandardize everybody's approaches and\n\n201\n00:10:42.927 --> 00:10:46.510\ninteractions is one of the most\nimportant things we can talk about.\n\n202\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.008\nOne of the most important ideas we can\nshare with you with regards to helping you\n\n203\n00:10:50.008 --> 00:10:51.280\nto be better at what you do and\n\n204\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.940\nto learn how to become that\nprofessional that you wanna be.\n\n205\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.950\nSo it's very important concept for you.\n\n206\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.018\nSo awareness of risk in risk assessment,\nrisk management steps,\n\n207\n00:10:59.018 --> 00:11:00.074\nare gonna be crucial.\n\n208\n00:11:00.074 --> 00:11:03.962\nRemember, as I've said before, and\nI'll say again before we move on,\n\n209\n00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:08.059\nthere is and are several standards you\ncan referred to for risk management.\n\n210\n00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:12.283\nBut you may not have a specific one\nset up and chose it in your business,\n\n211\n00:11:12.283 --> 00:11:16.020\nin your vertical,\nin your industry that everybody follows.\n\n212\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.190\nAnd this where we have to be flexible.\n\n213\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.309\nAnd have to understand that while\nthere definitely are right and\n\n214\n00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:25.690\nwrong ways to do certain things, those are\nopen to interpretation based on policy.\n\n215\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.469\nAnd based on standards and regulatory\nrequirements within the operational\n\n216\n00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:32.782\ntheater, the operational environment\nyou are spending time in.\n\n217\n00:11:32.782 --> 00:11:37.232\nPeople that work in the power generation\nindustries around the world, especially in\n\n218\n00:11:37.232 --> 00:11:40.816\nthe nuclear end of that power\ngeneration industry around the world,\n\n219\n00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:44.771\nare gonna have to follow some very\nstringent, very specific guidelines and\n\n220\n00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.660\nrules about risk management.\n\n221\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.520\nAnd regulatory compliance around\nauditing and verification and\n\n222\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.570\nvalidation of those risks in order\nto operate plants effectively.\n\n223\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:58.354\nPeople that work in retail,\nregardless of where you work in the world,\n\n224\n00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:01.400\nhave to follow guidelines, like PCI-DSS.\n\n225\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.451\nIn order to safely process and to be able\nto understand how to work with electronic\n\n226\n00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:09.000\ntransactions, credit card information,\nthings like that.\n\n227\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.410\nPeople in the medical profession, whether\nthey're based in the US and have to follow\n\n228\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.460\nspecifically the HIPAA guidelines, or\nwhether they're based outside the US and\n\n229\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.360\nhave to follow whatever country specific\nguidelines, are appropriate for\n\n230\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.390\nprivacy and the management of patient\ninformation around the world.\n\n231\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.780\nYou have these all of this kinda\nguidance that every vertical,\n\n232\n00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.950\nalmost every industry\nwithout exception has.\n\n233\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.170\nAnd we have to be aware of those\nthings as we talked about.\n\n234\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.230\nBut then there's an overlay, that goes\non top, that binds all that together.\n\n235\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.740\nAnd that's really what risk management and\nrisk assessment helps us to do.\n\n236\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.090\nSo don't undersell the value of that one\nwhen it comes to forensic investigation\n\n237\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.190\nwould be the message.\n\n238\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.120\nAnd understand the country\nspecific framework choice,\n\n239\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.460\nregulatory specific framework choices that\nare made in your industry vertical, and\n\n240\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.340\nbecome deeply knowledgeable about those.\n\n241\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.935\nBut be broadly aware of some\nof the other things that\n\n242\n00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:57.215\nyou can bring to the table here.\n\n243\n00:12:57.215 --> 00:13:00.635\nFor one example, just gonna give you a\nlink to another area that you might wanna\n\n244\n00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:04.385\nfollow up on over time and\nperhaps delve deeper into.\n\n245\n00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:08.937\nWe do have, I know for a fact,\nin the course library here at ITProTV,\n\n246\n00:13:08.937 --> 00:13:14.530\ngreat sets of courses and chosen episodes\naround some of the ISACA certifications.\n\n247\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.922\nCertainly CISA,\nCertified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n248\n00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.682\nCISM, Certified Information\nSystems Manager.\n\n249\n00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:24.782\nThe idea there is that those\nare baseline certifications, and\n\n250\n00:13:24.782 --> 00:13:30.052\nadvanced certifications as well,\naround aspects of the security industry.\n\n251\n00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:34.818\nBut ISACA has other credentials,\nCRISC and CGEIT, two additional ones.\n\n252\n00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:38.510\nCRISC is the certified risk\nmanagement credential specifically.\n\n253\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.270\nAnd CGEIT, the governance credential.\n\n254\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.400\nAnd those are additional\ninteresting areas for\n\n255\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.505\nyou to potentially maybe look at lateral\nto some of the conversations we're having\n\n256\n00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.415\nhere and the skill sets you're building\naround forensic investigation.\n\n257\n00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:54.045\nSo just some additional things to\nconsider as we talk about that.\n\n258\n00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:55.771\nLet's move in to the investigation phase.\n\n259\n00:13:55.771 --> 00:14:00.465\nRemember phase two of our three-phase\nmethodology, pre-investigation,\n\n260\n00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:03.032\ninvestigation, post-investigation.\n\n261\n00:14:03.032 --> 00:14:05.687\nWe've done a good job over\nthe last couple of episodes of\n\n262\n00:14:05.687 --> 00:14:09.871\ncovering the pre-investigative phase,\nbuilding out the lab, acquiring the tools,\n\n263\n00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:12.096\nunderstanding the value\nof risk assessment.\n\n264\n00:14:12.096 --> 00:14:15.998\nWanna move into the investigative\nphase now and better understand or\n\n265\n00:14:15.998 --> 00:14:19.571\nlayout the methodology associated\nwith what goes on here.\n\n266\n00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:21.899\nThis is, now, what we've done our\nplanning, done our due diligence.\n\n267\n00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:26.025\nBuilt out our infrastructure,\nour tools, our teams, our labs.\n\n268\n00:14:26.025 --> 00:14:28.205\nWe're prepared and ready to go.\n\n269\n00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.575\nNow, we're being called\non to actually execute.\n\n270\n00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:33.145\nThat's what the investigative\nphase is gonna be all about, so-\n\n271\n00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Be all about action verbs here.\n\n272\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.111\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna all be about action.\n\n273\n00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:37.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actionable outcomes, right?\n\n274\n00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:38.781\nWe're gonna go investigate.\n\n275\n00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:42.907\nWe're not gonna plan to investigate,\nwe're gonna do the investigation, right?\n\n276\n00:14:42.907 --> 00:14:43.917\nSo how do we investigate a computer crime?\n\n277\n00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:46.547\nThere's a methodology\nassociated with this.\n\n278\n00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:48.292\nWe would be thinking of the logical steps.\n\n279\n00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:52.517\nI'm about to add a few five that I would\ncome up within kinda throw out there for\n\n280\n00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:53.947\nyou as a thought process.\n\n281\n00:14:53.947 --> 00:14:57.607\nDetermine if there has been a incident or\na lot of times, we will get a phone call.\n\n282\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.743\nAs an IT professional, help desk or\nwhatever you may call yourself,\n\n283\n00:15:02.743 --> 00:15:07.625\nservice desk, NOC, EOC, whatever that\ndeclarant variable is in your world that\n\n284\n00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:12.294\nsays hey, call these people, these\nare the superheros that are gonna come and\n\n285\n00:15:12.294 --> 00:15:14.802\nhelp put your world right again, right?\n\n286\n00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:18.313\nAnd so when we interact with those IT\nprofessionals, we're gonna get a phone\n\n287\n00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:21.508\ncall, a ticket to support,\nissue is open, whatever the case may be.\n\n288\n00:15:21.508 --> 00:15:24.710\nAnd somebody says help, something's wrong,\nI think there's a problem.\n\n289\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.736\nWell, yeah, we're definitely gonna\nsend somebody to figure that out.\n\n290\n00:15:26.736 --> 00:15:29.180\nBut do we really know what's going on?\n\n291\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.620\nDo we know if it is an incident?\n\n292\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.890\nDo you know if there has\nbeen a crime committed?\n\n293\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.445\nDo we know if it's something\nthat's important to be aware of or\n\n294\n00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:38.280\nperhaps that's easily dealt with?\n\n295\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.260\nHey, my computer isn't responding,\nsomething's gone wrong.\n\n296\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.360\nMaybe I have malware, let me report that.\n\n297\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.200\nWell, maybe you do, maybe you don't,\nmaybe there's something else going on.\n\n298\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.626\nMaybe a vendor patch has gone wrong.\n\n299\n00:15:48.626 --> 00:15:50.930\nAnd as a result,\nit's rendered the system inoperable but\n\n300\n00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.530\nit has nothing to do with malware.\n\n301\n00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.520\nBut you may not be, as an end user,\nable to assess that.\n\n302\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.160\nYou have to get somebody professionally\nwith those skills to come in and\n\n303\n00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.860\ntake a look, right?\n\n304\n00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.702\nSo very first thing we gotta do\nis determine whether there's been\n\n305\n00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:02.589\nan incident or not.\n\n306\n00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:06.201\nNot because we don't wanna invest the time\nto figure out if there is one, but\n\n307\n00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:08.019\nbecause we wanna use our time wisely.\n\n308\n00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:10.518\nIf it's something we can easily\ndeal with and it's not an incident,\n\n309\n00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:11.951\nwe don't have to call out the Calvary.\n\n310\n00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:14.540\nAnd have an involved incident response.\n\n311\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.507\nYou ever watch Monsters Inc?\n\n312\n00:16:17.507 --> 00:16:18.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back in the day right.\n\n313\n00:16:18.521 --> 00:16:21.635\n&gt;&gt; Mike Wazowski and so.\n\n314\n00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:23.671\nYou remember the first on right,\nwell you have kids so\n\n315\n00:16:23.671 --> 00:16:26.567\nyou should be getting into this kinda\nstuff even if you haven't watched it,\n\n316\n00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:29.850\nbut yeah, if you remember the first one,\nfirst we've started with couple, right?\n\n317\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.550\nBut the first one were the child defense\nagency shows up all the guys in the yellow\n\n318\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.070\nsuits, right?\n\n319\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.370\nThey look like little\nyellow pieces of cake.\n\n320\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n321\n00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:40.164\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\nSo they come down out of a helicopters and\n\n322\n00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:42.267\nit's like if there's a human, right?\n\n323\n00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.893\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They gets another world and so\n\n324\n00:16:43.893 --> 00:16:46.884\nthey just show up out of nowhere\nlike the alarm bells goes off and\n\n325\n00:16:46.884 --> 00:16:49.830\nthere's like a thousands just\nlike agents like everywhere.\n\n326\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.910\nIt's just really funny.\n\n327\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.500\nSo you see that kind of thing we don't\nwanna call out that huge response way,\n\n328\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500\nunless we know for\na fact we have a reason to deploy it.\n\n329\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.460\nSo we gonna make sure we\nknow what were dealing with.\n\n330\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.200\nVery first, very important first and\nforemost, number two, find clues and\n\n331\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.160\nthey even left, left behind, right?\n\n332\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.950\nIf there indeed an incident,\nlet's start looking for clues,\n\n333\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.920\ntrying to figure out what it is and\n\n334\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.530\nwhat we have to address and what\nthe environment is gonna tell us, right?\n\n335\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.930\nHey, there's a roll of duct\ntape sitting over there and\n\n336\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.885\nthere's some cables sitting next to it,\nand there's a sharpie.\n\n337\n00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:21.625\nWell, that may or may not be a set\nof clues we've gotta know, right?\n\n338\n00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:23.685\nMaybe that means something,\nmaybe it doesn't, right?\n\n339\n00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:26.215\nSo we gotta know what's there,\nand assess and\n\n340\n00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:27.825\neliminate things that don't make sense.\n\n341\n00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:30.135\nBut then focus on things\nthat are gonna be important.\n\n342\n00:17:30.135 --> 00:17:32.875\nPreliminary search for evidence, so\nwe've gotta figure out what's there.\n\n343\n00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:35.195\nBy the way, referencing,\nfinding clues left behind.\n\n344\n00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:38.055\nWe talked in prior episodes\nabout not Picard's\n\n345\n00:17:38.055 --> 00:17:39.195\nexchange principle-\n&gt;&gt; No, Locard's.\n\n346\n00:17:39.195 --> 00:17:40.785\n&gt;&gt; But Locard's exchange principle, right?\n\n347\n00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:44.230\nSo The principled exchange\nthat Locard throws out there.\n\n348\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.630\nLocard's Principle of Exchange.\n\n349\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.560\nImportant for finding clues left behind.\n\n350\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.910\nCuz that's gonna help us to be aware\nof the fact that the perpetrator or\n\n351\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.750\nperpetrators of said incident or\n\n352\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.860\ncrime have most likely left something or\nsome group of somethings behind.\n\n353\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.160\nAnd have extracted or\ntaken a group of somethings away.\n\n354\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.970\nAnd we have to balance those scales and\ndo a comparison.\n\n355\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.024\nAnd figure out what was there before,\nwhat's not there now.\n\n356\n00:18:10.024 --> 00:18:13.260\nAnd then as a result, start to figure\nout what may have been the target.\n\n357\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.760\nAnd therefore,\nthe reasons why this thing occurred.\n\n358\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.050\nPreliminary search for evidence.\n\n359\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.190\nNumber three, tag and\nbag all relevant evidence.\n\n360\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.400\nGot to be able to do that,\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n361\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.096\nAnd then transport securely, right?\n\n362\n00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:28.050\nSo, a five stage methodology\nare five set of steps\n\n363\n00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.200\nat a high level summarizing what we\ndo to investigate a computer crime.\n\n364\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.797\nThe important for you to have a sense of\nwhat each one of those steps is gonna\n\n365\n00:18:34.797 --> 00:18:38.454\nfocus on and to speak knowledgeably\nabout the fact that things will occur in\n\n366\n00:18:38.454 --> 00:18:40.730\na certain order with a certain purpose.\n\n367\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.935\nAnd during a certain flow or\nprocess order.\n\n368\n00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:45.910\nWe're expected to do certain\nthings at a certain time.\n\n369\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.120\nIt'd be good for\nyou to have a sense of that.\n\n370\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.080\nYou're planning on taking\nthe CHFI exam at some point or\n\n371\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.450\nany exam under any circumstance for\nany reason.\n\n372\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.630\nWhenever there's a methodology to discuss,\nwhenever there's a general sequential flow\n\n373\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.860\nof items that have to happen and\ncertain things occur as a result of that.\n\n374\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.610\nYou're always, without a doubt, you can\nassume you're gonna get tested on that\n\n375\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.650\nkind of stuff and\nyou gotta be familiar with it.\n\n376\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.195\nOtherwise, why would we bother to\ntake time to teach it to you in\n\n377\n00:19:09.195 --> 00:19:09.924\nthe first place.\n\n378\n00:19:09.924 --> 00:19:12.259\nThere's no value in it if we\ndon't ascertain that you actually\n\n379\n00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.190\nunderstand it, right?\n\n380\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.750\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n381\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.620\nI know you guys are gonna\nbe aware of those things.\n\n382\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.590\nI know you're gonna pay attention to that,\nand you're gonna be just fine and\n\n383\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.730\nbe successful on those\nexams when you take them.\n\n384\n00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.000\nBut it's understanding how\nto plan to be successful,\n\n385\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.550\nthat we're trying to make\nsure you're aware of.\n\n386\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.070\nSo we talked about what your tool kit\nmay look like to build out the forensics\n\n387\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.490\nresponse capabilities in the lab,\n\n388\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.812\nall the hardware that goes in\nthere in the prior episodes.\n\n389\n00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:36.850\nAnd we talked about the fact that\nyou may have more than one toolkit.\n\n390\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.410\nYou would most likely have the lab based\ntoolkit, to kind of fix the assets,\n\n391\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.470\nthe workstations, the desks,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.220\nThen we said, most likely you will\nhave a mobile toolkit as well.\n\n393\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.830\nOne that you throw into the van and\nyour go bag and\n\n394\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.710\nyou are gonna be able to\ntake to a scene and deploy.\n\n395\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:57.730\nMaybe it is heavy lift capability where\nyou have cases of resources you bring out.\n\n396\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.732\nI know you've got the water tight pelican\ncases where you may have certain kinds of\n\n397\n00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:04.052\ngear that has to be\nprotected things like that,\n\n398\n00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:06.330\nsome of this gear as we\nsaid is very expensive.\n\n399\n00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.580\nYou don't want to throw it in\nthe back of your backpack and\n\n400\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.740\nhave it rattle around in the back the car,\nand then have to explain to your boss why\n\n401\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.350\nyou're constantly buying\n$5,000 write blockers, right.\n\n402\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.310\nBecause you're breaking them\nevery time you get in the car.\n\n403\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.660\nSo you gotta make sure you\nstore these things securely.\n\n404\n00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.790\nA lot of the kinda gear that I work with,\nyou know, depending on what it is.\n\n405\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.020\nIn my go bag I'll throw\na couple of laptops, a tablet,\n\n406\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.970\nwhatever it is in a bag.\n\n407\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.790\nI don't worry too much\nabout anything else.\n\n408\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.730\nI just throw them in there and I go.\n\n409\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.120\nBut, you know, for things like network\nanalyzers, for right protectors,\n\n410\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.670\nthings like that If you're\ngonna be traveling with those\n\n411\n00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.340\nyou gotta put it into some sort of\nhard sided case with a foam insert.\n\n412\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.600\nMake sure they're protected, and\nthat they're gonna travel properly.\n\n413\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.480\nThose kinda things are gonna be important.\n\n414\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.370\nMake sure you lock those cases so\nnobody walks off with that stuff.\n\n415\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.420\nAnd opens it up and\nfinds out what they are.\n\n416\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.880\nDid I ever tell you that story\nabout one of my trainers\n\n417\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.780\nthat deployed into the field took\na whole bunch of laptops with him\n\n418\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.530\nto an on sight down in another country.\n\n419\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.930\nAnd we said specifically hey,\n\n420\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.780\nmake sure that we sent them in\ncoffin cases with locks on them.\n\n421\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.420\nMake sure they all go in there and\n\n422\n00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.820\nthat you're not gonna otherwise\nsomebody's gonna walk off with them.\n\n423\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.140\nSo does it on the way down, because we\nhad packed everything, comes back, right?\n\n424\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.150\nShows up at the office,\nwe're missing five laptops.\n\n425\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.190\nWe're like, what happened,\nwhat did you do, right?\n\n426\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.230\nAre they broken,\nwere they stolen out of the hotel?\n\n427\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.930\nNo, no,\nI put them in my luggage on the way back.\n\n428\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.960\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n&gt;&gt; I stuck a few\n\n429\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.270\nof them in my checked luggage, and they\nweren't there when I went through customs.\n\n430\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.160\nWell, duh.\n\n431\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.780\nThey're not there?\n\n432\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.320\nWell that's surprising, right?\n\n433\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.700\nBecause they don't x-ray that stuff and\nsome person, probably on the loading line,\n\n434\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.260\nsaid, look.\n\n435\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.340\nI got five new Christmas presents for\nmy kids, right?\n\n436\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.870\nAnd just helped themselves\nto several laptops.\n\n437\n00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:46.417\nSo that was the first and last time that\nhe got to be able to make a trip like\n\n438\n00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:52.249\nthat to be trusted with the said pieces\nof [CROSSTALK] Information process.\n\n439\n00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:56.652\nWell, you would think but\nnot my decision, not my decision.\n\n440\n00:21:56.652 --> 00:21:59.650\nHad in been my decision made then\ndifferently, but not my decision.\n\n441\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.190\nI just work with a bunch of very\nforgiving people, what can I say.\n\n442\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so keep in mind when\nyou build that tool kit out,\n\n443\n00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.140\nyour gonna have all\nthe tools we talked about.\n\n444\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.380\nAnother thing to keep in mind especially\nfor the mobile deployment capabilities,\n\n445\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.670\nyour probably not gonna have\ninternet access that's reliable and\n\n446\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.530\nthat you can download software with.\n\n447\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.396\nYou gotta travel with everything you need.\n\n448\n00:22:17.396 --> 00:22:20.599\nI remember years ago,\nyou used to walk around\n\n449\n00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:25.225\nwith the little floppy disc binder and\nthe software binders.\n\n450\n00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:27.820\nWe had all the drivers and\nsoftware you needed.\n\n451\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.523\nYou took all that with you because again,\nyou wouldn't be able to\n\n452\n00:22:30.523 --> 00:22:34.013\ndownload traditionally on site and even if\nthere was wireless even if you can use it,\n\n453\n00:22:34.013 --> 00:22:37.720\nyou can't plug in and use those networks\nbecause you don't know what's on them.\n\n454\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.460\nRight?\nYou just, you can't certify\n\n455\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.890\nthat that stuff's not gonna back flow\ninto your systems and infect you.\n\n456\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:43.940\nAnd you can't use it,\n\n457\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.070\nso it's very rare that you're\ngonna have a secure connection.\n\n458\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.275\nI'm not saying you couldn't do, the people\ncarry and set up mobile wireless.\n\n459\n00:22:50.275 --> 00:22:52.805\nHotspots, and all sorts of stuff today,\nbut my point is,\n\n460\n00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:55.895\nyou're not gonna rely on that in the\nfield, and you gotta have all that stuff.\n\n461\n00:22:55.895 --> 00:22:59.790\nSo, the machine has to be loaded with all\nthe tools, you need the ISOs that you may\n\n462\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.344\nneed to have available to you,\nall the media, write protected devices,\n\n463\n00:23:03.344 --> 00:23:07.221\nnetworking equipment, power supplies,\nbatteries, all that kind of stuff.\n\n464\n00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:11.430\nI remember when I was in India I went\nto the Taj Mahal when I was there.\n\n465\n00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.350\nI had a little time to do some sight\nseeing when I was there on business and so\n\n466\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.010\nI used, I don't know if you and\nI've ever talked about this but\n\n467\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.148\nI do a lot of photography in\nthe little bit of spare time I have.\n\n468\n00:23:21.148 --> 00:23:22.595\n[CROSSTALK] Manual SLRs.\n\n469\n00:23:22.595 --> 00:23:26.180\nI use old Canon cameras,\nNikons, things like that.\n\n470\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.180\nI don't use digital cameras for\nthe most part.\n\n471\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.685\nI'm just one of those\nold fashioned purists.\n\n472\n00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:30.652\n&gt;&gt; You're a film shooter.\n\n473\n00:23:30.652 --> 00:23:33.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, and I actually use film which\nyou may or may not know what it is, but\n\n474\n00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:36.979\nit's a the stuff you put in the back\nof those cameras that actually captures\n\n475\n00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:37.800\npictures.\n\n476\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.735\nAnd so, when I'm there I wanted\nto get some black and white film.\n\n477\n00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:44.650\nAnd I wanted to be able to do some\nshots of the Taj Mahal and do all that.\n\n478\n00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.480\nAnd I wanted a certain kind of film,\na certain speed.\n\n479\n00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.270\nBecause of the lighting and\nall that stuff.\n\n480\n00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.710\nSo, it was amazing.\n\n481\n00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.269\nYou know you're in India and I'm thinking\nokay, I'm gonna potentially I did not\n\n482\n00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:56.532\nbring with me, maybe I'm gonna have\na problem finding, not normal film.\n\n483\n00:23:56.532 --> 00:23:58.985\nLike color film, AS 400,\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n484\n00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:03.045\nReally no big deal, but I wanted some\nvery specific what they call t pan or\n\n485\n00:24:03.045 --> 00:24:05.993\ntechnical pan black and\nwhite 100 speed AS film.\n\n486\n00:24:05.993 --> 00:24:09.620\nAnd very difficult to find anywhere\nin the world at that time,\n\n487\n00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.790\nlet alone my thinking right\noutside the Taj Majal.\n\n488\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.820\nBut they have all these\nkids running around because\n\n489\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.080\nthey're trying to earn money.\n\n490\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.630\nAnd so you're not allowed to drive\nby the way, it's very interesting,\n\n491\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.080\nyou're not allowed to drive a car into,\nthere's about a mile or so\n\n492\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.040\nexclusionary zone around the Taj\nbecause of the air pollution.\n\n493\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.910\nSo you have to drive to a certain point,\nyou park,\n\n494\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.370\nand then you take what are called tick\ntocks, these horse carts that people will,\n\n495\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.080\nlike cabs but\nessentially horse drawn carts.\n\n496\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.750\nAnd they take you, and you pay a certain\namount and they'll drive you in, or\n\n497\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.570\nyou can walk, it's up to you.\n\n498\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:40.050\nSo, did that, got off, and then there's\nthis group of, like you see in the movies,\n\n499\n00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.600\nalmost like these little street urchins\nrunning around with these kids,\n\n500\n00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.180\nthey're just constantly coming up to you.\n\n501\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.920\nHey mister, buy this or buy that and they\nsaw I had the camera, like, you need film?\n\n502\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.210\nAnd I say yeah I need film.\n\n503\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.170\nI'll be right back and\nthen he goes of and runs, and\n\n504\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.560\nit's like what are these movies,\nthe guy shows, up like with the coat,\n\n505\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.230\nand he's like all right what\nkind of film do you want.\n\n506\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.100\n&gt;&gt; He's got Rolex watches and film.\n\n507\n00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.960\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, like,\nhey you need cameras, you need a lens?\n\n508\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.090\nI got a lens right here.\n\n509\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.269\nEverything, it was hilarious.\n\n510\n00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:04.016\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome!\n\n511\n00:25:04.016 --> 00:25:06.220\n&gt;&gt; And I saw it,\nthat's exactly what I need.\n\n512\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.400\nI was able to, for like,\n5 bucks US, whatever it was.\n\n513\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.830\nI was able to buy a roll of film\nright off this guy on the street,\n\n514\n00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.740\nlike, out of the trench coat.\n\n515\n00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.589\nIt was hilarious.\n\n516\n00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:13.901\n&gt;&gt; I think we need more of that.\n\n517\n00:25:13.901 --> 00:25:14.647\nLegitimately, obviously.\n\n518\n00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:17.538\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's just-\n&gt;&gt; Very convenient!\n\n519\n00:25:17.538 --> 00:25:19.040\n&gt;&gt; I mean, who can tell a story like that?\n\n520\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.070\nIn today's world, you just never\nsee that outside the movies.\n\n521\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.480\nI actually saw that happen.\n\n522\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.346\nTotally unrelated to what\nwe're here to talk about,\n\n523\n00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:25.510\nstill a cool aside nonetheless.\n\n524\n00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.330\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n525\n00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.036\nBut anyway, you need all these\nkind of stuff, my point is,\n\n526\n00:25:29.036 --> 00:25:30.290\nyou gonna travel with all this.\n\n527\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.770\nIf you don't have this,\nhow are you gonna resume.\n\n528\n00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.587\nBut somebody is gonna show roll up and\nsay, hey buddies, come here,\n\n529\n00:25:35.587 --> 00:25:36.615\nI got your power supply.\n\n530\n00:25:36.615 --> 00:25:38.625\nWhat do you want right here,\nthey're all hanging right here, right?\n\n531\n00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:41.185\nYou just don't see that normally,\nso you gotta be prepared.\n\n532\n00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:43.915\nYou've gotta have all this\nstuff set up and ready to go.\n\n533\n00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:45.625\nI talk about a go-bag all the time but\n\n534\n00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:48.712\nliterally, that's what professionals\nwho do this kind of stuff have.\n\n535\n00:25:48.712 --> 00:25:51.432\nThey have these packs that\nare packed up ready to go.\n\n536\n00:25:51.432 --> 00:25:53.752\nYou deploy them into whatever\nenvironments you need.\n\n537\n00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:57.362\nYou can ship them as I said,\nif you put them into hard containers,\n\n538\n00:25:57.362 --> 00:25:59.670\nif you have to deploy down field or\ndown range.\n\n539\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.570\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n540\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.630\nSo, just be aware of the logic there.\n\n541\n00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.200\nBut it is important for us to be thinking\nabout these kind of things as we continue\n\n542\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.700\nbroadening our conversations getting\ninto the investigation phase\n\n543\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.980\nwe're laying down the markers.\n\n544\n00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.220\nThe parameters on how we're gonna\nstart to deploy into the field and\n\n545\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.870\nbuild out these capabilities.\n\n546\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.550\nAnd then what we're going to do at\nevery step along the way in this\n\n547\n00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.200\nprocess to be able to take\nadvantage of these things, right?\n\n548\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.260\nSometimes you gotta call up and\nsay, hey I need this or\n\n549\n00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.090\nthat because maybe I forgot to bring\nit if somebody can bring it to you.\n\n550\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.855\nBut there may not be Best Buy or\nan HH Gregg or whatever the case may be.\n\n551\n00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:35.265\nWhere you can get something easily and\nquickly.\n\n552\n00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:38.405\nI've been on location doing stuff,\nwhere as stupid as it sounds,\n\n553\n00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:39.825\nwe didn't have double A batteries.\n\n554\n00:26:39.825 --> 00:26:41.315\nAnd nobody had them.\n\n555\n00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:43.990\nAnd the obvious things,\ngetting a mouse, right?\n\n556\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.245\nI joke around sometimes,\ncuz I have, as you can see,\n\n557\n00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:50.705\nan optical mouse assigned to and kinda\nhooked up on my laptop that I demo with\n\n558\n00:26:50.705 --> 00:26:53.770\nbecause of some technical\nreasons we won't go into again.\n\n559\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.160\nBut, because of the way we set this up,\n\n560\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.440\nI have to use the mouse\ninstead of the touch-pad.\n\n561\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.210\nYou would be surprised, the effort it\ntakes to find a USB mouse sometimes,\n\n562\n00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.150\nright, just to be able to hook stuff up,\nforget about PS2 stuff.\n\n563\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that's becoming a rare,\nrare bird anymore.\n\n564\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, and so you know, it is.\n\n565\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.463\nAlthough interestingly, I think we\ntalked about this in another show also,\n\n566\n00:27:13.463 --> 00:27:16.363\nthose mechanical keyboards are making\na comeback because of gaming,\n\n567\n00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:19.231\n[CROSSTALK] because of the tactile\ntouch and the way the keys respond.\n\n568\n00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the way they respond\nback to your fingers.\n\n569\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of springyness,\n\n570\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.760\nand there's actually a huge industry\nnow reproducing those things because so\n\n571\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.320\nmany people want them\n&gt;&gt; It's like a DeLorean, right?\n\n572\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, kinda cool.\n\n573\n00:27:32.528 --> 00:27:35.920\n[LAUGH] Anyway so, we digress.\n\n574\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.552\n&gt;&gt; We digress.\n&gt;&gt; Not too much in this case, but\n\n575\n00:27:37.552 --> 00:27:39.490\nwe are I think out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n576\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're out of time, but\nit's a really good stopping spot for\n\n577\n00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.310\nus because we're gonna pick back\nup with methodology steps and\n\n578\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.160\nthing of that nature.\n\n579\n00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:00:06.758\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:11.622\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:13.734\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.890\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.690\nwell we are coming back with\nmore an RCHFI Version 9 series,\n\n9\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.120\njoining us in studio again, continuing\non with more on our methodologies,\n\n10\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.200\nthat's what we're looking at today,\nis our good friend Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.311\nAdam welcome back, so\nglad to have you again, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:37.353\n&gt;&gt; I'm good and [INAUDIBLE] present\nthe credibly cool thing I have because you\n\n13\n00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:40.492\nsaid we have two methodologies, I actually\nhad a card trick I was gonna do but\n\n14\n00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:43.730\nI just, now I can't do that\n&gt;&gt; Well, what are you going to do?\n\n15\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, not the card trick.\n\n16\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.101\n&gt;&gt; Not the card trick?\n\n17\n00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:45.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I am going to talk\n\n18\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.740\nabout methodology.\n\n19\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.750\nSo fair enough, we are here,\nas Daniel said, in a part four.\n\n20\n00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.567\nBecause there's so much good information,\nwe couldn't do it in three parts.\n\n21\n00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:54.914\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue talking about\n\n22\n00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.660\nour investigative process.\n\n23\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.090\nThat's what we're going through and\ntalking about,\n\n24\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.350\nin this particular group Of episodes\nwe were putting together for you.\n\n25\n00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340\nWe left off getting into\nputting our toe in the water\n\n26\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.510\naround the middle of the three stages.\n\n27\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.470\nWe have the pre-investigative,\nwe're now doing the investigative,\n\n28\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.385\nwe'll be talking about\npost-investigative coming up.\n\n29\n00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:13.805\nOf our process.\n\n30\n00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.835\nWe're gonna now talk about,\nthrow up on the screen here.\n\n31\n00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:19.355\nWe'll put this up in a second for\nyou and start going through this.\n\n32\n00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.615\nThe methodology or\nthe steps that we have to go through.\n\n33\n00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.085\nA very detailed 14 point process and\n\n34\n00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:27.445\na more condensed kinda\nshortened 9 point process\n\n35\n00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:31.275\nset of steps around what the investigative\nmethodology should look like.\n\n36\n00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:33.785\nI previewed these for\nyou in some prior episodes.\n\n37\n00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:38.210\nWe actually went through the exact 14\nstep methodology we're about to take\n\n38\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.040\na look at again.\n\n39\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.950\nBut I didn't really show you the condensed\nversion and spend a lot of time on it.\n\n40\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.360\nSo I wanted to be able to talk about and\n\n41\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.370\nshow you both before we continue working\nthrough some of the other discussions.\n\n42\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.890\nWho's a first responder.\n\n43\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.650\nWhat do they do?\n\n44\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.950\nWhy are they important?\n\n45\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.080\nWhat kind of tools do they have to\nbring to a criminal investigation or\n\n46\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.700\nto a crime site of some kind?\n\n47\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520\nWhy do we need them to be trained?\n\n48\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.170\nWe'll talk about some of\nthose things as we continue.\n\n49\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.430\nWe could take a look.\n\n50\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.115\nWe'll put our methodology up on\nthe screen, and as I said in one of\n\n51\n00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.225\nour prior episodes, we did put this\nexact set of steps or sequences up.\n\n52\n00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:14.285\nI spent some time reminding\nyou of why we may or\n\n53\n00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:17.305\nmay not have an if required\nstatement after some of these.\n\n54\n00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:19.885\nMay or may not need a court\nwarrant we talked about,\n\n55\n00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:23.775\nor a search warrant as we formally\nrefer to it as, and we may or\n\n56\n00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.285\nmay not be called to testify\nas an expert witness.\n\n57\n00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:28.090\nSo we've been through this already.\n\n58\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.850\nJust a couple things to remind ourselves\nof, we do not necessarily need to be able\n\n59\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.250\nto specify that every step in this\nprocess gets followed every time.\n\n60\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.750\nBecause, remember, if we're dealing with\nan incident that turns out to be internal,\n\n61\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.020\nit's not going to involve external law\nenforcement, may not be considered to be\n\n62\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.910\na serious breach, but\nstill needs an instant response.\n\n63\n00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.110\nAnd some sort of overlay\nwith regards to security and\n\n64\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.440\nmaking sure that we've dealt\nwith whatever issues there are.\n\n65\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.770\nWe may shortcut this process and may not\ngo through every step, but if it is gonna\n\n66\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.380\nbe a more formal investigation,\neither leading to criminal and or\n\n67\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.340\ncivil potentialities in terms of a trial\ndown the road and we are gonna have to\n\n68\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.330\nthen ultimately involve most likely the\nexternal law enforcement capabilities or\n\n69\n00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.020\nwhatever those may be in your geography.\n\n70\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.010\nAnd we are going to ultimately have to\npresent evidence and most likely testify.\n\n71\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.010\nThe we are going to be\na little bit more formal and\n\n72\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.710\nfocused on the formality of the stages and\nthe steps.\n\n73\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.520\nSo, you would want to think about that\ngreat way to think about this being\n\n74\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.530\npresented is could you get case study\nquestions or scenario's on a exam where\n\n75\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.900\nyou're asked about which step or steps in\nthe process in what order would be applied\n\n76\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.950\nto deal with this particular phase of\nan incident as we see it unfolding.\n\n77\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.140\nWould you need to understand what\nall 14 steps in the methodology\n\n78\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.710\nare versus the condensed\nsteps right down here.\n\n79\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.350\nAnd really shortening that into\na more portable and therefore more\n\n80\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.960\neasily transmitted, communicated\ntrained on, and discussed set of steps.\n\n81\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.940\nBoth sets ultimately get\nus to the same place,\n\n82\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.340\nall we've done in the condensed version is\nsimply combine some of the steps together.\n\n83\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.675\nInto some easily understood containers\nthat allow us to just be a little bit,\n\n84\n00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:17.200\n[COUGH], more frugal in terms of our\nnumber of steps involved therefore more\n\n85\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.920\nfocused on our ability to clearly define\nand move step to step or stage to stage.\n\n86\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.010\nWith what we're doing.\n\n87\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.940\nI would suggest that you make\nsure you are familiar with both.\n\n88\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.580\nCertainly the 14 point step methodology\nup above, full one if you will.\n\n89\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.870\nThe condensed one,\nthe nine steps down below.\n\n90\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.780\nBut again, notice, if required, let's go\nahead and maintain, and get that court\n\n91\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.260\napproval on that warrant that gives us\nthe legal validity to go out and search.\n\n92\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.740\nLet's go ahead and\nif necessary show up and testify and do so\n\n93\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.250\nfollowing the proper standards and\nprocedures and rules that guide us\n\n94\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.170\nin terms of being an expert witness and\nwe'll have some more to say about that.\n\n95\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.910\nIn upcoming conversations.\n\n96\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.720\nSo we do still see those there.\n\n97\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.830\nAnd notice that the last step is still\ntestify in court as an expert witness if\n\n98\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.630\nrequired.\n\n99\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.410\nBut notice that instead of prepare\na forensics report submit report to client\n\n100\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.390\nfor instance 12 and 13 up above,\nwe've simply truncated that\n\n101\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.640\ninto prepare report right here and\njust kind of collapsed those two down.\n\n102\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.370\nRight, so we're just simply streamlining,\nif you will,\n\n103\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.550\nwith regards to our methodology,\nnot leaving anything out.\n\n104\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.170\nJust collapsing those things that\nlogically roll up under a broader\n\n105\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.340\ncontainer to incorporate, and\ntherefore to encapsulate or\n\n106\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.260\nwrap, using some networking terminology,\nthat will become important to you as\n\n107\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.720\njust we go, and to incorporate, and\nto encapsulate that information.\n\n108\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.410\nSo, just think about that, right?\n\n109\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.460\nThe most important thing in methodologies,\nand this is something we stress a lot,\n\n110\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180\nin many of our conversation,\nis broad communication, broad awareness,\n\n111\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.610\nbroad application, standardization and\nadherence to the methodology\n\n112\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.880\nthrough all parties that were involved\nin getting into these activities.\n\n113\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.680\nTouching this evidence doing\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n114\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.810\nSo for example if an average user,\n\n115\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.490\nan end user in an organization in ABC\ncompany it doesn't matter who it is.\n\n116\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.780\nIf an average should be trained\non all of the steps involved.\n\n117\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.000\nCan we put our methodology\nsteps back up please?\n\n118\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.740\nWould they be involved, should they\nbe trained in all of those steps?\n\n119\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.400\nLet's say, even,\nlet's just be a little bit more specific.\n\n120\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760\nShouldn't we be training the average,\n\n121\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.770\neveryday user, average information worker\non step number three of our methodology?\n\n122\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.620\nCollection of evidence?\n\n123\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.940\nThat's something Information wise that\nwe'd want to share, and let Joe or\n\n124\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.260\nJohn from,\n&gt;&gt; HR or something.\n\n125\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.610\n&gt;&gt; Sales department or HR, whatever.\n\n126\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.310\nWe want to train them, invest the time and\n\n127\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.280\nenergy in having them understand how\nto collect evidence forensically?\n\n128\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.520\n&gt;&gt; No,\nbecause they're not an investigator,\n\n129\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.430\nthey're just an HR person or something.\n\n130\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.630\nAlthough it might seem like out of\nthe set that, yeah, they're there.\n\n131\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:58.390\nThey could handle that duty, but then\nif they're not, that's not their role.\n\n132\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.310\nAnd even though if you train them,\nit's a waste of time and money.\n\n133\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.350\nRight, because that's not what they do for\na living.\n\n134\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.590\nWe get someone who's trained to do that.\n\n135\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.540\nThat's what they do,\nthat's why we hire them or\n\n136\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.460\nhave them on staff, and\nlet them do that job.\n\n137\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.700\n&gt;&gt; So we want the experts essentially?\n\n138\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; People that are first and\n\n139\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.460\nforemost going to be doing\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n140\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.590\nJust like Joe or John, right,\nin HR or accounting or sales,\n\n141\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.245\nprobably don't want want Daniel or\nI doing their jobs.\n\n142\n00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:23.765\nLet's be honest.\n\n143\n00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:25.075\nYou want to get paid every two weeks?\n\n144\n00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:26.775\nYou don't want me handling payroll.\n\n145\n00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:29.415\nThat's just not gonna be a good\noutcome for anybody, right?\n\n146\n00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.055\nBecause that's just not my forte.\n\n147\n00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.065\nThat's not, as Daniel said,\nmy area of expertise.\n\n148\n00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.127\nSo we want wanna go with our strengths,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:36.127 --> 00:07:37.477\nWanna mitigate our weaknesses,\n\n150\n00:07:37.477 --> 00:07:42.267\nplay and uphold our strengths and\nreally make them a value add.\n\n151\n00:07:42.267 --> 00:07:45.627\nAnd that's not to say that these\npeople were talking about mythically\n\n152\n00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:46.397\ncouldn't be trained.\n\n153\n00:07:46.397 --> 00:07:48.417\nAs Daniel said,\nwe could invest and train them.\n\n154\n00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:51.500\nIt might not be the best use of\nour time or money or resources.\n\n155\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.269\nBut that doesn't mean that it wouldn't\nadd some value, but it's not a black and\n\n156\n00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:59.041\nwhite conversation, the reason I'm\nbracketing this conversation this way and\n\n157\n00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.658\nhaving us go through this is for\nthe following example.\n\n158\n00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:03.052\nSo I agree with you, by the way, right?\n\n159\n00:08:03.052 --> 00:08:04.652\nIn your supposition so far.\n\n160\n00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:07.950\nBut then you made a very,\nvery important point.\n\n161\n00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.560\nAlthough we kind of just\nblew right past it and\n\n162\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.380\nglossed over it as you were talking.\n\n163\n00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.560\nSo I want to go back to it.\n\n164\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.750\nBut you raise the fact that it's\nnot that they couldn't do it, and\n\n165\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.510\nin a pinch, their first\nresponders may be there on scene.\n\n166\n00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.640\nHey, wouldn't it be great if right, and so\nwe have to balance this because this is\n\n167\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.160\none of the kind of the funny little\nquirky things about first response and\n\n168\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.380\nabout forensics and\ninvestigative procedure.\n\n169\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.090\nIt's tempting to say let's make\nsure everybody that's on site\n\n170\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.430\nthat in any way shape or\nform may show up, may be involved,\n\n171\n00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.190\nmay just randomly be walking by and\nhave to deal with something.\n\n172\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.360\nHey let's train them because\nyou know what you never know.\n\n173\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.200\nThis is the first aid\nresponse methodology, right?\n\n174\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.960\nYou should get trained\nin first aid because\n\n175\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.620\nyou never know when you\nmight need that training.\n\n176\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.400\nIt's valuable, right?\n\n177\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.280\nCPR.\n\n178\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.400\nValuable skill.\n\n179\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.310\nYou could save somebody's life,\nas they say, right?\n\n180\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.950\nIt's a very important thing to have.\n\n181\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.770\nKnow how to save somebody\nif they're drowning, right?\n\n182\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.970\nBe able to get them to the edge of\nthe pool and get them out of the water.\n\n183\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.000\nThose are just standard skills,\nright, that we wanna have.\n\n184\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.780\nDo you have to know how to build a fire?\n\n185\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.520\nWell if you live in a area that's remote,\n\n186\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.380\nyou may wanna know that in\ncase you get stuck somewhere.\n\n187\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:11.950\nRight?\n\n188\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.980\nJust carry a lighter with you.\n\n189\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Firestick.\n\n190\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.590\nRight.\nSo these are skills that may actually\n\n191\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.170\nsave a life.\n\n192\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.200\nMay impact you and\nmaybe valuable to catalog.\n\n193\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.815\nAnd I'm not suggesting these skills\nare not on the same category.\n\n194\n00:09:22.815 --> 00:09:24.140\nI\"m just pointing out and\n\n195\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.920\nit's very tempting to say to\neverybody as a blanket statement.\n\n196\n00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.530\nHey let's make sure you\nunderstand how to do X Y Z,\n\n197\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.540\nbecause you may actually\nhave to do it at some point.\n\n198\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.690\nYeah but, and this is the thing\nwe've got to think about,\n\n199\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.370\nit's not about training people to\ncollect evidence, it's not about\n\n200\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.410\ntraining people to secure evidence, it's\nnot about training people to evaluate and\n\n201\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.090\nsecure the scene,\nthis is not what they do for a living.\n\n202\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.673\nWhat we have to train first responders to\ndo is they are not trained professionals\n\n203\n00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:55.514\nwho do this for a living is to ensure\nthat they do not mess anything up and\n\n204\n00:09:55.514 --> 00:09:59.805\ntrample in the scene in such a way\nthat they screw up evidence.\n\n205\n00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:04.703\nYou see this again in these movies and\ndramas somebody shows up finds a dead\n\n206\n00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:10.380\nbody probably on the ground and go over\nand check make sure somebody is not.\n\n207\n00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.270\nAlive and they do need help so\nyou gotta obviously interact,\n\n208\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.810\nokay there dead my God\nnow what I'm gonna do,\n\n209\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.510\nyou wanna just back away at that point\nright you wanna call obviously clear it,\n\n210\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.220\nget help make sure that authorities\nare alerted but what you don't wanna do is\n\n211\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.940\nbecome a colamboa and start investigating\nright because then you're gonna screw up.\n\n212\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.470\nPotentially many possibilities for\nlaw enforcement officials,\n\n213\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.540\nwho are trained to find these clues and\n\n214\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.050\nwho will understand how to read\nthem properly, to do their job.\n\n215\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.990\nAnd the most important thing we\ncan do as forensic investigators\n\n216\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.810\nis train those around us\nthat don't do this for\n\n217\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.660\na living, to understand limitations of\nwhat it is that they can and cannot do.\n\n218\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.690\nPeople want to be helpful,\npeople want to do the right thing.\n\n219\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.730\nWe should encourage that,\n\n220\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.890\nbut we have to put limitations on\nit is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n221\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.980\nThe point you made about while it may not\nbe a great investment of our time and\n\n222\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.220\nresources, the only thing I take\nexception with and not in a negative way.\n\n223\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I just want to clarify is,\n\n224\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.330\nyou know what, there is some value in\ninvesting a limited amount of time and\n\n225\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.010\nenergy to train everybody\nat a certain level.\n\n226\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.200\nBecause awareness and training is the\nsingle most important thing in security\n\n227\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.580\nthat we can do to raise the overall\ncapabilities of the organization to\n\n228\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.400\naddress threats, deal with risks, mitigate\nthem, and make us all more secure.\n\n229\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.940\nRight this is just a baseline assumption,\nthat we all have to internalize and\n\n230\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.200\nreally take out into the world and\npropagate everywhere we go\n\n231\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.020\nwith every action we undertake as we\nrepresent the security community over all.\n\n232\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.260\nIt's very important.\n\n233\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.960\nAnd to that end, we have to be smart.\n\n234\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.097\nWe have to be selective.\n\n235\n00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:43.026\nAnd we have to understand that the average\nindividual is gonna be capable of doing\n\n236\n00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:46.810\nsome very specific things that\nare uniquely helpful in many situations.\n\n237\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.620\nBut they're not experts and\nshouldn't be relied on to be so.\n\n238\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.270\nAnd so what we don't wanna do is\nwalk them through drive recovery.\n\n239\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.800\nWhat we wanna do is ensure that they\nunderstand that the rule should be,\n\n240\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.960\nlook don't touch.\n\n241\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.820\nAnd you should call when in question, and\nlet experts come and figure it out, right.\n\n242\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.630\nThe best thing you could do in other words\nis secure the scene by backing away and\n\n243\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.300\nmaking sure nobody walks in\nuntil the experts arrive.\n\n244\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.130\nIf we could train everybody to do that,\nwhat a different world we would live in.\n\n245\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Very much so.\n\n246\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.830\n&gt;&gt; I had this conversation,\nnot this conversation but\n\n247\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.340\na conversation similar with my younger\ndaughter last night all of things.\n\n248\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.540\nShe calls me up out of the blue you\nget one of those support calls.\n\n249\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.220\nYou get them, if you have kids,\n\n250\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.600\nif you are a kid you're\nprobably handling them, right?\n\n251\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.346\nAnd so she calls me up,\ndaddy the printer's not working,\n\n252\n00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:31.645\nI need to print something.\n\n253\n00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:36.247\nCan you tell me which printer I need\nbecause I'm not sure on my laptop\n\n254\n00:12:36.247 --> 00:12:39.370\nwhich one is the house printer.\n\n255\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.190\nSo I'm walking her through\nthis on the phone.\n\n256\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.290\nKeep in mind I'm obviously here in ITProTV\nstudios this week I'm not at home and\n\n257\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.580\nso I'm remote, right?\n\n258\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.080\nI'm hundreds of miles away and so\nI'm talking her through this on the phone,\n\n259\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.740\nand she's a very bright girl, and\ni said okay, well this is the printer and\n\n260\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.770\nshe went no,\nI figured out which the home printer is.\n\n261\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.480\nI got all that.\n\n262\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.280\nI already went and\nshe rattles off the list.\n\n263\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.750\nAlright, I did this and this and this and\nI know it's this, and I said okay, great,\n\n264\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.060\nso then why are you on the phone with me?\n\n265\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.497\nWell, it's still not working.\n\n266\n00:13:05.497 --> 00:13:07.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said, okay, so\n\n267\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.250\nlet's think about the obvious thing.\n\n268\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.610\nIs the printer turned on and\nsure enough she went no it's turned on.\n\n269\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.530\nAnd I said okay so there's two or\nthree other things.\n\n270\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.790\nThe missing ingredient in the equation is\nwe have a cleaning lady who comes in every\n\n271\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.480\nother week, very nice lady,\nshe does a great job but.\n\n272\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.700\nThe one thing I just have issue with every\ntime she comes is, she turns off all\n\n273\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.790\nthe switches in all the rooms as she's\ncleaning, or she rubs everything.\n\n274\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.690\nSo, she turns off the power to\nthe wireless infrastructure and cable,\n\n275\n00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.850\nand all that's turned off.\n\n276\n00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.340\nSo everything has to be turned back on,\n\n277\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.800\ntakes time to come back up and\nreset whenever she's there.\n\n278\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.170\nSo, she blew through town earlier\nin the week, so as a result,\n\n279\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.530\nI said to my little one, hey, did you\ncheck to make sure the switch It was on.\n\n280\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.490\nIt was on because maybe\nthe thing hasn't come back on.\n\n281\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.060\nAnd sure enough, that's what it was.\n\n282\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.020\nRight?\nSo, it's about understanding, right?\n\n283\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.350\nThe environment, the methodology,\nall those things.\n\n284\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.770\nShe's got a lot of knowledge.\n\n285\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.010\nShe can deal with it on-site\nhands-on cuz she does it every day.\n\n286\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.630\nShe knows how to fix those things.\n\n287\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.110\nBut an average person.\n\n288\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.310\nHey maybe they're not gonna\nunderstand all those things.\n\n289\n00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.470\nLet's train them on\nthe things they can do.\n\n290\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.420\nAnd let's play to their strengths and lets\nmake sure we don't over anticipate and\n\n291\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.010\nover assume on their behalf\nthey can do certain things.\n\n292\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.315\nIf I have same conversation with my mother\nit would be a very different story, right.\n\n293\n00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.835\nI mean just would not\nhave ended the same way.\n\n294\n00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:24.555\nAnd I love her just like I love my\ndaughter but supporting one of them is\n\n295\n00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:26.665\na lot more challenging then\nsupporting the other one, right.\n\n296\n00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:31.320\nSo the idea would be that with her\nit would be a little bit of a more\n\n297\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.020\nstep by step very, very slower pace\nconversation cuz you would have\n\n298\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.190\nanticipated all the things that she could\ndo to troubleshoot and figure it out.\n\n299\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.300\nShe would have been waiting for\n\n300\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.190\nme to help her walk through that cuz she's\njust not as familiar with the things that\n\n301\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.655\ngo on when you are trying to fix\na problem on a computer, right?\n\n302\n00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:47.995\nSo we have to understand\nthe limitations and\n\n303\n00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:51.475\nthe strengths of those that we work with,\nwork for, and that we support.\n\n304\n00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.245\nAnd as first responders,\na lot of the times,\n\n305\n00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:57.197\nfirst responders are people that\ndon't have technical training.\n\n306\n00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:57.827\nMore often than now.\n\n307\n00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:02.107\nI mean, if you think about the logic\nof the fact that you may get malware on\n\n308\n00:15:02.107 --> 00:15:03.357\na computer that you own.\n\n309\n00:15:03.357 --> 00:15:06.567\nAnd you may be able to deal with\nthat as an IT security professional,\n\n310\n00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:07.807\nwith your eyes closed, no big deal.\n\n311\n00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:10.147\nWe'll fix that right up and\nI know how to deal with that.\n\n312\n00:15:10.147 --> 00:15:12.637\nBut somebody else in\nthe organization gets it.\n\n313\n00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:14.227\nMaybe they're not familiar with it.\n\n314\n00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:17.117\nAnd that's the kind of thing we\nhave to not take for granted and\n\n315\n00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:18.177\nnot get frustrated by.\n\n316\n00:15:18.177 --> 00:15:20.810\nBut we have to understand how\nto use it to our advantage.\n\n317\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.110\nAnd also ensure that the most likely\nscenario are the ones that we talk\n\n318\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.750\nabout with people.\n\n319\n00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.760\nHey, if this does happen here's\nthe three things we need you to do.\n\n320\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.370\nSee something, say something.\n\n321\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.820\nGreat way of framing that for people.\n\n322\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.060\nSimple, easy, quick,\nconsumable, everybody gets it.\n\n323\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.100\nOne of the few things I think\nthe TSA has done really well, right.\n\n324\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.648\nAnd at the government in general,\nin this country, the United States,\n\n325\n00:15:43.648 --> 00:15:47.255\nhas done very well both here and\nas propagated, I think, around the world\n\n326\n00:15:47.255 --> 00:15:51.296\nto the airports that they interact with\nand provide security through and around.\n\n327\n00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:54.535\nGetting people educated about the fact\nthat if something looks unusual We should\n\n328\n00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:57.821\nbe saying something to the people that can\ninteract around that and figure it out,\n\n329\n00:15:57.821 --> 00:16:00.320\nand then we need to back away and\nlet them do their job, right?\n\n330\n00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.530\nIt's a very important thought process for\nus.\n\n331\n00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.510\nSo, making sure we know that and\ncommunicate that effectively,\n\n332\n00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.970\nvery important,\nis part of the investigative process.\n\n333\n00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.108\nBecause we're not gonna be\nable to be there at all times.\n\n334\n00:16:10.108 --> 00:16:13.782\nWe're not gonna have experts with eyes on\nthe ground at every point of contact and\n\n335\n00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:15.133\nevery point of inflection and\n\n336\n00:16:15.133 --> 00:16:18.591\nwe have to compensate for that by getting\npeople to help us do our job better,\n\n337\n00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:22.103\nby allowing us to find things that are\nthere after the fact because they don't\n\n338\n00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:25.217\ngo to the time and trouble of messing\nthem up and moving them around.\n\n339\n00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:25.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n340\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.420\nI needed to check my email\nwhile I was waiting.\n\n341\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.140\nSo, I went on Joe's computer,\nand I went ahead and\n\n342\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.310\ndid that while I was waiting on you.\n\n343\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.260\nThat wasn't bad, right.\n\n344\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.280\nI actually had,\nit's the exact conversation,\n\n345\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.920\nwith one of my customers at one point,\na couple of years ago.\n\n346\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.420\nThey called in,\nwe have a major problem and\n\n347\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.640\nwe gave them specific instructions,\nthis is what needs to happen, and show up,\n\n348\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.725\nand literally there's\nsomebody sitting at the desk.\n\n349\n00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:47.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You sit.\n\n350\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.460\nI'm like, what are you kidding?\n\n351\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.657\nThey're using the computer,\nthat they called us about.\n\n352\n00:16:51.657 --> 00:16:53.697\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, You say, well,\nnever mind, all right.\n\n353\n00:16:53.697 --> 00:16:55.357\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So did you solve the problem?\n\n354\n00:16:55.357 --> 00:16:56.064\nIs that why you do it?\n\n355\n00:16:56.064 --> 00:16:57.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n356\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.632\nSomething came up and we had to,\nI don't know whatever the excuse was.\n\n357\n00:17:00.632 --> 00:17:02.925\nAnd so weren't here, so we figured,\n\n358\n00:17:02.925 --> 00:17:06.019\nwell we'll just take care\nof it until you get here.\n\n359\n00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:08.249\nAnd at that point there\nwas nothing left to say.\n\n360\n00:17:08.249 --> 00:17:12.905\n&gt;&gt; What's with the night templar\nsay in the Indiana Jones movie?\n\n361\n00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:15.295\nYou have chosen poorly [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:16.515\n&gt;&gt; He chose poorly.\n\n363\n00:17:16.515 --> 00:17:17.425\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n364\n00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:20.115\n&gt;&gt; Great deadpan delivery,\nI love that line, that was great.\n\n365\n00:17:20.115 --> 00:17:22.085\nRight after the whole face-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the face melting, yes.\n\n366\n00:17:22.085 --> 00:17:23.355\n&gt;&gt; Great, great movie.\n\n367\n00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:25.318\n&gt;&gt; If you haven't seen that,\ngo watch that one.\n\n368\n00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:26.138\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very good, very good.\n\n369\n00:17:26.138 --> 00:17:27.850\n&gt;&gt; Indiana Jones and\nthe Last Crusade, amazing.\n\n370\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.440\n&gt;&gt; That's another good box to have.\n\n371\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.320\n&gt;&gt; It is, I've got it.\n\n372\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.430\nI've got it.\n&gt;&gt; Those are good.\n\n373\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.089\n&gt;&gt; It's a must have.\n\n374\n00:17:33.089 --> 00:17:36.524\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of those franchises\nwhere literally every one they did, I mean\n\n375\n00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:40.217\nlook they're all kind of quirky, right,\nbut every one they did was unique enough,\n\n376\n00:17:40.217 --> 00:17:43.703\neven though the concept was the same,\nthat there was something that you could to\n\n377\n00:17:43.703 --> 00:17:46.616\nlatch onto, right,\nit wasn't just like we did a fifth one and\n\n378\n00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:49.570\nit was really kinda stupid because\nwe didn't know what else to do.\n\n379\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.790\nIt was one of those one's that\nthey actually got it right enough,\n\n380\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.630\nthat every one of them has the ability\nto stand on its own, it's kind of good.\n\n381\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.390\n&gt;&gt; And I would say Raiders of\nthe Lost Arc is probably one of\n\n382\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.850\nthe best films ever made.\n\n383\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.370\nJust personal opinion.\n\n384\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.460\n&gt;&gt; I like it a lot,\n\n385\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.885\nI don't know that I would go with\nit being, I think it's in the list.\n\n386\n00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.453\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's in the list.\n\n387\n00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:09.450\n&gt;&gt; You didn't say the top one,\nso it's in there.\n\n388\n00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.070\nI think there are,\n\n389\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.115\nI'm more of an arts cinema,\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n\n390\n00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:14.430\n&gt;&gt; No, kinda from that\nperspective technicalities.\n\n391\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.080\n&gt;&gt; You're a Citizen Kane kinda person?\n\n392\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.835\n&gt;&gt; Citizen Kane was cool, I have this\nconversation with our buddy mister Taylor\n\n393\n00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:23.820\nout there about movies who has never, that\nhe's never seen [CROSSTALK] cuz he asked\n\n394\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.942\nme, hey what's your most favorite movie\nand I said well, probably Seven Samurai.\n\n395\n00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:29.225\nThat's a great quality.\n\n396\n00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:31.656\n&gt;&gt; And he looked it up and\nhe said, yeah I know that,\n\n397\n00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.072\nthat's actually [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Glaringly flick.\n\n398\n00:18:33.072 --> 00:18:33.880\n&gt;&gt; He thought that was good choice.\n\n399\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.040\nSo, l just think from\nthe text county perspective.\n\n400\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.700\n&gt;&gt; I agree with you on that one.\n&gt;&gt; That and dust boots.\n\n401\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.949\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've seen dust boots.\n\n402\n00:18:38.949 --> 00:18:39.711\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one too.\n\n403\n00:18:39.711 --> 00:18:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI still have that one on the list.\n\n404\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.818\nAnyway,\n&gt;&gt; So here we are,\n\n405\n00:18:42.818 --> 00:18:43.804\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:18:43.804 --> 00:18:45.322\n&gt;&gt; In the studio talking about\n\n407\n00:18:45.322 --> 00:18:51.088\ncinematographic wonders, and also can't\nforget Humphrey Boughat,specifically.\n\n408\n00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.529\n&gt;&gt; Casablanca here.\n\n409\n00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:54.965\n&gt;&gt; Specifically, Casablanca,\njust a classic, classic film.\n\n410\n00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:55.751\nAll right, so\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:56.860\n&gt;&gt; First responders, right?\n\n412\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.970\nSo who are they, what do they do?\n\n413\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.752\nWe have to identify where\nyour first responder,\n\n414\n00:19:00.752 --> 00:19:03.795\nwe're usually first ones on the scene,\nwe identify that something's happened,\n\n415\n00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:06.985\nwe're gonna make a phone call hopefully,\ntalk to people, get them to come in.\n\n416\n00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:08.285\nHopefully as we talk about help us but\n\n417\n00:19:08.285 --> 00:19:10.825\nyou know what,\nthey may not necessarily do that.\n\n418\n00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:13.025\nThey should as we said\nprotect the crime scene.\n\n419\n00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:16.387\nThey should act to ensure nothing is going\nto be tampered with, but beyond that,\n\n420\n00:19:16.387 --> 00:19:19.247\nif they're not trained,\nthat should be the extent of it.\n\n421\n00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:22.407\nIf they are trained, protecting and\npreserving temporary and\n\n422\n00:19:22.407 --> 00:19:26.807\nfragile or volatile evidence would\nbe on the list for first responders.\n\n423\n00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:28.527\nMaking sure that we have a complete and\n\n424\n00:19:28.527 --> 00:19:30.937\naccurate representation\nof the crime scene.\n\n425\n00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:32.137\nUnderstanding what's gone on,\n\n426\n00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:35.967\nphotographic as well as documentary\nevidence would be on that list.\n\n427\n00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:40.037\nPerhaps talking to and gathering up\nwitnesses that could then be interviewed\n\n428\n00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:43.630\nby law enforcement in a more\nthoughtful and more thorough way so\n\n429\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.670\nwe know who they are, and as a result can\ninteract with them, would be on that list.\n\n430\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.950\nSo first responders are gonna\ndo quite a bit of stuff.\n\n431\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.740\nThey may actually handle\nthe initial investigative process.\n\n432\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.600\nThey may be gathering evidence\nif they're trained to do so.\n\n433\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.320\nThey may be interacting with witnesses and\n\n434\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.580\ntaking detailed statements\nif they're trained to do so.\n\n435\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.770\nThere's a lot of skills in other words and\n\n436\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.430\ncapabilities that we could\npush onto first responders.\n\n437\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.370\nIt really depends on what kind\nof training we've given them and\n\n438\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.483\nwhat kind of role we've envisioned for\nthem in the organization.\n\n439\n00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:16.380\nThis goes back to that idea of language,\nright and how we define things.\n\n440\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.240\nA first responder, in a standard\ndefinition is who ever shows up and\n\n441\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.150\ndiscovers and therefore understands that\nsomething has gone on, but they may or\n\n442\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.460\nmay not be technically\nqualified to deal with that.\n\n443\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.840\nIn other organizations, first responders\nare incident handlers, they're just called\n\n444\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.130\nfirst responders because that's\nthe generic name we've given them, and\n\n445\n00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.820\nthey are highly trained individuals.\n\n446\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.030\nSo it really depends on the nature,\nthe context, or\n\n447\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.490\nthe culture around that environment.\n\n448\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.078\nCreating a first-responder toolkit,\nvery important,\n\n449\n00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.580\nwe've talked about the value\nof toolkits before.\n\n450\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.490\nMobile toolkits for deployment\ninto the field, things you need,\n\n451\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.360\nworkstations loaded with the appropriate\nsoftware, documentary, templates and\n\n452\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.530\ncapabilities that would be allowed for\nand created there.\n\n453\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.010\nSo you've got all your templates for\n\n454\n00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:05.200\nevidence gathering, evidence tracking,\nyour custody forms, things like that.\n\n455\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.350\nI'll show you some examples of those,\nwhat they look like, in a couple minutes.\n\n456\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.120\nMake sure you have the ability to be able\nto document everything you're doing.\n\n457\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.660\nMaking sure that in that tool kit\nwe have the ability to be able to\n\n458\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.360\ntake photographic evidence.\n\n459\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.950\nSo we can take pictures and do so, so\n\n460\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.580\nthat we can save and\nrepresent all the things going on.\n\n461\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.360\nGotta have gloves, believe it or\nnot, as crazy as that sounds,\n\n462\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.450\nyou don't go picking things\nup with your bare hands.\n\n463\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.760\nYou're gonna contaminate evidence,\nyou have to have gloves,\n\n464\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.408\nI see this in the movies all the time\nas well, they don't have the gloves,\n\n465\n00:21:34.408 --> 00:21:35.870\nthey have the,\n&gt;&gt; Latex gloves, yeah.\n\n466\n00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.434\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well whatever it is, but\nyou may find them, they have tweezers,\n\n467\n00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:40.336\nsometimes you just use a pencil or probe,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n468\n00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:41.380\nlike a probe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it is.\n\n469\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.037\nIt doesn't matter, you just gotta make\nsure you handle it with something that's\n\n470\n00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:48.630\ngonna be generic and not organic, so\nyou don't contaminate the evidence.\n\n471\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.730\nThat's the main thing.\n\n472\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.016\nOccasionally if they have gloves\nyou'll see them pick it up with,\n\n473\n00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.131\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n474\n00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:55.185\n&gt;&gt; Like a pinkie and they'll have\nthe glove pinkie so they can just handle\n\n475\n00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:58.552\nthe object but not contaminate a smudgy\nfingerprint, something like that,\n\n476\n00:21:58.552 --> 00:22:02.264\nit's really about ensuring that we're\nnot just modifying, marring the surface.\n\n477\n00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:06.310\nThe oils on our hands, the organic\nmaterials on our hands that we pick up\n\n478\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.130\nthrough, just average everyday\nmoving through the world.\n\n479\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.925\nYeah those we'll introduce things into\nthat piece of evidence that are not there\n\n480\n00:22:13.925 --> 00:22:16.915\nnormally, right, so we do have to think\nabout all of that and be aware of that.\n\n481\n00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:18.185\nEspecially if you've just had lunch.\n\n482\n00:22:18.185 --> 00:22:20.725\nLike barbecue or something that's\njust gonna get everywhere.\n\n483\n00:22:20.725 --> 00:22:23.230\nNot a good thing, right, so\nwanna make sure we don't do that.\n\n484\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.563\nI used to work with a guy, he used to love\nbarbecue, and I used to work with a guy\n\n485\n00:22:27.563 --> 00:22:32.036\nwho, he loved barbecue and so literally\nevery time he'd come back from lunch,\n\n486\n00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:36.745\nright,you'd just, there would be on\nthe server racks, everywhere [CROSSTALK].\n\n487\n00:22:36.745 --> 00:22:40.296\n&gt;&gt; The sweet Baby Rays is\na KC Masterpiece covering [CROSSTALK].\n\n488\n00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:42.080\n&gt;&gt; It would be one thing\nif it was dry run barbecue,\n\n489\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.380\nthis was like full bore, full on.\n\n490\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.336\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n491\n00:22:44.336 --> 00:22:47.176\n&gt;&gt; Let me go into the honey pot and\njust immerse myself in barbecue.\n\n492\n00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:48.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n493\n00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:50.750\nthere would just be\nbarbecue sauce everywhere.\n\n494\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.063\n&gt;&gt; But the place smelled amazing.\n\n495\n00:22:52.063 --> 00:22:52.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n496\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.680\nBut this was here, this was back in\nthe days where like we talked about in one\n\n497\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.520\nof the other episodes.\n\n498\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.758\nYou could smoke back in the day\nat a center and if someone,\n\n499\n00:22:58.758 --> 00:23:01.605\n[CROSSTALK] people would just walk in\nwith cups of coffee, with drinks and\n\n500\n00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:04.002\nyou'd see stuff everywhere\nlike nobody batted an eyelash.\n\n501\n00:23:04.002 --> 00:23:06.771\nYou wonder how we didn't manage\nto blow the world up back then,\n\n502\n00:23:06.771 --> 00:23:09.165\nI mean just all the crazy\nstuff we would do.\n\n503\n00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:12.105\nAnd so literally there would\njust be like junk everywhere.\n\n504\n00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:13.865\nAnd just, it's not like today.\n\n505\n00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.910\n&gt;&gt; We did lose atomic bombs back then.\n\n506\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.565\n&gt;&gt; Broken arrows, we did,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n507\n00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:18.825\n&gt;&gt; That was good movie.\n\n508\n00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a good movie\nright there, right, not as.\n\n509\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.733\nA little far fetched, a little hokey.\n\n510\n00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:24.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n511\n00:23:24.557 --> 00:23:25.890\nBut entertaining.\n\n512\n00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Face Off, remember that one?\n\n513\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.395\n&gt;&gt; Face Off, that's much better, yeah.\n\n514\n00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:29.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,can we swap faces?\n\n515\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.173\nAnd I'll go pretend to be you and\nyou go pretend to be me and go to jail and\n\n516\n00:23:32.173 --> 00:23:33.797\nsit there for\nawhile while I go to [CROSSTALK].\n\n517\n00:23:33.797 --> 00:23:37.820\nIn case you haven't seen those movies,\nalso good movies to consider.\n\n518\n00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.470\nThe whole John Travolta.\n\n519\n00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.577\n&gt;&gt; And Nic Cage.\n\n520\n00:23:40.577 --> 00:23:42.450\n&gt;&gt; Nic Cage collection going on there,\nright.\n\n521\n00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.290\nAll right.\n\n522\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.200\nSo crime scene processing and\nevidence collection tools.\n\n523\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.964\nVery important for us to consider.\n\n524\n00:23:47.964 --> 00:23:51.172\nRemember probably the best way to\nsum this up for first responders,\n\n525\n00:23:51.172 --> 00:23:53.999\nif we call it the first responder rule,\nDo no harm, right?\n\n526\n00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.242\nThat's the rule we wanna think about.\n\n527\n00:23:55.242 --> 00:23:56.323\nThat's what we wanna talk about.\n\n528\n00:23:56.323 --> 00:23:59.998\nWe have to impress on you, no matter\nhow hard it is for us to do that,\n\n529\n00:23:59.998 --> 00:24:04.350\nthat your primary objective is not to\nscrew anything up when you show up.\n\n530\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.730\nUnless you're trained to know how to\ndeal with it, leave it alone, right?\n\n531\n00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.180\nMy mother used to say,\n\n532\n00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.180\nif it doesn't belong to you,\nyou don't belong touching it, right?\n\n533\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n534\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.990\njust don't play with\nstuff if it's not yours.\n\n535\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.540\nThat's probably the easiest way to put it.\n\n536\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.290\nWhat would a trained first\nresponder be able to do?\n\n537\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.680\nThere's six traditional\nsteps that we would look at.\n\n538\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.120\nIf you want to take a look right here\nwith me, we can put those up for you.\n\n539\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.500\nSecure and evaluate the crime scene.\n\n540\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.460\nWe've talked about this and\nwhy this is important.\n\n541\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.280\nI mentioned conducting interviews.\n\n542\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.970\nDocumenting the crime scene.\n\n543\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.290\nCollecting and preserving evidence.\n\n544\n00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.860\nPackaging and transporting.\n\n545\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.480\nNow, let's talk about documenting\nthe crime scene here for\n\n546\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.660\njust a minute, number 3.\n\n547\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.670\nSo when I say, documented the crime scene,\ngood sir, what comes up in your mind?\n\n548\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.300\nWhat do we think?\n\n549\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.040\n&gt;&gt; A few different things.\n\n550\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.320\nPhotographing the crime scene.\n\n551\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.111\n&gt;&gt; Photographing.\n\n552\n00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:48.578\n&gt;&gt; Maybe sketching the crime scene.\n\n553\n00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:50.280\nMaybe taking detail-\n&gt;&gt; The artist in you coming out.\n\n554\n00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the artist in me coming out.\n\n555\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.120\nMaybe taking detailed notes.\n\n556\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.750\nThe brown shoes were next to the jeans,\non the floor by the bed.\n\n557\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.830\nJust giving a descriptive idea of what was\nat the crime scene, that kind of thing.\n\n558\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.230\n&gt;&gt; So I mean all those things,\nall of them would be good.\n\n559\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.530\nBecause one and number one have multiple\noverlapping reference points, right?\n\n560\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.550\n&gt;&gt; So we definitely wanna have\nthe photographic evidence.\n\n561\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.440\nIt's very hard to argue with that\nfact that when we took the picture\n\n562\n00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.540\nthat that's what was there.\n\n563\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.980\nAnd it's obviously legitimately in\nthat place on this particular photo.\n\n564\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.330\nI'm not saying photos can't be retouched,\nmodified, we all understand they can be.\n\n565\n00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.470\nBut I'm just pointing out that when\ndone from an investigators prospective,\n\n566\n00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.910\nwhen the appropriate rules and\nstandards in place,\n\n567\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.450\nwe take that as being primary evidence so\nwe take that to the authoritative because\n\n568\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.710\nwe assume they're not gonna be Photoshop\noften retouch things like that.\n\n569\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.620\nSo yeah,\nphotographic evidence very important.\n\n570\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.770\nYears ago, we used to do video.\n\n571\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly now we do photos.\n\n572\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.660\nWe do both.\nWe talked about the whole 3D circle in\n\n573\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.900\nthe round or theater in the round\nkinda thing that goes on today.\n\n574\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.830\nSo that's obviously gonna be important.\n\n575\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.870\nIn addition, yeah you made\nanother great observation there,\n\n576\n00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.440\ngonna take detailed copy of these notes,\nso we're not just gonna rely on photos,\n\n577\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.020\nwe're gonna talk about and\nwrite down the things that are there.\n\n578\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.670\nA lot of times you'll see people\nwalking around with tape recorders or\n\n579\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.850\nthe modern day equivalent.\n\n580\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.150\nWhatever you're using to capture audio.\n\n581\n00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.940\nBut they are walking through and\ndescribing as well,\n\n582\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.340\nnot just sketching and doing that.\n\n583\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.520\nSketching may happen.\n\n584\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.530\nYou don't tend to see sketching as often\njust because it takes time as I'm sure\n\n585\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.490\nyou're well aware.\n\n586\n00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.290\nAnd you have to have somebody who's\nactually trained right as an artist to be\n\n587\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:24.180\nable to do that, little see Joe run, see\nJack and Spot jump over the tree kinda.\n\n588\n00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.320\nStick figure sketches\njust don't cut it right?\n\n589\n00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.151\nWell you can see clearly\nthere's a table there right?\n\n590\n00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:28.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n591\n00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:30.730\nwe really can't we just\nsee a bunch of lines.\n\n592\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.320\nRight.\nSo\n\n593\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.450\nhaving an artist on hand, who may be able\nto legitimately really sketch out a room.\n\n594\n00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.620\nIf you have that, that's great.\n\n595\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.380\nAnd you'll keep in mind, law enforcement\nagencies probably have these resources,\n\n596\n00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.860\nright, they'll have these people, and they\nmay be able to call a sketch artist in.\n\n597\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.240\nAnd have them do a sketch.\n\n598\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.190\nBut a forensic investigator may or\nmay not have that capability and\n\n599\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.360\nthey just may not know how to do that.\n\n600\n00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.600\nSo that may not be the primary go-to but\nit is an interesting one.\n\n601\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.610\nIt certainly could be\nsomething we would do.\n\n602\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.200\nSo it's just something to consider and\nto be award of.\n\n603\n00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.350\nBut we definitely want to have\nthose kind of thoughts in our mind,\n\n604\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.450\nwant to make sure that\nwe can do those things.\n\n605\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.070\nA lot of times we will not just\ntake the pictures, do all that.\n\n606\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:15.200\nBut we also have to ensure, going back\nup to step number one, right here.\n\n607\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.920\nWe have to ensure that nothing is\nmoved until all the documentation\n\n608\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.360\nhas been noted.\n\n609\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.110\nAnd in other words,\nyou'll notice here in step four.\n\n610\n00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.968\nThis is where we start to actually pick\nthings up off the ground and we start\n\n611\n00:27:26.968 --> 00:27:30.765\nto actually put them into bags and\nwe start to remove them from the initial\n\n612\n00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:35.122\nplace we found them, and place them into\nsecure carrying and storage containers so\n\n613\n00:27:35.122 --> 00:27:39.020\nwe can then remove them from the scene and\nultimately analyze them.\n\n614\n00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.870\nIt's not until after we have secured, not\nuntil after we have documented, not until\n\n615\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.780\nwe have talked to the people that may have\nobserved things, that we actually do that.\n\n616\n00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.570\nAnd it's really important to stress that\nbecause if we start by going around and\n\n617\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:56.690\npicking everything up and examining it so\nthat we can turn it over and\n\n618\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.870\nexamine it and sketch it and do all that,\nwe've just screwed up, right?\n\n619\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.705\nBecause we no longer have a point of\nreference for where things were and\n\n620\n00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:07.290\nas a result of the orientation of\nthe in relation to other things.\n\n621\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.970\nOne of the biggest mistakes you see\npeople make, in this area in particular,\n\n622\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.704\nis that they'll come along and I know\nwith the overhead camera, we probably,\n\n623\n00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:18.042\nI don't know if we could really see it,\nand I don't know if we could and\n\n624\n00:28:18.042 --> 00:28:21.529\nwe didn't really set it up, so\nit's probably not a good idea to do that.\n\n625\n00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:25.408\nWhat I was going to say is if we could\nshow a shot of the edge of my laptop\n\n626\n00:28:25.408 --> 00:28:26.100\nover here.\n\n627\n00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.589\nThere's four cables coming out of the side\nof it, right you can kinda see them,\n\n628\n00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:31.860\nyou can't really tell,\nbut you can kinda see.\n\n629\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.170\nBut you can see all the ridiculousness\nthat's going on back here right,\n\n630\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.055\njust over here all these cables and what\ncolors they are and stuff like that and.\n\n631\n00:28:39.055 --> 00:28:40.065\nYour have it laying on the table.\n\n632\n00:28:40.065 --> 00:28:42.075\nOne of the things we'd have to do.\n\n633\n00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:44.865\nIf we were forensically\nexamining this scene for\n\n634\n00:28:44.865 --> 00:28:48.735\nevidence would be that we would\nhave to capture the position.\n\n635\n00:28:48.735 --> 00:28:49.515\nThere we go.\nLook at that.\n\n636\n00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:50.378\nThe position.\n\n637\n00:28:50.378 --> 00:28:51.156\nYou've got to be careful for\nwhat you wish for-\n\n638\n00:28:51.156 --> 00:28:51.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n639\n00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:52.425\n&gt;&gt; Around here right.\n\n640\n00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.005\nI wish I had a cup of coffee.\n\n641\n00:28:54.005 --> 00:28:55.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And a banana.\n\n642\n00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:56.035\nYeah, who knows what would happen?\n\n643\n00:28:56.035 --> 00:28:56.543\n&gt;&gt; Ding!\n\n644\n00:28:56.543 --> 00:28:57.495\n&gt;&gt; Ding right?\n[LAUGH] So\n\n645\n00:28:57.495 --> 00:29:01.770\nwhat you would see is that literally\nas you can see kernel point to them.\n\n646\n00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.510\nAnd we're zooming,\nthank you very much sir, appreciate that.\n\n647\n00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:09.390\nSo we can see here, this cable right here\nis joined to, I know you can't see it,\n\n648\n00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.270\nI'll just bring it over to the side,\nis joined to my mouse.\n\n649\n00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.429\nThat's the mouse cable, right.\n\n650\n00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:14.880\nAnd it's wrapped around\nthe outer side of the machine.\n\n651\n00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.430\nThis one right here is my\nnetwork cable you can see,\n\n652\n00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.220\nthis is a network cable plugged in.\n\n653\n00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.333\nThis is the video that we're\nactually using to display and\n\n654\n00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:23.740\nthis is power connector.\n\n655\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.625\nNotice that this, the light is\ngreen on the connector indicating,\n\n656\n00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:29.000\nit's plugged in for\ninstance, drawing power.\n\n657\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.910\nThat exact order, that sequence of cables\nin that particular order connected this\n\n658\n00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.710\nway and the identifier let's say for\nthis network cable right here.\n\n659\n00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.940\nIt's got a little piece of tape\non it right here that may or\n\n660\n00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.560\nmay not indicate something hard to say.\n\n661\n00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.800\nDoesn't indicate anything in our case.\n\n662\n00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.160\nBut maybe it's tagged with a circuit ID or\na port ID who knows what it is.\n\n663\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.960\nWe have two network connections on\nthe here so maybe this is number one.\n\n664\n00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.440\nDaniel's usually number two\ndepending on where we are.\n\n665\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.870\nSo those kinda things are gonna be\nimportant because unless we document that\n\n666\n00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.750\nexact state and everything on the machine\nincluding the pieces of paper sitting\n\n667\n00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.010\nhere with just my little cheat sheet\nnotes on the IP addresses for machines.\n\n668\n00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.610\nI have to remote into to do demos,\nthings like that.\n\n669\n00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.840\nIf we don't have all of this here,\nand then we come along and\n\n670\n00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.925\nsay, okay, yeah,\nwe know exactly what happened happens.\n\n671\n00:30:16.925 --> 00:30:20.005\nSuch and such occurred and\nwe don't have the way to prove that.\n\n672\n00:30:20.005 --> 00:30:22.165\nWe can't tell for\nsure what was plugged in where.\n\n673\n00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:23.855\nWe can't use any of that information.\n\n674\n00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.075\nIt's just not going to be presentable.\n\n675\n00:30:25.075 --> 00:30:30.025\n&gt;&gt; And an interesting detail, you think,\nokay we had the cable, the network cable,\n\n676\n00:30:30.025 --> 00:30:32.155\nthe video split cable and the power cable.\n\n677\n00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:35.495\nAnd you notice that the power light\nis green, it's drawing power.\n\n678\n00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:40.230\nThe green light lets you know that the\npower on the battery is full if its amber,\n\n679\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.010\nit is charging.\n\n680\n00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.360\nSo we would wanna mark that detail,\nwas it green or\n\n681\n00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.160\nwas it amber because\nthat might be different.\n\n682\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.700\nThere might something come\nabout that detail has changed\n\n683\n00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.390\nin someones report versus your report.\n\n684\n00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.080\nNow, why is there an inconsistency?\n\n685\n00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.050\nJust little details like\nthat can be very important.\n\n686\n00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n687\n00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.450\nWe have the state of\nthe network connection.\n\n688\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.580\nWe didn't show you\nthe actual screen right but\n\n689\n00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.030\nwe obviously have a network connection,\nyou've seen me use the machine.\n\n690\n00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.400\nWe're connected out and in a box etc,\nobviously on a physical wired connection,\n\n691\n00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.030\nI'm not using wireless right now.\n\n692\n00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.600\nThose kind of things also\nequally important right.\n\n693\n00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.730\nSo we have to know that, who's logged onto\nthe box under what account, all that kinds\n\n694\n00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:21.410\nof stuff has to be documented before we do\nanything, or something about who is logged\n\n695\n00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.560\non is probably not documented\nbefore we start investigating.\n\n696\n00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.580\nBut the state of all the cables,\n\n697\n00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.650\nperipherals, printers all that kind of\nstuff that may be plugged in locally,\n\n698\n00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.235\neverything is going to\nhave to be documented.\n\n699\n00:31:32.235 --> 00:31:35.355\nVery very important to understand all\nthose things, we often miss that.\n\n700\n00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:38.795\nPeople come along and you start doing\ntheir stuff and they'll pick the box up\n\n701\n00:31:38.795 --> 00:31:42.065\nand move it around like I just did with\nthe screen right to lower it and not that\n\n702\n00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:45.402\nthe position of the screen necessarily\nis the most critical element, right?\n\n703\n00:31:45.402 --> 00:31:46.652\nI didn't actually move the box,\n\n704\n00:31:46.652 --> 00:31:48.582\nI just moved the screen to\nlet you see the cables.\n\n705\n00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:52.353\nBut if I started unhooking cables without\ndocumenting how they were hooked up,\n\n706\n00:31:52.353 --> 00:31:54.337\nthat would actually be a really big deal.\n\n707\n00:31:54.337 --> 00:31:57.140\nSo we want to be answering and asking.\n\n708\n00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.525\nStandard set of questions\nhere the five W's and the H.\n\n709\n00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:00.686\nWho, what, when, where, why and how?\n\n710\n00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.240\nThose are our friends, right?\n\n711\n00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.070\nWe've learned about those for sometime.\n\n712\n00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.240\nThose are questions we are taught probably\nwhen we are very young in most cases and\n\n713\n00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.140\nwe hope we have a sense of\nthe value of those questions.\n\n714\n00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.656\nFrom your perspective you were planning on\ntaking the exam and getting ready for it.\n\n715\n00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:15.821\nKeep in mind and please just equate, and\n\n716\n00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:19.957\nwe've talked about this in other shows\nin other areas, equate the concept of\n\n717\n00:32:19.957 --> 00:32:24.620\nthe question why specifically when we ask\nthe question why equate that root cause.\n\n718\n00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.170\nWe're looking for root cause when we\nanswer, if we do it the right way, ask and\n\n719\n00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.060\nanswer the question why.\n\n720\n00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.310\nAnd we are trying to\nestablish what root cause is?\n\n721\n00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.430\nAnd that's a very important linkage for\nyou, regards to the exams.\n\n722\n00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.500\nSo, just please make sure you're aware\nof that; that you have that in your mind\n\n723\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.540\nas we're talking about\nsome of these themes.\n\n724\n00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.990\nAnd, also, the idea that we have\nto have a consent to search.\n\n725\n00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.180\nWe're gonna come back to this idea\nin some upcoming conversations, but\n\n726\n00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.500\nwe have to have permission.\n\n727\n00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.200\nWitnesses of that are standing around\nthat may have seen something, may or\n\n728\n00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.330\nmay not be able to give us permission if\nthey do not have the right to say yeah\n\n729\n00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:01.020\nthat's my laptop I give you the right to\ngo search, I'm the owner of the building,\n\n730\n00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.430\nyou can go look around.\n\n731\n00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.080\nI saw something great Mr Jones,\nyou saw something, do you work here?\n\n732\n00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.900\nNo, I was just here dropping off\npackage and I saw something happen.\n\n733\n00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.550\nThat's not the person you want\nto get consent to search from.\n\n734\n00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.750\nCuz they have no legal standing,\nno ability, no right to give you that.\n\n735\n00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.860\nYou have to be clear, as an investigator,\n\n736\n00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.430\nthat you were given the right to go\nin under and tape those activities,\n\n737\n00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.575\nby somebody in a position to do so,\notherwise you're trespassing.\n\n738\n00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:27.436\nEssentially, you've broken the law,\n\n739\n00:33:27.436 --> 00:33:30.896\nanything you find as a result of that\nsearch will never see the light of day.\n\n740\n00:33:30.896 --> 00:33:34.866\nIt will never go into a court of law\nbecause it's inadmissible evidence,\n\n741\n00:33:34.866 --> 00:33:38.580\nbecause you searched for it and\nuncovered it without the right to do so\n\n742\n00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.564\nbased on the owner of that system, or\n\n743\n00:33:40.564 --> 00:33:44.950\nthe legal representative who could give\nyou that right being able to do so.\n\n744\n00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.170\nWe'll go through this logic in more\ndetail in some upcoming conversations,\n\n745\n00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.920\nwalk you through the dos and don'ts of\nwhen I do need consent, when I don't need\n\n746\n00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.350\nconsent, if there's exigent circumstances\nas we talked about in prior episodes.\n\n747\n00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:01.530\nWe fear that somebody may about\nto be Immediately harm or\n\n748\n00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.080\nevidence may be immediately\ndestroyed by somebody's actions,\n\n749\n00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.160\nwe may be able to bypass\ncertain process steps and\n\n750\n00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.890\nprocedures in favor of acting to save\na life or saving information but\n\n751\n00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.990\nonly under very strictly controlled\nIt's tightly defined circumstances.\n\n752\n00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.540\nSo the normal rule of thumb is,\n\n753\n00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.570\nyou gotta have permission before you\ntouch anything and the permission has to\n\n754\n00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:23.070\ncome from a representative that\ncan give you that authority.\n\n755\n00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:27.020\nThe owner or a delegated represented of\nthem with regards typically to property.\n\n756\n00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.400\nSo, you hypothetically, just give\nyou a quick example as we wrap up.\n\n757\n00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.880\nChew on this problem, if you will.\n\n758\n00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.730\nSo if you're in a home as in investigator,\n\n759\n00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.630\ndo you have the right to go\nsearch any room in that home?\n\n760\n00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.690\nWith or\nwithout the consent of the homes owner.\n\n761\n00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.440\nThe answer is no normally you have to have\nthe ownership right so the person who owns\n\n762\n00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.910\nthe home has to say to you yeah I\ngive you the right to go search.\n\n763\n00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.342\nBut what if somebody subleases\na room within the home?\n\n764\n00:34:50.342 --> 00:34:50.875\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n765\n00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:55.445\n&gt;&gt; In other words, as the landlord, can\nyou give somebody legal representative for\n\n766\n00:34:55.445 --> 00:34:57.935\nthe authority to search\nsomeone else's room\n\n767\n00:34:57.935 --> 00:34:59.895\nif they're leasing it from you, right?\n\n768\n00:34:59.895 --> 00:35:03.897\nDo you have that right or\ndo you have to get the right to search.\n\n769\n00:35:03.897 --> 00:35:08.097\nA permission from the person who's\nactually the quote on quote, owner, right,\n\n770\n00:35:08.097 --> 00:35:09.817\nthe person who's leasing that room.\n\n771\n00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:11.627\nIt's a thorny subject sometimes, and\n\n772\n00:35:11.627 --> 00:35:13.977\nwe have to think through\nthe logic of those things.\n\n773\n00:35:13.977 --> 00:35:17.240\nNot so much in a home, but more so\nin an office space, right.\n\n774\n00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.340\nYou have a office building with\nmultiple floors and multiple tenants.\n\n775\n00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.290\nCan the building owner or management\ncompany give you the right to go into\n\n776\n00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.170\nanybody else's area or do you have to get\nrights from the people that have leased\n\n777\n00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.460\nthat particular set of suites or floors in\norder to legally search their premises?\n\n778\n00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.340\nAgain, this is a you'll have really\nthorny topics sometimes depending on\n\n779\n00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.240\nwhat you're doing.\n\n780\n00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.140\nAnd depending on circumstances the\nbuilding ownership, or management company,\n\n781\n00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.990\nmay be able to allow you in, and\ngive you access, can open the door.\n\n782\n00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.360\nHey we think there's a fire,\ngot to get in there, right.\n\n783\n00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.470\nNobody's around,\nit's after hours, late at night.\n\n784\n00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.640\nThey collect the fire department,\n\n785\n00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.230\nthey collect the police,\nthey have the right to do that.\n\n786\n00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.690\nBut without a search warrant they don't\nhave the ability to open that door and\n\n787\n00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.190\nsay to you go in,\nwe are just gonna give you permission.\n\n788\n00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.460\nThere has to be a search warrant in\na legal requirement and reason for\n\n789\n00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.920\nyou to show up and demand an access and\nso you got to follow the rules and\n\n790\n00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.910\nmake sure you understand those.\n\n791\n00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:05.690\n&gt;&gt; That would be-\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n792\n00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.050\n&gt;&gt; That is very interesting topic,\nthe plot, the thicken, right, so\n\n793\n00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.080\nit's not just-\n&gt;&gt; It's also on the stove.\n\n794\n00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.470\nIf you don't pay attention to that.\n\n795\n00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.630\n&gt;&gt; You never know what contingencies,\nor actions in circumstance might\n\n796\n00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.490\nallow you to be able to search,\nor might not be able to search.\n\n797\n00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:25.380\nIt was made me think of, what if the\nperson has set up a home office, right?\n\n798\n00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:31.200\nIt's in their home, but\nthe office is furnished by the company.\n\n799\n00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.704\n&gt;&gt; And you all-\n&gt;&gt; You have rights to that.\n\n800\n00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:37.286\nDoes that become part of\nthe crime property of the company.\n\n801\n00:36:37.286 --> 00:36:41.712\n&gt;&gt; And so very interesting ideas and\nthings that we have to go over.\n\n802\n00:36:41.712 --> 00:36:46.560\nSo just start keeping that question in\nthe back of your mind as we proceed to\n\n803\n00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.228\ntalk about other things in this series.\n\n804\n00:36:49.228 --> 00:36:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Went through some great stuff.\n\n805\n00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.780\nObviously our right to search our\nmethodology of investigation.\n\n806\n00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.560\nThat's things you need to keep on the tip\nof your tongue, be ready for at any time.\n\n807\n00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.050\nAs well as what is a first responder.\n\n808\n00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.520\nWhat do they do, how's that look?\n\n809\n00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.170\nVery good information this episode.\n\n810\n00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.180\nBut we have more, we are coming back.\n\n811\n00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.010\nYou just thought it was safe\nto turn back on, no, no,\n\n812\n00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.610\nwe've got plenty more to come\nwith this part of the series.\n\n813\n00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.380\nSo join us back,\nwe'll have another part for that.\n\n814\n00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.269\n&gt;&gt; I got goosebumps when you said that.\n\n815\n00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:15.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exciting.\n\n816\n00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.450\n&gt;&gt; I know, our time is up for this one\nthough, we do thank you guys for watching.\n\n817\n00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.507\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT ProTV,\n\n818\n00:37:20.507 --> 00:37:22.960\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n819\n00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.555\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n820\n00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:30.556\n[MUSIC]\n\n821\n00:37:30.556 -->

00:00:12.044\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.610\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.276\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, well, yeah, that's right.\n\n7\n00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.640\nIt's more CHFI version 9,\ncuz that's what you came to see.\n\n8\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Shocking, absolutely shocking.\n\n9\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.342\n&gt;&gt; Blows your mind doesn't it,\nthat we do the same show until it's done.\n\n10\n00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:30.536\nSo that's where we're at, and\ntoday joining me in the studio yet again,\n\n11\n00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:32.380\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.330\nAdam glad to have you again,\nhow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.160\n&gt;&gt; It is going this way, cuz we did this,\nand now we are doing this.\n\n14\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.242\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're on part five.\n\n15\n00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:40.360\n&gt;&gt; We're on part five,\n\n16\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.125\nI'm gonna run out of fingers pretty\nsoon if we don't get this topic covered.\n\n17\n00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.160\n&gt;&gt; You are [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's keep going,\n\n18\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.380\nwe're gonna jump back in.\n\n19\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.780\nWe are gonna jump in and continue\ntalking about the investigative process.\n\n20\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.376\nI wanna talk about order volatility for\nevidence gathering, specifically.\n\n21\n00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.827\nA very important part of what\nwe deal with when we think about\n\n22\n00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.350\nthe investigative process.\n\n23\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.980\nRemember we have different\nkinds of evidence or data,\n\n24\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.890\nyou can think of it either way.\n\n25\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.400\nBut order of volatility,\n\n26\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.170\nwe think of certainly data that is\ngoing to be dynamic or volatile.\n\n27\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.850\nData that is static or\nusually not gonna be volatile,\n\n28\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.840\nwill not be removed during power off.\n\n29\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.083\nAnd then, of course, we have remnant data\nthat sits behind in the systems despite\n\n30\n00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.828\nour best efforts, perhaps, to remove it.\n\n31\n00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:22.663\nAnd so we have to think about the fact,\nthere certain areas in our systems that\n\n32\n00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:26.793\nhave data that is volatile, that will be\ndisrupted and removed if we power down, or\n\n33\n00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:29.410\nmodify system settings or\nthings like that.\n\n34\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.330\nOther data may be fixed and\nstatic and will not be moved.\n\n35\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.660\nAnd I demonstrated this early on in one\nof our conversations where I pulled up\n\n36\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.670\na command line.\n\n37\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.260\nI showed you that we have netstat,\nand nbtstat, and ipconfig, displaydns.\n\n38\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.690\nThat's three examples of tools or\ncache registers,\n\n39\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.810\nmemory spaces things of that nature\nthat will contain certain kinds of data,\n\n40\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.150\nsome of it volatile and some of it not.\n\n41\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.394\nI looked at the route command,\nwe looked at route print, and\n\n42\n00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.433\nshowed you that there are static routes\nin the routing table that are maintained.\n\n43\n00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.580\nBut there are may also be dynamic routes\nthat are added that can be modified.\n\n44\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.040\nSo there's lots of this\ndifferent kind of information.\n\n45\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.720\nIf you join me over here and take a look,\nI just wanna run through quickly with you\n\n46\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.090\nthe order of volatility from most volatile\nto least volatile you will see here.\n\n47\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.830\nRegisters in cache, or cache,\ndepending on where you come from and\n\n48\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.760\nhow you choose to pronounce that.\n\n49\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.680\nThat will be the area where\nwe see the most volatile data\n\n50\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.190\nexhibiting itself in a system.\n\n51\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.460\nSo again, if we were to do something,\nnot like that, but rather like this.\n\n52\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.600\nAnd we were to go in, and\nwe were to take a look at netstat\n\n53\n00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:39.390\nTake a look at our adapter, we would see\nvolatile data that is being registered for\n\n54\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.840\nopen connections, and\nport numbers and IP addresses.\n\n55\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.290\nThat would disappear were we\nto power down the system or\n\n56\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.620\nmodify the IP information,\nmodify the interface information.\n\n57\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.470\nWe would modify that table,\nthat would be considered volatile data.\n\n58\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.680\nThat is going to potentially be something\nthat we have to worry about and\n\n59\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.240\nthink about capturing.\n\n60\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.160\nSo that's important to consider, right?\n\n61\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.480\nBecause, when we are caching data,\nwe are looking a data that is in memory.,\n\n62\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.580\nand in an area were we have to access it\nand have the ability to work with it.\n\n63\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.090\nBecause it may be modified or\ndisappear by a system process, and,\n\n64\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.950\nor some other function, so\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n65\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.640\nRouting tables, process tables, memory,\nlocations of information in memory,\n\n66\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.120\nthe data contained there,\nalso considered highly volatile.\n\n67\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.060\nTemporary file systems and\n\n68\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.240\ntemporary file storage within\nthose file systems are important.\n\n69\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.300\nSo when we mount the USB drive,\nwe create a temporary file system\n\n70\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.700\npointer that tells use how to access\nthe content on the USB device.\n\n71\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.210\nAnd that information is ephemeral,\nit's there only for\n\n72\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.130\nthe period of time that the device is\nactually in the system and then removed.\n\n73\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.720\nSo we have to think about that and,\nobviously, be aware of that.\n\n74\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.010\nThere may be metadata that's\nassociated with that as well,\n\n75\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.220\nwe have to consider that.\n\n76\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.170\nSo disk or\nstorage media that is being used.\n\n77\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.280\nWe have remote logging, and monitoring\ndata, configurations, topologies and,\n\n78\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.220\nultimately, archival media.\n\n79\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.900\nAll of these things are going to be\nimportant for us, and important in order.\n\n80\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.390\nAnd we wanna make sure\nwe are aware of them.\n\n81\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.070\nAnd so this would be one of those\ntables that I would definitely suggest.\n\n82\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.360\nYou would wanna commit to memory if\nyou're planning on taking the exam.\n\n83\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.110\nI wanna make sure you know from most\nvolatile step number 1, or item number 1,\n\n84\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.070\ndown to least volatile, item number 7.\n\n85\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.496\nWanna understand the logic of that, right?\n\n86\n00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:29.975\nAnd remember it may not show up and\nbe as obvious as, hey number 4 is disk or\n\n87\n00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:31.010\nstorage media.\n\n88\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.760\nThey may say instead,\nof all the items on this list,\n\n89\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.840\nwhich one would be or\nwhat order would you put them in?\n\n90\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.490\nIt may not be those words,\nit may be system representations of that.\n\n91\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.570\nSo instead of disk or storage media, they\nmay say DVD, or CD-ROM or floppy disk.\n\n92\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.884\nProbably don't know,\nhaven't seen those very often, right?\n\n93\n00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:51.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's been a while.\n\n94\n00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.480\n&gt;&gt; But just keep in mind, or SD card or\nsomething like that, whatever it is.\n\n95\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.300\nBut keep in mind,\nthat is a type of disk or storage media.\n\n96\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.400\nAnd that would fall into that number\n4 category, number 4 item, but\n\n97\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.530\nit would be a specific example.\n\n98\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.280\nAnd so you have to be able to apply the\ninformation is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n99\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.980\nJust so you're aware of that,\nand just so you know.\n\n100\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.633\nWe're gonna talk about evidence collection\nand methodologies here in a minute.\n\n101\n00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:17.000\nSo we'll come back to that and take a look\nat that, but just be aware of the logic.\n\n102\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.988\nWe have to also think about the fact that\nwe may have an impact from malware in\n\n103\n00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:25.501\nthe system, with regards to malware\nbeing present as we go to capture.\n\n104\n00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:28.930\nAnd as we go to gather evidence\nfrom most to least volatile.\n\n105\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.200\nWe were just talking about malware,\nbefore we came back on, and\n\n106\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.300\nsome of the things associated with it.\n\n107\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.280\nAnd it's important for\n\n108\n00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.000\nus to understand that malware will\nexist in multiple places in the system.\n\n109\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.513\nAnd maybe in some of\nthe more volatile areas and\n\n110\n00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:44.676\nsome less volatile areas if\nit's resident in the system.\n\n111\n00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:48.930\nAnd has been able to burrow its way\nin through manipulation of software.\n\n112\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.870\nLet's say through the delivery of\na payload that's allowed us to establish\n\n113\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.250\ncontrol over that machine and\nkeep it infected long-term.\n\n114\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.710\nAnd so this can present itself as\na challenge across multiple layers.\n\n115\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.140\nWithin the order of volatility\nfrom a malware perspective and\n\n116\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.470\nfrom a forensic investigation or\ninvestigatory standpoint.\n\n117\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.370\nThat presents a specific set of challenges\nfor us, because we may think we've\n\n118\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.110\nfound malware that's resident in memory,\nand indeed we probably have.\n\n119\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.341\nBut what about the software repository\nthat is feeding that malware that is,\n\n120\n00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:22.720\nperhaps, changing every time that\nmalware goes to reactivate itself.\n\n121\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.708\nPolymorphic viruses,\npolymorphic malware will do this.\n\n122\n00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:30.850\nLiterally changing and recompiling their\nfiles on the fly to present a new facade,\n\n123\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.140\na new face, a new type of\nmalware every time it activates.\n\n124\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.980\nAnd if we don't get those\nsoftware files out of the system,\n\n125\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.380\nthen we're just gonna keep reinfecting.\n\n126\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.420\nSo this is a big concern for us, and\n\n127\n00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.840\nsomething to be aware of,\nsomething to think about.\n\n128\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.024\nSo when we think about how to deal\nwith evidence collection, right?\n\n129\n00:06:47.024 --> 00:06:50.442\nWe're thinking making sure we\ngather evidence before is shut off.\n\n130\n00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:54.074\nBut what about shutting down a machine and\nactually taking it offline.\n\n131\n00:06:54.074 --> 00:06:57.617\nSo that we can then take it back\nto our warehouse, our office,\n\n132\n00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.128\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n133\n00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:03.830\nAnd we can then do an offline analysis\non it after we've tagged and bagged it.\n\n134\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.920\nWell shutting down a system may be\na little more complicated than it\n\n135\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.900\nappears to be.\n\n136\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.580\nSo, for instance, Daniel, if I asked you\nhow do we shut down a Windows machine?\n\n137\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.800\nMost of you out there, most of us,\nanybody could probably give us\n\n138\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.760\na high level walk through on how to\nshut down a Windows machine, right?\n\n139\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.570\nYou're gonna look for\nsome sort of a start menu or\n\n140\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.608\na left-hand lower left\ncorner kinda of interface.\n\n141\n00:07:24.608 --> 00:07:28.311\nYou can right-click, there's usually\nsome sort of an option to shut down.\n\n142\n00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.983\nI'm talking about shutting\nit down properly,\n\n143\n00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.100\nnot turning it off by\nusing the power function.\n\n144\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.190\nBut you know, most of us are probably\nfamiliar with something like that, right?\n\n145\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.360\nEven if we had to do it\nfrom a command line, right,\n\n146\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.250\nthrough PowerShell or the DOS Shell.\n\n147\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.670\nShut down,\ncan issue the shut down command and\n\n148\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.910\nuse the shut down command\nto be able to do that.\n\n149\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.380\nBut what about an Apple or\na Macintosh iOS based device?\n\n150\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.173\nI mean you could probably tell me how\nto do that with your eyes closed.\n\n151\n00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.050\nBut not everybody may know how to do that.\n\n152\n00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.247\nWhat about something a little more\nesoteric like a Unix or a Linux box?\n\n153\n00:07:55.247 --> 00:07:56.805\nMay or may not know how to do that.\n\n154\n00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:59.341\nLinux, probably not as difficult as Unix.\n\n155\n00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:03.057\nUnix is a little bit harder in some\nrespects a little bit more command driven,\n\n156\n00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:06.370\nno graphical interfaces for\nthe most part to work with directly.\n\n157\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.400\nSo it would be important for\nus to consider that.\n\n158\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.530\nSo, if you wanna join me here and\ntake a look for just a second,\n\n159\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.360\nI may have to go full screen here for\njust a minute,\n\n160\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.398\njust to give you an example of how these\nshutdown a UNIX or a Linux-based system.\n\n161\n00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:21.880\nIn a UNIX/LINUX operating system,\nyou can right click the menu and\n\n162\n00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.250\nopen up the console,\nclick Console to see whether or\n\n163\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.270\nnot we have a user's prompt that's logged\non, and the user's prompt is set to sign\n\n164\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.020\nmode right here or\nit's set to console mode, right.\n\n165\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.350\nAnd depending on what we see we are gonna\nhave a certain level of access, right.\n\n166\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.640\nAnd then we have to take the appropriate\nsteps by issuing the appropriate commands.\n\n167\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo you just wanna understand\nthe logic of what you're seeing.\n\n168\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.350\nAnd what I'm suggesting is that knowledge\nof file systems and operating systems\n\n169\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.990\nbecomes a crucial component of what\nwe're doing as a forensic investigator.\n\n170\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.360\nAgain, think about the logic,\nyou come up on a crime scene,\n\n171\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.960\nyou're asked to investigate a system,\nin this case a UNIX/LINUX system, and\n\n172\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.470\nif you're not familiar with it,\nyou may not be able to do anything, right?\n\n173\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.390\nAnd you have to figure out how to\nshut the system down at some point.\n\n174\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.483\nYou may call somebody up and say, hey\nI'm not familiar with it, what do I do?\n\n175\n00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:12.519\nYou may go online and\nGoogle right and figure it out,\n\n176\n00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.335\ncould probably figure that out,\nit wouldn't be too difficult.\n\n177\n00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:19.495\nBut, you know you wanna make sure you have\nat least a passing familiarity with these\n\n178\n00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:23.075\nthings because unless you specialize and\nsay, no, no, all I do is Windows, or\n\n179\n00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:25.635\nall I do is Macintosh,\nor Cisco, or whatever,\n\n180\n00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:28.297\nI'm never gonna deal with\nthose other operating systems.\n\n181\n00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:30.697\nYou're gonna come across them,\nit's only a matter of time right?\n\n182\n00:09:30.697 --> 00:09:32.637\nSo it is something to consider and\njust to be aware of.\n\n183\n00:09:32.637 --> 00:09:36.285\nIt is an important distinction in\nother words right in our minds that\n\n184\n00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:39.807\nwe want to just have at the back of\nour minds and be thinking about.\n\n185\n00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:43.707\nAll right so how do we deal with\ntagging and bagging per se.\n\n186\n00:09:43.707 --> 00:09:47.737\nWhat goes on the front of an evidence bag,\nhow do we put stuff into an evidence bag.\n\n187\n00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:50.407\nHow do we gather it and\nultimately then how do we identify it.\n\n188\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.150\nAnd what we wanna think of is three or\nfour unique identifiers, right?\n\n189\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.810\nWe should have a date and time for\nwhen the evidence was gathered.\n\n190\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.430\nAnd as a result be able\nto tell definitively\n\n191\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.320\nwhat we were doing at that time and\nwho did it.\n\n192\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.390\nSo who seized it, the date and\ntime it was seized, or the date and\n\n193\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.940\ntime it was encumbered so\nwe can then examine it.\n\n194\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.500\nYou need tracking or\nsome sort of unique exhibit number right,\n\n195\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.820\nso this is number 507,\nthe next one is 508, 509.\n\n196\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.080\nWith the crime scene tag identifier so\nthat we know it's ABC Corp and\n\n197\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.140\nthis is the fifth item we've found at the\nseventh location, whatever it would be.\n\n198\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.910\nWhere was it seized, what place within\nthe crime scene did we find it?\n\n199\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.420\nThe details of the contents in the bag.\n\n200\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.895\nYou can't just drop a computer device,\ntablet in there without saying,\n\n201\n00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:37.721\nokay, it was this particular item\nthat was found on this desk,\n\n202\n00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.122\nin this office belonged to Mr. Smith.\n\n203\n00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:43.736\nYou know that kind of thing, so you got to\nhave some notes on there, we have to have\n\n204\n00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:47.301\nunique identifying characteristics\nassociated with the evidence in order for\n\n205\n00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.975\nus to then track that back overtime.\n\n206\n00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:50.285\nMake sure you're aware of that.\n\n207\n00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:53.859\nWe talk about some common mistakes\nthat are made by first responders,\n\n208\n00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:55.381\nshutting down or rebooting.\n\n209\n00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:59.529\nIt's bad enough when you shut it down but\nyou know somebody reboots it saying okay\n\n210\n00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:03.135\nwell I restarted the computer,\njust to get rid of whatever was there.\n\n211\n00:11:03.135 --> 00:11:04.605\nYeah, you certainly did that.\n\n212\n00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:06.190\nYou probably did other stuff as well.\n\n213\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.415\nRight.\nIt's almost better if\n\n214\n00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:10.375\nyou shut it down as opposed to\nrebooting it so shutting it down and\n\n215\n00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.190\nrebooting the victim's computer\ndefinitely a big no-no.\n\n216\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.440\nAssuming that some components of the\nvictim's computer are gonna be reliable or\n\n217\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.790\nunreliable meaning, you again, hey,\nit's okay we can use that computer,\n\n218\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.440\nlet's go take it for\na drive and do something.\n\n219\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.600\nAbsolutely not.\n\n220\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.910\nNot having access to any baseline\ndocumentation about the computer,\n\n221\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.780\nmeaning what should it look like\nversus what it does look like now.\n\n222\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.610\nThere's probably not going to be a glaring\ndifference in most systems that you look\n\n223\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.650\nat that have been somehow either attacked\nor somehow modified in the sense that\n\n224\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.220\nthey probably look and feel\ntraditionally like they would normally.\n\n225\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.670\nExcept that there's obviously\nmalware resident on the system.\n\n226\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.420\nSomebody's attacked it, maybe they've\ntaken files out, put files in.\n\n227\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.320\nThey may not be obvious\nchanges in other words.\n\n228\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.610\nIf it was obvious cuz there was this\nspooky black hole that emanated from\n\n229\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.820\nthe screen that was sucking all the things\naround it in, that would be a pretty\n\n230\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.960\nobvious one we could point to and\nsay that's probably not normal, right?\n\n231\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.570\nBut the fact that it looks just\nlike a normal Windows machine\n\n232\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.570\non the surface may be deceptively calming,\nand it's really not, right?\n\n233\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.010\nThere are things going on underneath,\nwe just don't know.\n\n234\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.210\nSo if we don't know what the baseline for\nthe operational environment looks like,\n\n235\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.430\nhey, it should be a Windows 10 machine,\nor Enterprise or Pro or whatever.\n\n236\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.770\nThis, the Anniversary Update Edition, or\nwhatever it would be, based on the OS.\n\n237\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.700\nAnd we're supposed to have\nOffice 2016 on there, and\n\n238\n00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.180\nAdobe Reader version 12.2, and whatever,\nand we don't know what that looks like,\n\n239\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.580\nhow can we tell whether the systems been\nmodified or not or we just don't know.\n\n240\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.270\nSo we have to understand that and also not\ndocumenting the data collection process\n\n241\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.180\na big mistake that a lot of\nfirst time responders and\n\n242\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.728\npeople that are just starting out\nwill often make to over look things.\n\n243\n00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:52.000\nAnd it's really nonobvious things that\nare the things that often kill us.\n\n244\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.488\nThe things that are just available to us,\nthat are in plain sight, that we capture.\n\n245\n00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:56.990\nWe know, hey those things are obvious,\n\n246\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.510\nthere was something on the floor,\ntook a picture of that, right?\n\n247\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.430\nBut it's the connection of that to\nsomething else in the room that\n\n248\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.060\nmay not stand out, but as we document\neverything will become apparent later,\n\n249\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.200\nthat actually is critical or crucial.\n\n250\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.640\nAnd we see that a lot in the movies.\n\n251\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.820\nIt's kind of over-hyped.\n\n252\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.080\nWe see that a lot in TV shows.\n\n253\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.970\nIt's over-hyped.\n\n254\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.630\nYou know, it's that subtle clue\nthat nobody pays attention to but\n\n255\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.510\nthen somebody ultimately deciphers right?\n\n256\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.050\nYeah.\n\n257\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.990\nIt may not be that obvious and\nit may not be that, but I've come\n\n258\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.990\nto find over the many, many years of\ndoing this that the answers are there.\n\n259\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.820\nRight?\nThey're in the room.\n\n260\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.630\nYou just have to know to pay attention and\nbe attuned to them.\n\n261\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.170\nIt's very rare that something happens and\n\n262\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.630\nthere isn't some trace evidence\nleft behind of that activity.\n\n263\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.533\nSo you just gotta understand that\nif you pay enough attention,\n\n264\n00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:40.928\nyou will see things that don't belong and\ndo stand out as being unusual and\n\n265\n00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:42.711\ntherefore, are probably imported.\n\n266\n00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:45.741\nBut you have to be attune to them to\nunderstand that they are otherwise,\n\n267\n00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:48.315\nyou may miss the obvious things and\nthat's an issue.\n\n268\n00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:50.085\nSo can I search with or without a warrant?\n\n269\n00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:52.895\nWe have this conversation free\nthe end of our last episode.\n\n270\n00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:55.545\nI mentioned that we would come back to it.\n\n271\n00:13:55.545 --> 00:13:58.035\nWe would talk some more about it here.\n\n272\n00:13:58.035 --> 00:14:00.665\nAnd I wanted to bring up a couple\nof things that are helpful for\n\n273\n00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.035\nus with this regard.\n\n274\n00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.725\nI wanna take a look here, I mentioned\nthat there were what we call incidents,\n\n275\n00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:05.770\ncircumstances.\n\n276\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.860\nThat may come into play here and\nwe wanna be aware of the fact\n\n277\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.120\nthat we can search without a warrant\nunder certain circumstances, right?\n\n278\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.510\nImminent destruction\nof evidence as I said,\n\n279\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.810\nis one of the things that would\nlead us to be able to do this.\n\n280\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.710\nThere are some cases in the United\nStates Supreme Court or case law\n\n281\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.440\nthat we would reference here, again\nI know we are being country specific,\n\n282\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.510\nI know we are being US centric when\nwe talk about this stuff, I get that.\n\n283\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.250\nI do understand that.\n\n284\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.670\nWe fully acknowledge that.\n\n285\n00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.780\nBut I wanna point out that from an exam\npreparation perspective, this is\n\n286\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.518\nthe information that may be valuable\nto you while we're referencing it.\n\n287\n00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:42.200\nOr there are other cases around the world,\nanother legal systems\n\n288\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.730\nthat would essentially lead\nus to the same conclusion?\n\n289\n00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.550\nAbsolutely, without a doubt, there are.\n\n290\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.660\nBut we're not talking about those,\nwe're talking about the ones specifically\n\n291\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.330\nin the United States that\nare what we consider landmark or\n\n292\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.140\nseminal cases in this regard.\n\n293\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.260\nSo, United States versus David.\n\n294\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.950\nSee the reference to it here.\n\n295\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.840\nThat is the case that decided and\nultimately,\n\n296\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.440\nlet us to believe that we have a standard\nfor imminent destruction of evidence\n\n297\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.970\nis being a allowable exception for\nsearching without a warrant.\n\n298\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.800\nAlso, consent of person with authority,\nI talked about this.\n\n299\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.770\nSchneckloth versus Bustamante.\n\n300\n00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.830\nAgain, a seminal case,\n1973 is when this case was tried.\n\n301\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.820\nSo if I was you preparing for the exam,\nwanna associate the concept of the two\n\n302\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.205\nexceptions for\nsearching without a warrant.\n\n303\n00:15:24.205 --> 00:15:27.250\nWanna know what they are, associate\nthem with the appropriate case, and\n\n304\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.420\nknow the United States versus David\nVersus Schneckloth versus Bustamonte,\n\n305\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.700\nwould be the appropriate\nthings to consider there.\n\n306\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.990\nWhat do I see, what do I need to know?\n\n307\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.220\nWhen an incident occurs, what kind\nof information can we often gather?\n\n308\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.620\nAnd this results, are we going to?\n\n309\n00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.283\nI need to be aware of since we're here,\nsome of the, make a little enter there, so\n\n310\n00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:45.932\nwe could see.\n\n311\n00:15:45.932 --> 00:15:46.782\nWe go full screen for\n\n312\n00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:49.393\njust a second because I just\nknocked that down below the line.\n\n313\n00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:53.055\nSo you could see it, you'll see here we\ntalked about things like data and time,\n\n314\n00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:55.088\nright, very important to be aware of that.\n\n315\n00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:57.474\nTalked about place and\nlocation of the incident.\n\n316\n00:15:57.474 --> 00:16:01.645\nEvidence from a volatile system and\nnon volatile evidence right.\n\n317\n00:16:01.645 --> 00:16:04.110\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n318\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.900\nDetails of the person or people that\nwere present at the crime scene.\n\n319\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.845\nImportant to consider and also name and\n\n320\n00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:13.310\nidentification of people or persons\nthat could serve as potential witnesses.\n\n321\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.480\nWanna be able to gather this information,\nright, we should know this.\n\n322\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.109\nNothing worse than going back and trying\nto interview witnesses to a crime, and\n\n323\n00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:23.640\nnot having a complete understanding\nof who they were, where they are.\n\n324\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.520\nAnd as a result,\nbeing able to talk to them after the fact,\n\n325\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.250\nespecially because most evidence gathered\n\n326\n00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.960\ndoes not immediately wind up before\na judge in a court of law the next day.\n\n327\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.990\nIt could take weeks, months, years in some\ncases to walk through all the procedural\n\n328\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.450\nhurdles and processes, and the wrangling\nthat takes place before you wind up in\n\n329\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:48.200\na court of law, presenting evidence and\nhaving to potentially testify at a trial.\n\n330\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.660\nAnd as a result of that, those abilities,\nor that ability to track back\n\n331\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.890\nto those witnesses and find them and\nmaintain contact with them is so\n\n332\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.780\ncrucial because, over time,\nthose things can become hard to remember.\n\n333\n00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.860\nAnd you may not be able\nto find those people.\n\n334\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.564\nSo we do need to just think about that.\n\n335\n00:17:04.564 --> 00:17:07.479\nSo I mentioned that we would take\na look at what do I collect and\n\n336\n00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:09.490\nhow do I engage in the idea of collection.\n\n337\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.990\nSo let me show you the website that I had\nup a moment ago when we flashed back in\n\n338\n00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.334\nhere and it kinda went away.\n\n339\n00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:17.500\nBut what we collect and\nhow do I collect it?\n\n340\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.360\nIt's a great network,\nor a great webpage and\n\n341\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.780\na great website to go to,\ncrimesceneinvestigator.net.\n\n342\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.850\nSo this one, the obvious obligatory\nbecome a CSI person that's good.\n\n343\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.971\nBut they have a great set of\nguidelines here in evidence collection\n\n344\n00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:34.990\nEvidence Collection Manuals that\nyou can download and access.\n\n345\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.070\nEvidence Collection Bulletins,\nall sorts of stuff, latent prints,\n\n346\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.050\nhuman bodies, gunshot residue.\n\n347\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.110\nSome stuff you would probably\nbe into there Daniel, I'm sure,\n\n348\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.620\nglass fragments, right?\n\n349\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.610\nFiber and hair, all sorts of stuff,\nautomobile lights, right?\n\n350\n00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.212\nSo all sorts of really cool stuff about,\nand\n\n351\n00:17:50.212 --> 00:17:52.343\nyou can see this sometimes in\nthose crime dramas, right?\n\n352\n00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.815\nWe tracked them back based on\nthe tire marks right, that we found.\n\n353\n00:17:55.815 --> 00:17:58.878\nSo there's certain kinds of unique\ncharacteristics about certain\n\n354\n00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:01.250\nkinds of tires or shoe prints and\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n355\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.760\nAnd a lot of this is stuff that's\nwritten up, and that you can find.\n\n356\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.576\nSo there's some stuff here.\n\n357\n00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:09.827\nThere's a bunch of video presentations,\nhow you collect and preserve evidence,\n\n358\n00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:12.030\na whole set of guidelines on this.\n\n359\n00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.640\nSome really cool stuff in here.\n\n360\n00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.410\nPlus, they have really cool t-shirts.\n\n361\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.037\nSo you can also take a look at\nthat they have a little dead body,\n\n362\n00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:19.010\nchalk outline shirt.\n\n363\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.670\nThat's kind of a cool one, right?\n\n364\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.882\nBe that guy who shows up at the bar-\n&gt;&gt; That's right with the-\n\n365\n00:18:23.882 --> 00:18:25.877\n&gt;&gt; With the dead body outline on your\n\n366\n00:18:25.877 --> 00:18:26.750\nshirt right.\n\n367\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.950\nSo, taking a look at this one would\nobviously be helpful for you.\n\n368\n00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.420\nLet me be clear, I'm not suggesting\nyou gotta go in and read up any or\n\n369\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.310\nall of those things unless you want to.\n\n370\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.250\nIf you're interested in\nan obviously great resource for\n\n371\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.180\nyou to gather some of that\ndocumentation for free so\n\n372\n00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.090\nyou don't have to go out and buy those\nmanuals, you can look at them there.\n\n373\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.393\nAnd for the exam,\nnot suggesting as I said,\n\n374\n00:18:45.393 --> 00:18:48.078\nthat you have to be up to\ndate on those particulars.\n\n375\n00:18:48.078 --> 00:18:50.895\nJust pointing out there's a lot of\nresources out there that may prove to be\n\n376\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:51.631\nvaluable for you.\n\n377\n00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.534\nWith regards to evidence collection,\nif we can go back and take a look.\n\n378\n00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:57.684\nYou'll often find forms like\nthis if we could there we go,\n\n379\n00:18:57.684 --> 00:19:01.690\nyou'll find we have evidence\ncollection forms, it's a standard form.\n\n380\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.762\nOne that looks something like this,\nwhatever it may be, and you will\n\n381\n00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:12.536\nsee here that we have case number,\nunique identifier, the type of case it is,\n\n382\n00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:17.355\ndate and time, who is filling our\nthe report, things like that.\n\n383\n00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:22.170\nWe have the ability to go in and actually,\nlet me zoom in there a little bit.\n\n384\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.151\nThere we go a little bit better but you\nstarted to realize I forgot to zoom in.\n\n385\n00:19:25.151 --> 00:19:28.921\nSo you have the type of the case or\nthe crime, your property status is\n\n386\n00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:33.330\nin evidence, recovered, stolen,\nfound, whatever the case may be.\n\n387\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.890\nWhat's the name of the victim,\nthe suspect, the race, date of birth,\n\n388\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.460\naddress, pertinent contact information,\nright, things like that.\n\n389\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.820\nWhat's the item number,\nthe quantity that was found.\n\n390\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.550\nSo the exact inventory accounting,\nif you will.\n\n391\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:52.330\nWhere is this information being tracked,\nwhat kind of things we're finding,\n\n392\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.870\nthere's tool marks, there's glass,\nthere's chemistry, there's evidence.\n\n393\n00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.090\nThere's boxes for different things\ndepending what we're doing.\n\n394\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.160\nThere's some narrative or note fields\nthere where we can write some stuff up.\n\n395\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.790\nIt's a standard generic form.\n\n396\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.630\nIt may be modified, you may see\ndifferent versions of this form.\n\n397\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.380\nThis is just you know one of hundreds you\ncan find out on the internet as templates.\n\n398\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.200\nBut, it's the standard idea of what\nwe're doing documenting that information\n\n399\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.260\nthat we're going after here.\n\n400\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.990\nAs an investigator you'll build\nup a library of these forms.\n\n401\n00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.700\nYour organization especially\nif you work in law enforcement\n\n402\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.270\nwill have a body of these forms\nthat are standardized for\n\n403\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.195\nthe jurisdiction based on whatever you\nwork with if you're in private practice.\n\n404\n00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:31.092\nYou'll have a set of these forms that you\ncreate and that you'll use if you work for\n\n405\n00:20:31.092 --> 00:20:33.523\nan individual company on staff,\nthe company may or\n\n406\n00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:36.596\nmay not have these decked out with\ntheir logos things like that.\n\n407\n00:20:36.596 --> 00:20:40.383\nBut whatever the case may be you'll\nfigure out how to use these things and\n\n408\n00:20:40.383 --> 00:20:41.449\nput them together.\n\n409\n00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:45.278\nBut literally all I did was just go out,\ndo a quick Google search,\n\n410\n00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:47.240\nevidence collection form.\n\n411\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.164\nAnd just clicked on one or\n\n412\n00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.112\ntwo entries just to show what they would\nlook like there just so you can see them.\n\n413\n00:20:51.112 --> 00:20:56.004\nWe have all sorts of examples of this kind\nof this kinda stuff in terms of what we\n\n414\n00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:57.525\nhave and what we can do.\n\n415\n00:20:57.525 --> 00:21:00.206\nWas so good we thought we'd show it to you\ntwice cuz second time around seemed better\n\n416\n00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:00.869\nthan the first one.\n\n417\n00:21:00.869 --> 00:21:02.900\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have all that and\n\n418\n00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.858\nwe have the ability of course to\nbe able to go in and utilize and\n\n419\n00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:07.777\nleverage those forms when necessary.\n\n420\n00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:11.261\nWe should list all the systems involved\nas you saw, we should have and\n\n421\n00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:14.506\nreally document the order of\nvolatility around those systems,\n\n422\n00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:17.495\nrecord any clock drift on\na system that may be involved.\n\n423\n00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:18.904\nThis is actually an interesting and\nimportant one.\n\n424\n00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:21.800\nWhen we're gathering evidence\non an individual system,\n\n425\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.580\nwe have to look at the system clock.\n\n426\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.570\nSo you often go down to the sys tray,\nthere's clock icon or\n\n427\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.269\nsomething there you can find\nthe time on the system.\n\n428\n00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:31.993\nOn this one here, right, if I click here,\n\n429\n00:21:31.993 --> 00:21:36.850\nyou'll see it's 3:20 PM Eastern\nStandard Time on Friday, June 2nd.\n\n430\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.030\nIt's kinda hard to see, it's blue,\nbut Friday, June 2nd, right?\n\n431\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.710\nSo I would look at that as\nan investigator that's not changing\n\n432\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.070\nanything I'm just clicking\non the interface.\n\n433\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.161\nI haven't modified the system time or\nanything, but\n\n434\n00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:48.233\nI have a sense of what it is.\n\n435\n00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:52.101\nI may cross reference that and validate\nthat by going into the command line and\n\n436\n00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:55.673\nshowing the time command to make sure\nit does register legitimately and\n\n437\n00:21:55.673 --> 00:21:57.599\nit would jive and most likely sync up.\n\n438\n00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:01.961\nBut if we're a member of, for instance in\nWindows, a domain, we would have to see\n\n439\n00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:06.009\nwhether or not we're synching that clock\nfrom a group policy perspective or\n\n440\n00:22:06.009 --> 00:22:09.130\na network time protocol\nperspective to another machine.\n\n441\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.080\nTypically a domain controller,\nor a network time interface.\n\n442\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.723\nSome kind of a rack mounted time device.\n\n443\n00:22:14.723 --> 00:22:19.398\nWe'd have to know that, because if there's\ntime drift involve meaning our system\n\n444\n00:22:19.398 --> 00:22:23.404\nsays 320 but the network time\ninterface that we're using to sync off\n\n445\n00:22:23.404 --> 00:22:28.150\nof says 3:30 there's a 10 minute\ndifferential or delta between the two.\n\n446\n00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.881\nSomebody's modified the clock on\nthis system and monkeyed around or\n\n447\n00:22:31.881 --> 00:22:35.428\nmessed with the interface to decouple it,\nto desynchronize it.\n\n448\n00:22:35.428 --> 00:22:36.848\nThat's an important clue,\n\n449\n00:22:36.848 --> 00:22:41.470\nbecause chances are good that something\nhas happened that required that to occur.\n\n450\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.550\nAnd that's important, because that means\ntimestamps on the local system for logs,\n\n451\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.290\nfor entries having to do with when files\nwere accessed, all that kinda stuff,\n\n452\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.835\nare gonna be off by ten minutes.\n\n453\n00:22:50.835 --> 00:22:54.745\nAnd that may be the differential that\nhides the activity that the bad actor was\n\n454\n00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:55.897\nlooking to engage in.\n\n455\n00:22:55.897 --> 00:22:59.520\nAnd so unraveling this piece of\nthe puzzle, very very important.\n\n456\n00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.170\nWe have to know that.\n\n457\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.090\nAnd something simple but\n\n458\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.639\nwe often overlook the obvious things\nthat are staring us in the face.\n\n459\n00:23:03.639 --> 00:23:07.781\n&gt;&gt; That brings up a question in mine\nof how difficult is it if a hacker\n\n460\n00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:10.313\nis good enough and smart enough to say,\n\n461\n00:23:10.313 --> 00:23:15.460\nI'm going to fiddle with the time\non this clock so that logs are off.\n\n462\n00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:20.680\nDoes that make it more difficult for\nyou to submit those logs as evidence\n\n463\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:27.210\nother than just going we see there's a\ntime differentiation of ten minutes or so.\n\n464\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.760\nDoes that really call into question\nthe veracity of them because they\n\n465\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.635\nhave been altered?\n\n466\n00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:32.690\n&gt;&gt; It definitely does.\n\n467\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.180\nAnd if we cannot, so yeah, the short\nanswer unequivocal is absolutely.\n\n468\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.574\nIf there is evidence and that we can\nshow that there has been modification of\n\n469\n00:23:41.574 --> 00:23:45.639\nthe time source and as a result\nthe clock in the system is not correct.\n\n470\n00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:48.531\nThen that does call into\nquestion whether the logs,\n\n471\n00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:52.998\nanything having to do with time stamped\ninformation on that system is accurate,\n\n472\n00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:57.607\nbecause clearly there's been an attempt\nto cover something up and to modify time.\n\n473\n00:23:57.607 --> 00:23:59.232\nIs one of the ways to do that.\n\n474\n00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:03.746\nThat doesn't mean that we may not or may\nbe able to introduce those into evidence.\n\n475\n00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:08.547\nBut it does mean that they are now\nsuspect, and that we have to be even more\n\n476\n00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:13.300\nmeticulous and more focused on our\nanalysis to validate what was done.\n\n477\n00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.877\nAnd we may very well wind up displaying\nthose and bringing them into evidence to\n\n478\n00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:20.020\nshow that, yes indeed,\nthere was modification of the time.\n\n479\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.659\nHere's what we uncovered looking for\nthat ten minute gap.\n\n480\n00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:26.174\nWe found that all the log files or\nthe entries had been shifted by\n\n481\n00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:29.292\nten minutes to cover behavior\nthat took place earlier or\n\n482\n00:24:29.292 --> 00:24:32.970\nlater and were throwing off\nthe investigator in that trail.\n\n483\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.692\nWe may show or\nuse them as evidence to illustrate that.\n\n484\n00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:41.487\nBut then again, depending on the nature\nof the malfunction or the modification,\n\n485\n00:24:41.487 --> 00:24:43.720\nit may have been accidental, right?\n\n486\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.369\nSo, clocks will drift.\n\n487\n00:24:45.369 --> 00:24:46.592\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that is a fairly\n\n488\n00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:50.470\nnormal behavior in a system with no\nmalware, no modification of any kind.\n\n489\n00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.690\nBut not by ten minutes, right?\n\n490\n00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.625\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; It may be off by a few seconds,\n\n491\n00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.826\nthings like that.\n\n492\n00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:59.390\nAnd if the CMOS battery starts to go,\nit could affect the system clock.\n\n493\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.715\nThere are things that will go wrong,\nright, that can cause the system to\n\n494\n00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:06.200\ndisplay incorrect time that has\nnothing to do with hacking of that.\n\n495\n00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.814\nWe could eliminate obvious things,\nand say, yeah,\n\n496\n00:25:08.814 --> 00:25:10.827\nno the battery was going\nbad in the system.\n\n497\n00:25:10.827 --> 00:25:14.510\nThat's why the clock appeared to be\noff and we can account for that.\n\n498\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.230\nThere is no other suspicious activity.\n\n499\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.740\nThere would be mitigating factors, right?\n\n500\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.410\nThere could be.\n\n501\n00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.110\nBut in general,\nit would lead us to be more suspect,\n\n502\n00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.020\nmore circumspect around\nwhat that information was.\n\n503\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.900\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n504\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.566\nSo, taking a look at that.\n\n505\n00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:29.845\nMaking sure we know all\nthe unique system identifiers.\n\n506\n00:25:29.845 --> 00:25:34.377\nWhat's the unique identifier is\nprobably the license code for\n\n507\n00:25:34.377 --> 00:25:36.438\ninstance, serial number.\n\n508\n00:25:36.438 --> 00:25:38.870\nThings like that are unique\ntypically to a machine.\n\n509\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.720\nWe wanna make sure we check and\nvalidate all that.\n\n510\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.180\nMaking sure that we have\nsome sort of integrity\n\n511\n00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.850\nthought process in mind around the media,\nbut also around the baseline.\n\n512\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.400\nIs there anti-malware software on it,\nand virus software?\n\n513\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.610\nIf so, is it up to date, as far as we know\nis the system infected with anything?\n\n514\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.724\nYes or no, and if so, what?\n\n515\n00:25:56.724 --> 00:25:57.525\nThose kinda things.\n\n516\n00:25:57.525 --> 00:26:01.037\nWe'd wanna be collecting all\nthis kind of information and\n\n517\n00:26:01.037 --> 00:26:03.624\nunderstanding what that information is.\n\n518\n00:26:03.624 --> 00:26:06.307\nIf we don't have a good background and\nbaseline for that,\n\n519\n00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:08.661\nmay be very difficult for\nus to certify the system,\n\n520\n00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:11.620\nand to then introduce information\nabout it into evidence.\n\n521\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.760\nSo it is important to consider that.\n\n522\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.200\nOr we may not be able to\ntell the complete story,\n\n523\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.360\nis probably another way\nto think about that.\n\n524\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.764\nAnd we do have to bear\nthat in mind as well.\n\n525\n00:26:18.764 --> 00:26:22.988\nSo electronic evidence consists of any\nnumber of things that are gathered,\n\n526\n00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:27.674\nboth volatile and non-volatile data that\npoints to the current state of the machine\n\n527\n00:26:27.674 --> 00:26:31.832\nand the alternate state, the state that\nit was in prior to being modified or\n\n528\n00:26:31.832 --> 00:26:32.838\nbeing attacked.\n\n529\n00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:35.955\nAnd the current state now in the delta,\nthe gap between the two,\n\n530\n00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:38.923\nall of that information helps\nus to tell a compelling story.\n\n531\n00:26:38.923 --> 00:26:40.725\nAnd so we wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n532\n00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:45.490\nWe've talked about chain of custody and\nhow important chain of custody is.\n\n533\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.680\nWhen we think about chain of custody, we\nare thinking about the ability to be able\n\n534\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.240\nto tell the story of where that evidence\nhas been, under whose control, for\n\n535\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.780\nhow long, and in what circumstances\nfrom the time it has been tagged and\n\n536\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.550\nbagged until the time it is\ngiven back to whoever owns or\n\n537\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.510\nis destroyed at the end of the need for\nit.\n\n538\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.770\nEvery moment in between must be accounted\nfor unequivocally without exception.\n\n539\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.029\nAnd we've talked about\nthe importance of chain of custody.\n\n540\n00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:10.700\nWe've also talked about the fact that\nwe often have chain of custody forms.\n\n541\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.900\nThought it would be good to show you\nwhat a chain of custody form looks like.\n\n542\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.220\nAgain, couple of samples here.\n\n543\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.850\nIf we can go full-screen,\njust to show you this.\n\n544\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.500\nSo this one, just a Word document.\n\n545\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.460\nYou can see evidence chain of custody\ntracking form, case number, right?\n\n546\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.557\nSubmitting officer, this is the police\nthought processor one geared around\n\n547\n00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:30.582\na police department, so you can see.\n\n548\n00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:33.720\nIt's got specific law enforcement\nreferences, like victim, suspect,\n\n549\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.870\ndate/time seized, location of seizure.\n\n550\n00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.775\nAnd then, information about the evidence\nand then chain on custody, right?\n\n551\n00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:44.530\nSo you could see here that we\nhave the item number, date, time,\n\n552\n00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.860\nreleased by, signature, and id number,\nsome sort of unique tracking number.\n\n553\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.447\nMaybe a badge number in this case,\n\n554\n00:27:49.447 --> 00:27:52.313\nor whatever it may be,\nsince it's a police officer, right?\n\n555\n00:27:52.313 --> 00:27:54.720\nReceived by, comments, location, and\n\n556\n00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.625\nthat's just a chart that\ngoes down as you can see.\n\n557\n00:27:57.625 --> 00:28:01.820\nAnd then, the tracking from just\ncontinues and kind of just is used there.\n\n558\n00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.032\nAnd then final disposition authority,\nright, authorization for disposal.\n\n559\n00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:09.139\nThis item pertaining to this case,\nthis suspect etc.,\n\n560\n00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:13.753\nis either being returned to owner or is\nbeing auctioned, destroyed, or diverted.\n\n561\n00:28:13.753 --> 00:28:15.551\nThere's different options,\noutcomes, again,\n\n562\n00:28:15.551 --> 00:28:17.920\ndepending on the nature of\nthe organization that has this.\n\n563\n00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.036\nWho's signing that they're giving them\nthe authority to be able to do that.\n\n564\n00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:23.090\nWitness to destruction, so\nif you are destroying it,\n\n565\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.674\nyou have to have a witness that\nsays it really was destroyed.\n\n566\n00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:27.318\nYeah, I got rid of all that cash,\nI burned it.\n\n567\n00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:29.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course you did, right?\n\n568\n00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.070\nAbsolutely, all the drugs when\nin the bonfire, your honor,\n\n569\n00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.234\nabsolutely, no problem, right?\n\n570\n00:28:32.234 --> 00:28:33.924\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I promise.\n\n571\n00:28:33.924 --> 00:28:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n572\n00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.430\nOr release to lawful owner here, you\ncould see items in the document, right,\n\n573\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.040\nwere released to the lawful owner.\n\n574\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.800\nSo you can see here that there is\na lot of stuff that has to happen.\n\n575\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.624\nNow, in addition, we may have a slightly\ndifferent take on this, evidence property,\n\n576\n00:28:48.624 --> 00:28:49.406\nyou can see here.\n\n577\n00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:51.170\nI'm gonna just zoom in here for\none second.\n\n578\n00:28:52.730 --> 00:29:00.040\nSo you can see this one, and this one\nis going to be one for the military.\n\n579\n00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.620\nAnd so this is\na US Army Criminal Investigative Command,\n\n580\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.850\nthe CIC, evidence or property custodial\ndocument, very similar, right?\n\n581\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.860\nLaw enforcement entity within the Army,\nin this case.\n\n582\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.350\nBut again, you have a receiving activity,\nyou have a location.\n\n583\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.185\nYou've got the name and grade and\ntitle of the person who received it.\n\n584\n00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:23.940\nSo essentially, who the intake\nofficer was, the address, all that.\n\n585\n00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.710\nWhere it's obtained, reason,\ntime, date, item, and quantity,\n\n586\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.770\ncould see all that here.\n\n587\n00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.820\nThen the chain of custody information.\n\n588\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.610\nInstead of badge number or\nunique identifier,\n\n589\n00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.639\nyou see a name, grade, or title.\n\n590\n00:29:35.639 --> 00:29:38.854\nCuz this is the military,\nprobably gonna be Sergeant so and so,\n\n591\n00:29:38.854 --> 00:29:41.200\nColonel so and so, or whatever.\n\n592\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.293\nAnd so we're gonna have that.\n\n593\n00:29:43.293 --> 00:29:45.760\nSo we have that purpose\nof change of custody.\n\n594\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.153\nWhy are we doing this, right?\n\n595\n00:29:47.153 --> 00:29:50.275\nHas to be documented there,\nall of these, right?\n\n596\n00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:52.870\nJust kind of chart as we go down.\n\n597\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.660\nThere's the final disposition action,\nfinal disposition authority,\n\n598\n00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.850\nwitness to destruction of evidence.\n\n599\n00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.540\nStandardized thought process,\n\n600\n00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.810\nthose boxes, that information in some form\nis gonna appear in every one of these.\n\n601\n00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.037\nAnd you're going to see that\nregardless of who creates the form,\n\n602\n00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:11.613\nwhether it's law enforcement, whether it's\nmilitary, whether it's a private entity,\n\n603\n00:30:11.613 --> 00:30:15.486\nyou should have those standard things\nbecause those are the things that we look\n\n604\n00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:19.386\nfor and that we audit for and we verify,\nshould be in the document at all times.\n\n605\n00:30:19.386 --> 00:30:22.680\nThis is the standardized way,\nthe templated way that we do this.\n\n606\n00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.350\nThis is one of those things that there\nis a right and a wrong way to do.\n\n607\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.540\nThe right way is the form that you've\nseen, the wrong way would be to modify\n\n608\n00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.270\nthat in detail, or rather,\ndeviate from that by leaving things out or\n\n609\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.500\nnot fully filling it out or not fully\nhaving it documented that everybody that\n\n610\n00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.750\ntouched the information or\nthe item had to sign in and sign out.\n\n611\n00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.080\nThat would be the wrong way.\n\n612\n00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.670\nThe right way would be to have a form\nthat looked something like this, and\n\n613\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.520\nto follow this and implement this\nstandard this particular way.\n\n614\n00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.060\nSo, wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n615\n00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.450\nBut essentially, a legal document that\ndemonstrates a progression of evidence\n\n616\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.900\nfrom the time it is gathered\nuntil the time it is disposed of\n\n617\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.450\nis what the chain of custody\nis going to represent for us.\n\n618\n00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.770\nThe forms can be introduced in\na court of law to validate.\n\n619\n00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.470\nAnd an evidence log that people did or\n\n620\n00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.840\ndid not come into contact with the\nevidence at certain points in time, right?\n\n621\n00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.740\nSo it's very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n622\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.690\nWhat is the most important rule that\nwe can think about, verbalize, and\n\n623\n00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:16.500\ntalk about with regards to the forensic\nprocess and the management of evidence?\n\n624\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.260\nAnybody, anybody?\n\n625\n00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.890\nBueller, Bueller?\n\n626\n00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Do unto others.\n\n627\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.815\n&gt;&gt; Do unto others.\n\n628\n00:31:19.815 --> 00:31:21.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, it's the Golden Rule.\n&gt;&gt; Not quite, right?\n\n629\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.720\nInstead of do unto others,\nit would be do unto copies,\n\n630\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.060\nas opposed to do unto originals, right?\n\n631\n00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.638\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n632\n00:31:26.638 --> 00:31:27.830\n&gt;&gt; You never do unto originals.\n\n633\n00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.301\nIn other words, never, ever,\never use original evidence.\n\n634\n00:31:30.301 --> 00:31:31.940\nYou always use copies of evidence.\n\n635\n00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.041\nBecause remember, as we've talked about,\nyou only get shot at being an original.\n\n636\n00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:36.920\nAfter that, you are no longer an original.\n\n637\n00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.838\nYou are a pale imitation, and\nif we screw up the original, we're done.\n\n638\n00:31:39.838 --> 00:31:41.647\n&gt;&gt; A poser.\n\n639\n00:31:41.647 --> 00:31:44.131\n&gt;&gt; You are exactly that,\nwe are done, right?\n\n640\n00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:47.909\nAnd so we have to understand and be aware\nof the fact we never get a second chance\n\n641\n00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:50.890\nto put that pristine evidence\nback together again, right?\n\n642\n00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.420\nIt's gotta be kept pristine.\n\n643\n00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.700\nWe cannot use it.\n\n644\n00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.560\nWe can take copies of it,\nforensically sound copies can be made.\n\n645\n00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.080\nThat is an acceptable and\nallowable methodology and approach.\n\n646\n00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.570\nAnd we encourage the use of that approach.\n\n647\n00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.570\nAnd then, once that's done,\nmake as many copies as you need.\n\n648\n00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.560\nValidate them, hash them,\n\n649\n00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.420\ncreate the integrity cross walk,\nensure that they are legitimate copies.\n\n650\n00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.310\nAnd then, go to town on those and\ndo whatever you wanna do to them.\n\n651\n00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.610\nCarve them up, break them,\nthrow them away, make as many as you need.\n\n652\n00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.474\nCrunch will make more.\n\n653\n00:32:17.474 --> 00:32:18.326\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; As they used to say, right?\n\n654\n00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:19.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we could do that.\n\n655\n00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.670\nBut you gotta work on the copies,\nnot the original.\n\n656\n00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.277\nVery important for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n657\n00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:27.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right, never ever ever,\nagain, we can't reiterate it more.\n\n658\n00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.981\nDefinitely never use the original because\nyou'll lose the integrity, right?\n\n659\n00:32:30.981 --> 00:32:33.594\nIt starts casting that shadow\nof doubt on whether or\n\n660\n00:32:33.594 --> 00:32:35.490\nnot the original has been modified.\n\n661\n00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.117\n&gt;&gt; It's a black hole of doubt,\nthere's no shadow.\n\n662\n00:32:38.117 --> 00:32:39.153\nIt is a black hole of doubt, right there.\n\n663\n00:32:39.153 --> 00:32:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we don't want that, so\nnothing but copies, that's right.\n\n664\n00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.120\nMake those copies, modify the copies.\n\n665\n00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.630\nAdam thanks for\n\n666\n00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.650\nshowing us the cool resources on\ndoing the tagging and bagging.\n\n667\n00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.778\nVery cool stuff to see those forms and\n\n668\n00:32:50.778 --> 00:32:54.495\nwhat they look like to see what you\ncan expect to have to fill out.\n\n669\n00:32:54.495 --> 00:32:57.247\nAnd the detail that goes\ninto those things is very,\n\n670\n00:32:57.247 --> 00:33:01.026\nvery important to make sure that\nthey're all done in the correct way,\n\n671\n00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:04.117\nand like Adam said,\nnot modified for your own purposes.\n\n672\n00:33:04.117 --> 00:33:05.865\nThat's not what we wanna get\nin the business of doing.\n\n673\n00:33:05.865 --> 00:33:07.990\nYou wanna stick to the standard.\n\n674\n00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.690\nThat being said, we have plenty more to\ngo in this topic, but we are out of time.\n\n675\n00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.655\nSo we're gonna have to come back for,\nI think, we're in Part 6 now.\n\n676\n00:33:14.655 --> 00:33:15.984\n&gt;&gt; You know what the scary part is?\n\n677\n00:33:15.984 --> 00:33:18.447\nWe're at half of it now.\n&gt;&gt; I know, there's a lot of information,\n\n678\n00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:21.330\nbut it is necessary information for\nyou folks out there.\n\n679\n00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.848\nSo join us in Part 6, we'll be back.\n\n680\n00:33:23.848 --> 00:33:28.855\nOr as I like to call it, Part 5,\nPart 2 [LAUGH] right, for that one.\n\n681\n00:33:28.855 --> 00:33:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Third book, second implementation.\n\n682\n00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.593\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, so as for\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n683\n00:33:33.593 --> 00:33:34.398\nclose her down.\n\n684\n00:33:34.398 --> 00:33:35.613\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n685\n00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:38.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've

00:00:12.020\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.151\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:20.549\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:23.167\nwe are back with more on\nour CHFI version 9 series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.307\nIt just tastes so good,\nwe had to have a little bit more.\n\n8\n00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:29.264\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.935\nAdam, glad to have you again\nto continue this conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:33.232\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always glad to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:37.329\nI brought my appetite with me, so because\nit's tasty, we'll jump right in and\n\n12\n00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.550\ntake a nibble of privacy, and privacy\nrelated search and seizure concerns.\n\n13\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.025\nAs an investigator, as a CHFI,\nas we've been talking about,\n\n14\n00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.674\nin our prior conversations.\n\n15\n00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:50.571\nWe've been going through the logic, the\nthought process of some of the legalities\n\n16\n00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.070\naround how we operate,\nwhat the investigative process looks like.\n\n17\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.945\nIts methodology, but also,\nwhat are the federal rules of evidence\n\n18\n00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.115\nin the United States that\ngovern our behavior, and\n\n19\n00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:00.489\nhow do we address those things?\n\n20\n00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.689\nSearching and\nseizing is part of that conversation,\n\n21\n00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.260\ndo we have the right to do so, absolutely.\n\n22\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.684\nDo we have the right to do so with or\nwithout a warrant, it depends.\n\n23\n00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:13.730\nSo we really have to understand what may\nor may not be allowed based on something\n\n24\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.107\nwe've talked about already, this concept\nof exigent circumstance that comes up.\n\n25\n00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:22.109\nWhere perhaps there are circumstances\nhappening in the real world at\n\n26\n00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.421\nthe moment that we are involved\nin looking for evidence,\n\n27\n00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:30.044\nor finding out that there is something\ngoing on that may require our attention,\n\n28\n00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:32.882\nthat could lead to\nthe destruction of evidence.\n\n29\n00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:36.989\nAnd if that is the case, we may be able\nto act without a search warrant, without\n\n30\n00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.975\nthe legal permission from a judge that\nsays it is allowable for you to go in and\n\n31\n00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:45.350\nsearch for these things in this area\nat this time under these circumstances.\n\n32\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.290\nSo we have some opportunity here,\n\n33\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.780\nthere is some what we would call carved\nout space or room that we can operate in.\n\n34\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.450\nBut we have to be very specific,\nwe have to be very detailed and understand\n\n35\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.150\nthe exact boundaries, parameters of what\nwe are allowed and are not allowed to do.\n\n36\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.746\nAnd keep in mind that when\nwe're talking about this,\n\n37\n00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:06.266\nwe're primarily exclusively really\ntalking about law enforcement and\n\n38\n00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.395\ntheir representatives operating\nin a search and seizure mode.\n\n39\n00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.530\nThis is not a private citizen going in and\nattempting to search for evidence.\n\n40\n00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.200\nThis is a law enforcement official that\nwould normally need a search warrant, or\n\n41\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.942\na duly appointed representative of the law\nenforcement officials that would need\n\n42\n00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.055\na search warrant.\n\n43\n00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:29.126\nAnd under certain circumstances,\nmay act without that warrant, in order to\n\n44\n00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:34.470\npreserve evidence and to take care of or\nsafeguard life as well as property.\n\n45\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.800\nDue to whatever compelling situation or\n\n46\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.916\ncompelling circumstances in\nthat situation may be going on.\n\n47\n00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:43.330\nSo if the government's\nconduct does not violate\n\n48\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.370\na person's reasonable expectation\nof privacy, as we define it,\n\n49\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.640\nthen formally we do not have an issue with\nthe Fourth Amendment in the United States.\n\n50\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.920\nThe search, therefore, can be\nconducted and no warrant is required.\n\n51\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.200\nThe key here is whether we violate\nthe perceived reasonable expectation of\n\n52\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.840\nprivacy, defined under\nthe US Constitution's Fourth Amendment.\n\n53\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.180\nThis has been laid out, again, through\nthe Supreme Court, in a landmark case,\n\n54\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.550\nKatz versus United States,\n1967 is when this court case was heard.\n\n55\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.390\nJustice Harlin was the justice that\nactually wrote the opinion that is\n\n56\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.010\noften cited, but Katz versus United States\nis where we get this idea from.\n\n57\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.410\nAnd our ability to search and\nseize without a warrant\n\n58\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.390\nunder this circumstance is extended to\ncomputers, although computers at the time\n\n59\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.090\nwere not envisioned necessarily as\nbeing part of this conversation.\n\n60\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.960\nBut we do extend that thought\nprocess into the computer realm\n\n61\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.120\nwhen we think about investigations\nof a forensic nature.\n\n62\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.510\nNow, the next logical question would be,\n\n63\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.850\nwhat is that reasonable expectation of\nprivacy with regards to computers, right?\n\n64\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.530\nBecause we have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in our home.\n\n65\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.864\nWe have a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in our car, for\n\n66\n00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:58.607\ninstance, as an individual.\n\n67\n00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:02.600\nGoing on about our business,\nnot doing anything unusual.\n\n68\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.710\nThe law enforcement entity, the\ngovernment, cannot just kick down our door\n\n69\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.350\nand say, hey, we're gonna go through and\nsearch for this or that,\n\n70\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.050\nwhen we have no evidence of you doing\nanything and no reason to suspect you.\n\n71\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.040\nThere is protection under the law, and\n\n72\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.920\nwe do have a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in certain situations.\n\n73\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.348\nWe've talked about this, Daniel and I,\nin one of our last episodes, mentioned and\n\n74\n00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:25.521\nwent through the scenario.\n\n75\n00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:29.950\nFor instance, of an office worker who may\nor may not be having an expectation of\n\n76\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.936\nprivacy when they're operating on company\nequipment, they're making a phone call.\n\n77\n00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:38.474\nWe talked about thought process,\nwhere if I was making a phone call or\n\n78\n00:04:38.474 --> 00:04:42.317\nDaniel was making a phone call, and\nhe was able to or I was able to listen in,\n\n79\n00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:44.642\nto hear what was being\nsaid on the phone call.\n\n80\n00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:49.773\nBecause we were sitting one or two cubes\naway, five or ten feet in an open office,\n\n81\n00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:53.400\nand one of us was talking\na little loudly on the phone.\n\n82\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.680\nThere's no expectation of\nprivacy in that regard.\n\n83\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.890\nIn theory I'm not eavesdropping,\nI just happen to be within earshot,\n\n84\n00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.380\nand you were talking too loudly, so I was\nable to hear part of your conversation.\n\n85\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.615\nBut if I purposely tap the phone,\nand listen in surreptitiously,\n\n86\n00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:12.225\njust passively, but do so in a way\nthat clearly indicates that I'm doing\n\n87\n00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.643\nsomething that's not\nnormally sanctioned or done.\n\n88\n00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:19.871\nThen I probably am violating a law,\nI probably am violating,\n\n89\n00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.035\nI am violating his or\nmy reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n90\n00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:29.119\nBut in companies where there is\na clear policy that states that you\n\n91\n00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:34.395\nare not able to use company owned\nequipment for personal business.\n\n92\n00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:38.313\nWhere you're not supposed to call family\nmembers, significant others, kids,\n\n93\n00:05:38.313 --> 00:05:41.719\nwhatever, and have an expectation\nyou can have a private conversation\n\n94\n00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.269\nover the company phone system.\n\n95\n00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:46.703\nOr send emails of a private\nnature on the company email\n\n96\n00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:51.513\nsystem without potentially somebody\nobserving them, a copy being made,\n\n97\n00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:56.577\nthem being brought back up later and\ndiscussed with you, then caveat emptor.\n\n98\n00:05:56.577 --> 00:05:59.052\nIf you don't speak Latin, buyer beware.\n\n99\n00:05:59.052 --> 00:06:03.084\nYou now operate in the realm of\nhaving been told, hey, by the way,\n\n100\n00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:05.676\ndon't expect that you will have privacy.\n\n101\n00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:08.691\nWe're gonna be paying attention,\nwe're gonna record everything,\n\n102\n00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.400\nwe're gonna monitor everything.\n\n103\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.792\nWhether we make a copy or not,\n\n104\n00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:15.405\nwhether we use it to then come back to\nhave a conversation with you or not.\n\n105\n00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:20.100\nWhether we read it, and have knowledge of\nit, or not, is not your concern anymore.\n\n106\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.803\nCuz we've told you that if you\nchoose to engage in this behavior,\n\n107\n00:06:22.803 --> 00:06:24.144\nyou should assume that we will.\n\n108\n00:06:24.144 --> 00:06:28.599\nAnd if you then continue to, the fault\nis yours for expecting privacy where\n\n109\n00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.645\nwe've clearly demarcated a policy\nthat says, there will be none.\n\n110\n00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:35.283\nSo you wanna understand that and\nunderstand the logic of that,\n\n111\n00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:36.690\nbecause that's how we operate.\n\n112\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.175\nSo with regards to what is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, with regards\n\n113\n00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:45.942\nto computers as storage devices under the\ndirect control of an owner or an entity.\n\n114\n00:06:45.942 --> 00:06:49.762\nCourts have interpreted the US\nConstitution's Fourth Amendment to apply\n\n115\n00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:54.017\ncomputers, as what we would call a closed\ncontainer, we need air quotes for this.\n\n116\n00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:58.692\nClosed container, the closed container\nconcept means, that as a result,\n\n117\n00:06:58.692 --> 00:07:02.429\naccess to the information is\nseen as opening the container.\n\n118\n00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:07.214\nAnd so, we have to understand that, the we\nsee a hard drive, we see a storage medium,\n\n119\n00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:11.137\nas a closed entity that is given\na reasonable expectation of privacy,\n\n120\n00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:12.549\nin certain situations.\n\n121\n00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:15.532\nAnd opening the container\ninvolves reaching in and\n\n122\n00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:19.357\ntaking information out, and\ntherefore violating that policy.\n\n123\n00:07:19.357 --> 00:07:22.328\nDepending on, again, the policy or\nthe expectation, rather,\n\n124\n00:07:22.328 --> 00:07:23.902\ndepending on the policy in place.\n\n125\n00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:28.663\nSo in a business environment, where you're\nworking on a corporate owned asset,\n\n126\n00:07:28.663 --> 00:07:33.493\nlike a desktop, a laptop, a device that\nis owned clearly by the cooperate entity,\n\n127\n00:07:33.493 --> 00:07:37.633\nmanaged by them, overseen by them,\nfurnished and provided by them and\n\n128\n00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:38.892\nmaintained by them.\n\n129\n00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:42.999\nThere is no expectation of privacy for\nthe data on that drive.\n\n130\n00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:45.715\nWe would go to the owner of that system,\nthe business,\n\n131\n00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.912\nif we're going a forensic investigation.\n\n132\n00:07:47.912 --> 00:07:52.067\nAnd as long as a duly appointed\nrepresentative of the company said, yes,\n\n133\n00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:55.886\nyou have rights to do that, go ahead and\nexamine the drive We would as\n\n134\n00:07:55.886 --> 00:08:00.175\ninvestigators, be well within our right\nand not violate any expectation of\n\n135\n00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:04.280\nprivacy, any law by then going and\ninvestigating the data on the drive.\n\n136\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.830\nAnd if we found evidence of whatever you\nwere doing or not doing or whatever,\n\n137\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.350\nwe would then be able to use that\nevidence to further the investigation.\n\n138\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.890\nBut if this is your private home\ncomputer that you own, has never touched\n\n139\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.590\nthe corporate network, and has no business\nbeing maintained by corporate entities,\n\n140\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.850\nthat's a different story.\n\n141\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.520\nBecause the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy is you\n\n142\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.490\nhave control over that device.\n\n143\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.690\nAnd as a result you would have to give us\npermission in order to search that device.\n\n144\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.870\nIf you don't,\nthen we will have an issue, right?\n\n145\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.180\nPotentially because we\nwill be violating the law.\n\n146\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.140\nSo reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe control or reasonable expectation\n\n147\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.920\nof privacy for devices, storage device,\nin the control of a third party means\n\n148\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.040\nthe third party gets the ability to be\nable to say yes or no as I was suggesting.\n\n149\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.710\nThe owner of the company can say yeah,\n\n150\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.430\ngo search Daniel's laptop,\nit's a business laptop.\n\n151\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.950\nDoesn't matter what he thinks about that,\ndoesn't matter if he wants us to or not.\n\n152\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.730\nWe have the right to because\nthis is not belongs to him,\n\n153\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.600\nit belongs to us essentially.\n\n154\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.570\nBut if it is something we owned,\na private search as we classify this as.\n\n155\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.040\nThe Fourth Amendment does not apply to\nsearches conducted by private parties,\n\n156\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.370\nmeaning if an unlicensed non\nlaw enforcement representative\n\n157\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.130\njust comes along and says hey,\nI'm a private citizen, I wanna search.\n\n158\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.380\nThen, if we're not acting as\na representative of a government entity,\n\n159\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.560\nin other words, we're not law enforcement,\nwe're not a government officer,\n\n160\n00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.110\nwe're a private citizen,\nwhole different concept, right?\n\n161\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.629\nBecause if we are just one person looking\nat another machine, we're not violating\n\n162\n00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.696\nthe Fourth Amendment, because we're\nnot a law enforcement official or\n\n163\n00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:43.466\ngovernment official in the first place.\n\n164\n00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:45.145\nWe're not bound by that in other words.\n\n165\n00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:47.737\nSo it does not apply\nto private searches or\n\n166\n00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:52.256\nthird party private citizens searches\nconducted outside of the realm of\n\n167\n00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:57.280\nthe business, outside of the realm of\nlaw enforcement or the government.\n\n168\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.900\nIf you're not acting as an agent of the\ngovernment, you're not bound by that law.\n\n169\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.280\nThat's not to say that it's right or\n\n170\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.160\nwrong to search someone's private\nstuff without their permission.\n\n171\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.180\nI'm just pointing out that it's not\na Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy\n\n172\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.450\nconversation at that point,\nit's something very different.\n\n173\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Adam yeah, that makes me think so if\nlet's say I had a private investigator or\n\n174\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:21.250\nprivate forensics investigator who\nobtained information from a computer or\n\n175\n00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.945\nthrough whatever means.\n\n176\n00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:25.677\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Let's be\nclear about whatever means.\n\n177\n00:10:25.677 --> 00:10:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I do, I mean, whatever means,\nso they hacked into it.\n\n178\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.270\n&gt;&gt; No, no, what I'm saying is,\ndid they have, when I think, when somebody\n\n179\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.260\nsays to me, through whatever means,\nfirst thing I think is not methodology but\n\n180\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.120\nrather the framework\nthey're operating within.\n\n181\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.420\nIn other words, are they a duly higher,\nduly appointed,\n\n182\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.990\nduly engaged representative of\nthe business that owns the equipment?\n\n183\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.620\nIn which case, there's absolutely,\nas we said, no issue here.\n\n184\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.360\nThey're allowed whatever they have to do.\n\n185\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.080\nThere's no question about hey,\nyou broke this law.\n\n186\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.240\nYou violated this expectation.\n\n187\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.430\nYou're employed by the company,\ncompany owns the asset.\n\n188\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.390\nEnd of conversation.\n\n189\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.843\n&gt;&gt; Got ya.\n&gt;&gt; As long as senior management is giving\n\n190\n00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:04.070\nyou authorization.\n\n191\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.947\n&gt;&gt; Right, authorization.\n\n192\n00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:08.835\n&gt;&gt; If you're just a random person that\nwalks up to a random computer not owned by\n\n193\n00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.990\nyou, right?\n\n194\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.060\nSo as an individual,\nif I walked up to your computer and\n\n195\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.580\nyou were sitting in Starbucks,\nyou got up, walked away.\n\n196\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.770\nI walked up and\nI started playing with your computer.\n\n197\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.630\nI found something.\n\n198\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, something illegal.\n\n199\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever it was.\nIt doesn't matter what it is,\n\n200\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.660\njust that I found anything,\nanything of interest.\n\n201\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.530\nI found your, I don't know bank account\ninformation, I found plans to go out and\n\n202\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.770\ntake over the world,\ndoesn't matter what it is.\n\n203\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.070\nBut as a private citizen not acting behalf\nof law enforcement, not acting on behalf\n\n204\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.670\nof the government and not acting on\nbehalf of let's say your employer.\n\n205\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.470\nI have not violated a law in terms of\nthe reasonable expectation of privacy and\n\n206\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.580\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n207\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.594\nI may have violated other laws.\n\n208\n00:11:45.594 --> 00:11:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But I didn't violate this issue or\n\n209\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.900\ncreate this issue around\nthe expectation of privacy.\n\n210\n00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.950\n&gt;&gt; And that moves into my question,\nwhich is, if you did that.\n\n211\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.150\nSay I left my computer at Starbucks open,\nyou walk over and\n\n212\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.110\nyou found child pornography, right?\n\n213\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.900\nNow you've found something illegal,\nis that admissible in court?\n\n214\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.800\n&gt;&gt; That's not the right approach.\n\n215\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.790\nNot quite sure whether it\nwould be admissible in court,\n\n216\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.040\nbecause we're jumping five steps\nahead of where we want to be.\n\n217\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The better way to ask that question,\n\n218\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.450\nto start that thought process is, what\nwould be my ability as the private citizen\n\n219\n00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.070\nthat found that, and my responsibility\nto then deal with that information?\n\n220\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.430\nIn other words,\ncould I go to law enforcement?\n\n221\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In the case of child pornography,\n\n222\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.100\nbecause it is clearly against many,\nmany laws, right.?\n\n223\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.390\n&gt;&gt; A violation yes, and should be.\n\n224\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.100\n&gt;&gt; Locally, nationally,\ninternationally, as well.\n\n225\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Do I have an expectation and\n\n226\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.340\nindeed an obligation,\nas a private citizen that finds this,\n\n227\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.140\nto report this to law enforcement?\n\n228\n00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then if I do, can law enforcement\n\n229\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.090\nthen come back under the guise of,\nin the framework of the Fourth Amendment,\n\n230\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.530\nright to search, search with or\nwithout a warrant.\n\n231\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.650\nSearch with or without knowledge of and\nadherence to, an expectation of privacy.\n\n232\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.640\nAll these questions.\n\n233\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.040\nCan they come in and\nvalidate the information?\n\n234\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.085\nAnd if they do so legally,\ncan they take that and\n\n235\n00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:04.030\ncan you wind up in a court of law?\n\n236\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.430\nThe answer down the road five, six or\nseven steps later would be yes,\n\n237\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.030\nassuming all that other stuff happened the\nright way, you may very well wind up in\n\n238\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.870\na court of law and that evidence may\nvery well be used to convict you.\n\n239\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.310\nBut, the first point of contact\nwould be if I found that or\n\n240\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.540\nsuspected, right, let's say\ntheoretically that you had that content.\n\n241\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.190\nDo I have an obligation, and\n\n242\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.950\ndo I have a need to be able to\nreport that to law enforcement?\n\n243\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.010\nThe answer is yes.\n\n244\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.020\nI should, whether I choose to or\nnot obviously is up to the individual.\n\n245\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.770\nBut if you see evidence of or\nsuspect evidence of in a compelling way.\n\n246\n00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.310\nI'm not saying, hey Daniel is one of those\npeople that jokes around all the time.\n\n247\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.760\nAnd although it's in poor taste and\n\n248\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.860\nshould never be done,\nhe made a joke about xy or z.\n\n249\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so, maybe as a result,\n\n250\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.615\nwhatever it is.\n\n251\n00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:52.210\nNon-specific, just joking about\nsomething that in normal cases\n\n252\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.080\nwould be considered probably not something\nyou would want to do or engage in.\n\n253\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.310\nBut if he clearly was making a joke,\n\n254\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.950\nprobably not a good idea\nto go report that, right?\n\n255\n00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n256\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.440\n&gt;&gt; Gonna get you in trouble,\ngonna get me in trouble.\n\n257\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.830\nAnd it's all gonna be a lot of nothing.\n\n258\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.450\n&gt;&gt; That's like false like Fox reporting.\n\n259\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Well it could be right,\n\n260\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.490\nI mean you know if I had a grudge\nagainst you I did it on purpose, clearly\n\n261\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.220\ndefamation, assassination of character,\nall of these things, libel, right?\n\n262\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.560\nCould come out of that,\nalthough they're very hard to prove.\n\n263\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.830\nBut it would cost a lot of concern for\nboth of us for no good reason.\n\n264\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, I've just heard of\nlike a, what's the word, evidence being\n\n265\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.790\nadmissible in the court, even if it\nwere obtained through illegal means.\n\n266\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.580\n&gt;&gt; So again, it's an interesting area, but\n\n267\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.038\nthere's a lot of, okay but\nstatements associated with that.\n\n268\n00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Got ya.\n&gt;&gt; Because when you're not acting on\n\n269\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.350\nbehalf of law enforcement, so in other\nwords, as private citizens, you and I.\n\n270\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:48.010\nWe operate with every different\nrestrictions or the ability to do things\n\n271\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.690\nthat a law enforcement representative or\na duly appointed representative of\n\n272\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.380\ngovernment entity that would have\nlaw enforcement capabilities, right?\n\n273\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.920\nThe Treasury Department and\nthe Secret Service.\n\n274\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.090\nThe FCC and their ability to be\nable to enforce broadcast laws and\n\n275\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:03.850\nthings like that.\n\n276\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.420\nThey have that thought process and\nthey operate in the mind of the court,\n\n277\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.350\nthe eye of the court that way because they\nare enforcing the law even though they may\n\n278\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.240\nnot be traditionally police officers.\n\n279\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.600\n&gt;&gt; But they are part of the government?\n\n280\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.890\n&gt;&gt; They're part of that apparatus.\n\n281\n00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.550\nSo from a regulatory, statutory compliance\nperspective, the health inspector is\n\n282\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.520\ninspecting and therefore enforcing certain\nlaws that the government has said,\n\n283\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.830\nlocal, federal,\nstate whatever are important, and\n\n284\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.480\nthey operate as a duly appointed\nrepresentative of that agency.\n\n285\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.100\nAnd although they're not a traditional law\nenforcement officer, as a police officer,\n\n286\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.510\nthey do have certain powers, and\n\n287\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.590\ntherefore under the law are seen as having\ncertain responsibilities in that category.\n\n288\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:45.902\nSo as a result, while they can't just\ncome into let's say a private home and\n\n289\n00:15:45.902 --> 00:15:50.393\ndo a health inspection without\nany kind of justifiable reason.\n\n290\n00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:54.127\nLike hey, we think you're running\nan illegal catering service and\n\n291\n00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.837\nrestaurant in your backyard.\n\n292\n00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:57.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody has reported,\n\n293\n00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:58.927\nyou were gonna show up and shuts you down.\n\n294\n00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:02.727\nYou cook a meal at home just minding\nyour own business for your family.\n\n295\n00:16:02.727 --> 00:16:04.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The Health Department has nothing to\n\n296\n00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:05.160\nsay about that.\n\n297\n00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.410\nThey're not gonna come to visit you.\n\n298\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.360\nIf they do you have no\nreason to let them in and\n\n299\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.450\nyou could take them to court if they\ndo because they're absolutely wrong.\n\n300\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But again if you're engaged in illegal\n\n301\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.950\nbehavior that violates legality,\nthat violates laws,\n\n302\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.210\nyou're running an unlicensed business and\nyou're making people sick.\n\n303\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They have the right to show up and\n\n304\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.870\nyou don't have an expectation of privacy.\n\n305\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.770\nAnd they're gonna come in and\nthey're gonna do whatever they have to do.\n\n306\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.745\nSo if evidence is gathered in\na way that a private citizen acts,\n\n307\n00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:32.250\nsomebody rats you out.\n\n308\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they over the fence,\n\n309\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.155\nyou got people standing in line paying for\nstuff and they make a phone call.\n\n310\n00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:39.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That tip, that evidence quote and\n\n311\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.040\nquote about that can be\nuse to then ultimately,\n\n312\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.860\npotentially open an investigation,\nprosecute you.\n\n313\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.200\nSo it's not that it was\nobtained illegally or legally,\n\n314\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.060\nI mean that is ultimately very important.\n\n315\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.580\nBut my point is, the private citizen\nacting that way is not acting illegally,\n\n316\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.890\nthey're simply, in theory,\n\n317\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.560\ndoing what we would hope most people\nwould do anywhere in the world.\n\n318\n00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.140\nWhich is if they saw something that\nthey felt was inappropriate, and\n\n319\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:09.090\nclearly violated a community norm,\na standard, ie a law of some kind that we\n\n320\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.585\nhave to follow in order to live well and\nto all get along together.\n\n321\n00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:15.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If that was the case, and\n\n322\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.120\nsomebody literally called you out and\ndropped a dime on you, as we say and\n\n323\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.340\nratted you out, if they did that,\nthat's not considered illegal evidence.\n\n324\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.921\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhen you're robbing people's' houses.\n\n325\n00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:28.460\nAnd you find they're [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, you find their stash right.\n\n327\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.380\n&gt;&gt; You'd be like this\nguy is a dope grower.\n\n328\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.040\n&gt;&gt; Should I report that, right.\n\n329\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:33.976\n&gt;&gt; Should I turn him in?\n\n330\n00:17:33.976 --> 00:17:34.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n331\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.640\nthat's kind of the ethical dilemma right.\n\n332\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.295\nSo clearly there are these\ncrazy scenarios.\n\n333\n00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:42.375\nBut all kidding aside,\nthere have been cases over the years,\n\n334\n00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.135\nwhere for a variety of reasons\nyou see this on these,\n\n335\n00:17:45.135 --> 00:17:47.590\nagain these movies,\nthese docudramas on TV sometimes.\n\n336\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.355\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Where somebody does,\n\n337\n00:17:49.355 --> 00:17:51.630\nthey are engaged in this illegal activity.\n\n338\n00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.100\nAnd then there was this\nClint Eastwood movie,\n\n339\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.380\nthe one where he's the cat burglar,\nbreaks in, finds, remember?\n\n340\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n341\n00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.545\n&gt;&gt; The president kills the woman,\nhe's in the room watching, and he has to-\n\n342\n00:18:01.545 --> 00:18:02.550\n&gt;&gt; Executive Power, is that what it is?\n\n343\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it was, right,\ncuz what's his name was the President.\n\n344\n00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.440\n&gt;&gt; Gene Hackman.\n\n345\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.068\n&gt;&gt; Gene Hackman was the President.\n\n346\n00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:11.650\nIt's great film, it's his daughter, right,\nis involved in that whole, not with\n\n347\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.240\nthe killing, but he has the daughter he's\nalways keeping an eye on in Washington.\n\n348\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.200\n&gt;&gt; It was really good.\n\n349\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.428\n&gt;&gt; So he breaks in, ultimately gets the\nPresident to fess up, because the husband,\n\n350\n00:18:20.428 --> 00:18:23.880\nright, ultimately is kind of\nthe mechanism that drives all that.\n\n351\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.564\nIn that kind of a situation,\nalthough it's crazy,\n\n352\n00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.802\nmay not actually be something\nthat happens on a regular basis.\n\n353\n00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:33.849\nBut there have been cases where Illegal\nactivities have led to the exposure of\n\n354\n00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:37.835\nsomething even worse and somebody has\nbeen compelled to say hey, you know,\n\n355\n00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:42.280\nI think this is a problem just morally,\nethically whatever and they reported that.\n\n356\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.470\nSo it could happen.\n\n357\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.850\nIt's not that you have necessarily\nan overwhelming need and\n\n358\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.170\nresponsibility under the law.\n\n359\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.310\nWe assume that people will act a certain\nway, and encourage you to do so.\n\n360\n00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.420\nBut if you see something and you don't\nreport it, how are we gonna know?\n\n361\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.120\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n362\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.860\n&gt;&gt; I mean you should.\n\n363\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.760\nBut how do we know?\n\n364\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.610\n&gt;&gt; It's a fascinating conversation,\nthat's for sure.\n\n365\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.880\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And it's very, very in depth.\n\n366\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.005\nObviously we're not gonna,\n\n367\n00:19:05.005 --> 00:19:07.397\nwe're having kind of a fun time\nexploring it a little bit here.\n\n368\n00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.\n\n369\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.510\n&gt;&gt; But really enjoying this conversation,\nbut we digress.\n\n370\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.810\nWhere should we continue?\n\n371\n00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo just to wrap this part up, so,\n\n372\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.440\nkeep in mind that although you're\nacting as a private citizen,\n\n373\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.880\nin the case that we're talking about.\n\n374\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.250\nAnd you're not acting on\nbehalf of the government,\n\n375\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.670\nthe fact that the person acts independent\nof the government doesn't always mean\n\n376\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.180\nthat a search will be\nclassified as private.\n\n377\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.010\nAgain, there may be additional\ncircumstances to consider.\n\n378\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.650\nAnd we may decide that that search is not\nlegal, like we were just talking about.\n\n379\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.360\nBecause maybe we could prove evidence of\nthe fact that you've got a running feud\n\n380\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.100\nwith this person.\n\n381\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.320\nYou did this to set them up and\nyou planted evidence, or who knows what.\n\n382\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.610\nThere's all these things that can go on.\n\n383\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.720\nSo we have to think about\nthe fact that normally\n\n384\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.810\nprivate citizens do operate\nslightly differently.\n\n385\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.111\nBut you know if the law\nenforcement came to me and said,\n\n386\n00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:54.870\nokay Daniel hey look we got this problem.\n\n387\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.390\nThe only way we gonna get around it\nyou know wink, wink, nod, nod, nudge,\n\n388\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.865\nnudge is if you pretend that we\nhaven't had this conversation.\n\n389\n00:20:01.865 --> 00:20:03.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you go over there and\n\n390\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.660\npick up that piece of paper, and\nsee what's written on the bottom of it.\n\n391\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.760\nAnd when it says plan to blow\nup the world, you come back and\n\n392\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.100\nshow it to us so we can go arrest Adam.\n\n393\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.720\n&gt;&gt; Right. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; If they do that,\nessentially they're entrapping me.\n\n394\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.030\nSo they're setting up\nbecause they're using you,\n\n395\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.070\nknowing that you can be used as a private\ncitizen and operate outside the very\n\n396\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.310\nnarrowly defined constricted rules that\nthe law enforcement entity has to follow.\n\n397\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.200\nBut without formally deputizing you,\n\n398\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.290\nwithout formally giving you a badge as\nsuch and saying, Dan you're now operating\n\n399\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.340\nas a law enforcement officer on our\nbehalf, a duly appointed representative.\n\n400\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.160\nThey essentially have done that,\nbut they haven't done it formally.\n\n401\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.480\nThey've co-opted you,\n\n402\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.420\nwhich means you should operate with the\nsame restrictions that they operate with.\n\n403\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.900\nBut they're kinda skirting that, and so\nthere's, you know, all these gray areas.\n\n404\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.663\n&gt;&gt; Also known as a confidential informant,\nright?\n\n405\n00:20:52.663 --> 00:20:54.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's differences there, right?\n\n406\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.220\nSo you see an undercover informant, or\na confidential informant depending on what\n\n407\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.490\nyou call them,\nvery different set of rules.\n\n408\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.510\nThere are rules, don't get me wrong,\nbut a very different set of rules that\n\n409\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.030\nultimately end up governing them,\nand that's really in criminal cases.\n\n410\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.200\nAlthough, it could be in any\nwe're talking about here, but\n\n411\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.650\nwould really be specific to\ncriminal cases, primarily.\n\n412\n00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.610\nHey, you're going undercover cuz\nsomebody's selling drugs, we turn you and\n\n413\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.360\nwe want you to, ultimately, buy from\nthem so we could then arrest them.\n\n414\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.120\nThat's gonna be handled very differently.\n\n415\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.332\nAnd then those things if you see them on\nTV and you seem them more realistic like\n\n416\n00:21:26.332 --> 00:21:32.260\nreal time shows as opposed to the made up\ndocudramas that where it's all Hollywood.\n\n417\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Not episode of Blue Bloods.\n\n418\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, like like you see that live TV\n\n419\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.830\nshow they have on that\nwhere the actually watch or\n\n420\n00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.790\nyou see real police departments operating\nin round the clock kind of thing.\n\n421\n00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:46.240\nIf you watch something like that and you\nlook at some of these episodes where they\n\n422\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.020\nmay be engaged in a sting operation or\nwhatever it is.\n\n423\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.222\nAnd you look at the way it's done.\n\n424\n00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:54.440\nThere are very specific boundaries\nthey have to be adhering to and\n\n425\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.440\nlaw enforcement to\noperate in a certain way.\n\n426\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.967\nThere is this idea of enticement and\nentrapment that has to be really clearly\n\n427\n00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:03.233\ndefined, even though you're using\nan undercover representative.\n\n428\n00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:07.567\nYou can't coerce a person that you're\ntrying to capture into creating and\n\n429\n00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:11.212\ncommitting a bad act and\nessentially push them over the line and\n\n430\n00:22:11.212 --> 00:22:13.770\nthen turn around hold them responsible.\n\n431\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.860\n&gt;&gt; That was kind of the big backlash\nwith honeypots and honeynets, right?\n\n432\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.545\nWas they were being seen as enticement or\n\n433\n00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:23.504\nentrapment of some sort\n&gt;&gt; The question, the debate was where\n\n434\n00:22:23.504 --> 00:22:25.900\nthey enticement verses entrapment\n&gt;&gt; All right\n\n435\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.820\n&gt;&gt; Mechanisms and\n\n436\n00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.210\nit was not clear and so\nthere was a running debate for\n\n437\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.510\na while because the courts had really\nruled on this, ultimately there\n\n438\n00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.620\nback in favour we use them we've\ntalked about them in prior episodes.\n\n439\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.670\nAnd they're seen as enticement devices\nas opposed to entrapment devices or\n\n440\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.210\nat least they are thought of in vision\nkind of analyzed under that framework.\n\n441\n00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.540\nMeaning they are permissible, they can be\nused, you're tempting somebody giving them\n\n442\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.810\nthe opportunity to make a good or\na bad decision.\n\n443\n00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.013\nBut if they make a bad decision,\nthat's because they chose to do it, not\n\n444\n00:22:55.013 --> 00:22:58.549\nbecause you coerced and forced them into\ndoing it and left them no alternative.\n\n445\n00:22:58.549 --> 00:23:02.938\nBut entrapment is illegal, so\nwhen you are undercover doing something,\n\n446\n00:23:02.938 --> 00:23:07.557\nif you coerce somebody to commit a bad\nact, that cannot be held against them.\n\n447\n00:23:07.557 --> 00:23:10.651\nBecause you essentially almost\nlike literally the court says,\n\n448\n00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:14.600\nputting a gun to their head proverbially,\nforcing them to do it doesn't mean they\n\n449\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.610\nwould have acted that way if\nyou were not coercing them.\n\n450\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.830\nIt quite probably means they\nmay not have acted that way.\n\n451\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; More often than not.\n\n452\n00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.660\nSo as a result we can't\nhold them accountable for\n\n453\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.440\nsomething you forced them to do.\n\n454\n00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.100\nWe can hold you accountable,\nwe're not going to accept the evidence and\n\n455\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.070\nthey get to go free and you may be\nsanctioned, but you can't do that.\n\n456\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.320\nSo there are specific\nrules of engagement right?\n\n457\n00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.760\nEven there and\nwe have to really think about that.\n\n458\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.000\nIt's not as sexy and cool and exciting as\nwe make it out to be in the movies and TV.\n\n459\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.850\nIt's kind of boring,\nbland, mundane everyday.\n\n460\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.300\nKnow where you are at all\ntimes against that line,\n\n461\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.300\nclearly demarcated kind of stuff.\n\n462\n00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.361\nVery important as investigators to\nknow this because if we operate in\n\n463\n00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:54.166\nthe wrong way, with the wrong mindset.\n\n464\n00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:58.492\nWe wind up, unfortunately, as we've\ntalked about in prior conversation,\n\n465\n00:23:58.492 --> 00:24:01.886\nshooting ourselves in the foot and\nnegating, nullifying,\n\n466\n00:24:01.886 --> 00:24:04.164\nany evidence of any wrongdoing we find.\n\n467\n00:24:04.164 --> 00:24:09.122\nAnd remember, that's usually the idea that\nbutterfly factor the propagation out from\n\n468\n00:24:09.122 --> 00:24:12.930\nthat drop of that stone and\nall the waves that go out in the water.\n\n469\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:17.177\nWe may taint lots of other evidence in\nother areas that normally, would have been\n\n470\n00:24:17.177 --> 00:24:21.236\naccessible and imitable and therefore\nusable by us, but because the taint of\n\n471\n00:24:21.236 --> 00:24:25.420\nthis one act led to a cascading change to\nus being able to say no, that evidence is\n\n472\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.185\ntraced back to this event,\nthat evidence may no longer be valid.\n\n473\n00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:32.570\nAnd we could literally ruin\nan entire investigation,\n\n474\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.450\nruin all that hard work of multiple\npeople and parties, time and\n\n475\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.740\nmoney invested by engaging\nthese activities.\n\n476\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.352\nIt could be very big problem for us.\n\n477\n00:24:40.352 --> 00:24:43.836\nSo it is a very critical part of\nthe conversation that we engage very,\n\n478\n00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:45.030\nvery important.\n\n479\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.854\nSo use of technology\nto obtain information.\n\n480\n00:24:46.854 --> 00:24:50.676\nThe idea of use in what we call,\ninnovative technology by the government or\n\n481\n00:24:50.676 --> 00:24:54.802\nits agents, may require a warrant meaning\nthings like digitally wire tapping,\n\n482\n00:24:54.802 --> 00:24:58.808\nmost likely requires a warrant because\nyou're getting into the use of this new\n\n483\n00:24:58.808 --> 00:25:02.290\ntechnology, and\nwe have to get permission to do that.\n\n484\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.470\nUse of wireless monitoring or\n\n485\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:10.060\nthird party monitoring through the Cloud,\nright, may require the use of a warrant\n\n486\n00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.940\nbecause again this is what we\nwould call innovative technology.\n\n487\n00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.764\nThe key criteria assessed\nhere is whether or\n\n488\n00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:17.289\nnot the technology is available\nto general public, right?\n\n489\n00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:20.957\nSo if the general public cannot use\nwire tapping technology to listen to\n\n490\n00:25:20.957 --> 00:25:24.320\nconversations Then the ruling is that,\nthe government or the law\n\n491\n00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.860\nenforcement entity would need a warrant\nin order to engage in that behavior.\n\n492\n00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.440\nIf everybody have the ability to\n\n493\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.520\nlook at cloud-based data as it\ntransits over the Internet and\n\n494\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.170\nread it regardless of encryption,\nthen you wouldn't need a warrant to do it.\n\n495\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:42.450\nBut because we don't, because we\nneed special tools, extra access and\n\n496\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.520\nall sorts of bells and whistles,\nthen we need a warrant to do that, and\n\n497\n00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.340\nthat's the standard that we use.\n\n498\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.820\nSo it's very important for\nus to be aware of this as well.\n\n499\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.620\nAre there exceptions to\nthe warrant requirement?\n\n500\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.810\nAs I've talked about, absolutely.\n\n501\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.860\nI've talked about things like consent,\ntalked about exigent circumstances,\n\n502\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.850\nimmediate threat of bodily harm or\ndeath, things like that.\n\n503\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.931\nYou hear somebody struggling, yelling,\ncreaming for help, you walk in.\n\n504\n00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:08.884\nAnd there is drug paraphernalia\nall over the table and\n\n505\n00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:13.170\nsomebody is holding a gun on someone's\nhead threatening to shoot them.\n\n506\n00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.746\nAs a law enforcement officer,\nyour first responsibility,\n\n507\n00:26:15.746 --> 00:26:17.412\nis to safe guard that person's life and\n\n508\n00:26:17.412 --> 00:26:20.454\nnot worried about getting a warrant\nto deal with the drugs on the table.\n\n509\n00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:24.029\nAnd by the way, since you came in\nunder the concept of helping them,\n\n510\n00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:27.857\nafter this is all said and done,\nassuming that the person holding the gun\n\n511\n00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:31.180\nto the person's head is not\ndead because you shoot them.\n\n512\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.832\nThey could be taken to jail for\nthreatening somebody, but\n\n513\n00:26:33.832 --> 00:26:37.660\nalso for the drug paraphernalia and\ndrugs on the table, because you found it\n\n514\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.420\nwhile you were engaged in\nan incident circumstance search,\n\n515\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.860\nmeaning you didn't know it was there,\nyou had no way to know it was there.\n\n516\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.500\nTherefore you had no expectation\nin the eyes of the law\n\n517\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.990\nthat you would need to ask for\na warrant to find it.\n\n518\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.076\nIt was just circumstantial to what you\nwere doing, but because it was there, and\n\n519\n00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:56.339\nyou found it as part of the other\nactivity, we would allowed it.\n\n520\n00:26:56.339 --> 00:27:00.280\nSo again,\ncircumstances are always variable, right?\n\n521\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; There is a million other things that\n\n522\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.640\nhave to happen in that scenario for\nall of that to be considered legal, but\n\n523\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.690\nthe broad thought process we're talking\nabout is, you wouldn't stop and\n\n524\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.350\nget a warrant because you think there's\ndrugs in there before somebody gets shot\n\n525\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.540\nYou would help the person and\ndeal with everything else after the fact.\n\n526\n00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.874\nSearches are a result of a lawful arrest.\n\n527\n00:27:17.874 --> 00:27:22.699\nA law enforcement officer pulls you over\non the side of the road, arrests you for\n\n528\n00:27:22.699 --> 00:27:24.932\ndrunk driving, searches your car,\n\n529\n00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:29.410\nfinds an unlicensed firearm hidden\nunder the front seat, guess what?\n\n530\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.340\nThat firearm is evidence against you,\n\n531\n00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.150\nbecause it's part of a search\nafter a lawful arrest.\n\n532\n00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.640\nThey pat you down after\nthey arrest you and\n\n533\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.445\nthey find plutonium in your back pocket.\n\n534\n00:27:38.445 --> 00:27:39.672\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; Shame on you by the way.\n\n535\n00:27:39.672 --> 00:27:40.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n536\n00:27:40.196 --> 00:27:41.850\ncarrying your plutonium after hours.\n\n537\n00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.695\n&gt;&gt; All right, knew better.\n\n538\n00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:43.930\n&gt;&gt; They can use that against you, right?\n\n539\n00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:44.920\nThey could do that, right?\n\n540\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.840\nSo again, you're lawfully arrested.\n\n541\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.770\nAt that point, we could search\nyou without having a warrant,\n\n542\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.500\nbecause we're finding information out\nafter the fact we've arrested you.\n\n543\n00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.930\nWe're searching you to just discover what\nelse is going on and document everything.\n\n544\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.640\nInventory searches, border searches,\n\n545\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.230\ninternational issues, these kinds\nof things don't require a warrant.\n\n546\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.620\nIn other words, at the border,\nyou're going through a border, and you've\n\n547\n00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.930\nconsented by crossing that border to being\nsearched, whether you realize it or not.\n\n548\n00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.690\nYou go, you fly into another country,\nor out of one country to another.\n\n549\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.590\nYou're crossing one or more borders.\n\n550\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:23.390\nYou go through passport control,\nwhatever it may be called,\n\n551\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.910\nborder control, there's different\nnames for it depending where you go.\n\n552\n00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.900\nBut you're essentially gonna\ntransit into that country.\n\n553\n00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.730\nEither via plane, boat,\ntrain, who know's what.\n\n554\n00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.132\nAs long as you're not walking across\nthe border trying to hide and\n\n555\n00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.454\nsneak in where nobody is watching.\n\n556\n00:28:36.454 --> 00:28:40.151\nIf you're coming in legally, right,\nmeaning you're using a normally accepted\n\n557\n00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:43.740\nmethod of transportation across\nan internationally declared frontier.\n\n558\n00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.070\nAnd, subjecting yourself to the laws,\nand therefore the requirements of entry,\n\n559\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.350\nyou're gonna be at least\nquestioned at a minimum, and\n\n560\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.810\nyou're very likely gonna be searched.\n\n561\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.355\nYour luggage may be opened up,\nyour car may be searched, you may be asked\n\n562\n00:28:54.355 --> 00:28:57.353\nquestions about where you came from,\nwhere you're going to, what you're doing.\n\n563\n00:28:57.353 --> 00:29:00.867\nYour credentials will be checked,\nyour passport, your driver's license,\n\n564\n00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:01.780\nwhatever, right?\n\n565\n00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.450\nAll that stuff is part of that.\n\n566\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.660\nBy international treaty among many many\ncountries, and by law in every country.\n\n567\n00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.720\nSo you are consenting to these things.\n\n568\n00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.870\nSo again keep that in mind and\nunderstand that, right?\n\n569\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.760\nSo what we have to think about then\nis what we would call the scope of\n\n570\n00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.290\nconsent, right?\n\n571\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.340\nWhat is the scope of consent?\n\n572\n00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.360\nWhat's third party consent?\n\n573\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.760\nWhat's implied consent?\n\n574\n00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.535\nWe have to talk about this.\n\n575\n00:29:21.535 --> 00:29:26.338\nThe scope of consent to a search is\ngenerally defined by its expressed object,\n\n576\n00:29:26.338 --> 00:29:30.580\ndirectly quoting here from another\ncase United States versus Pena.\n\n577\n00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.661\nExpressed object, and it's limited by the\nbreadth of the consent given according to\n\n578\n00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:39.369\nUnited States Tenth Circuit\naccord in 1998.\n\n579\n00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:43.895\nSo the idea here is that ultimately\nthe standard for measuring the scope of\n\n580\n00:29:43.895 --> 00:29:48.070\nconsent under the Fourth Amendment\nis objective reasonableness.\n\n581\n00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.650\nWe've talked about this already.\n\n582\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.320\nWhat would the typical reasonable person,\n\n583\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.090\nwe'll call this a reasonable\nperson statute.\n\n584\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.017\nWhat would the reasonable person have\nunderstood by the exchange between\n\n585\n00:29:58.017 --> 00:30:00.812\nthe agent and\nthe person granting consent, right?\n\n586\n00:30:00.812 --> 00:30:03.976\nSo in other words, if we're talking and\nyou're back and forth,\n\n587\n00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:08.130\nwe kind of have an understanding that I've\nsaid yes, you can search or no you cannot.\n\n588\n00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.397\nWhat would the reasonable\nperson understand about that?\n\n589\n00:30:10.397 --> 00:30:13.939\nYou often see this again on\nTV sometimes in whatever.\n\n590\n00:30:13.939 --> 00:30:16.575\nWe don't have a warrant, right?\n\n591\n00:30:16.575 --> 00:30:18.090\nWe can stand here and wait for one or\n\n592\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.242\nyou could give us permission to come in,\nright?\n\n593\n00:30:20.242 --> 00:30:20.983\nYou see that a lot.\n\n594\n00:30:20.983 --> 00:30:22.293\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like the police will say hey,\n\n595\n00:30:22.293 --> 00:30:25.240\nwe don't have the legal right to step\nacross that threshold right now.\n\n596\n00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.020\nBut we're just gonna sit here, and\n\n597\n00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.530\nessentially sit on top of you until\nsomebody brings us that search warrant.\n\n598\n00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.380\nOr, you can make this easier for\neverybody.\n\n599\n00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.680\nYou could just let us in right now and\ngive us consent to search,\n\n600\n00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.370\nbecause we don't have\na court's permission.\n\n601\n00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.770\nBut as the owner,\nyou could give us consent, and\n\n602\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.860\nare you willing to do that, right?\n\n603\n00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.410\nAnd if you say yes,\nthey could search anywhere they want.\n\n604\n00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.280\nYou could say look,\nI'm gonna give you consent to search, but\n\n605\n00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.270\nonly to search this particular area,\nall other areas are off-limits.\n\n606\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.666\nYou don't see that very [LAUGH] often,\nright?\n\n607\n00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:55.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm going to give you consent, but\n\n608\n00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:57.345\nas the landlord,\nas the owner, as whatever,\n\n609\n00:30:57.345 --> 00:30:59.360\nI'm only gonna give you\nconsent to search the kitchen.\n\n610\n00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.070\nYou cannot search anywhere else.\n\n611\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.000\nNow, keep in mind because of\nthe plain view statute, right?\n\n612\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.389\nIf we walk in and we see three guns\nsitting on a table in plain view,\n\n613\n00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:09.732\neven though we're on\nour way to the kitchen,\n\n614\n00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:12.508\na law enforcement official\ncould then walk it over and\n\n615\n00:31:12.508 --> 00:31:17.036\nengage, right, in a search over examine\nthose guns because they're in plain sight.\n\n616\n00:31:17.036 --> 00:31:21.358\nSo, again it's really hard for somebody\nto keep all this straight in their head.\n\n617\n00:31:21.358 --> 00:31:24.100\nBut you gotta understand that there's\nall these unique ways that this stuff\n\n618\n00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.850\ncombines, right?\n\n619\n00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.857\nAnd as a result,\nwe have to understand that, right?\n\n620\n00:31:27.857 --> 00:31:31.514\nSo the scope of the search is ultimately\ndependent on the facts of the case,\n\n621\n00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:32.860\nis what we would say.\n\n622\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.970\nIf we have reason to believe,\nthat we have to search the kitchen and\n\n623\n00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.590\nwe should not really worry\nabout anything else,\n\n624\n00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.558\nthat's what we're gonna focus on in\nour application for a search warrant.\n\n625\n00:31:42.558 --> 00:31:45.615\nIf we have reason to believe we\nhave to search the entire domicile,\n\n626\n00:31:45.615 --> 00:31:48.189\nthe entire home or office,\nwe're gonna focus on that.\n\n627\n00:31:48.189 --> 00:31:51.319\nAnd you see this sometimes, where\nsearch warrants are narrowly defined,\n\n628\n00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:52.120\nyou see this a lot.\n\n629\n00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.327\nSearch warrants are narrowly defined.\n\n630\n00:31:53.327 --> 00:31:57.488\nHey, you're gonna be able to search\nthis address and these items.\n\n631\n00:31:57.488 --> 00:31:59.638\nYou see this on TV and\nmovies sometimes as well.\n\n632\n00:31:59.638 --> 00:32:01.925\nHey, you searched beyond this.\n\n633\n00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:05.088\nYou didn't search this area,\nor you searched this area but\n\n634\n00:32:05.088 --> 00:32:06.740\nit wasn't connected to this.\n\n635\n00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.060\nIt was a disconnected,\nstand-alone house or something.\n\n636\n00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.656\nYou know how sometimes,\nyou have houses that have,\n\n637\n00:32:11.656 --> 00:32:13.432\nthey're used to be called\nmother-in-law quarters, or\n\n638\n00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:14.700\nyou have the back-houses, whatever.\n\n639\n00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.226\nIf they have a separate address, they're\nnot the same as the front house, but\n\n640\n00:32:19.226 --> 00:32:20.194\na separate one.\n\n641\n00:32:20.194 --> 00:32:23.281\nAnd you have a search warrant for\nthe front property, and\n\n642\n00:32:23.281 --> 00:32:26.780\nnot the back one because it's\na separate addressed entity.\n\n643\n00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.850\nAnd you search both, you have violated,\nor run over, the extent of that warrant.\n\n644\n00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.456\nAnything you find in that other domicile,\nthat other property in the back,\n\n645\n00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:35.900\nis not admissible,\nbecause it was an illegal search.\n\n646\n00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.696\nSee here, there's all these crazy\nthings that can happen as a result,\n\n647\n00:32:38.696 --> 00:32:39.821\nwe have to understand that.\n\n648\n00:32:39.821 --> 00:32:41.994\nWe've talked about 3rd party consent,\n\n649\n00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:45.520\ndifferent categories about\nthird party consent in general.\n\n650\n00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.461\nAny user of a computer under their\nauthority may permit a search.\n\n651\n00:32:48.461 --> 00:32:51.170\nMeaning, if I go and\nI am the user of this computer, or\n\n652\n00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.822\nDaniel gives me permission\nto use his computer, and\n\n653\n00:32:53.822 --> 00:32:57.840\nthen somebody comes over to me and\nsays, hey, can I search that computer?\n\n654\n00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.640\nBecause you gave me\nthe right to use yours,\n\n655\n00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.896\nI could then give somebody the right\nto search it, without your permission.\n\n656\n00:33:02.896 --> 00:33:04.150\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting to know.\n\n657\n00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.909\n&gt;&gt; That would suck in a big way, right?\n\n658\n00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:07.008\nThink about that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big time, big time.\n\n659\n00:33:07.008 --> 00:33:11.428\n&gt;&gt; Because if you didn't want me to do\nthat, but yet I was the quote-unquote,\n\n660\n00:33:11.428 --> 00:33:14.960\nauthorized user,\nat the time that somebody showed up.\n\n661\n00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.435\nYou've ceded your right to me, and did not\ntell me, hey, don't let anybody search.\n\n662\n00:33:19.435 --> 00:33:22.843\nThen I actually can give them a right\nto do that, believe it or not.\n\n663\n00:33:22.843 --> 00:33:24.075\n&gt;&gt; That's a little disturbing.\n\n664\n00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:25.187\n&gt;&gt; That is incredibly disturbing.\n\n665\n00:33:25.187 --> 00:33:26.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is also how that works.\n\n666\n00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:29.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Parental consent, if you're under 18,\n\n667\n00:33:29.088 --> 00:33:30.038\nhey, guess what?\n\n668\n00:33:30.038 --> 00:33:31.151\nYou better not piss your parents off.\n\n669\n00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:33.969\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if you do, boy, they got it in for\n\n670\n00:33:33.969 --> 00:33:34.748\nyou, right?\n\n671\n00:33:34.748 --> 00:33:38.098\nUnder 18, parental consent is allowed,\nagain, this is the United States,\n\n672\n00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:39.755\nvaries by country, around the world.\n\n673\n00:33:39.755 --> 00:33:43.280\nThe law of consent, rather,\nthe legal age of consent will vary greatly\n\n674\n00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.053\nin certain countries, so\nyou have to understand that.\n\n675\n00:33:46.053 --> 00:33:50.736\nBut in the US, under 18, you're considered\na minor, and your parents have the right\n\n676\n00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:53.535\nto give consent for\nyour belongings to be searched.\n\n677\n00:33:53.535 --> 00:33:55.212\nYour room, whatever,\nyour car, whatever it is.\n\n678\n00:33:55.212 --> 00:33:58.910\nOver 18, highly dependent on the facts and\ncircumstances.\n\n679\n00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.619\nSpouses and/or domestic partners,\neither may consent.\n\n680\n00:34:02.619 --> 00:34:06.950\nMeaning, if your wife, your husband,\nyour domestic partner, your girlfriend,\n\n681\n00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.423\nboyfriend, whoever it is.\n\n682\n00:34:08.423 --> 00:34:11.964\nIf they are part of that relationship\nwith you, they can consent.\n\n683\n00:34:11.964 --> 00:34:15.077\nIf you're not home and they are,\nyeah, you can come in and search, or\n\n684\n00:34:15.077 --> 00:34:17.086\nno you can't, they're allowed either way.\n\n685\n00:34:17.086 --> 00:34:20.783\nSystem administrators, they typically,\nkind of interesting thought process.\n\n686\n00:34:20.783 --> 00:34:24.503\nService agents of the providers of\nelectronic communication services,\n\n687\n00:34:24.503 --> 00:34:27.820\nunder ECPA,\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n\n688\n00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.923\nAnd as a result, they actually\nare allowed to give consent for searches.\n\n689\n00:34:31.923 --> 00:34:36.110\nSo system administrators, this is how\nwe get in the systems in a business.\n\n690\n00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.909\nSystems administrators or, again,\na duly appointed representative of\n\n691\n00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.967\nthe senior leadership of that entity,\ncan give rights for a search to happen.\n\n692\n00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:46.725\nThey can essentially say, yeah,\nDaniel's the director of IT,\n\n693\n00:34:46.725 --> 00:34:49.520\nyou could search out of his computer,\nit's a corporate owned asset.\n\n694\n00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.549\nNo problem, and he or his elected or\n\n695\n00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:54.805\nduly appointed representative\nhas the right to do that.\n\n696\n00:34:54.805 --> 00:34:58.336\nThe Help Desk has the right to go in and\nsupport your machine, because they're\n\n697\n00:34:58.336 --> 00:35:01.920\nworking on behalf of the government,\n[LAUGH] on behalf the entity, right?\n\n698\n00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.371\nWe also have implied consent,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n699\n00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:07.218\nIndividuals often enter into agreements,\nas we've talked about,\n\n700\n00:35:07.218 --> 00:35:08.700\nthat give the right for searching.\n\n701\n00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.974\nIf you rent, let's say, a storage space\nin one of these big storage facilities.\n\n702\n00:35:15.974 --> 00:35:19.544\nYou are implying that you have certain\nrights under the agreement, but\n\n703\n00:35:19.544 --> 00:35:22.012\nalso the entity that owns\nit has certain rights.\n\n704\n00:35:22.012 --> 00:35:24.940\nAnd if law enforcement shows\nup a search warrant, and says,\n\n705\n00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.893\nwe want in to locker five, or whatever.\n\n706\n00:35:26.893 --> 00:35:29.556\nThey don't have to notify you,\nthey just have to go break the lock,\n\n707\n00:35:29.556 --> 00:35:31.403\nassuming that the search\nwarrant is in order.\n\n708\n00:35:31.403 --> 00:35:34.254\nBecause you've given them\nthe right to be able to do that,\n\n709\n00:35:34.254 --> 00:35:35.790\nwhen you signed the contract.\n\n710\n00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.520\nThey have the right to be\nable to act in that respect.\n\n711\n00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.096\nWe've talked about exigent circumstances.\n\n712\n00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:43.465\nElectronic data is considered\nperishable and, as a result,\n\n713\n00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:45.530\nexigent circumstances apply.\n\n714\n00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.602\nWe can act to safeguard that\ndata as a forensic investigator,\n\n715\n00:35:48.602 --> 00:35:51.214\nif we feel that there is\nimminent threat to the data.\n\n716\n00:35:51.214 --> 00:35:54.239\nSomebody's about to turn\nthe power off on that machine,\n\n717\n00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:56.200\nwe can act to stop them, right?\n\n718\n00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.825\nThis is why if you've ever seen one of\nthese raids take place where government\n\n719\n00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:00.735\nentities show up.\n\n720\n00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:06.305\nLaw enforcement entities, Secret Service,\nwhoever it may be, the IRS.\n\n721\n00:36:06.305 --> 00:36:08.960\nIf they show up to raid a business,\nthey will come in.\n\n722\n00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.680\nThey have the windbreakers on,\nfully identified, they have guns.\n\n723\n00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.088\nLots of them, and\nthey show up with guns out.\n\n724\n00:36:15.088 --> 00:36:18.770\nAnd they will yell and scream until\nyou back away from the computer.\n\n725\n00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.150\nAnd if you make a move, they will shoot\nyou first and then worry about it later.\n\n726\n00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.738\nBecause under the concept\nof exigent circumstance,\n\n727\n00:36:25.738 --> 00:36:27.411\nif that machine is booby trapped.\n\n728\n00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:29.869\nWhich it very well may be,\nif you're hiding something and\n\n729\n00:36:29.869 --> 00:36:32.580\nthey have enough evidence that\nthey think you're up to no good,\n\n730\n00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.015\nthat they're coming with 25 of\ntheir friends to come visit you?\n\n731\n00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:37.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If that's the case,\n\n732\n00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.768\nthey are gonna assume that you're\ngonna try to blow the evidence up, or\n\n733\n00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:42.120\nsomehow modify it.\n\n734\n00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.962\nAnd they have the ability to act\nto safeguard that evidence, and\n\n735\n00:36:45.962 --> 00:36:47.963\nif you don't comply, trust me.\n\n736\n00:36:47.963 --> 00:36:50.425\nThey will shoot you first and\nworry about where you fall later.\n\n737\n00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:54.750\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But that's how it works, so\n\n738\n00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.015\nwe need to understand that.\n\n739\n00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:58.423\nDegree of urgency,\namount of time to obtain a warrant,\n\n740\n00:36:58.423 --> 00:37:00.180\nwill evidence be removed or destroyed.\n\n741\n00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.737\nAre the key defining characteristics\nwith regards to exigent circumstance, so\n\n742\n00:37:03.737 --> 00:37:04.949\nwe need to be aware of that.\n\n743\n00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:08.204\nAnd finally,\nwe talked about the plain view concept and\n\n744\n00:37:08.204 --> 00:37:10.880\nthe exception around plain view.\n\n745\n00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.337\nEvidence in plain view may be\nseized with or without a warrant.\n\n746\n00:37:14.337 --> 00:37:16.821\nExcuse me, without a warrant,\nexcuse me, but\n\n747\n00:37:16.821 --> 00:37:19.440\ncomputer files that\nare seized may not be opened.\n\n748\n00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.650\nThis is kind of interesting.\n\n749\n00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.340\nAgain, we're talking\nspecifically about computers.\n\n750\n00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.812\nWe could seize the evidence, but we can't\nlook at the files and examine them,\n\n751\n00:37:26.812 --> 00:37:28.810\nunless we're already authorized to do so.\n\n752\n00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.940\nSo what will often happen is,\nwe will seize a computer in plain sight,\n\n753\n00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.679\nsay, okay, ours, evidence, do not touch.\n\n754\n00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:39.990\nNobody will examine that computer until\nyou actually have a search warrant.\n\n755\n00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.001\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n756\n00:37:41.001 --> 00:37:45.711\n&gt;&gt; So because of the plain view exception,\nwe can essentially encumber the evidence,\n\n757\n00:37:45.711 --> 00:37:47.251\nthe machine, the entity.\n\n758\n00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:51.540\nBut we cannot look at it, examine it,\nunless we have legal right to do so.\n\n759\n00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.325\n&gt;&gt; So if they don't give the legal right,\nthen they just have to return it.\n\n760\n00:37:53.325 --> 00:37:56.008\n&gt;&gt; Then essentially it sits there and\nnobody's able to do anything with it,\n\n761\n00:37:56.008 --> 00:37:58.013\nif they cannot obtain a search\nwarrant after the fact.\n\n762\n00:37:58.013 --> 00:37:58.764\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n763\n00:37:58.764 --> 00:38:02.025\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so you are not able to do that,\nthat's right.\n\n764\n00:38:02.025 --> 00:38:03.041\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Again,\n\n765\n00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:05.557\nit's kind of interesting-\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a really good thing to\n\n766\n00:38:05.557 --> 00:38:08.506\nknow, because if I was an investigator and\nI snatched that as evidence, and\n\n767\n00:38:08.506 --> 00:38:11.010\nI didn't have a warrant And\nI searched it without that warrant.\n\n768\n00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.757\n&gt;&gt; For instance, you sat down-\n&gt;&gt; Now all of a sudden, yeah.\n\n769\n00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see this all\nthe time on TV and movies, right?\n\n770\n00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:17.610\nAgain, you look at this stuff,\nyou're like, but it doesn't work that way.\n\n771\n00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.380\nThat's absolutely patently wrong.\n\n772\n00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.125\nSo they break in, and they're looking for\nevidence of something, right?\n\n773\n00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:26.522\nThey being law enforcement or whoever.\n\n774\n00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:28.926\nAnd they'll sit down at the computer,\nlet me see what he did here.\n\n775\n00:38:28.926 --> 00:38:31.950\nLook, he was out looking for\nplans on the bridge.\n\n776\n00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:32.706\nYou have that kind of stuff.\n\n777\n00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:33.329\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n778\n00:38:33.329 --> 00:38:35.646\n&gt;&gt; I mean, just,\nyou cannot do that, right?\n\n779\n00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:38.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are not allowed to do that.\n\n780\n00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:40.594\nYou can say, look, there's a computer,\n\n781\n00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:42.935\nlet me make sure we put\nan evidence tag on that.\n\n782\n00:38:42.935 --> 00:38:46.697\nStand somebody right next to with a gun,\ndo not allow anyone to touch this, and\n\n783\n00:38:46.697 --> 00:38:49.330\nmake sure it's powered on and\ndoes not get turned off.\n\n784\n00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.203\nBut, you cannot go in there and\nstart hacking away at the system,\n\n785\n00:38:52.203 --> 00:38:54.203\nlook at its stuff,\nuntil you have a warrant.\n\n786\n00:38:54.203 --> 00:38:57.414\nWhich is why, although you don't see\nthis on TV, but in the real world,\n\n787\n00:38:57.414 --> 00:38:59.900\nyou will see warrants show up\nat the site after the fact.\n\n788\n00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.931\nThere's somebody who goes and\ntalks to the judge and says, okay, yeah.\n\n789\n00:39:02.931 --> 00:39:05.895\nAnd then they show up, and they say,\nokay, great, now we can go and\n\n790\n00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:06.800\nwe can do our stuff.\n\n791\n00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.020\nBut that thing sits until they have\nthe right to investigate this.\n\n792\n00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.345\nSo you could seize it, but\nyou cannot actually examine it.\n\n793\n00:39:14.345 --> 00:39:15.006\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting.\n\n794\n00:39:15.006 --> 00:39:16.077\n&gt;&gt; Very important to know.\n\n795\n00:39:16.077 --> 00:39:18.785\nWe've talked about things like\nsearches incident to a lawful arrest,\n\n796\n00:39:18.785 --> 00:39:21.280\ninventory searches, border searches,\nwent through all this.\n\n797\n00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.164\nI just wanted to show you one quick\nthing that really deals with this.\n\n798\n00:39:24.164 --> 00:39:26.426\nIf you give me just a second here,\njust as we're wrapping up,\n\n799\n00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:27.917\nif you wanna join me here on the machine.\n\n800\n00:39:27.917 --> 00:39:32.406\nThe treaty that we are talking about here,\nthrough the Council of Europe,\n\n801\n00:39:32.406 --> 00:39:37.125\nis the Council of Europe's Cybercrime\nConvention, completed in 2001.\n\n802\n00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:40.961\nObliges all signatories to have\nthe ability to affect cross-border\n\n803\n00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:42.424\npreservation requests.\n\n804\n00:39:42.424 --> 00:39:45.535\nMeaning, if government\nA says to government B, hey,\n\n805\n00:39:45.535 --> 00:39:48.930\nsomebody fled our jurisdiction\nwith information we want.\n\n806\n00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.800\nYou need to act on our behalf and\nto go get that and preserve it for us.\n\n807\n00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.207\nIf they're a signatory of this treaty,\nthat's how it happens.\n\n808\n00:39:55.207 --> 00:39:59.333\nSo the Council of Europe, and\nin this case treaty number 185,\n\n809\n00:39:59.333 --> 00:40:03.030\nthe Convention on Cybercrime,\nspecific to cybercrime.\n\n810\n00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.437\nAgain, we're talking about forensic\ninvestigation and digital data and\n\n811\n00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:07.742\npreservation of said data.\n\n812\n00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:10.231\nIs done internationally under\nthis particular treaty, so\n\n813\n00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:12.231\nyou just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n814\n00:40:12.231 --> 00:40:13.768\n&gt;&gt; All right, consent and privacy,\n\n815\n00:40:13.768 --> 00:40:17.720\nprobably not the last time we're going to\nhear those words come up in this series.\n\n816\n00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.893\nBut I'm looking at the clock, and\nwe're definitely going to have to keep\n\n817\n00:40:20.893 --> 00:40:23.979\nrolling on with more parts to our\nwhole entire investigative process.\n\n818\n00:40:23.979 --> 00:40:27.430\nA lot of fun learning how this is done,\nmethodologies behind it, and\n\n819\n00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.302\nthe things that we need to know so\nthat we do it correctly.\n\n820\n00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:34.090\nAnd make sure all that evidence that\nwe've gathered is actually admissible and\n\n821\n00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.948\nusable in court.\n\n822\n00:40:34.948 --> 00:40:38.550\nThat being said, I guess we're\nout of time for this episode,\n\n823\n00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.292\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n824\n00:40:40.292 --> 00:40:43.060\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n825\n00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.549\n&gt;&gt; I'm

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:08.273\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:11.957\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:13.795\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:16.271\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.323\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:23.680\nthat's right, we are coming back with more\non our CHFI series, version 9 that is.\n\n10\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.200\nAnd joining us in the studio again,\nfor more on the investigative process,\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.780\nour good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.830\nAdam, glad to have you yet again,\nman, how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nDo we get like a bonus?\n\n14\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.007\nDo bells and whistles go off?\n\n15\n00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:33.800\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Do we see balloons?\n\n16\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.866\nWe do part nine for version nine, is that\nlike that should be something special.\n\n17\n00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's like one of those wierd-\n&gt;&gt; Like a roll over event on your car when\n\n18\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.070\nthe speedometer goes to a million.\n\n19\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.383\n&gt;&gt; Like when it's 7, 8, 09,\n789 that kind of thing.\n\n20\n00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:47.784\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that would be cool.\n\n21\n00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:48.750\n&gt;&gt; It's cool.\n\n22\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.962\n&gt;&gt; All right, come back and\njoin us for part nine, right?\n\n23\n00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, lets jump back in and\n\n24\n00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:56.164\ncontinue talking about the various things,\nsort of investigative process.\n\n25\n00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:58.591\nWe've been going through\na lot of the legalities,\n\n26\n00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.093\nand the definitions, and concerns\nthat investigators have to abide by,\n\n27\n00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:04.535\nbe aware of with regards to searching and\nseizing.\n\n28\n00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.290\nWe just had a whole conversation about\nwhat we can and cannot do with and\n\n29\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.093\nwithout a warrant.\n\n30\n00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:09.665\nIf you haven't gone through and\nlooked at that.\n\n31\n00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.755\nMaybe of interested to go back,\ntake a look.\n\n32\n00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:14.105\nIt'll reference some of the stuff\nwe're about to get into with\n\n33\n00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:17.055\nthe Privacy Protection Act,\nit's called PPA.\n\n34\n00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:19.685\nAgain, in the United States\nunder federal law,\n\n35\n00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:21.735\nthis is what we're talking about here.\n\n36\n00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:25.045\nWant to always as we do, give you that\ndisclaimer, that we understand there\n\n37\n00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:29.085\nare many, many areas of the world that are\nnot following this exact interpretation of\n\n38\n00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:32.870\na law, may call this by something\ndifferent or refer to it differently.\n\n39\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.878\nBut from an exam perspective, aligning\nwith the exam requirements, and/or just\n\n40\n00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:40.785\nfrom the knowledge perspective around,\nhow the material should be presented.\n\n41\n00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:45.178\nWe're doing this from\nthe US Federal Rules perspective and/or\n\n42\n00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:48.440\nthe US rules overall\nwith regards to evidence.\n\n43\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.460\nSo, just making sure you're aware of that.\n\n44\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.275\nNot wanted to exclude or\ninclude anybody unnecessarily.\n\n45\n00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:58.714\nSo the Privacy Protection Act is important\nand lawful for a government officer to\n\n46\n00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:02.580\nsearch for or seize materials when\ncertain requirements are not met.\n\n47\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.030\nWe should be aware of what they are.\n\n48\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.158\nIf the materials are the product or\nwork, meaning, you are doing something\n\n49\n00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:13.886\nnormally in the conduct of your\neveryday job, we cannot search for and\n\n50\n00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:19.118\nseize that material without a warrant,\nbecause we don't have the right to.\n\n51\n00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:22.475\nThe materials include mental impressions,\nconclusions or theories,\n\n52\n00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.436\nand/or the materials are possessed for the\npurpose of communicating the material to\n\n53\n00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:29.132\nthe public by a person some\nform of public communication,\n\n54\n00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.040\naccording to the statute of law.\n\n55\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.960\nIn other words,\n\n56\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.560\nwe cannot suppress the freedom of\nspeech with regards to searching and\n\n57\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.092\nseizing evidence, because there is\nnot a justifiable reason to do so.\n\n58\n00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.431\nWe cannot come in and steal\nthe spreadsheet right off your machine and\n\n59\n00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:45.040\nencumber this evidence\nwithout a warrant to do so,\n\n60\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.010\nbecause it is the product of normal work.\n\n61\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.100\nThese are things that\nwe've to be aware of.\n\n62\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.670\nAnd the language is broad in the PPA,\nin the Privacy Protection Act, but\n\n63\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.295\nwe do have to understand the privacy\nrights our are forted individuals, and\n\n64\n00:02:56.295 --> 00:03:00.555\nwe have to be aware of and knowledgeable\nof them as forensic investigators.\n\n65\n00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.625\nThe statute does contain exceptions,\nhowever.\n\n66\n00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.405\nSo it's not okay, can't touch anything,\ncan't do anything.\n\n67\n00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.817\nBut rather,\nwe need to understand what we can do.\n\n68\n00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:09.127\nSo we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n69\n00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:12.961\nAlso, one of the big things that often\nhappens that people don't realize they\n\n70\n00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:16.622\nhave to deal with is, let's say\nhypothetically, I have a situation where\n\n71\n00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:20.251\nwe have multiple locations that we want\nto be able to search for evidence.\n\n72\n00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:25.368\nMaybe we feel that a crime scene\nis encompassed in many areas.\n\n73\n00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:28.807\nAnd I talked about this in\nthe last episode where we said,\n\n74\n00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:33.251\neither may be domicile home that has\ntwo buildings on the plot of land, and\n\n75\n00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.558\neach has a separate address, right?\n\n76\n00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:39.906\nThe mother-in-law quarters, whatever you\nwould call them in your part of the world.\n\n77\n00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:43.993\nAnd as a result, or there's all these\ndifferent buildings in different\n\n78\n00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:48.348\ngeographies that make up the entity of\nyour company, abc.com but each one is\n\n79\n00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:52.971\ngonna have its own separate address to\nphysically distinct from every other one,\n\n80\n00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:54.580\nright, that kind of thing.\n\n81\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.665\nAnd as a result of that,\nit's considered its own separate entity.\n\n82\n00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.980\nIf you don't have a multiple,\nlet me try this again,\n\n83\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.780\nif you have a multiple location scenario,\nand don't have multiple warrants to cover\n\n84\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.460\nthose locations,\nyou are not able to legally search.\n\n85\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.471\nSo in other words, you can't use\none blanket warrant that says,\n\n86\n00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:12.608\nwe're gonna go search company abc.com, and\n\n87\n00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:16.331\nfind everything if you don't specify\nwhat all the buildings, the properties,\n\n88\n00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.039\nthe addressable locations will be,\nthat doesn't work.\n\n89\n00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.442\nSo multiple locations, multiple\nwarrants very important to know that.\n\n90\n00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:26.480\nAnd if we don't have those, the fruits of\nthat search are considered inadmissible.\n\n91\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.340\nVery important to think\nabout that as well.\n\n92\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.845\nI'm here to seize, right,\nyour computers, right?\n\n93\n00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:35.375\nCan we knock on the door and say,\nhey, could you please let me in,\n\n94\n00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.745\nI'm the law enforcement officer,\nwho's going to take you to jail.\n\n95\n00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.875\nPlease engage in that illegal\nactivity after you allow me in.\n\n96\n00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:43.635\nGo back to what you were doing,\nso I can arrest you, right?\n\n97\n00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:46.252\nWe don't do that clearly, right,\nthat just doesn't make any sense.\n\n98\n00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:50.102\nIn other words, are we suppose to announce\nourselves, right, and actually knock on\n\n99\n00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:52.512\nthe door and say, please stop what you\nare doing, let me in and then resume.\n\n100\n00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:53.862\nThat's unreasonable.\n\n101\n00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:56.582\nSo we have what are called\nno knock warrants, right?\n\n102\n00:04:56.582 --> 00:05:00.396\nWe have warrants that are issued by\na court that allow law enforcement\n\n103\n00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:04.802\nofficials to literally break down a door,\nand jump into whatever is going on and\n\n104\n00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:05.940\narrest everybody.\n\n105\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.177\nAssuming there is illegal or\n\n106\n00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:09.862\nillicit activity without\nannouncing their presence first.\n\n107\n00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:12.893\nBecause, how many bad guys do you know\nthat are going to engage in that activity?\n\n108\n00:05:12.893 --> 00:05:15.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; After somebody knocks on the door and\n\n109\n00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:18.121\nsays, hey it's the police,\nwould you please allow us in so\n\n110\n00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.500\nwe could observe what you're doing, right?\n\n111\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.030\nSo we call these no knock warrants,\n\n112\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.690\nand you have to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n113\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.000\nAlso we have what are called\ndelayed notice warrants.\n\n114\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.630\nThey allow us to surreptitiously observe,\nwe call is sneaking and peeking.\n\n115\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.502\nOr sneaking and peeing,\nas you certainly may have referred to.\n\n116\n00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:33.322\n&gt;&gt; Yes, when you see the notes,\nyou would know.\n\n117\n00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:34.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you see the notes and\n\n118\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.434\nthe P-E-E is truncated from\nthe rest of that word.\n\n119\n00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:38.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it looks like sneaking peeing.\n\n120\n00:05:38.193 --> 00:05:40.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So sneaking and peeking, right,\n\n121\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.280\nthis is how a lot of\nsurveillance takes place.\n\n122\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.830\nWhere we have the ability to\nwatch somebody do something for\n\n123\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.100\na period of time with the consent of the\ncourt to observe their activities where\n\n124\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.930\nnormally we would not have that right.\n\n125\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.220\nThings like wiretapping, and video\nsurveillance whatever the case may be.\n\n126\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.440\nAnd then as a result of that,\nwe may then be able to\n\n127\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.710\nexecute another warrant to go and search\nafter we gather all that information.\n\n128\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.927\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n129\n00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:08.828\nKeep in mind also we have privilege,\nright,\n\n130\n00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:13.489\nwe talk a lot about privilege sometimes\nthings like doctor-patient privilege.\n\n131\n00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:18.593\nIf you are in a religious setting,\nand you speak to a religious person,\n\n132\n00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:24.477\nsome sort of representative of that faith,\nwhether it is a priest, or a rabbi, or\n\n133\n00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.614\nWhatever that clergy person may be or\nwhatever they are called.\n\n134\n00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:32.190\nWhen you go and talk to them,\n\n135\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.737\nthere is an expectation that that\nconversation is private, and\n\n136\n00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:40.480\nwe're not allowed to divulge or should not\nask for that conversation to be divulged.\n\n137\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.280\nPrivilege, in other words,\n\n138\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.500\nis inviolable as we would say,\nwhen searching certain areas.\n\n139\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.190\nYour lawyer client privilege, right,\nis also considered to be inviolable.\n\n140\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.330\nSo, when you search and look for evidence\nof conversations between a lawyer and\n\n141\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.195\ntheir client,\nyou're not allowed to do that.\n\n142\n00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:57.760\nPatient-doctor, you're not allowed\nto violate that privilege.\n\n143\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.340\nClergyman as I said, things like that.\n\n144\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.040\nYou're not allowed to\nviolate those privileges.\n\n145\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.056\nSo, you may get that person to divulge\ninformation by willingly giving up that\n\n146\n00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:11.075\nright and saying, no, I will allow you\nto talk the person, if they pass away.\n\n147\n00:07:11.075 --> 00:07:15.533\nWe can then go to the lawyer, the clergy\nperson, the Doctor and say look, so and so\n\n148\n00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:19.731\nhas passed away, we think you may have\ninformation about what would have been\n\n149\n00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.046\nconsidered a privileged\nconversation before they passed.\n\n150\n00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:27.070\nBut because they're no longer alive, we\nare asking you now to divulge that because\n\n151\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.039\nof this, this and this circumstance,\nbecause we think it affects something else\n\n152\n00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.008\nthat's ongoing or exigent circumstances,\nwhere we think that conversation can\n\n153\n00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:38.660\nimpact the safety of such and such,\nwe need you to tell us what it is.\n\n154\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.940\nAnd at that point, that person can decide\nto divulge that information, right?\n\n155\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.646\nBut they can't be compelled to,\nwhile that person is alive,\n\n156\n00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:51.566\neven under threat of sanction, because\nthat is considered inviolable right, so\n\n157\n00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:54.152\nI just wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n158\n00:07:54.152 --> 00:07:57.972\nWe have to make sure that, and I've talked\nabout this before, that warrants and\n\n159\n00:07:57.972 --> 00:07:59.672\naffidavits are drafted properly.\n\n160\n00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:03.330\nMeaning, they lay out the expectations\nof what will happen, where,\n\n161\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.306\nunder what circumstances So\nthey answer the who, what,\n\n162\n00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:09.468\nwhen, where, why and how questions,\nand if the warrant for\n\n163\n00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:13.560\nthe affidavit is not sworn out and setup\nproperly, you get out of that search.\n\n164\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.630\nIn other words,\nwhatever’s found is not admissible.\n\n165\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.745\nIf we say we’re searching 123 circle lane,\nand the police show up and\n\n166\n00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:24.340\nserve a warrant at 123 circle place,\nthat is not the same, and that is wrong.\n\n167\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.240\nAnd we've had some evidence\nof that over the year.\n\n168\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.190\nSo unfortunately, where your raids\nhave occurred in wrong locations.\n\n169\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.860\nPeople have been arrested,\nthey even been shot, some of them killed\n\n170\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.920\nby accident because the police\nessentially went to the wrong house, and\n\n171\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.170\nassumed that there was an armed\ndangerous criminal there.\n\n172\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.520\nAnd there was nobody that fit\nthat description there at all,\n\n173\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.890\njust your normal people\ndoing normal things.\n\n174\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.464\nAnd by accident, without realizing\nif they arrested or shot somebody,\n\n175\n00:08:49.464 --> 00:08:51.347\nbecause they were in the wrong place.\n\n176\n00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:54.375\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that happens a lot,\nbut it can happen, right,\n\n177\n00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:55.990\nhuman error occurs all the time.\n\n178\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.650\nNot because people set out to do harm,\nbut because people make mistakes.\n\n179\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.070\nSo we just have to understand that, right?\n\n180\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.170\nThe ECPA standard that we talked about,\n\n181\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.960\nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act\nas well, important to be aware of this.\n\n182\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.770\nStore communications, and\nthe portion of those communications\n\n183\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.600\ncovered under ECPA ensures\nprivacy rights for customers and\n\n184\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.990\nsubscribers of computer\nnetwork service providers.\n\n185\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.245\nIn other words,\nyour content in the cloud with your ISP is\n\n186\n00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:24.447\nprotected under ECPA to a certain degree.\n\n187\n00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:25.820\nSo it's important to know that.\n\n188\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.600\nThere are other laws in other places in\nthe world to protect this content as well.\n\n189\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.130\nAgain, for\ninstance the European Councils or\n\n190\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.000\nthe EU's directive 9546, or\nthe directive that's coming online to\n\n191\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.580\neffectively update that\ngoing into 2018 and beyond.\n\n192\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.400\nProvides for rights and privacy rights for\n\n193\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.460\nthe individual in many\ncircumstances in different areas.\n\n194\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.060\nAnd does extend to things like\nelectronic information as well.\n\n195\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.940\nSo providers have two types,\nwhat we call electronic communication\n\n196\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.850\nservices providers, ECSs, and\nremote computing service providers, RCSs.\n\n197\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.680\nDefined under that statute, you just wanna\nmake sure you have a sense of that, and\n\n198\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.720\ninformation is considered to\nbe a three distinct types.\n\n199\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.332\nWe have basic subscriber information,\nwe have records or\n\n200\n00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:10.319\nother information pertaining to\nthe customer or the subscriber,\n\n201\n00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:13.003\nessentially metadata if you\nwanna think about it that way.\n\n202\n00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:15.820\nAnd then the contents of the data itself.\n\n203\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.330\nSo we have three distinct\ncategories of information\n\n204\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.260\nthat are afforded certain\nkinds of protection.\n\n205\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.700\nSo we may be able to get a list\nof subscribers to a service, but\n\n206\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.245\nnot see the data of any of those\nsubscribers, right, as an example.\n\n207\n00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:31.610\nOr may be able to get the detailed\ndata of one user, but\n\n208\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.040\nin a multi tenant environment,\nnot effect other users.\n\n209\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.826\nSo there's different ways of\ninterpreting this, right?\n\n210\n00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:40.223\nSo five mechanisms that are often\nused with ECPA, we have subpoenas,\n\n211\n00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:45.143\nthe ability to issue from a court a\ndocument that essentially compels somebody\n\n212\n00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:46.275\nto do something.\n\n213\n00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:47.735\nWe hear about this all the time.\n\n214\n00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:51.185\nSubpoenas with prior notice to\nsubscriber customer, a court order,,\n\n215\n00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:55.145\ntrt order with prior notice or\nsearch warrant, they are different things.\n\n216\n00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:58.650\nA court order says,\nyou must comply by such in such date.\n\n217\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.480\nIt is not the same thing\nas a search warrant.\n\n218\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.522\nA search warrant gives a legal\nrepresentative of the court.\n\n219\n00:11:03.522 --> 00:11:07.599\nA law enforcement official or a government\nentity, the right to execute a search on\n\n220\n00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:10.278\nbehalf of the court to bring\nback evidence specified,\n\n221\n00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:13.750\nand sworn out in an affidavit\nthat would in theory be there.\n\n222\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.510\nSo it's different than a court order.\n\n223\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.290\nCourt order may say, you must appear\non this day at this time, and\n\n224\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.750\nsurrender your passport in theory.\n\n225\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.790\nSo you can't leave the jurisdiction.\n\n226\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.520\nA search warrant would allow us to go to\nyour home under certain circumstances, and\n\n227\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.580\nsearch for evidence of illegal activity.\n\n228\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.470\nVery different, so just be aware of that.\n\n229\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.060\nAnd subpoenas can compel you primarily,\nused to compel you to testify,\n\n230\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.880\nthat's usually what they're used for,\nor to show up and present evidence.\n\n231\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.491\nYou can think about it either way but\n\n232\n00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:40.132\nessentially testify in an open\ncourt more often than not.\n\n233\n00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:43.284\nWe also have this concept of\nvoluntary disclosure under ECPA.\n\n234\n00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:48.140\nThe idea that providers of services\nnot available to the public,\n\n235\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:54.830\nmay freely disclose both content and other\nrecords relating to those communications.\n\n236\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.290\nMeaning, if it's something that's publicly\navailable, there is a different standard.\n\n237\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.060\nBut if that content, or\nthat service is not available and\n\n238\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.020\nin plain view of the public,\nthen voluntary disclosure occurs.\n\n239\n00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.305\nThis is what has been kind of the pivot\npoint of a lot of the quote, unquote,\n\n240\n00:12:10.305 --> 00:12:14.475\nshady activities we hear about\nbetween three letter acronym agencies.\n\n241\n00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:19.428\nLike NSA, CIA in the United States, MI6,\nand other entities in foreign counties\n\n242\n00:12:19.428 --> 00:12:22.990\naround the world, Mossad,\nwhatever it may be, Shin Bet.\n\n243\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.698\nThere's different versions of\nthis by country, wherever you go.\n\n244\n00:12:26.698 --> 00:12:30.474\nAnd where you think about and hear about,\nevery so often, all of people like\n\n245\n00:12:30.474 --> 00:12:34.958\nEdward Snowden, and those kinds of people,\nWikiLeaks, etc., that we have heard, and\n\n246\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.160\nindeed have evidence, compelling,\noverwhelming evidence.\n\n247\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.940\nThe fact that government's plural,\nright, have been involved\n\n248\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.630\nwith tapping into the stream of\nelectronic commerce and communication.\n\n249\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.519\nAnd information management and\nstorage ala the cloud and techniques and\n\n250\n00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:56.387\ntechnologies like that via the providers\nunder the concept of voluntary disclosure.\n\n251\n00:12:56.387 --> 00:13:00.650\nNot just under ECPA, but under\nthe associated legal frameworks in various\n\n252\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.070\ncountries that would mirror ECPA,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n253\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.580\nBut the idea is that, this concept of\nvoluntary disclosure that they can work\n\n254\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.520\nwith providers to get them to\nagree to allow the entity in, and\n\n255\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.160\nlook at this information.\n\n256\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.085\nWith the concept of voluntary disclosures,\nhow this is happening more and more?\n\n257\n00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:23.135\nWe may not like it, we may not agree with\nit, we may not think it is appropriate,\n\n258\n00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.445\nbut that doesn't mean it's not happening.\n\n259\n00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:28.379\nAnd we have to understand\nas forensic investigators,\n\n260\n00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.374\nthat this is an area that we\ncan understand, again, and\n\n261\n00:13:31.374 --> 00:13:35.780\noperate within narrowly to allow\nourselves to gain access to information.\n\n262\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.649\nRemember, we have to take off our,\nhey, I'm a private citizen,\n\n263\n00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:40.815\nI'm worried about my privacy hat,\nfor a minute.\n\n264\n00:13:40.815 --> 00:13:45.054\nAnd as an investigator, put on our, hey,\nI have a job and I need to figure out\n\n265\n00:13:45.054 --> 00:13:49.293\nthe best set of tools, and the best set\nof techniques to allow me the broadest\n\n266\n00:13:49.293 --> 00:13:53.620\nability to execute that capability,\nor that job to a successful end hat.\n\n267\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.399\nRight, that's a big hat.\n\n268\n00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a huge hat.\n\n269\n00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:56.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ten gallon wide.\n\n270\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.343\n&gt;&gt; Sombrero.\n\n271\n00:13:57.343 --> 00:14:00.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So as a result, right,\n\n272\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.123\nit's kind of a dichotomy.\n\n273\n00:14:03.123 --> 00:14:07.729\nBecause we have to think in ways that as\nindividuals may not be beneficial to us,\n\n274\n00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:12.203\nbut overall as investigators and\nrepresentatives of a enforcement agency,\n\n275\n00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:17.158\nor some sort of enforcement operation from\nan incident response perspective is gonna\n\n276\n00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:18.020\nbe valuable.\n\n277\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.735\nAnd indeed necessary to the success\nof our evidence gathering activities,\n\n278\n00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:22.844\nwhatever they may be.\n\n279\n00:14:22.844 --> 00:14:24.710\nSo I wanna just make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n280\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.570\nWe also have electronic surveillance and\ncommunication networks\n\n281\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.500\nin the United States, we were just\ntalking about this again in other areas.\n\n282\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.270\nTwo federal statutes govern real\ntime electronic surveillance\n\n283\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.220\nin federal criminal investigations.\n\n284\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:42.249\nThe wiretap statute used to be called\nTitle III of The Omnibus Crime Control and\n\n285\n00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:44.632\nSafe Streets Act in 1968.\n\n286\n00:14:44.632 --> 00:14:49.204\nJust generally referred to as Title III,\nbut it is the wiretap statue that's how we\n\n287\n00:14:49.204 --> 00:14:52.078\nactually used to tap into\nanalog phone systems, and\n\n288\n00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:55.260\nwe extend that out into\nthe digital realm these days.\n\n289\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.870\nRegulates the collection of real time\ngathering of evidence on the wire,\n\n290\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.410\nmeaning as you're talking.\n\n291\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.990\nWe may not be able to interpret and\nintercept traffic,\n\n292\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.360\nunless it is going to fall\ninto one of these areas.\n\n293\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.870\nWe can for instance, have interception\npursuant to a court order.\n\n294\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.340\nSo we can't just walk up,\nrandomly tap a phone line and say, yeah,\n\n295\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.900\nI wanna listen to what,\nso-and-so is saying.\n\n296\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.930\nWe have to have legitimate,\ncompelling arguments and reasons.\n\n297\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.320\nSo we need to have a court order that may\nsay, hey, go do that, it's allowable.\n\n298\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.202\nThe consent exception, the provider\nexception, the computer trespasser\n\n299\n00:15:27.202 --> 00:15:31.266\nexception, the extension telephone\nexception, the inadvertently obtained\n\n300\n00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:32.980\ncriminal evidence exception-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.909\n&gt;&gt; I fell into that room, and\n\n302\n00:15:33.909 --> 00:15:35.611\nall of a sudden-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n303\n00:15:35.611 --> 00:15:37.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I fell into a stack of stuff.\n\n304\n00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.560\nLook at what happened there.\n\n305\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.410\nThe door was open, I swear,\nwhere it was, right?\n\n306\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.640\nNo, there's no scuff marks on there.\n\n307\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.150\nThat wasn't, I don't know what it was.\n\n308\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.480\nMy shoulder doesn't hurt,\nI never broke down that door.\n\n309\n00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.980\nAnd the accessible to\nthe public exception.\n\n310\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.190\nIn other words, this list of exceptions\nto Title III activities allow us,\n\n311\n00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.630\nright, to be able to go in, and\nto actually wiretap and find evidence.\n\n312\n00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.280\nIf we are going to be able to, for\ninstance, perhaps listen in on\n\n313\n00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.079\nan extension to a telephone, right,\nas opposed to the main line.\n\n314\n00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:05.961\nWe may be able to see that movie stunts,\npeople pick up the extension, and\n\n315\n00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:09.030\nwe're able to listen, and we can file\na court order to do these things There's\n\n316\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.349\ndifferent ways we could do this.\n\n317\n00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:14.425\nIf stuff's accessible to the public,\nyou're using a pay phone, right,\n\n318\n00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:18.047\nthat's available on the street,\nwe may be able to tap into that and\n\n319\n00:16:18.047 --> 00:16:22.123\nwire tap that without the same legal\nhurdles that we could if it was an office\n\n320\n00:16:22.123 --> 00:16:26.410\nphone inside a building that's private\nthat in theory nobody could get to.\n\n321\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.680\nThat would be very different.\n\n322\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.940\nWe need a court order for that.\n\n323\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Adam, what about the scanners\nthat can scan radio frequencies and\n\n324\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.690\npick up cell phone conversations?\n\n325\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.080\nIs that admissible because it's\nfreely in the ether or whatever?\n\n326\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.490\n&gt;&gt; So, interesting, so\n\n327\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.730\nit's one of those things where\nthe concept makes sense, right?\n\n328\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.820\nAnd you could, for instance,\ngrab that traffic.\n\n329\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.000\nAnd people do.\n\n330\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.670\nHam radio operators, for instance,\nwill listen in on NASA conversations,\n\n331\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.690\nthe space station,\nall sorts of stuff if you're tuning in.\n\n332\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.620\nAnd it's fine, and there's nothing wrong\nwith that as long as the equipment you\n\n333\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.710\nused to do it is not illegal to posses.\n\n334\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, for instance,\n\n335\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.320\nwith pineapples, right?\n\n336\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you're familiar with the concept.\n\n337\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You probably are.\n\n338\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.440\nYou may or may not be.\n\n339\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.850\nFake cell towers, right,\nthat can be purchased and\n\n340\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.120\nmade because you find the information\nabout how to this online.\n\n341\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.110\nIllegal to own, by the way,\njust to be clear, so\n\n342\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.090\nyou know before you got out and do this.\n\n343\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.995\nBut they are illegal to own\nin the In the United States.\n\n344\n00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:21.395\nThey are reserved for\nlaw enforcement and duly representative,\n\n345\n00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:24.695\nappointed representatives of agencies\nthat have a need to use this stuff.\n\n346\n00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:27.695\nBut essentially, literally,\nyou are setting up a radio tower,\n\n347\n00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:32.045\na cell phone tower with this technology,\ntapping it into the provider network and\n\n348\n00:17:32.045 --> 00:17:34.185\nmaking it appear as if\nit's a real cell tower and\n\n349\n00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:37.475\nthen gathering cell phone numbers,\ninformation.\n\n350\n00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:38.795\nIndeed, you could tap right in and\n\n351\n00:17:38.795 --> 00:17:42.010\nlisten to phone calls on that\nparticular outlet, right?\n\n352\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.550\nThat particular spur of the radio\nnetwork when you set it up.\n\n353\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.650\nSo if you had the ability to use this cuz\nyou are legally able to possess it and\n\n354\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.040\nhad a warrant that allowed you under\nnarrowly defined circumstances to deploy\n\n355\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.040\nthis, which law enforcement agencies do,\n\n356\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.120\nyou would have the right to essentially\nbenefit from the fruits of that.\n\n357\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.570\nBut if you illegally build one of these,\ncuz they are illegal to possess and own.\n\n358\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.890\nAnd actually it's interesting,\ncuz you can actually build one, and\n\n359\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.870\nit's not illegal to build one.\n\n360\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.040\nIt's illegal to operate it.\n\n361\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Operate one.\n\n362\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.360\n&gt;&gt; So, you could build one in theory, as\nlong as you never turn it on and use it.\n\n363\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.760\nBut if you turned one on and\n\n364\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.286\nused it as private citizen,\nand then wiretapped, right?\n\n365\n00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:20.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Thinking, okay,\n\n366\n00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.280\nI'm allowed to do that because it's\npublicly accessible transmissions.\n\n367\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.250\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.590\n&gt;&gt; People with dark glasses and\n\n369\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.720\nsuits are gonna come visit you, and\n\n370\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.800\nyou're not gonna like the outcome\nof that conversation.\n\n371\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.210\nIt is illegal, you're violating several\nrules, and will be guilty of one or\n\n372\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.990\nmore felonies in\nthe United States by doing that.\n\n373\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.325\n&gt;&gt; As Ace Ventura said,\nshall we go to jail?\n\n374\n00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:38.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea, right?\n\n375\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.235\nSo, the other issue here under\nTitle III is the PIN registers and\n\n376\n00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:46.445\ntrap devices,\nactually not in Title 3, of Title 18.\n\n377\n00:18:46.445 --> 00:18:49.805\nIt's called the PIN Trap Statute.\n\n378\n00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:54.085\nAnd this is gonna govern PIN registers and\ntrap and trap devices.\n\n379\n00:18:54.085 --> 00:18:57.417\nIn other words, the actual ability to\nbe able to get information, again,\n\n380\n00:18:57.417 --> 00:19:01.438\nregulates collection of the supporting\nmetadata, not the actual content itself,\n\n381\n00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:02.697\nbut metadata around it.\n\n382\n00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:05.797\nWho called, for how long, where'd\nthey call from, where'd they call to.\n\n383\n00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:07.908\nNot the actual voice\nrecording of the call, but\n\n384\n00:19:07.908 --> 00:19:10.688\nall the supporting elementary\ndata around it, the metadata.\n\n385\n00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:14.578\nThis has, again, proved to be valuable\nto government entities among others,\n\n386\n00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:16.708\nbecause they are constantly trolling for,\nand\n\n387\n00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:20.474\nusing metadata to expand their\ncapabilities to do searching.\n\n388\n00:19:20.474 --> 00:19:23.164\nYou have to put in an application for\na warrant to do this.\n\n389\n00:19:23.164 --> 00:19:25.364\nThis is not something you can just do.\n\n390\n00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:29.024\nBut this is done in the United States\nunder FISA courts, for\n\n391\n00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:31.349\ninstance, where you can\nget this kind of warrant.\n\n392\n00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:34.005\nIt may be done in open\ncourts in certain cases.\n\n393\n00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:39.380\nA lot of times federal government\nracketeering cases against organized crime\n\n394\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.550\nwill involve these kinds of activities\nwhere they're going into wire tapping and\n\n395\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:47.280\nalso PIN tapping to get hours and hours of\nrecorded conversations of who's calling\n\n396\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.180\nwho from where under what circumstances.\n\n397\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.330\nAnd then use that under\nthe RICO statutes and\n\n398\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.930\nthings like that to\nprosecute organized crime.\n\n399\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.760\nDrug dealing crimes syndicates globally\nare brought down with these kind of\n\n400\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.240\nactivities in partnership\nwith multiple countries.\n\n401\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.950\nThere is a lot of reasons why this occurs.\n\n402\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.740\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n403\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.220\nRemember, as evidence,\n\n404\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.200\ncomputer records are really what we're\nfocusing on primarily here anyway.\n\n405\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.186\nAnd they fall into three general\ncategories for us to be aware of.\n\n406\n00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:14.830\nComputer-generated, computer-stored,\ncomputer-generated and stored.\n\n407\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.490\nIn other words, records could be\njust generated by a computer, but\n\n408\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.190\navailable somewhere else,\nnot stored on the computer-\n\n409\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.750\n&gt;&gt; So, like a print out.\n\n410\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hard analog copies of\nsomething can be computer generated but\n\n411\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.930\nnot stored on the hard drive.\n\n412\n00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.680\nThey could be stored on the hard drive or\non a removable device, right?\n\n413\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.800\nOr they could be both,\ngenerated and stored.\n\n414\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.630\nAnd so we wanna make sure\nthat we are aware of that and\n\n415\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.670\njust understand the logic of that.\n\n416\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.210\nAlso we have to think about the hearsay\nrules, which we've talked about already.\n\n417\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.619\nAnd just remind ourselves in\nfact heresay evidence may or\n\n418\n00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:47.130\nmay not be not admissible with\nregards to computer stored records.\n\n419\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.920\nWe have to understand that computer\nstored records contain human statements,\n\n420\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.815\nthat's what we would call them when\nthey are computer generated and stored,\n\n421\n00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:55.140\nthey contain statements.\n\n422\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.270\nThe output of our work is\nconsidered a statement,\n\n423\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.160\na human generated statement under the law,\nthe definition of the law.\n\n424\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.190\nSo when we say human generated statements,\nwe mean you sat down,\n\n425\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.010\nwrote hello world in your word\ndocument and saved it off.\n\n426\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.480\nThat's a human generated statement, right?\n\n427\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.210\nSo at least today anyway, in the future\nwhen we have androids doing all sorts of\n\n428\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.118\nstuff and robots and who knows what,\nmaybe it'll be something hybrid right?\n\n429\n00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:16.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n430\n00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:18.690\nfor today it's called\nhuman generated statement.\n\n431\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.380\nSo human statements must satisfy\nan exception or may satisfy\n\n432\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.030\nexception to the hearsay rule if they\nare the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n433\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.060\nMeaning we may be able to take that human\ngenerated statement out of e-mail or\n\n434\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.070\nout of a Word document or a spreadsheet or\nwhatever and offer to satisfy,\n\n435\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.240\naugment, and validate the truth of\nthe matter under consideration.\n\n436\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.750\nIf it's corroborative evidence,\nin other words, we may be able to do that\n\n437\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.740\neven though it may be considered\nhearsay evidence normally.\n\n438\n00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.750\nSo, again,\nwe defined hearsay evidence earlier,\n\n439\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.700\njust wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n440\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.670\nBefore a court can establish and\nadmit the records.\n\n441\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.930\nIn other words,\nrule on the validity of whether or\n\n442\n00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.770\nnot they will be considered hearsay or\nnot.\n\n443\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.170\nThe court has to establish that\nthe statements contained in the records\n\n444\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.830\nwere made in and under circumstances that\ntend to ensure their trustworthiness.\n\n445\n00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.030\nIn other words, we have to make sure you\nwere not coerced to make the statements.\n\n446\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.940\nNobody threatened you, bribed you,\nheld a gun to your head.\n\n447\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.900\nNobody hacked in and modified\nthe statements after you made them.\n\n448\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.950\nShowing clear evidence of them\nbeing modified and not correct,\n\n449\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.170\naccurate and true.\n\n450\n00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.470\nThere's all these things we'd\nhave to think about, right?\n\n451\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.120\nSo if Daniel is standing off camera\nwith a gun pointed at me saying, hey,\n\n452\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.920\nyou better say it this way, right,\n\n453\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.390\nthis is where you would pan to him and\nshow he's threatening me.\n\n454\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.575\nI'm just saying, Taylor.\n\n455\n00:22:28.575 --> 00:22:29.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No pressure,\n\n456\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.585\ndon't worry about covering me in this one.\n\n457\n00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:33.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In case you were wondering,\n\n458\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.970\nwhat he's up to when I'm on camera, right?\n\n459\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.610\nSo if he was actually doing that,\nthen that, if a court found out about that\n\n460\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.880\nwould say, hey, by the way, guess what,\nwe can't allow anything you\n\n461\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.330\nsaid to be used because you were being\ncoerced, it wasn't truthful, right?\n\n462\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.090\nSo, I wanna make sure\nwe're just aware of that.\n\n463\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.950\nAll right, how do I verify and\nreally understand those things?\n\n464\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.360\nThis is obviously part of the general\nthought process we've been talking about.\n\n465\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.840\nWe have to also understand that when\nevidence is put in for us to you think\n\n466\n00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.210\nabout and understand and look at, we have\nto think about the assessment of evidence.\n\n467\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.470\nWe have to go through the process\nthat we've been talking about and\n\n468\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.680\nreally understand in the investigative\nprocess what the output is, the evidence.\n\n469\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.470\nAnd is it gonna have\nthe capability to be presented?\n\n470\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.710\nWe've been hitting on this and\nreally thinking about it.\n\n471\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.250\nWe have to think about reviewing file\nnames for relevancy and patterns.\n\n472\n00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.630\nIs there evidence we can find that shows\nthat it stands out around the background,\n\n473\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.280\nfor instance, from other evidence.\n\n474\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.360\nFile headers and file extensions,\ndo they match or mismatch,\n\n475\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.430\nthere may be evidence\nof modification there.\n\n476\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.910\nWe'll talk more about this in some\nupcoming conversations where we look at\n\n477\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.010\nWindows forensics, LINUX forensics, etc.\n\n478\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.860\nLook at data on a hard drive in those\nconversations coming up where we talk\n\n479\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.089\nabout hard disks and file systems, where\nwe talk much later on in conversations\n\n480\n00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:43.064\nabout e-mail and e-mail headers.\n\n481\n00:23:43.064 --> 00:23:45.050\nIt's very important to know\nwhat's going on there.\n\n482\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.900\nWho sent the e-mail?\n\n483\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.240\nWhat systems did it go through?\n\n484\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.720\nWhere did it come from?\n\n485\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.900\nWhere did it wind up going?\n\n486\n00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.322\nDid it really come from there?\n\n487\n00:23:51.322 --> 00:23:53.590\nIf not, why not?\n\n488\n00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.120\nThese are things we want to be aware of.\n\n489\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.930\nSo you want to think about that,\nreviewing date and\n\n490\n00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.080\ntime stamp file, data and metadata.\n\n491\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.060\nWe've talked about the value\nof time stamping and logging,\n\n492\n00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.210\nvery important to be thinking about that.\n\n493\n00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.310\nDo we have the ability,\nare we able to correlate\n\n494\n00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.900\nthe activity we see on the local machine\nagainst network logs and firewalls,\n\n495\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.940\nrouters, IDS, IPS, gateway systems?\n\n496\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.701\nLooking at traffic flow, things like\nTraceRoute and understanding that as we\n\n497\n00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.611\nlook at network forensics later\non we talk about some of this.\n\n498\n00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:22.149\nAnd scope and tailor data,\nbe able to filter and\n\n499\n00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:24.570\ncreate relevancy based\non how we present it.\n\n500\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.610\nIn other words, we may dump terabytes of\ndata from a system, but really I only\n\n501\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.880\nwanna focus on three or four files when\nwe present that evidence in court.\n\n502\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.620\nWe're not gonna present all the evidence,\nalthough we're gonna reference the fact\n\n503\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.800\nthat we got the three or four files\nfrom that large evidentiary dump.\n\n504\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.190\nBut the idea is that we would be able to\nzero in on, as an investigator, the files\n\n505\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.880\nthat are relevant and provide for\nthe evidence necessary to make our case.\n\n506\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.050\nAnd so, just wanna be thinking about these\nthings as we wrap up our conversations\n\n507\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:50.860\nin this area.\n\n508\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.140\nBut we're not done yet, right?\n\n509\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.270\nBecause we are gonna come back and\nwe are gonna do some hands on discussion\n\n510\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.710\nslash interaction and\nstart applying some of this knowledge.\n\n511\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.610\nWe've spent so much time in\nthe last group of episodes, right?\n\n512\n00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.450\nProbably 12, 13 episodes to date so far,\nreally, just discussing nothing but\n\n513\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.290\nthe foundational knowledge of how\nwe become a forensic investigator,\n\n514\n00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.690\nwhat is important for us to know,\n\n515\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.170\nwhat are the rules and the laws we\nhave to abide by in many cases.\n\n516\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.670\nWe're gonna start applying some of that\nknowledge, I'm gonna walk you through,\n\n517\n00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.360\nshow you how to use some of\nthe basic case management tools.\n\n518\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.288\nPowerBins tool, for instance, going in and\nsetting up a case and load some data up.\n\n519\n00:25:25.288 --> 00:25:27.276\nTake a look at how we search for\ndeleted files.\n\n520\n00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:30.933\nWe're gonna do some cool stuff, so wanna\nhave you come back, take a look at that,\n\n521\n00:25:30.933 --> 00:25:33.240\nand then from there,\nwho knows what we'll do?\n\n522\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n523\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.440\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It depends.\n\n524\n00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.280\n&gt;&gt; It'll be a juggling show [LAUGH].\n\n525\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.490\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of cool stuff.\n\n526\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.250\nYou never know.\n\n527\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Adam, super looking forward to that.\n\n528\n00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.040\nThis is awesome conversation.\n\n529\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.220\nI always enjoy this kind of stuff.\n\n530\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:41.890\nI love security.\n\n531\n00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.510\nI love legalities and\njust the minutiae there.\n\n532\n00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.470\nAnd leaning on your expertise and\n\n533\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.670\nexperience in that has\nbeen a lot of fun for me.\n\n534\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.450\nHopefully it has been for you as well.\n\n535\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.890\nSo come on back, let's see what\nelse this man's got up his sleeve\n\n536\n00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.760\nas far as tricks go in in our forensics.\n\n537\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.536\n&gt;&gt; And I have long sleeves.\n\n538\n00:25:58.536 --> 00:26:00.068\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You see they're pushed up [CROSSTALK]\n\n539\n00:26:00.068 --> 00:26:03.044\nSo when I pull them down, lots of room\nto hide stuff, you'll never know.\n\n540\n00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:05.332\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right, everyone, thanks for\n\n541\n00:26:05.332 -->

00:00:31.012\nAdam, welcome back man, how’s it going?\n\n14\n00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.508\n&gt;&gt; How do, it is going well-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:34.107\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully it is going\n\n16\n00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:34.678\ngood for all of you.\n\n17\n00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:35.866\nI’m standing off to the side,\n\n18\n00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.020\nhopefully you noticed that\nI was a little off-center.\n\n19\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.078\nAnd the reason for that is,\n\n20\n00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:42.260\nwe're gonna engage in some activities\nthat require hands-on demonstrations.\n\n21\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.640\nAnd therefore, I must be at\nthe appropriate workstation, set up and\n\n22\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.480\nready to go.\n\n23\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.874\nTie me to the console.\n\n24\n00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:50.374\n[CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:50.878\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n26\n00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:53.398\nwe're gonna jump right in, I promised\nyou in the end of the last episode\n\n27\n00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.338\na little hands-on demonstration of some\nthings that we've been talking about for\n\n28\n00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:57.170\nquite some time.\n\n29\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.020\nSo without further ado, Danny,\ndo you wanna come over here and drive?\n\n30\n00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.665\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n31\n00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:01.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so let's get started.\n\n32\n00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:04.045\nSo what we're going to do is take\na look at this Windows 10 machine,\n\n33\n00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:05.525\nvirtual machine, that we're going to run.\n\n34\n00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.738\nWe'll pretend this is, for\npurposes of a lot of our demonstrations,\n\n35\n00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:10.050\nour forensic workstation.\n\n36\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.227\nMeaning, we talked about setting up a lab\nin prior episodes, how to load forensic\n\n37\n00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:17.920\nsoftware, how to start doing\nthings on a dedicated workstation.\n\n38\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.270\nNow we'll just have an assumption\nin our minds that this machine,\n\n39\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.130\nI'll use a use a Server 12 R2\ndesktop from time to time.\n\n40\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.380\nOccasionally a Server 16 machine,\nmaybe to show you some things.\n\n41\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.769\nTry to split up and show you how tools\nwill work on some of the most recent\n\n42\n00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.965\noperating systems across different areas.\n\n43\n00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:36.543\nWe'll take a look at Linux,\non some cases take a look at Kali, look at\n\n44\n00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:40.770\nthe security engineering toolkit in there\nand some of the tools we can use there.\n\n45\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.276\nSo, we'll be jumping around into different\nOSes, doing a variety of different things.\n\n46\n00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:48.670\nBut we’re gonna use Windows 10 as kind of\nour standard workstation thought process.\n\n47\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.452\nWhether you use that today or not,\nwould work the same way in Windows 7,\n\n48\n00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:52.740\nin Windows 8, Windows 8.1.\n\n49\n00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.186\nThe background will be different,\nthe look and feel,\n\n50\n00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:58.803\nthe navigation would be different, but\nthe tools would essentially install and\n\n51\n00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:00.418\nwork the same way for the most part.\n\n52\n00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:04.403\nSo it is a little dark on the background\nthere, so just so you can see what’s going\n\n53\n00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:08.522\non, and we’ll tell you and kinda walk you\nthrough the logical tools we’re using.\n\n54\n00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:09.732\nAnd we're gonna go in and\n\n55\n00:02:09.732 --> 00:02:13.795\nlook at several different aspects of\nhow we begin the investigative process.\n\n56\n00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.950\nSpent a lot of time talking\nabout this up until now.\n\n57\n00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.560\nWhat are some of the tools we can use\nto verify the integrity of files,\n\n58\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.878\nonce we capture images?\n\n59\n00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:24.910\nSo we'll talk about hashing, using our\nhash calp tool, sitting right down here.\n\n60\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.734\nWe'll bring that up and\ntake a look at that in just a moment.\n\n61\n00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:30.836\nWe'll take a look at how to set up and\ncreate a case, and\n\n62\n00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:34.620\nopen up an evidentiary library,\nand start adding evidence to it.\n\n63\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.720\nWe'll take a look at this tool right here,\n\n64\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.020\npower bins examiner tool,\nwe've already loaded up an image.\n\n65\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.478\nWe've got a bunch of stuff in\nhere that we've recovered,\n\n66\n00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:42.176\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n67\n00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:46.974\nWe're gonna talk about on how to do a deep\nscan for and deep examination of files\n\n68\n00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:51.786\nthat may or may not be present on the\ndrive, through the graphical interface.\n\n69\n00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:53.582\nIn other words, things that may\nhave been removed or deleted.\n\n70\n00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:58.762\nWe'll take a look at\nthe EaseUS data recovery tool.\n\n71\n00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:02.881\nWe can go through and\ndo a search and find deleted files,\n\n72\n00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:07.390\nlike this file right here,\nfor instance, DW_Free.exe.\n\n73\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.230\nIf you look at my desktop,\nyou will find that the list of files that\n\n74\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.495\nare on the desktop doesn't match\nthe actual list of executables here.\n\n75\n00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:23.478\nYes, CHFI v9 folder is still there,\nbut ptc_demo.exe,\n\n76\n00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:28.068\nand drw_free.exe, and fileviewer.exe.\n\n77\n00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:31.053\nSome of these files do not\nexist because they were there,\n\n78\n00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:34.114\nI used them to install the tools,\nand then I deleted them.\n\n79\n00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.509\nAnd I can actually recover\nthem just by looking at and\n\n80\n00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.480\nviewing files using a tool like this.\n\n81\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.030\nSo we'll take a look at\nsome of these things and\n\n82\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.520\nhow they work, and show you the ins and\nouts of how to recover data.\n\n83\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.412\nLet's start by taking a look at\nwhat we would do to hash a file.\n\n84\n00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:50.699\nHashing is kind of an interesting concept,\nDaniel and I, Cherokee and I, Mike and I,\n\n85\n00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.893\nprobably Don and I,\nif I go back far enough.\n\n86\n00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:55.781\nOn all the different shows\nI've done on security,\n\n87\n00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:59.510\nover the years that I've been\nspending time with you at ITProTV.\n\n88\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.735\nWe've talked about hashing in numerous\nepisodes in numerous shows for\n\n89\n00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:03.764\na variety of reasons.\n\n90\n00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:05.715\nThe good news is that\ncontent doesn't change and\n\n91\n00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:07.580\nthe standard conversation applies, right?\n\n92\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.820\nI mean, it doesn't change,\nit is the same thought process.\n\n93\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.964\nBut let's make sure we give\nyou the benefit of that,\n\n94\n00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:15.179\nin case you may not have seen those, or\nyou're just maybe new to us and may never\n\n95\n00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.235\nhave really stopped to think about\nwhat a hash is and why it's important.\n\n96\n00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:21.830\nSo when we think about hashing,\nwe're using a tool like a hash calculator,\n\n97\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.120\nfreely available to you,\nyou can download off the Internet.\n\n98\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.780\nAnd it's just going to generate hashes for\nus, and\n\n99\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.600\nwe'll talk about what that means and\nwhy that's important right now.\n\n100\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.765\nLet's move this over here to the mild,\nor the left side of the screen, rather,\n\n101\n00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:34.732\nwhile we're talking.\n\n102\n00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:38.499\nAnd so the idea of a hash calculator\nis the idea of generating an integrity\n\n103\n00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:39.190\nmechanism.\n\n104\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.804\nAn integrity check, we call it a hash\nvalue, when we use it for files,\n\n105\n00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:47.180\nwhen we use it for email, to digitally\nassign what we call a message digest.\n\n106\n00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.773\nThe hash value is gonna be\na numerical representation,\n\n107\n00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:54.068\nactually an alphanumeric\nrepresentation in hex.\n\n108\n00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:57.956\nOf our ability to be able to specify\nthat the file or the content,\n\n109\n00:04:57.956 --> 00:05:02.420\nwhatever it is, folder, file,\ndirectory, whatever we're hashing.\n\n110\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.989\nThe input data is gonna be of a certain\ntype and of a certain style and\n\n111\n00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:09.437\nat a certain point in its maturity,\n\n112\n00:05:09.437 --> 00:05:12.880\nin the sense that we know\nit's in a certain state.\n\n113\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.266\nAnd we're gonna then represent that state\nwith the alphanumeric representation of\n\n114\n00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:19.554\na hash, and that state should be identical\nthroughout the life cycle of the data as\n\n115\n00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:20.140\nwe manage it.\n\n116\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.304\nMeaning, if at any point in the future,\nwe represent that data again by checking\n\n117\n00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:28.224\nthe hash to see whether or not the data\nhas changed, and the hash is the same,\n\n118\n00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:32.410\nwe know the data has what we call\nintegrity, data has not been modified.\n\n119\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.550\nIf the hash has changed,\nwe know the data does not have integrity.\n\n120\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.348\nWe have essentially\nseen the data modified.\n\n121\n00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:40.008\nWe may not know what the modification is,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n122\n00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:42.080\nWhat we know is that\nthe data has been modified.\n\n123\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.216\nSo if we go back to what we were\nlooking at just a moment ago,\n\n124\n00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:48.810\nif we can go full screen,\njust you can see this a little bit easier.\n\n125\n00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.590\nI have a statement here that says, the dog\nis red, I know it's a little hard to see.\n\n126\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.249\nBut what I have is this statement\nright here, the dog is red,\n\n127\n00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.352\nwith a period at the end.\n\n128\n00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.494\nI'm gonna generate an MD5 and a SHA1 hash.\n\n129\n00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:03.798\nAs a matter of fact, while we're doing\nthis, let me make that font just a wee\n\n130\n00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:07.380\nbit bigger, just to make it\na little bit easier for you to see.\n\n131\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.018\nOkay, so we're gonna generate an MD5 and\na SHA1 hash and just paste them in here.\n\n132\n00:06:11.018 --> 00:06:14.670\nAnd so I'm going to go ahead, and\nyou'll see I've selected MD5 and SHA1, and\n\n133\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.840\nI have some other hash strings selected,\nI'll just deselect those,\n\n134\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.158\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n135\n00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:21.624\nWe're gonna calculate, and\nwe get the appropriate hash.\n\n136\n00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:26.185\nLet me just grab this,\nwe'll just copy this off right here, and\n\n137\n00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:29.402\nwe'll go to MD5, and we'll paste that in.\n\n138\n00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:34.970\nAnd that is the hash value,\nthe 128-bit hash value, by the way\n\n139\n00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:42.460\nFor MD5,\ncuz MD5 puts out 128 bit hash value.\n\n140\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.342\nFor the SHA1, grab that one,\n\n141\n00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:53.098\njust paste that in here.\n\n142\n00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:56.567\nThat is going to be a little bit longer,\nthat is going to be 160 bits.\n\n143\n00:06:56.567 --> 00:07:00.612\nIn case somebody were to ask you at some\npoint in the future, what is the bit\n\n144\n00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:05.330\nlength of a SHA-1 or MD5 hash, you should\nbe familiar with that, just so you know.\n\n145\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.194\nAll right, so we have our\nrepresentation of the dog is red.\n\n146\n00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:12.515\nNow if we decide to go ahead and\nto rerun the hash,\n\n147\n00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:18.590\nlet's say we've waited five minutes, ten\nminutes, an hour, a day, a month, a year.\n\n148\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.380\nIt doesn't matter, some point in\nthe future, and we shut down the tool and\n\n149\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.140\nopen it back up again,\nas we would often do.\n\n150\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.080\nSo let's just go back, launch the tool,\n\n151\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.410\nwe'll see that the tool has no\ndata that's remaining in there.\n\n152\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.640\nSo we have to re-import our data,\nno big deal.\n\n153\n00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.686\nWe'll just go ahead and\ngrab our same statement, the dog is red.\n\n154\n00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:39.546\nAnd we will just come\nback right over here,\n\n155\n00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:45.530\npaste that in there,\nrun the same hash calculation again.\n\n156\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.590\nAnd we can see without even looking,\nand I don't have to look, I know that,\n\n157\n00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:58.570\nThe hash value is the same for both MD5.\n\n158\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.369\nAnd if I did it for SHA1,\nyou would see it is same,\n\n159\n00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:03.661\nmeaning the data has not been modified.\n\n160\n00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:07.241\nNo matter how long the data's been in our\npossession, we have not seen a change.\n\n161\n00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:10.680\nNow, this is part of what we do and talk\nabout the chain of custody of evidence.\n\n162\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.549\nWhen we think about this, the idea is we\nhad been talking about that we need to\n\n163\n00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:18.419\nestablish a chain of custody around\nthe evidence, validate the evidence,\n\n164\n00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:22.430\nhad been seized and tagged and bagged and\nanalyzed and put in a secure storage.\n\n165\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.460\nWe do all that, but we also have to\ncertify the evidence had maintained itself\n\n166\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.410\nin the appropriate state\nat the moment of seizure,\n\n167\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.510\nmeaning they forensically sound deep\nstream duplicate copy of the evidence that\n\n168\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.640\nwas created with the right blocker that\nwe now use to do our investigation on.\n\n169\n00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.860\nHas to be hashed, the original\nsource drive has to be hashed, and\n\n170\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.040\nthose two hashes have to\nbe compared to ensure that\n\n171\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.530\nthe evidence we find in the copy can\nbe attributed to the original and\n\n172\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.880\nthat there's been no\nmodification of the source data.\n\n173\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.120\nAs part of the process of investigation.\n\n174\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.750\nAnd so\nhashing becomes a really very valuable,\n\n175\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.860\nindeed vital, cannot do this work\nwithout it mechanism that we use.\n\n176\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.980\nBecause to present\nforensically sound legally\n\n177\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.030\nclassified gathered and presentable or\n\n178\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.850\nconsidered to be presentable evidence\nunder the current laws, in a court of law,\n\n179\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.810\nas a witness, we have to provide hashes\nof everything that we have done.\n\n180\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.440\nTo cross walk and validate that\nthe evidence has not been modified.\n\n181\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.820\nThis is very important.\n\n182\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.590\nWhen the evidence is modified so\nif we close out the tool and\n\n183\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.930\nwe decide to do the dog as read no period.\n\n184\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.340\nRight.\nWhich if you think about it,\n\n185\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.090\nit's not a huge modification, but what\nif the sentence was the dog is red and\n\n186\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.209\nthen the next sentence was and\nI did not feed the dog at 8 AM.\n\n187\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.020\nAnd if I have to separate sentences,\nmaybe indicating two separate distinct\n\n188\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.700\nactivities but if then if I move\nthe period and maybe join them together.\n\n189\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.960\nMaybe now that means\nsomething different and\n\n190\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.150\nas a result,\nmaybe interrupted differently.\n\n191\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.895\nHard so say, my example doesn't\nreally lend itself to that.\n\n192\n00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:55.500\nBut, when you are doing this live\non the fly with no safety net,\n\n193\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.850\nthat's what you get, what can I tell you.\n\n194\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.260\nAll right so if you wanted to the dog is\nred with no period just to show that it\n\n195\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.780\nwill change.\n\n196\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.470\nThe hash, let's go back here.\n\n197\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.650\nLet's go back to hash calc one more time.\n\n198\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.530\nLet's go in.\n\n199\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.700\nLet's paste that.\n\n200\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.040\nAnd we'll be five shy one.\n\n201\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.820\nAnd let's calculate.\n\n202\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.920\nAnd without even needing to look,\nI can tell you that the MD five hash.\n\n203\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.700\nIs going to be different as you can see,\nand\n\n204\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.640\nthe shy one hash of course, as well,\nwill be different, as you can see.\n\n205\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.120\nAnd as a result of that, just do that so\nwe can tell, and scroll back up just\n\n206\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.350\na little bit so you can see,\nthat the hashes are indeed different, and\n\n207\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.870\nas a result of that we do see\nthe data's been modified.\n\n208\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.600\nIf we were coming to this\ninvestigation first thing, and\n\n209\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.930\nnot understanding that the original\ndata was the dog is red period,\n\n210\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.250\nwe now have indications of that, and would\nobviously think that somebody has been in\n\n211\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.550\nthere doing things they're not\nsupposed to do with the data.\n\n212\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.610\nIf we didn't have the hashes, we would\nhave no way of knowing the data had been\n\n213\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.740\nmodified, and we may assume that the data\nin its current state is the actual data.\n\n214\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.790\nAnd we make bad choices and\npresent false evidence without meaning to.\n\n215\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.070\nOr, perhaps, be steered to do that\non purpose by somebody looking to\n\n216\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.230\nmanipulate the process, right.\n\n217\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.660\nIf they were to hide evidence\nof their wrongdoing.\n\n218\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.540\nSo it is important for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n219\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.490\nThink about unique identifiers,\nlike account numbers,\n\n220\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.540\nSSN, social security numbers, employee\nIDs, things like that in an investigation.\n\n221\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.490\nIf those were modified to hide\nthe fact that somebody did or\n\n222\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.600\ndid not do something in a certain account.\n\n223\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.380\nOr with a certain credential,\nhashing would indicate that for\n\n224\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.040\nus if we had documentary\nevidence of the data, right?\n\n225\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.740\nSo hashing is one of the ways that we do\nthis, very important for us to be aware of\n\n226\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.750\nthe use of hashing and why it is so\nfundamental to investigative process.\n\n227\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.190\nWe've talked a lot about this,\nI wanted to show you how that would work.\n\n228\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.010\nAnother one of the tools that we want\nto take into account and be aware of.\n\n229\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.740\nI mentioned this tool.\n\n230\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.660\nShowed it to you a moment ago.\n\n231\n00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.180\nI'm just going to make this full screen so\nyou can see this here.\n\n232\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.000\nIs a tool that allows us to go back and\n\n233\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.590\nis the name of the tool\napplies up here data recovery.\n\n234\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.830\nAllows us to go in and\nto be able to recover deleted data.\n\n235\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.490\nYou will often get a forensic image.\n\n236\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.170\nWe will talk about how to create images of\ndrives in another episode at some point.\n\n237\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.240\nBut let's just assume for\na minute we have an image.\n\n238\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.180\nWhether we've used a creation tool like\nDD in Linux, drive duplication right or\n\n239\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.370\nsomething like that.\n\n240\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.700\nWhatever it may be drive copy,\nwhatever it is.\n\n241\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.670\nWe've done it for instance.\n\n242\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.730\nWe've soundly used the right blocker.\n\n243\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.990\nWe have that image file.\n\n244\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.650\nWe are now going to go ahead and\n\n245\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.830\nload that image file up and\nwe are going to examine what's there.\n\n246\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.940\nIn upcoming episodes in\nthe mobile forensics area for\n\n247\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.910\ninstance, I'll do the same\nthing with a phone image.\n\n248\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.010\nAnd I'll show you what an image\nof a phone looks like and\n\n249\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.960\nwhat kind of data we\ncan recover from there.\n\n250\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.840\nIn the email forensics episodes,\nI'll do the same thing with, as we said,\n\n251\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.830\na PST or an OST.\n\n252\n00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.400\nNot an image, but an offline cache,\nor an offline file, or\n\n253\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.070\na data file, if you will, of email\nthat may be found on a local machine.\n\n254\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.330\nWe would get that traditionally\nby creating an image, and\n\n255\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.550\nI'll show you how to read those,\nload those into tools for\n\n256\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.620\nrecovery and walk you through the process\nof how do I find email in that PST?\n\n257\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.560\nThat's pretty easy.\n\n258\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.680\nHow do I find them in an OST?\n\n259\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.390\nNot hard.\n\n260\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.590\nBut how do we get the forensically\nsound copy to then load It up, but\n\n261\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.510\na little bit more involved.\n\n262\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.120\nSo we have to obviously be aware of that.\n\n263\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.200\nBut let's assume for a minute, that I've\ngone ahead and I've captured an image, and\n\n264\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.800\nnow I'm interrogating that image.\n\n265\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.710\nI showed you that there are executables\nhere that had been removed that\n\n266\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.850\nare no longer there that I can now find.\n\n267\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.600\nAnd so for instance, you'll notice I\ncan right-click, choose Recover and\n\n268\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.150\nI can actually bring that file\nback if I want to, right?\n\n269\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.990\nSo I would have the capability to do this.\n\n270\n00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.010\nRemember, we're doing this on a,\nfor instance, workstation.\n\n271\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.600\nNot on the original source drive.\n\n272\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.510\nNot on the original source machine.\n\n273\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.060\nWe're doing this on a separate machine,\nin our Windows 10 VM in this case.\n\n274\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.740\nAnd by the way,\nforensic workstations are many times\n\n275\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.370\ncreated as virtual instances today so\nthat we can.\n\n276\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.590\nSnapshot them as we begin or however we\nthink of that whatever that may be called.\n\n277\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.740\nCreate a baseline for what the system\nlooked like before we started working with\n\n278\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.080\nthe data right that's what a snapshot\nwould traditionally be referred to as.\n\n279\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.860\nOr a checkpoint they're called\ndifferent things based on the vendor\n\n280\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.270\nthat you may be using.\n\n281\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.940\nOnce we do that, we're then gonna go ahead\nand run through loading up the data,\n\n282\n00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.870\nproviding the images,\nusing whatever tools are necessary and\n\n283\n00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.980\nthen we'll be able to do our\ninvestigation along the way.\n\n284\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.740\nSo this may not be a physical machine.\n\n285\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.590\nIt may be a virtual machine.\n\n286\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.250\nIt's very common these days.\n\n287\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.830\nAnd so a lot of times we'll be doing\nthis in a virtual environment.\n\n288\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.680\nNo big deal, the tools work the same.\n\n289\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.520\nThat run the same way.\n\n290\n00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.420\nThere's really no issue.\n\n291\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.470\nThere's added benefit when we get into\nthings like malware, for instance,\n\n292\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.500\nwhich we will talk about in\nupcoming conversations as well,\n\n293\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.050\nbecause we have to isolate that system\nin order to examine the malwares.\n\n294\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.690\nSo be able to physically isolate it\nby uncoupling it from the network,\n\n295\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.120\nphysical or virtual machine.\n\n296\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.500\nNotwithstanding is easy.\n\n297\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.250\nBut then, we wanna memory isolate\nthe VM instance by running in itself\n\n298\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.890\nmemory space.\n\n299\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.800\nIt's on bubble, we could do that as\na hosted our VM rather running on a host.\n\n300\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.370\nWe can dedicate resources to it and\nfirewall them off logically and physically\n\n301\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.210\nso we're gonna get some advantage from\nthat, that's just something to consider.\n\n302\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.020\nBut you could see we could go in and\nwe could look for all sorts of things.\n\n303\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.420\nWe may be able to go in as\nI trip over my tongue and\n\n304\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.260\nlook at searches that may\nhave been created and\n\n305\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.470\nundertaken under the guise of this user,\nSally my alter alias that I'm using.\n\n306\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.780\nI'm logged in here, right?\n\n307\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.280\nAnd you could see that if\nI've done a Windows search,\n\n308\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.850\nan index search of Windows content on\nlocal desktop, I may be able to get that.\n\n309\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.550\nIndex location searches,\nI may be able to recover that.\n\n310\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.230\nContacts, I don't have any in there but\nif I did I may be able to find those.\n\n311\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.880\nCookies, if I'd gone out and\nhad cookies I'd find those, right?\n\n312\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.970\nI may be able to find things\nthat were in the Start menu,\n\n313\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.240\nthings that were sent to recent.\n\n314\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.960\nApplication data,\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n315\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.900\nMy Documents, I don't have a lot of\nstuff in there, but obviously I could.\n\n316\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.580\nYou could see does, the software does\ninstall a folder there, but you know,\n\n317\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.340\nthe things like My Pictures,\nMy Videos, right?\n\n318\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.130\nThis is just the default,\nwe used a Windows 10 instance,\n\n319\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.070\ncreated it out of the box, just set it up,\ndidn't add anything to it.\n\n320\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.480\nIt's a clean system, remember,\nyou as a forensics workstation,\n\n321\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.100\nyou wanna get rid of all that extraneous\nstuff that's gonna be on there to\n\n322\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.660\ndistract us cuz concern about\npotentially infecting or\n\n323\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.470\nmodifying data or causing it to be\npresented in a way that's not accurate.\n\n324\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.610\nSo we're not gonna have a lot of stuff\naround there as a starting point.\n\n325\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.640\nWe're not going to install\nextraneous software,\n\n326\n00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.890\nwe're gonna remove all of that bloat where\nan extraneous software that we don't\n\n327\n00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.810\nwant on there,\nthat doesn't belong there, right?\n\n328\n00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.285\nI mean, I need Microsoft Office\non a forensics workstation,\n\n329\n00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:02.250\nunless I have a reason to\nlook at Word documents.\n\n330\n00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.875\nTypically, we wouldn't do it on\nthe workstation, we would extract them and\n\n331\n00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.992\nthen make a copy of them,\nhashing the copy And\n\n332\n00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:11.153\ngo to a separate area where we\ncould view those documents, right?\n\n333\n00:16:11.153 --> 00:16:12.042\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n334\n00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:13.166\nPDFs, things like that.\n\n335\n00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:14.990\nWe may install readers, but we may not.\n\n336\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.891\nIt's up to us.\n\n337\n00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:16.990\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n338\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.357\nSo not necessarily finding stuff there\nmakes sense in a forensic work station,\n\n339\n00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:24.236\nbut imagine this was\nsomebody's actual computer?\n\n340\n00:16:24.236 --> 00:16:27.640\nWe would probably find quite a bit\nof stuff in those folders, right?\n\n341\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.436\nJust so you know, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n342\n00:16:29.436 --> 00:16:31.360\nBut you know I have favorites, right?\n\n343\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.440\nSo Bing is the default URL set up for\nEdge, right?\n\n344\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.550\nSo I have the Bing URL there so\nI can find that URL, I could go out and\n\n345\n00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.660\nI could preview that if\nI had Internet access.\n\n346\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.720\nI could recover it.\n\n347\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.610\nSo if I saw a list of URLs here,\nespecially ones that had been deleted, or\n\n348\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.220\nwere in some of the IE or appropriate\nbrowser cache data that may have been\n\n349\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.360\nobfuscated, somebody tried to remove them,\nI can go in and pull those out.\n\n350\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.886\nAnd we'll talk about how to do that in\nthe operating system forensics discussions\n\n351\n00:16:57.886 --> 00:17:00.199\nthat are coming up later,\nwhere we walk you through.\n\n352\n00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:04.377\nWhere are those cache directories based on\nbrowser type, and how do I get into them?\n\n353\n00:17:04.377 --> 00:17:05.680\nWhere are the DAT files, right?\n\n354\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.460\nAnd stuff like that.\n\n355\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.810\nWe'll talk about that, but\nwe can see all that here.\n\n356\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.210\nMaybe there are links here.\n\n357\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.835\nMaybe there are saved games,\nvideos, pictures, right?\n\n358\n00:17:12.835 --> 00:17:13.625\nLike we talked about.\n\n359\n00:17:13.625 --> 00:17:17.625\nNothing there, but you can imagine what\nkind of stuff we would find here, right?\n\n360\n00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:21.475\nSo I could do all that, I could do that\nby the way for every user on the system.\n\n361\n00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.367\nNotice I have, you know as we do,\nprofiles for every user and\n\n362\n00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:27.857\nI can go through and I would be able\nto see any of that kind of information.\n\n363\n00:17:27.857 --> 00:17:30.910\nLet me just bring this back up here for\njust a moment.\n\n364\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.176\nWent into users.\n\n365\n00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.400\nDelved in there.\n\n366\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.270\nBut I got program files,\nI got all sorts of stuff here.\n\n367\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.260\nI've also got lost files\nthat may have been there but\n\n368\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.562\nhave been somehow either removed or\nhave been hidden or\n\n369\n00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:46.940\nperhaps file remnants from\ninstallations prior to my installation.\n\n370\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.030\nYou never know what they are.\n\n371\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.437\nSo I've got some stuff here.\n\n372\n00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:53.216\nThere's some sort of PNG file\nthat may be here, right there.\n\n373\n00:17:53.216 --> 00:17:55.490\nIt looks like it is our Twitter logo,\nright?\n\n374\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.290\nSo maybe that's a Twitter logo.\n\n375\n00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.680\nMaybe it's a file that's been\nstenographically modified.\n\n376\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.730\nWe'll talk about stenography\nin upcoming conversations.\n\n377\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.041\nMaybe that image file, in other words,\nactually has secret data hidden it and\n\n378\n00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:09.567\nwe would have to use the stenography\ntool to decipher that.\n\n379\n00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:12.380\nAnd we would now have the image,\nthe ability to recover it, and\n\n380\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.640\nthen forensically examine\nit as a separate step.\n\n381\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.750\nSo this is the thought process\nthat we're going through.\n\n382\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.590\nAnd notice I can choose to recover that,\nright?\n\n383\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.850\nClick recover.\n\n384\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.090\nSpecify where I want to put it,\n\n385\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.720\nright just throw it out there on\nthe desktop or wherever I do that.\n\n386\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.780\nSpecify it's there.\n\n387\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.780\nAnd then share your recovery experience\nwith your friends on social media.\n\n388\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.190\nSo I could do that.\n\n389\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.123\nAnd I know it's hard to see,\nit's kind of so\n\n390\n00:18:38.123 --> 00:18:41.590\ndark against the background that it's\nhiding there, but it's right there.\n\n391\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.369\nAnd so I can go in and perhaps I could,\n\n392\n00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:48.180\nlet's just see if we can preview that,\nwhere is?\n\n393\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.460\nWhat am I looking for?\n\n394\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.715\nOpen with, there we go, whoops,\ngot my mouse cord out of my way there.\n\n395\n00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:58.655\nOpen with, and do open with photos, right?\n\n396\n00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:01.155\nAnd maybe I'll get the data there.\n\n397\n00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:02.625\nRemember it was a black image so\n\n398\n00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:05.435\non a black background I won't see\nanything.a So, but you get the idea.\n\n399\n00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:07.520\nI can open it up and I would be able to.\n\n400\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.780\nI'd have to change that.\n\n401\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.630\nLet's assume for\na minute I recovered this one.\n\n402\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.440\nThis is another image I have on the\ndesktop that I recovered that I just put\n\n403\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.580\nout there cuz it was easy to\nsee cuz of the background.\n\n404\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.980\nAnd imagine that's the Twitter logo.\n\n405\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.540\nThe file is there,\nit's just that black on black background.\n\n406\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Black on black, yeah.\n\n407\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.970\n&gt;&gt; You can't see it, so\nI'd have to go in and modify the settings.\n\n408\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.090\nBut you get the idea, right?\n\n409\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.990\nI could recover it.\n\n410\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.940\nI'd be able to see this.\n\n411\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.340\nAnd then I could go out and examine this.\n\n412\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.140\nMaybe this is, as I said,\na steganographically modified image.\n\n413\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.190\nMaybe there is something hiding in\nthe bits there around the tree.\n\n414\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.400\nAnd maybe I'd go in and parse that with\nstenographically, a stenographic reader or\n\n415\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.800\na file viewer and\nI can see what's going on.\n\n416\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.530\nSo I'm gonna show you some of that,\nand not that specifically,\n\n417\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.360\nbut concepts like that in just a minute.\n\n418\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.900\nI wonder if I open it in Paint,\nif that would allow us to see.\n\n419\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.930\nLet's just try that real quick.\n\n420\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.350\n&gt;&gt; You'd probably get a better.\n\n421\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.540\n&gt;&gt; May or may not.\n\n422\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.030\nThere we go, yeah so\nthat's a little better.\n\n423\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.320\nSo yeah you could see I just was able to\nrecover the image and its right there.\n\n424\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.640\nSo I could see it but the idea is\nwe've already seen it in the preview.\n\n425\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.560\nWhat we would wanna do is now\nexamine this with a separate\n\n426\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.210\nset of tools to see if there is any\nsteganography, right, that's been applied.\n\n427\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.720\nBut just showing you I could\neasily recover the data.\n\n428\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.110\nI could recover the file just\nby doing that, all right?\n\n429\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.890\nSo, we could do that,\nit wouldn't be to difficult.\n\n430\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.540\nLet's put that back, just over here so\nwe kind of know it's there but\n\n431\n00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.410\nout of the way.\n\n432\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.010\nSo I could use a tool\nlike this to go through.\n\n433\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.700\nAnd you can see there's\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n434\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.030\nLost files down on the raw partition here.\n\n435\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.910\nI've got all sorts of different files.\n\n436\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.730\nI've got GIF graphic\nfiles that were found.\n\n437\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.570\nI got CAB files,\nShockwave Flash files, icon files.\n\n438\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.550\nI, mean, who knows what they are, but I\nseem to have a lot of stuff there, right?\n\n439\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.760\nSo whatever it is.\n\n440\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.010\nThis is a little,\nI don't know, diamond or dot.\n\n441\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.610\nWho knows what that is, right?\n\n442\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.760\nBut I got some bitmap files here.\n\n443\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.800\nAgain, who knows what there are.\n\n444\n00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.430\nThere may or\nmay not be a preview available.\n\n445\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.230\nI may have to go in and\nactually recover them.\n\n446\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.460\nSome files may not be\npreviewed with the viewer.\n\n447\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.484\nAnd this is something you run\ninto sometimes with tools.\n\n448\n00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:57.290\nWe have standard viewer decoders and\nextensions, right?\n\n449\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.670\nAnd these tools for this kind of stuff,\n\n450\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.930\nbut sometimes the files just don't\nlend themselves to be in preview.\n\n451\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.485\nMaybe they're fragments of files.\n\n452\n00:21:03.485 --> 00:21:05.150\nThey're not fully formed.\n\n453\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.655\nAnd I may have some data I can work with.\n\n454\n00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:08.480\nAnd maybe its not the full file.\n\n455\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.840\nSo when you can't preview something, it\nusually means the data is damaged in some\n\n456\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.610\nway or we don't have the right\nviewer associated with the tool.\n\n457\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.730\nTypically bitmap is not\ngonna be a viewer issue.\n\n458\n00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.090\nIt's a standard image type, right?\n\n459\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.320\nYou could probably preview it.\n\n460\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.090\nWhat that means probably is that\nit's probably a fragment of data.\n\n461\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.480\nIt's not the full image.\n\n462\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.220\nIt's quote unquote corrupted.\n\n463\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.230\nNot that we couldn't recover and look\nat it, but we would need special tools.\n\n464\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.370\nMaybe a hex editor, a file viewer or\nsomething like that\n\n465\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.350\nto go in with more depth and\nmore clarity and recover the data.\n\n466\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.830\nSo there's different tools we\nbring to bear here, right?\n\n467\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.790\nAnd try to use.\n\n468\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.950\nSo you can see I've got all sorts\nof different stuff here, right?\n\n469\n00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.990\nThere's an HTM file,\nI don't know what that is, right?\n\n470\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.820\nMay be able to preview that,\nnot a lot of interesting stuff there.\n\n471\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.840\nA lot of code.\n\n472\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.970\nBut you never know what's\nhiding in the code, right?\n\n473\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.420\nAgain, somebody may have\nput all sorts of stuff,\n\n474\n00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.370\nmaybe an account number has been\nsmuggled into that code and\n\n475\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.600\nevery fourth character is a part\nof the number for five lines.\n\n476\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.900\nAnd I would have to know that and then go\nout and pull that out to understand that.\n\n477\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.380\nThere's all these different things\npeople will do in order to hide data.\n\n478\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.930\nI mean, who would look at a file\nlike this, pull it up, and\n\n479\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.980\nnotice that there is an account number\nin there unless we had an indication of\n\n480\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.930\nthe fact that something was different,\nwas just askew, that wasn't right.\n\n481\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.955\nI mean, you may suspect it, but reality,\nwould you look at that file and\n\n482\n00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:23.190\nhave any indication there is\nsomething going on that's funny?\n\n483\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.430\nProblem?\nWould you even find that file?\n\n484\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a recovered file\n\n485\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.320\non the raw partition on the space of the\ndrive that we don't even see traditionally\n\n486\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.520\nwith most file viewers.\n\n487\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.580\nMeaning using the Windows Explorer\ninterface, I wouldn't even see that file.\n\n488\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.248\nIt doesn't even exist as far\nas I know on the hard drive.\n\n489\n00:22:36.248 --> 00:22:39.232\nThe only way to recover it would\nbe with a tool like this, and\n\n490\n00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:42.870\nthe chances of us knowing as\nan investigator to look at that file?\n\n491\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.810\nSlim to none, unless we had a reason to.\n\n492\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.080\nWould a bad actor try to\nsecret into that file?\n\n493\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.930\nMaybe, maybe not that file,\nmaybe other ones.\n\n494\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.640\nBut is it likely?\n\n495\n00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.040\nIt's very likely, right?\n\n496\n00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.820\nSo that's my point.\n\n497\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.730\nYou just don't know.\n\n498\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.800\nEverything you look at has to be looked at\n\n499\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.675\nwith a kind of suspicious eye because\nit's quite possible that in this\n\n500\n00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:05.050\n10,000 plus character stream of data\nthat we're just looking at here.\n\n501\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.110\nI mean,\nlook at all the stuff that's in here.\n\n502\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.530\nLooks just like an htm file.\n\n503\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.570\nI mean, there's no reason\nto think that's different.\n\n504\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.770\nBut there very well may be stuff in there.\n\n505\n00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.340\nAnd this is one of the reasons why we\nneed computer aided search tools, right?\n\n506\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.440\nHumans parsing that file,\ngood luck, right?\n\n507\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.240\nYou're never gonna find anything\nthat is in any way meaningful\n\n508\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.640\nunless you trip across and somebody\npoints you out and says look right here,\n\n509\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.620\nthis line, this is what you're looking at.\n\n510\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.850\nYou a computer aided tool that's gonna\ngo through and do a string search,\n\n511\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.950\na character search, a Boolean search,\nwhatever the case maybe\n\n512\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.690\nbased on parameters you put in it's gonna\nlook for patterns that are not obvious.\n\n513\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.850\nAnd this is one of the things we have to\ndo as forensic investigators is think\n\n514\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.320\nabout this and think about not just the\nmindset of the person who's attempting to\n\n515\n00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.010\nhide their activity, but where would they\nhave done it under what circumstances?\n\n516\n00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.740\nAnd as a result, how would I then\nreconstruct that data to make it readable?\n\n517\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.370\nThis is the kind of thing that tools\nlike this are going to help us do.\n\n518\n00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.170\nWe just simply load up\nthe file that we want to scan.\n\n519\n00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.260\nSo in other words,\nlet me Exit out of here,\n\n520\n00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.450\nlet me show you how,\nby the way before I do that.\n\n521\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.394\nLet me just go back,\nexport the scan status.\n\n522\n00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:08.487\nSo, you can see here I can grab this,\nI could export this out.\n\n523\n00:24:08.487 --> 00:24:12.903\nI save this as an RSF file, recovery\nstate file is the extension that's used.\n\n524\n00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:19.448\nSo, if I go ahead and I do this,\njust click Save, that will export it out.\n\n525\n00:24:19.448 --> 00:24:22.320\nNow, I could just load it up the next\ntime I load the tool if I want to.\n\n526\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.140\nSo if I go back to Home area here,\njust to show you,\n\n527\n00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.340\nthis is what the tool looks\nlike when we load it up.\n\n528\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.920\nAll file types that we wanna scan, right?\n\n529\n00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.196\nSo we just check off what we want, Audio,\n\n530\n00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:38.640\nVideo, etc., and click Next.\n\n531\n00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.820\nSpecify what drive I wanna scan.\n\n532\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.180\nSo the trick with tools like this, and\nthey tell you this when you go to install,\n\n533\n00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.380\nwhich is why I have a secondary hard\ndrive as you can see mounted here.\n\n534\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.870\nA drive E and all of my forensics tools\nwill be installed into drive E for\n\n535\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.510\nall of our demonstrations, just so you\nknow, on this particular machine anyway,\n\n536\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.280\nor the equivalent on whatever\nmachine we're using, traditionally.\n\n537\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.141\nThe tools will tell you,\n\n538\n00:24:59.141 --> 00:25:02.066\nespecially with the data recovery tools in\nparticular very important to know this.\n\n539\n00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:05.500\nThat you don't want to install\nthem on the same system,\n\n540\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.727\non the same drive that you\nwant to scan for recovery.\n\n541\n00:25:08.727 --> 00:25:13.091\nBecause the tool itself will influence the\nrecovery and can lead to corrupt data and\n\n542\n00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:17.455\nincomplete verification of data, and\nas a result, incomplete searches.\n\n543\n00:25:17.455 --> 00:25:21.035\nAnd so you must install the tool onto\na separate drive and then run it.\n\n544\n00:25:21.035 --> 00:25:24.752\nSo you may install it on typically\nan external thumb drive or\n\n545\n00:25:24.752 --> 00:25:26.512\nsomething like that,\nrun it against the system,\n\n546\n00:25:26.512 --> 00:25:30.012\nif the system has a secondary\npartition as I created here.\n\n547\n00:25:30.012 --> 00:25:33.402\nVirtual machine, easy to do, just mount\nanother hard drive, right, another VHD.\n\n548\n00:25:33.402 --> 00:25:36.472\nNo big deal, install it there, and\nthen run it against the C drive,\n\n549\n00:25:36.472 --> 00:25:37.772\nwhich is what I did, right?\n\n550\n00:25:37.772 --> 00:25:38.572\nSo we can do that.\n\n551\n00:25:38.572 --> 00:25:39.762\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n552\n00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:43.162\nBut you never wanna scan the partition\nthat the tools actually resonating with\n\n553\n00:25:43.162 --> 00:25:44.032\nany of these tools.\n\n554\n00:25:44.032 --> 00:25:45.655\nThat leads to a lot of problems,\njust so you know.\n\n555\n00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:49.940\nAll right, so we scan that,\nright, we just click Scan there.\n\n556\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.910\nIt goes out and\nstarts to scan and does that.\n\n557\n00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.850\nA quick scan, a very, very simple scan,\ndoesn't take very long, as you can see.\n\n558\n00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.590\nIt's not going to take very long at all,\nit's almost done.\n\n559\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.030\nBut it's not gonna find very much,\ntraditionally, right?\n\n560\n00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.170\nDoes the initial scan, you'll see,\n\n561\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.180\nall that stuff I was just looking at\nthat I showed before is not there.\n\n562\n00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.050\nYou have to run what is\ncalled a deep scan, right?\n\n563\n00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.203\nAnd the deep scan, which is right down\nhere, is gonna be a thorough scan that\n\n564\n00:26:13.203 --> 00:26:16.240\nreally goes by byte by byte,\nsector by sector, does everything.\n\n565\n00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.427\nThat takes, depending on the size\nof the drive, can take hours.\n\n566\n00:26:18.427 --> 00:26:21.530\nBut one that I did, which is why I\npre-loaded it for us to look at,\n\n567\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.117\ntook about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n568\n00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:25.636\nSo it could take a while, and\nthis is not a very big hard drive.\n\n569\n00:26:25.636 --> 00:26:27.390\nWe'll kick it off just to show you, right?\n\n570\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.782\nBut deep scan starts automatically.\n\n571\n00:26:29.782 --> 00:26:32.290\nWait, so it's just gonna go do it's thing.\n\n572\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.640\nAnd you'll notice it's\nparsing the files there, but\n\n573\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.390\nit is gonna take some time for it to run.\n\n574\n00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.390\nWe're not gonna wait for it to run.\n\n575\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.319\nWe're just gonna let it\nrun in the background.\n\n576\n00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:42.780\nBut you will see that it's gonna\ntake a while for it to run.\n\n577\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.858\nSo just so you know, about 22 minutes or\nso is what it's estimating.\n\n578\n00:26:45.858 --> 00:26:49.638\nAnd it's starting to produce all the files\nand the stuff that we were looking at that\n\n579\n00:26:49.638 --> 00:26:52.177\nwe saw in the prior scan, but\nit takes a while to do that.\n\n580\n00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.166\nOkay, so I'm gonna stop the scan.\n\n581\n00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:55.920\nWe're not gonna have that run, right?\n\n582\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.290\nJust wanted you to see that.\n\n583\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.620\nJust so you know, Scan and Stop doesn't\nreally give us much of anything.\n\n584\n00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.330\nBut one thing that will\nbecome important later\n\n585\n00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.780\nwhen we are talking about operating\nsystem forensics in Windows,\n\n586\n00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.780\nfor instance, is access to the pagefile or\nthe swap file.\n\n587\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.220\nAnd you'll notice that one of the things\nthat we do get recoverability off here\n\n588\n00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.710\nwith a deep scan is the pagefile and\nthe swap file.\n\n589\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.230\nAnd we could then load those into a tool\nthat will allow us to examine them.\n\n590\n00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.169\nRemember, page and swap files\nare the state of dynamic memory.\n\n591\n00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:26.610\nIn other words,\nthe volatile data in the system.\n\n592\n00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.990\nThis is how we do memory dumps or\none of the ways we do memory dumps.\n\n593\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.420\nWe do a tool or examine this information,\nlooking at the current state\n\n594\n00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.010\nof the volatile data in the pagefile at\nthe time we encumber that machine and\n\n595\n00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.540\ngrabbed it for evidence.\n\n596\n00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.787\nAnd the pagefile will be\nresonant on the drive.\n\n597\n00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:47.946\nIf we don't shut down that machine and we\ncapture the image before we shut it down,\n\n598\n00:27:47.946 --> 00:27:49.573\nwe have a copy of the pagefile and\n\n599\n00:27:49.573 --> 00:27:53.290\nthe swap file in the dynamic memory\nspaces as part of that data dump.\n\n600\n00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.402\nWe could then examine them offline.\n\n601\n00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:58.545\nAnd this is how we actually get and\nparse the pagefile and the swap files, and\n\n602\n00:27:58.545 --> 00:28:00.610\nthen can load them into an editor.\n\n603\n00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.160\nEither a hex editor or whatever we're\ngonna use and understand what's in memory.\n\n604\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.910\nThis is how we do those memory dump\nthings that we keep talking about.\n\n605\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.080\nWe have process dumps,\nwe can get all the kinda stuff from there.\n\n606\n00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.320\nBut I just wanted to show you that one of\nthe things that this recovery tool does\n\n607\n00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.740\nis gives us access to those kinda files,\nwhich is very important.\n\n608\n00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.002\nWe're just gonna go ahead and we\nare going to close out of that the tool.\n\n609\n00:28:21.002 --> 00:28:23.630\nWe've already saved our search, so\nwe don't need to worry about that.\n\n610\n00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:29.270\nWanna bring up the PowerBin [COUGH] tool,\nour tool for case management.\n\n611\n00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.200\nOne of the tools we use to create a case.\n\n612\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.055\nA case is defined as\ninformation we're gonna gather.\n\n613\n00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:37.560\nWe talked about artifacts, things that\nwe're gonna add to the case file.\n\n614\n00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.470\nA case is simply gonna be\na collection of evidence,\n\n615\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.770\nartifacts we find through examination,\n\n616\n00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.905\nput into a forensically sound tool\nusing forensically sound methodologies.\n\n617\n00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:51.850\nThe EnCase tool, the E-N-C-A-S-E,\nThe PowerBin examiner tool,\n\n618\n00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.710\na tool like this, all of these\nare essentially gonna work the same way.\n\n619\n00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.974\nThe Autopsy tool, the FTK tool,\nthese are all tools and you'll see me\n\n620\n00:28:57.974 --> 00:29:01.420\ndemonstrate most of them throughout\nour discussions in later episodes.\n\n621\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.798\nI'll use Autopsy to go through and\n\n622\n00:29:03.798 --> 00:29:08.390\ntake a look at some aspects of data\nmanagement and the mobile area.\n\n623\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.302\nWe'll use mobile edit or\nmobile forensics tools.\n\n624\n00:29:10.302 --> 00:29:13.170\nThose kind of case management tools,\nwhatever they are.\n\n625\n00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.060\nSo in this case,\nwe're using the PowerBin commander tool.\n\n626\n00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.139\nWe're gonna go in.\nI've already opened a case.\n\n627\n00:29:17.139 --> 00:29:19.995\nI'll back out of that and\nlike I just did with the other tool,\n\n628\n00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:23.200\nshow you how to set it up after we\ntake a look at the data I've loaded.\n\n629\n00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.380\nCuz again, it takes a lot of search\nall these stuff and find it.\n\n630\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.730\nSo I've gone ahead and I've loaded up\nan image and I've searched the image.\n\n631\n00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.830\nAnd you can see, I've got a bunch\nof different stuff in here.\n\n632\n00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.800\nI've got a bunch of, in this case,\nPNG files that I found, JPEG files etc.\n\n633\n00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.240\nSo I'm looking at images,\nand I've highlighted one.\n\n634\n00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.319\nAnd I've looked at down\nhere under General,\n\n635\n00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:44.760\nthere's 300 files over 300\nfiles that I've found.\n\n636\n00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.370\nIf we can go full screen, so\nyou could see this please.\n\n637\n00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.280\nI'm showing you,\nI've got over 300 files here.\n\n638\n00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.270\nAnd you could see that I've got\na bunch of different files.\n\n639\n00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.640\nUnder General, I've got the size\nof the file, the check sum.\n\n640\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.080\nGot just general information\nabout it on the Properties tab.\n\n641\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.150\nDown here under Thumbnails,\n\n642\n00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.040\nI could see all the different\nkinds of files that I found.\n\n643\n00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.550\nSo a thumbnail sketch of every one\nof the 315 files is available to me.\n\n644\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:13.030\nI'm looking at xClouds2, so\nI'm looking at one of these over here.\n\n645\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.840\nI can actually see the file view itself,\nso\n\n646\n00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.960\nwhich file I'm actually\nlooking at a preview, right.\n\n647\n00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.850\nI could see a representation\nof the text view of the files.\n\n648\n00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.326\nSo I could see the scrambled code in it.\n\n649\n00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:24.276\nI could see the extracted text view.\n\n650\n00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:26.018\nThere's really no text\ncuz it's a PNG file.\n\n651\n00:30:26.018 --> 00:30:27.760\nSo there's really nothing to extract.\n\n652\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.630\nI could see the hex view of the file.\n\n653\n00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.210\nThis is a more advanced tool with\nmore advanced editing capabilities.\n\n654\n00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.150\nSo I could see a lot of additional data,\nright.\n\n655\n00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.840\nI could see the file stack text view.\n\n656\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.850\nIn other words,\nall the information around this file.\n\n657\n00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.564\nAnd I can see the hex view\nof the files stack, right.\n\n658\n00:30:42.564 --> 00:30:46.120\nSo I can look at different\ninformation in different ways.\n\n659\n00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.460\nI could use a hex editor\nto examine the tool,\n\n660\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.525\nsteganographic viewer to see if there\nis steganography applied to the file.\n\n661\n00:30:51.525 --> 00:30:54.040\nThere's all sorts of stuff I could do.\n\n662\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.844\nAnd so I can do reports on what I've found\non generator report here in a minute,\n\n663\n00:30:57.844 --> 00:31:00.802\ndo a key word search,\nan advance search, search for files.\n\n664\n00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:05.350\nI could jump to and add additional\nitems I can bookmark information here.\n\n665\n00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.560\nNotice, I have a hash area down here.\n\n666\n00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.230\nI can look at hashes if\nthey've been created, right.\n\n667\n00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.320\nRemember, we talked about\nthe value of creating hashes.\n\n668\n00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.430\nSo if I wanna generate a report,\nwhat kind of report do I wanna generate?\n\n669\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.560\nAnd I could see the example of what\nkind of the report would look like.\n\n670\n00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.765\nSimple text report in RTF,\nCSV an HTML evidence summary.\n\n671\n00:31:24.765 --> 00:31:28.160\nMalware scan result,\nif I wanna find if there is malware there,\n\n672\n00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.250\ndo an HTML investigative report,\nopen the report on finish.\n\n673\n00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.349\nSave current wizard options as default,\nright, so I could specify that.\n\n674\n00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:38.415\nSo I could go ahead,\njust open it up, click Next,\n\n675\n00:31:38.415 --> 00:31:41.055\nput in the Investigator's name, right?\n\n676\n00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:47.139\nSo I'll put in my name,\nwhat company I work for, ITProTV.\n\n677\n00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:51.470\nWhat Phone number, Fax.\n\n678\n00:31:55.254 --> 00:31:57.630\nCuz you can't do this without your facts,\nright?\n\n679\n00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.740\nSo I'll put this kind of information in,\n\n680\n00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.690\nwhatever the case may be in terms\nof just the address information.\n\n681\n00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.260\nThis is all optional, of course, right?\n\n682\n00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.894\nI don't need to add any of this.\n\n683\n00:32:07.894 --> 00:32:11.118\nBut remember, if I'm gonna generate\nthis report and give it to a client,\n\n684\n00:32:11.118 --> 00:32:14.706\nI probably wanna have this information in\nthere because the client's gonna wanna\n\n685\n00:32:14.706 --> 00:32:16.113\nknow who generated the report.\n\n686\n00:32:16.113 --> 00:32:16.731\nTo what end?\n\n687\n00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:18.779\nSo I'm gonna do that, click Next.\n\n688\n00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:23.304\nInclude only data checked as includes\nreports, include all file system evidence\n\n689\n00:32:23.304 --> 00:32:27.250\nfiles, right, don't include item files,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n690\n00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.810\nSo I could specify what I want.\n\n691\n00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.690\nI can include any and all things right.\n\n692\n00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:37.910\nIf I do all file system evidence, files\nof a selected type or whatever I choose.\n\n693\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.030\nSo I can do all of that, and you can\nsee that I've added everything in here.\n\n694\n00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.010\nI have a default add all that in.\n\n695\n00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.792\nThen you'll specify here what properties\nare the included file seal C, for\n\n696\n00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:52.040\ninstance common file properties,\nsize creation, last access.\n\n697\n00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.861\nThere's other stuff,\nmaybe the name, the directory,\n\n698\n00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:56.710\nthe archive was at a hidden file.\n\n699\n00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.870\nYou have to specify all those things,\nright?\n\n700\n00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.860\nSo I could include all right?\n\n701\n00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:06.120\nI could include you know these HFS file\nproperties if it's an HFS partition.\n\n702\n00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.980\nSo Mac, UNIX/LINUX, FatXFS right?\n\n703\n00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.775\nNTFS.\nYeah you see the idea here right whatever\n\n704\n00:33:12.775 --> 00:33:14.430\nthe case might be.\n\n705\n00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.110\nEXT, right,\nall the different file partition types,\n\n706\n00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:21.770\nfile system types would be included so\nI could specify that.\n\n707\n00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.660\nInclude the attributes, click Next.\n\n708\n00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.820\nInclude only data checked, this includes\nreports, include all types, etc.\n\n709\n00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.390\nSpecify that, do all that,\ninclude case history, I can add that in.\n\n710\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.610\nExport it as a link,\nif I want to do that, great.\n\n711\n00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:41.690\nClick Finish, generate that report, and\nwhen that report is done it opens up.\n\n712\n00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.900\nAnd you'll see that I've\ngot this information.\n\n713\n00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.230\nIt doesn't take very long.\n\n714\n00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.060\nIt trails off.\n\n715\n00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.740\nObviously, we'd have to go through here,\nbut I get a case log with everything.\n\n716\n00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.880\nIt shows me all the information and\nshows me what it is.\n\n717\n00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.370\nIt shows me where I mounted it right here.\n\n718\n00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:03.004\nI went ahead and\nadded this into this right here.\n\n719\n00:34:03.004 --> 00:34:08.270\nDD raw image or whatever the case\nmay be and use that particular file.\n\n720\n00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.630\nThat's the raw image file for DD that\nI was using, that I mounted, right?\n\n721\n00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.370\nSo if I want to then go ahead and\nI want to\n\n722\n00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:19.120\nlook at evidence in particular I can drill\ndown, add evidence in, build out my case.\n\n723\n00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.230\nI could export that evidence out.\n\n724\n00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.420\nI can look at various tools to create\na forensics container to then contain\n\n725\n00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.590\nevidence and forensically mount it\nto make sure that it's isolated.\n\n726\n00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.250\nI have viewers here, so\nI can specify how I wanna view data.\n\n727\n00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.660\nAnd I can go in,\njust general navigation here, and\n\n728\n00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.740\nI can close out,\njust wait while it kind of exits.\n\n729\n00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.310\nAnd if I wanna open this back up just to\nshow you how we would launch the tool,\n\n730\n00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.770\njust give me a moment to do that.\n\n731\n00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.440\nJust have administrative rights,\nso just click yes to do that.\n\n732\n00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.980\nAnd we'll show you quickly\nhow we set this up.\n\n733\n00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.040\nAgain, using a demo version of this so\nactivation for\n\n734\n00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.930\nfull license, we're just gonna activate\nlater, we're not worried about that.\n\n735\n00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:58.680\nJust so you know where that comes from.\n\n736\n00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.030\nYou'll see that in several demonstrations\nthroughout our different episodes,\n\n737\n00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.960\nas we use tools on the Paraben's P2C,\nwhatever version.\n\n738\n00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.550\nWe add evidence here and,\nor open an existing case.\n\n739\n00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:13.020\nAnd or create a new case, so\ncreate a new case, click Next,\n\n740\n00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:18.510\ngive it a case name, ITProTV 2,\nor whatever the case will be.\n\n741\n00:35:21.144 --> 00:35:25.370\nSpecify information here, right,\nyou saw me do this before.\n\n742\n00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.410\nI'll just put some basic\ninformation in there.\n\n743\n00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.376\nSpecify where we're gonna solve,\nor rather store the case, so\n\n744\n00:35:31.376 --> 00:35:35.157\nwhatever working directory we have you'll\nsee it's just in the power bin software\n\n745\n00:35:35.157 --> 00:35:36.199\nfolder on the e drive.\n\n746\n00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:40.020\nSo we're just gonna wait for\nthat to spin up, takes just a moment.\n\n747\n00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.630\nAnd then once the case opens I\ncan begin to mount evidence,\n\n748\n00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.330\nyou'll see I have a choice\nof mounting evidence there.\n\n749\n00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:50.080\nAnd I can add different evidence in,\nI can add in logical drives or folders.\n\n750\n00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.760\nI can add in a physical drive, I can add\nin an image file, an email database,\n\n751\n00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.730\na chat database, the registry of a system,\nI can add the registry file.\n\n752\n00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.680\nWe'll do a whole deep dive on\nthe registry in the operating system\n\n753\n00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.665\nforensics conversation.\n\n754\n00:36:02.665 --> 00:36:06.555\nAbout different registry keys we may\nwanna look at for a variety of things so\n\n755\n00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:08.025\nwe may wanna load that.\n\n756\n00:36:08.025 --> 00:36:11.185\nInternet browser data can\nload the Firefox, Chrome and\n\n757\n00:36:11.185 --> 00:36:15.375\nInternet Explorer cache data,\nmentioned that so that may be important.\n\n758\n00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:18.105\nGame console data,\nthere's a big one these days, right?\n\n759\n00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:22.265\nI can load you'll see there the FAT\npartition of FAT X from Xbox.\n\n760\n00:36:22.265 --> 00:36:25.475\nI can load in Playstation partitions.\n\n761\n00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:26.730\nAll sorts of stuff, again.\n\n762\n00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.580\nWhile we don't often think about it\ndo people store data in that stuff?\n\n763\n00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.490\nAbsolutely.\nIs there stuff you could hack\n\n764\n00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.770\ninto that's stored that you may not want\npeople to see but could be found there?\n\n765\n00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.660\nYeah, for smart investigators\nwe definitely know about that.\n\n766\n00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.570\nTools like this would allow us to do that.\n\n767\n00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:45.380\nMobile data, we can use things like\nthe iTunes data on a device to see that.\n\n768\n00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.440\nWe can load all sorts of stuff here,\nright?\n\n769\n00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.190\nSo if I wanted to load let's\nsay maybe the C drive, right?\n\n770\n00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.040\nI could load that up like you saw me do.\n\n771\n00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.830\nAnd I can mount that, and or\nI can load a physical device,\n\n772\n00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:03.380\nI could load an image file if I have\nthat DD file that I wanted to load.\n\n773\n00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.250\nRight, auto-detect an image and\nload that up.\n\n774\n00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.350\nThere's my test raw image that\nI was just loading, right?\n\n775\n00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.700\nClick OK, it's gonna load up,\nspecify what I want.\n\n776\n00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.370\nThis is how I created the data\ncapture we were just looking at.\n\n777\n00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.610\nI just loaded up an image from\nthe imaging tool that I used, and\n\n778\n00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.550\nthen was just able to parse that.\n\n779\n00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.030\nAnd so I might want to calculate hashes,\nit'll do that.\n\n780\n00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.350\nIndex keywords, extract indexed\ntext from graphic files, OCR,\n\n781\n00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:31.040\na little Optical Character Recognition,\nwhat language am I going to use.\n\n782\n00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.480\nAlways scan for malware,\nimportant to do that.\n\n783\n00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.070\nSo we don't infect ourselves.\n\n784\n00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.640\nAnd then what kind of data\nanalysis do I want to do?\n\n785\n00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.980\nAm I looking at chat databases,\ndisc images, Internet Explorer, et cetera.\n\n786\n00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.500\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n787\n00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.200\nI'm gonna sort that, perform data\nanalysis and deleted data, right.\n\n788\n00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.940\nSo whatever the case may be.\n\n789\n00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.460\nDo all that, and then load that up,\nspecify how intense I want this to be,\n\n790\n00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.110\nwhat kind of filtering and resolution\nI want for recovered graphics files.\n\n791\n00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.870\nAnd then let it go off and do its thing.\n\n792\n00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.240\nIt's gonna take a while to load,\nbut it will then load up the data.\n\n793\n00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.945\nThat's how I got the data stack\nthat I was analyzing, and\n\n794\n00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:07.005\nshowing you when I actually was walking\nthrough the tool a few minutes ago.\n\n795\n00:38:07.005 --> 00:38:10.795\nI walked in, set up this case, loaded\nup sample data through an image, and\n\n796\n00:38:10.795 --> 00:38:11.565\nthen made it available.\n\n797\n00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:15.405\nSo this is how you would start out and\nactually load the tool up and\n\n798\n00:38:15.405 --> 00:38:18.845\ncreate a case, and once we have the case\nfile this is what we would work on.\n\n799\n00:38:18.845 --> 00:38:21.870\nRemember that image,\nis the forensically sound.\n\n800\n00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.370\nCopy that we made with the write\nblocker that we used from the source\n\n801\n00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.450\nthat's got the integrity check on it,\nthe hash that we talked about.\n\n802\n00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.450\nThat can be safely used because\nit's a secondary, third,\n\n803\n00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.870\nfourth, or fifth whatever\ngeneration copy of the original,\n\n804\n00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.300\nvalidated with the hash\nto ensure it's identical.\n\n805\n00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.329\nWe're using the copy as opposed to\nthe original in order to interrogate and\n\n806\n00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:41.987\nfind that data that we want to search for\nhere as an investigator.\n\n807\n00:38:41.987 --> 00:38:47.890\n&gt;&gt; Well Adam it is the tools of the trade\nthat help us actually perform our job.\n\n808\n00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.190\nI know we have to understand the theory.\n\n809\n00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.830\nWe have to understand all\nthe legalities behind performing\n\n810\n00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.130\nforensic investigation on a computer or\ndigital systems.\n\n811\n00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.880\nBut the tools is what make it.\n\n812\n00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.905\nThe tools is what makes it cool,\nfun, and actually doable.\n\n813\n00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:05.330\nCuz as you said there is\ngoing to be a lot of data.\n\n814\n00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.370\nThat us as humans just would not\nbe able to parse through and\n\n815\n00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.940\ndiscover a good evidence because of\njust the, the immense amount of it.\n\n816\n00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.520\nSo these tools are very awesome.\n\n817\n00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.484\nAnd they are fun to play with.\n\n818\n00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:17.600\nThey are definitely what draws us in.\n\n819\n00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.560\nIt's the attractive part of getting\ninto forensics, right, being able\n\n820\n00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.230\nto play with the cool stuff, and\nfinding that evidence, and being the guy.\n\n821\n00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.570\nIt's like yeah, here's the smoking gun.\n\n822\n00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.150\nAnd I use this awesome neat little\ngadget right here to make that happen.\n\n823\n00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.990\nThat's what brings us to the game, but\n\n824\n00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:34.910\nwe do have to round that knowledge out\nwith all the theoretical stuff as well.\n\n825\n00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.442\nVery cool demonstrations,\nwe appreciate you joining us today and\n\n826\n00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:41.983\nshowing us how we can use these\ndevices in our daily lives as CHFIs.\n\n827\n00:39:41.983 --> 00:39:45.925\n[LAUGH] There's the thumbs\nup from Adam Gordon.\n\n828\n00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.585\nAll right everyone,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n829\n00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.285\nHopefully you got a lot out\nof these demonstrations.\n\n830\n00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:51.740\nWe hope that you did.\n\n831\n00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.920\nWe do hope that you'll join us for\nthe rest of the series as well,\n\n832\n00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.120\nthat being said it's time for\n\n833\n00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.430\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n834\n00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.620\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n835\n00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n836\n00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:05.722\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n837\n00:40:05.722 --> 00:40:07.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n838\n00:40:07.658 --> 00:40:10.216\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.716\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:16.384\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.400\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.720\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe're returning with more CHFI version 9.\n\n8\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.121\nSo hopefully that's what you tuned in for,\ncuz that's what we're doing.\n\n9\n00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:28.269\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\nagain to help us with that endeavor,\n\n10\n00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.350\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.033\nAdam, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.627\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, I feel like I'm supposed\nto be running out into the ring or\n\n13\n00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:36.051\nsomething with that introduction.\n\n14\n00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam Gordon!\n\n15\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.696\nCue the pyro.\n\n16\n00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:42.914\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, see, we need that.\n\n17\n00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:44.600\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I've been saying.\n\n18\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.201\n&gt;&gt; We gotta get them working on it,\ninstead of the whole-\n\n19\n00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.798\n&gt;&gt; Phil Born quit buying new stuff for\n\n20\n00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:49.520\nthe building.\n\n21\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.486\n&gt;&gt; Just do the pyro, that's so\nmuch more impressive.\n\n22\n00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.920\n&gt;&gt; Give me one show with pyro.\n\n23\n00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.730\n&gt;&gt; We'd have to be outside.\n\n24\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't be in the studio, probably.\n\n25\n00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:57.795\nIt would end poorly for everybody.\n\n26\n00:00:57.795 --> 00:00:58.985\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Still be awesome.\n\n27\n00:00:58.985 --> 00:00:59.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would be.\n\n28\n00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.025\nAll right, so we are here to continue\nour conversations around CHFI,\n\n29\n00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:06.024\nspecifically in this particular\ngroup of conversations.\n\n30\n00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.370\nIt will be a group, do not kid yourselves,\nwe call them a gaggle when we talk about\n\n31\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.060\ngeese, it will be a gaggle\nof conversations here.\n\n32\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.090\nAround hard disks and file systems,\nactually a very long and very,\n\n33\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.610\nvery involved topic, in the sense that\nwe're gonna cover a lot of material.\n\n34\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.580\nWe're gonna talk all about hard drives,\n\n35\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.000\nstorage mediums in general, talk about\nfile systems, how do the Windows,\n\n36\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.680\nMacintosh, and Linux OSes boot up,\nwhat's the boot process on them.\n\n37\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.750\nHow do we go through and use some tools,\nlike the sleuth toolkit,\n\n38\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.042\nTSK, like Autopsy, WinHex,\na hex editor, how do we use those tools\n\n39\n00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:41.342\nto be able to start to understand\nwhat's lurking on our hard drives.\n\n40\n00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:45.446\nHow are we gonna see what's there, how are\nwe gonna recover forensically data that\n\n41\n00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:47.450\nmay or may not be evident at first blush.\n\n42\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.830\nWe're gonna go through and show you some\nhands-on discussions about that stuff.\n\n43\n00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.064\nIt's always important to take\nthe theory and actuate it,\n\n44\n00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:57.628\nmake it possible and reality for\nyou, in terms of those skills.\n\n45\n00:01:57.628 --> 00:01:59.857\nWe're gonna do that, but\nthat's gonna happen a little bit.\n\n46\n00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:03.614\nBecause first, we've gotta spend some time\nin the next few episodes just talking\n\n47\n00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:06.824\nthrough the logic of all the stuff that\nleads us to the point where we can\n\n48\n00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:08.660\nstart playing with some tools.\n\n49\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.113\nThat's the hard part\nwith some of this stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:13.415\nCuz you wanna jump right in and just go\nand say, hey, let me use that tool and\n\n51\n00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:15.053\ndo the demo and show you what it does.\n\n52\n00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:18.212\nBut then if you don't really understand\nthe logic of it and don't know why we're\n\n53\n00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:21.480\ndoing it, it may not translate in the real\nworld for you for stuff that makes sense.\n\n54\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.470\nAnd equally important, It's not gonna\nmake you a better forensic investigator,\n\n55\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.605\nmake you operate soundly,\nfollowing the rules of evidence, and\n\n56\n00:02:28.605 --> 00:02:31.459\nmake sure you're abiding by\nthem to produce good results.\n\n57\n00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.382\nAnd it's not gonna give you the knowledge\nyou need in order to be able to take and\n\n58\n00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:34.970\npass the exam.\n\n59\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.410\nAny and\nall of those things are very important.\n\n60\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.880\nSo we're gonna do this the right way, and\n\n61\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.779\nthen once we're done with that,\nwe do the fun stuff.\n\n62\n00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.934\nIt's like eating the vegetables\nalong with the cool stuff, so\n\n63\n00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.040\nyou get everything in one bite.\n\n64\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.152\nAll right, so let's start with\nthe obvious stuff, what is a disk drive?\n\n65\n00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:49.790\nWell, we happen to have one\nsitting on the table here.\n\n66\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.852\nBefore we go look at it, or\nwe could look at it right now.\n\n67\n00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:55.207\n[LAUGH] Before we do that, let's just look\nat it for a minute while we're talking.\n\n68\n00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.989\nWhat I was gonna simply ask you is,\nmaybe Dan,\n\n69\n00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.180\nyou can help me out before we talk\nabout the pieces of the hard drive.\n\n70\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.096\nIf I asked you, hey what is a hard drive,\nobviously we can say,\n\n71\n00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:05.307\nwell just point to that,\nand it's that thing.\n\n72\n00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:07.423\nAnd certainly that will be\none way of defining it, but\n\n73\n00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:10.300\nlet's be a little bit more formal,\nwhat do we define a hard drive as?\n\n74\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.922\n&gt;&gt; Sure, a hard drive is basically\na storage space, I would say, for\n\n75\n00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.097\nyour digital files.\n\n76\n00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:17.732\n&gt;&gt; So a storage space, or\na device, since it is a device.\n\n77\n00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:21.581\nA storage device that has the ability\nto store files, as Daniel said,\n\n78\n00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.830\nof a variety of types.\n\n79\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.100\nDigital obviously, but\nthey could be spreadsheets, PowerPoints,\n\n80\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.800\nJPEGs, audio files,\nwho knows what they are.\n\n81\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.600\nBut it's gonna do that, and do that\nusing the technology of the hard drive,\n\n82\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.755\nthat's gonna be either a SSD drive,\nlet's say.\n\n83\n00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:41.626\nSo it may have no moving parts,\nper se, but flash memory, essentially.\n\n84\n00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:46.435\nMaybe it's optical storage that we're\nusing, not a traditional hard drive,\n\n85\n00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:50.910\nbut a disk drive of a type, maybe a CD,\na DVD, a Blu-Ray of some kind.\n\n86\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.279\nMaybe magnetic storage,\n\n87\n00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:56.518\nso floppy disk, tape drives fall into\nthis category, lots of different types.\n\n88\n00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:00.179\nWhen we say a hard drive specifically,\nwe mean an enclosed solution,\n\n89\n00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.700\nmechanical typically, although not always.\n\n90\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.556\nSSD would not be considered mechanical,\nno moving parts.\n\n91\n00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:08.809\nBut an enclosed solution that\ndoes have parts that make it up,\n\n92\n00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.080\nand we wanna talk about the main\ncomponents of the hard drive.\n\n93\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.260\nSo, if we can now go\nspecifically to our hard drive.\n\n94\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.505\nWe might need a little bit of that extra\nlight that you were showing me that we\n\n95\n00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:19.288\nhave access too.\n\n96\n00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:20.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying, it's so dark.\n\n97\n00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:21.763\n&gt;&gt; It is a little dark.\n\n98\n00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:25.350\n&gt;&gt; It looks dark to us, so maybe it's just\nthe fact that I have the dark filter on.\n\n99\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.549\n&gt;&gt; We do, we do.\n\n100\n00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:29.834\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that must be what it is, so,\nhopefully out there, you're able to see,\n\n101\n00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.418\nand we're gonna have Daniel help us.\n\n102\n00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:34.098\nHe's gonna point to some of the parts that\nwe're talking about as we define what they\n\n103\n00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:35.088\nare, just to give you a sense.\n\n104\n00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:38.923\nWhen we think about the hard drive,\nwe could talk about this particular one,\n\n105\n00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:41.460\nyou're not really gonna be\nable to point to per se.\n\n106\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.451\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; You point to the platter, but\n\n107\n00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou can't really point to the cylinders\nand say, look there's a cylinder.\n\n108\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.032\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there's a cylinder, yeah!\n\n109\n00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:47.772\n&gt;&gt; But you could point to the platter, and\n\n110\n00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:50.368\ncertainly we could show you\nwhere cylinders are located.\n\n111\n00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:53.007\nThe cylinders will be within the platter,\nor on the platter,\n\n112\n00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:55.435\nI guess depending on how you\nchoose to think about that.\n\n113\n00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:59.083\nBut they are the circular tracks that\nare present on the platters of the drive\n\n114\n00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.332\nat equal distances from the center,\nwe get into the whole radius and\n\n115\n00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:03.472\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n116\n00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:07.710\nThey form, I think of them anyways,\nforming the barrel-like structure that\n\n117\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.481\ngroups the tracks together\nbetween the platters.\n\n118\n00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:12.254\nWe have multiple platters in a hard drive.\n\n119\n00:05:12.254 --> 00:05:17.700\nThe platter will be as Daniel pointed to,\nthis item right here, this circular item.\n\n120\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.459\nIt is cylindrical, as you can see,\n\n121\n00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.518\nit is going to be coated with\nsome sort of magnetic substrate.\n\n122\n00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:27.210\nA magnetic coating of some kind\nthat allows us to store data.\n\n123\n00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.179\nThere will be the ability to read and\nwrite to and\n\n124\n00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:32.193\nfrom both sides of the platter.\n\n125\n00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:33.709\nSo although you can't see it,\nthere's only one side visible,\n\n126\n00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:34.749\nunderneath the arm that is tracking there,\n\n127\n00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:35.890\nthe other side of the platter\nwould have an arm.\n\n128\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.415\nThat other side of it essentially is\ngonna read and write to and from it.\n\n129\n00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:45.853\nAnd if there's multiple platters stacked\nup, let's say maybe there's ten platters\n\n130\n00:05:45.853 --> 00:05:49.162\nin this drive, unless we took it apart I\nwouldn't know exactly how many are there.\n\n131\n00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:52.890\nBut just in theory, for purposes of our\ndiscussion, let's say there are ten.\n\n132\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.580\nIf that's the case, there would be ten\nplatters, ten arms, that would read and\n\n133\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.130\nwrite between them, kinda stacked up.\n\n134\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.404\nSo you have an arm, and then a platter,\narm, platter, all the way down.\n\n135\n00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:05.780\nAnd then we would have the cylinders\nbeing kind of the cylindrical or\n\n136\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.309\ncore that we would drill through\nall ten at a key point or\n\n137\n00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.470\ncertain point on the platter,\nthe same, all the way down.\n\n138\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.640\nAnd that grouping all the way\ndown will be the cylinder,\n\n139\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.295\nthe circular tracks that are in the same\nplace geographically on the platters as we\n\n140\n00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:24.276\nlook at all of them, read and\nwrite to and from them.\n\n141\n00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:28.124\nThat's why I talked about this idea of\nthat barrel-like structure that is formed\n\n142\n00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:29.417\nby linking them together.\n\n143\n00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.753\nSo that way we can group all\nthe tracks of information together.\n\n144\n00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:37.141\nIf you're an older person, or\nremember phonographic records,\n\n145\n00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:41.140\nif you remember an LP,\nto use the slang of that generation.\n\n146\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.800\nIf you remember records in their\ntraditional form, wax disks that you would\n\n147\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.477\nput on a record player, have the grooves\nin them, you would listen to them.\n\n148\n00:06:48.477 --> 00:06:50.893\nBest quality audio sound in the world,\n\n149\n00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:54.200\nforget about all that great\nnewfangled technology.\n\n150\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.221\nI have a lot of records, I still\nthink records are just the way to go.\n\n151\n00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:58.217\nThe cracks, the hisses,\n\n152\n00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:01.540\nthe pops, all that kind of stuff are gonna\nbe part of the experience, so to speak.\n\n153\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.016\nBut you need the really good needles,\n\n154\n00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:05.889\nyou've gotta have the [CROSSTALK]\nneedles and really good record player.\n\n155\n00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.890\nI never got that concept of\nthose high-end audio files.\n\n156\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.990\nI mean, I got it, but I just didn't\nunderstand how I would go out and\n\n157\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.790\nspend 20 grand,\nwhatever it was at the time,\n\n158\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.650\nto buy those really high-end\nrecord players, but people did.\n\n159\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.208\n&gt;&gt; They sure did, you gotta love\nthose audiophiles out there.\n\n160\n00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:21.889\nThey take their sound\nquality really seriously.\n\n161\n00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.586\n&gt;&gt; Today I guess it would be,\nwhatever the equivalents are,\n\n162\n00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:27.350\nthe gold masters they produce and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n163\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.095\nBut anyway, that our random aside for\naudio technology here,\n\n164\n00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:34.712\nduring our conversation of hard\ndrive discussions in CHFI.\n\n165\n00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:37.832\nSo, when we think about the idea of\nthe cylinder we can think literally about\n\n166\n00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.350\nthose records of old,\nthe idea of one of those grooves.\n\n167\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.720\nAnd if we had ten records stacked up and\nhad the same groove in all of them, and\n\n168\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.300\nif we sliced through and\ntook the chunk of data in each one,\n\n169\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.953\nthat whole thing together is\nwhat we think of as a cylinder.\n\n170\n00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:53.790\nThe head, we go back to our little\ndiagrammatic representation here.\n\n171\n00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.335\nSo we can point to the head,\nDaniel's pointing to the head right there.\n\n172\n00:07:56.335 --> 00:08:00.026\nThe device present on the arm of the hard\ndrive, kind of, yeah, on the actuator,\n\n173\n00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:02.560\non the arm right there,\nthat allows us to read or write.\n\n174\n00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.473\nIt's the very edge,\n\n175\n00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:06.675\nit is that diamond-tipped needle I was\njust referring to on a phonograph.\n\n176\n00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:10.490\nEssentially that but not diamond\ntipped to the hard drive, right?\n\n177\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.440\nHopefully not, right?\n\n178\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.475\nVery expensive if it was.\n\n179\n00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:15.302\nThe platter is gonna be the disk like\nstructure that we pointed to, so\n\n180\n00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:18.050\nthat's where we actually see\nthe cylinders being made up of.\n\n181\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.534\nThe spindle will be the shaft, right?\n\n182\n00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:23.130\nIts sitting in the middle kinda binds\nthem all together right in there.\n\n183\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.620\nAnd the actuator, it's gonna be\nthat whole assembly over there.\n\n184\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.601\nThe little motor that holds the arm\nin place, allows it to float and\n\n185\n00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:29.571\nmove back and forth.\n\n186\n00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:32.448\nThat's gonna be what controls and\nactually allows for\n\n187\n00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:36.210\naccess by controlling the read-write\narm and controlling the drive.\n\n188\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.088\nSo the mechanisms,\n\n189\n00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:40.560\nthey're moving parts if you'll associated\nwith the traditional hard drive.\n\n190\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.700\nRemember, an SSD drive will not look like\nthis, it would have no moving parts, it\n\n191\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.900\nwould just be a set of circuits inside a\ncontainer that are basically flash memory,\n\n192\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.074\nfor lack of better way of describing them.\n\n193\n00:08:51.074 --> 00:08:53.418\nThat are gonna be solid states\nmemory as what we talked about.\n\n194\n00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:57.342\nBut they operate the same way, just gonna\naccess them through a control board and\n\n195\n00:08:57.342 --> 00:09:00.990\nreally have none on this moving gear and\nall the things associated with it.\n\n196\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.091\nSo its gonna look very different so,\nwanna make sure we think about that, but\n\n197\n00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:06.807\nwith regards to the hard drive.\n\n198\n00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:09.224\nStarting out with really understanding\nwhat a hard drive is and\n\n199\n00:09:09.224 --> 00:09:10.370\nhow it is structured.\n\n200\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.620\nCuz, believe it or not, we may actually\nget asked, hey, what is the part that\n\n201\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.420\nholds the arm in the hard drive, and makes\nit available for movement and reading?\n\n202\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.880\nAnd that would be the actuator.\n\n203\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.000\nHey, what's the piece that holds all\nthe platters together and binds them so\n\n204\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.700\nthey can rotate?\n\n205\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.287\nThat would be the spindle, right?\n\n206\n00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:26.620\nSo we wanna think about\nthose kinda things.\n\n207\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.610\nWhere do we find cylinders?\n\n208\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.860\nOn the platter, right?\n\n209\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.110\nSo we wanna know those things.\n\n210\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.695\nSo just make sure you're aware that,\nwe often talk about track density.\n\n211\n00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:36.045\nTrack density, as we were just\ndescribing with the cylinder,\n\n212\n00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:37.825\nnumber of tracks in the hard disk overall.\n\n213\n00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:42.165\nWe talked about areal density, or\nreal density, you hear it referred to or\n\n214\n00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.915\npronounced different ways.\n\n215\n00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.275\nThe number of bits per\nsquare inch on the platter.\n\n216\n00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:49.527\nSo we think about this being\na geometry problem essentially,\n\n217\n00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.404\nwhere we have a cylindrical\nrepresentation of space,\n\n218\n00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:55.352\nhow much stuff can we get in\nthere based on certain laws?\n\n219\n00:09:55.352 --> 00:09:57.430\nAnd calculations so we can measure that.\n\n220\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.910\nAnd then bit density the number of\nbits per unit length of the track.\n\n221\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.710\nSo we can measure the track density,\nthe areal density, and the bit density.\n\n222\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.555\nThree different measures\nof information and\n\n223\n00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:10.105\nsubstance with regards to\nhow the drive is set up and\n\n224\n00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:13.415\nagain probably just wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with the logic of that.\n\n225\n00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:16.255\nThat is recorded used or\nrecorded on to the hard drive\n\n226\n00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:19.675\nplotter is usually what's called\nthe zoned bit recording mechanism or\n\n227\n00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:23.880\nmethodology and\nthis is grouping tracks into zones.\n\n228\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.864\nWe talked about tracks based on their\ndistance from the center of the disk.\n\n229\n00:10:26.864 --> 00:10:29.009\nAnd we are going to\nrecord in that track and\n\n230\n00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:32.640\nput a certain amount of information\nin that track based on where it is.\n\n231\n00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.620\nSo we go back to the hard drive for\na minute.\n\n232\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.760\nConcern maybe I could leverage your\nexpertise in pointing yet one more time.\n\n233\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.706\nYou can just point to the platter,\ndoesn't matter where.\n\n234\n00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.702\nSo if we're just thinking about the fact\nthat, yeah, thank you very much.\n\n235\n00:10:43.702 --> 00:10:45.326\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; So if we're thinking perhaps about\n\n236\n00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:47.110\njust this area right over here.\n\n237\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.895\nLet's say Say hypothetically along\nthis curve that I'm just kinda\n\n238\n00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:52.815\ndrawing on the Plexiglass\nhere on the top of the drive.\n\n239\n00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:55.628\nIf we think that is going\nto be on the platter, and\n\n240\n00:10:55.628 --> 00:10:59.815\ncertainly that is going to be a grouping\nof pieces of information based on\n\n241\n00:10:59.815 --> 00:11:02.375\nunderstanding that there are tracks here.\n\n242\n00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:06.284\nAnd when we're recording we're recording\ninto those track areas to put information\n\n243\n00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:07.434\nonto the drive, right.\n\n244\n00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.909\nSo we just wanna be\nthinking about that and\n\n245\n00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:13.968\nagain have a sense in our minds\nof what all that stuff may mean.\n\n246\n00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:18.560\nSo we wanna understand how we store\ninformation with the mechanical aspects\n\n247\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.740\nof a traditional hard\ndrive are as we begin.\n\n248\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.268\nBut let's also talk about the file systems\nthat are gonna actually be resonant on\n\n249\n00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:27.930\nthat hard-drive cuz we're talking at\na high level just about moving parts,\n\n250\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.530\nwhat about the actual software?\n\n251\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.250\nThat goes on top in theory or\nit's loaded into,\n\n252\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.840\nprobably think of it more accurately onto\na hard-drive, lots of different file\n\n253\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.200\nsystems that exists by no way exhaustive\nlist, but there are common ones, right?\n\n254\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.260\nWhen I say to you FAT, hopefully you're\nthinking about things like FAT32, but\n\n255\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.320\nyou may not realize\nthere're actually three\n\n256\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.200\ndistinct types of the FAT file system,\nFAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.\n\n257\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.845\nFAT12, most people don't know, least today\na lot of people have forgotten that FAT12\n\n258\n00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:57.732\nis what we would see on floppy disks.\n\n259\n00:11:57.732 --> 00:11:59.640\nWe've used that there.\n\n260\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.857\nFAT16 and or FAT32.\n\n261\n00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:04.690\nNTFS, an oldie and\nstill a goodie cause it is still around.\n\n262\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.310\nEXT, EXT2, 3, or now 4 most recently.\n\n263\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.120\nMost recent version we've seen\nin Linux systems traditionally.\n\n264\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.970\nEFS the encrypting file system, a subset\nof NTFS and the functionalities there for\n\n265\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.128\ncryptographic protection of data.\n\n266\n00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:22.538\nAnd HFS, HFS Plus, a file system near and\ndear to your heart sir among many others,\n\n267\n00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:23.489\ncuz you use that.\n\n268\n00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:26.372\nOr at least you Approach\nusing that on the Macintosh?\n\n269\n00:12:26.372 --> 00:12:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n270\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.030\n&gt;&gt; So certainly,\none that you're familiar with, right?\n\n271\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.420\nComes to us from a Linux-Unix\nbackground as well.\n\n272\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.810\nMacOS has its roots in that\nkind of an environment, and so\n\n273\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.410\nas a result, we see it there.\n\n274\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.690\nInteresting when you think about\nthe choices people make, right?\n\n275\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.200\nThink about that historical a story and\nconflict.\n\n276\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.108\nThe story conversations and conflicts\naround Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and\n\n277\n00:12:46.108 --> 00:12:48.776\nhow they were and\nthen were not working together and\n\n278\n00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:52.374\nhow they go off literally to found\nbasically what one could argue were\n\n279\n00:12:52.374 --> 00:12:56.120\ntwo of the most important technology\ncompanies of the 20th century.\n\n280\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.805\nAnd yet when we think about\nthe choices they made, and\n\n281\n00:12:58.805 --> 00:13:02.923\nthe systems that they created, and the\nways in which they kinda did that, you're\n\n282\n00:13:02.923 --> 00:13:07.219\nvery distinctly polar opposite directions,\nwhich is of course one of the reasons why\n\n283\n00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:11.480\nthey couldn't sit in the same room and get\nalong together for more than two minutes.\n\n284\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.909\nBut, the reality is, Steve Jobs takes that\ncompany in a very different direction.\n\n285\n00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:19.690\nGoes the more traditional Linux Unix\nroute, in terms of the background, and\n\n286\n00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.910\nthe theories and things he come from,\nand what he puts into.\n\n287\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.780\nThe beginnings that would lead\nto the first First Apple OS and\n\n288\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.590\nultimately the founding of\nthe dynasty that that company is.\n\n289\n00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.870\nAnd when you think about\nwhere Microsoft wound up and\n\n290\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.810\nalthough they did really start\nfrom that DOS background.\n\n291\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.000\nIt was really a very different\nthought process from the beginning.\n\n292\n00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.543\nAnd emerged and morphed into a graphical\nuser interface that while certainly has\n\n293\n00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:46.686\nvery common aspects associated with\nit like the original apple graphical\n\n294\n00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:49.827\nuser interfaces did,\nwe're diametrically opposed,\n\n295\n00:13:49.827 --> 00:13:51.923\njust in terms of the file structure.\n\n296\n00:13:51.923 --> 00:13:55.763\nThe nature and the thought process of what\nthat meant and ultimately the ease and\n\n297\n00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:56.402\nusability.\n\n298\n00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:59.060\nRight and just the terms of what\nthat was and how it came about.\n\n299\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.211\nSo, kind of interesting just\nwhen you think about all that.\n\n300\n00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:02.488\nAlright, anyway, hard drive interface.\n\n301\n00:14:02.488 --> 00:14:04.325\nSo we've talked about hard drives,\n\n302\n00:14:04.325 --> 00:14:08.190\ntalked about basic file systems lot more\nto say about those and how they work.\n\n303\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.780\nBut what about the hard drive interface?\n\n304\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.550\nTraditionally, while we can name\nmany of them, there are six or\n\n305\n00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.060\nso that tend to pop up time and again.\n\n306\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.310\nAgain, not an exhaustive list, just really\ntalking about common ones that are very,\n\n307\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.030\nmore often than not, very prevalent.\n\n308\n00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.410\nTherefore as an investigator\nones we would often come across,\n\n309\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.690\nscuzy would be on that list,\nprobably at the top of that list today.\n\n310\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:33.340\nScuzy and Iscuzy certainly not just scuzy\nbut overall a small computer interface or\n\n311\n00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.210\niscuzy the equivalent of that on\nthe storage and the traditionally.\n\n312\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.278\nInternet based scuzy scuzy over\nthe internet as a protocol for\n\n313\n00:14:40.278 --> 00:14:41.400\nstorage management.\n\n314\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.297\nBut scuzy is a hard drive\ninterface certainly an oldly and\n\n315\n00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:47.796\nstill very very prevalent enable\nconnections of up to these days 16\n\n316\n00:14:47.796 --> 00:14:52.240\nperipheral devices against one PCI board\nor connections through daisy chaining.\n\n317\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.600\nTraditionally ATA right and\nwe see things like SATA and\n\n318\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.570\nPATA and things that go with ATA but\n\n319\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.000\njust generically it's a catch all category\nATA Advanced Technology Attachment.\n\n320\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000\nIf we run serial connections\nhave duplex at about one and\n\n321\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.800\na half gigs up to roughly about six\ngigs per second of information exchange.\n\n322\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.369\nIf we run parallel, cable length will be\nup to about 18 inches as we connect up on\n\n323\n00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:17.899\nthe motherboard just depending on how\nit's implemented, what we're doing.\n\n324\n00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:20.980\nSo SATA versus PATA,\nserial ATA, parallel ATA as I\n\n325\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.440\nwas talking about just put the S or\nthe P in front of that to figure that out.\n\n326\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.000\nUSB, universal serial bus, so\none of these little suckers right here for\n\n327\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.995\ninstance right?\n\n328\n00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:34.160\nAnd just because we want to and we can,\nwe can flip that out and show you,\n\n329\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.340\nthat's an older serial, or your older USB.\n\n330\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.444\nBut the idea would be the same.\n\n331\n00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:40.990\nUniversal Serial Bus as\na hard drive interface.\n\n332\n00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.080\nFiber channel,\npeople often don't think about this, but\n\n333\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.550\ncertainly we do have fiber channel.\n\n334\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.060\nPoint to point directional\nhigh speed interface.\n\n335\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.402\nSupports transmission up to maybe\nabout 40 gigs or so in speed today.\n\n336\n00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:53.840\nIn backend storage networks\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n337\n00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.976\nIDE, EIDE so IDE,\nintegrated drive electronics,\n\n338\n00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:01.270\nenhanced IDE, so newer status for that.\n\n339\n00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.435\nThat's a more traditional old school hard\ndrive where we would have a master and\n\n340\n00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:06.625\na slave designation.\n\n341\n00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:08.649\nThis kind of a hard drive,\nthe one we're looking at.\n\n342\n00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:10.586\nYou wanna hold that so\nit doesn't just flop over there?\n\n343\n00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:14.380\nIf we can just maybe go the top, I can't\neven see that on there cuz it's so dark.\n\n344\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.840\nBut I assume that we could probably\npoint to this area right here, and\n\n345\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.260\nknow that we are pointing to where we\nwould put jumpers, traditionally, maybe.\n\n346\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.640\nAnd we can see there's power there,\nthere's a ribbon cable attachment there.\n\n347\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.150\nWe may or may not have jumpers that would\nbe resident on the drive in this area,\n\n348\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.606\ntraditionally, to be able to set master or\nslave, or other requirements,\n\n349\n00:16:32.606 --> 00:16:34.122\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n350\n00:16:34.122 --> 00:16:35.831\nThat really is kind of\nan older school thing, so\n\n351\n00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:37.861\nyou don't even see that\nreally jumpered much anymore.\n\n352\n00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:41.463\nBut back in the day, 20 years ago,\nhowever long it would have been,\n\n353\n00:16:41.463 --> 00:16:43.479\nyou would have probably seen jumpers,\n\n354\n00:16:43.479 --> 00:16:46.535\nlittle plastic Items that will\ncreate a circuit or allow for\n\n355\n00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:50.660\nconnectivity to read or not read across\nthose pins, that would be put on there.\n\n356\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.535\nYou remember having to fish those\nthings every time you put one on?\n\n357\n00:16:52.535 --> 00:16:53.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You drop it,\n\n358\n00:16:53.328 --> 00:16:55.212\nyou have big fingers like I do and\nyou wanna be able to put it on\n\n359\n00:16:55.212 --> 00:16:56.589\n&gt;&gt; I can't stand those things.\n\n360\n00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:58.940\n&gt;&gt; And you'd have to go hunting for\nit, it fell into the computer, and\n\n361\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.811\nthen you have to have a little\nmagnetic screwdriver.\n\n362\n00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.732\n&gt;&gt; We can't come up with something\nbetter we can make a hard drive,\n\n363\n00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.238\nwe gotta put these-\n&gt;&gt; You can put a man on the moon.\n\n364\n00:17:05.238 --> 00:17:09.021\n&gt;&gt; I kid you not,\nthey are smaller than a Tic Tac.\n\n365\n00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:12.245\n&gt;&gt; Well you can imagine, if you remember\nlooking, literally, they were the width of\n\n366\n00:17:12.245 --> 00:17:14.158\nthose two pins, right, the two pins-\n&gt;&gt; Crazy small.\n\n367\n00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:17.210\n&gt;&gt; It was the width of that, just encased\nin a piece of plastic with two little\n\n368\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.526\nmetal sleeves to slide over the two bins,\nI mean, that's what the jumper was.\n\n369\n00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:21.554\n&gt;&gt; It didn't make it easy for\nus back then.\n\n370\n00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:23.346\n&gt;&gt; No, you have that like this\nlittle tiny fingers and hands.\n\n371\n00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:25.458\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\nit wasn't the coal mines of West Virginia,\n\n372\n00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:26.810\ndon't get us wrong, but [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.027\n&gt;&gt; No, [CROSSTALK] but\nit was challenging, it was challenging.\n\n374\n00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:35.505\nAnd then we had Serial Attached SCSI,\nor SAS, as it was often referred to.\n\n375\n00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:38.639\nPoint-to-point serial protocol\nhandles data flow among and\n\n376\n00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:42.304\nbetween computer storage devices,\nhard drives, tapes, tape drives,\n\n377\n00:17:42.304 --> 00:17:44.565\nthink of that, would be traditionally SAS.\n\n378\n00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:48.219\nInterestingly, unlike SCSI itself,\nwhich was up to 16 devices,\n\n379\n00:17:48.219 --> 00:17:52.890\npeople don't often realize SAS can support\nup to, wickedly large amounts of devices.\n\n380\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.340\nNot that you would chain\nthis many together, but\n\n381\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.940\nup to 65,535 devices could be\nsupported through a SAS chain.\n\n382\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.065\nWhereas with SCSI traditionally, a little\nbit less, only 16 devices per chain.\n\n383\n00:18:04.065 --> 00:18:07.235\nYou could have multiple setups or multiple\nsystems that are chained together,\n\n384\n00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:10.355\nbut you would have just 16, so\na little bit of a difference there.\n\n385\n00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:12.843\nWe talked about platters,\ntalked about tracks,\n\n386\n00:18:12.843 --> 00:18:15.340\nthe idea of concentric\ncircles on the hard drive.\n\n387\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.897\nWhat we didn't mention were\ntrack numbering schemes and\n\n388\n00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:21.745\nunderstanding the concept of how tracks\nare numbered will be important for us.\n\n389\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:22.915\nAs always, without exception,\n\n390\n00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:27.060\nalmost everything we do in computers,\nwe begin numbering with a big old zero.\n\n391\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.970\nSo we number with zero from\nthe outer edge of the platter,\n\n392\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.990\nwe move in when we're\ntalking about tracks.\n\n393\n00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.780\nTypically we reach a value of 1023 by\nthe time we reach the inner core of that\n\n394\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.968\nplatter, up against the spindle.\n\n395\n00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:41.845\nSo we would normally have\na track from inside out,\n\n396\n00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:46.377\nor rather, outside in, zero at the outer\nedge, tracking all the way across.\n\n397\n00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:51.921\nThat means we would have 1023, or 1024\nrather, concentric circles of smaller and\n\n398\n00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:56.180\nsmaller widths as we go from out to in,\nbeing the number of the tracks.\n\n399\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.743\nThink about that, you've got 1024\nconcentric circles or tracks onto that\n\n400\n00:18:59.743 --> 00:19:03.476\nplatter on each side, and then you would\nobviously have multiple ones stacked up.\n\n401\n00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.123\nYou've got quite a large\nnumber of those things.\n\n402\n00:19:06.123 --> 00:19:08.213\nRemember, heads moved in or\nout jointly, so\n\n403\n00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:11.852\nboth heads are always located at the same\ntrack number, right on either side.\n\n404\n00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:15.030\nTrack five in other words, top and\nbottom, would be at the same for both.\n\n405\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.710\nIt would always be at the same distance\nfrom the spindle moving out, so\n\n406\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.650\nthe same radius across the circle,\nif you will.\n\n407\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.110\nAnd the cylinder, remember, is the group\nof all those tracks linked together for\n\n408\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.381\nthat head position on the disk,\nas we think about it.\n\n409\n00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:28.150\nSo if we had ten stacked up, and\n\n410\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.164\nwe had track five we'd have ten\nread/write arms reading track five,\n\n411\n00:19:32.164 --> 00:19:37.357\nacross ten platters, top and bottom, total\nof 20 platters, both top and bottom side.\n\n412\n00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:41.439\nBut then that track would be the same at\nthe same distance at the same geographical\n\n413\n00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:43.192\nreference point all the way down.\n\n414\n00:19:43.192 --> 00:19:46.165\nAnd the cylinder would make up\nthe core of track five's knowledge,\n\n415\n00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:48.930\nall the way across all those\ntracks across ten platters.\n\n416\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.650\nThat's how we think about that.\n\n417\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.327\nWe have sectors and we have clusters,\nwe have bits, bytes, and nibbles, too.\n\n418\n00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:57.353\nWe have all sorts of snack-like\nreferences on hard drives.\n\n419\n00:19:57.353 --> 00:19:59.443\nI think the people that came\nup with this were hungry when\n\n420\n00:19:59.443 --> 00:20:00.470\nthey were setting this up.\n\n421\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.620\nBecause, literally,\nwe will get into bits, bytes, and\n\n422\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.720\nnibbles in our conversation\nat some point about how we\n\n423\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.070\nessentially break down the amount of\nstorage and just how small things are.\n\n424\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.957\nSo sector is the smallest physical\nstorage unit on the platter,\n\n425\n00:20:11.957 --> 00:20:14.639\nwe refer to the sector as being\nthe unit we measure against.\n\n426\n00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:18.226\nHolds 512 bytes of data, and\nsome additional bytes, typically for\n\n427\n00:20:18.226 --> 00:20:20.150\ndrive control and error correction.\n\n428\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.319\nBut actual data itself,\n512 bytes in a sector.\n\n429\n00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:28.204\nAdvanced formatting,\nwe use 8 512 byte sectors bound together,\n\n430\n00:20:28.204 --> 00:20:30.205\nin what we call a 4K sector.\n\n431\n00:20:30.205 --> 00:20:34.319\nSo 4,096 bytes will be what\na 4K sector is trunked out as.\n\n432\n00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:35.704\nAnd we do advanced formatting,\n\n433\n00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:39.258\nthat's how we actually start trunking out\nthe data and laying it out on the drive.\n\n434\n00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:41.499\nSo when you choose that\nadvanced formatting option,\n\n435\n00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:44.300\nyou're creating a 4K sector and\ngroups of them as you go.\n\n436\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.350\nSo, data's stored on the disk\nover a contiguous series.\n\n437\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.840\nSo for a file, let's say, is gonna be\nbigger than 512 bytes, let's say our file,\n\n438\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.526\njust for argument's sake,\nis gonna be a 1024 bytes.\n\n439\n00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:58.370\n512 times 2, 1024,\n\n440\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.069\nwe'd have two contiguous sectors\nstore them side by side.\n\n441\n00:21:02.069 --> 00:21:06.443\nIf it was 800 bytes, 512 and then a little\nbit, we would still have contiguous\n\n442\n00:21:06.443 --> 00:21:10.694\nsectors, but the other sector would\nnot be full, we would dump 150, 200,\n\n443\n00:21:10.694 --> 00:21:14.860\n300 bytes, whatever it took, in there,\nand that would be the end of it.\n\n444\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.380\nWe would not use the rest of it,\nto be able to store that, so\n\n445\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.600\njust keep that in mind.\n\n446\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.296\nWe often hear about bad sectors as a\nreference, and something that in our minds\n\n447\n00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:25.155\nas forensic investigators is\nvery important to be aware of.\n\n448\n00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:28.459\nBad sectors are often areas of the drive\nwhere we cannot read or write,\n\n449\n00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:32.323\nwe cannot store data because the storage\ncapacity of the drive, for some reason,\n\n450\n00:21:32.323 --> 00:21:33.681\nbeen impacted negatively.\n\n451\n00:21:33.681 --> 00:21:36.820\nEither a physical flaw on\nthe surface of the platter,\n\n452\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.424\nperhaps a mechanical failure of an aspect\nof the drive access for some reason,\n\n453\n00:21:41.424 --> 00:21:44.442\nthere's different reasons\nwhy that could occur.\n\n454\n00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:49.350\nBut we can also mark sectors as bad,\ndo the air quotes, mark them as bad,\n\n455\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.392\nusing tools, and\nbad actors will hide data in bad sectors.\n\n456\n00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:56.721\nNotice the theme there,\nbad, bad, or bad squared.\n\n457\n00:21:56.721 --> 00:22:00.821\nSo bad actors will hide data in bad\nsectors even though those sectors are not\n\n458\n00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.139\nbad, they will simply use a drive\neditor to mark them as bad,\n\n459\n00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:07.026\nthen they can come back and\nrecover that data later.\n\n460\n00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:10.146\nAnd as forensic investigators,\nif we don't realize that, and\n\n461\n00:22:10.146 --> 00:22:13.841\ndon't search the bad sectors of the drive\nwith tools that can try to get in and\n\n462\n00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:17.580\nread the data there, we may be missing\nthe information we're looking for.\n\n463\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.660\nSo again,\none of the tricks of the trade is,\n\n464\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.890\nnever just assume things\nare the way they are.\n\n465\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.161\nYou find a bad sector in a drive,\nyou go investigate it, see what's there.\n\n466\n00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:28.440\nA lot of times there's nothing there,\nlegitimately it is just a bad sector.\n\n467\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.238\nBut a lot of times we find that it's\nactually a perfectly fine sector.\n\n468\n00:22:32.238 --> 00:22:34.884\nIt's okay, you're perfectly fine,\nyou're a good sector, but\n\n469\n00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:36.738\nwe actually find there's\ndata hidden there.\n\n470\n00:22:36.738 --> 00:22:38.988\nWe have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that, so\n\n471\n00:22:38.988 --> 00:22:41.088\njust something to keep in mind and\nbe aware of.\n\n472\n00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:44.608\nWe've talked about clusters and\nslack space, the list just goes on and\n\n473\n00:22:44.608 --> 00:22:45.144\non and on.\n\n474\n00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:48.327\nSo cluster,\nsmallest allocation unit of a hard drive.\n\n475\n00:22:48.327 --> 00:22:51.867\nRemember we just talked about\nthe fact that, excuse me,\n\n476\n00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:56.090\nthe byte is the smallest physical\nstorage unit on the disc platter.\n\n477\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.040\nBut the cluster is the smallest allocation\nunit of the hard drive overall.\n\n478\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.530\nJust remember the difference there.\n\n479\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.422\nSet of tracks and sectors,\nfrom 2 to 32 grouped together,\n\n480\n00:23:04.422 --> 00:23:05.821\nwill create a cluster for us.\n\n481\n00:23:05.821 --> 00:23:09.624\nSo minimum of 2 tracks and\nsectors grouped together,\n\n482\n00:23:09.624 --> 00:23:12.527\nmaximum of 32, will give us a cluster.\n\n483\n00:23:12.527 --> 00:23:15.374\nTypically 4K in size as well,\nas we were talking about.\n\n484\n00:23:15.374 --> 00:23:18.417\nBut it depends on the size of the disk\npartition, it could be bigger or\n\n485\n00:23:18.417 --> 00:23:21.681\nsmaller depending on the nature of\nthe partition, just be aware of that.\n\n486\n00:23:21.681 --> 00:23:25.118\nLost clusters are typically\ngonna be what's called the FAT,\n\n487\n00:23:25.118 --> 00:23:30.011\nfile allocation table error, that results\nfrom the operating system marking clusters\n\n488\n00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:32.673\nas being used but\nthen not allocating them out.\n\n489\n00:23:32.673 --> 00:23:34.483\nOr not -reallocating\nthem if they're not used.\n\n490\n00:23:34.483 --> 00:23:37.933\nThere's some errors that could occur\nwithin the allocation table of the drive,\n\n491\n00:23:37.933 --> 00:23:40.580\nso these are logical errors,\nin other words, not physical.\n\n492\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.446\nThey're bookkeeping errors, essentially.\n\n493\n00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:47.956\nYeah, sector rather, sectors in tracks 5,\n7, and 9 in cluster 5 are being used.\n\n494\n00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:51.421\nWell, no they're not, we just made\na mistake and wrote a 9 instead of 6 or\n\n495\n00:23:51.421 --> 00:23:51.976\nwhatever.\n\n496\n00:23:51.976 --> 00:23:55.097\nThat's just a clerical error,\nwe're filekeeping incorrectly.\n\n497\n00:23:55.097 --> 00:23:58.169\nIt's not that those sectors,\nnot that those clusters,\n\n498\n00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:02.465\nnot that those tracks are bad, that\nthere's actually a damage to the platter.\n\n499\n00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:05.782\nBut rather, just logically, we've said,\nthey're not in a certain place and\n\n500\n00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:06.983\nbeing used in a certain way.\n\n501\n00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:08.403\nWhen in fact they may or may not be.\n\n502\n00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:09.735\nSo just remember that.\n\n503\n00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:12.740\nIf you don't close files properly,\nyou tend to get lost clusters.\n\n504\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.970\nSo if you shut down the computer\nby pulling the power plug\n\n505\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.910\ninstead of shutting it off the right way.\n\n506\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.500\nIf you're that kind of person\nthat leaves files open and\n\n507\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.490\njust shuts the computer down and\nlets the computer deal with it, and\n\n508\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.960\na lot of times it says, hey, wait,\nI can't do that, there's stuff open.\n\n509\n00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.630\nDo you want me to wait?\n\n510\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.245\nAnd you're one of those no, no, no.\n\n511\n00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:31.610\nYou just keep going until it just\nfails everything and shuts down.\n\n512\n00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.565\nYou might create bad clusters because what\nyou're doing is creating fragmentory data\n\n513\n00:24:35.565 --> 00:24:38.490\nthat's not allocated properly\non the file allocation table and\n\n514\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.670\nthen those clusters\nare not marked correctly.\n\n515\n00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.705\nAnd as a result, there could be error or\n\n516\n00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:47.160\ncorruption that takes place with regards\nto going in and keeping track of that.\n\n517\n00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.838\nThe way we deal with that, is you will run\noff, in Windows anyway, disk check, right?\n\n518\n00:24:50.838 --> 00:24:53.865\nSo you go in and do a disk check,\nuse the disk check program.\n\n519\n00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:57.511\nAnd a lot of times it will say do you want\nme to find bad clusters, bad sectors?\n\n520\n00:24:57.511 --> 00:24:59.273\nBut it'll mark that sector,\n\n521\n00:24:59.273 --> 00:25:04.390\nit'll repair bad clusters by getting rid\nof the references that are incorrect.\n\n522\n00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.000\nSo there's a way to go through and\ndo this, and\n\n523\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.030\nlost clusters can be looked for and\ncan be recovered traditionally.\n\n524\n00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.240\nJust be aware of that.\n\n525\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.528\nAgain, the disk check program\nin Windows will do that for you.\n\n526\n00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:14.817\nYes.\n\n527\n00:25:14.817 --> 00:25:16.106\nYou had that I have a question face.\n\n528\n00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:17.129\n&gt;&gt; No, I was just.\n\n529\n00:25:17.129 --> 00:25:18.521\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or you were just-\n\n530\n00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:19.973\n&gt;&gt; I was agreeing with you [CROSSTALK]\n\n531\n00:25:19.973 --> 00:25:20.862\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Just thinking, hey.\n\n532\n00:25:20.862 --> 00:25:25.274\nI wanna throw something in there.\n\n533\n00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:26.401\nMy mistake.\n\n534\n00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:29.375\nYou can't always read body language out\nof the corner of your eye correctly so.\n\n535\n00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:33.065\nAll I saw was a swivel of the head and\na smile of the teeth, so I thought, hey,\n\n536\n00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:34.825\nthat's our sign, but I was wrong.\n\n537\n00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:37.169\nAll right so, slack space.\n\n538\n00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:39.990\nDid you ever see the movie Mallrats?\n\n539\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n540\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think I did, yes.\n\n541\n00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:42.510\n&gt;&gt; You did, right.\n\n542\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.148\nSo Slacker-\n&gt;&gt; Kevin Smith.\n\n543\n00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:44.544\n&gt;&gt; You ever see Slackers?\n\n544\n00:25:44.544 --> 00:25:46.442\n&gt;&gt; I think I saw that as well.\n\n545\n00:25:46.442 --> 00:25:49.802\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Was that where they were trying to pass\n\n546\n00:25:49.802 --> 00:25:51.399\ncollege exams and?\n\n547\n00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:52.200\nYes, I saw that one.\n\n548\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:52.789\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n549\n00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:53.921\nGood, good, good, good one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, it was.\n\n550\n00:25:53.921 --> 00:25:54.995\n&gt;&gt; Good, good set of movies, I should say.\n\n551\n00:25:54.995 --> 00:25:56.398\nGood set of movies, anyway, all right, so.\n\n552\n00:25:56.398 --> 00:25:56.898\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:25:56.898 --> 00:25:57.953\n&gt;&gt; Not that it has anything to do with\n\n554\n00:25:57.953 --> 00:25:58.911\nwhat we're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; Well Slack is.\n\n555\n00:25:58.911 --> 00:26:00.441\n&gt;&gt; It's a random aside reference.\n\n556\n00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:01.899\nAll right, so slack space, this is\n\n557\n00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:05.600\nthe free space that we see on the cluster\nafter writing data into that cluster.\n\n558\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.720\nWhatever's left over, in other words,\nis called slack space.\n\n559\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.748\nHey, we got 4K, we use 2.5,\nwe got approximately 1.5K of slack space.\n\n560\n00:26:11.748 --> 00:26:13.510\nThat's very quickly how it works.\n\n561\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.048\nSo if the size of the stored data is\nless than the cluster's overall size,\n\n562\n00:26:17.048 --> 00:26:20.946\nthat unused area remains reserved for\nthe file even though it's not being used.\n\n563\n00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:24.515\nCuz remember we write into that\nblock one time and then that's it.\n\n564\n00:26:24.515 --> 00:26:27.214\nIt has to be contiguous, so\nwe're not gonna go back and\n\n565\n00:26:27.214 --> 00:26:28.985\nfill that space in with other data.\n\n566\n00:26:28.985 --> 00:26:31.180\nWe're reserving it for use of that file.\n\n567\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.462\nSo there may be slack space,\nspace that is allocated but not used.\n\n568\n00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:36.220\nAnd that's what slack space is.\n\n569\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.169\nCould we take advantage\nof that as a bad actor?\n\n570\n00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:39.950\nCould we potentially put data in there?\n\n571\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.370\nWe do have tools that could take advantage\nof slack space and write into that,\n\n572\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.900\neven though normally,\nwe're not supposed to.\n\n573\n00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.720\nRemember, we are operating in a system,\n\n574\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.680\na graphical user interfacing file system,\nan OS.\n\n575\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.150\nThat has certain rules.\n\n576\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.770\nIf bad actors choose to go around and\nnot behave according to those rules by\n\n577\n00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.490\nusing tools that get around them or\nusing access to systems out of level.\n\n578\n00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.260\nCommand line, root level access,\nwhatever the case may be, that violate or\n\n579\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.380\nessentially ignore those rules,\nthen they may be\n\n580\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.800\nable to operate in a way that we would\nnot normally feel would be acceptable.\n\n581\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.070\nBut we have to be aware of\nthe fact that they can.\n\n582\n00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.510\nAnd indeed they do, and\ndo on a regular basis, right?\n\n583\n00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.990\nSo we have to think\nlike the bad actors and\n\n584\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.980\nunderstand that these things\nare possible or they will get away and\n\n585\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.550\nbe able to do these things because\nwe're just not looking for them.\n\n586\n00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.909\nI mentioned the discussion about bit\nby the nibble, well, here we are, folks\n\n587\n00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:30.334\n&gt;&gt; Ha, we have made it.\n\n588\n00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:32.792\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have made it, exciting as it is.\n\n589\n00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:35.258\nSo get out your snack trays and\nwe'll pause for just a second,\n\n590\n00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:37.950\na little cheese and\nwine is appropriate typically, right?\n\n591\n00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.337\nAnd so a bit by the nibble.\n\n592\n00:27:39.337 --> 00:27:40.134\nLet's talk about that.\n\n593\n00:27:40.134 --> 00:27:41.792\nSo a bit is short for a binary digit.\n\n594\n00:27:41.792 --> 00:27:43.734\nI also love the way they\nconcatonate things.\n\n595\n00:27:43.734 --> 00:27:44.419\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n596\n00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:46.152\n&gt;&gt; Right, the byte,\nshort for binary term or\n\n597\n00:27:46.152 --> 00:27:47.850\nbinary term that consists of eight bits.\n\n598\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.400\nSo you know, bytes are made up of bits.\n\n599\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.220\nPeople often get this whole\nthing kind of turned around.\n\n600\n00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.202\nAnd a nibble, right?\n\n601\n00:27:53.202 --> 00:27:55.955\nNibble is known as a half byte or\na tetrad.\n\n602\n00:27:55.955 --> 00:27:57.604\n&gt;&gt; Tetrad,\nI have not heard that one before.\n\n603\n00:27:57.604 --> 00:27:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what a nibble is.\n\n604\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.370\nA nibble is a half byte, in other words.\n\n605\n00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.370\nOr essentially it's also called a tetrad.\n\n606\n00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.740\nIt's a collection of four bits, right?\n\n607\n00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.234\nRemember eight bits make up a byte.\n\n608\n00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:08.700\nAnd so a nibble is a half byte.\n\n609\n00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.500\nSo it's half of the byte or four bits.\n\n610\n00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.076\nSo a bit is gonna be the smallest unit\nof data overall that we think of.\n\n611\n00:28:15.076 --> 00:28:18.751\nContains only one of the two values\nrepresented in binary system 01.\n\n612\n00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:21.120\nOn off, true false,\nwhatever you wanna think of.\n\n613\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.580\nThey also could be used to\nrepresent things like true false,\n\n614\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.060\nyes no, on off in different systems\ndepending on how the logic is set up.\n\n615\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.530\nBut essentially, it's able to contain just\ntwo values, right, whatever those are.\n\n616\n00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.100\nAnd as a result of that, we think of it\nas the smallest overall unit of data.\n\n617\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.919\nThat's what the bit is,\nput eight of them together we get a byte.\n\n618\n00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:40.000\nIt's just a representation of\nthe number of bits in the system.\n\n619\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.630\nWe use that to encode one character, a one\ntext of character, one character overall,\n\n620\n00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.170\nso the letter A, letter B, whatever,\nmade up of a certain number of bytes.\n\n621\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.440\nThe byte is the smallest\naddressable unit of memory.\n\n622\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.240\nSo the bit is the smallest\naddressable unit of data.\n\n623\n00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.810\nThe byte is the smallest\naddressable unit of memory or\n\n624\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.930\nmemory unit, as we often represent that.\n\n625\n00:29:00.182 --> 00:29:04.430\nTwo hexadecimal digits represent\na full byte, or what we call an octet.\n\n626\n00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.310\nYou may have heard that term before,\nright?\n\n627\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.360\nEight bits is an octet, as we often\ntalk about with IP addressing and\n\n628\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.580\nthings of that nature.\n\n629\n00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.870\nAnd a nibble as I said, a half byte\nfour bits, also known as a tetrad,\n\n630\n00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.889\na collection of four bits or\nhalf an octet.\n\n631\n00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:18.308\nA byte is two nibbles.\n\n632\n00:29:18.308 --> 00:29:20.138\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n633\n00:29:20.138 --> 00:29:24.167\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n634\n00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:27.149\na byte is also known as two nibbles\n&gt;&gt; So you could have a nosh, a byte,\n\n635\n00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:28.221\na nibble-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n636\n00:29:28.221 --> 00:29:29.860\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you want when you're hungry.\n\n637\n00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.270\nYou could just have all sorts\nof crazy stuff going on.\n\n638\n00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.681\nAnd all of it, without exception, would\nrefer back to how much information you had\n\n639\n00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:38.037\njust ingested and/or stored,\nif you think about that.\n\n640\n00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.818\n[LAUGH] All right, so\njust beginning our conversation,\n\n641\n00:29:40.818 --> 00:29:45.019\ngonna finish up one quick thing here with\nhard drive, hard disk I should say, data,\n\n642\n00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:47.800\naddressing before we wrap up\nour first conversation and\n\n643\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.930\ncome back because we got a whole\nbunch more to go through.\n\n644\n00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.898\nBut I just want to quickly throw out\nthe idea of cylinder head sector versus\n\n645\n00:29:54.898 --> 00:29:57.333\nlogical block addressing, CHS versus LBA.\n\n646\n00:29:57.333 --> 00:30:00.306\nWhen we think about hard disk data,\nand how we address the data,\n\n647\n00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:02.069\nhow we actually reference it and say,\n\n648\n00:30:02.069 --> 00:30:05.840\nI want that piece of data right over there\nin that track, in that sector, right?\n\n649\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.110\nWe don't say, hey,\ngive me byte number five.\n\n650\n00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:13.090\nWe say that I wanna be able to read that\nbased on a certain mathematical concept or\n\n651\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.490\ncertain way of addressing.\n\n652\n00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.622\nAnd cylinder head sector and/or logical\nblock addressing is how we do that.\n\n653\n00:30:18.622 --> 00:30:22.732\nCHS cylinder head sectors addresses\ndata by simply specifying literally\n\n654\n00:30:22.732 --> 00:30:24.651\nthe cylinder which is, as I said,\n\n655\n00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:28.610\nthe radius head, the platter side and\nsector angular position.\n\n656\n00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:32.990\nMost IDE drives, older drives\nare using CHS as their mechanism.\n\n657\n00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:37.440\nLogical block addressing addresses\ndata by allotting or specifying and\n\n658\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.260\ntherefore allocating a sequential\nnumber to each sector of the hard disk.\n\n659\n00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.330\nSCSI and EID hard drives will use LBA\nas their mechanism for addressing.\n\n660\n00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.730\nSo depending on the nature\nof the technology you use,\n\n661\n00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.070\nyou'll probably using LBA more so\nthen CHS today.\n\n662\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.330\nBut just really varies by what you have.\n\n663\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.110\nIn this drive we would be using CHS here,\n\n664\n00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.420\nmost likely just because of the nature\nof what it is and how it is set up.\n\n665\n00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.220\nBut just be aware of that, so we have a\nsense of how we actually access the data.\n\n666\n00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.460\nAnd what we'll do when we come\nback is talk about data density.\n\n667\n00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.484\nWe'll talk about track,\narrow and bid density.\n\n668\n00:31:08.484 --> 00:31:11.520\nReally just reminding you about those,\nbut we'll have some more to say.\n\n669\n00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.273\nBut we actually will talk about\nhow we calculate disk capacity.\n\n670\n00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:16.305\nMaybe we should do that now\njust before we get done just so\n\n671\n00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:17.350\nwe don't leave it hanging.\n\n672\n00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.387\nWhat do you think?\n&gt;&gt; That's up to you.\n\n673\n00:31:18.387 --> 00:31:21.720\n&gt;&gt; I have to just log back into\nmy screen here for one second.\n\n674\n00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.040\nSo maybe you could chatter with\nthe folks for a moment and\n\n675\n00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.560\njust chew up three seconds\nof time while I log back in.\n\n676\n00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.120\n&gt;&gt; I find it interesting that we started\nwith, what do you think of when you think\n\n677\n00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.670\nof a hard drive and\nI'm like it's a storage device.\n\n678\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.450\nAnd then we go into-\n&gt;&gt; It's so much more.\n\n679\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.350\n&gt;&gt; How much is involved with how\nthat storage is accomplished, right?\n\n680\n00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.920\nIt's not a simple thing even though\nthe device seems very simple.\n\n681\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.120\nIt takes a lot of ongoing,\nthere's a lot of knowledge for us to know.\n\n682\n00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.585\nBecause that's where a lot of evidence\nis gonna be is on storage devices such\n\n683\n00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:51.573\nas hard drives.\n\n684\n00:31:51.573 --> 00:31:54.680\nSo we have to know about them,\nbe able to work with them correctly.\n\n685\n00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:01.721\nWe don't wanna misuse the device and maybe\ncorrupt something, destroy something.\n\n686\n00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:03.873\nThat would be bad for us as investigators.\n\n687\n00:32:03.873 --> 00:32:07.143\nWe wanna make sure the integrity of\nthe device is maintained at all times.\n\n688\n00:32:07.143 --> 00:32:09.239\nWe don't wanna get outside\nof those boundaries.\n\n689\n00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:11.049\nSo okay, Adam, you're ready to rock?\n\n690\n00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, so\nI just wanted to show you one quick thing.\n\n691\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.640\nI think it's a great way to put\nthe capstone on this initial conversation.\n\n692\n00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.424\nSo if you would join me here,\n\n693\n00:32:17.424 --> 00:32:19.135\nwe're just gonna engage in\na little bit of math for a moment.\n\n694\n00:32:19.135 --> 00:32:21.070\nCould we go full screen just so\nwe could see that?\n\n695\n00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.970\nThat will be helpful.\n\n696\n00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.800\nSo I just put the reminders up there,\ntrack, areal, and bit density for\n\n697\n00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.480\nus, just definitions we already gave you.\n\n698\n00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.670\nJust to remind you of\nthe moving parts here so\n\n699\n00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.380\nyou can see what we're talking about\nin the mathematics down below.\n\n700\n00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.540\nBy the way,\nyou may have a calculation here or\n\n701\n00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.170\nthere on an exam like this, nothing crazy.\n\n702\n00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.470\nI worked out the math and just laid it\nall for you there, extended it all out so\n\n703\n00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.970\nyou can see it.\n\n704\n00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.769\nBut if would be, at most something you\nwill be able to do either in your head, or\n\n705\n00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:48.571\nyou are allowed to use a calculator.\n\n706\n00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:50.130\nIf you have to do that,\nyou could do it with a calculator.\n\n707\n00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.341\nSo how would you calculate\nthe overall dis-capacity,\n\n708\n00:32:53.341 --> 00:32:57.450\nis what we ask, tthinking about being\ngiven this kind of information?\n\n709\n00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.525\nSo if a drive has 18,121 cylinders,\n70 heads,\n\n710\n00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:07.346\n43 sectors per track, assume a sector\nis made up of 512 bytes, as we said.\n\n711\n00:33:07.346 --> 00:33:09.895\nWhat would the capacity of this drive be?\n\n712\n00:33:09.895 --> 00:33:13.660\nIf you leave from Indiana at five in the\nmorning on the southern rail line heading\n\n713\n00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.757\nnorth-\n&gt;&gt; I'm already getting the sweats.\n\n714\n00:33:14.757 --> 00:33:17.398\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm driving the opposite direction,\n\n715\n00:33:17.398 --> 00:33:20.206\neating a sandwich while drinking\na cup of coffee, right,\n\n716\n00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:22.685\nat 2 o'clock in the afternoon,\nwhen do I arrive?\n\n717\n00:33:22.685 --> 00:33:23.756\n&gt;&gt; What is the flight speed of a raven?\n[LAUGH]\n\n718\n00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:25.153\n&gt;&gt; I used to hate those problems,\n\n719\n00:33:25.153 --> 00:33:27.695\nI would just give up that point and\nbe like you know what?\n\n720\n00:33:27.695 --> 00:33:28.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, C.\n\n721\n00:33:28.839 --> 00:33:29.410\n&gt;&gt; It's not worth going to the next grade.\n\n722\n00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:30.840\nI don't know, it's just not worth it.\n\n723\n00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.680\nI'm happy where I am,\nl don't need to go to ninth grade.\n\n724\n00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.713\nI'll be happy in eighth grade.\n\n725\n00:33:33.713 --> 00:33:34.242\nl'll be a bigger kid.\n\n726\n00:33:34.242 --> 00:33:36.660\nI'll actually do better, it'll be fine.\n\n727\n00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.286\nBecause those problems used to\njust freak me out to no end.\n\n728\n00:33:38.286 --> 00:33:39.591\nI could never-\n&gt;&gt; Adam is\n\n729\n00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:41.100\nstill in eighth grade, by the way.\n\n730\n00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.836\n&gt;&gt; I am actually.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n731\n00:33:41.836 --> 00:33:42.993\n&gt;&gt; I'm the oldest eighth grader but\n\n732\n00:33:42.993 --> 00:33:44.160\nI have the most wicked beard.\n\n733\n00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.440\n&gt;&gt; His kids have already passed him.\n\n734\n00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.583\n&gt;&gt; They have, and my grandkids, right?\n\n735\n00:33:46.583 --> 00:33:47.700\nThey're just all there.\n\n736\n00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.008\nNo, no grandkids, I'm only kidding.\n\n737\n00:33:49.008 --> 00:33:50.573\nIf we could go back to full screen,\nplease?\n\n738\n00:33:50.573 --> 00:33:52.100\nWe need to see the calculation.\n\n739\n00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.370\nAll right, so\nthen what do we do here, right?\n\n740\n00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:54.820\nThis is just a mathematics problem.\n\n741\n00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.400\nAnd I know, all kidding aside,\nthat scares some people, scares me.\n\n742\n00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.710\nListen, I am not one of those\npeople that's wired to do math.\n\n743\n00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.883\nI get it, and I understand\nthe issues associated with it.\n\n744\n00:34:03.883 --> 00:34:04.417\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n745\n00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:06.162\nPlease go back to the full\nscreen while I'm talking.\n\n746\n00:34:06.162 --> 00:34:07.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n747\n00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.508\nSo as a result, right,\n\n748\n00:34:08.508 --> 00:34:12.780\nI get the fact that you may get freaked\nout a little bit by these numbers.\n\n749\n00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.740\nI get the fact that seeing\nsomething with 12 places,\n\n750\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.012\nkeeping it straight in\nyour head is a problem.\n\n751\n00:34:17.012 --> 00:34:18.990\nDon't overthink this.\n\n752\n00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.010\nKeep it simple, and\n\n753\n00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.710\njust look at the logic of the problem,\nand it actually makes sense.\n\n754\n00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.640\nSo let's take a look.\n\n755\n00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.068\nWhat's the total number of bytes\nis what we're going after, right?\n\n756\n00:34:27.068 --> 00:34:28.190\nWe have 1 hard drive, so\n\n757\n00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.640\nwe're gonna say 1 disk which really\ndoesn't affect the calculation anyway.\n\n758\n00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.120\nWe're just putting it there so you know.\n\n759\n00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.056\nMultiply it by the number of\ncylinders per disk, 18,121.\n\n760\n00:34:37.056 --> 00:34:40.697\nThe number of heads per cylinder,\nso this number,\n\n761\n00:34:40.697 --> 00:34:45.114\nmultiplied by this number,\nmultiplied by 1 track per head.\n\n762\n00:34:45.114 --> 00:34:48.880\nAgain, no big deal there because we\ndon't have to worry about that, but\n\n763\n00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.270\njust pointing that out,\ntimes 43 sectors per track.\n\n764\n00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:56.980\nOkay, so essentially, these three numbers\nright here, multiplied together, okay?\n\n765\n00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.920\nCuz remember, multiplying by 1\ndoesn't change anything, right?\n\n766\n00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.985\n2 times 1 is 2, right?\n\n767\n00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:05.166\n[LAUGH] 1 times 1 is 1, that kind\nof thing, right, it doesn't matter.\n\n768\n00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:07.270\nIt's not gonna change anything.\n\n769\n00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:14.750\nSo we're gonna multiply 18,121, 70, and 43\ntogether times the number of bytes, 512.\n\n770\n00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.920\nSo really when you get a problem\nlike this, you just have to take all\n\n771\n00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.110\nthe numbers in the problem,\nright, that are not one, right?\n\n772\n00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.820\nAnd multiply them together,\nthat's the secret.\n\n773\n00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.692\nAnd when you do all that,\nif you were to do the math, you would get,\n\n774\n00:35:28.692 --> 00:35:32.520\nin this particular case with\nthe numbers I gave you,\n\n775\n00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.751\nyou would get this amount of bytes, right?\n\n776\n00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:39.071\n27,926,635,520, or roughly, what,\nabout almost 28 gigabytes, right, give or\n\n777\n00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:39.790\ntake just about.\n\n778\n00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.040\nIf you round up,\nabout 28 gigabytes, right?\n\n779\n00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.790\nSo we can see that if we were\ngiven this word problem,\n\n780\n00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.600\nin theory, although obviously numbers\nwould most likely be different.\n\n781\n00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.770\nBut if we were given a word problem like\nthis and had to then figure this out,\n\n782\n00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:57.020\nwe would have to extract the number of\ncylinders, heads, sectors per track, and\n\n783\n00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.810\nbytes, multiply together and then that's\ngonna be an extended value in bytes.\n\n784\n00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.470\nAnd remember, we then have to do\nthe calculation if we're asked,\n\n785\n00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.640\nokay, not in bytes.\n\n786\n00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.770\nMaybe the answer is presented in gigabyes,\nkilobytes, petabytes, exabytes, who knows?\n\n787\n00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.070\nYou would just have to convert and\nmake sure you take that number and\n\n788\n00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.810\nscale it out, or scale it up\naccordingly to get the right number.\n\n789\n00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.422\nBut that is how you would\ndo the calculation, right?\n\n790\n00:36:17.422 --> 00:36:19.215\nSo just so we're aware of that.\n\n791\n00:36:19.215 --> 00:36:23.330\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, now we know how to at least\npass one math problem in math class.\n\n792\n00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n793\n00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.004\n&gt;&gt; Or at the CHFI exam,\n\n794\n00:36:25.004 --> 00:36:26.565\nif that's what you're taking.\n\n795\n00:36:26.565 --> 00:36:30.467\nI know if you're like myself, and Adam,\nhe has admitted this as well, math is not\n\n796\n00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:34.050\nmuch fun for a lot of people, and\nwe are all included in that conversation.\n\n797\n00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.850\nMaybe you're a math whiz,\nhopefully you are.\n\n798\n00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.410\nBut it's not that difficult and\nthey're not gonna throw some weird,\n\n799\n00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.440\ncrazy calculations.\n\n800\n00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.810\n&gt;&gt; It's just an interesting observation,\nso I've found, and I think you and\n\n801\n00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.180\nI have talked about this before.\n\n802\n00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.656\nI've found that as I got older,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n803\n00:36:45.656 --> 00:36:47.453\nmath actually became easier for me.\n\n804\n00:36:47.453 --> 00:36:51.184\nAnd I will freely admit, as I told you, I\nam not the person you want doing math for\n\n805\n00:36:51.184 --> 00:36:52.320\nyou on a regular basis.\n\n806\n00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.440\nIt's not my strong suit.\n\n807\n00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.000\nAnd given what I do for a living,\npeople are very surprised by that.\n\n808\n00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.440\nBut you don't really need a lot\nof math to do what we do.\n\n809\n00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.100\nIf you do it professionally,\nyou know that.\n\n810\n00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.531\nA lot of these tools will auto\ncalculate things for you.\n\n811\n00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:05.041\nAnd things like disk size,\nyou don't have to sit and\n\n812\n00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:06.820\nwork out manually anymore, right?\n\n813\n00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.660\nI mean, just you don't do those things,\nit's all figured out for you.\n\n814\n00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.850\nBut I've found, as I've had to go back and\nhelp my kids through math,\n\n815\n00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.260\nthings like that,\nthat I've actually gotten better at it.\n\n816\n00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.434\nI think number one because I'm\nnot as scared of it as an adult.\n\n817\n00:37:17.434 --> 00:37:20.155\nIt's easier for me to contemplate\nthe idea that I could sit down and\n\n818\n00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:23.350\nactually logically think through\nthis problem and make it make sense.\n\n819\n00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.858\nBut I think you also get that\nperspective over a number of years, and\n\n820\n00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:27.120\nit does become easier.\n\n821\n00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.880\nSo I don't fear it as much, right?\n\n822\n00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.621\nNot like the Walking Dead, right?\n\n823\n00:37:30.621 --> 00:37:32.909\nBut I do have a healthy respect for\nit, let's put it that way, right?\n\n824\n00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:34.728\nAnd I know my limitations\nmost importantly.\n\n825\n00:37:34.728 --> 00:37:36.363\n&gt;&gt; All right, [LAUGH] well,\nthere you go, everyone.\n\n826\n00:37:36.363 --> 00:37:39.309\nThanks for watching today, but it looks\nlike it's time for us to sign off.\n\n827\n00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:42.335\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n828\n00:37:42.335 --> 00:37:43.887\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon, that math guy.\n\n829\n00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:45.375\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nwe'll see you next

another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n9\n00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.889\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, well I hope you're back\n\n10\n00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:23.973\nfor CHFI Version 9,\nbecause that's what we're slinging today.\n\n11\n00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:26.435\nSo [LAUGH] joining me back\nin the studio yet again,\n\n12\n00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:29.870\nto lend his expertise on the topic\nis our good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.910\nAdam, we're so glad to have you again,\nhow's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nalways glad to be here, going well.\n\n15\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.720\nGonna continue talking,\nyes it is, it's going finely.\n\n16\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.936\nFinely, that is a word.\n\n17\n00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes it is.\n&gt;&gt; It's going well,\n\n18\n00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:42.718\nwe are gonna continue talking about\nhard drives and file systems.\n\n19\n00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:46.724\nWe spent our last episode laying out some\nof the background, thought processes,\n\n20\n00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:50.569\nthe structural and architectural knowledge\nof hard drives and how they work.\n\n21\n00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.444\nLaid on top of them some of the file\nsystems we may encounter and\n\n22\n00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:57.262\nput together some of the thought processes\naround storage, how we allocate it and\n\n23\n00:00:57.262 --> 00:00:58.330\nunderstand it.\n\n24\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.656\nHopefully that was valuable to you,\n\n25\n00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.346\nif you haven't seen it you may want to go\nback an take a look although it is not\n\n26\n00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:05.114\ndirectly related to the next set of\nconversations that we are going to have.\n\n27\n00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:06.764\nBut it is good foundational knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:09.432\nWe're gonna jump back in and\ntalk to you about partitions and\n\n29\n00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:11.210\nhow we partition a hard drive.\n\n30\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.064\nPartition is really just the act of\ncarving up the hard drive into allocatable\n\n31\n00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.622\nspace and using that space to store\nour data: bits, bytes, nibbles,\n\n32\n00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:21.490\ntetrads, whatever the case may be,\nas we talked about.\n\n33\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.266\nBut the creation of logical divisions on\nthe hard disk that allow us to be able\n\n34\n00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.983\nto then, through the operating system,\nthrough the application of the OS\n\n35\n00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:32.995\nto the hard drive, store our data work\nwith their applications interact with and\n\n36\n00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.772\nuse that through system\nspecific logical formatting.\n\n37\n00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:39.924\nHey, let's create an NTFS partition or\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n38\n00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:41.714\nFAT partition, HFS, etc.\n\n39\n00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:44.906\nAnd that will be driven by the file\nsystem, the operating system, we choose.\n\n40\n00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:47.086\nTwo types of partitions,\nwhat might they be, sir?\n\n41\n00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:47.916\nWhat do we think they are?\n\n42\n00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.686\n&gt;&gt; It would be primary and extended.\n\n43\n00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:51.846\n&gt;&gt; Primary and extended.\n\n44\n00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:54.566\nSo when we think of,\njust making room here for\n\n45\n00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.376\nsomething we're gonna do in just a moment.\n\n46\n00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:59.392\nSo when we think of primary and extended,\n\n47\n00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:03.036\nwhat is the key differentiating\nitem in our mind?\n\n48\n00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:07.536\n&gt;&gt; Well, the primary is like, it's saying\nthis is the partition on the hard drive\n\n49\n00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.452\nwhere we're gonna load an operating\nsystem or something like that.\n\n50\n00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.016\nThen you have extended,\n\n51\n00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:17.200\nwhich is kinda like a logical\nextension of a primary system.\n\n52\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.387\n&gt;&gt; So, typically our data for instance.\n\n53\n00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:18.919\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; More often than not.\n\n54\n00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.507\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n55\n00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.777\n&gt;&gt; Like applications, things like that,\nmay go in the primary.\n\n56\n00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:22.362\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n57\n00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:24.026\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could also tend\nto go in the extended, but\n\n58\n00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:25.130\nthe primary is the bootable one.\n\n59\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.875\n&gt;&gt; Right, usually, yes.\n\n60\n00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.896\n&gt;&gt; Marked bootable that we'll use for the\noperating system, as you mentioned, and\n\n61\n00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:31.084\nthe extended is the logical\ndrive that more often than not,\n\n62\n00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.310\nhas the information regarding the data and\nthe files that we would then wanna access.\n\n63\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.060\nSo just keeping in mind those things.\n\n64\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.761\nAgain, you'll probably pretty basic for\nmany of us,\n\n65\n00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.180\nsomething that's been there forever and\na day.\n\n66\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.510\nWe take and look at all the time and\njust say, yep, I know what that is,\n\n67\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.000\nbut we may not stop and\nsmell the roses, as they say.\n\n68\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.580\nAnd just think about having to find\nthose things, and walking back\n\n69\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.660\nthrough the mine field of knowledge,\nand making sure we know how to step.\n\n70\n00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.580\nWhere to step without exploding anything.\n\n71\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.510\nBut to make sure we understand the value\nof that knowledge as we look ahead to\n\n72\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.360\nthe exam will be important here.\n\n73\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.420\nWhat about the BIOS parameter block.\n\n74\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.350\nWhat is known as the BPB.\n\n75\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.250\nThis is the data structure\nthat is situated at sector one\n\n76\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.830\nin the volume boot record\nof the hard drive.\n\n77\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.140\nSo we're going to be right, right,\nright at the very beginning there.\n\n78\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.020\nIt explains the physical\nlayout of the disc volume.\n\n79\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.428\nThis is what actually tells us\nhow this disk is laid out and\n\n80\n00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:20.398\nwhere we will find things and\nhow to access it.\n\n81\n00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:25.750\nThe volume partition on partition devices\nsuch as hard disks will be described here.\n\n82\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.080\nWhereas the unpartitioned devices,\nit will describe the entire medium.\n\n83\n00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.260\nIn other words, in an unpartitioned disk,\n\n84\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.490\nthat bios parameters block describes\nthe size of the entire drive overall.\n\n85\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.720\nThis physicality of the entire\nspace that's available.\n\n86\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.270\nWhen we partition it,\nit describes the subset,\n\n87\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.480\nthe allocated amount that\nhas been partitioned and\n\n88\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.470\nit tells us how to read that volume,\nor volumes if there's more than one.\n\n89\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.610\nIf you're dual booting your system, you\nwill have references to different volumes,\n\n90\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.480\ndifferent partitions,\n\n91\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.170\nand you would need to understand that, and\nthat comes from the BIOS parameter block.\n\n92\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.320\nIt's just some information that again,\nmay or may not be obvious to us.\n\n93\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.430\nYou've probably heard of\nthe master boot record before and\n\n94\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.270\nwe've talked about the MBR.\n\n95\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.760\nIt comes up all the time, those of you\nwho may have been doing this for a while,\n\n96\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.330\nmay remember the good old\ndays where we had to reset\n\n97\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.790\nthe MBR as part of the installation\nof an operating system.\n\n98\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.162\nThe good old days, I long work, the days\nof floppy disks and having to fix the MBR\n\n99\n00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:21.485\nto reset and reallocate the partitioning\nso that way we could reinstall an OS.\n\n100\n00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:25.562\nAnd change the actual allocation of space\non the drive without getting an error\n\n101\n00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:29.515\nbecause you would get about halfway\nthrough, I'm thinking like MT4 way,\n\n102\n00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:30.890\nway back in the past.\n\n103\n00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.600\nIf you would reinstall MT4 on top\nof an existing installation and\n\n104\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.450\nyou use the same size partition and\nnot modified in any way, you would get\n\n105\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.235\nan error about half way through when you\ngo to read and start installing the MBR.\n\n106\n00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.610\nWould say, wait,\nthis is supposed to be this and here and\n\n107\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.680\nit's not there anymore and\nit would just die.\n\n108\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.850\nAnd it would not let you install it\nbecause you had to reset the MBR,\n\n109\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.200\nwipe it clean.\n\n110\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.870\nIn other words, reallocate space and\ntell it how to find it.\n\n111\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.080\nAnd so the trick was, you'd have to\nchange the size of the partition,\n\n112\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.350\nforcing an entry into the MBR that\nwould then allow you install.\n\n113\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.850\nThis was the old school\nway of doing things.\n\n114\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.030\nThe new school way is you get\nthe Geek Squad to come and\n\n115\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.981\ntake care all that for you.\n\n116\n00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:06.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't even have to worry about\n\n117\n00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:06.708\nthat anymore, right?\n\n118\n00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.382\nJust call for help, right?\n\n119\n00:05:08.382 --> 00:05:11.123\nSo the MBR is the first sector,\nwhat's called sector zero,\n\n120\n00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:14.805\ndon't confuse this with the bios parameter\nblock remember that's sector one.\n\n121\n00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:18.250\nWhen we say first sector,\nwe always start numbering from zero.\n\n122\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.577\nSo when we say first sector,\nwe actually mean sector zero.\n\n123\n00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:25.125\nBIOS parameter block sector one,\nsecond sector overall even though\n\n124\n00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:29.220\nit is called sector one it's the overall\nsecond sector on the hard drive.\n\n125\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.750\nImportant to keep that in mind to\nkeep that straight otherwise you're\n\n126\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.160\ngonna mix up your zeroes and ones.\n\n127\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.750\nAnd well then you're gonna have twos and\nthrees.\n\n128\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.490\n&gt;&gt; It's super easy for us to do because\nwe are used to starting with one.\n\n129\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.150\n&gt;&gt; We are\n&gt;&gt; That's the first way,\n\n130\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.620\nyou will hose yourself more times\nthan you'll be able to count,\n\n131\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.900\nno pun intended, when it comes to doing\nthat cuz I've done it plenty of time I'm\n\n132\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.080\nsure you have as well\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n133\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.100\njust a standing rule of thumb that,\nyou know,\n\n134\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.580\njust remember anything with a computer\nI tell my students this all the time.\n\n135\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.050\nEverything, without, exception,\nyou start numbering from zero.\n\n136\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.005\nRight, just so you know,\nyou gotta account for that extra one,\n\n137\n00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:00.485\nbecause it's always gonna\nbe zero as opposed to one.\n\n138\n00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.650\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n139\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.980\nAll right, so just master boot record,\nthere are gonna be sector zero.\n\n140\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.790\nFirst sector of data storage device\non the hard drive traditionally.\n\n141\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.800\nInformation there regarding\nthe files on the disk, location,\n\n142\n00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.020\nsize, important data, overall just\nabout how we access data on the drive\n\n143\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.750\nis stored in the master boot record.\n\n144\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.080\nYou wanna screw up somebody's day, go and\nmess around with the master boot record.\n\n145\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.110\nThat's a sure fire way to allow\nthem not to be able to get in.\n\n146\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.530\nBut we can go in, and we can\ncertainly fix the master boot record.\n\n147\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.630\nWe can back it up, we can restore it.\n\n148\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.230\nWe're gonna show you how to do that in\njust a minute using DD and Linux Unix.\n\n149\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.880\nWe could also do it in Windows and\nwe'll talk about how to do that.\n\n150\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.520\nSo we hold the partition\ntable there which references\n\n151\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.620\nthe partitions of the hard drive.\n\n152\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.050\nThat's why the MBR is so important.\n\n153\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.660\n64 bytes in size for that partition table.\n\n154\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.190\nJust so you know, the master boot\ncode as well is going to be there.\n\n155\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.480\nThat implements the ability for\n\n156\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.100\nus to examine the partition table,\nfiguring out what partition is active.\n\n157\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.660\nSo again, if we go back to the idea\nof having a single OS, pretty simple.\n\n158\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.860\nBut what if we have multiple OSes,\nwhich one are we booting?\n\n159\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.420\nWhich one of the partitions is active?\n\n160\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.430\nWhere do we go?\nWell, we have to figure that out, so\n\n161\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.300\nwe have to know that.\n\n162\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.690\nDo you know, by the way, how many physical\npartitions we're allowed to have or\n\n163\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.680\nprimary partition I should\nsay Versus extended?\n\n164\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Primary is four primary partitions, and\nthen extended is four extended, right?\n\n165\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.850\n&gt;&gt; No, you can have more than that.\n\n166\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.570\n&gt;&gt; There's more.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can.\n\n167\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.650\n&gt;&gt; All the way up to the end\nof the alphabet, correct?\n\n168\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\n169\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.390\n&gt;&gt; Up through 22 that would be left\n\n170\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.810\nif you take away the first 4.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n171\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.620\n&gt;&gt; It's true, if you think\n\n172\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.250\nabout that.\n&gt;&gt; It's been\n\n173\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.000\na while since I've done.\n[LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can have 4, but you're\n\n175\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.280\nlimited to 4 primary because we have spots\nessentially allocated out in the NBR for\n\n176\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.640\nthose cuz those are marked out.\nDo you have a, can be used to boot.\n\n177\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.250\nSo there's actually some constraints and\n\n178\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.890\nstructural issues and concerns we have\nto think about and be aware of there.\n\n179\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.100\nWe locate the first sector of the active\npartition with the master boot code,\n\n180\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.330\nload the boot sector copy from\nthe active partition into memory, so\n\n181\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.380\nwe can start parse again and\nloading the kernel.\n\n182\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.550\nWhatever else needs to be loaded for\nthe OS.\n\n183\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.484\nTransfer control to the executable\ncode in the boot sector.\n\n184\n00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:50.369\nWe center transfer control to the OS\nat that point and then the OS boots up.\n\n185\n00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.798\nBut all this is done from\nthe master boot code and\n\n186\n00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:56.261\nthe master boot record in The MBR,\nand then recognizing individual\n\n187\n00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:59.680\nhard drive media with a 32 bit\nindividual disk signature.\n\n188\n00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.450\nSo hard drives can be uniquely identified.\n\n189\n00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.400\nThat's a drive signature that they always\nask you to do in Windows initially\n\n190\n00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.570\nwhen we set it up, right.\n\n191\n00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.770\nAnd configure it,\nthat's what your prompt and\n\n192\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.635\nwe getfFirst time you go\ninto the drive manager.\n\n193\n00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:10.415\nYou ever remember seeing that?\n\n194\n00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:13.885\nWell, you wouldn't know about\nthat because you have a Mac.\n\n195\n00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:15.813\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have a fancy OS with all sorts\n\n196\n00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:16.445\nof stuff.\n\n197\n00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:17.795\nYou have to do that as well in there.\n\n198\n00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:19.635\n&gt;&gt; Listen, I hate the Mac OS.\n\n199\n00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:23.221\nI love the Mac hardware because\nthe Mac hardware is awesome.\n\n200\n00:08:23.221 --> 00:08:25.275\nAnd typically, if I'm in Mac OS.\n\n201\n00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:26.860\n&gt;&gt; I can't disagree with you about that.\n\n202\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.585\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; In Mac OS, I use the Darwin.\n\n203\n00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:29.785\nI jump into the terminal.\n\n204\n00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.395\nOtherwise, I'm in a Linux virtual machine.\n\n205\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.160\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough, but even then, in Linux\n\n206\n00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.740\nyou still have to write a disk signature\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah\n\n207\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.730\n&gt;&gt; I mean it doesn't matter what OS.\n\n208\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter where you get\n\n209\n00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.691\nthe prompt, just how you have to do it,\nbut you're always doing that regardless,\n\n210\n00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:41.642\ndoesn't matter what it is.\n\n211\n00:08:41.642 --> 00:08:42.661\nAll right, so\nwe take a look right here real quick.\n\n212\n00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:45.459\nI told I would show you\nhow to back up they MBR so\n\n213\n00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:49.670\nin UNIX/Linux you can do a back-up or\ncreate a back-up of the MBR.\n\n214\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.383\nYou do need regardless of operating\nsystem, regardless of file system.\n\n215\n00:08:52.383 --> 00:08:56.420\nBut DD is a tool we often refer to,\nit will be used for many things.\n\n216\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.610\nWe use it to create our\nimages forensic images so\n\n217\n00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.080\nwe can actually do assessments and\nlook at data.\n\n218\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.510\nWe'll do that in some of\nthe upcoming hands on episodes.\n\n219\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.300\nBut we DD to do backup and\nrestore so the code for\n\n220\n00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.680\nthat here back up DMBR you can see here.\n\n221\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.420\nLet me just move this over.\n\n222\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.980\nGive me just one second I will just,\nwhoop, let's not do that,\n\n223\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.690\nthat would be bad.\n\n224\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.780\nAnd I'll make it disappear look my\nhands never leave my body while\n\n225\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.455\nwe're doing that.\n\n226\n00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:20.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me do it the old fashioned way,\n\n227\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.060\nlet me do it like that.\n\n228\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.880\nOkay, one second we just back this\noff here and just tab that over so\n\n229\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.940\nyou can see that.\n\n230\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.270\nJust because it's up against\nthe side of the window there and\n\n231\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.380\nit's probably a little bit hard to see.\n\n232\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.860\nAll right, that's probably just a little\nbit easier to see in the middle\n\n233\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.399\nof the screen.\n\n234\n00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:39.738\nSo we back up the MBR, the syntax for\nDDF dev XXX whatever that would be.\n\n235\n00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:44.747\nThe MBR.backup and then BS for bit size\nright of accounts so what are we doing.\n\n236\n00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:49.615\nSo we're just issuing that command,\nexcuse me, let me slow down.\n\n237\n00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:53.271\nWe're issuing that command to be\nable to do the back up in this case,\n\n238\n00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.913\nNBR back up signifies that\nwe are doing a back up.\n\n239\n00:09:55.913 --> 00:09:59.895\nIf we're doing a restore here we\nare going to be able to run the restore.\n\n240\n00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:04.443\nThis way you'll see if MBR backup and then\nwe're specifying where we're going to put\n\n241\n00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:06.923\nit, we're essentially swapping the order.\n\n242\n00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:09.010\nSo the information source is this.\n\n243\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.830\nAnd then the source that we're going\nto write it too will be this path\n\n244\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.260\nwith this amount of bites per sector and\nall this kind of stuff.\n\n245\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.990\nSo we're able to go in and do this in DD.\n\n246\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.716\nOne of the ways to do this,\nwe want to do this in Windows,\n\n247\n00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.720\nI didn't actually preload this.\n\n248\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.830\nBut if you give me just a second,\n\n249\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.410\nwe will type that in and\nI will show you where we can go.\n\n250\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.100\nOr at least one way to do this in Windows.\n\n251\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.164\nThis is, what is that,\n\n252\n00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:37.388\nsysint.no-mdrfix.\n\n253\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.675\nOops, and we're not finding it.\n\n254\n00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:47.802\nSysint.no .MBR fix.\n\n255\n00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:50.780\nThat's what I get for\nnot checking before we did that.\n\n256\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.300\nI will have to find another one for you\nbecause that one is not active right now.\n\n257\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.480\nI didn't check that URL before we actually\nattempted just put to it up for you.\n\n258\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.400\nI'll find another reference,\nit's in the show notes,\n\n259\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.520\nI just thought that one was active.\n\n260\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.730\nI didn't bother to go check.\n\n261\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.160\nWell you could Google on using Google for\nany number of sources.\n\n262\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.050\nI just happened to grab one that I\nfound when I was setting up the notes.\n\n263\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.910\nAnd for\nsome reason it's not there right now.\n\n264\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.660\nJust had to prepare for\nand reset backup and\n\n265\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.170\nrestore the MBR using Windows\nas opposed to DD in Unix Linux.\n\n266\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.890\nSo we'll find a reference for that.\n\n267\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.320\nDaniel, I think,\nis going to try to find one for\n\n268\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.730\nus while I'm talking just to make sure we\ncan add a new one into the notes for you.\n\n269\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.320\nAll right, so we've talked about\nhow to restore the MBR, back it up.\n\n270\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.540\nLet's get back and talk about GUIDs\na little bit and what's called the GPT,\n\n271\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.320\nthe GUID partition table.\n\n272\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.090\nA newer way of thinking about\nthis we may not be using.\n\n273\n00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:41.090\nA traditional MBR.\n\n274\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.850\nWe may be using a GUID partition table.\n\n275\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.460\nIf we're using the UEFI standard for\nbooting, newer systems will often do this.\n\n276\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.170\nAnd so if we are doing that\nwe'll be switching away from\n\n277\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.190\nsome of that old school\ntechnology we were talking about.\n\n278\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.030\nThe GUID itself is a pretty\nstraightforward thought process.\n\n279\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.600\nThe Globally Unique Identifier,\n128-bit unique\n\n280\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.880\nnumber generated by Windows traditionally\nif we're talking about GUIDs.\n\n281\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.810\nWe often refer to them in Windows by the\nWindows OS to identify a specific item.\n\n282\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.660\nUser has a GUID associated with it,\n\n283\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.820\ncomputer account has\na GUID associated with it.\n\n284\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.342\nEverything unique is an object and the\nobject model in Windows will have GUIDs.\n\n285\n00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:20.216\nSo just so you know what a GUID is, the\nGPT, the GUID partition table, is gonna be\n\n286\n00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:25.165\nused, again, as part of the UEFI,\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface,\n\n287\n00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:28.210\nwhich will replace our\nlegacy BIOS systems.\n\n288\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.334\nAre you using a UEFI for that?\n\n289\n00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.\n\n290\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.600\n&gt;&gt; You are, okay.\nSo then you're gonna have a GPT I suppose.\n\n291\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.910\n&gt;&gt; I have GPT, that's correct.\n\n292\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.180\n&gt;&gt; You have a GPT and there you go.\n\n293\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:35.975\n&gt;&gt; I like it a lot.\n\n294\n00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:36.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You like it a lot.\n\n295\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.570\nThat's good option.\n\n296\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.190\nYou have extra for it but\nit's a good option, right?\n\n297\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.220\nNo, I'm only kidding, right?\n\n298\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.690\nBut it does overcome, the GPT overcomes\na lot of limitations we had with the MBR.\n\n299\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.680\nCertain disc size,\ncouldn't get beyond a certain disc size.\n\n300\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.260\nWe come out multi terabyte drives now.\n\n301\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.240\nFor instance, I don't know how\nbit the drive is in that thing.\n\n302\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.310\nBut it may be up to like an exabyte or\nsomething crazy that we can mount, or\n\n303\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.830\neven higher than that.\n\n304\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.990\nSo we overcome a lot of\nthe limitations there.\n\n305\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.470\nWe overcome the limitations\nof partition sizes,\n\n306\n00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.770\na lot of things MBR was stuck with,\nwe kind of have overcome with that.\n\n307\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.120\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n308\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.060\nOf the GPTs as LBA, logical block\naddressing, as we talked about\n\n309\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.170\ninstead of cylinder-head-sector\naddressing differences between these two.\n\n310\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.930\nRemember CHS,\n\n311\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:22.170\nprior episode would have been used on IDE\ndrives older drives, LBA on newer drives.\n\n312\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.460\nSo we're gonna see that.\n\n313\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.570\nLBA zero which would be the kind\nof the equivalent of the MBR\n\n314\n00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.920\nsector stores what's\ncalled a protective MBR.\n\n315\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.280\nWe still have an MBR reference and a GPT.\n\n316\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.280\nBut it's different than\nthe traditional MBR.\n\n317\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.800\nThe protective MBR is what\nwe call this file we use to\n\n318\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.460\nbe able to store allocation information\nencrypt backwards compatibility.\n\n319\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.060\nIn case we decide to use different OSs in\nthe drive, and to a variety of things.\n\n320\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.160\nWe still have that kind of a reference.\n\n321\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.030\nBut it's use specifically only for\ncertain things today.\n\n322\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.040\nSo ALBA0 stores to protect the MBR.\n\n323\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.998\nLBA 1 contains the GPT header, right.\n\n324\n00:13:56.998 --> 00:14:01.618\nWhere the traditional MBR would sit\nrather than, excuse me where the,\n\n325\n00:14:01.618 --> 00:14:06.700\nnot the traditional MBR which where\nthe bios boots sector would sit, right?\n\n326\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.550\nThat would be one, right,\nstill be the second sector.\n\n327\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.530\nAnd then the GPT header comprises\na pointer and a partition table or\n\n328\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.270\nwhat's called a PEA, a partition\nentry array that is gonna get LB2 or\n\n329\n00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.010\nthe third sector in the drive.\n\n330\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.960\nSo we have zero, one, and two allocated\nfor very specific things using our GPT.\n\n331\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.230\nAnd then as a result,\nwe're able to go in and\n\n332\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.010\nwe're able to allocated out some\nadditional stuff, zero through two.\n\n333\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:37.473\nSo three through 33 LBA sectors are used\nto various administrative set up and\n\n334\n00:14:37.473 --> 00:14:39.720\ncontrol elements in the drive.\n\n335\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.778\nAnd then LBA 34 is the first\nusable sector on a GPT drive.\n\n336\n00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:47.740\nAnd then from there we kinda go out,\nand start allocating space as a result.\n\n337\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.275\nSo if you're asked for any reason,\nhey what's the first usable sector in\n\n338\n00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:56.096\nthe drive that is based or\nset up with GPT, it will be LBA 34.\n\n339\n00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:59.500\nZero is allocated out, one is\nallocated out, two is allocated out,\n\n340\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.410\nother things allocated in there.\n\n341\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.930\nBut zero, one and two are the most\nlikely ones you will come across.\n\n342\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.775\nBut LBA 34 is the first usable\nsector on the GPT drive.\n\n343\n00:15:07.775 --> 00:15:08.560\nMay or may not have known that.\n\n344\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.608\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that actually.\n\n345\n00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Now you know that,\nin case somebody asks.\n\n346\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.175\n&gt;&gt; And knowing is,\nwell this battle anyway.\n\n347\n00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:14.785\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well knowing is knowing, right?\n\n348\n00:15:14.785 --> 00:15:16.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Knowing is knowing.\n\n349\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.870\n&gt;&gt; As I said, partitions in the MBR space,\nold school, right?\n\n350\n00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.150\nWe were limited in size now with GPT.\n\n351\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.600\nWe could add partitions and partition\ndisks out larger than two terabytes,\n\n352\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.720\nup to two terabytes and beyond.\n\n353\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.780\nSo you could have large partitions.\n\n354\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.405\nWe could have 128 partitions in Windows\nusing the GPT partition layout.\n\n355\n00:15:33.405 --> 00:15:36.850\nWhich, not that you would probably get\nthat far, but it's good to know that,\n\n356\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.930\nin theory, if you had nothing to do.\n\n357\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Go partition crazy.\n\n358\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.830\n&gt;&gt; You could go partition crazy.\n\n359\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.628\nWe can also, actually consider this to\nbe a more secure storage mechanism.\n\n360\n00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:51.975\nGPT will store the partition data and\nthe bootable data across the drive.\n\n361\n00:15:51.975 --> 00:15:55.448\nIt kind of scatters it, doesn't\nnecessarily lay it all out sequentially.\n\n362\n00:15:55.448 --> 00:15:58.900\nAddress space, layout randomization\nis a concept, is what we see there.\n\n363\n00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.481\nBecause we store multiple locations, or\n\n364\n00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:02.660\nmultiple locations is what\nwe use to store data.\n\n365\n00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.420\nAs a result it's a center more secure,\n\n366\n00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.368\nbecause we're not just storing everything\nkind of in lock steps sequentially.\n\n367\n00:16:07.368 --> 00:16:10.845\nSo, we're saying hey sectors five, ten,\nfive through ten, or five through 11\n\n368\n00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:14.465\nwill be this data if we just know that\nthe map of the drives says it's there.\n\n369\n00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:16.614\nWe could go grab it in the old school way.\n\n370\n00:16:16.614 --> 00:16:20.595\nAnd BR and the older systems, so\nit makes a little bit more secure.\n\n371\n00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:21.255\nNot just that,\n\n372\n00:16:21.255 --> 00:16:24.005\nthere's a lot of other things that have\nto go on to make it more secure, but\n\n373\n00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:28.195\njust knowing that that is a byproduct\nan extra added capability if you will.\n\n374\n00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:31.743\nWe also use CRC, Cyclic Redundancy Checks\nto ensure integrity.\n\n375\n00:16:31.743 --> 00:16:35.879\nCRC is just another way of talking about\nan error control and correction mechanism.\n\n376\n00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:38.080\nA hashing that will be used for integrity.\n\n377\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.110\nAnd we use CRC 32 that checks some,\nspecifically to look for\n\n378\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.730\nerrors in the partition table and\nflag them, and correct them.\n\n379\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.232\nSo we have some additional capabilities\nthat we just want to make sure we're aware\n\n380\n00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:48.868\nof I talked about the protective MBR.\n\n381\n00:16:48.868 --> 00:16:53.063\nJust wanna remind you, this is where\nlegacy tools are gonna bind to and\n\n382\n00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:57.430\nsolve compatibility issues when\nthey fail to read the GPT format.\n\n383\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.102\nWe make it clear when you start to format\nthe drive, and you probably saw this when\n\n384\n00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:03.861\nyou did your install,\nyou gotta choose, either GPT or MBR.\n\n385\n00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:06.341\nAnd as you often say, right,\ndon't choose poorly, choose wisely, right?\n\n386\n00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:07.435\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nChoose wisely.\n\n387\n00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:10.738\n&gt;&gt; So we have to choose because\nwhen we do that we are now reading\n\n388\n00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:15.302\nthe partition table using a GPT format,\nwhich means older legacy tools will not be\n\n389\n00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.460\nable to read it if there's no MBR and\nMBR reference.\n\n390\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.420\nThe protected MBR we talked about\nis that bridge that helps us\n\n391\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.500\nto understand what's in the system and\nunderstand what's there for\n\n392\n00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.950\ntool sets that don't understand or\nwork with or know what the GPT form is.\n\n393\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.320\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n394\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.770\nThis gives us the startup code for\n\n395\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.240\nthe operating system that\nsupports the GPT boot disc.\n\n396\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.826\nMakes it available for\nus, allows us to see that.\n\n397\n00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:42.594\nSo it will give us things, or give us\nthe backwards capability for us to access.\n\n398\n00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:47.360\nThink about the old MS-DOS fdisk,\nthere's an oldie for you, right?\n\n399\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.550\nOr the Windows NT Disk Administrator,\ntools like that old, right?\n\n400\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.360\nThat kind of stuff that read the MBR.\n\n401\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.500\nThey wouldn't understand the GBT, but the\nprotective MBR helps them in theory if you\n\n402\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.165\nhad a reason to, would help them\nto interact and to be aware of it.\n\n403\n00:18:00.165 --> 00:18:02.130\nCuz they won't be aware of\nthe grid partition table,\n\n404\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.230\nthey won't read what they don't understand\nit, they won't be able to access it.\n\n405\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.760\nSo as a result, they'll interpret\nthe drive as being a bad drive or\n\n406\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.230\nhaving nothing on it,\nthey just won't know it's there.\n\n407\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.791\nSo legacy software that won't be able to\ndo that accesses MBR the protected MBR or\n\n408\n00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:20.032\nis given access to the protected MBR\nthrough its interaction with the GPT.\n\n409\n00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:24.021\nThese tools view the grid partition\ntable as being a single encompassing,\n\n410\n00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:27.631\nmost likely possibly unrecognized,\nprobably unreadable form and\n\n411\n00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:31.890\nas a result of that they don't mistake\nthe disc for one that is on partition.\n\n412\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.260\nBut rather see it as having an operating\nsystem when they use the protective MBR.\n\n413\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.840\nSo, it prevents us from damaging the disk\n\n414\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.050\nby thinking there's nothing\nthere trying to overwrite it.\n\n415\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:46.200\nThe Protective MBR is kind of that\nremote or rather what am I thinking of?\n\n416\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.230\nInteroperability, so\n\n417\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.290\nbackwards compatibility is what\nI was trying to come up with.\n\n418\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.120\nThat backwards compatibility thought\nprocess that allows older tools\n\n419\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.300\nto look at the drive and\nat least know there's something there and\n\n420\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.300\nnot mess with it if you wanna\njust think about it that way.\n\n421\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.280\nSo it's important just for\nus to know about that.\n\n422\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.770\nNow the partitioning standards and\n\n423\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.140\nthe functional information about that,\nkind of interesting.\n\n424\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.630\nIt comes to us from there's actually\na working group that does this,\n\n425\n00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.480\nit's the extensible firmware\ninterface specification that defines\n\n426\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.620\nGUID partitioning and all that.\n\n427\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.700\nIf you give me one second I\nwill bring that up for you.\n\n428\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.920\nJust let me grab the URI.\n\n429\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.680\nI know this one is actually good\nbecause I did check this one.\n\n430\n00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.830\nI just have the grab it with my mouse.\n\n431\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.170\nBut it will be off of\nthis website right here.\n\n432\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.144\nIt's actually a PDF that\nyou can go look at.\n\n433\n00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:33.400\nJust give me one second to\nload that into IE for us.\n\n434\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.530\nThere we go, right there.\n\n435\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.930\nAnd there we go.\n\n436\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.600\nAnd so\nour PDF should come up here momentarily.\n\n437\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.294\nAnd the UEFI org standard,\nthis is the most recent one,\n\n438\n00:19:47.294 --> 00:19:50.502\nSpec Version 2.7 was recently released and\nupdated.\n\n439\n00:19:50.502 --> 00:19:53.841\nYeah, they go through revisions every so\noften, so if you wanna see this,\n\n440\n00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:56.580\nyou'll see May of 2017, relatively recent.\n\n441\n00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.980\nAnd you'll see here that if we go through,\njust get through the initial stuff here\n\n442\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.740\nand all the way through the beginning,\nyou can see all the table on contents but\n\n443\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.000\nSection five is actually\nwhere we're going to go.\n\n444\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.030\nAnd see the information about that,\njust scroll back here, in 20s.\n\n445\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.730\nAnd we'll see that we can actually find\nthe GUID partitioning information there,\n\n446\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.228\nit's protocols.\n\n447\n00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:26.290\nThere's storage there's all that stuff,\nand there's seven,\n\n448\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.360\nthere's six, there's four.\n\n449\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.470\nThere it is right there, the GUID\npartition table disk layout section five,\n\n450\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.733\ncan actually go in and\nwe can just read up on that.\n\n451\n00:20:35.733 --> 00:20:39.320\nZero format, legacy master boot\nrecord protecting master boot record,\n\n452\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.560\nall that kind of stuff is there.\n\n453\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.500\nYou would just have to go read\nthe technical standard, again,\n\n454\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.170\nif you're interested.\n\n455\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.850\nNo reason for you to go do that.\n\n456\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.710\nI'm not suggesting you have to for\npurposes of the exam.\n\n457\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.092\nBut certainly, for purposes of being\nin the field working with GPT and\n\n458\n00:20:51.092 --> 00:20:54.257\nunderstanding the structural\narchitectural design elements.\n\n459\n00:20:54.257 --> 00:20:57.987\nAnd essentially owner's manual for\nhow this functionality is created,\n\n460\n00:20:57.987 --> 00:20:59.680\nyou may wanna take a look at this.\n\n461\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.421\nIt is 2,899 pages.\n\n462\n00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:04.300\nSo it is a little bit of reading.\n\n463\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.340\nBut you would want to take a look.\n\n464\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.393\nWe're on page 195.\n\n465\n00:21:07.393 --> 00:21:09.030\nIt is section five, right?\n\n466\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.290\nAnd I reference that in the show\nnotes that it is section five in\n\n467\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.340\nthe current standard.\n\n468\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.557\nDepending on when you see this, of course.\n\n469\n00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:17.181\nIf you're watching this in 2020 and\nthis was shot in 2017,\n\n470\n00:21:17.181 --> 00:21:19.590\nthey may have updated the standard again.\n\n471\n00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.610\nWho knows?\nAnd obviously,\n\n472\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.180\nthat URL may have to be parsed and\nyou'll have to go out and look for\n\n473\n00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.320\na newer updated version.\n\n474\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.536\nBut as we did suggest, that url will\ntake you to, this current version and\n\n475\n00:21:28.536 --> 00:21:30.927\nthat current version is version 2.7.\n\n476\n00:21:30.927 --> 00:21:32.216\nJust so you are aware of that.\n\n477\n00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:34.300\nAll right so, just so\nyou know a little bit about that.\n\n478\n00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.700\nSo what are some of the files that\nmake up the windows file system.\n\n479\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.440\nAre we talking about file systems.\n\n480\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.930\nWhat are some of those\nessential files,important for\n\n481\n00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.460\nus to be aware of what they are and\nto have a sense of them,\n\n482\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.300\nthere are many of them, but we can often\npoint to a certain number of ones.\n\n483\n00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.463\nThat will be helpful if you wanna take\na look on the screen with me here.\n\n484\n00:21:50.463 --> 00:21:51.672\nHave a list there for you.\n\n485\n00:21:51.672 --> 00:21:55.670\nNTOS kernel.exe, emptykernel.pa,\n\n486\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:00.496\nhal.dll been around forever and\na day, right.\n\n487\n00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:05.024\nWin32.cis, ntdll.dll, we've got kernel32,\n\n488\n00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:09.240\nthat be 32, user32, gdi32, all .dll.\n\n489\n00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.718\nThese are the essential Windows files,\nright?\n\n490\n00:22:11.718 --> 00:22:15.016\nYou got 2, 4, 6, 8,\nabout 9 almost 10 of them there.\n\n491\n00:22:15.016 --> 00:22:17.581\nIf you were asked on an exam for\ninstance hypothetically, hey,\n\n492\n00:22:17.581 --> 00:22:19.300\nwhat are those files we\nhave to be aware of?\n\n493\n00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.618\nWhat are the ones we should know about?\n\n494\n00:22:20.618 --> 00:22:22.610\nThose would definitely be on my hit list.\n\n495\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.770\nI'd wanna know those.\n\n496\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.500\nMajority of them are DLL files,\nonly one sys file, two exe files.\n\n497\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.830\nSo study accordingly.\n\n498\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.360\nGreat opportunity to make some flash\ncards perhaps and just be aware of those.\n\n499\n00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.470\nWould not go into great detail\nabout what each file does,\n\n500\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.270\nthis is not a Windows exam.\n\n501\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.480\nKeep that in mind.\n\n502\n00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.970\nBut it is important as an investigator to\nknow that those are the kind of files that\n\n503\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.140\nwe want to make sure are there and\nif they have been modified or\n\n504\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.550\nin anyway are damaged.\n\n505\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.980\nWe would have to take note of that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n506\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.690\nThe other thing that comes\nup that is often discuss and\n\n507\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.578\nwe're gonna run through\nhere with you right now.\n\n508\n00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:54.390\nIs what are the steps in the boot\nprocess for various OSs, for\n\n509\n00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.780\nWindows, for Linux, for the Mac OS.\n\n510\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.650\nDetailed out for you what those steps are.\n\n511\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.240\nGonna be important for\nyou to be aware of them.\n\n512\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.010\nSo the Windows boot process right here\nWindows XP, Vista, Windows 7 etc.\n\n513\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.090\nHow do they start up?\n\n514\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.900\nIf we have Windows 8 forward we will have\neither remember the traditional BIOS based\n\n515\n00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.420\nMBR or the newer UEFI GPT\nmethod we just discussed.\n\n516\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.110\nBut regardless what\nare the steps involved.\n\n517\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:22.193\nSo once the system is powered on right\nwhat do we go through to boot Windows up.\n\n518\n00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:25.620\nWe got 11, actually 13 steps here.\n\n519\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.926\nSo we'll go through,\nI'll roll past the first few and\n\n520\n00:23:27.926 --> 00:23:29.541\nbring up the last couple here as we go.\n\n521\n00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.365\nBut it would be good for\nyou to have a sense of the boot steps or\n\n522\n00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:34.297\nthe boot process involved IOS.\n\n523\n00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:38.578\nI'm not suggesting you have to know all\n13, but I am suggesting that breaking it\n\n524\n00:23:38.578 --> 00:23:42.176\ndown into this kind of ordered sequenced\nnumber of steps may be more or\n\n525\n00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:45.486\nless detailed depending on your\nparticular thought process.\n\n526\n00:23:45.486 --> 00:23:48.074\nWould be a good idea if you're\nplanning on taking the exam.\n\n527\n00:23:48.074 --> 00:23:51.829\nAlso in the real world, keep in mind Are\nwe really worried about the boot process\n\n528\n00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:53.354\nthat often as an investigator?\n\n529\n00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:55.210\nIt's certainly important\nto be aware of it.\n\n530\n00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.670\nThere may be files that have\nbeen modified or damaged and\n\n531\n00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.560\nwe would have to go in and figure out that\nwe need to know what step in the process,\n\n532\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.960\nwe already know about that.\n\n533\n00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.400\nBut we don't often deal with the boot\nprocess of a system cuz we're not normally\n\n534\n00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.160\nbooting the system when we're\ninvestigating and it's already started up.\n\n535\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.640\nWe're capturing dynamic and\n\n536\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.740\nvolatile evidence,\nwe're then probably gonna shut it down.\n\n537\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.270\nWe're going to go work off\nthe image copies we have.\n\n538\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.170\nWe may never start that system\nup again while it's in storage\n\n539\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.600\nbecause we don't want to damage or\nin any way modify the data.\n\n540\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.770\nSo chances are good,\n\n541\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.580\nwe're not going to really deal\nwith the boot process that often.\n\n542\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.680\nBut do we deal with it when we are doing\ninternal investigations around\n\n543\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.040\nthings like malware incidents, things\nlike that, yeah we may need to, right?\n\n544\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.160\nThat may come up.\n\n545\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.380\nSo knowledge of it wouldn't be a bad idea,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n546\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.290\nAll right having said that if we could\ngo back let's take a quick look here.\n\n547\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.220\nI'm going to leave the reading to you\nin the sense that you have the complete\n\n548\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.620\nlist of this in the show notes.\n\n549\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.130\nYou go through it in detail,\nwe'll just hit the high points here.\n\n550\n00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.030\nWhen we switch on the CPU\nsends a power good signal out,\n\n551\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.420\nmeaning hey we're ready for business let's\ncheck the BIOS and let's get started.\n\n552\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.800\nWe go into our traditional post.\n\n553\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.460\nYou guys hopefully are familiar\nwith the power on self test.\n\n554\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.370\nWe check to make sure all\nthe hardware's available.\n\n555\n00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.170\nEverything is good.\n\n556\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.360\nFirmware is there.\n\n557\n00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.260\nWe're gonna load that from the\nnon-volatile memory on the motherboard.\n\n558\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.765\nWe call that the CMOS traditionally.\n\n559\n00:25:04.765 --> 00:25:05.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Just so you know.\n\n560\n00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:10.665\nIf post is successful, meaning we are able\nto get past that, the CMOS is good,\n\n561\n00:25:10.665 --> 00:25:12.525\nthe battery's good, all that kinda stuff.\n\n562\n00:25:12.525 --> 00:25:16.326\nAdd on adaptors are done to integrate or\ncheck integration for the system.\n\n563\n00:25:16.326 --> 00:25:17.505\nHey we need this or that.\n\n564\n00:25:17.505 --> 00:25:19.700\nGotta start initializing things.\n\n565\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.620\nWe hopefully detect\na valid boot system disk.\n\n566\n00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.290\nThat happens typically\nright there in step four.\n\n567\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.860\nSo, one of the things that may\ncome up in a question is hey,\n\n568\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.220\nin what step in the Windows boot\nprocess do we actually check and\n\n569\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.760\nvalidate the system boot disk so\nwe can start reading?\n\n570\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.180\nFrom the boot disk and\nstart interacting with it.\n\n571\n00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.960\nStep four would be that thought process.\n\n572\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.740\nSo again,\n\n573\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.670\npicking up things that may be valuable\nin that boot order would be helpful.\n\n574\n00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.440\nAfter the post there\nwe'll just scroll down so\n\n575\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.900\nyou could just see the 13th\nstep down there at the bottom.\n\n576\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.640\nAfter the post we can the boot disk.\n\n577\n00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.728\nWe load the MBR.\n\n578\n00:25:49.728 --> 00:25:53.680\nAnother great question, hey when do we\nload the MBR in the Windows boot process?\n\n579\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.370\nRight after we check to see if we\nhave a valid system boot disk, right.\n\n580\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.520\nThose kind of things will be things\nthat I would focus on if I was you.\n\n581\n00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.721\nAnd there we are looking for boot\nconfiguration data of the NBR triggers,\n\n582\n00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:07.397\nyou know again, questions about,\nhey what is the NBR trigger?\n\n583\n00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:11.300\nWhat is that then locate and load\nthe executables boot manager with load.\n\n584\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.630\nI probably want to know\nthose if I was you.\n\n585\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.380\nWindows loader, loads the OS\nkernel which is the mtoskrel.exe\n\n586\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.800\none of those files that we talked about.\n\n587\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.920\nOnce that is running, we then load\nthe HAL.DLL the boot-class device drivers,\n\n588\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.780\nmarked as BOOT_START in the system\nregistry hive in memory.\n\n589\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.100\nProbably wanted to know\nwhat order that happens in.\n\n590\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.965\nWe pass control from the Kernel over\nto the Session Manager Process called\n\n591\n00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:35.810\nSMSS.exe.\n\n592\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.960\nAgain, although it's not on my list\nof nine must-know files for Windows,\n\n593\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.635\nyou should probably wanna know that,\njust be aware of that.\n\n594\n00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:47.130\nSMSS.exe loads all the registry hives and\n\n595\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.230\nall the drivers that are required by\nthe Win32 subsystem that allow us\n\n596\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.140\nto essentially create Windows,\nthe operational environment and run.\n\n597\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.595\nSo we do wanna be aware of that and\nknow that.\n\n598\n00:26:56.595 --> 00:26:59.515\nThe session manager then\ntriggers winlogon, which is\n\n599\n00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:03.915\nwhat is used to actually present the user\ninterface in the GUI so you can log on.\n\n600\n00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:05.917\nAnother great step, what's the executable?\n\n601\n00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.205\nAnother great question, rather.\n\n602\n00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:11.213\nWhat's the executable that we get in\norder to present the GUI in Windows, and\n\n603\n00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:14.186\nroughly around what step in\nthe process does that occur?\n\n604\n00:27:14.186 --> 00:27:19.565\nWould occur after SMS.ext initializes\nthe 132 subsystem, and the registry hive.\n\n605\n00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:21.211\nAnd it's called windlogon, and\n\n606\n00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:24.282\nthese are question that I could\npotentially see being asked.\n\n607\n00:27:24.282 --> 00:27:26.122\nAnd that I'd wanna know answers to.\n\n608\n00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:28.830\nNot saying they're gonna be asked,\nnot indicating they would be.\n\n609\n00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.363\nJust saying if I was writing the exam,\nthese are the kind of things I would ask.\n\n610\n00:27:32.363 --> 00:27:33.985\nAnd I would wanna know that you know.\n\n611\n00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:37.421\nBecause if I am expecting you to be\nknowledgeable about a boot process,\n\n612\n00:27:37.421 --> 00:27:41.489\nthen you better believe I'm gonna pick out\nthe minutia of what the executables are,\n\n613\n00:27:41.489 --> 00:27:44.033\nwhat order they operate in,\nwhat they're tied to.\n\n614\n00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.670\nSo I can tell that you know the process.\n\n615\n00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.830\nAt least that's what I would\nwanna evaluate anyway.\n\n616\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.530\nThankfully, I'm not\nthe one writing the exams.\n\n617\n00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.350\nWorks out well for you.\n\n618\n00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.970\nAll right so anyway you get the idea, here\nsession manager passes control over to\n\n619\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.200\nthe service control manager,\nwhich then starts the sub system VL.\n\n620\n00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.600\nSASS subsystem which is gonna execute the\nsecurity in group policy functionality in\n\n621\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.720\nthe Windows environment, just so you know.\n\n622\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.410\nOnce a user logs in we\nhave a user created for\n\n623\n00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.870\nthat session and then the service manager,\nservice control manager\n\n624\n00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.320\nstarts the explore.exe which where\nwe actually get our desktop from.\n\n625\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.400\nHave you ever killed explorer?\n\n626\n00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.870\nWell you probably don't\ncuz you don't use Windows.\n\n627\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.300\n&gt;&gt; No, I've done it.\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever killed explorer.exe?\n\n628\n00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.270\nWhere you generate, right?\n\n629\n00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.283\nYou do that something hangs.\n\n630\n00:28:20.283 --> 00:28:21.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's very helpful.\n\n631\n00:28:21.168 --> 00:28:22.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you just kill everything and\n\n632\n00:28:22.757 --> 00:28:25.940\nthen you just respawn all you do is\ngo into control or task manager.\n\n633\n00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n634\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Spawn explorer.exe,\nrun a brand new process.\n\n635\n00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.970\nIt's one of the favorites for malware to\nlatch onto, right, where recreates it.\n\n636\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.740\nIt has its own version of that and\n\n637\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.710\nkinda slides the real version off to the\nnonsense, so you can't access it, right?\n\n638\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.140\nSo it's a very buggery\nthing to have to deal with.\n\n639\n00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you kill it,\n\n640\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.590\nin theory, you put a stake right\nin the heart of the malware.\n\n641\n00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.440\nAssuming that it doesn't spawn again,\n\n642\n00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.660\nbecause it's sitting in\na repository memory.\n\n643\n00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.990\nIt says wait a second,\nand it comes right back.\n\n644\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.100\nThat's why root kits are so nasty, right?\n\n645\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.100\nBecause they have that level of control.\n\n646\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.770\nThey just scoff at you the whole time.\n\n647\n00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.210\nThey're like, you can't kill me.\n\n648\n00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.590\nI'll mess you up, I'll kill you.\n\n649\n00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.250\n&gt;&gt; And if you delete me,\nI'll just reinstall myself.\n\n650\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.440\nThat's always a fun one.\n\n651\n00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's why we like malware.\n\n652\n00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It's very cool.\n\n653\n00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.350\nAll right, so you saw the note\nfile with the EFI Boot Manager.\n\n654\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.510\nI wanna talk about the UEFI boot process.\n\n655\n00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.150\nFive phases for that, as well.\n\n656\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.130\nSo let's take a look at that if we could.\n\n657\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.040\nAnd we'll see here.\n\n658\n00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.910\nWe have the SEC or\nwhat's called security phase,\n\n659\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.850\nthe PEI pre-EFI initialization phase.\n\n660\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.670\nWe have the DXE,\nthe Driver Execution Environment phase.\n\n661\n00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.850\nWe have the BDS,\nthe Boot Device Selection phase.\n\n662\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.400\nAnd we have the RT or Run Time phase.\n\n663\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.290\nAgain, it would be helpful for\n\n664\n00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.170\nyou to have a sense of the five phases\nassociated with the UEFI process.\n\n665\n00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.160\nThe Security Phase does the initialization\ncode the system executes after\n\n666\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.130\npowering off.\n\n667\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.110\nThis is the equivalent\nof doing the post and\n\n668\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.760\nthe general check in\nthe Windows environment,\n\n669\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.090\nmanages platform reset events so\nthat we find, validate, install and run.\n\n670\n00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.079\nThe PEI,\nwhich is the Pre-EFI Initialization.\n\n671\n00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:59.170\nThat's where we initialize CPU,\ntemp memory, the boot firmware.\n\n672\n00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.440\nWe locate and execute the modules\nassociated with functionality.\n\n673\n00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.820\nThen we finally create\na hand off block list,\n\n674\n00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.820\nwhich is then handed off to\nthe driver execution environment.\n\n675\n00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:14.480\nThe DXE, which is where we load majority\nof the drivers of ours to initialize.\n\n676\n00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.690\nAccess of the physical memory.\n\n677\n00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.030\nThe memory is mapped,\nthe MIMO takes place,\n\n678\n00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:23.280\nthe memory input or memory mapped\ninput output table is created.\n\n679\n00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.480\nResources are finally being able to\nlatch on or be latched onto by drivers.\n\n680\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.130\nThis is where we're starting to load\nthe equivalent of the registry in Win 32\n\n681\n00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.100\nsubsystems, right?\n\n682\n00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.760\nIn Windows that kind of stuff.\n\n683\n00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.640\nAnd then, or excuse me, not quite that yet\n\n684\n00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.890\nbut we're getting into\nthe hardware selection subset.\n\n685\n00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.475\nThe NTOS Kernel and things like\nthat are being prepped for loading.\n\n686\n00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:42.920\nThat comes a step later.\n\n687\n00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.740\nThen we have the BDS,\nthe Boot Device Selection.\n\n688\n00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.370\nBoot delection is what I was about to say.\n\n689\n00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.580\nThe boot device selection.\n\n690\n00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm editing Wikipedia right now.\n\n691\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n692\n00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.930\nHe said it was boot delection,\nthat's gotta be what we put out there.\n\n693\n00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.099\n&gt;&gt; What the heck does delection mean?\n\n694\n00:30:57.099 --> 00:30:58.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, but it sounded good so\n\n695\n00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.810\nthat's what we went with.\n\n696\n00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.150\nThe boot device selection, right?\n\n697\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.480\nSo this is gonna interpret\nthe boot config data.\n\n698\n00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.780\nSet up the policy or\nselect the policy rather for\n\n699\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.270\nlater implementation in the runtime phase.\n\n700\n00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.420\nThis phase works off of the drivers that\nwere loaded in the driver execution phase\n\n701\n00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.650\nbefore there, and we provide\nthe ability to be able to in and to be\n\n702\n00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:22.270\nable to load the boot loader program, so\nthat'll actually allow us to load the OS.\n\n703\n00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.520\nAnd then the runtime phase clears\nthe UEFI program from memory and\n\n704\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.350\ntransfers over to the OS.\n\n705\n00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.140\nThis is where we asses their handing\noff and allowing the LS to kick in and\n\n706\n00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.070\nto start the process.\n\n707\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:36.320\nSo I just want to make sure we're aware\nof how that boot process runs again.\n\n708\n00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.263\nIt may be new to some of us and it may\nnot be something we are familiar with but\n\n709\n00:31:40.263 --> 00:31:44.412\nit is something that we do want to make\nsure we are aware of just so that we know.\n\n710\n00:31:44.412 --> 00:31:48.165\nThere are some ways we can go in,\nby the way, in windows and\n\n711\n00:31:48.165 --> 00:31:50.705\nsome ways that we can identify the GPT.\n\n712\n00:31:50.705 --> 00:31:52.306\nIf there is one that is there.\n\n713\n00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:56.625\nWe use the Get-GPT commandlet which will\nanalyze the GUID partition table and\n\n714\n00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.170\nshow us what's there.\n\n715\n00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Really quickly, Adam.\n\n716\n00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:03.030\nIs that something that, that Get-GPT\ncommand, is that built into our PowerShell\n\n717\n00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:07.095\nby default, or is that something\nthat's from a third party?\n\n718\n00:32:07.095 --> 00:32:08.375\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually a great question.\n\n719\n00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:11.993\nSo the Get-GBT command, along with\na couple of others that we'll just quickly\n\n720\n00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:15.449\nshow you here, are actually part of\na PowerShell forensics commandlet pack\n\n721\n00:32:15.449 --> 00:32:18.262\nthat somebody's created and\nyou would have to go out and get.\n\n722\n00:32:18.262 --> 00:32:20.482\nAnd actually,\nit's pretty cool little set of functions.\n\n723\n00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:22.542\nIf you join me here we'll\nactually just take a quick look.\n\n724\n00:32:22.542 --> 00:32:24.552\nYou could see from the Invoke-IR site.\n\n725\n00:32:24.552 --> 00:32:27.382\nIf you haven't been there,\nit's a great site to go out to.\n\n726\n00:32:27.382 --> 00:32:30.892\nOne of the guys involved with\nSam's actually maintains it.\n\n727\n00:32:30.892 --> 00:32:34.762\nAnd on the forensics trail of the GUD\npartition table he wrote a series of posts\n\n728\n00:32:34.762 --> 00:32:35.742\nabout this.\n\n729\n00:32:35.742 --> 00:32:37.372\nGoes into a little bit of the detail here.\n\n730\n00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:39.852\nIt's a three part miniseries\n\n731\n00:32:39.852 --> 00:32:43.690\non the forensic functionality\nthat's been created here.\n\n732\n00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.390\nHe created this PowerShell forensics\n\n733\n00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.000\nmodule called power forensics\nyou could download.\n\n734\n00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.830\nGet the information of the website if you\nwanna use it, and you could actually go\n\n735\n00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.400\nahead and use this as part of your\nforensic investigative tool kit,\n\n736\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.612\nwhich is actually really cool.\n\n737\n00:32:56.612 --> 00:32:58.320\nSo it just goes into a little detail here,\n\n738\n00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.470\ntalks about some of the stuff we already\nspoke about with the grid partition table,\n\n739\n00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.810\nthe protective MBR is there, it gives\nyou a nice little overview of that.\n\n740\n00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:10.810\nThen talks about how the cmdlets work,\nthe Get-GPT header cmdlet\n\n741\n00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:15.390\nthat we were talking about, so get GPT\nrather, not the GPT Header but Get-GPT.\n\n742\n00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:19.900\nSo down here the PowerShell or\nPowerForensics Cmdlets Get GPT is here,\n\n743\n00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.940\nit talks a bit about this and\nhow it works.\n\n744\n00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.530\nGives you a little insight here, shows\nyou what the output would look like and\n\n745\n00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.600\nhow it would work.\n\n746\n00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.580\nSo it actually walks you\nthrough the logic of it.\n\n747\n00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.055\nGet BootSector, one of the other\ncmdlets that's available as well,\n\n748\n00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:36.910\nlets you go in and\nactually interact with and\n\n749\n00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.910\nfind information about the hard drives for\nsector, determine the formatting, and\n\n750\n00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.920\nthen Get PartitionTable will go in and\nallow you to determine the type of\n\n751\n00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.950\nthe boot sector and the GUID Partition\ntable and show all that.\n\n752\n00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.300\nSo these commandlets are available,\nyou'd have to download the module,\n\n753\n00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.000\nimplement it the way you would\nany module by importing it.\n\n754\n00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.940\nYou could certainly follow the basic\ninstructions available on the site if you\n\n755\n00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.780\nwanna do that.\n\n756\n00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.850\nURLs in the show notes,\nas it always is for you.\n\n757\n00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.770\nBut this is a brand-newer\nkind of concept for you.\n\n758\n00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.680\nIt was first launched\naround mid to late 2015.\n\n759\n00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.840\nSo it's been out there for\na little bit now.\n\n760\n00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.550\nProbably not exam specific,\n\n761\n00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.970\nI wouldn't necessarily worry about it for\nthe CHFI exam.\n\n762\n00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.380\nIt's really just more real world stuff for\nyou just to be aware of to use in\n\n763\n00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.930\na Windows environment and just another\nset of tools that you can bring to bear,\n\n764\n00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:23.190\nespecially if you're PowerShell centric\nwith regards to this functionality.\n\n765\n00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.570\nSo pretty cool little stuff\nif you're interested.\n\n766\n00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.600\n&gt;&gt; That's some definitely\ninteresting stuff.\n\n767\n00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.650\nGo out there, check it out, see how\nthey work because these are the kinda\n\n768\n00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.220\nthings we're gonna be doing on\na regular basis, as the CHFI, adding\n\n769\n00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.260\nto our collection of tools, and just neat\nlittle things that we have learned and\n\n770\n00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.960\npicked up along the way that\nhelp us perform our job better.\n\n771\n00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.660\nAnd also been a very interesting overview\non working with partitioning and\n\n772\n00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.720\nthe different booting types of tables.\n\n773\n00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.670\nThat's a lot of fun to work with.\n\n774\n00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.240\nHopefully not too much that you have\nto actually do in real life because it\n\n775\n00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.520\ncan be a bit of a teeth grinder.\n\n776\n00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.860\n[LAUGH] That being said it still is\nsomething we do need to know about.\n\n777\n00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.530\nAll right, Adam.\nLooking at our clock we are out of time\n\n778\n00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.460\nfor this episode, so\nwe're going to have to\n\n779\n00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.640\ncontinue on with another part in this\nlittle miniseries we got going on.\n\n780\n00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.500\nThank you for joining us today, and\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n781\n00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.230\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n782\n00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.940\n&gt;&gt;

--> 00:00:36.657\nI could do it any way.\n\n14\n00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:37.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.480\n&gt;&gt; So anyway, it is going well,\n\n16\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.110\nit is going well.\n\n17\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.620\nHopefully you got the counter culture\nreference there, for Star Trek original\n\n18\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.805\nbut if you didn't well then, you do need\nto go out and watch a little movie and TV.\n\n19\n00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.290\nSo, the idea that we're\ngonna jump into here,\n\n20\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.370\nkind of a continuation\nof our last episode.\n\n21\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.430\nIf you haven't seen it,\ngood, go back, take a look.\n\n22\n00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.240\nWe started to talk about the boot process.\n\n23\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.220\nTalked a little bit about the GPT, NBR,\nUEFI, and how we substitute out for\n\n24\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.720\nthe NBR, if we're gonna use the GUID\npartition table for booting.\n\n25\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.590\nAnd then the Windows boot process,\nwent through that,\n\n26\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.880\ntold you we'd look at the macOS and\nthe Linux boot process.\n\n27\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.930\nWe're gonna jump right back in and\ndo that now, so if you wanna join me here,\n\n28\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.720\nwe'll throw up the Mac boot process.\n\n29\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.570\nAnd we could go full screen just to see\nthat because I'm sitting over the top\n\n30\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.070\nof part of that.\n\n31\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.020\nI gotta find a way to shrink myself\ndown and become just a little pixel so\n\n32\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.040\nI could still talk\n&gt;&gt; Like a floating head.\n\n33\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.190\n&gt;&gt; I could be, that would be great, right?\n\n34\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.770\nSo, when we have and just so you could\nsee, and I'll just tick up one there.\n\n35\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.527\nSorry, I put the words at the top,\nbut I rolled passed it,\n\n36\n00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:37.120\nbut the Macintosh Boot Process, just so\nyou know what we're talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.565\nWe've got, well roughly the same process,\nsame thought process.\n\n38\n00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:44.065\nSame number of steps here,\nbroken down into 13 steps for\n\n39\n00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.465\nyou that we did have with Windows.\n\n40\n00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:47.455\nSo again, not a magic number.\n\n41\n00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:50.985\nCould we contract some of these steps and\nkinda bulk them together?\n\n42\n00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.970\nCould we extend it,\nbreak it down even more?\n\n43\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.590\nYeah.\nThis is just an approximation of\n\n44\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.150\nwhat happens.\n\n45\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.480\nBut the idea is we'd latch onto\ncertain key things that go on, look at\n\n46\n00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.920\nthe similarities, look at the differences,\nand be aware of what's happening.\n\n47\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.070\nWe do start with\nthe activation of the bootrom,\n\n48\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.240\nwhich initializes hardware,\nselects the OS to run.\n\n49\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.040\nWe then, once we are powering on,\n\n50\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.340\nthe bootrom performs the power on self\ntest again, the post is a standard concept\n\n51\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.430\nnot limited to, not link to an individual\noperating system implementation.\n\n52\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.840\nThis is how we test the hardware.\n\n53\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.594\nIt's a BIOS thing.\n\n54\n00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:21.680\nSo, it's gonna happen\nregardless of what we're doing,\n\n55\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.630\nwhether it's UEFI,\nwhether it's BIOS whatever it is.\n\n56\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.035\nWe always have a post first,\n\n57\n00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:29.020\nbecause we have to initialize the hardware\nbefore we load anything and do anything.\n\n58\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.702\nRight?\nSo that's always gonna be there.\n\n59\n00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:33.990\nPowerPC-Based Macs,\nthe open firmware initializes\n\n60\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.610\nthe rest of the hardware interfaces\non a non-power PC based.\n\n61\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.380\nIntel based,\n\n62\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.790\nyou have EFF, EFI excuse me, initializing\nthe rest of the hardware interface.\n\n63\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.160\nSo it depends on the kind of\narchitecture that we're looking at.\n\n64\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.420\nAnd then after we initialize the hardware\ninterfaces, the system selects the OS.\n\n65\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.760\nThe system will then, if we have\nmultiple OSs, allow us to choose.\n\n66\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.050\nSo we get a boot menu, right,\nin terms of what we're gonna choose.\n\n67\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.446\nWe can do that, we then pass control\nover to the BootX in Power PC or\n\n68\n00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:06.000\nboot EFI in Intel, for boot loaders.\n\n69\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.190\nAnd then from there, we will go ahead and\nhave our kernel or a pre-linked\n\n70\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.780\nversion of the kernel, and then give you\nthe path of these things located there.\n\n71\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.200\nAnd then if we miss that for any reason,\nif the pre-linked kernel is missing,\n\n72\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.520\nthe bootloader attempts to\nload the mkext cache file.\n\n73\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.962\nRight?\nThe make ext, I guess.\n\n74\n00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or make ex, yeah, make ext cache file,\n\n75\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.850\nwhich has a set of device drivers\nthat will then allow us to access and\n\n76\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.430\ntry to find hardware.\n\n77\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.510\nIf the cache file is also missing,\nwe search for\n\n78\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.040\ndrivers in the system\nlibrary extensions directory.\n\n79\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.800\nSo a couple of different places\nwe go to look for stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.580\nOnce the drivers are loaded,\nso we can attach to and\n\n81\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.312\ninteract with the rest of system.\n\n82\n00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.940\nBootloader starts initialization\nof the kernel, the Mac H and\n\n83\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.939\nBST data structures as well as the IO kit,\nare then available.\n\n84\n00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.350\nThe IO kit uses the device tree, loads\nour drivers to the kernel or loads and\n\n85\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.700\nmakes them available, links them,\nI should say loads them in for the kernel,\n\n86\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.083\nand then launch daemon.\n\n87\n00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:05.610\nThe launch daemon,\n\n88\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.300\nwhich replaces the Mac init process in\nnewer versions, runs startup items, and\n\n89\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.070\nthen from there, we prepare the system,\nlast little step there.\n\n90\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.810\nPrepare the system for the user,\nin other words, that essentially gives us\n\n91\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.620\nour graphical interface and eventually\nlets you get on to your desktop.\n\n92\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.420\nSo, little bit of\na different thought process,\n\n93\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.110\nmuch more Linux/UNIX like, much more\nsimilar to what we'd be used to there,\n\n94\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.940\nthan what the Windows\nboot process looked like.\n\n95\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.723\nWe're gonna see some references to\nthings that are probably not gonna be\n\n96\n00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:33.290\nfamiliar to us if we're doing this\nfrom the Windows perspective.\n\n97\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.988\nBut again as an investigator,\nwanna keep in mind,\n\n98\n00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:40.189\nthat we don't often deal with the boot\nprocess, but we do have to be aware of it,\n\n99\n00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.330\nand have knowledge of it, because we may\nhave to go in and investigate why files\n\n100\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.842\naren't up there, have files been modified,\nhas something strange been going on.\n\n101\n00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:51.490\nBut, generally,\nonce we capture forensically sound\n\n102\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.330\ncopy of the hard drive or the image,\nwe're going to work off that.\n\n103\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.100\nWe're probably, as I said, not gonna\ngo back and touch the original and\n\n104\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.670\nboot it back up again, because we don't\nwant to risk modifying the system data.\n\n105\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.830\nAnd so, we're not gonna be dealing with\nthat unless we have some very specific\n\n106\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.970\ncircumstances that we may\nbe needing to address.\n\n107\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.790\nSo just wanna be aware of that.\n\n108\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.260\nThe Linux boot process, you could\nsee it on the screen here, as well.\n\n109\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.825\nYou will see we have three stages,\ntraditionally, that we think of.\n\n110\n00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:16.491\nThey're the BIOS stage,\nthe bootloader stage, the kernel stage,\n\n111\n00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:21.250\nmay just wanna do this,\njust to make them a little bit easier just\n\n112\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.200\nto make it easier for us to see them, and\njust make it to stand out a little bit.\n\n113\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.900\nThe BIOS stage initializes system\nhardware during the booting process.\n\n114\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.080\nThen we go in, and\nwe go to the bootloader stage,\n\n115\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.850\nit's where we load the Linux kernel\nto RAM disk, if we're using one.\n\n116\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.960\nWe may or may not be using a RAM disk and\n\n117\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.225\nthen the kernel stage virtual root file\nsystems created by the innate RD image,\n\n118\n00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:45.341\nand that executes the actual\nLinux RC program, which,\n\n119\n00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:47.440\nthen ultimately, takes control and\ndoes all the stuff we need to do.\n\n120\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.750\nAnd ultimately loads and\n\n121\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.640\ninitializes all the system daemons,\nthe files, all the stuff that we may need.\n\n122\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.610\nSo the Linux process, a little bit\nmore streamlined, not as many steps.\n\n123\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.660\nBut that's just because we have a lot\nof stuff going on in each phase,\n\n124\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.140\nif you will, or each part of the process.\n\n125\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.650\nKernel stage, in particular,\nis where we're searching for\n\n126\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.870\nnew hardware,\nloading all the suitable device drivers.\n\n127\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.070\nWe're mounting the actual\nroot file system.\n\n128\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.500\nWe're passing it in and\nperforming the init process, ultimately\n\n129\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.760\nthat reads whatever's in init and\nultimately initializes the system daemons.\n\n130\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.080\nAll that stuff happened in the kernel\nstage, is really like steps 4 through 13,\n\n131\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.050\ntraditionally, right,\nin most of the other booth processes.\n\n132\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.520\nIt's just group together there\nlogically in that particular stage.\n\n133\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.220\nSo we do see the same thought process,\njust broken out and accounted for\n\n134\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.205\na little bit differently.\n\n135\n00:06:31.205 --> 00:06:32.585\nBut, again we wanna be\nthinking about that.\n\n136\n00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.179\nJust have knowledge of that,\nand be aware of the fact that,\n\n137\n00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:40.215\nwhile operating systems do roughly\nfollow the same kind of trajectory,\n\n138\n00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:42.805\nwe may refer the stages in different ways.\n\n139\n00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:46.265\nHave a different numbering sequence for\nthem, or different set of steps for\n\n140\n00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:46.815\nthem, but\n\n141\n00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:50.440\nthe general thought processes are probably\ngonna align, and be somewhat similar.\n\n142\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.245\nHave you really ever had to deal with the,\nI mean maybe troubleshooting, I could see.\n\n143\n00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; In support work you would deal with\n\n144\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.780\nthe bootloader process,\nif something's not going on.\n\n145\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.000\nBut, in just general, every day usage,\nunless something goes horribly wrong,\n\n146\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.050\nyou wouldn't want to think about it.\n\n147\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you definitely mess with\nsome of the stuff that's in the init,\n\n148\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.510\nespecially if you're using SysV init.\n\n149\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Well make some changes,\nthings of that nature.\n\n150\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.980\n&gt;&gt; All that old monolithic, right?\n\n151\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.480\nAnd then you have System D and\nUpstart still running around,\n\n152\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.120\nthey're trying to make changes to that.\n\n153\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.410\nBut basically,\nit's a pretty straight forward process.\n\n154\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.780\nYou have a set of folders that says, here\nare the scripts that I would like you to\n\n155\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.600\nrun, and if something's not running,\nyou go in there and you find out why.\n\n156\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.120\nYou look at the scripts,\nsee if there's something changed.\n\n157\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Well your conf files or\nwhatever it would be,\n\n158\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.440\nall the different ones, super simple.\n\n159\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I like about Linux.\n\n160\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.180\nThey do make it kinda simple.\n\n161\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.111\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\nIn that respect, it is.\n\n162\n00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:32.503\nPeople are often, and\nwe've had this conversation.\n\n163\n00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:33.111\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:35.794\n&gt;&gt; But from the Windows world\nwe tend to fear, right?\n\n165\n00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:37.388\nLike fear the prompt.\n\n166\n00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:41.267\nSo, it sometimes can be a little scary to\nenvision or potentially think through,\n\n167\n00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:43.023\nthe logic of hey let me go use that OS.\n\n168\n00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:44.544\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That I may have heard about for\n\n169\n00:07:44.544 --> 00:07:46.250\na long time, as more complex.\n\n170\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.392\nIt may not be the easiest to use,\nbut the reality is,\n\n171\n00:07:48.392 --> 00:07:50.211\nit's actually a fairly straight forward.\n\n172\n00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:51.180\n&gt;&gt; Straight forward, yeah.\n\n173\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.952\nIt's actually not that hard.\n\n174\n00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:57.510\nIt's just that there's this fear you\nhave to overcome around navigating.\n\n175\n00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.016\n&gt;&gt; It's so foreign to most people.\n\n176\n00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.560\n&gt;&gt; That's fair to say.\n\n177\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.502\nThat's is true.\n\n178\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:02.782\nSo types of file systems.\n\n179\n00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.547\nWe've been talking about Boot processor or\nboot loaders, and\n\n180\n00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:08.062\nI'll search different ways\nwe get stuff up and running.\n\n181\n00:08:08.062 --> 00:08:09.860\nWhat about the types of file systems?\n\n182\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.640\nI have a whole different\nbunch that we could think of.\n\n183\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.390\nWe have shared disk file systems,\nspecial purpose for\n\n184\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.040\na variety of individual things.\n\n185\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.900\nTapes, flash, database,\n\n186\n00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.060\nnetwork disk, all sorts of\ndifferent file systems that exist.\n\n187\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.670\nBut we often think about the Windows\nfile system, for instance, right?\n\n188\n00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.120\nAnd think about things like FAT and\n\n189\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.840\nNTFS as we talked about already,\nas being there.\n\n190\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.620\nThe EXT file systems in Linux and UNIX,\nHFS, HFS+ in a Macintosh solution.\n\n191\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.660\nSo wanna be thinking about that.\n\n192\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.440\nIn fact, restoring all the files,\nand really thinking about\n\n193\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.935\nall the thought process there from you and\nold perspective, right?\n\n194\n00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:46.390\nYeah, were looking at an older file\nsystem may not be use much anymore.\n\n195\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.628\nRemember, we talked about FAT12,\nFAT16, FAT32,\n\n196\n00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.904\ndue to the differences in those systems.\n\n197\n00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:55.137\nWe would traditionally have really just\nthought of FAT32 as being the FAT file\n\n198\n00:08:55.137 --> 00:08:57.463\nsystem that we would've used\nin most modern computers.\n\n199\n00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.365\nI mentioned FAT12 would've been\nused primarily for floppy drives,\n\n200\n00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.550\nand early sort of floppy disks,\nwe don't even really see that anymore.\n\n201\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.824\nBut we just wanna keep that file process\nin mind, and know that while it's there,\n\n202\n00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:07.488\nwe could see it,\n\n203\n00:09:07.488 --> 00:09:10.393\nwe really don't use it because of\nthe limitations of space management.\n\n204\n00:09:10.393 --> 00:09:14.779\nThe ability to really not partition out\nlarge hard drives things like that, so\n\n205\n00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.270\nI just wanna be aware\nof the concepts of FAT.\n\n206\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.110\nWe then have NTFS probably the more\ntraditional file system that we see\n\n207\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.398\nmost often in Windows today\nthat would really be that.\n\n208\n00:09:23.398 --> 00:09:27.290\nAlthough we do have the newer file system\nthe RAFS in newer versions of Windows,\n\n209\n00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.520\na resilient file system.\n\n210\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.330\nEven newer in 16 for\ninstance, right, Server 16.\n\n211\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.775\nBut we do have new features in NTFS\ncompared to FAT that we would have seen,\n\n212\n00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:40.957\nwe have sparse file support, disk usage\nquotas were added in NTFS, reparse points.\n\n213\n00:09:40.957 --> 00:09:45.182\nWe have the use of EFS, the Encrypting\nFile System, additional sub file system\n\n214\n00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:49.469\nwill let us encrypt, or use encryption on\nthe disk, we then have BitLocker whole\n\n215\n00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:52.718\ndisk, whole instance encryption\nthat comes around later.\n\n216\n00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:54.560\nSo I just wanna be thinking about that.\n\n217\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.431\nWe do all the list a system files and\nNTFS that are important for us,\n\n218\n00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:00.456\nif you just give me one second,\nI'll be happy to throw those up here and\n\n219\n00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:01.603\nto show you what they are.\n\n220\n00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:04.347\nIf you wanna just go ahead and\nthrow then up, I can take a quick look,\n\n221\n00:10:04.347 --> 00:10:06.300\nwe have them right there.\n\n222\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.280\nThey have the dollar signs in front of\nthem, we have two, four, six, eight,\n\n223\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.853\nabout ten of them that I listed here.\n\n224\n00:10:10.853 --> 00:10:16.186\n$attrdef, the $badclus, $bitmap,\n$boot, $logfile, $mft, $mftmirr,\n\n225\n00:10:16.186 --> 00:10:21.310\nthe mirror of $mft for recovery, The\nquota, the upcase and the volume, right?\n\n226\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.050\nThese are the traditional system files\nthat NTFS is a file system we'll mount.\n\n227\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.857\nSo, you could see a little description\nof what each one is there.\n\n228\n00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:31.960\nWe would wanna just be aware of\nthese as a forensic investigator.\n\n229\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.467\nAgain we may go after, we wanna capture\nthis, we would as part of a disk image,\n\n230\n00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.859\nbut we wanna make sure we have this,\nespecially MFT,\n\n231\n00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:39.310\nthe Master File Table, right?\n\n232\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.680\nBecause, it's gotta have a reference\nto all the files that are there.\n\n233\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.190\nThe volume bootstrap, the boot sector or\nthe boot system file, for instance,\n\n234\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.550\nwould be valuable.\n\n235\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.770\nThe bitmap for the entire volume,\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n236\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.180\nAll bad clusters listed in\nthe $badclus file, wanna know that.\n\n237\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.940\nBecause again, that gives us\nthe architecture of the roadmap around\n\n238\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.200\nthe hard drive, and allows us to\nunderstand what should be there.\n\n239\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.820\nAnd as a result, would then allow\nus to go back and validate that,\n\n240\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.710\nand interact with it, may be somebody\nis attached to the slack space, or\n\n241\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.510\nwe have bad sectors that had\nbeen rewritten or modified.\n\n242\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.625\nThese things will become\napparent if we start to look,\n\n243\n00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:16.485\nwe'd wanna look at the bad cluster listed,\nsee all the bad clusters.\n\n244\n00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.552\nCross-reference that with a disk\npartition editor, and see whether or\n\n245\n00:11:19.552 --> 00:11:21.720\nnot they are actually indeed bad,\nand if so, why?\n\n246\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.480\nAnd if not, hey,\nwhy were they marked that way?\n\n247\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.130\nMaybe there is information hiding in\nthere, we have to be aware of that.\n\n248\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.350\nSo acknowledge of these files and knowing\nthat they're there, would actually be\n\n249\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.025\nreally helpful and important for\nus, just wanna keep that in mind.\n\n250\n00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.191\nWhen we do set up the NTFS boot sector,\n\n251\n00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.561\nthe program is gonna\nset up as we format and\n\n252\n00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:42.556\nassign the first 16 sectors to the boot\nsector, what's called the bootstrap code.\n\n253\n00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:45.560\nSo we take a portion of the initial\npart of the hard drive out for that,\n\n254\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.480\nand then we have a partition\nidentifier that is gonna\n\n255\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.300\nbe set up as a string uniquely\nidentifying, as we said.\n\n256\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.258\nIn the MBR, it will be 0x07,\nif you wanna take a look right here,\n\n257\n00:11:55.258 --> 00:11:57.350\nto show that to you really quickly.\n\n258\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.243\nYou could see it right here, in the hex,\n\n259\n00:11:59.243 --> 00:12:01.369\nthat would be the MBR\npartition identifier.\n\n260\n00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:04.475\nThis is gonna be the GPT identifier.\n\n261\n00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.620\nOops, right there, so\nyou could see the difference between them.\n\n262\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.420\nMay be important to know that for\nthe exam, in a sense that you never know.\n\n263\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.370\nHey, 0x07, what is that?\n\n264\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.082\nWell that's the partition identifier for\nthe NTFS boot sector with an MBR,\n\n265\n00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:18.720\nyou probably wanna know that.\n\n266\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.900\nSo, the reason we're listing it there for\nyou, is to be aware of that.\n\n267\n00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.000\nObviously forensically,\nas we're investigating a drive,\n\n268\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.490\nif we were to see that, we should be able\nto pick up on the fact in the hex editor\n\n269\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.130\nas we look at the drive, or the drive\neditor, whatever we're looking at it with.\n\n270\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.063\nThat if we see that, at the very beginning\nof the partition identifier in the first\n\n271\n00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:36.291\nfew sectors, we'd wanna know immediately.\n\n272\n00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:39.973\nAlthough we would have other techniques,\nand obviously other tools that we've\n\n273\n00:12:39.973 --> 00:12:42.744\ntalked about to establish whether\nit's an MBR or a GPT disk.\n\n274\n00:12:42.744 --> 00:12:44.973\nBut assuming we saw this\nforced on anything else,\n\n275\n00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.708\nthat should be an indicator for us, a\nvisual reference, that we're seeing this.\n\n276\n00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:50.800\nI just wanna make sure we're\naware of that and we know that.\n\n277\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.000\nShow you the cluster sizes.\n\n278\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.761\nI just had them up, if could you\nthrow them back for just a second.\n\n279\n00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:58.270\nSorry about that, i should have said, we\nwanted to stay on that for just a moment.\n\n280\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.260\nBut the cluster sizes are there for\nthe NTFS volume.\n\n281\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.961\nYou could see,\nwe used variable cluster size,\n\n282\n00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:05.355\ndepending on the overall volume size,\n512 megabytes or less.\n\n283\n00:13:05.355 --> 00:13:07.622\nWho creates a 512 mega or\nless volume today?\n\n284\n00:13:07.622 --> 00:13:11.510\nI mean, I can see if you were\ndoing something like VMware,\n\n285\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.720\nand installing ESXi, but\nthat's not Microsoft, not NTFS.\n\n286\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720\nWhere's the reason for that?\n\n287\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.700\nJust doesn't make sense.\n\n288\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.693\n&gt;&gt; Just a hold out from a day gone by.\n\n289\n00:13:18.693 --> 00:13:21.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah, it is.\n\n290\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.480\nWhen LSs where much smaller, obviously,\nin theory you could do that.\n\n291\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.510\nBut to have a 512 byte cluster,\nremember 512 bytes,\n\n292\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.542\nsmallest allocation size,\nwhich you traditionally see,\n\n293\n00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:34.807\nif you go from 513 megs above 512 and\nother 7 to 8 gig, you get a 1K cluster.\n\n294\n00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:39.212\n1 gig to 2 gigs, 2K, and\nlarger than 2 gig, you get a 4K cluster,\n\n295\n00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:40.498\nas we talked about.\n\n296\n00:13:40.498 --> 00:13:44.060\nSo I just wanna make sure you're aware of\nthat, and know that, that is going on.\n\n297\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.026\nWe talked about the master file table,\nand the fact that we do have the MTF.\n\n298\n00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:50.881\nIt's one of the files that we have right\nup here, just to remind us of that,\n\n299\n00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:53.405\nthe record of all of\nthe files that are existing.\n\n300\n00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:56.353\nSo the NTFS master file table\nas you could see there,\n\n301\n00:13:56.353 --> 00:14:00.450\nconsists of information relating\nthe files, and the file attributes.\n\n302\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.690\nI'm kinda over part of that,\n\n303\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.400\nmaybe we can go to full screen for a just\na second, just so we could see that.\n\n304\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.178\nThank you very much.\n\n305\n00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.770\nSo you could see we relate that to\nthe files, and file attributes.\n\n306\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.850\nIt's set up like,\nliterally it's a relational database, so\n\n307\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.120\nthere's tables and rows.\n\n308\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.070\nAnd so, it would be helpful for you to\nknow what the rows are gonna be doing.\n\n309\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.708\nAnd to make sure that we understand that\nthe rows consist a file records, and\n\n310\n00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:23.310\nthe columns are gonna consist\nof file attributes, right?\n\n311\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.187\nAnd we have information on everything\nof that is in there, and so\n\n312\n00:14:26.187 --> 00:14:28.549\nwe just wanted to know that\nwould be valuable for us.\n\n313\n00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:30.244\nIf we may wanna go after that data, or\n\n314\n00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:34.530\nthat information to validate what's on the\ndrive, and to understand how it's set up.\n\n315\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.770\nSo, just important for us.\n\n316\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.200\nSo we're gonna stay on the notes here for\njust a minute.\n\n317\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.820\nWanna do a quick demonstration for\nyou on something called ADFS.\n\n318\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.950\nDon't know if you're familiar with\nalternate data streams or not, you may or\n\n319\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.510\nmay not have been educated on this.\n\n320\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.070\nBut, if you've heard of ADFS,\nand I need a command prompt with\n\n321\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.870\na administrative right, so\ngive me just one second.\n\n322\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.990\nI'm just gonna open up the command\nprompt here with admin rights,\n\n323\n00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.350\nand do that while we are talking.\n\n324\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.443\nBut Daniel, have you heard of ADFS?\n\n325\n00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:05.115\nThis is actually something that\ncomes to us from your world,\n\n326\n00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:09.190\npotentially anyway, can be linked\nback to file systems like HFS.\n\n327\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.350\n&gt;&gt; I did not know that.\n\n328\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, actually.\n\n329\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.560\nSo, we've had the capability in NTFS for\n\n330\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.720\nsome time to use what's called ATFS\naltered data streams, ADS, excuse me.\n\n331\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.760\nI'm saying ADFS.\n\n332\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:21.312\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not ADFS,\n\n334\n00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:23.001\nADS, Alternate Data Streams.\n\n335\n00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.390\nSo we're gonna take a look,\nthis kind of a cool thing.\n\n336\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.290\nSo, if I for instance, right,\n\n337\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.090\nwere to do something like this,\ngo in and type notepad here.\n\n338\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:38.859\nAnd then what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna\ncall this, let's call this sample.txt,\n\n339\n00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:44.070\nand let's pen to it\nfile called secret.txt.\n\n340\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.520\nAnd so what I'm doing here,\nI'm gonna use Notepad, notepad.exe.\n\n341\n00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.420\nWe're just implying the .exe,\nthe executable here.\n\n342\n00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.250\nBut we don't have to put in,\n\n343\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.370\none of the nice things about\nthe command prompt in Windows.\n\n344\n00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.123\nWe try everything and see if\neverything is executable, and if it is,\n\n345\n00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:58.410\nwe know it's implied, and\nwe don't have to specify it.\n\n346\n00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.952\nSo call the Notepad program,\ngive it a file name that we wanna create,\n\n347\n00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:02.750\nsample.txt.\n\n348\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.938\nBut we don't normally name our files\nSomething colon something else, that's-\n\n349\n00:16:05.938 --> 00:16:06.850\n&gt;&gt; Not usual.\n\n350\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.829\n&gt;&gt; Not usual.\n\n351\n00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:09.100\nSo what happens when we do this?\n\n352\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.840\nWell, Notepad opens up and,\nas you can see right there,\n\n353\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.270\ncannot find sampletext:secrettext.file,\ndo you want to create this?\n\n354\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.660\nWell, sure let's create that.\n\n355\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.170\nAll right, so sampletextsecrettext.txt.\n\n356\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.638\nSo, let's do the following.\n\n357\n00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:29.310\nHello world, and just go ahead and save\nthat off, and we agree that that's there.\n\n358\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.590\nLet's close that.\n\n359\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.090\nNow, instead of doing this from the\ncommand line only because, well I could\n\n360\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.130\ndo it from the command line, let's\njust do notepad, let's just do sample.\n\n361\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.850\nI was just gonna go browse.\n\n362\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.910\nI'll show you this in a minute,\nI'll go into the graphical interface.\n\n363\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.340\nBut let's do notepad sample.txt.\n\n364\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.060\nWe open up sample.txt,\nwhich we did create, right?\n\n365\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.050\nIf you remember,\nwe created sample.txt:secret.txt.\n\n366\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.830\nWe create two files.\n\n367\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.508\nThis is what the author and\ndata stream is.\n\n368\n00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:56.950\nSample.txt gets created;\nhas no data in it.\n\n369\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.680\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n370\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.497\n&gt;&gt; You can see nothing there.\n\n371\n00:16:58.497 --> 00:16:59.760\n&gt;&gt; But we typed, Hello world.\n\n372\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.360\n&gt;&gt; We did, and\nwe type it into sample.txt:secret.txt.\n\n373\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:11.484\nAnd so, if we want to--- Go back and bring\nthat up, we don't get prompted this time,\n\n374\n00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:14.050\nbecause we created the file already,\nwe now have two files.\n\n375\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.810\nNow, essentially what we did is, we have\ntwo file, but this is the interesting\n\n376\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.458\npart, this is why I want to go to the\ngraphical interface for you, because if I\n\n377\n00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:25.526\ngo to parse all the files in System32 in\nthe command line, we're gonna go right by.\n\n378\n00:17:25.526 --> 00:17:28.385\nWe're never even gonna see it, so\ngive me just a second to just go in and\n\n379\n00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:29.510\nopen up Windows Explorer.\n\n380\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.170\nSo we can do that, but when we do that,\nwhat we're gonna find,\n\n381\n00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.270\nwe'll just go into C here.\n\n382\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:40.289\nAnd go into System32,\nso, let me go in here,\n\n383\n00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:45.450\nand go in there, and\ngo in right down here.\n\n384\n00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.330\nWhat am I looking for, there we are, okay.\n\n385\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:54.120\nAnd so if we go in, down here,\nand just scroll all the way down,\n\n386\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.520\np, q, r, oops, went a little too far,\nscroll back up there, and\n\n387\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.890\nlet's get right up there, r, s,\nthere we are right there, okay.\n\n388\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.990\nSo what we could see,\ngo full screen for me to see so\n\n389\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.520\nwe could see because it's\nprobably hard to see.\n\n390\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.010\nSo you could see there sample.txt exists,\n0 kilobytes in size, right?\n\n391\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.100\nWe created a sample.txt file\nbecause that's what notepad does.\n\n392\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.810\nThat's the container, right?\n\n393\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.070\nNow there's nothing,\nI think I just highlighted that,\n\n394\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.190\nthere's nothing in that we saw\nbecause we did parse sample.txt.\n\n395\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.850\nI have it right here, right, it is empty.\n\n396\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.520\nWe can see it and I'll just kind\nof bring that up, and do that so\n\n397\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.880\nyou can see that they're the same,\nand they are empty, zero kilobytes.\n\n398\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.440\nWhat we don't see, is sample.txt colon\nof whatever the other one was, right,\n\n399\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.228\nwhatever I said.\n\n400\n00:18:40.228 --> 00:18:45.170\nAnd sample.txt:secret.txt, right.\n\n401\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.250\nWe do have a file because\nyou saw it can pull it up,\n\n402\n00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.350\nI can load it by using the command line.\n\n403\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.730\nBut we don't see it in\nthe graphical editor.\n\n404\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Is it showing like a hidden file or\nsomething?\n\n405\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.750\n&gt;&gt; This is the ADS,\nthis is the alternate data stream.\n\n406\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.450\nAnd so, the hidden file is\nthe secret.txt file that's appended at\n\n407\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.680\nthe end of the sample.txt line,\nwhen we create it.\n\n408\n00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.990\nAnd we're manipulating the NTFS\nfile system by doing this.\n\n409\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.733\nAnd as a result, this well known\nattribute that's been around forever,\n\n410\n00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.350\nit's not secret, you can read up on ADSs.\n\n411\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.721\nWe actually have URL on\nthe show notes to tell how to\n\n412\n00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.570\nread up on this at ForensicsFocus.com.\n\n413\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.660\nYou can go and\ntake a look just to understand it.\n\n414\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.360\nBut this has been around forever,\n\n415\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.420\nand this is just a common idea\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n416\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.730\nBut as a forensics investigator,\n\n417\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.440\nwe have to know that any file in\nan NTFS system could potentially have\n\n418\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.000\nan alternate data stream, hidden data\nappended to it that we don't see.\n\n419\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.190\nNow this is one of the ways that\nmalware gets propagated into systems,\n\n420\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.810\nbecause we can append the malware to\nthe file and we don't know it's there,\n\n421\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.350\nwe load and execute.\n\n422\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.210\nYou know,\nwe're using this benignly as a text file.\n\n423\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:52.210\nImagine instead, we load it in executable\nas the hidden data, we load the text file,\n\n424\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.960\nthe executable runs behind\nthe scenes without our knowledge and\n\n425\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.110\ninfects the system.\n\n426\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.920\nSo this can get to be very nasty,\nvery quickly, but\n\n427\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.830\nyou have to understand the logic of this.\n\n428\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.790\nAs an investigator, you have to go in and\nfind ADSs and evidence of them.\n\n429\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:06.730\nThere are several tools.\n\n430\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.026\nThere's a tool called\nLADS.exe that you can use.\n\n431\n00:20:10.026 --> 00:20:13.470\nThere's a company called Stream Armor,\nyou go out to their website,\n\n432\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.930\nhas a really good ADS tool that you\ncan use as well to find ADS streams.\n\n433\n00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:23.630\nSo you can detect it\nat securityxploded.com\n\n434\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.900\nis the name of the website and\nStream Armor is the actual information or\n\n435\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.690\nthe item you're going to\nwant to take a look at.\n\n436\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.600\nBut these tools will find alternate\ndata streams just by being run\n\n437\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.880\nagainst a ADS-capable partition,\nany NTFS partition, or rather,\n\n438\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.830\nany NTFS formatted file system will find\nthat or potentially have that available.\n\n439\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.870\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, is there no way way other\nthan using those specific types of tools?\n\n440\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.839\nTo discover these, like built in and\nthen printing system.\n\n441\n00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:49.727\nNo, not built in,\n\n442\n00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:52.900\nnot through the GUI because we\ndon't see them in Windows Explorer.\n\n443\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.960\nThere's no way to expose them\neven though they're an attribute,\n\n444\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.820\nthey're hidden, you would never see\nthem unless you knew the exact path and\n\n445\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.935\nthe name as you saw for\nme to call the file.\n\n446\n00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:04.450\nCuz I was able to bring the file up,\nI just had to know what the path was.\n\n447\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.174\nI knew it was sample.txt:secret.txt and\nboom,\n\n448\n00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:11.353\nthe file shows up Hello world it's there,\nbut I don't see a reference to it and\n\n449\n00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.480\nthere is no way to expose unless\nI use a toll that does this.\n\n450\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.443\nNow, the Sys internals tool set from\nMark Russinovich who is now part of\n\n451\n00:21:19.443 --> 00:21:24.660\nMicrosoft Windows so the Winternals\ntools that are now gonna be there.\n\n452\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.260\nBut his former company, right Sysinternals\nand the Windows port of it now,\n\n453\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.700\nhe also has a tool that does this,\nand will find it.\n\n454\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.060\nSo you could certainly go out and\nget those from there.\n\n455\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.481\nJust go to TechNet,\nmicrosoft.com/technet or\n\n456\n00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:40.080\ntechnet.microsoft.com, whatever it is,\nand you could find them there.\n\n457\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.530\nBut you would be able to see and use tools\nto read the attribute map and find them.\n\n458\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.630\nBut the attributes are hidden and\n\n459\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.910\nwe don't expose them normally by\ndefault inside of the interface.\n\n460\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.050\nAnd that is one of those little\ninteresting things but pesky things that,\n\n461\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.820\nif we're not familiar with, actually\ncan cause us some consternation and\n\n462\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.470\nsome concern that we just have\nto really know how to address.\n\n463\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.820\nAgain, knowing that they're there, as\na forensic investigator, not a big deal,\n\n464\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.680\nbut you have to be knowledgeable enough\nwithout them to know how to pick them up\n\n465\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.920\nand find evidence of them.\n\n466\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.830\nWe can find and hide a lot of\ndata in alternate data streams,\n\n467\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.240\nbecause they won't be exposed or\nwill not show up.\n\n468\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.990\nYou do have to be aware of that.\n\n469\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.410\nWe tend to see one tell-tale sign.\n\n470\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.327\nWe tend to see weird things going\non with the drive, sizes and\n\n471\n00:22:23.327 --> 00:22:24.477\nthe geometry to drive.\n\n472\n00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:27.345\nWhere the drive map doesn't appear\nto add up to what we see and\n\n473\n00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:30.940\nwe're missing data even though it\nlooks like there's nothing there.\n\n474\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.458\nWe seem to see the data is ultimately\nbeing taken up on the driver can account\n\n475\n00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:37.620\nfor it, we may actually have evidence\nof open data scripts cuz, remember,\n\n476\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.940\nwe are storing data.\n\n477\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.510\nSo, it does have to show up\nsomewhere a system we may not see\n\n478\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.620\nthe traditional interfaces.\n\n479\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.290\nYou know, five or six characters,\nyou're not even gonna notice that.\n\n480\n00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.220\nIt's not gonna show up.\n\n481\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.672\nBut you have hundreds of megabytes of\ngigabytes stuff appended to an alternate\n\n482\n00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:52.220\ndata stream, we're going to be\nmissing that somewhere ultimately, and\n\n483\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.270\ncertain tools will tell us that, and\nas a result, we'll be able to know that.\n\n484\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.010\nSo it is important to be aware of that.\n\n485\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.680\nJust thinking ahead, right.\n\n486\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.420\nWe also have the FS in\nthe NTFS file system.\n\n487\n00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.390\nWe can use EFS to encrypt our data.\n\n488\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.400\nSo just keep in mind that we may actually\nsee data that has been encrypted\n\n489\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.770\nin the Windows environment.\n\n490\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.930\nAnd when we do that, as a recovery option,\n\n491\n00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.535\nwe obviously forensically have to go\nin unencrypt that data to read it.\n\n492\n00:23:15.535 --> 00:23:18.551\nRemember, we don't get to break the rules\ncuz we're forensic investigators.\n\n493\n00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:21.748\nData that has been encrypted can only be\nunencrypted if we have the recovery keys\n\n494\n00:23:21.748 --> 00:23:24.050\nand certificates or\nif we manage to break the encyption.\n\n495\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:29.110\nThere really are not a lot of ways\naround this, so just keep that in mind.\n\n496\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.943\nBut if EFS has been applied, we have to\nfigure out a way to unencrypt that data.\n\n497\n00:23:33.943 --> 00:23:37.827\nWe do have a data decryption field and\na data recovery field that's specified for\n\n498\n00:23:37.827 --> 00:23:38.660\nthe data.\n\n499\n00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.527\nAnd remember,\n\n500\n00:23:39.527 --> 00:23:44.072\nthe system administrator always has blank\nkind of full right behind the scenes.\n\n501\n00:23:44.072 --> 00:23:45.249\nCarte blanche as it were [LAUGH].\n\n502\n00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Ccarte blanche is what I meant to say,\nright.\n\n503\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.350\nThey have full rights as\na data recovery agent.\n\n504\n00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.794\nThey're automatically added every file and\nare given rights to recover it.\n\n505\n00:23:52.794 --> 00:23:55.018\nSo if we were able to go on\nwith the admin credential,\n\n506\n00:23:55.018 --> 00:23:57.800\nwe would then be able to recover\nall the encrypted data through EFS\n\n507\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.290\nwithout having to worry\nabout doing anything else.\n\n508\n00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.305\nSo that is just something\nto be aware of and\n\n509\n00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:04.620\nto make sure we are thinking\nabout in our minds.\n\n510\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:11.424\nJust so we know, we do have the Linux file\nsystems as well, Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4.\n\n511\n00:24:11.424 --> 00:24:13.097\nIf you wanna just join me here for\na second,\n\n512\n00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:14.966\nwe'll give you a quick\nprimer on each of those.\n\n513\n00:24:14.966 --> 00:24:16.658\nExt2 is an older file system.\n\n514\n00:24:16.658 --> 00:24:21.883\nExt3 replaced the Ext2-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can do it.\n\n515\n00:24:21.883 --> 00:24:22.789\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n516\n00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:25.179\nExt2 older file system.\n\n517\n00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:28.438\nExt3 replaces Ext2.\n\n518\n00:24:28.438 --> 00:24:31.987\nThe trick is to talk slowly and\nmethodically.\n\n519\n00:24:31.987 --> 00:24:35.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then Ext4 more recent has come out,\n\n520\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.770\ndesigned as a replacement for Ext3.\n\n521\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:43.120\nYou could see there supported by\nthis kernels 2.6.19 and onwards.\n\n522\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.800\nSo a lot of them were newer Linux\ndistributions will support Ext4.\n\n523\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.670\nYou'll see there maximum file size is 16\nTB and volume size is 1 exabyte with Ext4.\n\n524\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.982\nSo for a really high-end, obviously\ncloud-based hosting and things like that,\n\n525\n00:24:56.982 --> 00:25:00.105\nmulti-tenants environments when we need\nto allocate a large amount of data,\n\n526\n00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:01.640\nwe're going to be using a therapist.\n\n527\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.190\nJust wanna make sure we're\naware of the thought process.\n\n528\n00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:09.370\nNotice we can convert from Ext2 to Ext3,\nthe commit or\n\n529\n00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:14.050\nexcuse me the convert command I listed\nthere for you, sbin/tune2fs j and\n\n530\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.548\nthen the name of the partition\nwould do a conversion for us.\n\n531\n00:25:17.548 --> 00:25:20.150\nSo just wanna be aware of that,\njust some older and\n\n532\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.540\nnewer Linux file systems\nthat we may come across.\n\n533\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:28.090\nThe Mac OS X file system,\nas I mentioned does have HFS, HFS+ for\n\n534\n00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:33.050\nMac OS X Extended, UFX Unix file systems,\nthings like that that we would see.\n\n535\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.542\nJust wanna be aware of those as well,\nthe HFS+.\n\n536\n00:25:35.542 --> 00:25:37.280\nAre you using plus or are you using HFS?\n\n537\n00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.831\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n538\n00:25:38.831 --> 00:25:41.399\nI don't really dig into\nthe Mac operating system.\n\n539\n00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:41.936\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n540\n00:25:41.936 --> 00:25:44.122\nYou're just using some\n&gt;&gt; Just using whatever they throw at me.\n\n541\n00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:45.565\n&gt;&gt; Could be NTFS for all you know?\n\n542\n00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:46.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n543\n00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:47.457\nProbably not.\n\n544\n00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:49.237\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n545\n00:25:49.237 --> 00:25:51.374\ndepending on how new that is-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n546\n00:25:51.374 --> 00:25:54.496\n&gt;&gt; Maybe HFS+ but anyway, so just wanna\nmake sure that we're were the fact\n\n547\n00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:56.830\nthat we do a different\nversions there as well.\n\n548\n00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.982\nI'll be dividing volumes into logical\nblocks called sectors, right,\n\n549\n00:25:59.982 --> 00:26:03.403\na 512 bit sizes just like we do in all\nthe other file systems we talked about.\n\n550\n00:26:03.403 --> 00:26:07.809\nThey are cluster into allocation blocks,\nwe've heard that terminology before.\n\n551\n00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:10.076\nTotal number of allocation box\ndepend on the volume size,\n\n552\n00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:11.335\njust like we've talked about.\n\n553\n00:26:11.335 --> 00:26:14.717\nAnd we have seven types of\nsectors traditionally NHFS+,\n\n554\n00:26:14.717 --> 00:26:19.635\nyou may wanna just have a sense of these\nif you're planning on taking the exam.\n\n555\n00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:23.015\nThey're not really all that critical\notherwise, but user file fork,\n\n556\n00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:27.320\nallocation files, catalog files, extent\noverflow attribute startup in a new space.\n\n557\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.389\nA new space will obviously\nbe very critical for\n\n558\n00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:32.529\nus to look at from a forensics\ninvestigative standpoint on the drive.\n\n559\n00:26:32.529 --> 00:26:37.487\nThat's where we may find drive information\nhiding out, that address puts stuff there.\n\n560\n00:26:37.487 --> 00:26:38.897\nSo we do wanna know about these.\n\n561\n00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.417\nI'm not suggesting that they're not\nimportant, but just wanna make sure we\n\n562\n00:26:41.417 --> 00:26:44.487\nhave a sense of them, and you'll at least\nhave an idea what's going on with them.\n\n563\n00:26:44.487 --> 00:26:48.420\nBut for the exam, it would be valuable you\nmay be asked, hey out of this lift of ten\n\n564\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.870\nthings which are the ones that would\nbe traditional common sector types for\n\n565\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.120\nHFS, HFS+, and you'd wanna choose\nthese right just to make sure.\n\n566\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.930\nHave a few words to say\njust as we're wrapping up.\n\n567\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.650\nWe probably do this quickly\nabout raid storage systems.\n\n568\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.720\nAlways important to establish a sense of\nwhat goes on in the hardware as well,\n\n569\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.290\nsoftware based worlds with regards\nto storage when we are looking at\n\n570\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.762\nhaving to deal with storage\nfrom a forensic stand point.\n\n571\n00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:15.702\nAnd these are common ones by the way,\nwe have many other RAID types but 0, 1, 5,\n\n572\n00:27:15.702 --> 00:27:19.950\nand 10, RAID 0 striping with no\nparity just creating a striped set.\n\n573\n00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.261\nAnd obviously if we lose one of\nthe hard drives in the stripped set,\n\n574\n00:27:23.261 --> 00:27:25.524\nwe lose all the data\nacross the stripped set.\n\n575\n00:27:25.524 --> 00:27:29.019\nSo just be aware of that, in other\nwords no capability to recover from\n\n576\n00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:32.594\nthe drive failure with RAID 0, but\nit is a fast way of accessing data.\n\n577\n00:27:32.594 --> 00:27:36.594\nWe stripe in 64 kilobit chunks across\nthe different drives, usually at least two\n\n578\n00:27:36.594 --> 00:27:39.910\ndrives if not more, so\njust wanna be sure we are aware of that.\n\n579\n00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.790\nRAID 1 would be a drive mirror.\n\n580\n00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.950\nWe could see RAID 1 with duplexing\nwhich would be mirroring the drives and\n\n581\n00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.650\nmirroring the controllers from a fault\ntolerance and recoverability standpoint.\n\n582\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.810\nBut RAID 1 drive mirror, two drives of\nequal to approximate size set up and\n\n583\n00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.110\nformatted the same way.\n\n584\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:58.010\nData is written to both simultaneously\nthrough a common controller interface.\n\n585\n00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.940\nAnd if one drive were to fail logically or\nphysically for any reason, the other drive\n\n586\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.640\ncould be failed over to or switched over\nto whatever you have to do in the system.\n\n587\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.080\nCabling or just break in the mirror and\naccess and\n\n588\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.510\nget through the software interface and the\ndrive manager or both, whatever it is and\n\n589\n00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.258\nyou could bring the data back up,\nso it would be recoverable.\n\n590\n00:28:14.258 --> 00:28:17.460\nRaid 5 striping with parity, so\nwe have at least three drives and\n\n591\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.394\nthe minimum is maybe as many as to 32.\n\n592\n00:28:19.394 --> 00:28:22.343\nAnd we will write that across\nthe drives in the stripe but\n\n593\n00:28:22.343 --> 00:28:25.770\nwe will writing it with a parity\nblock information as well.\n\n594\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.022\nAnd the parity information is gonna\ngive us the both to recover if you lose\n\n595\n00:28:29.022 --> 00:28:29.994\nthe drive or the set.\n\n596\n00:28:29.994 --> 00:28:32.508\nWe could still access the data\nwhile we're doing that, so\n\n597\n00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:35.381\nwe could continue to operate just\nto produce capacity while we're\n\n598\n00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:38.220\nregenerating from new physical\ndrive back we generate the data.\n\n599\n00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.900\nSo we have some capabilities there,\nand RAID 10 is really just rate 1 + 0\n\n600\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.015\nsometimes know as 0 + 1,\nit's just written different ways.\n\n601\n00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.707\nBut whether you're mirroring and\nstriping or\n\n602\n00:28:46.707 --> 00:28:48.580\nstriping and mirroring,\nthe outcome is the same.\n\n603\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.800\nYou're combining rate level zero and\none together and you're getting\n\n604\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.310\nthe recoverability as well as the speed\nand functionality of those two systems.\n\n605\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.870\nSo we're kind of adding\nthe best of both if you will\n\n606\n00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.980\nin order to get access to that.\n\n607\n00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.114\nIt will be valuable for an investigator\nto understand the concept of RAID,\n\n608\n00:29:02.114 --> 00:29:05.199\nbecause again you may come up against\none or more of these stored system and\n\n609\n00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:07.312\nhave to interrogate them and\nfind data from them.\n\n610\n00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:10.320\nAnd it will be helpful for you to know\nhow they work and understand them in\n\n611\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.178\nthe mirror, you maybe able to\nliterally take the extra drive out and\n\n612\n00:29:13.178 --> 00:29:16.490\nhave a forensically sound copy already,\nprovided you are able to hash that and\n\n613\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.000\nthen create a copy from there.\n\n614\n00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.779\nYou'd already have a copy of\nall the data on the drive, but\n\n615\n00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:24.810\nwith the stripe set RAID 0, you'd have to\nactually get data across multiple drives\n\n616\n00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.353\nin order to find all the data and\nthat would be important, same as RAID 5.\n\n617\n00:29:28.353 --> 00:29:31.546\nThat will be important to know, cuz if you\ndon't mirror rather if you don't image\n\n618\n00:29:31.546 --> 00:29:34.668\nall the drives, you're not gonna get\na complete and accurate copy of the data.\n\n619\n00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:37.305\nAnd that can obviously lead to\ncomplications and concerns.\n\n620\n00:29:37.305 --> 00:29:40.175\nSo just some stuff to be aware\nof into consider as well.\n\n621\n00:29:40.175 --> 00:29:43.445\n&gt;&gt; File systems everywhere and\nthey'll all drive you to drink.\n\n622\n00:29:43.445 --> 00:29:45.470\nThat's [LAUGH].\n\n623\n00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.879\nSay they can, because there's a lot\nof attributes based on whethert using\n\n624\n00:29:48.879 --> 00:29:50.837\nWindows, Linux or Mac operating system.\n\n625\n00:29:50.837 --> 00:29:55.091\nThey all have their own little quirks and\ndo that you have to figure out-\n\n626\n00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.956\n&gt;&gt; A lot of subtlety.\n\n627\n00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:57.073\n&gt;&gt; A lots of going on there.\n\n628\n00:29:57.073 --> 00:30:01.136\nSo make sure you walk to that list\na little bit and have a good familiar and\n\n629\n00:30:01.136 --> 00:30:05.510\ngo, yes, that's part of a Windows\nfiles system for NTFS, or FAT.\n\n630\n00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.690\nI'm looking at this is\ndefinitely a Linux system,\n\n631\n00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.140\nbecause of the Ext3, I know that the stack\ngoes there, or the HFS because I'm in Mac.\n\n632\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.277\nSo just be familiarize yourself\nwith each one of these systems,\n\n633\n00:30:15.277 --> 00:30:17.904\nsearch your answer to those\nquestions accordingly.\n\n634\n00:30:17.904 --> 00:30:18.852\nAdam, thanks for helping us so far.\n\n635\n00:30:18.852 --> 00:30:20.104\nI know we have more to go though.\n\n636\n00:30:20.104 --> 00:30:20.932\n&gt;&gt; Would you?\n\n637\n00:30:20.932 --> 00:30:23.856\n&gt;&gt; We are rolling in,\ncontinuing of the fight.\n\n638\n00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:26.370\n&gt;&gt; And so I think part four at this point.\n\n639\n00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.518\nSo join us for that one, right?\n\n640\n00:30:28.518 --> 00:30:34.985\n[CROSSTALK] All right,\neveryone thanks for joining us.\n\n641\n00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:37.545\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n642\n00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:38.579\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n643\n00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:39.739\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n644\n00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:46.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n645\n00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:49.615\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n646\n00:30:55.177 --> 00:30:57.242\n&gt;&gt; Probably jump in, we may do.\n\n647\n00:30:57.242 --> 00:30:58.944\nWe'll probably break up\nthe demo separately, just so\n\n648\n00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:00.010\nwe have a nice you know session.\n\n649\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.900\nFor once we'll do that,\nthat will be part four.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Alright greetings everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.890\nAnd welcome back to another\ngret episode of ITProTv.\n\n5\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.080\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.540\nin today's episode we're coming back as\nmore on our CHFI question and answers.\n\n7\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.990\nI know you guys are enjoying it.\n\n8\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.340\nSo far, I surely have and joining us back\nwith the revelries our good friend and\n\n9\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.380\nmentor mister Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.590\nAdam glad to have you again man.\n\n11\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.196\n&gt;&gt; Need the trumpet.\n\n12\n00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:33.542\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[SOUND] &gt;&gt; Need the party.\n\n13\n00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:34.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Confetti and\n\n14\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.890\nall that stuff, festive hats.\n\n15\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.740\n&gt;&gt; The pyro.\n\n16\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we keep coming back to the pyro\n&gt;&gt; It's never gonna end.\n\n17\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.653\n&gt;&gt; We have not squared that box yet.\n\n18\n00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We do need to figure that out.\n\n19\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.420\nSo hopefully everybody is doing well.\n\n20\n00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.910\nPleasure to be back with you,\nas it always is.\n\n21\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.600\nWe're gonna continue our\nconversations around,\n\n22\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.930\nin this case, the hard drive\nfile system thought process.\n\n23\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.540\nWe've been through several\nepisodes up until now,\n\n24\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140\nall the various aspects that you should\nbe aware of both as an investigator,\n\n25\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.790\nif you're going to go out and obviously\nput these skills to use in the real world.\n\n26\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.880\nAs well as preparing to certify.\n\n27\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.590\nIn this regard becoming a CHFI.\n\n28\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.500\nIt does involve taking\nan exam at some point.\n\n29\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.640\nAnd you do wanna go\nthrough that information.\n\n30\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.160\nMake sure you're paying attention to\nthe things that we've pointed out.\n\n31\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.700\nDaniel and I have spent a lot\nof time discussing topics.\n\n32\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.485\nSome a little light and fluffy,\nothers a little bit more involved.\n\n33\n00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can safely ignore our conversations\n\n34\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.690\nabout culture and counterculture,\nin regards with exam preparation.\n\n35\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.990\nBut certainly the technical\naspects of those conversations.\n\n36\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.920\nThe moving parts of a hard drive for\ninstance, spent in episode one, some time.\n\n37\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.630\nPointing out to you, all the different\nthings that help make hard drives work,\n\n38\n00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.740\nthe way that it does.\n\n39\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.320\nWe talked about how storage is going\nto be carved up and allocated.\n\n40\n00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.860\nWhat a bit?\n\n41\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.560\nWhat a byte?\n\n42\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.980\nWhat a nibble would be?\n\n43\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.730\nDaniel favorite term for\nthat a tetrade as oppose to a nibble.\n\n44\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; A new term that\n\n45\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Were not aware of before.\n\n46\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.770\nSo we went through all this kind of stuff,\nencourage you to go back,\n\n47\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.100\ntake a look, make sure you're\ncomfortable with all that.\n\n48\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.790\nSpoke about some of the legalities\nassociated with how we access and\n\n49\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.830\nsearch in episodes before this, and\nthings that would brought forward,\n\n50\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.230\naffect the idea of the resident data on\na hard drive, and how we can access it.\n\n51\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.000\nUnder what terms and with what conditions\nand whether we do so legally and\n\n52\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.600\nforensically in a sound way.\n\n53\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.710\nOr not and if we don't, unfortunately that\nevents may not be able to be presented in\n\n54\n00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.095\nthis result, we may modify our ability\nto be able to successfully prosecute of\n\n55\n00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:24.025\nthis particularly activity that were\nengaged in in terms of maybe somebody is\n\n56\n00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.655\naccused of doing something and we wanna\nbe able to show that they did or did not.\n\n57\n00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:32.715\nWe have to be thinking all the time as\nan investigator about whether to not\n\n58\n00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.775\nwe're operation in a way that brings to\nthe table due care and due diligence.\n\n59\n00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.885\nTerms you'll often hear me refer to and\n\n60\n00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:41.800\nremind you of in various\npoints of our conversation.\n\n61\n00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.100\nSo we're gonna jump back in,\ncontinue our conversation.\n\n62\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.810\nWant to talk a bit about something\ncalled the HPA and the DCO.\n\n63\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.720\nAs always, plenty of acronyms here in\nthe pursuit of IT knowledge regardless of\n\n64\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.880\nwhat we're doing.\n\n65\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.570\nHPA, Host Protected Areas\nof the hard drive.\n\n66\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.750\nDCO, Device Configuration Overlay,\n\n67\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.340\nis another area of protected\nspace in the hard drive.\n\n68\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.350\nYou know,\na hard drive itself is this literally\n\n69\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.420\nmore often than not it\nhappens to be coloured black,\n\n70\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.770\nso it is a black box, although hard drives\ncan be of many variety shapes and colours.\n\n71\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.150\nBut it is a mythical black box in\nthe sense that we have been discussing,\n\n72\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.800\nquite a bit of stuff goes on inside of\nthere that we tend to take for granted,\n\n73\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.250\ndon't really spend time on.\n\n74\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.210\nI’m sure while most of you at some\npoint have thought about the structure\n\n75\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.840\nof a hard drive, the data contained within\nit, especially if you’ve gone through and\n\n76\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.180\nperhaps done some of the entry-level and\nmid-level IT technology certifications.\n\n77\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.200\nAnd many of us would find\nin a typical career path.\n\n78\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.935\nMany of you may have on your\nresumes the CompTIA exams.\n\n79\n00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.090\nA+, Network+, Security+, Cloud+, Storage+.\n\n80\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.668\nI could go on [CROSSTALK] plussing\nforever, there are so many.\n\n81\n00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:46.360\nBut whatever you may have done there.\n\n82\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.340\nPerhaps Microsoft, Cisco,\nVMware exams, the list goes on and on.\n\n83\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.360\nAnd a lot of that background knowledge is\nstuff that we would take, certainly know\n\n84\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.210\na use for exams, hopefully used in the\nreal world as we do the things we do, but\n\n85\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.760\nthen we kinda put some of that aside.\n\n86\n00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.560\nWe refer to things like\nthe OSI model every so often.\n\n87\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.863\nAnd it may be a long time\nbetween conversations.\n\n88\n00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.520\nIt's not the kind of thing you tend to\nsit down and talk about very often.\n\n89\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.760\nAnd although we apply that knowledge\nin the real world every day\n\n90\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.230\nwhen we do these jobs.\n\n91\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.340\nWe don't often stop and\n\n92\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.870\nthink about the connection back to\nwhere that knowledge comes from.\n\n93\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.820\nAnd back to the fundamental structural\nideas that that knowledge is built on.\n\n94\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960\nAnd as we look at the hard drive and\nreally think about it in this series of\n\n95\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.290\nepisodes we are really trying to do that,\ntrying to draw back to\n\n96\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.950\nthat fundamental knowledge and help you to\nbetter understand what is happening there.\n\n97\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.640\nSo, have you ever heard of the HPA and\n\n98\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.240\nthe DCO in terms of people\nreferring to them that way?\n\n99\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.250\n&gt;&gt; Negative, I have not.\n\n100\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.470\n&gt;&gt; And most people have not yet\nwe would often as we now will explain\n\n101\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.000\nwhat they are in just a minute we\nhave heard of these things and\n\n102\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.970\ncertainly have a sense of what they are\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n103\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.960\nwe don't often hear them\nreferred to formally.\n\n104\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.300\nAnd this is also one of those\nquirky things about our industry.\n\n105\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.810\nAbout IT in particular and what we do.\n\n106\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.910\nThere's a lot of this knowledge and\nmany of us many of you have and\n\n107\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.430\nhave fought hard and\nhave worked tirelessly to acquire.\n\n108\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.370\nBut sometimes we haven't\nput the capstone on that.\n\n109\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.290\nWe haven't formalized it by going back and\nreally understanding the theory and\n\n110\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.700\nthe linkage back to where it comes from.\n\n111\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.630\nAnd the explanation of the why right?\n\n112\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.880\nThe root cause knowledge, the foundational\nknowledge of what that really is.\n\n113\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.910\nAnd the exact specification or\nexplanation as to where it comes from and\n\n114\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.910\nwhy it function that way.\n\n115\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.900\nSo, that' what we're gonna\ntry to do with some of this.\n\n116\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.990\nThe HPA, reserve area on the hard\ndrive which is not uncommon.\n\n117\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.050\nWe tend to think about things like the\nvendor putting tools on there for recovery\n\n118\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.130\nwhich is usually a data recovery partition\non many hard drives, today in particular.\n\n119\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.320\nRight, so that kind of thing.\n\n120\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.840\nAnd we have tools that the vendor\nmay use to resize the drive,\n\n121\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.080\nto restore images, all that kind of stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.070\nThose kind of things will\nactually exist on the DCO,\n\n123\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.210\nthe device configuration overlay, where\nthe vendor in a stored protected area\n\n124\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.110\ncan put manipulation information,\nsize management information,\n\n125\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.630\ninformation about how they will recognize\nand interact with the drive, so that way\n\n126\n00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.030\ndrives of various sizes can be configured\nto have the same number of sectors.\n\n127\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.520\nThis is where the vendor\nitself will manipulate and\n\n128\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.170\nmanage the drive with their\nown drive in the DCO.\n\n129\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.110\nIn the HPA this is the reserved area where\nwe store data in a way that the user,\n\n130\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.325\nthe BIOS, the OS Cannot modified.\n\n131\n00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:17.275\nIt's essentially a read-only area that\nwe do not have access to interact with\n\n132\n00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:20.425\ndirectly to access to\nchange data in any way.\n\n133\n00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:23.565\nThis is where utilities,\ndiagnostic tools, the boot sector code,\n\n134\n00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:27.257\nthings like that that we talked\nabout Put and then size and\n\n135\n00:06:27.257 --> 00:06:31.397\ngeometry management, the geometry of the\nhard drive, will be done through the DCO.\n\n136\n00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:33.907\nSo, we have two protected areas.\n\n137\n00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:35.567\nWe don't interact with them typically,\nright.\n\n138\n00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:39.588\nThese are specifically designed for us not\nto interact back with them as end users.\n\n139\n00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:44.308\nBut again, unlikely that a bad actor would\nbe able to put data there, manipulate\n\n140\n00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:47.928\ninformation, unless they have access to\nthese tools that will let them do so.\n\n141\n00:06:47.928 --> 00:06:51.494\nBut not unheard of, and certainly if\nthey can get they being the bad actor.\n\n142\n00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.064\nCan get access to a set of OEM tools,\nright?\n\n143\n00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:56.744\nThe original equipment manufacturer tools.\n\n144\n00:06:56.744 --> 00:07:00.134\nIn other words, the vendor tools that\nare used to configure hard drives,\n\n145\n00:07:00.134 --> 00:07:05.364\nused to bulk image, bulk set up and\nspecify how those drives will\n\n146\n00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:08.864\nessentially leave the factory,\nconfigured to go into a system.\n\n147\n00:07:08.864 --> 00:07:10.744\nIf you can get access\nto those kind of tools.\n\n148\n00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:11.404\nAnd they do exist.\n\n149\n00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:14.584\nYou just have to obviously be\nfiguring out where to find them.\n\n150\n00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:16.580\nThen you can actually get into the drive.\n\n151\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.380\nAnd manipulate data in these areas.\n\n152\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.130\nYou may be able to secret data in there,\nor\n\n153\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.170\nin some cases inject data\nin there that may then\n\n154\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.900\ncause the drive to behave in a certain way\nthat normally we would not want it to.\n\n155\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.920\nWe're thinking malware for instance.\n\n156\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.300\nWe have to think about that because\nmost of the tools that we use,\n\n157\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.280\nis to be able to find that on\nthe drives and remember we are going to\n\n158\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.060\ndemonstrate some of this tools for\nyou in a little hands on walk through.\n\n159\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.450\nTake a look at some hex editors.\n\n160\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.060\nWe will take a look at\nthe ability to be able to load\n\n161\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.560\nof a command line version of tools.\n\n162\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.870\nFTK, forensics toolkit,\nexamine the geometry to drive.\n\n163\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.539\nLook at things like that.\n\n164\n00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:55.889\nThose tools are great, but most if not all\nthis tools are going to ignore these areas\n\n165\n00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.014\nbecause they are design not to see them.\n\n166\n00:07:58.014 --> 00:08:00.845\nIn other words,\nthese areas are permanently stealthed and\n\n167\n00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:04.750\nas a result we can't normally interact\nwith them as an investigator interact with\n\n168\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.330\nthe information there.\n\n169\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.870\nAnd this is a really big deal because you\nhave to have specific tools that will let\n\n170\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.690\nyou go in and see what's in there.\n\n171\n00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.760\nTools like EnCase,\nwe've talked about EnCase before.\n\n172\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.930\nEnCase can go in typically and\ncan image these areas.\n\n173\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.950\nTAFT, another tool, and ATA id forensics\ntool specifically designed for\n\n174\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.960\nolder drives,\nwould be able to be used for this.\n\n175\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.560\nThe Sleuth kit would be a tool that may\nbe able to image these partition area.\n\n176\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.380\nIt depends on the vendor, depends on the\ntools, but there are tools out there that\n\n177\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.670\ncan take these, particularly so\nthe hard drive on it work with them.\n\n178\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.600\nBut you know these are tools\nthat are number one,\n\n179\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.310\nthat kind of the gold standard\nin our forensics tool kit.\n\n180\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.565\nMeaning as a practicing investigator you\nwould typically have a tool like EnCase or\n\n181\n00:08:48.565 --> 00:08:52.650\nhave access to it, if this is what you\ndo professionally, so would not pose,\n\n182\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.900\nI should say, a huge challenge for\nyou to be able to go out and\n\n183\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.200\nuse a tool like this to\nget access to these areas.\n\n184\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200\nBut when you're starting out,\nsomebody's not bankrolling you,\n\n185\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.800\nyou're learning how to do this,\nyou're probably not gonna spend\n\n186\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.190\nthe kind of money it takes to go out and\nlicense EnCase and\n\n187\n00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.690\njust start using it, and as a result,\nyou may not have access to these tools.\n\n188\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.110\nAnd so we just have to understand\nthat there is a lot of information\n\n189\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.980\nin systems that we should be seeing, but\nwe may not have the knowledge, skills,\n\n190\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.740\nthe tools, to interact with it.\n\n191\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.950\nAs an investigator, this is a process.\n\n192\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.990\nYou never stop learning, you never stop\nknowing there's more things you have to\n\n193\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.290\ndo, there's always something\nelse that you could be doing\n\n194\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.120\nin an investigation to further enhance\nyour ability to understand, analyze, and\n\n195\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.050\npresent knowledge.\n\n196\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.410\nThe question is,\nis the investment of time, energy, and\n\n197\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.790\nmoney worth the return,\npotentially, right?\n\n198\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.935\nAnd the deeper we do the forensics\nanalysis the more information we find but\n\n199\n00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:47.015\nthere is that diminishing law of\nreturns where at some point we go so\n\n200\n00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:51.025\ndeep so wide into the system that we may\nbe spending more time than the information\n\n201\n00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:51.695\nwe're getting back.\n\n202\n00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:53.842\nAnd so\nwe just have to be thinking about that.\n\n203\n00:09:53.842 --> 00:09:55.922\nFile system analysis is\nalso very important.\n\n204\n00:09:55.922 --> 00:09:58.722\nWe've been balancing our conversations\nbetween the hard drive and\n\n205\n00:09:58.722 --> 00:10:01.772\nthe file system, kind of going back and\nforth between the two.\n\n206\n00:10:01.772 --> 00:10:06.396\nHard drive, a mechanical box where we\nstore things in one form or another.\n\n207\n00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:10.096\nAnd then the file system the stuff we tend\nto store, and put into the hard drive so\n\n208\n00:10:10.096 --> 00:10:11.564\nwe can then access data.\n\n209\n00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:13.556\nSo remember we've talked about\ndifferent characters sets,\n\n210\n00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:15.136\nwe've ASCII, we have Unicode.\n\n211\n00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:19.278\nWe mentioned them before in some of the\nintroductory episodes as we just laid out\n\n212\n00:10:19.278 --> 00:10:22.028\nfoundational knowledge but\nwe do have the ability to go in and\n\n213\n00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:27.288\nfollow system analysis look at ASCII\nin coding, look at Unicode in coding.\n\n214\n00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:29.018\nYou know the key difference\nbetween these two,\n\n215\n00:10:29.018 --> 00:10:32.008\nI know we talked about them a lot but\na lot of people don't realize that there\n\n216\n00:10:32.008 --> 00:10:34.959\nare differences in how we presented them\n&gt;&gt; I do know there are differences\n\n217\n00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:38.555\nin them, I just don't know the functional\naspect of that of what makes them\n\n218\n00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:39.954\ndifferent.\n\n219\n00:10:39.954 --> 00:10:43.334\n&gt;&gt; So one of the key things is\nthat the ASCII character set has\n\n220\n00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:44.684\na specified number of characters, right?\n\n221\n00:10:44.684 --> 00:10:49.290\nWe have the ability to present most of\nour information that we interact with,\n\n222\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.610\nthrough ASCII, character and coding\nstandard that is used in most computers.\n\n223\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.390\nWe have 128 specified characters,\ncoded into seven bit integers\n\n224\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.390\nthat are presenting, the letter A, the\nletter C, letter X, you know some codes or\n\n225\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:08.110\nrather characters things like that,\nand things that are the source code.\n\n226\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.600\nMacro, scripts, HTML, XML files.\n\n227\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.740\nThese are typically going to be\nconsidered ASCII files because\n\n228\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.780\nthey're coded that way.\n\n229\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.990\nSo what are the character sets?\n\n230\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.350\nWhen you think about the logic typically,\nprobably have numbers,\n\n231\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.160\nzero to nine most likely.\n\n232\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.070\nLower case upper case so\nA through Z, lower upper, right?\n\n233\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.872\nThose are gonna be incorporated there.\n\n234\n00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:29.330\nBasic punctuation, commas, exclamation\npoints, periods right things like that.\n\n235\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.610\nDon't forget semicolons,\nit is important got to have semicolons.\n\n236\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.150\nRight.\n\n237\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.260\nSo we have all that and\nyou know where ASCII came from?\n\n238\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.830\n&gt;&gt; I used to.\n\n239\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.560\nMan, what is the, I used to have\nthat on the tip of my tongue.\n\n240\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.290\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're like that,\nyeah, I've got that trivia,\n\n241\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.720\njust waiting to drop\ninto the conversation.\n\n242\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that used to be something\nI kept on the tip of my tongue,\n\n243\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.600\nand now it escapes me.\n\n244\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.990\n&gt;&gt; So huzzah, I stumped him, right?\n\n245\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is like a rare moment.\n\n246\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] High five.\n\n247\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.830\nAll right.\nSo, where does it come from,\n\n248\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.050\ncontrol codes that originated\nwith teletype machines.\n\n249\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.597\nThat's where ASCII actually comes from.\n\n250\n00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:00.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.580\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nBecause that is what the original\n\n252\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.060\ncharacter sets were for, they were encoded\nto be used in teletype machines not that\n\n253\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.655\nanybody out there for the most part\nprobably knows what a teletype machine is.\n\n254\n00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:12.585\nBut that's where this character set comes\nfrom, it's actually been around that long,\n\n255\n00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:15.255\ncuz it was one of the original\ncharacter sets used to send and\n\n256\n00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:18.905\nreceive information as we morphed into\nthis electronic ability to send or\n\n257\n00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.975\nreceive using teletype machines.\n\n258\n00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:25.035\nAnd then of course, we also use a space\nASCII character set does include a space.\n\n259\n00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:30.240\nSo we divide the ASCII table up into\nthree specific divisions, non-printable,\n\n260\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.550\nlower and then higher ASCII characters,\njust in case you were wondering.\n\n261\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.150\nAnd we have code ranges,\nnumber ranges that specify that.\n\n262\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.310\nBut there are characters that will not fit\ninto the standard ASCII character set.\n\n263\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.790\nSo we have Unicode.\n\n264\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.100\nThe computing standard\ndeveloped along with ASCII or\n\n265\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.170\nshortly thereafter kind of that\ncame up at different times.\n\n266\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.200\nBut this allows us to\nprovide unique numbers.\n\n267\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.650\nAgain, a numerical value\nrepresenting every character,\n\n268\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.620\nirrespective of what platform they're on.\n\n269\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.834\nSo Unicode, literally, will operate\non just about anything in the world.\n\n270\n00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:03.001\nProgram language [INAUDIBLE],\ndoesn't matter.\n\n271\n00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:06.914\nUnicode contains not just\nthe character sets in ASCII, but\n\n272\n00:13:06.914 --> 00:13:11.768\n128,000 characters from about\n135 modern and historically,\n\n273\n00:13:11.768 --> 00:13:15.460\nnow probably, long gone,\nscripts that can be used.\n\n274\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.573\nWhich means, it takes everything,\npretty much, that's ever been created, and\n\n275\n00:13:19.573 --> 00:13:23.272\nthought about being used, and sets it\nup so we can reference it, so when you\n\n276\n00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:27.620\nneed this crazy, kind of bizarre, unique,\nscientific character set that maybe is not\n\n277\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.420\nnormally used, chances are you're\nprobably doing it in Unicode, right?\n\n278\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.679\nBecause that's traditionally where\nwe would find that kind of stuff.\n\n279\n00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:38.223\nSo we wanna be thinking about the fact\nthat we have different character sets of\n\n280\n00:13:38.223 --> 00:13:42.045\nrepresentational foundational frameworks\nthat allow us to communicate.\n\n281\n00:13:42.045 --> 00:13:44.195\nAnd we often take these things for\ngranted, we think,\n\n282\n00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:47.140\nwell I'm just gonna type my letter out\nthere in my Outlook or Word editor and\n\n283\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.205\nI'll just go ahead and send it and\nsomebody will read it, no big deal.\n\n284\n00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.735\nBut how do those little bits and\n\n285\n00:13:51.735 --> 00:13:55.945\nbytes and actual representation of\nthe letters get translated back and forth?\n\n286\n00:13:55.945 --> 00:13:58.365\nHow does your platform,\nyour application see it?\n\n287\n00:13:58.365 --> 00:14:01.090\nHow does then all\nthe intervening systems see it.\n\n288\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.000\nAnd how do we ultimately reproduce it for\nthe user on the other side?\n\n289\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.190\nWe have to use one of these character\nsets in a file system to do that.\n\n290\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.050\nWithout a file system, we have no\nway of interacting with the data.\n\n291\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.670\nBecause the data itself must be\nrepresented as a series of characters that\n\n292\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.140\nthe file system allows us to see.\n\n293\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.240\nIt's kind of interesting when\nyou just think about peeling\n\n294\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.370\nback the layers, right?\n\n295\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.280\nOn that, take your choice,\nonion, artichoke,\n\n296\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.010\nwhatever vegetable that's multi-layered\nand has that kind of stuff.\n\n297\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.210\nBut if you think about peeling\nback all those layers, and\n\n298\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.860\nwe get down to that foundational, hey we\nneed this no matter what we do kind of\n\n299\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.520\nthought process the kernel that\nsits at the heart of that.\n\n300\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.830\nOr it could be a Tootsie Pop I suppose.\n\n301\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you remember those.\n\n302\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.420\n&gt;&gt; How many licks.\n\n303\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.660\n&gt;&gt; How many licks does it take to get\nto the center of the Tootsie Pop.\n\n304\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.980\nThe owl is-\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n305\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Three right.\n\n306\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.580\nBut when you think about that if\nwe take for granted which we do.\n\n307\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.680\nI mean how many of you stop and\n\n308\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.340\nthink about what kind of character set\nam I using to read this information?\n\n309\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.320\nYou just read it,\nyou don't ever stop and think about it.\n\n310\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.840\nBut as an investigator we would have to\nunderstand that we would need to be able\n\n311\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.450\nto have systems and indeed software\nthat does understand both ASCII and\n\n312\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.200\nUnicode so that we could truly understand\nthe nature of the information we see and\n\n313\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.790\nour forensics programs do but\n\n314\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.520\nwe have to ensure we're using the right\ncharacter sets to read the data.\n\n315\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.030\nChoose the wrong character set,\nthe data doesn't make sense.\n\n316\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.040\nChoose the right encoding mechanism,\nthe data does.\n\n317\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.230\nSo, we just have to think\nabout that as well.\n\n318\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.650\nWe need hex editors to be able to do this,\nwe're gonna take a look at one and\n\n319\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.360\ntake a look at what it may be.\n\n320\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.700\nOr at least how they work,\nwe'll show you what one looks like.\n\n321\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.270\nAs a matter of fact, if you give me just\none second I'll give you a little preview\n\n322\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.990\nof what one looks like here because\nI have one loaded up for us.\n\n323\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.760\nLet me just bring it up.\n\n324\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.430\nSo you can see here we have\na tool called Win Hex,\n\n325\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.250\nwe'll take a look at this in a little\nbit when we do our walk through.\n\n326\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.805\nBut a Hex Editor is really just\ngoing to allow me to go in I've\n\n327\n00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:44.942\nloaded a partition up here,\njust one of the image partitions we use.\n\n328\n00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:49.462\nAnd I've essentially gotten a tool\nthat let's me look at the data on\n\n329\n00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:51.856\nthe partition and see the raw data.\n\n330\n00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:53.121\nThe hex.\nThis is like looking at\n\n331\n00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:53.981\nthe matrix-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n332\n00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:57.989\n&gt;&gt; Right, if we look carefully enough,\nwe'll probably see Nero.\n\n333\n00:15:57.989 --> 00:15:59.069\nNot Nero.\n&gt;&gt; Neo.\n\n334\n00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.731\n&gt;&gt; Neo, thank you.\n\n335\n00:15:59.731 --> 00:16:00.875\n&gt;&gt; He's burning down the problem.\n\n336\n00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:02.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Nero is burning down.\n\n337\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.560\nYeah I don't know what\nI was thinking there.\n\n338\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.130\nI got old Rome on the brain for\nsome for some reason.\n\n339\n00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.080\nBut you'll see that we have all of\nthe different characters, right?\n\n340\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.030\nJust the random in our way of thinking\nabout a character sets that are here but\n\n341\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.210\nwe see this is the actual\ncode with the offset lines.\n\n342\n00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.305\nWe'll talk about offsets and\nwhy they are so important, but the off-set\n\n343\n00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:24.785\nhelps us to understand what line of\ndata we're looking at it, where it is,\n\n344\n00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:28.885\nand we can track data in the hard drive\nby looking at off-sets and saying,\n\n345\n00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:33.707\ncharacter 20, the off-set for character 20\nand so we would say, there's 15, right?\n\n346\n00:16:33.707 --> 00:16:35.872\nSo here's 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.\n\n347\n00:16:35.872 --> 00:16:38.988\nStarting at character 20,\nor offset 20 right there,\n\n348\n00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:43.197\nthere may be information we want to look\nat in the map to tell us certain things.\n\n349\n00:16:43.197 --> 00:16:46.708\nIs this this kind of a file, does it\ndo this, is it this kind of a user?\n\n350\n00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:50.158\nUser that may be accessing this file for\nlooking at other information.\n\n351\n00:16:50.158 --> 00:16:52.728\nThere's all this stuff that\nthe offsets will tell us.\n\n352\n00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:54.488\nAnd the offset is literally mapped out.\n\n353\n00:16:54.488 --> 00:16:57.218\nYou can see we go from 0 all the way\nover to 15 right at the top.\n\n354\n00:16:57.218 --> 00:16:59.808\nProbably see that, it's a little\nlight bit light, but right there.\n\n355\n00:16:59.808 --> 00:17:03.778\nAnd then we're just counting, so,\n0 to 15 and then we go again, right.\n\n356\n00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:05.908\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20 all the way across.\n\n357\n00:17:05.908 --> 00:17:07.990\nAnd we're looking at that on the offset.\n\n358\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:12.960\nMargin notation here tells us what we're\nup to, the beginning point here is in this\n\n359\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.510\ncase 96, or 112, we're adding 15 as we\ngo every time, and then iterating back.\n\n360\n00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.730\nAnd so we're mapping,\nliterally, the bits and\n\n361\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.550\nbytes of information in the drive,\nby looking at these blocks.\n\n362\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.330\nAnd then we get some information here,\nwe can see a lot of it is just garbage,\n\n363\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.210\nwe can't read it.\n\n364\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.080\nBut we do have some information\nthat may be human readable.\n\n365\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.810\nSo we can go through and\ntake a look at what the do to\n\n366\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.470\nallow us to actually grab the raw data and\nthen interpret it.\n\n367\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.960\nWe may be able to use tools to examine it.\n\n368\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.550\nWe've got a bunch of\ndifferent tools like this.\n\n369\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.800\nWe can open the disk.\n\n370\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.400\nWe can go in and\nwe can look at File Tools.\n\n371\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.740\nYou'll see we can go in and\ndo a comparison.\n\n372\n00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.490\nWe can look at Disk Tools here.\n\n373\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.960\nWe can go in and we can do File Recovery.\n\n374\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.275\nWe can do file recovery by type,\nso I can do a quick search for\n\n375\n00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:03.685\nfile types like .jpg, or .bmp,\nor whatever the file may be.\n\n376\n00:18:03.685 --> 00:18:08.395\nI can actually then based on the tool's\nability to read the raw code of the data I\n\n377\n00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:11.245\nthen will then be able to be presented\nwith all the files that meet this\n\n378\n00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:12.352\ntype on the drive.\n\n379\n00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:13.512\nAnd where they're located.\n\n380\n00:18:13.512 --> 00:18:15.842\nSo this is how we start to\ndo the forensic analysis.\n\n381\n00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:19.892\nWe're again assuming we actually have\nan image that does forensically sound this\n\n382\n00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:20.622\nimage I'm working on.\n\n383\n00:18:20.622 --> 00:18:25.172\nIn theory, right, remember the thought\nprocess, the mindset we've been using on\n\n384\n00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:28.376\nthis particular machine or\nset of machines we're always demoing on.\n\n385\n00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:30.046\nThis is our forensic work station.\n\n386\n00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:32.346\nWe've got our forensically\nsound capabilities,\n\n387\n00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.736\nour software, our methodologies in play.\n\n388\n00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.796\nWhenever we're looking at data, again,\n\n389\n00:18:36.796 --> 00:18:40.376\nthe assumption as we're doing this is\nwe have a forensically sound image.\n\n390\n00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:44.006\nSo we're using a secondary image that\nwe're always using, not the standard or\n\n391\n00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:45.286\nthe primary image, right?\n\n392\n00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:48.706\nSo as a result, if I did something\nlike this where I'd go and.\n\n393\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.570\nAnd I say hey show me for instance since\nwe're here what kind of files may be here.\n\n394\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.220\nWe're gonna do a file header search, we're\ngonna look at the headers of the files and\n\n395\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.370\ntry to find by type the code information.\n\n396\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.665\nAt a certain set that says,\nthis based on this code zero seven,\n\n397\n00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:05.905\nthis will probably be a jpg.\n\n398\n00:19:05.905 --> 00:19:08.405\nZero ten this will probably bitmap or\nwhatever it is.\n\n399\n00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:10.805\nAnd based on that,\nwe than can pull those in and\n\n400\n00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:13.075\nsay likely that these files are this.\n\n401\n00:19:13.075 --> 00:19:15.180\nAnd that's what we do through\nthe entire character set.\n\n402\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:15.770\nOn the drive.\nSo\n\n403\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.510\nlook at the things we can search for here.\n\n404\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:22.440\nWe have pictures, documents, email,\ninternet files, archives, music,\n\n405\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.450\nvideos, music or video,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n406\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.820\nPrograms, all sorts of stuff, application\ndata, and under any one of these,\n\n407\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.930\nright I've got, if you take a look here,\nlook at all the file extensions and type.\n\n408\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.400\nJpeg, png, gif, thumbnails, right?\n\n409\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.360\nCanon, paintshop pro,\ntiff, I mean you name it,\n\n410\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.260\nlook at there is probably 30 or\n40 different graphic types here.\n\n411\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.670\nI mean some of these you\nprobably never heard of, right?\n\n412\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.570\nKaist thumb, right?\n\n413\n00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:52.590\nMSO document image, account picture,\nhow about Adobe bridge or ZB thumbnail.\n\n414\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.900\nNever heard of that one, right.\n\n415\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.570\nCalamus Vector Graphic.\n\n416\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.470\nThese are some, obviously there\nare programs that use these extensions,\n\n417\n00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.360\nand we may not be familiar\nwith them as an investigator.\n\n418\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.740\nWe may not have heard of some of these.\n\n419\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.460\nThere are some on that list\nI've never come across.\n\n420\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.320\nBut that doesn't mean they're not valid.\n\n421\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.030\nIt just means I probably haven't\nworked with this program before.\n\n422\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.570\nBut somebody who maybe works in, I don't\nknow, engineering, or graphic design,\n\n423\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.020\nright, will most likely have come across\none more need typesetting for printing,\n\n424\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.640\nremember once a program is used, all the\ntime, I can't remember, not Quick Books,\n\n425\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.730\nI can't remember that\n\n426\n00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.260\nit was a graphics program like that\nThe day that was really, really popular.\n\n427\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.750\nYou used to.\n&gt;&gt; I remember Corel Draw was pretty\n\n428\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.320\npopular back in the day.\n\n429\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no, not that.\n\n430\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.830\nIt was like it was done specifically for\ntypesetting.\n\n431\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.830\nLike, before Publisher and\nstuff, there was like a program.\n\n432\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.520\n&gt;&gt; I bet Vonne would know.\n\n433\n00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she probably would.\n\n434\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I guarantee you she'd know.\n\n435\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.860\n&gt;&gt; It was one of these.\n\n436\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Cuz when I first started out,\n\n437\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.040\nlike a million years ago, and\nI was just starting out teaching,\n\n438\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.000\nworking for probably can say New Horizons.\n\n439\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.860\nSome of you may know I worked for\nNew Horizons for many, many years.\n\n440\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.663\nBut when it first started out doing\nthat while I was an apps instructor,\n\n441\n00:20:54.663 --> 00:20:56.215\nas many people started out doing that.\n\n442\n00:20:56.215 --> 00:21:01.390\nI taught Office 95 and Windows 95 and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n443\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.890\nBut there was this graphics program.\n\n444\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.430\nI can't remember.\n\n445\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.000\nIt was a type setting program for\npublishing.\n\n446\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.890\nI can't remember what it was.\n\n447\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It used a really weird\n\n448\n00:21:07.053 --> 00:21:08.776\nfile extension but\nI just can't remember it now.\n\n449\n00:21:08.776 --> 00:21:11.013\nBut anyway, so you would go and\nyou would check all this off, right.\n\n450\n00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:13.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you may go in and specify,\n\n451\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.330\nokay hey, I wanna find them, output them\nhere, like, tell me where they are, right?\n\n452\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.800\nAnd go in, and click okay.\n\n453\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.090\nYou can see it's just going through, and\nit's looking, and it's finding, right?\n\n454\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.820\nJust kinda searching, doing its stuff.\n\n455\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.530\nOkay, looks like we found\na whole bunch of stuff.\n\n456\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.040\nAnd then, I can go out and\nI can take a look at the output.\n\n457\n00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.390\nAnd I can actually see what they are.\n\n458\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.100\nAnd see the files for instance,\nrather see the pictures.\n\n459\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.860\nSee, this kind of stuff is\nwhat we do with a hex editor.\n\n460\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.640\nWe actually can go out at that point and\ntake a look at the output,\n\n461\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.860\nyou can see what pictures were found or\nget a list of emails, right?\n\n462\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.130\nAnd whatever would be, right?\n\n463\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.910\nSo we could do all of that kind of stuff,\n\n464\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.160\nwe could do detailed searching here,\nright?\n\n465\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.210\nSimultaneous search and\nparse, various things.\n\n466\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.129\nThere's all this different stuff, do\ndirectory browsing, volume snapshotting.\n\n467\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.750\nThe list goes on and on.\n\n468\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.390\nI can look at hex, I can look at\ncharacter set, text display only.\n\n469\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.990\nAnd when you look at character set,\nwe were just talking about ANSI.\n\n470\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.710\nYou'll see I have ANSI character.\n\n471\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.225\nI have Unicode,\ndifferent kinds of Unicode there.\n\n472\n00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:14.335\nI could switch up the display to show me\nthe different kinds of character sets,\n\n473\n00:22:14.335 --> 00:22:19.005\nto show me the data and as a result be\nable to then work with it and filter and\n\n474\n00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.525\nyou know, use tools specific to that.\n\n475\n00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:22.825\nRight?\nSo if I change from NC and\n\n476\n00:22:22.825 --> 00:22:25.545\nI change into Unicode,\nthe display differs and\n\n477\n00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:30.095\nyou could see the character sets differ,\nthe offsets stay the same but\n\n478\n00:22:30.095 --> 00:22:35.625\nthe ideas that now I'm actually able to\nchange the way I'm looking at this, right?\n\n479\n00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:39.010\nAnd I'm just changing the different\ncharacter sets as I do that.\n\n480\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.990\nSo I can go in and I actually can just\nchange this up and then modify or\n\n481\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.450\nlook at the data a different way.\n\n482\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.690\nSo its kind of interesting.\n\n483\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.560\nThe hex editor lets us look\nessentially at the binary data, right?\n\n484\n00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.699\nThat's really what the hex editor does,\nhas all of these different opportunities\n\n485\n00:22:53.699 --> 00:22:57.557\nand availability tools for us to be\nable to filter, display, search, etc.\n\n486\n00:22:57.557 --> 00:22:59.808\nBut what we're doing is\nlooking at the hacks or\n\n487\n00:22:59.808 --> 00:23:02.210\nrather at the binary data through a hex.\n\n488\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.880\nNow we have to be able to convert back and\nforth, right?\n\n489\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.640\nSo, on of the things, let me just\nbring this up for you real quickly.\n\n490\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.970\nGive me just one second and\nwhoops, that's not the one I want.\n\n491\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.438\nSo, I wanna bring up a little file\nthat I created for us that will be\n\n492\n00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:22.110\nimported and, right here, one second.\n\n493\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.800\nWhere did I put that file?\n\n494\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.311\nIt's on the desktop I know why,\n\n495\n00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:32.424\nbecause I'm in the [CROSSTALK] I'm in\nthe right idea but the wrong desktop.\n\n496\n00:23:32.424 --> 00:23:35.863\nI keep forgetting I've got two VMs\nessentially that look identical,\n\n497\n00:23:35.863 --> 00:23:37.490\ntwo Windows 10 machines.\n\n498\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.460\nI just need the right one\nwith the right files.\n\n499\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.310\nSo, what we could see there, let me\njust make this a little bigger, just so\n\n500\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.054\nit's a little bit easier for\nyou guys to see.\n\n501\n00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:47.921\nAnd the two square centimeters of\nspace I have on the desk there.\n\n502\n00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:48.533\nThere we go.\n\n503\n00:23:48.533 --> 00:23:52.086\nAll right, so what we're looking at here\nis just a spreadsheet that I have actually\n\n504\n00:23:52.086 --> 00:23:53.833\nused this in a bunch of different shows.\n\n505\n00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:57.960\nWe used this in the server\n2016 networking discussions.\n\n506\n00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.470\nWhen I did that set of shows with\nCherokee to walk you through IPv6 and\n\n507\n00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.990\nhow that works.\n\n508\n00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.763\nBut you can see here,\nI just have a quick chart that I created.\n\n509\n00:24:05.763 --> 00:24:07.085\nWith the decimal equivalent or\n\n510\n00:24:07.085 --> 00:24:09.765\nwith the base ten equivalent\nyou can think of it either way.\n\n511\n00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:11.285\nThe binary and the hex.\n\n512\n00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:14.795\nAnd so\nwhen I look at a number seven in binary,\n\n513\n00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:17.625\nit's zero one one one in\nhex it is seven right?\n\n514\n00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:18.542\nIn hexadecimal.\n\n515\n00:24:18.542 --> 00:24:23.072\nWhen I look at 15 the binary equivalent\nis 4 1s and the, that space to\n\n516\n00:24:23.072 --> 00:24:26.612\nrepresent all the information\nnecessary to make the number 15.\n\n517\n00:24:26.612 --> 00:24:31.832\nBut in Hex, it is the letter F because\nin Hex we do zero through nine and\n\n518\n00:24:31.832 --> 00:24:33.152\nthen we do A through F.\n\n519\n00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:34.812\nThat's the character set essentially,\nright?\n\n520\n00:24:34.812 --> 00:24:35.972\nThat we specify.\n\n521\n00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:39.732\nAnd so understanding how to\nconvert between binary, data and\n\n522\n00:24:39.732 --> 00:24:42.500\nHex is what the Winhex or\nany kind of Hex editor does.\n\n523\n00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.550\nIt shows us, not the binary data,\nbut converts the binary data\n\n524\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.220\ninto the Hex form that we're looking at\nand when we go back and we take a look.\n\n525\n00:24:52.494 --> 00:24:54.950\nAnd we look at this, right?\n\n526\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.170\nWhat I jokingly referred to as\nthe matrix view of the data,\n\n527\n00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.240\nthat's actually the hex data.\n\n528\n00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.360\nWe're not seeing the underlying binary,\n\n529\n00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.680\nwhat we're seeing is the binary\nconverted into the hex.\n\n530\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.010\nAnd we can literally go convert each\nof those hex items into binary data,\n\n531\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.620\nwhich is what the editor does\nto be able to let us access it.\n\n532\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.970\nThat's how we go back and forth.\n\n533\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.890\nWe just don't do that manually because\nit would just be, think about it.\n\n534\n00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.564\n&gt;&gt; Incredibly time consuming.\n\n535\n00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:17.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Time consuming.\n\n536\n00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.620\n&gt;&gt; I mean, imagine the space.\n\n537\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.220\nThe amount of data we deal with today.\n\n538\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.750\nCould you actually go in and do that?\n\n539\n00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.315\nThere would be no way for us,\nas humans to actually sit and do.\n\n540\n00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:25.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just what-\n\n541\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:25.700\n&gt;&gt; You'd be so\n\n542\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.290\nprone to errors doing that as well,\n\n543\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.689\nthat you probably couldn't rely on\nthe data that you did extrapolate, so.\n\n544\n00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:33.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's not a realistic endeavor for us.\n\n545\n00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:34.169\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n546\n00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:37.877\n&gt;&gt; There's too much data, we're too prone\nto errors as Daniel suggested, right?\n\n547\n00:25:37.877 --> 00:25:40.439\nBecause there's just so much data and\nimagine, okay wait, where was I?\n\n548\n00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:41.873\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I Was on character?\n\n549\n00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; God I got to start over again?\n\n550\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would be horrible.\n\n551\n00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.295\nSo we have machine tools, right?\n\n552\n00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:49.395\nThat do all this for us, clearly, but\nthis is what we're thinking about.\n\n553\n00:25:49.395 --> 00:25:52.730\nWe're able to search for\ndeleted data in hidden partitions.\n\n554\n00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.230\nAll sorts of stuff would go on there,\nright?\n\n555\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.640\nAnd we would be able to go in and find it.\n\n556\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.460\nAnd we're doing essentially,\nwhat we call file carving, right?\n\n557\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.060\nWe're going in and\n\n558\n00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.170\nwe're looking for files and pulling\nthem out based on parsing this data.\n\n559\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.520\nWe're recovering data from fragments and\npieces.\n\n560\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.750\nTypically in either damaged areas or\n\n561\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.870\nunallocated areas of\nspace on the hard drive.\n\n562\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.670\nUsing an editor like this,\nthere are many editors,\n\n563\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.520\nthis is just one, any hex-editor will\ndo the same thing that this one does.\n\n564\n00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.360\nThis is just a common one, it's free, you\ncan use it in Windows, it's easy to do.\n\n565\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.090\nAnd Kali Linux for instance in the set\nof security engineering toolset,\n\n566\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.010\nyou've got a bunch of different tools.\n\n567\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.190\nYou have Hex editors there, we could\nget them from just about anywhere.\n\n568\n00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.380\nFile carving is just\nthe idea of extracting files\n\n569\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.630\nout of either the unallocated or\ndamaged spaces in the hard drive.\n\n570\n00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.380\nAnd then we just have to think\nabout the different kinds of files.\n\n571\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.660\nLike I was suggesting,\nI just did a search for JPEG or PNG or\n\n572\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.460\nwhatever the extension would be.\n\n573\n00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.180\nAnd we have different file types, right?\n\n574\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.050\nWe have JPEG files,\nwe have bitmap files, we have GIF files,\n\n575\n00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.920\nthese are all graphic\nformats of different files.\n\n576\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.190\nPNG, all these different ones.\n\n577\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.480\nPDF files, right?\n\n578\n00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.460\nThat kind of thing.\n\n579\n00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.430\nAnd you know there are Hex values\nthat we will use to identify,\n\n580\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.150\nas I was suggesting, these file types.\n\n581\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.817\nIf you look in the show notes,\n\n582\n00:27:05.817 --> 00:27:09.435\nI've got a list of these file types and\nthe unique identifiers.\n\n583\n00:27:09.435 --> 00:27:14.379\nFor instance, the PDF file format,\nalways begins with a Hex value of 25,\n\n584\n00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:17.171\n50, 44, 46, 2 characters each.\n\n585\n00:27:17.171 --> 00:27:20.544\nSo if we go back just for a minute,\nnot that I have a PDF here, but\n\n586\n00:27:20.544 --> 00:27:24.071\nif we go fullscreen just for\na minute, hypothetically, right?\n\n587\n00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:26.810\nSo what we're looking for, let me\njust show you something here, right?\n\n588\n00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.610\nWhat we're looking for is,\nthat the PDF equal the file.\n\n589\n00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:35.250\nWhat did I say, 25 50 44 and 46, right?\n\n590\n00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:42.260\nSo we would be looking for this string\nright here in this data, right?\n\n591\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.600\nWe would be looking for let's say,\n\n592\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.880\nsomething not that it equates to this\nobviously it's not the same characters.\n\n593\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.040\nBut in theory we'd be looking at\nthe first four items there and saying,\n\n594\n00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.180\nokay if those if those four items line\nup and meet that particular string\n\n595\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.950\nof numbers, then the file in that space,\nthat data is gonna be of type PDF.\n\n596\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.390\nIf it is going to be something different.\n\n597\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:08.560\nLet's say if it is going to be a GIF or\nnot a GIF, a PNG, right?\n\n598\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.260\nWhich I think is the file\ntype we did a search for.\n\n599\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:16.007\nPNG whoops, PNG is going to be 89,\nwhoops, 89.\n\n600\n00:28:16.007 --> 00:28:16.510\nWhat is that?\n\n601\n00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.030\n&gt;&gt; 50.\n\n602\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.998\n&gt;&gt; 54 E, right?\n\n603\n00:28:17.998 --> 00:28:20.773\nAnd so we would be looking for\nthat string.\n\n604\n00:28:20.773 --> 00:28:25.849\nAnd trying to find those when I did\nthe search for PNG as it went through,\n\n605\n00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:31.450\nit's looking for that series of two\nletter or number blocks of texts, right?\n\n606\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:36.360\nThe Hex characters and it's then gonna\ntag those files that's start that way and\n\n607\n00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.730\nsay okay, those are PNG files.\n\n608\n00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.000\nThose are PDF files.\n\n609\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.190\nAnd that's how we actually are doing\nthe search, when we go in and\n\n610\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.480\ndo the search string using a Hex editor.\n\n611\n00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.400\nIt's really just a matter\nof matching these codes.\n\n612\n00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.270\nBut by knowing what the file type is,\nthe designator, right?\n\n613\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.620\nThat tells us this file begins this way,\nwe're actually filtering and\n\n614\n00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.510\nlooking for those strings.\n\n615\n00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:58.380\nIt's pretty cool when you think\nabout the fact that every file\n\n616\n00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.300\nhas some of this unique\nfile type association.\n\n617\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.690\nThis string somewhere in the beginning\nthat says this is this file type.\n\n618\n00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.170\n&gt;&gt; I like, yeah that's one of my favorite\nways of uploading malicious code is\n\n619\n00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.040\nthrough exploitation of\nusing these file types.\n\n620\n00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.243\n&gt;&gt; Manipulating or making it look\nlike a different file than it is.\n\n621\n00:29:13.243 --> 00:29:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I do.\n\n622\n00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.470\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; And when you think about it,\n\n623\n00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.940\nwhen we change the file extension,\njust going a little bit further,\n\n624\n00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.520\na little bit higher up in the stack into\nthe application layer where we typically\n\n625\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.230\ninteract with data.\n\n626\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.720\nBecause we don't normally, as I said,\nwe don't normally see data at this level.\n\n627\n00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.510\nWe don't, as an average person,\nreally even know or think about this.\n\n628\n00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.800\nBut this is what bad actors do,\n\n629\n00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.260\nthis is what hackers are going to do to\nmanipulate that as Daniel was suggesting.\n\n630\n00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.830\nBut when you think about the fact that in\na graphical editor like Windows Explorer\n\n631\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:43.240\nor whatever the case may be, you could go\nin and change a file extension, right?\n\n632\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.570\nMake a PDF into, I don't know,\na spreadsheet or whatever.\n\n633\n00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.055\nTo fool the graphical editor\njust into displaying it,\n\n634\n00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:50.574\nas if it's different file type.\n\n635\n00:29:50.574 --> 00:29:53.380\nBut you're not really manipulating or\nmodifying the data itself.\n\n636\n00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.165\nIf we did that, people don't often\nthink about this and realize that.\n\n637\n00:29:56.165 --> 00:29:58.555\nIf we did that,\nwe wouldn't change to this code.\n\n638\n00:29:58.555 --> 00:30:00.465\nThis code would actually stay the same,\n\n639\n00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:04.025\nbecause it's encoded when we create\nthe file, not based on the file extension.\n\n640\n00:30:04.025 --> 00:30:06.545\nSo, we can manipulate it\nin the graphical editor.\n\n641\n00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:09.395\nBut then, if we did an analysis of it,\nwe'd actually still find it.\n\n642\n00:30:09.395 --> 00:30:13.310\nWhich is why when we look at file\ntypes and we see, this is interesting.\n\n643\n00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.605\nIt's not a PowerPoint presentation,\nit actually is.\n\n644\n00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:17.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A Word Document or something.\n\n645\n00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.630\nWe would know because we actually\nlooked for these Hex codes,\n\n646\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.170\nthese ASCII code strings.\n\n647\n00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.120\nAnd that's how we actually tell.\n\n648\n00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.743\n&gt;&gt; And if you add, for example, I like to\nuse GIFs because a lot of file upload,\n\n649\n00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:30.735\nto get to my malicious code,\nthey allow me to upload.\n\n650\n00:30:30.735 --> 00:30:33.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz GIFs are pretty standard to see.\n\n651\n00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:36.195\n&gt;&gt; But\nthey'll say I only accept picture files.\n\n652\n00:30:36.195 --> 00:30:36.745\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n653\n00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:39.850\n&gt;&gt; So I'll put GIF98A\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning of my file and then\n\n654\n00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.780\nname it whatever.GIF, even though it's\njust a big fat pile of malicious code.\n\n655\n00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To allow me shell access.\n\n656\n00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.420\n&gt;&gt; But you'll put that in-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n657\n00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.630\nbecause of that code the system will\ninterpret and go, hey this is a GIF file,\n\n658\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.130\nI don't know what the heck\nis going on after that.\n\n659\n00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.940\nBut it's a GIF, by god and you'll see\na little broken tile or whatever,\n\n660\n00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.420\nit won't show a picture obviously.\n\n661\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.360\nBut it will allow that codec.\n\n662\n00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.500\n&gt;&gt; And that is actually a good warning\nsign, when you go to preview a lot of this\n\n663\n00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.360\nstuff as an investigator, and\nyou saw we did a couple of demos in\n\n664\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.560\nsome of the earlier episodes where we\npreviewed a couple of picture files.\n\n665\n00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.045\nIf you remember I brought up\nthe black Twitter, swan or dove.\n\n666\n00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:11.635\nWhat is it?\nA dove?\n\n667\n00:31:11.635 --> 00:31:12.345\nWhatever it is.\n\n668\n00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:14.175\nAnd it was black on the background\nof the black editor.\n\n669\n00:31:14.175 --> 00:31:15.726\nWe couldn't see it.\nAnd I said, let's switch over and\n\n670\n00:31:15.726 --> 00:31:16.758\nwe were able to see it, no trouble.\n\n671\n00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:17.938\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n672\n00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:20.591\n&gt;&gt; But if you actually had that\ncome up and it didn't display,\n\n673\n00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:23.760\nnot saying that a preview does or\ndoes not mean the data's valid.\n\n674\n00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.490\nBut to Daniel's point,\nwhen you can't look at a file and\n\n675\n00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.410\npreview it using the proper viewer,\n\n676\n00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.780\nthat's usually an indicator that the file\nis not what it purports to be, right?\n\n677\n00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That usually there is\n\n678\n00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.680\nsome sort of code in the beginning,\nlike we showed you,\n\n679\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.285\nmay have been manipulated\nto make it appear, right?\n\n680\n00:31:37.285 --> 00:31:41.375\nAt the most base level of the data that it\nis a file of this type, but throughout as\n\n681\n00:31:41.375 --> 00:31:45.085\nit doesn't have the structure and\nthe actual data that's associated with it.\n\n682\n00:31:45.085 --> 00:31:47.017\nIt has other data probably even code or\nsomething.\n\n683\n00:31:47.017 --> 00:31:48.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we may not be able to view it and\n\n684\n00:31:48.835 --> 00:31:51.197\nthat's another indicator to\nus since as we look at files.\n\n685\n00:31:51.197 --> 00:31:54.397\nThat there may be something unusual there,\nand now we wanna go in and\n\n686\n00:31:54.397 --> 00:31:55.817\ngrab that file and\n\n687\n00:31:55.817 --> 00:32:00.052\nreally open it up and start examining it\nin a much more thorough and deeper level.\n\n688\n00:32:00.052 --> 00:32:02.597\nBecause chances are good we're seeing\nsomething that is actually gonna be of\n\n689\n00:32:02.597 --> 00:32:03.117\ninterest to us.\n\n690\n00:32:03.117 --> 00:32:04.970\nSo It is a good warning sign for us.\n\n691\n00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.170\nYou're hearing it right from somebody who\ndoes this and certainly is showing you and\n\n692\n00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.900\nsharing with you their knowledge and\ntheir secrets.\n\n693\n00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.420\n&gt;&gt; And now Daniel's gotta come up with a\nnew way to infect people because everyone\n\n694\n00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.462\nknows that we can't accept gifts\nfrom Daniel, if they come from him.\n\n695\n00:32:17.462 --> 00:32:18.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n696\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.720\nAll right, so beware Daniel's brain gifts\nas supposed to Trojans brain gifts, right?\n\n697\n00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.260\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n698\n00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.300\nso just some insight into file system,\nhard drive and\n\n699\n00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.000\nthe combination of these two with regards\nto data structure, a characters sets and\n\n700\n00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.500\nhow we would use in this case\na Hex editor to show you right?\n\n701\n00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.700\nWhat this actually is and give you\nkind of a taste of what that hands\n\n702\n00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.710\non demonstration is going\nto be that's coming up.\n\n703\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.740\nBecause that was one of the pieces\nthat I was going to show you.\n\n704\n00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.310\nBut we've got some interesting\nstuff still left in that demo.\n\n705\n00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.760\nWe're going to take a look at the,\none of the toolkits,\n\n706\n00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:56.130\nthe command line toolkits that has tools\nlike iStat and FLS in it and the Fstat.\n\n707\n00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.740\nWe're gonna take a look at the TSK,\nthe sleuth kit, as I mentioned.\n\n708\n00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.990\nI'll walk you through the command line and\nthe thought process of how to interrogate\n\n709\n00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.910\na drive and look for data without\nnecessarily using a visual editor.\n\n710\n00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.000\nSo that will be a cool little demo,\n\n711\n00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.030\nwe'll do that when we come\nback in our next step so.\n\n712\n00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm totally looking forward to that,\n\n713\n00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.600\nI love demonstrations, it's gonna be\na lot of fun, so join us back for that.\n\n714\n00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.110\nAs for this episode,\nhopefully you guys got a lot out of it.\n\n715\n00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.260\nThere was a lot of great\ninformation here today.\n\n716\n00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.080\nBut time for us to sign off, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n717\n00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.935\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

going well, going well.\n\n9\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540\nHopefully goes equally well for\nall of you out there.\n\n10\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.120\nWe are gonna jump in, kinda pick up.\n\n11\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.985\nWe did slide in to our demo in part one\nanyway, at the end of our last discussion.\n\n12\n00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:39.786\n&gt;&gt; Was a teaser trailer.\n\n13\n00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:41.970\n&gt;&gt; It was kind of like that,\nit was exactly that.\n\n14\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.850\nSo we're gonna go back in actually pick up\nthe thread where we left off with Win Hex.\n\n15\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.393\nBecause I wanted to show you something.\n\n16\n00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:47.310\nI did the search but\n\n17\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.108\nI actually forgot to show you where\nthe output goes I preview the file.\n\n18\n00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:55.660\nSo we got so wrapped up in talking about\nwhat you could do and file typing, code,\n\n19\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.330\nand how we recognize files that I didn't\nactually show you the output of that.\n\n20\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.540\nSo I thought we'd just jump back in\nquickly to show you what happens when we\n\n21\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.150\ndo the file search in Win Hex.\n\n22\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.497\nThen we're gonna go over,\n\n23\n00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:08.613\ntake a look at a Windows 7 Machine\nrunning the sleuth toolkit.\n\n24\n00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:12.753\nAnd we'll take a look at that and do some\ncommand line work on how to look at a raw\n\n25\n00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:16.451\npartition, and actually take a look\nat all the different files, but\n\n26\n00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.530\nfrom a non-graphical perspective.\n\n27\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.640\nEssentially the same thing we do with\nthe hex editor, but from the command line.\n\n28\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.131\nSo we're back in Win Hex,\nlet's assume this is the same image,\n\n29\n00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.118\nbecause it is that we did\nthe search on if you remember.\n\n30\n00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:31.884\nWhat we did is we went in here and\nwe went to tools and\n\n31\n00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:35.944\nwe went to this tools and\nwe did file recovery by type.\n\n32\n00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:40.179\nI just went ahead and I did a search for\nthis case Graphics files, and\n\n33\n00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.780\nwhen we did that we would specify\nthe output directory so I did that.\n\n34\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.250\nAnd that output directory is going\nto just be sitting on the desktop.\n\n35\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.422\nI just went in and I just created\na folder called win hex recovered and\n\n36\n00:01:51.422 --> 00:01:54.886\nyou can see there were just some files\nshowing up in the background there.\n\n37\n00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:59.370\nBMP, GIF files, JPEG, whatever file\ntypes may have been recovered and\n\n38\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.102\nthen PNG, there's a bunch of thumbnails.\n\n39\n00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:05.415\nYou saw some of them in\nthe background a minute ago but\n\n40\n00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:10.308\nwe get this nice little file recovery by\ntype file that actually shows us all of\n\n41\n00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:14.018\nthe different file types that\nwere going to be recovered.\n\n42\n00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:18.846\nAnd or looked at that massive list of\nall the file types that I looked at and\n\n43\n00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:20.905\nit just gives us information,\n\n44\n00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:25.250\nbut the other thing is It shows\nus the Headers as well, right?\n\n45\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230\nSo we can see Header information,\nwe could see size information, and\n\n46\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.130\nURL tells us that the default size would\nbe this, the header for Canon raw would\n\n47\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.060\nbe the this, the header for\nAdobe Photoshop would be this, right?\n\n48\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.450\nSo if we don't know what those\nheaders are, we actually can go in and\n\n49\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.400\nwe can take a look.\n\n50\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.720\nIt will help us to better\nunderstand some of that as well.\n\n51\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.045\nSo it gives us some nice information,\nand just walks through and we can see\n\n52\n00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:54.475\nonce we see the list of all the file\ntypes that we checked off and look for.\n\n53\n00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:58.905\nIt will show us,\nright that we can see and find files but\n\n54\n00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:02.255\nit shows us if with\nthe evaluation that I'm using\n\n55\n00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:06.205\nthat if they're not gonna be under 200k\nin size we're not able to save them.\n\n56\n00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.395\nSo it tags the files with\nthe demo versions, right?\n\n57\n00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:12.550\nThat we're not able to save but\nit does give us all the information\n\n58\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.730\nabout all the files,\nas you can see, that were found.\n\n59\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.641\nQuite a few of them broken out by area.\n\n60\n00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:22.590\nAnd we can see all the PNGs, right, as I\njust kind of scroll up and down there.\n\n61\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.610\nAnd it just gives us a listing\nof all of those files.\n\n62\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.870\nSo the full, the file itself,\n\n63\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.905\nthe Win, the output of the Win hex\nis always helpful to investigators,\n\n64\n00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:36.320\ncuz it does show us all the information\nand shows us what we're working with.\n\n65\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.760\nSo we get a declarative file that acts as\na manifest, an inventory that we could\n\n66\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.570\nthen put in as part of our artefacts\nwhen we create a case, right?\n\n67\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.530\nSo that's just nice to see.\n\n68\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.380\nAll right so let's go in,\nlet's jump over to the Windows 7 box.\n\n69\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.550\nI've got that running right here.\n\n70\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.120\nWe can go full screen cuz I'm\ngonna be over part of that, and\n\n71\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.510\nit's kinda small to begin with,\ncan't resize the window too much.\n\n72\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.935\nSo what I did is, and just minimize our\ntext file here for just one second,\n\n73\n00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:59.879\nwe'll come back to that in just a minute.\n\n74\n00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.183\nJust bring this down just a wee bit,\nand so what I did was I have\n\n75\n00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:10.399\nopened up an administrative\ncommand prompt as you can see.\n\n76\n00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:15.391\nAnd I have,\nthere we go that way we can get to that.\n\n77\n00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.920\nI've just opened this up on\na Windows 7 desktop, no big deal.\n\n78\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.786\nAnd you can see by the path where I am,\nlet me just backspace here for\n\n79\n00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:23.695\njust a minute.\n\n80\n00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:29.577\nYou can see that I am in the TSK,\nright, the sleuth kit directory bin.\n\n81\n00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:33.750\nI've just gone ahead and\nI've set up the sleuth kit,\n\n82\n00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.510\nI've loaded it up into,\nyou can see right here, the bin directory.\n\n83\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.300\nI've loaded it up into the C drive, so\n\n84\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.370\nyou can see it just dumped the program\nfiles for the sleuth kit into\n\n85\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.510\nthe C drive inside of the C drive or\ninside the TSK folder I created.\n\n86\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.700\nBy downloading and getting copy of the\nsleuth kit, I have all these directories.\n\n87\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.216\nAnd you'll see, I have bin,\nlib, licenses, etc.\n\n88\n00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:02.293\nSo, I'll go in the bin directory because\nwe're gonna run these commands that we're\n\n89\n00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:03.209\ngonna be demoing.\n\n90\n00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:06.140\nRunning against these programs\nthat are sitting in here.\n\n91\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.710\nThings like iCAD, HFInd, FStat,\nFLS for file list, EOI STAT, whatever.\n\n92\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.290\nThese are just all programs that\nare sitting inside of the directory.\n\n93\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.140\nYou can see them there.\n\n94\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.400\nSo, we're gonna execute\nthese programs in this path.\n\n95\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.170\nAgainst this particular set of files.\n\n96\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.505\nAnd so I've got a command line opened up\nand I've got the ability I was just in\n\n97\n00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:28.597\nthere poking around a little bit\nto make sure everything's working.\n\n98\n00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:30.730\nAnd I'm gonna walk you\nthrough some commands now.\n\n99\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.980\nSo what we'll do is just clear the screen.\n\n100\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.179\nJust so\nwe could start out right from there.\n\n101\n00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.915\nAnd what I did because you\nknow how well I type, right?\n\n102\n00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:40.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me just scroll down here for\n\n103\n00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.087\njust the second.\n\n104\n00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:42.107\n&gt;&gt; At least you own it Adam.\n\n105\n00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.652\n&gt;&gt; I do.\nI am proud of the fact that\n\n106\n00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:45.381\nI cannot type no matter how hard I try.\n\n107\n00:05:45.381 --> 00:05:48.414\nAnd so what I've done Is I've gone in and\n\n108\n00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:53.601\nI have created just all the commands\nthat I'm gonna use for the demo.\n\n109\n00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:57.958\nI've just typed them in here with\na little explanation as to what they do,\n\n110\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.740\nallowing us to see them.\n\n111\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.520\nYou could see here, we talked about\nif you remember one of prior episodes\n\n112\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.340\nall the files of the nine file types,\ntraditionally,\n\n113\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.750\nwith the dollar signs in front\nof them that we talked about,\n\n114\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.090\nwe find an NTFS partitions\nthat are important.\n\n115\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.320\nThe mirror file, the boot file,\nthe volume file, the attribute def file,\n\n116\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.310\nBITMAP, bad cluster, etc.\n\n117\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.210\nCould see them all there.\n\n118\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.950\nWe're going to show you how to find those\nusing this tool, specifically using iStat,\n\n119\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.570\none of the tools in the Sleuth tool kit.\n\n120\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.330\nAnd we're gonna issues some commands.\n\n121\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.265\nThen based on the number code we\nput at the end of the line, here,\n\n122\n00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:32.425\nit looks at each one of those files, each\none has its own number assigned to it.\n\n123\n00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:33.875\nAnd I wrote out what they are.\n\n124\n00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.489\nSo you obviously can tell what they are,\nas we go through.\n\n125\n00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:37.708\nWe're going to take a look at that.\n\n126\n00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:40.205\nWe're also going to take a look\nat another tool called FLS.\n\n127\n00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:42.665\nThe list and files,\nanother one called image stack.\n\n128\n00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:44.395\nJust check the status of the image.\n\n129\n00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:46.765\nSo we're going to go through and\nkind of use these one at a time.\n\n130\n00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:49.065\nSo let's just minimize here for a second.\n\n131\n00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:50.475\nOr actually let's do it this way.\n\n132\n00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.110\nWe'll keep that up, we'll bring this up.\n\n133\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.042\nAnd so the first one we are going to\nissue is going to be the following.\n\n134\n00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:02.673\nI stacks f for file type or\nfile system type in this case ntfs.\n\n135\n00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:06.820\nRight, so I step mine step ntfs,\na partition that we want to load,\n\n136\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.480\nso where is the image.\n\n137\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.907\nI threw just to the root of the C drive so\nwe it's easy to type and\n\n138\n00:07:10.907 --> 00:07:13.980\nthe path I'm not having to type this\nlong complicated path every time.\n\n139\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.530\nSo just departition for\ndata partition is what I named it.\n\n140\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.062\nIt's a raw image.\n\n141\n00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:20.384\nIt's DD image, so it's got DD.\n\n142\n00:07:20.384 --> 00:07:26.620\nZero's gonna allow us to be able to\nlook at the [COUGH] as you can see here.\n\n143\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.460\nJust scroll back up so\nwe can see the top here.\n\n144\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.420\nIt's gonna allow us to look at\nthe MFT entry header information.\n\n145\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.900\nSo the summary of the MFT,\nthe master file table.\n\n146\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.200\nAnd look at that and\nwe'll see here entry zero.\n\n147\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.475\nIt's gonna show us some basic information.\n\n148\n00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.151\nIt's gonna show us when it was created,\nmodified, etc,\n\n149\n00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.185\nall that kind of stuff, right.\n\n150\n00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:49.099\nIt's gonna show us when it was accessed,\nit's gonna show us the file name and\n\n151\n00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:51.825\nthe attributes and\nall the different stuff about it.\n\n152\n00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:54.428\nSo it shows us information\nthat may be valuable,\n\n153\n00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:57.102\nthat we would want to know\nas a Forensic examiner.\n\n154\n00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.261\nRight away we need to\nhave this information.\n\n155\n00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:02.797\nIt shows us the beginning of how\nwe're gonna start unwrapping it and\n\n156\n00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:06.850\nunwinding information about this\nparticular drive, this image, rather.\n\n157\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.100\nRight, so we've got that.\n\n158\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.144\nThat was zero.\n\n159\n00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:13.510\nSo now if we are gonna do this and\nwe go to number one remember\n\n160\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.250\nwhat we're looking at here is now\nwe're gonna view the MFT mirror file.\n\n161\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.340\nThat's a copy of the file we just looked\nat was zero the master file table.\n\n162\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.720\nBut it's, remember, the backup copy that's\nmade in case we have error, corruption,\n\n163\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.380\nanything like that, so that we're\ngonna be able to see what's there.\n\n164\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.850\nWe wanna compare the two, wanna make\nsure that there's no difference and\n\n165\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.310\nthat everything looks the same.\n\n166\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.000\nBecause we need to make sure that\nwe're not seeing anything unusual.\n\n167\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.869\nAnd so we could go in, and\nagain, we would see information,\n\n168\n00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:42.401\nnow it says entry: 1, right.\n\n169\n00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:46.380\nSequence: 1 instead of entry: 0 cuz we're\nlooking now the first one instead of\n\n170\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.820\nthe zero, well the second one, number one,\nbut remember we start with zero, right.\n\n171\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.450\nSo we're gonna be able to see that.\n\n172\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.260\nWe're gonna be able to see,\nagain, basic information,\n\n173\n00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.460\nlooks like it's gotta same date and\ntime stamps that hasn't change.\n\n174\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.410\nSo that's good.\n\n175\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.558\nWe're looking at mftmirror,\n\n176\n00:09:00.558 --> 00:09:03.250\nyou can see the name of the file\nthat we're parsing there.\n\n177\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.560\nSo we can see that.\n\n178\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.030\nAnd again, we're looking at attributes\nhere so we can see file name,\n\n179\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:13.520\ndata attributes, non resident, size,\nright, initialize size, and in size, etc.\n\n180\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.990\nAnd we've talked about a lot of this stuff\nand what it what it would be already.\n\n181\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.220\nSo we're able to validate all that and\n\n182\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.640\nmake sure that we are seeing information\nthat indeed does makes sense.\n\n183\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.870\nAnd then typically, and\nthere's no typical order.\n\n184\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.880\nIn other words you wouldn't necessarily\nhave to go in the order that we have these\n\n185\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.000\nset up in here.\n\n186\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.740\nI'm just doing them in a logical\norder that seems to make sense\n\n187\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.640\nas we talk about them.\n\n188\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.480\nCuz that way, we can kinda walk\nthrough the logic what's in the image,\n\n189\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.220\nexplaining as we go.\n\n190\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.720\nBut if you wanna jump right and go hey,\nyou know what I wanna see bad clusters, I\n\n191\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.040\nwanna go right to item number eight there\nand just look at the bad cluster map.\n\n192\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.680\nCuz you wanna see if there are bad\nclusters as we talked about and\n\n193\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.420\nif they're already one then go zero and\ninvestigate those.\n\n194\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.290\nThen just go that.\n\n195\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.110\nYou don't have to go\nthrough this in this order.\n\n196\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.970\nI'm just presenting you all of\nthe options we have with the iStat tool.\n\n197\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.564\nAnd I'm just going sequentially in the\nnumerical order that we see them in, so\n\n198\n00:10:00.564 --> 00:10:03.504\nthat way you can see what each one\nrepresents in terms of what file\n\n199\n00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:04.061\nit maps to.\n\n200\n00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.400\nBut you can do this\nwhatever order you want.\n\n201\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.170\nIt's up to you.\n\n202\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.490\nAll right, so we've done zero and one.\n\n203\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.700\nI didn't put zero on the list but\n\n204\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.810\nI explained zero,\nthat's just the MFT files plus in mirror.\n\n205\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.660\nLet's take a look at the boot file,\nthis will be number seven, right?\n\n206\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.300\nSo lets just go through and\njust pull this back up here.\n\n207\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.748\nAll right, so we'll do number seven,\nthe boot file.\n\n208\n00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:24.999\nAnd all we're doing, you can see,\n\n209\n00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.620\nis just literally swapping out\nthe number at the end of that.\n\n210\n00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.470\nAnd so we're just going back in and\nwe're taking a look here.\n\n211\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.687\nAnd we are looking now\nat where's number seven?\n\n212\n00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:36.720\nRight there, entry seven, right?\n\n213\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.009\nAnd so we're taking a look at and\ngoing in and seeing information about the,\n\n214\n00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:45.329\nagain just the attributes,\nthe file, right.\n\n215\n00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:48.175\nWe're taking a look at everything\nto make sure that, again,\n\n216\n00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:50.560\nwe see nothing unusual or different here.\n\n217\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.200\nWe're seeing right here the filename,\ndollar sign boot, so\n\n218\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.160\nwe're looking at the boot file right now.\n\n219\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.080\nIt is flagged as a hidden\nin the system file.\n\n220\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.100\nThat is accurate,\nthat's what we would expect.\n\n221\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.430\nWe're looking at the size,\nallocation versus actual.\n\n222\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.105\nRemember, if we look at and\nsee a difference here in the file sizes\n\n223\n00:11:07.105 --> 00:11:09.315\nthat may indicate may be hidden data,\nright?\n\n224\n00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:10.765\nSo there may be it's something going on.\n\n225\n00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:12.175\nProbably not on the boot file, right,\n\n226\n00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:14.840\nthat's probably not a place we'd spend\na lot of time trying to hide data.\n\n227\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.405\nBut in some of the files we may actually\nbe seeing differential information.\n\n228\n00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:22.585\nThere's differences and\nas a result we may see something unusual.\n\n229\n00:11:22.585 --> 00:11:24.905\nAgain, we would check for\nattributes and let's take a look and\n\n230\n00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:28.730\nsee if anything stands out and\nperhaps may be unusual here.\n\n231\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.390\nAll right, so\nthat's what the boot file would look like.\n\n232\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.970\nThat was number seven.\n\n233\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.630\nWe could take a look at the volume file,\nthe overview of the volume file.\n\n234\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.180\nWe'll load three up here.\n\n235\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.010\nLet's do that so\nI can kind of keep track of where we are.\n\n236\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.520\nSo, let's come down here.\n\n237\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.820\nLet's just go up here.\n\n238\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.470\nThank god for\nthe history cache in the DOS shell.\n\n239\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.990\nAlright so we'll load number three,\njust do that.\n\n240\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.720\nThis one is the volume file,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n241\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.010\nWe're taking a look at and\nyou can see there's some additional\n\n242\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.690\ninformation mapped out here, volume name,\nwhich we haven't seen before,\n\n243\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.640\nvolume information, which we haven't\nseen before, data information.\n\n244\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.720\nRight, so we're piecing together little\npieces of the puzzle, as we go, right.\n\n245\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.020\nJust kinda zero it on this cuz the other\nstuff's really just the same every time.\n\n246\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.850\nBut we can see that we do have\nsome information specifically\n\n247\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.385\nabout the volume name, if there is one,\nwe don't have a volume name.\n\n248\n00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:23.736\nBut if this particular partition had\na volume name, we will see it there.\n\n249\n00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:26.681\nSo it'd be good to know because the volume\nname, may or may not tell us something,\n\n250\n00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:27.405\nit's hard to say.\n\n251\n00:12:27.405 --> 00:12:29.895\nI don't tend to give volumes\nname when I name them, or\n\n252\n00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:32.715\nrather when I create them, but\nthat doesn't mean you wouldn't.\n\n253\n00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:33.665\nVery often you do and\n\n254\n00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:37.895\na lot of times we have a standard as\na naming convention in an organization.\n\n255\n00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:40.901\nThe volume name in theory would be named a\ncertain way base on the information that's\n\n256\n00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:41.463\nstored there.\n\n257\n00:12:41.463 --> 00:12:44.595\nAnd that would probably be useful to know\nand something we'd wanna be aware of.\n\n258\n00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:46.850\nSo we wanna take note of that.\n\n259\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.610\nLet's look at the attribute\ndefinition file, number four.\n\n260\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.270\nSo we'll go in and we'll take a look at\nthat, again just up arrow and do this.\n\n261\n00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.500\nNow keep in mind, we are keeping track,\nand the reason we would create a file like\n\n262\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.330\nthe one I have with all the commands\nas we do the investigation,\n\n263\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.490\nwe'd wanna have a methodological thought\nprocess, and an ordered thought process.\n\n264\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.342\nEven if we go in random order,\nwhatever we're doing,\n\n265\n00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:11.194\nan order it in the way which\nwe're examining the data,\n\n266\n00:13:11.194 --> 00:13:14.557\nthe methodology that makes sense to us,\nand we wanna note that.\n\n267\n00:13:14.557 --> 00:13:17.608\nBecause every step that we take should\nbe noted as part of the notes of\n\n268\n00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:18.830\nthe investigation.\n\n269\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.280\nSo when we find something unusual, we stop\nat that point and go, wow look at that.\n\n270\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.780\nVolume label says,\n\n271\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.190\nMastermind Plan to Blow Up the World\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.960\n&gt;&gt; And, yeah, we found\n\n273\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.777\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n274\n00:13:27.777 --> 00:13:29.059\nOr-\n&gt;&gt; The smoking gun.\n\n275\n00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:29.799\nYeah.\n\n276\n00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:30.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Account Hack 5, whatever.\n\n277\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.434\nSo we wanna know that, we have to say,\nokay, in step four, at this day and time,\n\n278\n00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:36.459\nin this particular part\nis where I found this.\n\n279\n00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:40.000\nWe have to be able to document all that,\nand really know what that is.\n\n280\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.590\nSo wanna make sure we're keeping track\nof all that, have that in our minds.\n\n281\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.630\nSo number four here,\nwe're taking a look at this.\n\n282\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.370\nIn this case the attribute definition,\nso just come down here.\n\n283\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.920\nWe can see if there's any information,\nanything that maybe of interest to you.\n\n284\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.680\nAgain, notice we don't have a volume label\nhere because we did the volume one and\n\n285\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.470\nthe prior one.\n\n286\n00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.600\nSo the types will change here.\n\n287\n00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.410\nWe're looking at types, we're looking\nat size, we're looking at information\n\n288\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.420\nthat may or may not be important to us,\nthat may or may not be present.\n\n289\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.930\nWe're just looking for things that stand\nout as being unusual, as I pointed out.\n\n290\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.080\nAs we do this kind of review, so\n\n291\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.630\nwe've dubbed the ATTrDef, let's look\nat the bit map file, number six.\n\n292\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.440\nScroll up here, do this and\nyour dollar sign bit map.\n\n293\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.133\nWe're just walking through every one\nof the files that we talked about,\n\n294\n00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:31.570\njust looking at information.\n\n295\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.430\nAgain, when do create it, things like\nthat, but you'll notice here that we have,\n\n296\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.020\nfor initsize, the initial size,\nwe have different sizes here, right?\n\n297\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.736\nUnlike some of the others we've seen,\n\n298\n00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.880\nwhere it's traditionally just been one or\ntwo.\n\n299\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.728\nAnd that gives us more information about\nsome information that may pertain to\n\n300\n00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:53.652\neither file sizes or information about\npartition sizes or things that we may or\n\n301\n00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:56.330\nmay not want to know about on the drive.\n\n302\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.208\nAnd so we're looking for\ninformation, of a variety of types.\n\n303\n00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:02.494\nThere's different things that we may\nbe going through and wanting to find.\n\n304\n00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:05.780\nThe bad cluster file one, that we often,\nas I said, want to take a look at.\n\n305\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.880\nWe'll take a look at that one, and\nthen we'll look at the MFT file overview,\n\n306\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.030\njust the overarching information as well.\n\n307\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.410\nBut bad cluster is number eight.\n\n308\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:14.710\nLet's go in and take a look at that.\n\n309\n00:15:16.877 --> 00:15:20.698\nAll right, so\nwe have bad clust right here.\n\n310\n00:15:20.698 --> 00:15:23.220\nRight, and so we'll see here,\n\n311\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.880\nit doesn't look like we have any bad\nclusters, there's nothing in there.\n\n312\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.336\nBut if we did this will be a gold mine for\nus.\n\n313\n00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.850\nCuz this would be one of\nthe places we wanna look and\n\n314\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.100\nsee if there's any information that may or\nmay not be of value.\n\n315\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.510\nLook at number nine,\nnumber nine gives us the overview.\n\n316\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.095\nGot a lot of stuff there\nwith the nit sizes, right,\n\n317\n00:15:40.095 --> 00:15:41.296\nthat's gonna be helpful for us.\n\n318\n00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:45.967\nGot index route information,\nlooking at what indexes are there.\n\n319\n00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.390\nWe've got the bitmap,\ntells us dollar sign bitmap.\n\n320\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.582\nWhat areas and what kind of\ninformation we're looking for.\n\n321\n00:15:52.582 --> 00:15:55.932\nThis would be a file that we would parse,\nprobably first or very close to first,\n\n322\n00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:59.332\ncuz it would lay out some information\nabout the other files we've already backed\n\n323\n00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:00.192\ninto and looked at.\n\n324\n00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.851\nWe're just doing it kind\nof in reverse order so\n\n325\n00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:03.775\nyou can see this one after\nwe've seen all the others.\n\n326\n00:16:03.775 --> 00:16:05.227\nBut it would give us information.\n\n327\n00:16:05.227 --> 00:16:07.447\nSay yeah,\nthe bitmap file is at this location,\n\n328\n00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:10.100\nhas this kind of information\nassociated with it.\n\n329\n00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.810\nBut you could see here we can\nlook at this information and\n\n330\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.370\nwe can see if there's a lot of stuff\nthat may be of value of to us.\n\n331\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.070\nAgain, and just knowing what is there and\n\n332\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.750\nthis kind of information begins to lay out\nfor us, a road map that we would look at.\n\n333\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.310\nSo just going and\ncontinuing to hack away at, and\n\n334\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.230\nuse the istat tool as we've been doing.\n\n335\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.390\nGives us quite a bit of information.\n\n336\n00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.640\nWe can also switch over and\nwe can look at FLS.\n\n337\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.080\nJust a file listing and\nyou can see some quick commands there.\n\n338\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.660\nFile listing, file system, mtfs.\n\n339\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.410\nWe're gonna take a look there and we're\ngonna see all the files and directories.\n\n340\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.520\nThe D switch will give\nus the deleted ones,\n\n341\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.700\nthe ones that have been deleted\nthat we may want to see.\n\n342\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.590\nSo let's just take a look at\nthe difference with those two.\n\n343\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.398\nWe will go ahead and type this in.\n\n344\n00:16:54.398 --> 00:17:02.200\nAlright so F-L-S.\n\n345\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.120\nAnd we're gonna type in, we'll do\nour -f first for file system type.\n\n346\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.230\nAnd we'll see a list of all the files,\ndirectories there, for NTFS.\n\n347\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.650\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n348\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.450\nWe'll do our, what was it?\n\n349\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.480\nOur departition.\n\n350\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.520\nOf course, I started out\ntyping f instead of d, right?\n\n351\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.325\nThis is the reason that I don't type.\n\n352\n00:17:22.325 --> 00:17:27.434\nDpartitionrawimage.dd, right, okay.\n\n353\n00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:31.918\nAll right, so when we do that,\n\n354\n00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:38.480\njust move this back over for\njust a moment.\n\n355\n00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.810\nWe would probably actually if we didn't\nknow these files were already there.\n\n356\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.510\nWe know because it's NTFS right?\n\n357\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.430\nWe know the file types we would look for.\n\n358\n00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.110\nSo what we just did with ISTAT is a direct\nresult of us knowing we have an NTFS\n\n359\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.840\npartition and knowing those files those\nnine file types are going to be there so\n\n360\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.860\nwe can parse them.\n\n361\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.730\nBut if we didn't know that, we would start\nout by figuring out what kind of partition\n\n362\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.530\nwe have, what file system is there.\n\n363\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.030\nThen we would do a list to\nsee what files a resident and\n\n364\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.560\nwe could see [INAUDIBLE] That cluster,\nbit map, right boot, extend, log file.\n\n365\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.940\nRight all sort of stuff we went\nthrough most of these already.\n\n366\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.680\nThere's recycle bin we gonna look at\nthat one, right see what's there.\n\n367\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.520\nThere are, the security files that we\njust looked at, upper case, volumes,\n\n368\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.530\nselected volumes, raw files, etcetera.\n\n369\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.380\nRight, so we see all of these different\nkind of stuff that we may want to look at.\n\n370\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:30.530\nSo, listing this information helps us with\nthe list command, right, or essentially\n\n371\n00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.300\nlisting the directories and the files,\nhelps us to see what's on the drive.\n\n372\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.790\nThis is literally like going in and just\nopening up a Windows Explorer looking at\n\n373\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.200\nthe root and\nlooking at all the files that are there.\n\n374\n00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.340\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n375\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.540\nBut if we wanna see deleted files, right.\n\n376\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.098\nWe'll go in and we'll change this and\nwell put in a D instead of an F.\n\n377\n00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:54.180\nAll right, and then if there is.\n\n378\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.680\nOne second, no that's fine.\n\n379\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.560\nYeah there's nothing there\nbecause we don't have,\n\n380\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.780\nnot such file directory, right?\n\n381\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.720\nSo we don't have anything there,\nthere's no deleted files,\n\n382\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.370\nthat's why we're getting an error back\nsaying It's just not finding anything.\n\n383\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.510\nAnd it's not able to look and\nsee that there is anything.\n\n384\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.920\nBut we would see that there\nare no deleted files.\n\n385\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.500\nThere maybe.\n\n386\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This image I don't have any.\n\n387\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.580\nBut if I had them I would be able to see\nthem and or to work with them right.\n\n388\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.790\nSo I could pull up.\n\n389\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.010\nDeleted files as well.\n\n390\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.690\n&gt;&gt; I actually really like\nthe output of this tool.\n\n391\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.680\nBecause it,\nit kind of is very familiar to all of us.\n\n392\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.390\nIt's not some even though graphical\noutputs are nice with the hierarchical\n\n393\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.800\ntrees and, and things of that nature,\nI'm so used to that Unix black box or even\n\n394\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.230\njumping into Windows and searching through\nthe command line or the Power Shell.\n\n395\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.000\nAnd seeing that type of format it\njust makes it so much easier for\n\n396\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.410\nme to be able to take a look.\n\n397\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.980\nAnd see, yeah there's some directories.\n\n398\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.100\nThere are some files in here and\nI'm very familiar with it.\n\n399\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well yeah.\n\n400\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.740\nSo it's.\nSure if you are used to that environment\n\n401\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.990\nabsolutely right it gives you that\ncapability and makes you comfort.\n\n402\n00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So absolutely.\n\n403\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.490\nSo I just issued the other command here.\n\n404\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.250\nJust a quick one.\n\n405\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.810\nThis is one we would often do\nright at the beginning as well.\n\n406\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.800\nImage stacked, just another one\nof the tools that's in there.\n\n407\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.210\nJust image file information, what type\nof images, if raw type, how big is it?\n\n408\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.660\nWant to see the overall size,\nimage status is just hey,\n\n409\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.560\nlet me get the properties essentially,\ntell me the type and the size.\n\n410\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.280\nRight, so we can use a variety\nof tools in the sleuth tool kit,\n\n411\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.030\nyou've seen several of them deployed\nhere for us to be able to view and\n\n412\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.470\ninteract with a, in this case, a drive\nimage or potentially sound image, right?\n\n413\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:28.210\nAnd this is very similar, as we said,\nto what we could be doing,\n\n414\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.790\nif we went in here and\nwe went to our Win hex.\n\n415\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.490\nRight editor and looked at the image.\n\n416\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.440\nRemember we are not looking at necessarily\nthose files in the same we are looking at\n\n417\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.310\nthe actual data.\n\n418\n00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:46.210\nIt's just another image, just another\nrole image right here that I loaded and\n\n419\n00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.000\nwould show us the data and allow us\nto interact within different ways.\n\n420\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.710\nThen we are saying, it may be like\nthe output of the command line\n\n421\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.120\nmay be prefer the output\nof graphical icon.\n\n422\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.260\nI don't know, either way.\n\n423\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.710\nThe idea would be that we can certainly\ndo that, interact with that and\n\n424\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.240\nhave the ability to go in and\nto use this tool here.\n\n425\n00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.530\nNow, one other thing that we can do,\njust go back here to this environment for\n\n426\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.220\njust a moment.\n\n427\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:14.880\nBring up another box for us, this may or\nmay not look familiar, this is Kali Linux.\n\n428\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.913\nAnd we just log in here real quick.\n\n429\n00:21:19.672 --> 00:21:22.650\nAnd so\nI'm running the autopsy forensic browser.\n\n430\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.680\nThis is an older version of the browser.\n\n431\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.330\nIt maybe hard to see.\n\n432\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.010\nIt's kind of dark.\n\n433\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.310\nBut we have a command line\nterminal up here, and\n\n434\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.190\nyou can see that, when I launched it.\n\n435\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.130\nAnd I'll show you how we launched it.\n\n436\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.310\nSo I go over here to my little\nshow application browser.\n\n437\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.230\nThe old fashioned days of not having\na GUI and having to navigate.\n\n438\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.290\nThey've made Lenox so\neasy, you point and click.\n\n439\n00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.040\n&gt;&gt; They did.\n&gt;&gt; It's like Lenox with training wheels.\n\n440\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.300\n&gt;&gt; They want more people\nto get involved with it.\n\n441\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.073\n&gt;&gt; They do, they do.\n\n442\n00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:48.700\nSo we go in, we do the browser here.\n\n443\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.090\nIf you haven't seen Cali recently or\nare used Used to using, as Daniel said.\n\n444\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.060\nMaybe an older version, or even a new\nversion, but just with a terminal and or\n\n445\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.932\njust a non-graphical point and click\nenvironment cuz you may not use a shell.\n\n446\n00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:02.350\nYou maybe more familiar with and\njust comfortable in a terminal.\n\n447\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.360\nYou may not be using it this way,\nso you may not have seen it.\n\n448\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.860\nBut we have the ability now to go out,\nmuch like a Windows desktop or\n\n449\n00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.870\na Mac desktop, and graphically browse.\n\n450\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.310\nSo it does come in handy.\n\n451\n00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.700\nIn Cali, which is really a distribution\nof Linux designed for security and\n\n452\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.456\nforensics, we have many tool sets.\n\n453\n00:22:18.456 --> 00:22:22.535\nYou can see them broken out here by\ncategory, vulnerability, web apps,\n\n454\n00:22:22.535 --> 00:22:26.395\nDatabases, Passwords,\nExploits, things like that.\n\n455\n00:22:26.395 --> 00:22:29.625\nNumber 11 happens to be Forensics,\nwhere we're going to go, and\n\n456\n00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:31.175\nwe'll be in and\nout of here from time to time.\n\n457\n00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:35.027\nSecurity tools Set, the set of tools\nright here for a variety of things.\n\n458\n00:22:35.027 --> 00:22:36.567\nMainly hacking, primarily,\n\n459\n00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:38.707\nI'm sure you're probably come out\nwith some of these sometimes.\n\n460\n00:22:38.707 --> 00:22:39.817\n&gt;&gt; It's doing all sorts of stuff.\n\n461\n00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:40.997\n&gt;&gt; Once or twice in my life.\n\n462\n00:22:40.997 --> 00:22:45.407\n&gt;&gt; Metasploit for instance, reverse\nengineering, wireless, all sorts of stuff.\n\n463\n00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:47.257\nSo in the forensics area,\njust go in there.\n\n464\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.190\nClick we do get a listing of all the tools\nand there are quite a number of them in\n\n465\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.850\nhere, black cat, right autopsy which I\nam going to show you in just a second,\n\n466\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.970\nthat's how I launched it, it's running,\nit opens in a terminal window,\n\n467\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.220\ngives you a URL, you then either.\n\n468\n00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.950\nThere's an option that pops up hey\nessentially load in the browser or\n\n469\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.980\nyou could copy it and\njust drop it into the browser,\n\n470\n00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.260\neither way, but\nit prompts you to open it up.\n\n471\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.060\nThe trick is you've got to leave the.\n\n472\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.782\nTerminal window open or you kill autopsy\nand the browser session doesn't work.\n\n473\n00:23:15.782 --> 00:23:16.630\n[LAUGH].\nSo you gotta do that.\n\n474\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.440\nSo you just know you can do that.\n\n475\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.500\nBut we have DD rescue, so we can use\nthe DD tool to be able to go in and\n\n476\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.750\nlook at images and recover data.\n\n477\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.440\nThere's all sorts of stuff in here, right.\n\n478\n00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.940\nSo we're going to focus on just for\na minute the autopsy tool.\n\n479\n00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.030\nSo this is how I launched it.\n\n480\n00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:37.030\nSo once I've done that then what I\ndid was, let's just come back here.\n\n481\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.460\nOops, let's come back here one more time,\nthere we go.\n\n482\n00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.810\nAnd so you'll see I just have the terminal\nsession and it says specifically, hey,\n\n483\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.138\nkeep this process running and you just\nControl + C when you're ready to exit.\n\n484\n00:23:49.138 --> 00:23:51.540\nYou don't wanna exit Until you're ready,\nright?\n\n485\n00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.536\nSo you go in and you load this.\n\n486\n00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:57.835\nYou could see it's running on the local\nhost port 9999 forward slash right?\n\n487\n00:23:57.835 --> 00:24:01.862\nSo I'm just gonna show you what this looks\nlike, so give me a second here because I\n\n488\n00:24:01.862 --> 00:24:04.706\nhave to come up with This\nunique keystroke combination,\n\n489\n00:24:04.706 --> 00:24:08.125\nthanks to the manufacturer of Apple,\nto be able to do this, right?\n\n490\n00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:12.020\n[LAUGH] All right, and so we're just\ngonna go to the IceWeasel browser and\n\n491\n00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.910\nwhen I clicked on that link,\nI load up Autopsy.\n\n492\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.440\nNow, this is a slightly older\nversion of Autopsy running in Linux.\n\n493\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.480\nI'm gonna show you a newer\nversion on Windows in a minute.\n\n494\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.020\nJust ported.\n\n495\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.010\nIt's essentially the same tool.\n\n496\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.210\nDoesn't matter what it looks like.\n\n497\n00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.300\nBut you'll see here we could go in\nCreate a new case, Open an existing one.\n\n498\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.040\nAutopsy is a case management\ntool a la In Case,\n\n499\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.990\na la Paradin that we've already looked\nat in some of the other shows, right?\n\n500\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.100\nSo we would go in just to show you what\nthis looks like on the surface here.\n\n501\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.250\nGive this a case name.\n\n502\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:45.209\nCall this ITProTV Case.\n\n503\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.310\nHDD1 for you know hard drive one or\n\n504\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.120\nsomething, describes you know\nadd a description there.\n\n505\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.600\nWho are the investigators, right?\n\n506\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.490\nSo we'll put Daniel in there and\nput me in there.\n\n507\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.920\nSo we have multiple investigators.\n\n508\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.445\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget Taylor.\n\n509\n00:24:58.445 --> 00:24:59.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could,\n\n510\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.220\nthat's right we should put Taylor in\nthere too, I didn't think about that.\n\n511\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.980\n&gt;&gt; He's part of the show.\n\n512\n00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.110\n&gt;&gt; He is.\n\n513\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.160\nAnd integral part of our\ncase management team.\n\n514\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.090\nSo, we're gonna wait just a second\nthere it's just gonna load up.\n\n515\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.520\nNo, I don't wanna clean up.\n\n516\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.354\nYeah, I don't care about that.\n\n517\n00:25:14.354 --> 00:25:18.210\nLet's just do refresh because it's\nprobably just gonna sit there and hang.\n\n518\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.040\nSo just do that real quick, one second.\n\n519\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.030\nLooks like Ice Weasel is asking me\nif I wanna go ahead and update it.\n\n520\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.360\nSo let me just finish that real quick and\ndo a refresh.\n\n521\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.130\nHere we go.\n\n522\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.061\n&gt;&gt; You're proving a very security-minded\nsound practice of updating\n\n523\n00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:39.690\nyour software [LAUGH].\n\n524\n00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right restore all windows and\ntabs, yes.\n\n525\n00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.700\nOkay, so we'll just bring that back in.\n\n526\n00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.000\nOkay, we didn't, okay that's why\nlet me just go back one second.\n\n527\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.810\nLooks like it didn't like something there,\nokay yes.\n\n528\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.720\nLet's do ITProTV.\n\n529\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.970\nLet's do [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n530\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.644\ncenter that real quick for\n\n531\n00:26:05.644 --> 00:26:09.900\nus just so we can see it.\n\n532\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.410\nLet's do Daniel, let's do me\n\n533\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:21.510\nbecause I'm already in there and this time\nwe're going to add Mr. Taylor in there.\n\n534\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.110\nThere we go.\nAll right,\n\n535\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.680\nso let's just scroll down right there,\nget to the bottom.\n\n536\n00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.440\nThere we go, new case.\n\n537\n00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.220\nAll right, there we go.\n\n538\n00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.810\nAll right, so we created that and\nwe got our case directory.\n\n539\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.370\nSo it shows us where the case\nis going to be stored.\n\n540\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.931\nbar lib autopsy the autopsy directory.\n\n541\n00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:41.720\nCreate a subdirectory called\nwhatever the case name is.\n\n542\n00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.380\nAnd then the config file, inside there,\ncase.aut, that's the config file for\n\n543\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.670\nautopsy .aut is the extension.\n\n544\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.950\nFor that we now create a host.\n\n545\n00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.630\nOr we must now create a host for the case.\n\n546\n00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.080\nSo please select your name\nfrom the field there.\n\n547\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.190\nSo which one of the investigators\nis gonna do this?\n\n548\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.200\nSo I'm gonna be Taylor.\n\n549\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Gonna add a host, all right.\n\n550\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.750\nAnd then we gotta specify our host name,\nso whatever the host name is, the name of\n\n551\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.140\nthe computer being investigated is\nthe host by the way, just so you know.\n\n552\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.436\nSo if this was, I don't know,\nproduction one or something.\n\n553\n00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:17.147\nWhatever the name would be,\nI would give it a name, so\n\n554\n00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:21.776\ninstead of host one,\nlet's call this accounting.\n\n555\n00:27:24.762 --> 00:27:26.640\nCuz maybe it's the accounting machine.\n\n556\n00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.288\nA little description,\nwhat time zone are we there gonna be in,\n\n557\n00:27:30.288 --> 00:27:32.340\nis there a time scheme adjustment.\n\n558\n00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.850\nRight for that whatever that will be.\n\n559\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.310\nPath of the allure hash database,\nif we know that.\n\n560\n00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.010\nOptional if you wanna\nspecify that ahead of time.\n\n561\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.140\nAll right, so add the host.\n\n562\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.963\nAdding the host we did that\nnot too difficult to do,\n\n563\n00:27:48.963 --> 00:27:51.436\nwe now have to import an image,\nto go out image.\n\n564\n00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:54.005\nWe have to bring it on our image file\nyou see me do this before and so\n\n565\n00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:57.040\nthen we will actually get the interface\nto be able to work with it.\n\n566\n00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.340\nLet's look at what Autopsy\nlooks like on the Windows side.\n\n567\n00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.590\nA little bit different, but\n\n568\n00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.240\njust again to show you the tools to\nget you to start to think about them.\n\n569\n00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.580\nSo I'm going to minimize out of here for\na minute.\n\n570\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.570\nI have to remote in.\n\n571\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.850\n&gt;&gt; We are fair and balanced, right?.\n\n572\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.514\n&gt;&gt; We are fair and balanced.\n\n573\n00:28:08.514 --> 00:28:10.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going to remote in\n\n574\n00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:13.440\nto the Windows 12 box\nwhere I have that running.\n\n575\n00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.934\nSo let me just load up a terminal\nsession and that's 101201.\n\n576\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.190\nLet me just do that, 101.201.\n\n577\n00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.488\nSo that's remoting in there,\nour Autopsy Version four in Windows,\n\n578\n00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:30.785\na little bit of a different one,\ngot our logo there as you could see but\n\n579\n00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:32.210\ninstead of\n&gt;&gt; Much cooler\n\n580\n00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, much cooler,\n\n581\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.240\nmuch more bad as we say, instead of\nthe droopy dog when you open it up.\n\n582\n00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.540\nRight we've got the-\n&gt;&gt; The Doberman.\n\n583\n00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.150\n&gt;&gt; The Doberman guarding\nthe little spyglass there.\n\n584\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.650\nAll right, so you've seen,\nI may have thrown this up in other shows.\n\n585\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.680\nIt may not have been one that we\nspend a lot of time on right now.\n\n586\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.950\nBut just to give you a sense what\nit looks like in Windows, Autopsy.\n\n587\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.100\nSo again, create new case,\nopen recent case.\n\n588\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.660\nLet's just look at what creating\na new case would look like here.\n\n589\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.270\nSame concept, but\nthe interface is a little bit different.\n\n590\n00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.340\nJust move this over here,\nso you can see it.\n\n591\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.877\nCase name, so again,\nI would do something like,\n\n592\n00:29:06.877 --> 00:29:11.749\nIT Pro, maybe TV and\nlet me call this six or whatever.\n\n593\n00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:14.130\nAnd then a path where\nwe're gonna create it.\n\n594\n00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.750\nSo, it'll do that for us.\n\n595\n00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.490\nAdditional information,\ncase number and examiner, so\n\n596\n00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.460\nI put in Mr. Taylor there.\n\n597\n00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:31.340\nSo do that and then once we done that\nit takes it just a second to spin up.\n\n598\n00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.570\nIt's gonna give us\nthe ability here to go in and\n\n599\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.620\nonce we've done that,\nwe'll then be able to add our data source.\n\n600\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.080\nPull in our image just\na click of a button,\n\n601\n00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.910\njust like it would have been in the Linux\nbox going out pathing to find it.\n\n602\n00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.210\nWe'll be able to go in and do that.\n\n603\n00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.220\nYou can see right up here, we can add\nour data source once we're ready.\n\n604\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.910\nAnd then we can go in and\nstart working with it.\n\n605\n00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.160\nAnd there's a little wizard\nto add our data source.\n\n606\n00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.830\nJust move this over so\nyou can guys can see the edge of that.\n\n607\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.650\nSo we would go in and specify what\nkind of file, image file, local disc,\n\n608\n00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.060\nlogical disc, you know,\nwhatever it is that we want to do.\n\n609\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.380\nIf we have an image file, right,\nspecify for the image file.\n\n610\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.720\nWhere are we going to go.\n\n611\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.810\nRight so we can go out and\nbrowse and find that.\n\n612\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.380\nThere is the device image, so if I want to\nuse the Mobile one with the device image\n\n613\n00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.150\nthat I have, that we will see later on.\n\n614\n00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.916\nFor the mobile forensic show I can bring\nthat in if that is what I wanna do.\n\n615\n00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:21.430\nWhich is the demo that I do there,\nso actually see that but\n\n616\n00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.160\nI will just use it just you\ncould see the walk through here.\n\n617\n00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.920\nI could ignore often file or fend\nthe file in the fat systems if I want to.\n\n618\n00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.290\nOr bring them in.\n\n619\n00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.180\nJust a wee-bit more, so you can see that.\n\n620\n00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.300\nOr actually know what we can do,\nwe can do the local disk as well.\n\n621\n00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.810\nLet's just do the local disk and\nselect a local drive here.\n\n622\n00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:44.220\nSo, let's go in and let's do the local\ndisk cuz you haven't seen me do that one.\n\n623\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:44.810\nSo, we'll do that.\n\n624\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.090\nWe specify our input time zones,\nyou know, where are we.\n\n625\n00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.830\nJust like we were ask to in the other one.\n\n626\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.840\nClick Next.\n\n627\n00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.530\nYou specify what kind of files we may be\nlooking for, what modules, ingest modules,\n\n628\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.640\nthings we wanna use, parsers,\nto look for information.\n\n629\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.500\nSo things like a keyword search,\nwhat are we looking for?\n\n630\n00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.790\nPhone numbers, IP addresses,\nrecent activity, hash lookup,\n\n631\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.070\nfile type identification.\n\n632\n00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.020\nEmbedded file extractors, some of these\nwill have options, some will not.\n\n633\n00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.620\nSo we specify what we want there.\n\n634\n00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.690\nClick Next, it's adding in.\n\n635\n00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.890\nNow, this will take awhile cuz it's\nparsing the entire local drive.\n\n636\n00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.600\nWe're not gonna wait for\nthis whole thing to finish.\n\n637\n00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.800\nBut the idea is that I could add in,\nand do the analysis,\n\n638\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.610\nessentially on the fly\nas I'm loading the data.\n\n639\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.811\nIf it's an image file, it just loads the\nimage and obviously parses the image and\n\n640\n00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:32.680\nit does the same doing here.\n\n641\n00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.120\nI'm just bringing in a local hard drive or\n\n642\n00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.470\na hard drive on the machine\nwhatever it maybe.\n\n643\n00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.942\nAnd you could see it's just adding and\n\n644\n00:31:38.942 --> 00:31:40.744\nwalking through the Windows\nfile structure.\n\n645\n00:31:40.744 --> 00:31:44.400\nIt's gonna add them all in and once\nit's finished, it's actually complete.\n\n646\n00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.530\nWe would then get a complete\ngraphical interface,\n\n647\n00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.160\nwe're gonna be able to go in and interact.\n\n648\n00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.770\nAnd be able to see and browse and\nlook for files and things like that.\n\n649\n00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:58.438\nAnd if you for the magic modern\nmagic here at ITProTV of time lapse.\n\n650\n00:31:58.438 --> 00:32:00.567\nWe can go ahead and let this run.\n\n651\n00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:01.542\nAnd then, if you come back and\n\n652\n00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:03.414\njoin us in just a moment we'll\nactually see a complete and\n\n653\n00:32:03.414 --> 00:32:05.099\nI'll just show you what\nthe interface looks like.\n\n654\n00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:07.789\nAs soon as it finishes up, okay.\n\n655\n00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:11.507\nAll right so, we are done adding in the\nimage files so we'll take a look at rather\n\n656\n00:32:11.507 --> 00:32:14.740\njust the data from the local\nhard drive as you can see here.\n\n657\n00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.200\nSo, we'll actually just take a look.\n\n658\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.590\nIt's kind of added the data source,\nlet me just move this over so\n\n659\n00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.150\nyou can see where we are.\n\n660\n00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.160\nSo we've done that.\n\n661\n00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.100\nAnd sees that a new data source has\nbeen added, files are being analyzed,\n\n662\n00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.100\nso the analysis if you go full screen for\nme for just a minute, just so\n\n663\n00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.226\nwe can see the analysis is\nstarting to happen right now.\n\n664\n00:32:29.226 --> 00:32:31.400\nThat is going to take a while, so\n\n665\n00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.200\nwhen we load up you kind of already see\nthe interface behind me is populated,\n\n666\n00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.650\nbut the data itself will not be\navailable for some time yet,\n\n667\n00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.750\nparsing 100 GB of data into a tool\nlike this, just loading the files\n\n668\n00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.470\ntakes a few minutes, but then actually\ngoing through and trying to analyze them.\n\n669\n00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.540\nWe're on zero percent right now,\nit's going to take quite a while.\n\n670\n00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.550\nWe're not going to wait for\nthat to happen.\n\n671\n00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.570\nThat is something we would sit around\nliterally, and then go off and\n\n672\n00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.470\ndo some other stuff and then come back to.\n\n673\n00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:04.060\nBut loading it up doesn't take too long,\nwe'll click finish, and we can see that\n\n674\n00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.580\nthe data is now going to start here\ntrickling in little by little over time.\n\n675\n00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.400\nAnd the interface here\nwill start to populate.\n\n676\n00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.800\nI've already got some user accounts here.\n\n677\n00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.680\nI've already got some\nrecent documents populated.\n\n678\n00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.090\nLooks like I've got some web cookies,\nweb downloads, web history.\n\n679\n00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.500\nYou got 7,000, almost 8,000 items\nin the web history already.\n\n680\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.860\nSo it's clearly getting\na bunch of data in there.\n\n681\n00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.010\nAnd it's literally on zero percent\nright now at the bottom on the bar.\n\n682\n00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.730\nIt's done almost nothing, it's already\npopulated quite a bit of stuff.\n\n683\n00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.450\nBut the problem is, of course,\nas I go in and start to look, well,\n\n684\n00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.110\nI can see some data, and\nI certainly could see this populating.\n\n685\n00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.230\nIt's just going through right there and\nsaying there's a bunch of stuff.\n\n686\n00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.210\nAnd it's finding a bunch\nof different items here,\n\n687\n00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.460\nwhatever the case maybe, right?\n\n688\n00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.080\nBut when we go in and we start looking\ngo to web history here, just click for\n\n689\n00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.996\na second,\nit's going to take a moment to load.\n\n690\n00:33:53.996 --> 00:33:57.790\nWe're not going to get access to a lot of\nthe data, yet, until we actually go in and\n\n691\n00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.950\neverything is actually complete.\n\n692\n00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:03.180\nSo, we have Google there, right,\nyou know, we have just a bunch of stuff.\n\n693\n00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.910\nWhen we go in and maybe highlight one,\nwe can certainly see Google,\n\n694\n00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.040\nwhen it was accessed, things like that,\non the local hard drive.\n\n695\n00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.520\nWe could see information about it.\n\n696\n00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.090\nThere's Chrome right there.\n\n697\n00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.620\nIt just tells us what it is.\n\n698\n00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.750\nThere may or may not be a thumbnail\nassociated with this, but the reality is,\n\n699\n00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.380\nas we generate more data, we'll be able to\nstart to see more files, so pretty cool.\n\n700\n00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.160\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, we love watching these\ndemonstrations of these awesome tools.\n\n701\n00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.890\nAutopsy no exception to that,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n702\n00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:32.920\nGo out and learn how to use\neach one of these things so\n\n703\n00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.370\nthat you can also do a forensics\ninvestigation on your own.\n\n704\n00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.270\nHave a good time learning\nhow to do this stuff.\n\n705\n00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.010\nSo you're just going to\nanswer questions accordingly.\n\n706\n00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.170\nWith that being said it looks like\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n707\n00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.730\nFor IT pro tv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n708\n00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.490\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n709\n00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.387\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n710\n00:34:47.387 --> 00:34:54.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n711\n00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:57.086\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:13.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.940\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.490\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.350\nmore on our CHFI Version nine series,\nthat's right, with more versioning.\n\n7\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.320\nJoining us in the studio yet again to\ncontinue our look at what is different,\n\n8\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.710\nand what we need to expect to know in that\ntest, our good friend mister Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.080\nAdam, we're glad to have you back,\nand how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.840\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well,\nenjoying the weather.\n\n11\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.475\nAs hopefully.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:39.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All of you are.\n\n13\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.290\nSo, we got a little bit of rain here\nas we've been going through getting\n\n14\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.050\nready for the show.\n\n15\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.080\nSo, we've just been talking about\nthe value of rain and why it is so\n\n16\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.500\nimportant to the CHFI professional.\n\n17\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So, you can do your job while wet and\n\n18\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.090\ndry the same way.\n\n19\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.840\nAll right, so, without further adieu,\nlet us talk about data acquisition.\n\n20\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.850\nAnd the ability to be able to\nlook at duplication of that.\n\n21\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.010\nIn other words, how do we get our data?\n\n22\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.360\nHow do we make a forensically\nsound copy of the data?\n\n23\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.150\nThese are things that\nwe've been talking about.\n\n24\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.840\nPrior episodes have certainly gone\nthrough the methodology around\n\n25\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.790\nwhy these particular skills are important.\n\n26\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.720\nWe've shown you some tools where we've\nmounted drive images to examine data.\n\n27\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990\nSo certainly we've been using\nthe output of these skills.\n\n28\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810\nAnd we've talked about\nthe different kinds of data.\n\n29\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.460\nstatic or what we call non volatile data.\n\n30\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.230\nDynamic or live or volatile data, we've\nheard it referred to in different ways.\n\n31\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.900\nSo we've certainly been thinking\nthrough the logic of this,\n\n32\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.020\nwe've talked about the order\nof volatility of data before.\n\n33\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.320\nWe'll put that back up on the screen,\njust a minute, walk you through that.\n\n34\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.960\nTalk about the live data collection\nmethodology, the steps involved and\n\n35\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.060\nthe detailed steps that\nwe actually execute on.\n\n36\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.800\nSome of the do's and don'ts there.\n\n37\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.430\nBut before we do any of that,\nwe should probably start by talking about\n\n38\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.200\nthe definition of what data acquisition\nmeans theoretically, logically, and\n\n39\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990\nactually as we engage in that activity.\n\n40\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.400\nSo as I always try to do, we'll\nincorporate Daniel here, cause he does\n\n41\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.600\nalways offer us such great insights and\nthought processes around this.\n\n42\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.190\nSo what is, if I was to ask you,\nthe working definition?\n\n43\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.190\nWhat do you think data\nacquisition entails?\n\n44\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.460\nWhat should we tell the kind folk out\nthere in our dry studio audience, right?\n\n45\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.010\nWhat data acquisition is,\nwhat do we want to tell them?\n\n46\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.810\n&gt;&gt; I would say that it is the acquisition,\n\n47\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.030\nit's kind of a self-thing\n&gt;&gt; Ok, wait wait\n\n48\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.570\n&gt;&gt; Can't use the\n\n49\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Can't use the term to describe the term\n\n50\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, right I\n\n51\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.240\nwas going to explain that-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n52\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.120\n&gt;&gt; I was not gonna do that even though it\n\n53\n00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.770\nis a very self-defining term\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n54\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.460\nThis is the gathering of digital\nevidence in a forensically sound wave.\n\n55\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.880\nThat's my-\n&gt;&gt; That is awesome.\n\n56\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.570\nWe like that.\n&gt;&gt; In a box.\n\n57\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the gathering up of, or\n\n58\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.870\nthe collection of-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Another way to say that\nacquisition without saying it, right?\n\n60\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.760\nGathering up collection of evidence in and\n\n61\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670\nmost importantly Important point\nthat Daniel threw in there.\n\n62\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.510\nProbably the critical defining\ncharacteristic of the definition\n\n63\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.830\nforensically sound now, right?\n\n64\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.410\nVery important, we talked about that.\n\n65\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.130\nAnd we're gathering data from where?\n\n66\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.310\nWhere would we be wanting\nto gather data from?\n\n67\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually from-\n&gt;&gt; Anywhere, right?\n\n68\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be anywhere,\nhard drives, flash drives,\n\n69\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.470\ncloud storage, just anywhere that\nwill hold data that is evidence.\n\n70\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.130\n&gt;&gt; Mobile device?\n\n71\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, mobile devices.\n\n72\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Mobile devices,\nremovable storage, thick storage..\n\n73\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.780\nAll sorts of places, right?\n\n74\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.390\nIn other words anywhere as Daniel\nsaid where data could live,\n\n75\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.970\nwhere devices and material will be found.\n\n76\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.850\nAnd we'll have interest that's where\nwe're gonna go to gather that data.\n\n77\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.800\n&gt;&gt; I wonder whenever the matrix\nbecomes a real thing are they gonna\n\n78\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.650\nactually investigate our heads.\n\n79\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n80\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Cuz in theory, right?\n\n81\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.510\n&gt;&gt; That is now an extension\nof the repository where.\n\n82\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So, I actually saw a really interesting\n\n83\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.840\nshow one of the few things to watch on\nTV recently that was not a movie or\n\n84\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.650\nan old [LAUGH] replay of something.\n\n85\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.630\n&gt;&gt; They realize this is\nalready bull [LAUGH].\n\n86\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nBut we've talked, you and\n\n87\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.980\nI both share a passion for documentaries.\n\n88\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.330\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; And things of science and\n\n89\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.240\nthings like that.\n\n90\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.445\nSo I saw this really\ninteresting conversation,\n\n91\n00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:38.700\nor this discussion, more like a TED talk,\nbut a little more extensive.\n\n92\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But around the future of robotics and\n\n93\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.630\njust kind of where we are heading,\ncybernetics, and just kind of\n\n94\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.050\nthe integration of these things and how\n&gt;&gt; Really, the trend will ultimately be,\n\n95\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.990\nat some point, to move beyond simply,\nokay, either you are a robot.\n\n96\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.356\nNot you, but\nyou have robots versus humans and\n\n97\n00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.550\nthis integration of the two at some point.\n\n98\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.800\nBut ultimately,\nif we are succesful down the road and\n\n99\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.570\nenabled machines become\nartificially intelligent.\n\n100\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.800\nYou know, this is the scenario you see in\nall these movies where essentially at some\n\n101\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.100\npoint, they become smart enough that\nthey don't necessarily require us.\n\n102\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.900\nWe may become the cybernetic organisms\nthat actually, and the talk was geared\n\n103\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.080\naround this idea of how do we prepare for\nspace travel and deep space exploration.\n\n104\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.120\nNow here we're gonna go to the moon,\nmaybe go to Mars.\n\n105\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.340\nCertainly our next leap forward will most\nlikely be making in our lifetimes I would\n\n106\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.260\nthink realistically, but out beyond that,\n\n107\n00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.060\nthe human body's not designed to be\nin space for long periods of time.\n\n108\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.130\nYou really can't survive and\nthrive there, in our forum, currently.\n\n109\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.000\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty hostile to us.\n\n110\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In a machine forum, Right?\n\n111\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.750\nYou lose body mass.\n\n112\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You lose muscle tone.\n\n113\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.420\nAll these things, our bodies are not\ndesigned to be in space in even short,\n\n114\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.140\nlet alone long term scenarios, but\n\n115\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.550\nif you think about the fact,\nreally do deep space exploration.\n\n116\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.090\nOut into the rest of the galaxy and\nfurther, the Star Trek, right,\n\n117\n00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.950\nthought process.\n\n118\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.200\nYears, decades, who knows, maybe\ncenturies from now, but at some point,\n\n119\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.110\nwe would have to, at least the theory\ngoes right now, perhaps morph into some\n\n120\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.540\nsort of hybrid beings because we may not\nbe able to travel and do the things we\n\n121\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.940\nwanna do to explore in our current form,\nbecause our bodies won't allow us to.\n\n122\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.320\nWe just won't be able to survive.\n\n123\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.060\nInteresting thoughts.\n\n124\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.210\n&gt;&gt; So just it's essentially where you take\nthat and what that becomes because at that\n\n125\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.110\npoint your data acquisition, data\nexploration is really the idea of just\n\n126\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.790\nintegrating with this broader,\n&gt;&gt; The system.\n\n127\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Machine based system.\n\n128\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.340\nThis grid.\n\n129\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.830\nSo, Become essentially like the board.\n\n130\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.920\n&gt;&gt; That is crazy to think of.\n\n131\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Think about that, right?\n\n132\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Resistance is futile,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n133\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.941\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\nWe are one of nine.\n\n134\n00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:36.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n135\n00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:36.985\n&gt;&gt; Or five of nine.\n\n136\n00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:38.373\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n137\n00:05:38.373 --> 00:05:43.240\n&gt;&gt; So ITProTV is coming to absorb and\nto encompass you very soon.\n\n138\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.040\nStep one, right?\n\n139\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Reach everybody.\n\n140\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.260\nStep two, draw them in, alright,\n\n141\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.180\nso, let's talk about live\ndata collection methodology.\n\n142\n00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.240\nOrder methodology.\n\n143\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.580\nThe order of volatility\nfollowed by the methodology.\n\n144\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.030\nYou join me here and you could see, just\nto remind ourselves of what the order of\n\n145\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.240\nvolatility is, we've talked about\nthis before, gone through and\n\n146\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.140\ntalked about the importance\nof the order of volatility.\n\n147\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.890\nRemember the list is\nthe most volatile at the top\n\n148\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.810\nmoving down towards least\nvolatile at the bottom.\n\n149\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.390\nIf I was you, talked about this before,\nremind you of this.\n\n150\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.640\nThis is one of those things that\nthere's no good way to say, so\n\n151\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.160\nI'm just gonna come right out and\ntell you: brute force memorization.\n\n152\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.700\nYou should definitely know the order\nof volatility with regards to exam\n\n153\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.460\npreparation gonna be important.\n\n154\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.180\nIn the real world applying these skills\nout beyond \"Hey I wanna take a test,\n\n155\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.300\npass an exam,\n\n156\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.830\nput a credential next to my name,\" very\nimportant as one step in a multi-step\n\n157\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.540\nprocess to prepare to actually use\nthese skills in the real world.\n\n158\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.620\nBut out beyond that,\nwe have to know the order of volatility so\n\n159\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.850\nwe practice it, use it,\nlive it, love it, learn it and\n\n160\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.950\nas they say, because this is what we do in\nthe way we do it, the order we do it in.\n\n161\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.560\nThis is how we actually click\nforensically sound evidence,\n\n162\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.180\nsort of that point we are talking\nabout some of these things and\n\n163\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.090\nI done these demos in some other episodes,\nso bring it up here.\n\n164\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.642\nWhat I'm gonna do is kinda\nmove this off to the side and\n\n165\n00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:58.180\nyou'll kind look up the order of\nvolatility here after this minute.\n\n166\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.810\nWhile I just started typing some stuff in,\n\n167\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.800\nbut let's focus on area one \"Registers and\nCaches'' for just a minute, right?\n\n168\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.840\nWhat's in some of the most volatile and\ndynamic memory areas or\n\n169\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.020\nareas in the system, what we traditionally\nthink of things like the name resolver\n\n170\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.240\ncache so the optic ip config resolver DNS\nwould be a good example of this, right?\n\n171\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.745\nso if we did ipconfig /displaydns, right?\n\n172\n00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:25.130\nAnd we would see I did not type that.\n\n173\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It wasn't displayed.\n\n174\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.110\n&gt;&gt; It never was.\n\n175\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.926\nI don't even bother\npaying attention anymore.\n\n176\n00:07:30.926 --> 00:07:32.212\nDislpay, dislpay.\n\n177\n00:07:32.212 --> 00:07:32.855\n&gt;&gt; Dislpay.\n\n178\n00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:34.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a new form\n\n179\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.560\nof auto pay like Apple Pay and\nlike Android Pay, right?\n\n180\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.160\nGoogle Pay, dislpay.\n\n181\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.452\n&gt;&gt; You're banging dsl.\n\n182\n00:07:40.452 --> 00:07:42.671\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, display DNS.\n\n183\n00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.493\nNever fails.\n\n184\n00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:45.870\nYou can see That we would have to go in,\nfor instance, and\n\n185\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.440\ngrab this kind of information.\n\n186\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.820\nI did this one of the very\nfirst shows where we did this.\n\n187\n00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.090\nI said, hey.\nAnd then if I outputted this, right?\n\n188\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.243\nAnd I did it to a text file locally,\ngreat.\n\n189\n00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:55.926\nBut not forensically sound.\n\n190\n00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.708\nModified the hard drive.\n\n191\n00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.272\nModified access stamps,\nmodified file data,\n\n192\n00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:04.510\nwe should push that out of the system to\nan external device for a write blocker.\n\n193\n00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.060\nAnd we've talked about that methodology,\n\n194\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.910\nwe've talked about that\nin other shows as well.\n\n195\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.490\nBut just the idea of where to\ngo to capture this data, right,\n\n196\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.350\nwhat about something like the arcache?\n\n197\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.220\nAnd looking at the arcache,\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n198\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.620\nLet me center this on the screen for\nus there.\n\n199\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.890\nAgain, dynamic, volatile data in\nthe system, but the arcache is mixed.\n\n200\n00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.795\nYou could see there was static entries,\nor are static entries in the arcache.\n\n201\n00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:30.170\nWe'll see them there towards the bottom,\nthe last eight or so.\n\n202\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.110\nThose would remain if I\npower cycled the machine,\n\n203\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.180\nturned it off,\nbrought it back up, shut it down,\n\n204\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.820\ndid a cold boot, I would clear that\ninformation, the dynamic information.\n\n205\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.560\nTop static information would stay.\n\n206\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.670\nStatic information, if you look at\nthe address in there is going to\n\n207\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.225\nallow us to see and understand what\nout broadcast address range is,\n\n208\n00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:53.022\nour multicast address range,\nthings like that.\n\n209\n00:08:53.022 --> 00:08:56.510\nWhatever addresses maybe\nassigned in that range, so we're\n\n210\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.230\nnot looking in stuff that would change or\nrather stuff that would stay the same.\n\n211\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.768\nDo we need to capture both in\norder to capture the dynamic?\n\n212\n00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:03.620\nYeah, we would.\n\n213\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.987\nWe need to dump the arcache and\nget a record of it.\n\n214\n00:09:05.987 --> 00:09:08.625\nWhat about something like netstat?\n\n215\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.631\nNetsata.\n\n216\n00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:13.251\nThat would also be [CROSSTALK].\n\n217\n00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:15.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Netsata.\n&gt;&gt; That's the network command for\n\n218\n00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:17.250\nhard drives that are serial ATA.\n\n219\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.825\nIt's a new one.\nYou haven't heard of that one before?\n\n220\n00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:22.439\n[CROSSTALK] We have Netata as well.\n\n221\n00:09:22.439 --> 00:09:23.028\nWe do not, by the way.\n\n222\n00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:24.460\nTotally kidding about that.\n\n223\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.164\n&gt;&gt; All made up.\n\n224\n00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.637\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is me just not being able to\n\n225\n00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:27.170\ntype, right?\n\n226\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.420\nSo net stat.\n\n227\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.560\nI can never type stat.\n\n228\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.780\n&gt;&gt; You still can't do it.\n\n229\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Net sot.\n\n230\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.280\nIt's like my fingers\nhave a mind of their own.\n\n231\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.368\nIt's also with for, I constantly type fro,\nF-R-O instead of for when I'm typing,\n\n232\n00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:37.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n233\n00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:38.198\n&gt;&gt; I can never get it right.\n\n234\n00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:39.783\n&gt;&gt; I can't do management.\n\n235\n00:09:39.783 --> 00:09:41.819\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what it it, yeah.\n\n236\n00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:43.710\n&gt;&gt; For whatever reason, I cannot get the E\nbetween the E and the M in management.\n\n237\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.490\nI always leave that out.\n\n238\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.280\n&gt;&gt; There are certain things that just\nelude me, and I consider myself to be\n\n239\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.765\na fairly with it kinda guy,\nI just cannot do certain things.\n\n240\n00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.930\n[LAUGH] All right so netstat -a for\n\n241\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.120\nthe adaptor, now we can do -na, you'll\nhear me talk about that sometimes as well.\n\n242\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.410\nNumerically list and\nthen list all for the adapters.\n\n243\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.970\nIt's just a question of manipulating\nthe switches with netstat,\n\n244\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.940\nit's up to you to decide but\nessentially, however you do it,\n\n245\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.690\nwe get data from netstat,\nnbtstat would be another one, netbios.\n\n246\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.860\nAll of these are gonna be considered\nvolatile data elements we wanna capture.\n\n247\n00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.640\nBecause this is all data, then state and\n\n248\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.530\nstatus that is in the current\nstate of the system.\n\n249\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.810\nNow interestingly, let's say that we're\ndealing, as we are here realistically,\n\n250\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.650\nwe're dealing with a virtual machine\nas opposed to a physical machine.\n\n251\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.110\nYou know, one that's actually let's\nsay the laptop itself versus the VM,\n\n252\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.910\nthe Windows 10 VM running\non top of the Mac, right.\n\n253\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.330\nIf I wanted to do this I could\ncertainly capture all this.\n\n254\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.200\nSince this volatile data is in the system.\n\n255\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.430\nBut when it's a virtual machine I've\ngot some additional capabilities I\n\n256\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.298\ncould bring to bear.\n\n257\n00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:46.100\nWhat about snapshotting the system\ngetting a complete state\n\n258\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.980\nmemory state included of\nthe VM running on the host.\n\n259\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.810\nSo we do a traditional quote on quote\nsnapshot with full memory state.\n\n260\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:58.070\nAnd then, if I've done that, that snapshot\nfile, depending on vendor, right?\n\n261\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.190\nWhether it's Microsoft,\nwhether it's VMware, whether it's Citrix.\n\n262\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.980\nWhatever snapshot technology\nis in play there.\n\n263\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.830\nWhatever the file extensions will be.\n\n264\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.740\nHowever that's set up.\n\n265\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.770\nCuz they differ.\n\n266\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.910\nAll of them use volume shadow\nsnapshot service and writer.\n\n267\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.340\nBut however they get the snapshot\nat the end of the day, right?\n\n268\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.020\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n269\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.750\nThe point is we have a snapshot file,\nor a series of files, could I use those\n\n270\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.250\nif captured in a forensically sound matter\nas images that are pushed off the systems\n\n271\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.010\nthrough a write blocker to represent\nthe current state including volatile data?\n\n272\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.520\nAbsolutely, I'd have\nthe current state of memory.\n\n273\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.670\nI could restore that system and\n\n274\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.000\nit would look identical right\nnow to what I'm seeing live.\n\n275\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.850\nSo with virtualized machines,\nas an investigator,\n\n276\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.420\nwe've actually got some\nadditional capabilities and.\n\n277\n00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.670\nIf we're smart about it,\nsome things that we could do\n\n278\n00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.370\nthat we may not have access to with a\nphysical machine, because while in theory,\n\n279\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.640\nyou can use backup software\nto snapshot the machine.\n\n280\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.380\nSystem Restore, for instance in Windows,\nis essentially a snapshot.\n\n281\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.860\nIf you think about the logic of that,\n\n282\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.830\nit's a snapshot with a graphical interface\nthat lets us go backwards in time.\n\n283\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.590\nAnd this is interesting as\na forensic anomaly as well.\n\n284\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.460\nIf I do System Restore Points,\nwhich is often done in Windows, and\n\n285\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.760\nI can leverage those as\na forensic investigator.\n\n286\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.640\nSo here's one for you,\n\n287\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.490\nwe haven't talked about-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n288\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.100\n&gt;&gt; Tell me if you can\nunderstand the logic of this.\n\n289\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.480\nSo, if I have a system restore point,\nright?\n\n290\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're familiar with the thought,\n\n291\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.020\nthe broad thought process right.\n\n292\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And if I have one or more of those,\n\n293\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.500\nessentially points in time captured,\narchived in the local hard drive,\n\n294\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.520\navailable for\nme to go back to and restore.\n\n295\n00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n296\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.810\nif I do that, am I forensically able\nto examine that image and gather\n\n297\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.100\nevidence that would be different than what\nis currently the state of the machine?\n\n298\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.740\nIn other words, could I use that\nsnapshotted image, that system restore,\n\n299\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.330\ncould I use that as a specific reference\npoint to do a forensic investigation?\n\n300\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.900\n&gt;&gt; As a specific reference point I\nthink in theory I would say yes.\n\n301\n00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Not just in theory but\nin actuality right?\n\n302\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But think about the logic of this.\n\n303\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.180\nWhat I'm getting at is the following.\n\n304\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.420\nIf I took those restore files, I restored\nthem outside of the system obviously\n\n305\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.890\nto essentially a copy of the system.\n\n306\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.440\nPut them back.\n\n307\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.740\nI'm not only getting\nthe state of the machine, but\n\n308\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.880\nagain the state of the registry\nat that moment in time.\n\n309\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.770\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n310\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.540\n&gt;&gt; And now I can go back and I can\nquery and interrogate the registry and\n\n311\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.650\nthe state of the system, because it has\ntime-traveled backwards to whatever point\n\n312\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.720\nin time, maybe prior to when the bad\nact occurred, so I can do a before.\n\n313\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.940\nHey look, this is before the attack\noccurred, I've got the current state and\n\n314\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.480\nthe after, let's do a delta comparison.\n\n315\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.570\nYou know, run a script that's going to\ntell me every file that exists in one and\n\n316\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.160\ndoesn't exist in the other,\n\n317\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.890\nhighlight those I got a list of\n45 files that are different.\n\n318\n00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.640\nGuess what I'm looking for, right?\n\n319\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.760\nI'm looking for hashes,\n\n320\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.910\nI'm looking for information about where\nthose files came from, who put them there,\n\n321\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.220\nwhen they were put there,\nwhen they were accessed, and what they do.\n\n322\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.270\nAnd I'm going to start running back and\nforth between these images and\n\n323\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.530\nI'm gonna zero in on the exact changes\nthat took place over that period of time.\n\n324\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.050\nSo it's actually a really powerful set of\ntools we can bring to bear if we are able\n\n325\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.580\nto use snapshotting and time travel\nlegitimately, moving backwards and\n\n326\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.280\nforwards in time around the image.\n\n327\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.440\nThis is a great way to\ncapture dynamic data.\n\n328\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.390\nBut to do it in a forensically sound and\n\n329\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.530\nthen static off load way where\nI can then use it on demand.\n\n330\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.650\n&gt;&gt; That's very true.\n&gt;&gt; When you think about it,\n\n331\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.560\nit's really kind of neat.\n\n332\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.260\n&gt;&gt; That is really neat.\n\n333\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.290\n&gt;&gt; At least I think it's pretty cool.\n\n334\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.260\nI mean, I think it's fascinating\nthe stuff we can get up to today.\n\n335\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.120\nI really do.\n\n336\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.490\nI mean, more and more, we're just\nable to delve into these systems,\n\n337\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.180\nreach almost back to the creation point,\nliterally, if we're smart.\n\n338\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.480\nAnd start just picking apart the pieces\nand saying, I want this, I want that.\n\n339\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.330\nI want to know where this or\nthis did not or did come from.\n\n340\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.420\nWhat about statistical stuff?\n\n341\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.730\nJoin me over here if you will.\n\n342\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.860\nSo we often talk about things like this.\n\n343\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.480\nLet me actually clear the screen before we\ndo this cuz it's kinda hard to see this\n\n344\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.660\ndown at the bottom, right?\n\n345\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.820\nSo normally we say to you, hey, let's take\na look at the system date or system time.\n\n346\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.070\nWanna do a comparison,\nmake sure the time stamps, date stamps,\n\n347\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.660\nuniversal time coordination,\nthings like that are spot on.\n\n348\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.660\nA lot of times somebody says\nI know how to find the date.\n\n349\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.400\nLet me just enter the date command, well.\n\n350\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.490\nUnfortunately, that's not\nthe right way to do it, right?\n\n351\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.060\nThat is, but not exactly.\n\n352\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.020\n&gt;&gt; It does show the date.\n\n353\n00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.620\n&gt;&gt; It does, but it gives you\nthe opportunity to modify it and\n\n354\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.410\nif you're not paying attention,\nguess what you just did, right?\n\n355\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.640\nYou basically blew the system up.\n\n356\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.010\nWe're not allowed to use it anymore\nbecause it is not January first\n\n357\n00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.680\nof 2000, right?\n\n358\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.656\nIt is something different.\n\n359\n00:15:02.656 --> 00:15:05.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n&gt;&gt; So as a result what we need to do\n\n360\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.370\nis make sure that we understand, and\nwe've talked about this before, right?\n\n361\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.850\nMake sure you're paying\nattention what you're typing.\n\n362\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.490\nMake sure that you read.\n\n363\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.330\nHold on.\nYou know what,\n\n364\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.665\nhave I said how much I\nhate the Apple keyboard?\n\n365\n00:15:17.665 --> 00:15:19.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I keep hitting the function key.\n\n366\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.470\n&gt;&gt; That is great.\n\n367\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Who puts the function key\nat the far left hand side?\n\n368\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.950\n&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs, that's it.\n\n369\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.565\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, that's exactly who.\n\n370\n00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:26.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n371\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.470\nthe rest of the world the function key\nis somewhere else than the control key.\n\n372\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to my page.\n\n373\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.250\n&gt;&gt; It's where it supposed to be.\n\n374\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.400\nWho does that?\n\n375\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.910\nWhat were they thinking?\n\n376\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.820\nHe must have really been pissed at Bill\nGates and said, I'm gonna get everybody.\n\n377\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.810\n&gt;&gt; He said I'm gonna do everything\ndiametrically opposed to\n\n378\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.110\neverything on his system.\n\n379\n00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna show him, boy.\n\n380\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.050\nMy god.\nAll right so, date /?.\n\n381\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.380\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n382\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.811\nWe wanna the help file, very important.\n\n383\n00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:54.815\nTyping /t allows us to be able\nto actually see the date.\n\n384\n00:15:54.815 --> 00:15:55.892\nRight, or the time.\n\n385\n00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:58.281\nJust do the same thing with time,\ntime for.\n\n386\n00:15:58.281 --> 00:15:59.710\nSee it without modifying it, right?\n\n387\n00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.160\nThis is how we would\nforensically capture date and\n\n388\n00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.160\ntime on the system by doing that without\nmodifying it, very important to know that.\n\n389\n00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.503\nHere's another one that you may or\nmay not be familiar with, right?\n\n390\n00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:16.144\nLet's say that I wanted to see the cache\nof the history inside the DOS shell here.\n\n391\n00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:19.288\nIn other words, I could up arrow and\nsay look, I entered all these commands,\n\n392\n00:16:19.288 --> 00:16:20.722\nthat's interesting.\n\n393\n00:16:20.722 --> 00:16:22.820\nBut I'm not gonna up the arrow\nthrough every command.\n\n394\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.352\nI'm only gonna\n\n395\n00:16:23.352 --> 00:16:26.002\nget a certain amount because there's\na buffer maintaining so many.\n\n396\n00:16:26.002 --> 00:16:28.622\nAnd I can't capture them by doing that.\n\n397\n00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.042\nBut is there a way to do this?\n\n398\n00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:31.612\nYes, sure, there's a way.\n\n399\n00:16:31.612 --> 00:16:33.606\nI want the history, maybe I type history.\n\n400\n00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:36.406\nWell, first of all,\nyou're in theory correct but not quite.\n\n401\n00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:39.816\nSo we have to type history as a subset\nof another command, number one.\n\n402\n00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:42.066\nBut number two, and interestingly,\nyou and I were talking about this,\n\n403\n00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:43.486\nright, before we came on.\n\n404\n00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:46.248\nHistory is an actual command\nyou would use in certain OSs.\n\n405\n00:16:46.248 --> 00:16:49.290\nYou would use it in the Mac and LINUX OSs,\nfor instance, to see things, but\n\n406\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.365\nyou wouldn't do it here.\n\n407\n00:16:50.365 --> 00:16:52.968\nYou have to use something else here.\n\n408\n00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:56.011\nAnd so here we would have to\nknow that there is a subset,\n\n409\n00:16:56.011 --> 00:16:59.488\nrather a command you would use\nin the subset for history.\n\n410\n00:16:59.488 --> 00:17:00.898\nDOSKEY is the command.\n\n411\n00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:02.548\nBut if you don't know the right command,\n\n412\n00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:05.368\nthis is not the machine to start\nsearching around on it for\n\n413\n00:17:05.368 --> 00:17:08.410\nbecause you're going to enter a bunch of\nstuff that's gonna modify the system.\n\n414\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.890\nYou've gotta go to another machine,\nfigure that out, or\n\n415\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.810\ncome prepared with your\ncheat sheet of commands.\n\n416\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.390\nThere's no shame in saying, hey,\nI don't remember everything.\n\n417\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.490\nLet me write it down.\n\n418\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.471\nNothing wrong with that, right?\n\n419\n00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.740\nBut if you weren't sure,\nwhat would you do?\n\n420\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.270\nWell, on another machine, you would type\nhelp, right, to look at the base commands.\n\n421\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.990\nIn this case we're going after\nthe DOSKEY command right here.\n\n422\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.224\nSo we're gonna be able to go in,\nrecalls windows commands, creates macros,\n\n423\n00:17:33.224 --> 00:17:34.160\nedits command lines.\n\n424\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.700\nGotta be careful how we use this because\nif we're not using it the right way,\n\n425\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.920\nas you can see,\nwe can modify things, right.\n\n426\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.550\nSo we would wanna look at the help\nfile specifically for DOSKEY.\n\n427\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.570\nThere's a lot of stuff in there, right?\n\n428\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.310\nYou don't wanna reinstall obviously.\n\n429\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.370\nYou don't wanna change the macros or\nanything like that, but\n\n430\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.430\nyou do wanna go ahead and\nyou do want to look at the history for\n\n431\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.890\nall the commands stored in memory.\n\n432\n00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.205\nThis is dynamic volatile data right there,\nright?\n\n433\n00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:03.056\nNow, you can do /H or HISTORY,\nit's essentially the same.\n\n434\n00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:04.276\nIt's just shorthand for that.\n\n435\n00:18:04.276 --> 00:18:06.550\nIt's one of the nice\nthings I like about this.\n\n436\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.220\nYou can shorthand a lot of these commands,\nright?\n\n437\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.719\nSo you could do DOSKEY/H and\n\n438\n00:18:10.719 --> 00:18:15.820\nyou'll get a list, as you can see,\nof all the stuff that we've typed in.\n\n439\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.480\nAnd could you then capture that?\n\n440\n00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.780\nYeah, just output that\nthrough a right blocker.\n\n441\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.280\nYou've got an accurate copy of\nall the key entries that have\n\n442\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.790\nbeen made on the historical reference for\nthe buffer in the DOS shell, or\n\n443\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.320\nany command shell that you're looking at.\n\n444\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.640\nYou would do that through each one.\n\n445\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.400\nYou could do that in PowerShell and\npull the commands out of PowerShell.\n\n446\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.210\nSo open and being used there.\n\n447\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.450\nYeah, it works the same way, right?\n\n448\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.300\nYou can do that as well.\n\n449\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.244\nSo this is the kind of thing,\nright, that we would need to know.\n\n450\n00:18:37.244 --> 00:18:38.631\nThis is how we're going in and\n\n451\n00:18:38.631 --> 00:18:41.980\nstarting to capture this data\nthat we're talking about, right?\n\n452\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.180\nRouting tables, you've seen me\npull up the routing table for\n\n453\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.340\nroute print, look at what's static,\nlook at what's dynamic there.\n\n454\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.720\nTemporary files, got them all over\nthe place, applications running,\n\n455\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.860\nthey create swap, they create temp space,\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n456\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.450\nWe'd have to capture that through\na memory dump and a hard drive image.\n\n457\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.590\nDisk and storage media, a hard drive\nimage would certainly do that.\n\n458\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.840\nLogs and monitoring data,\nsystem configuration and/or topology.\n\n459\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.740\nAre we domain joined?\n\n460\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.700\nAre we standalone?\n\n461\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.540\nAre we wireless?\n\n462\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.700\nAre we wired?\n\n463\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.730\nHow are we configured?\n\n464\n00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.840\nThat kind of thing.\n\n465\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.830\nArchival media, medium and\nlong-term storage, backup images,\n\n466\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.200\nmaybe system state if we're in a domain\ncontroller, that kind of thing.\n\n467\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.090\nWe wanna know all that.\n\n468\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.300\nWhat about the live data\ncollection methodology?\n\n469\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.440\nWe talked about the fact\nthere is a methodology here.\n\n470\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.020\nWe have to prepare to, actually,\nengaging in some response.\n\n471\n00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.549\nAnd this is what we do before\nwe actually leave the building,\n\n472\n00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:34.743\nbefore we actually set foot\nin the vehicle, right?\n\n473\n00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:36.850\nI think about Ghostbusters sometimes.\n\n474\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.590\nI think about this, right?\n\n475\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.656\nThe original movie, where they finally\nget into the hey, we're gonna go out and\n\n476\n00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:41.660\nbe in the ghost business.\n\n477\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.790\nCuz in the beginning they're\na bunch of bumbling idiots, right?\n\n478\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.245\nThey show up, they don't know what they're\ndoing, they don't have the right tools.\n\n479\n00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:50.097\nAnd then eventually,\nI remember that scene where Dan Aykroyd,\n\n480\n00:19:50.097 --> 00:19:54.460\nthey're driving back in from being\nout all night capturing ghosts.\n\n481\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.143\nHe's got the cigarette,\nhe's talking in the car.\n\n482\n00:19:58.143 --> 00:19:59.676\nI forget which one of them was driving.\n\n483\n00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.859\nHe wasn't driving,\nmaybe the other guy was.\n\n484\n00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:04.402\nBut they're talking as they're\ndriving over the bridge back in.\n\n485\n00:20:04.402 --> 00:20:06.003\nAnd it's just like it's\njust another night, right?\n\n486\n00:20:06.003 --> 00:20:06.894\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n487\n00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:09.893\nthey got the Ghostbuster\ngun packs in the back.\n\n488\n00:20:09.893 --> 00:20:12.110\nAnd they got the traps\nwith the ghosts in them.\n\n489\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.428\nAnd everything's just kind of standard\nat that point because they have done\n\n490\n00:20:14.428 --> 00:20:15.232\nall their due diligence.\n\n491\n00:20:15.232 --> 00:20:16.422\nEverything is set up.\n\n492\n00:20:16.422 --> 00:20:20.660\nYou gotta plan, right, to think about\nhow you're gonna be successful.\n\n493\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.980\nPlan to plan, right, as you often say.\n\n494\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.250\nWe've gotta plan to plan.\n\n495\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.070\nI say we've got to plan to be successful\nbecause if we're not going to do that,\n\n496\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.510\nwe're planning to fail, right?\n\n497\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.455\nNo plan is essentially\na decision you've made.\n\n498\n00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:33.150\nYou've just made a really bad one, right?\n\n499\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.195\nSo you gotta make sure you got all the\nthings that have to happen ahead of time.\n\n500\n00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:38.950\nHave you got the forensic\nworkstation set up?\n\n501\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.680\nDo you have a mobile capability?\n\n502\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.230\nHave you updated the software?\n\n503\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.990\nHave you patched it?\n\n504\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.990\nDo you have batteries?\n\n505\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.110\nAre they charged?\nDo you have cables, right?\n\n506\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.870\nDo you have all that stuff?\n\n507\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.540\nHey, we went out, did five incidents\nyesterday, got no more gloves,\n\n508\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.940\nno more incident bags, no more tags.\n\n509\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.390\nGotta restock all that stuff.\n\n510\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.550\nAll that stuff doesn't\ncome from [INAUDIBLE].\n\n511\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.663\nSomebody's gotta put it there.\n\n512\n00:20:56.663 --> 00:20:58.986\n&gt;&gt; When I worked construction,\nwe used to have a saying,\n\n513\n00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:00.563\nthis isn't my first rodeo, right?\n\n514\n00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:01.703\nThis isn't the first time.\n\n515\n00:21:01.703 --> 00:21:04.625\nAfter a while,\nthis becomes very second nature to you,\n\n516\n00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:09.010\nbecause you've done it over and over and\nover again, and it becomes really easy.\n\n517\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.640\nSo right now you might be thinking,\nmy goodness, there's just so\n\n518\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.830\nmuch information.\n\n519\n00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.130\nYeah, right now, you feel like\nyou're drinking from a fire hose.\n\n520\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.090\nBut the more you're at it, the more you\npractice at it, the more you understand\n\n521\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.390\nthe concepts and have experience with it,\nit just becomes second nature.\n\n522\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:27.880\nSo being able to do what Adam is talking\nabout will be easier as you continue on.\n\n523\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go with that.\n\n524\n00:21:29.302 --> 00:21:29.888\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:30.734\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was just checking\n\n526\n00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:32.735\na note real quick on something\nI wanted to mentioned but yeah,\n\n527\n00:21:32.735 --> 00:21:34.746\nlistening to what Daniel said,\nagreeing with him 100%.\n\n528\n00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:37.960\nBut keep in mind, right,\njust augment what Daniel said.\n\n529\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.430\nDefinitely becomes easier the more\nyou do it, but here's the thing.\n\n530\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.159\nThere's a lot of stuff that stays\nthe same, as you were saying.\n\n531\n00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:44.906\nHey, I've got my list, I don't know,\nconstruction trade, probably need,\n\n532\n00:21:44.906 --> 00:21:47.620\ndepending on what kinda construction\nwe're doing, I'm thinking roofing.\n\n533\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.854\nYou've gotta always have nails,\nright, no matter what you do.\n\n534\n00:21:49.854 --> 00:21:50.551\n&gt;&gt; Bridge builder.\n\n535\n00:21:50.551 --> 00:21:53.421\n&gt;&gt; You need bigger nails for\nbridge building, right?\n\n536\n00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:54.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have some really big\n\n537\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.850\nnails to build bridges, but\nyou probably needed nails, right?\n\n538\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.570\nYou needed screws.\n\n539\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.670\nYou needed a hammer.\n\n540\n00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.350\nYou always needed a who knows what.\n\n541\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.503\nRight, steel girders for bridges, right?\n\n542\n00:22:02.503 --> 00:22:03.133\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n543\n00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:03.645\n&gt;&gt; Concrete.\n\n544\n00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:04.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My point is there's certain\n\n545\n00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:05.450\nthings you do need.\n\n546\n00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.770\nIt's on that list, you always know.\n\n547\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.351\nBut then there are number one,\nare special things and number two,\n\n548\n00:22:09.351 --> 00:22:11.715\nthere are things that change,\nright, that may be updated.\n\n549\n00:22:11.715 --> 00:22:16.652\nThe hardest part of our jobs in IT and\nsecurity and anything that any of us\n\n550\n00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:21.552\ndo and all of us love to do all the time\nis not to figure out the basics.\n\n551\n00:22:21.552 --> 00:22:24.574\nBut to keep up with the trends\nthat are forcing us to react and\n\n552\n00:22:24.574 --> 00:22:28.262\ntherefore to adjust what we do that is\nthe norm that we are comfortable and\n\n553\n00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:32.192\nconfident with in order to come up with\nthe way that we not only stay relevant,\n\n554\n00:22:32.192 --> 00:22:34.262\nbut that we stay ahead of the curve.\n\n555\n00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:35.702\nThat's probably the most\nchallenging part for me.\n\n556\n00:22:35.702 --> 00:22:36.562\nI've been doing this for\n\n557\n00:22:36.562 --> 00:22:40.612\nover 30 years, and the reality is\nI learn something new every day.\n\n558\n00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:43.572\nI try to learn multiple things new\nevery day, but no matter what,\n\n559\n00:22:43.572 --> 00:22:47.780\nwhen I'm involved with a customer, when\nI'm on site, when I'm talking to students,\n\n560\n00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.290\nwhen I'm interacting with Daniel or\nany of the hosts here, Cherokee,\n\n561\n00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.680\nMike, Ronnie, whoever it is, Wes,\nI'm trying not to leave anybody out.\n\n562\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.070\nWhoever it may be,\nwhen I'm talking to them or\n\n563\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.080\nwe're talking offline or\nwe're doing a show, I always learn or\n\n564\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.570\nhear about or find out about something\nnew that I may not have known about, or\n\n565\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.692\nmay have forgotten about,\ncuz it's been so long since I did that.\n\n566\n00:23:07.692 --> 00:23:10.800\nAnd that's the exciting part of our jobs,\nright?\n\n567\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.020\nBut it's also the challenging part,\n\n568\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.700\nbecause it's the part that's\nhardest to keep up with.\n\n569\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.915\nAnd it's the kind of job, literally,\nespecially in this end of security\n\n570\n00:23:17.915 --> 00:23:20.905\nwhere if you're not doing it every\nday you're not relevant five, six,\n\n571\n00:23:20.905 --> 00:23:22.175\nseven months down the road.\n\n572\n00:23:22.175 --> 00:23:25.735\nYou may have learned something really\ncool, that's a baseline concept.\n\n573\n00:23:25.735 --> 00:23:27.048\nAnd, yeah, imaging is imaging.\n\n574\n00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:28.273\nIt doesn't change that much.\n\n575\n00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:31.426\nBut the tools we use to examine those\nimages are very different today than they\n\n576\n00:23:31.426 --> 00:23:34.531\nwere even just a couple years ago because\nnow we have to worry about capturing\n\n577\n00:23:34.531 --> 00:23:35.320\ncloud based data.\n\n578\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.121\nYou mentioned that.\n\n579\n00:23:36.121 --> 00:23:40.311\nAnd mobile data has become so critical\nto what we do, if you're not able to\n\n580\n00:23:40.311 --> 00:23:44.774\nunderstand how to image a mobile device\nand do so successfully and incorporate\n\n581\n00:23:44.774 --> 00:23:49.318\nthat into your discussion around\nforensics, you're just not doing your job.\n\n582\n00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:52.922\nI mean, there's so much stuff you're\ngonna miss that that's gonna be an issue.\n\n583\n00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:55.322\nGone are the days when, occasionally,\nsomebody had a cell phone.\n\n584\n00:23:55.322 --> 00:23:57.582\nAnd if they did, biggest thing you\nhad to worry about was a call lock.\n\n585\n00:23:57.582 --> 00:23:58.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n586\n00:23:58.208 --> 00:23:59.303\n&gt;&gt; That's all there was.\n\n587\n00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:01.920\nThere weren't apps, you didn't have\ndata or any sort on this thing.\n\n588\n00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.230\nToday, people have their\nwhole lives on these devices.\n\n589\n00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.920\nI mean, literally,\neverything they do is on that device.\n\n590\n00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.730\nI have a lot of colleagues and friends,\nI've said this before, that have gotten\n\n591\n00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.030\nrid of home phones and do nothing\nliterally everything they do is on a cell\n\n592\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.740\nphone they have no, Daniel is raising\nhis hand, that would be him, right?\n\n593\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.870\nThe only reason I have a phone at home,\nhonestly, is because the cable company\n\n594\n00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.420\nconned me into believing I need one\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n595\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.050\n&gt;&gt; In order to be able to get cable and\n\n596\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.500\nto be able to get Internet.\n\n597\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.510\nBecause it's the bundle package,\nthey actually make it cheaper for\n\n598\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.840\nyou to do without it than they do with it.\n\n599\n00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.720\nAnd so we still have one.\n\n600\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.990\nEvery so often I say to my wife do\nwe really still need this thing?\n\n601\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.930\nBut then she reminds me,\nhey, yeah, but if for\n\n602\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.700\nsome odd reason god forbid there's\na storm, there's a major emergency, given\n\n603\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.780\nwhere we live in Florida this is more of a\nreality than perhaps in some areas, right?\n\n604\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.960\nAnd you know if we lose the ability to\nuse cell phones, how do you call 911?\n\n605\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.090\nYou still need a landline.\n\n606\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.190\n&gt;&gt; It's critical infrastructure.\n\n607\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.040\nIt's like first on the list\nto get back into business\n\n608\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.422\nif disaster does happen is try to\nget some phone systems back up.\n\n609\n00:24:57.422 --> 00:24:58.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it is very important,\n\n610\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.465\nit is still the primary means of\ncommunication for many, many people.\n\n611\n00:25:01.465 --> 00:25:03.486\nCuz there are many areas in our country,\nand\n\n612\n00:25:03.486 --> 00:25:07.290\nmany countries around the world where\ncell coverage is spotty or non-existent.\n\n613\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.250\nJust because of the fact they're\nout in the rural area and\n\n614\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.560\nthey're just aren't the towers there, they\nhaven't invested the infrastructure and\n\n615\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.770\nthe money to make that happen.\n\n616\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.170\nBut the phone lines are there, right?\n\n617\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.320\nBecause they've been laid\nin theory maybe 50, 60,\n\n618\n00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.160\n70 years ago whenever they\ntrenched all that out.\n\n619\n00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.350\nIt's amazing you think about that, right?\n\n620\n00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're still using\n\n621\n00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.200\nthose analog systems in many older areas\nthat have probably be in the ground for\n\n622\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.700\nmaybe upwards in theory of\n100 years at this point.\n\n623\n00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.870\nOr close to it.\n&gt;&gt; And according to you,\n\n624\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.460\nwe can go online and\nbuild our own cell towers, so.\n\n625\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.100\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n\n626\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.295\n&gt;&gt; We don't even need the-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n627\n00:25:35.295 --> 00:25:36.335\n&gt;&gt; You can build it, it's just\n\n628\n00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:36.911\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n629\n00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:39.135\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you out,\n\n630\n00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:43.850\nT-Mobile [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have I gotta a deal for you.\n\n631\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.410\nI could set you up in a way\nthat will just make you money.\n\n632\n00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.390\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to our list here.\n\n633\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.610\nSo we do have,\nwe gotta think about planning.\n\n634\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.150\nWe have incident documentation.\n\n635\n00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.600\nWe gotta obviously look at anything\nthat's going on and capture everything.\n\n636\n00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.930\nWe'll talk about the value\nof this Policy verification.\n\n637\n00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.560\nWe gotta talk about this really quickly.\n\n638\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.120\nPolicy verification implies and\nindeed comes right out and\n\n639\n00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.860\nsays not that we need to\nunderstand as investigators what\n\n640\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.000\nour overarching policies are to drive\nthe investigation, we know that.\n\n641\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.350\nWe assume that that's fine.\n\n642\n00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:15.124\nWhat I mean by that is we need\nto validate with the customer or\n\n643\n00:26:15.124 --> 00:26:20.104\nthe person who we are investigating on\nbehalf of Company ABC what policies they\n\n644\n00:26:20.104 --> 00:26:25.150\nhave in place that should be operating and\ntherefore should be adhered to.\n\n645\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.040\nAnd as part of the investigation\nare we seeing evidence of that or not?\n\n646\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:28.995\nWe have a policy that says,\n\n647\n00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:32.400\nhey, every workstation should be\nlocked the minute you walk away.\n\n648\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.790\nLiterally, you pull your access card out,\nthe machine should lock out immediately.\n\n649\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.640\nJohn did that, walked away,\nit did not for some reason.\n\n650\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.610\nSomebody sat down and\nhacked into the system.\n\n651\n00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.000\nWe gotta know that, right?\n\n652\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.340\nAnd finding out those policies are gonna\nhelp us to zero in on things that may or\n\n653\n00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.330\nmay not have occurred.\n\n654\n00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.510\nSo we have to step back, and as part of\nour due diligence, part of our planning,\n\n655\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.760\npart of our documentation gathering, we\nneed to interact with the senior leaders,\n\n656\n00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.880\nthe managers, the customer,\nwhoever can give us that insight.\n\n657\n00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.280\nAnd we need to know everything there is\nto know about the operational environment\n\n658\n00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:03.930\nwe're investigation.\n\n659\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.880\nAnd the more knowledge we gather, the\nstronger our investigation will be, and\n\n660\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.850\nthe more likely it is that,\nin theory, we will be successful and\n\n661\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.180\nfind the culprit or\npoint to the root cause of what occurred.\n\n662\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.720\nAnd this is a critical,\ncritical pivot point for us.\n\n663\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.310\nIf we're blind as to the policies and\nwe don't understand what they are,\n\n664\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.380\nI'm not suggesting we can't still do a\ngood job at gathering evidence, I'm simply\n\n665\n00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.650\nsuggesting we're not going to be able\nto correlate that evidence properly and\n\n666\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.130\nunderstand the true value and\nimpact of what it means.\n\n667\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.470\nWe're gonna be blind, in other words.\n\n668\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.670\nIt's gonna be hard for\nus to see the detail and\n\n669\n00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.270\ntherefore the importance of that evidence.\n\n670\n00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.960\nData collection strategy, gotta have\na game plan like Daniel said, right?\n\n671\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.930\nNot my first rodeo,\ngot a pretty good idea what to do.\n\n672\n00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.740\nA lot of people will say that and\nsay, yeah,\n\n673\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.840\njust I know because I've done it forever.\n\n674\n00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.650\nGreat.\n\n675\n00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.680\nHow can you transmit that to somebody\nwho hasn't done it before, right?\n\n676\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.173\nAnd it's not the information that's up in\nhere that you know because you've done it\n\n677\n00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:55.020\nfor so long that I'm worried about.\n\n678\n00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.560\nIt's the junior person that's gonna help\nyou that doesn't know what you're doing.\n\n679\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.870\nAnd you say, yeah, just do ba ba ba ba\nba without the detail, the context.\n\n680\n00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.880\nAnd maybe they skip a step.\n\n681\n00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.040\nMaybe they don't know step five is\nI should step back and wait for\n\n682\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.170\nthis command to finish.\n\n683\n00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.000\nInstead, they do five other things and\n\n684\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.780\nthey blow any chance we\nhave of gathering data.\n\n685\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.060\nWe've gotta be methodical.\n\n686\n00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.080\nI often will stress this in almost\nevery discussion we've been having in\n\n687\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.310\nthese areas.\n\n688\n00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.680\nThe policy, the process, the procedure.\n\n689\n00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.220\nTalk about the triple P, right?\n\n690\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.817\nThe policy, process, and procedure\nthat drives our ability to react,\n\n691\n00:28:26.817 --> 00:28:30.110\nbe an incident responder, and\nbe a forensic investigator.\n\n692\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:36.190\nIt's that methodology, that approach,\nthat methodical step by step time worn\n\n693\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:41.105\nprocess that we understand and\nknow that w e could use as investigators.\n\n694\n00:28:41.105 --> 00:28:44.175\nWe have to make sure everybody\naround us understands that as well.\n\n695\n00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:45.215\nVery important.\n\n696\n00:28:45.215 --> 00:28:49.035\nData collection setup, what are we doing\nto set up the collection of the data?\n\n697\n00:28:49.035 --> 00:28:51.365\nDo we have the proper software loaded?\n\n698\n00:28:51.365 --> 00:28:55.310\nHave we created a forensically sound\narea on the mobile platform or\n\n699\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.628\nout in the field where we're gonna work,\n\n700\n00:28:56.628 --> 00:29:00.580\nkind of cleaned everything off, sanitize\nthe area to the best of our abilities?\n\n701\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.290\nDon't want to be near\nthe microphone in the kitchen.\n\n702\n00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.760\nThe microphone.\n\n703\n00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.610\n&gt;&gt; The microwave.\n\n704\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, very much.\n\n705\n00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.760\nThe other kitchen device,\nthe one you make popcorn in.\n\n706\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.770\nYou don't want to be near that.\n\n707\n00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.220\nI've actually had this happen on sites or\nin places where we've had to set up in\n\n708\n00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.730\ncafeterias and stuff, and some bright-eyed\nyoung person who doesn't know better\n\n709\n00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.939\nputs all the gear over there\nby the microwave [LAUGH].\n\n710\n00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's where the outlet is, right?\n\n711\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right,\n\n712\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240\nthat's where the outlet is.\n\n713\n00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.981\nAnd so, or they set up the temporary\nwireless access point, yeah,\n\n714\n00:29:24.981 --> 00:29:27.034\nI'll just throw it right\nup on top of the microwave.\n\n715\n00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:30.260\nSomebody comes along, warms up a cup\nof coffee and you're done, right?\n\n716\n00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.630\nYou might as well throw the wireless\naccess point in the microwave for\n\n717\n00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.426\nall the good it's doing you.\n\n718\n00:29:33.426 --> 00:29:38.300\nBecause the reality is you just created\nan overwhelming electromagnetic storm\n\n719\n00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.740\naround the device, you wiped it out.\n\n720\n00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:45.100\nI've actually seen, not that it normally\nhappens, but in cases where these devices\n\n721\n00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.650\nperhaps are not working properly, they're\nnot shielded the way they should be.\n\n722\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.690\nYou could actually wipe out data on a\nmagnetic drive by putting it right on top\n\n723\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.180\nof one of these things and running it.\n\n724\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.960\nYou ever put a hard drive\nin the microwave oven?\n\n725\n00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.640\nBoy, there's a lot of fun.\n\n726\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.280\n&gt;&gt; I have yet to experience that thrill.\n\n727\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't want to be standing\nin the room when that happens.\n\n728\n00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.190\nI actually had somebody try that once.\n\n729\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.828\n&gt;&gt; Sparks will fly [LAUGH].\n\n730\n00:30:02.828 --> 00:30:04.014\n&gt;&gt; It blows up and catches fire.\n\n731\n00:30:04.014 --> 00:30:05.148\nIt is basically like a bomb.\n\n732\n00:30:05.148 --> 00:30:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you're superheating,\n\n733\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.750\nright, if you think about all the electro,\nthe electric parts.\n\n734\n00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Plus, the platters and\n\n735\n00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.040\nwhatever conductive material.\n\n736\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.380\nDepending on what they're made out of.\n\n737\n00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.680\nSome of them are ceramic, some of them,\nthey have all this stuff.\n\n738\n00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.210\nYou essentially,\nyou ever see Gross Pointe Blank?\n\n739\n00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.840\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n740\n00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, where remember in\nthe convenience store where the guy,\n\n741\n00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.460\nwhere he makes the bomb,\ntrying things out.\n\n742\n00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Makes the bomb, yeah.\n\n743\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Makes the bomb and runs out.\n\n744\n00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.829\nIt's kind of like that, only it\ndoesn't take as long to go off, right?\n\n745\n00:30:27.829 --> 00:30:28.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n746\n00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not fun, it's not pretty.\n\n747\n00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.400\nIt is actually really cool, but\nit's not something you should do,\n\n748\n00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.295\nlet me put it that way.\n\n749\n00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:35.520\n[LAUGH] So do have data collection set up.\n\n750\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.190\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n751\n00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.290\nWe're gonna come back, cuz I think we're\njust about out of time on this episode.\n\n752\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.940\nWe're gonna come back, we're gonna\ndo a deeper dive into step six.\n\n753\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.770\nThere are data collections\nprocess as noted below,\n\n754\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.210\nmeaning as noted with all\nof these steps right here.\n\n755\n00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.850\nWe wanna go through and actually\nspend some time talking about these,\n\n756\n00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.920\nmake sure we're comfortable with them.\n\n757\n00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.300\nSo you're going to come back and\njoin us for part two.\n\n758\n00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.860\nDaniel and I are going to stay put.\n\n759\n00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.840\nWe're actually not going\nto move one millimeter.\n\n760\n00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.980\nBut we are going to wait for\n\n761\n00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.430\nyou to return and we are going to continue\nour conversations as soon as we do that.\n\n762\n00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.090\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, Adam.\n\n763\n00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.970\nWe're looking forward to that.\n\n764\n00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:05.900\nHopefully you guys are as well.\n\n765\n00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.910\nThis has been a fun conversation so far.\n\n766\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.820\nSo without further ado we're\ngoing to go ahead and sign off.\n\n767\n00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.910\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n768\n00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Can we just sign right back in for\npart two like right now and keep going?\n\n769\n00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Just keep rolling.\n\n770\n00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.621\n&gt;&gt; How about we stop for like five seconds\nand we just go right into part two.\n\n771\n00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:19.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No we're not gonna do that.\n\n772\n00:31:19.532 --> 00:31:20.730\n&gt;&gt; No we're not.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna say good-bye first.\n\n773\n00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.440\nSo I'm Adam Gordon, and\nwe will see you soon.\n\n774\n00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.060\n&gt;&gt; We will.\n\n775\n00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.036\nBye.\n\n776\n00:31:24.036 --> 00:31:29.952\n[MUSIC]\n\n777\n00:31:29.952 --> 00:31:33.731\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.060\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.068\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\nwelcome back to another great episode of\n\n5\n00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:20.462\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we are moving on\n\n6\n00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:25.137\nwith more on our CHFI v9, specifically we\nare looking at data acquisition, right?\n\n7\n00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:29.326\nA very fun stuff, joining us back in the\nstudio yet again for that conversation,\n\n8\n00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:31.000\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.960\nAdam, my man, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.990\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n11\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.220\nAnd we are gonna continue,\njump right back in where we left off,\n\n12\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.200\ncontinue our conversation.\n\n13\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.810\nIf you have not seen part one, definitely\nyou wanna go back and take a look.\n\n14\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.860\nWe're walking through\nthe order of volatility,\n\n15\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.590\nmethodology around how we gather\ndata from most to least volatile.\n\n16\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.210\nDemonstrated some basic\nconcepts with you on Windows,\n\n17\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.060\ntook a look at a couple of tools,\nthings that may be valuable for you.\n\n18\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.390\nWell, really more commands than tools,\n\n19\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.790\nbut just that idea of how to\ngather some of that data.\n\n20\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.270\nTalked about the importance of it.\n\n21\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.780\nWe also talked about, or walked our way\nthrough the logic of the methodology\n\n22\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.856\naround the acquisition of data.\n\n23\n00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:05.080\nHeld off at the step six, the final step,\nwhere we actually go live,\n\n24\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.490\nstart capturing, cuz we have a detailed\nset of steps we wanna walk through,\n\n25\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.010\nwe said we'd come right back and\njump in in part two.\n\n26\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140\nWith that, so we're gonna go right\nback and start talking about that now.\n\n27\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.736\nAnd you'll see that we do have on the\nscreen here the list, just move back up so\n\n28\n00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:22.788\nyou can see the top there,\ndata collection process as noted below.\n\n29\n00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:24.950\nYou'll see we're talking about\nthe live data collection methodology.\n\n30\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.502\nWe've been through and discussed\nthe various information points and\n\n31\n00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:30.830\nimportant items that we\nneed to be aware of.\n\n32\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.852\nThe other steps in the methodology, so we\nwanna focus in now on some of the steps.\n\n33\n00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:36.618\nRecording date,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Date and time, I wanted to say time and\n\n35\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.410\ndate and I got it backwards.\n\n36\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.120\nTime and date and command history.\n\n37\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.570\nI showed you how to do that with the time\ncommand, the date command, the DOS key\n\n38\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920\nhistory command in Windows history in\nLinux, and Unix to establish an audit\n\n39\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.560\ntrail, we generate dates and times while\nexecuting each forensic tool or command.\n\n40\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.240\nGot a look at that.\n\n41\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.460\nI talked about opening up separate shells,\nand running each tool in that shell and\n\n42\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.220\nvalidating and recording that information\naccording to what you're doing there.\n\n43\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.230\nIt would be important to\nbe able to track that.\n\n44\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.100\nStart the command history,\nas we talked about,\n\n45\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.160\nand make sure you are aware of that.\n\n46\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.250\nDon't shut down or restart the system\nunder investigation until all relevant,\n\n47\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.110\nvolatile data has been recorded.\n\n48\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.730\nJust as kind of a placeholder\nthere while we're talking.\n\n49\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.960\nIn the last episode, Daniel and\nI talked a little about the value and\n\n50\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.970\nthe difference and the interestingness\nof using virtual machines.\n\n51\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.400\nThe ability to snapshot and recover from\nthere versus the physical machine and\n\n52\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.780\nsome of the differences\nthat we may see there.\n\n53\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.240\nRemember, shutting down would be something\nthat we would traditionally in order to\n\n54\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.050\nget ready to image that machine.\n\n55\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.830\nAnd so, we want to capture\nall the volatile data first.\n\n56\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.760\nAnd, then when we're done, capture and\n\n57\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.110\ncreate a forensically sound image of that\nhard drive and then, use that image.\n\n58\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.370\nWe may capture specific things off\nthe machine from a volatile evidence\n\n59\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.200\nstandpoint as part of the dynamic capture.\n\n60\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.870\nBut doing the actual imaging is\ntraditionally done when the system is\n\n61\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.860\ngoing to be shut down.\n\n62\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.240\nAnd so as a result we just\nwanna be aware of that.\n\n63\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.290\nIt's why I made the reference point to,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.730\nI dove a little bit deeper into the idea\nof system restore points, and the fact\n\n65\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.890\nthat we are capturing the dynamic state of\nthe system in that system restore point,\n\n66\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.500\nor at least the register settings and the\nstate of the system at the moment in time,\n\n67\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000\nnot 100% accurate to say,\nif we did a system restore in Windows,\n\n68\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.280\nwe get the memory state,\ncuz that's not exactly the way it works.\n\n69\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.740\nBut with a traditional snapshot,\n\n70\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.280\nand let's say the VMware, and Hyper-V and\nZen when we are capturing and\n\n71\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.600\nsnapshoting the VM we are capturing memory\nstraight as we talked about, right.\n\n72\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnd we could actually go back, and\n\n73\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.260\nload that snapshot file up and\nrestore the system\n\n74\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.130\nto that exact moment in time dynamically\nwith what was going on in memory.\n\n75\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.260\nAnd so we are able to capture in\nan offline way, the dynamic volatile data\n\n76\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.850\nas part of an imaging process today\nwith these virtual environments,\n\n77\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.370\nthese cloud based environments more and\nmore.\n\n78\n00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.050\nBut we have to understand the logic\nof that and how it works.\n\n79\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.790\nThat is a very different approach than\nwhat we've traditionally talked about.\n\n80\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.380\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n81\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.550\nMaintaining a log of all actions\nconducted on the machine.\n\n82\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.960\nWe've talked about the value of that.\n\n83\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.600\nPhotographing the screen of the running\nsystem to document its date.\n\n84\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.610\nA lot of times people kind\nof underestimate this.\n\n85\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.660\nHow do we capture stuff?\n\n86\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.740\nWell, I can just write down what I did.\n\n87\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.410\nI can say by calling Daniel over,\nhey do you see that yet?\n\n88\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.250\nYeah?\nOkay that's good.\n\n89\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.098\nYou'll remember that, right?\n\n90\n00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\nIt's right down in the notes.\n\n91\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.560\nAnd then six months Daniel's like\nI don't even know who you are,\n\n92\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.430\nwhat are you talking about.\n\n93\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.290\n&gt;&gt; You'll be wondering, like Mary Pennier\nwho has that perfect memory,\n\n94\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.460\nwould that be admissible in court?\n\n95\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.100\nThat's too bad.\n\n96\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.700\nI mean they.\n\n97\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.120\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you look, not any more,\nany less anybody else.\n\n98\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In other words,\n\n99\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.540\nyou know what I'm suggesting\nis when I say mm-mm.\n\n100\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.494\nYou may not have heard me,\nlet me [CROSSTALK]\n\n101\n00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:30.902\n&gt;&gt; I heard you sai uh-uh like,\n\n102\n00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:32.186\n&gt;&gt; Uh-uh, essentially no, right.\n\n103\n00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:34.060\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I'm suggesting though\n\n104\n00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.040\nis that it's not any more or any less, I\nmean admissible in any body else's memory.\n\n105\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.080\nWe treat memories as if\nthey are first person.\n\n106\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.030\nIf you say to me,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n107\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.060\n&gt;&gt; You Adam, six months ago, you and\nI had this conversation, and\n\n108\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.360\ndo you remember that?\n\n109\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.300\nI mean, that may or may not be admissible\ndepending on a lot of circumstances.\n\n110\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.629\nIf I say as an expert witness, I'm on\nthe stand let's say, and you're asking me\n\n111\n00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.160\nquestions about what I found when I\ninvestigated six months ago, I can\n\n112\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.710\nactually referring to my notes, in certain\ncircumstance, again, broad conversation.\n\n113\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.560\nBut I may be able to refer to my notes,\nsee that I can refer to my notes\n\n114\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.300\nspecific to that event, and\nI can recall details from the notes.\n\n115\n00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.870\nAnd that would be considered admissible\nbecause it is an investigator\n\n116\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.790\ngiving the benefit of their experience and\nusing notes to ensure they get it correct.\n\n117\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.700\nBut those notes have to be submitted as\npart of the evidence that is offered at\n\n118\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.990\ntrial, and the veracity,\nyour value of them could be challenged.\n\n119\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.890\nHey, these notes are not in the same form\nand same process style as all the others.\n\n120\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.395\nThe prosecutor may say hey\nyour notes are invalid.\n\n121\n00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.461\nThere's always things that can go on.\n\n122\n00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:34.605\nBut we are allowed to actually refer\nto our notes in certain cases.\n\n123\n00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:35.997\nSo it does depend.\n\n124\n00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:38.077\nIt is circumstantial,\nbut an average person,\n\n125\n00:05:38.077 --> 00:05:40.005\nwe certainly offer testimony all the time.\n\n126\n00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.941\nYou see it in TV and movies,\nfirst party witnesses,\n\n127\n00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:47.282\npeople that are direct witnesses are\ncalled to testify base on their memory,\n\n128\n00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:49.320\ntheir recollection of the events.\n\n129\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.520\nIt's no less or\nmore relevant than anybody else's.\n\n130\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.170\nBut that challenge is always\noffered to the testimony.\n\n131\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.320\nWell we can prove that you\ndid not remember that.\n\n132\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.345\nYou said it was a dark night,\nhow could you have seen,\n\n133\n00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:00.967\nyou didn't have your glasses on, right.\n\n134\n00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:02.790\nYou're wearing glasses\nhere today in court.\n\n135\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.850\nDid you have them on that night?\n\n136\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.670\nNo, I did not.\n\n137\n00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.760\nHow could you have seen 50 yards away and\nwith perfect clarity and\n\n138\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.110\nperfect certainty identify that Taylor was\nthe person who threw the egg or whatever.\n\n139\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.570\nThat's kind of something\nthat goes on all the time.\n\n140\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n141\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.900\n&gt;&gt; It would be hard to say for sure.\n\n142\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.470\nIdentify the OS that's running\non the suspect machine.\n\n143\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.180\nThere's a lot of ways to identify the OS,\nfor instance, in Windows, right?\n\n144\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.170\nRunning this here,\n\n145\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.205\nwe may be able to do something as\nsimple as issue the winver command.\n\n146\n00:06:30.205 --> 00:06:31.410\nW-I-N-V-E-R.\n\n147\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.340\nI just did that.\n\n148\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.300\nThat does bring up and\ntell us what version of the OS is running.\n\n149\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.970\nIf there is a service pack involved,\nwe may see that.\n\n150\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.680\nWe may see some, depending on what version\nof Windows going back to Windows 7,\n\n151\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.210\nwe would see the service pack level,\nwe may not see that in newer versions but\n\n152\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.740\nwe can certainly ascertain that.\n\n153\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.882\nNow, can we read that from the registry\nand get registry keys to tell us that?\n\n154\n00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:53.520\nAbsolutely, and some of the upcoming\nconversations around operating system\n\n155\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.227\nforensics got just list after list,\n\n156\n00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:58.641\nline after line of register keys that\nwill give you as reference points for\n\n157\n00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.750\nall of the things that go on in\nWindows and the equivalent, right?\n\n158\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.960\nFor log files and things like that\nin the Mac and the Linux world and\n\n159\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.200\nthere's register keys that will tell\nus all of this in the Windows world,\n\n160\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.420\nwe just gotta know where to look.\n\n161\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.120\nIdentify the OS running\non the suspect machine.\n\n162\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.170\nNote system date and time, if possible,\ncorrelate that with correct and\n\n163\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.490\naccurate time.\n\n164\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.160\nCheck the system for\nthe use of whole disk or\n\n165\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.000\nfile encryption,\nreally important to know about this.\n\n166\n00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.840\nWe have to check and find out whether or\nnot the drive has been encrypted.\n\n167\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.064\nAnd if it is, is it encrypted with\nsomething like BitLocker in Windows, whole\n\n168\n00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:32.460\ndisk instance encryption, or are we doing\njust file level encryption such as EFS?\n\n169\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.160\nEFS is very different cuz it encrypts\nat the file level not at the disk or\n\n170\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.230\nthe volume level.\n\n171\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.870\nSo we do need to be aware of that.\n\n172\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.040\nIf we can go to full screen just for\n\n173\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.150\nthe last couple there because\nI'm kinda covering them,\n\n174\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.100\ndo not use administrative\nutilities during an investigation.\n\n175\n00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.300\nYou may modify the system, we've talked\na lot about this very important.\n\n176\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.896\nUse caution even when\nrunning diagnostic utilities.\n\n177\n00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:52.366\nSomething as simple as\ncheck disk to check for\n\n178\n00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:56.981\nbad sectors could cause problems because\nyou would change the layout of information\n\n179\n00:07:56.981 --> 00:08:01.271\non the allocation of information on the\ndrive, if you run that tool In a way that\n\n180\n00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:05.171\nit's allowed to fix the actual bad\nsectors or attempt to recover them.\n\n181\n00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:09.632\nYou'll modify the data and in so doing,\nruin the forensic integrity of that\n\n182\n00:08:09.632 --> 00:08:12.500\nsystem, you cannot do that,\nthat would be bad.\n\n183\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would not be good.\n\n184\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Not be good.\n\n185\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.990\n&gt;&gt; Not be good.\n\n186\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.490\nSo you gotta be careful with that, right?\n\n187\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.920\nBut can you run that\nagainst an offline copy,\n\n188\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.940\na forensically copy of\nthe image after the fact?\n\n189\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.530\nYeah, you could if you wanna recover that.\n\n190\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.520\nBut you're probably not gonna run check\ndisk, you're gonna run other tools.\n\n191\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.136\nWin hex,\nlike we talked about a hex editor.\n\n192\n00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:28.810\nOne of the image viewers.\n\n193\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.800\nAn NTFS file viewer or\nNTFS partition viewer.\n\n194\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.560\nI'll demo a couple of those in\nthe upcoming hands on piece\n\n195\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.550\nassociated with this set of shows,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n196\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.520\nSo there's different\nways you could do this.\n\n197\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.460\nDumping the RAM from the system\ninto a forensically sound, and\n\n198\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.410\nsterile removable storage device.\n\n199\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.270\nCollecting other volatile OS\ndata as we've talked about and\n\n200\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.370\nthen fully documenting\neverything you are doing.\n\n201\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.280\nThis is the process that we're engaging\nthat is doing live data collection.\n\n202\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.530\nRemember this is the methodology\nassociated with live or dynamic or\n\n203\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.770\nvolatile data.\n\n204\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.660\nWe have the same thought process that\nwe have to engage around static data\n\n205\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.640\ncollection, because we are gonna\nhave a need to do that.\n\n206\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.150\nBut we often are thinking, at that point,\nand we've talked about this.\n\n207\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.950\nMaking the Bit Stream back up,\n\n208\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.360\nthe friends we sound copy,\nversus just the generic standard back up.\n\n209\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.130\nRemember a back up of the system using\nNT back up, back up exec Arcserve,\n\n210\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.520\nwhatever you're using, it doesn't matter.\n\n211\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.483\nThere's all these programs out there.\n\n212\n00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:26.790\nBut whatever you use, a backup\nactually modifies file attributes.\n\n213\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.500\nIt changes the backup flag, or\nthe attribute flag, on the file.\n\n214\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.770\nIt does access the file, so it changes\nfile date and time and access stamps.\n\n215\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.350\nBackups are in other words are going\nto be inherently destructive\n\n216\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.790\nfrom the forensic standpoint.\n\n217\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.510\nNot because they modify the data, but\nthey modify the data about the data,\n\n218\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.730\nthe metadata, and\nthe attributes around the use of the data.\n\n219\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.850\nThat's not considered a forensic\nactually sound methodology.\n\n220\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.150\nWe need to make copies in\na way that does not modify.\n\n221\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.300\nThat is we have to understand that.\n\n222\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.510\nWe will do bit extreme copies of either\nimage or disc, we could create an image.\n\n223\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.350\nUsing a tool like dd to create and\nimage or raw image file.\n\n224\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.400\nWe made you what you a disc just a disc,\ncopy or clone.\n\n225\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.210\nYou saw this one of the other tools that I\nwas demoing in the prior episode where we\n\n226\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.680\nhad out of option and we do and exercise\nit but, we could've cloned the disc.\n\n227\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.230\nRight?\nAs opposed to just loading an image and\n\n228\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.580\nlooking at that and that's something\nwe have to be aware of, as well.\n\n229\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.850\nSo, we do have a methodology\nassociated with that.\n\n230\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.980\nAnd we also have a methodology\nassociated with data acquisition and\n\n231\n00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.570\nthe idea of duplication.\n\n232\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.130\nAnd so you could see here that\nwe have to go through and\n\n233\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.280\nreally prepare for\ndata acquisition and duplication.\n\n234\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.890\nThis is really what we call, what I\nlabeled there, the frist proactive step in\n\n235\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.550\nthe investigative process cuz this is\nwhere we are grabbing that evidence\n\n236\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.910\nIn a forensically sound way making it\navailable for offline analysis and\n\n237\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.850\nfor use.\n\n238\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.140\nThe aim of Data Acquisition or\nforensically sound Data Acquisition there\n\n239\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.180\ncan make that copy and provide that\npotentially as evidence down the road.\n\n240\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.350\nAnd we have to keep coming back to that\nand, stressing that, it's very important.\n\n241\n00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.940\nNow one of the things I wanted to talk\nabout was sanitizing the target media.\n\n242\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.820\nThis actually here should be.\n\n243\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.540\nWe've noted this in the other place\nin the notes, but should be R 1,\n\n244\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.100\nthe document was updated\nnot that long ago.\n\n245\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.370\nBut long ago enough that I\nshould have known better and\n\n246\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.630\njust forgot to put revision one on there.\n\n247\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.384\nBut NIST SP 888.\n\n248\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.847\nThis document right here, is one of the\nreferenced documents that as a forensic\n\n249\n00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:16.106\ninvestigator, you would\nhopefully be familiar with.\n\n250\n00:11:16.106 --> 00:11:18.260\nAnd would most likely want to look at.\n\n251\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.740\nIt gives us guidelines for how to sanitize\nmedia, making it forensically sound, and\n\n252\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.530\navailable for use.\n\n253\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.000\nIn other words, how do we take some sort\nof a removable drive, whatever it is, and\n\n254\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.060\nhow do we sanitize it, how do we sterilize\nit so it has nothing remnant on there.\n\n255\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.390\nIt is clean and forensically sound for\nus to receive the data into and\n\n256\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.865\nhave a working power.\n\n257\n00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:41.145\nThat we can then forensically certify,\nis going to be acceptable,\n\n258\n00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:43.855\nso we can maintain one or\nmore images there.\n\n259\n00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:48.735\nThat's not just say buy a hard drive off\nof Ebay, plug it in and hope it works.\n\n260\n00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:51.640\nWe've got stuff we've actually got\nto do and do a certain way here.\n\n261\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.700\nEither we're sanitizing the drive by\nperhaps degaussing or going through a low\n\n262\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.420\nlevel format, or using in the case of\ncertain kinds of drives like an SSD drive,\n\n263\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.110\nvendor tools that are resetting a low\nlevel format on the drive wiping out data.\n\n264\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.110\nThere are commands that\ncould be used to do that.\n\n265\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.570\nWe have to know what those things are,\n\n266\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.090\nso reading a guide like\nthis would be helpful.\n\n267\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.110\nAnd you can see if you scroll through\nfirst couple of pages here to the Table of\n\n268\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.300\nContents, Just giving us the background,\nthis documents always doing that.\n\n269\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.710\nSome trends in storage media,\ntrends in sanitzation,\n\n270\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.560\ntypes of sanitzation,\nprobably important to be aware of that.\n\n271\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.840\nUse of cryptography, and\ncryptographic erase, right?\n\n272\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.460\nConsiderations around that.\n\n273\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.850\nWho should do this, what are the roles\ninvolved, who are the information\n\n274\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.650\nsalinization and disposition makers,\nwho do we go to in other words, right?\n\n275\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.600\nAnd how will they do that,\n\n276\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.070\nwhat are the salinization\ntechniques that may be appropriate?\n\n277\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.470\nAnd then we have a list of\nthings like tools and resources.\n\n278\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.400\nSo if you jump to page 24,\nyou'll see that we have just so\n\n279\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.560\nyou know, zoom in a little bit.\n\n280\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.660\nWe have the ability to do things\nlike clearing versus purging, right?\n\n281\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.820\nVersus destroying, this are the three\nmethods traditionally they're used and\n\n282\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.810\ninformation about them.\n\n283\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.620\nThere are some minimum sanitization\nrequirements, that are available.\n\n284\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.020\nRemember these documents are traditionally\nwritten for the ability of the government,\n\n285\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.180\nthe military, the US, but\n\n286\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.340\nbroadly governments around the world\nto be able in implement, and so\n\n287\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.040\nthis may not be something that in your\nprivate world that a small company might\n\n288\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.490\nmake as much sense, but the logic is what\nwe do when we extrapolate from and apply.\n\n289\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.670\nSo just showing you right, the idea here,\nfor hard copy storage like paper and\n\n290\n00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.130\nmicroform, when was the last\ntime you saw microform?\n\n291\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.150\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't tell you when.\n\n292\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.240\n&gt;&gt; So then again it's probably the last\ntime you actually set foot in a library,\n\n293\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.540\nin the sense that you tend to\nsee those things in libraries,\n\n294\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.060\nunless you go to a fixed\nlibrary as opposed to\n\n295\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.670\nonline today you may not even\nsee those things anymore right.\n\n296\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.560\nBut you'll see here if we're focusing\non just as a case study example\n\n297\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.360\nfocusing on something like paper.\n\n298\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.540\nIt says you don't clear or\npurge you destroy right?\n\n299\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.770\nDestroy paper using cross cut shredders\nwith such and such requirements.\n\n300\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.300\nDestroy microfilm, microform,\nmicrofiche etcetera by burning.\n\n301\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.830\nSo you don't shred that stuff because\nit will be put back together again.\n\n302\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.890\nYou burn it, right?\n\n303\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.120\nWhen material is burned the residue\nmust be reduced to white ash.\n\n304\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.060\nAnd not just enough to burn it.\n\n305\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.060\nYou gotta make sure you burn it and\nleave no residue, right?\n\n306\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.510\nSo it's very prescriptive.\n\n307\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.020\nAnd this is the kind of guidance,\n\n308\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.900\nthat would help us as investigators to\nunderstand what to do and what not to do,\n\n309\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.810\nand then obviously to then utilize\nthis knowledge to prepare.\n\n310\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.360\nNot because we're gonna destroy paper,\nbut rather to sanitize media.\n\n311\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.460\nIf we get into things here,\nyou see below there's networking devices.\n\n312\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.880\nThen you go further down.\n\n313\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.630\nApple iPhones and iPads,\nmobile devices, right.\n\n314\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.680\nBlackberries.\n\n315\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.150\nNear and dear to my heart, right.\n\n316\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.680\nDevices running the Google Android OS.\n\n317\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.850\nRight?\nWindows phones,\n\n318\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.640\ndon't see too many of those anymore,\nright?\n\n319\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.930\nAll other mobile devices,\nwhatever they may be.\n\n320\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.230\nAnd then office equipment.\n\n321\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.800\nBut eventually if you go down,\nmagnetic media.\n\n322\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.610\nThis is what we're talking about, right?\n\n323\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.598\nNot necessarily floppy's\nby magnetic disks.\n\n324\n00:14:45.598 --> 00:14:48.530\nWe're looking at hard drives,\nthings like that.\n\n325\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.930\nTapes if you're doing tapes.\n\n326\n00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.690\nAlthough most people\ndon't use tapes anymore.\n\n327\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.280\nSo we get into the hard drives here.\n\n328\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.860\nThis is where we start\ngetting into guidance,\n\n329\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.980\nthat for us will be specific\nabout how do we mount and\n\n330\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.240\nuse hard drives that are cleared or\nare purged or destroyed.\n\n331\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.520\nNot destroyed, obviously,\nbut cleared or purged so\n\n332\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.560\nthat we can know that we are using them\nin a way that is forensically sound.\n\n333\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.740\nThere's no remnant in data or\nresidue before we start writing them.\n\n334\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.420\nWe'd wanna follow guidance that's in this\ndocument specifically in order to do that.\n\n335\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.690\nSo it is important for you to go in and\nlook at this kind of stuff, right.\n\n336\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.510\nThese are the guidelines and\n\n337\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:24.190\nthe basic set of operational rules\nthat investigators will often rely on.\n\n338\n00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.055\nPreparing a chain of custody document,\nwe've talked extensively about that.\n\n339\n00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:29.575\nIn some prior episodes showed\nyou some sample copies\n\n340\n00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:30.835\nof chain of custody documents.\n\n341\n00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:32.915\nIf you haven't seen those,\ngo back take a look.\n\n342\n00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:34.595\nI think we actually included\nthose in the show notes.\n\n343\n00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:37.395\nSo you would be able to actually\nget a copy of a couple of\n\n344\n00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.775\nthose templates we used to\nshow you what they look like.\n\n345\n00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:42.675\nDetermine the best acquisition method,\nenable right protection and\n\n346\n00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:43.635\nall, the evidence.\n\n347\n00:15:43.635 --> 00:15:46.445\nRemember years ago on floppy\ndisks you used to have to\n\n348\n00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.640\npush the a little notch over.\n\n349\n00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.920\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a little slider over.\n\n350\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nDepending on what it was,\n\n351\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.350\nto be able to write protect it so\nyou couldn't write over it.\n\n352\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.834\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or you would tape it over if somebody\n\n353\n00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:56.295\nbroke it off so you could use it or not.\n\n354\n00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:59.116\nDuct tape is just like the most\namazing thing in the world.\n\n355\n00:15:59.116 --> 00:16:03.102\n&gt;&gt; It was funny, it was back when VHS\ntape was popular, it had The notch.\n\n356\n00:16:03.102 --> 00:16:06.085\n&gt;&gt; The tab, right, you break it off,\nor you have to tape over it.\n\n357\n00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:07.443\n&gt;&gt; Or you cover a piece of tape on it.\n\n358\n00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:09.555\n&gt;&gt; To be able to use it if\nsomeone had it broken off.\n\n359\n00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:10.743\nBecause you think,\nI'll never need that again.\n\n360\n00:16:10.743 --> 00:16:11.962\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'll break it off, and\n\n361\n00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:13.580\nthen you decide you want to write over it,\nand\n\n362\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.083\nyou gotta put a piece\nof tape back over it.\n\n363\n00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:17.490\nYeah, I still have a couple\nof those floating around.\n\n364\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.613\nActually, our whole Barney collection.\n\n365\n00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:19.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what it\n\n366\n00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:20.035\nis at some point.\n\n367\n00:16:20.035 --> 00:16:24.053\nBecause my oldest is old enough now,\nthat when she was young,\n\n368\n00:16:24.053 --> 00:16:26.616\nVHS was still pretty much the way to go.\n\n369\n00:16:26.616 --> 00:16:31.472\nAnd so all the Barney tapes and\nall the, what the heck were they?\n\n370\n00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:33.647\nNot just the Baby Einstein tapes,\nwhich also we did.\n\n371\n00:16:33.647 --> 00:16:35.654\nBut there was the other one,\n\n372\n00:16:35.654 --> 00:16:39.925\nthe British one with all\nthe crazy psychedelic characters.\n\n373\n00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:40.517\n&gt;&gt; Was it Teletubbies?\n\n374\n00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:41.804\n&gt;&gt; Teletubbies, there you go.\n\n375\n00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:42.965\n&gt;&gt; Teletubbies.\n\n376\n00:16:42.965 --> 00:16:45.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, boy that was just, yeah.\n\n377\n00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.011\n&gt;&gt; That's brutal.\n&gt;&gt; Pure nightmare fuel, right there.\n\n378\n00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:48.866\n&gt;&gt; Brutal as a parent, let me tell you.\n\n379\n00:16:48.866 --> 00:16:50.296\nNever want to see another purple\ndinosaur as long as I live.\n\n380\n00:16:50.296 --> 00:16:51.787\n&gt;&gt; No you don't, no you don't.\n\n381\n00:16:51.787 --> 00:16:55.390\n&gt;&gt; So inevitably, write protection\ndetermining that acquisition format.\n\n382\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.705\nAre we going to acquire using a DD image,\nor are we gonna use another image type?\n\n383\n00:16:58.705 --> 00:17:00.210\nThere's all these\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n384\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.162\nData acquisition tools\nhave to be selected.\n\n385\n00:17:02.162 --> 00:17:04.080\nWe have to plan for contingencies.\n\n386\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.460\nWhat happens when we go to do something,\nit doesn't work the right way?\n\n387\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.700\nWhat happens when something goes wrong,\n\n388\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.070\nwhat happens when we need something,\nand we don't have it?\n\n389\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.164\nWe may be in a situation,\n\n390\n00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:14.724\nin a place, where we can't just run down\nto the store and get something, right?\n\n391\n00:17:14.724 --> 00:17:16.360\nSo we gotta have a back up plan.\n\n392\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.220\nBecause not everybody carries lithium\nion batteries for mobile devices, right?\n\n393\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.300\nJust that kind of stuff, or power bricks,\nor things like that, may not happen.\n\n394\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.600\nI travel overseas a lot.\n\n395\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.015\nI gotta travel with extra adapters,\nbecause you might have situations where\n\n396\n00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:31.200\nI've actually broken or something,\nit's happened to a power brick.\n\n397\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.951\nAnd you can't just get one.\n\n398\n00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.634\nI mean today in theory with Amazon,\n\n399\n00:17:34.634 --> 00:17:36.991\nyou probably could get one\nrelatively quickly but\n\n400\n00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:39.728\nif you need one tomorrow morning and it's-\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna happen.\n\n401\n00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:40.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just not,\n\n402\n00:17:40.422 --> 00:17:42.320\nunless the hotel happens to have one,\nit's not gonna happen.\n\n403\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.030\n&gt;&gt; It reminded me of back to\nthe Future when Doc Brown says,\n\n404\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.920\nI'm sure in 1985 plutonium is\navailable at every corner drug store.\n\n405\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.822\nBut in 1955,\nit's a little hard to come by.\n\n406\n00:17:50.822 --> 00:17:53.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or he also has, later on.\n\n407\n00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.554\nHe pulls out the,\n\n408\n00:17:54.554 --> 00:17:58.945\nwhere they're on the dirt road there by\nwhere they're gonna build the housing.\n\n409\n00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And he pulls out the briefcase with all\n\n410\n00:18:00.189 --> 00:18:02.002\nthe money from the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all the different eras, yeah.\n\n411\n00:18:02.002 --> 00:18:03.354\n&gt;&gt; He's like, no, you wait, here.\n\n412\n00:18:03.354 --> 00:18:04.260\nHere's some cash.\n\n413\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.960\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of this.\n\n414\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n415\n00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.810\nSo it's one of those things,\nyou gotta plan.\n\n416\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.780\nBoy Scouts motto, right?\n\n417\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.800\nPlan to be plan.\n\n418\n00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.310\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, always be prepared.\n\n419\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.340\nPlan to be successful.\n\n420\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.260\nSo acquire the data,\nvalidate the data acquisition.\n\n421\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.849\nRemember, validation when involved things\nlike doing a hash, doing comparison.\n\n422\n00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.615\nMaybe doing a bitstream copy and\n\n423\n00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:26.020\nthen doing a validation through the copy\nwhere we actually go back through.\n\n424\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.410\nAre the hard drives going\nto be the same size?\n\n425\n00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.576\nWe looked at things like image stat,\nright, as part of the TSK,\n\n426\n00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:34.509\nthe Sleuth Toolkit,\nwhere we actually were able to go in and\n\n427\n00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:37.876\nlook at the size of the drive of\nthe image type and then compare them.\n\n428\n00:18:37.876 --> 00:18:39.883\nJust different ways we could\nvalidate the acquisition.\n\n429\n00:18:39.883 --> 00:18:43.759\nBut we do need to be aware of the fact\nthat these kind of things will happen, or\n\n430\n00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:46.430\nthat we do need to make\nsure we are aware of them.\n\n431\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.900\nAnd just validating that and\nthinking about that.\n\n432\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.440\nTerms of data acquisition formats, we're\ntalking about data acquisition format, so\n\n433\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.060\nlet's drill into item number five here for\njust a minute.\n\n434\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.020\nHave a list of some of the formats,\nwe talked about the three states\n\n435\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.430\nthat we could use for sanitization clear,\npurge, and destroy, showed you all that.\n\n436\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.380\nBut data acquisition formats, let's just\ngo ahead and let's take a look here.\n\n437\n00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.310\nWe've got raw, right?\n\n438\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.480\nUnderstood by everything, essentially,\n\n439\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.080\nraw is like the HP print driver of\nthe data acquisition format world.\n\n440\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.330\nIt will work with anything, right,\nproprietary by tool vendors.\n\n441\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.070\nAs I said, lots of vendors will\nhave their own standards, and so\n\n442\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.530\nit really just depends on\nwhat the vendor is doing.\n\n443\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.617\nIf you're using you know an Acme corp\ndata acquisition tool, and that's their\n\n444\n00:19:24.617 --> 00:19:29.345\nspecific proprietary type, that's what\nyou're stuck with, that's what you use.\n\n445\n00:19:29.345 --> 00:19:34.580\nAdvanced Forensics Format, AFF, also\nAFF 4, kind of a newer version of that.\n\n446\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.410\nAFF is open source.\n\n447\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.350\nIt does include .afm for AFF metadata and\n.afd for segment and image files.\n\n448\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.910\nWe do support a couple of different\ncompression formats there,\n\n449\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.150\nzlib, which you may be familiar with.\n\n450\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.562\nIn the sense, on Linux, Unix, and\n\n451\n00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:48.300\nsome of those-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n452\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.380\n&gt;&gt; You may see that.\n\n453\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.730\nLZMA, you may see that although,\nyou may not think of that.\n\n454\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.900\nBut we do support the compression formats.\n\n455\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:59.959\nAFF4, kind of a newer version of Advanced\nForensics Framework updated, if you will.\n\n456\n00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:03.000\nThis supports image signing cryptography,\nit's a newer standard,\n\n457\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.972\nhas a focus more on the security and\nthe integrity aspects of the image.\n\n458\n00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:10.120\nThe downside, the one thing that a lot of\ntimes you will hear people complain about\n\n459\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.490\nwith AFF, is that you can't validate\nthe images at a certain level,\n\n460\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.050\nbecause there's no security associated\nwith it natively in the stack.\n\n461\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.330\nYou have to do it separately.\n\n462\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.110\nAnd in this way with AFF4 we build\nin image signing and cryptography.\n\n463\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.092\nWe have a global reference identifier.\n\n464\n00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:27.300\nUUID, GUID kind of concept that\nallows us to be able to refer,\n\n465\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.080\nand therefore uniquely identify all\nevidence as we build our case file.\n\n466\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.170\nIt's a little bit more logical and more\nwith it with what we do and expect today.\n\n467\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.500\nSuch as something that we will often use.\n\n468\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.550\nWe then have the Generic Forensic Zip\nfile format, or gfzip.\n\n469\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.565\nAnother standard one, open file format.\n\n470\n00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:47.890\nAllows for, as you can see there,\ncompressed forensic complete and\n\n471\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.670\nsigned disk image files.\n\n472\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.630\nMost tools,\nrather this provides a set of tools and\n\n473\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.510\nlibraries that most systems can work with.\n\n474\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.460\nSo we do traditionally see this as well.\n\n475\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.400\nIf you're doing on the zoom,\nrather not zoom up at all, scroll up so\n\n476\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.310\nyou can see this.\n\n477\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.780\nIf you're using a compressed and\nnon-sequential storage,\n\n478\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.755\nthen this is something that would be good,\nthe gfzip file format is good for this.\n\n479\n00:21:07.755 --> 00:21:11.275\nNon-sequential means data that may\nbe scattered in different places on\n\n480\n00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:13.240\nthe platter or on the disk image.\n\n481\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.380\nNot sequentially written,\nremember maybe literally sprinkled around\n\n482\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.530\nin different places,\nthen gfzip may be a good format for you.\n\n483\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.593\nSo, probably a good idea just to\nhave a sense of this and be aware of\n\n484\n00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:27.294\nthe different file formats or the\ndifferent acquisition formats that we see.\n\n485\n00:21:27.294 --> 00:21:30.815\nThere are five, maybe one or\ntwo testable questions I think,\n\n486\n00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:33.720\nperhaps floating around\nin there somewhere.\n\n487\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.915\nWe do have the need to think about\nwhat kind of tools we'll use.\n\n488\n00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:40.890\nAre there mandatory, requirements of\ntools, we'll need the answers absolutely.\n\n489\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:41.950\nWe've got some here.\n\n490\n00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.350\nLet's just take a look at what they are.\n\n491\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.400\nThe data acquisition tools and the things\nwe do, could we just full screen just so\n\n492\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.730\nwe could see this a little bit easier?\n\n493\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.840\nThere we go, just easier than me having\nto scroll up and down all the time.\n\n494\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.060\nSo, I would say that all the tools that\nwe wanna use should meet this list of\n\n495\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:56.960\nrequirements.\n\n496\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.180\nThey must not alter or make any changes,\nwe've talked a lot about this.\n\n497\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.670\nThey must log any I/O\nerrors in an accessible and\n\n498\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.570\nreadable form, including things\nlike type and location there.\n\n499\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.100\nThe one thing you hate is when you\nget these nondescript error codes,\n\n500\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.200\nI couldn't copy something.\n\n501\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.470\nWell, what couldn't you copy?\n\n502\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.770\nWhere couldn't you copy it to and\nwhy couldn't you copy it?\n\n503\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.716\nI just couldn't copy it.\n\n504\n00:22:13.716 --> 00:22:14.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n505\n00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:15.070\nthank you very much-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big help.\n\n506\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.210\n&gt;&gt; For the nondescript,\ntotally useless information, right?\n\n507\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.005\nThank you, Microsoft,\nas we would say, right?\n\n508\n00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The tool must be able to compare and\n\n509\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.440\nsource, to compare the source and\ndestination and\n\n510\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.890\nalert user if one is\nsmaller than the other.\n\n511\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.800\nAlso a big oops and gotcha.\n\n512\n00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.525\nHey, we're copying a terabyte of data\ninto a space that's half that size.\n\n513\n00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:32.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n514\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.010\nwe're gonna fail halfway through,\nand we didn't realize that.\n\n515\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.740\nWould be nice if the tool did a quick\ncomparison before we started since I'm\n\n516\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.480\njust thinking, we got a lot of stuff here,\nand we don't have a lot of room over here.\n\n517\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.880\nAnd that's probably not\ngonna work too well.\n\n518\n00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.680\n&gt;&gt; Not the best mathematician\nin the world, but-\n\n519\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.224\n&gt;&gt; Maybe wanna think about doing something\n\n520\n00:22:47.224 --> 00:22:48.046\ndifferent, right?\n\n521\n00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:49.540\nSo again-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n522\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.276\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying, there's good UI,\n\n523\n00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:55.147\ngood application code, and then there's\njust stuff that just does not make sense.\n\n524\n00:22:55.147 --> 00:22:57.646\n&gt;&gt; There's someone that\nwas hating their life.\n\n525\n00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.347\n&gt;&gt; And they said I'm just\ngonna get this puppy out,\n\n526\n00:22:59.347 --> 00:23:00.685\nregardless of what happens, right?\n\n527\n00:23:00.685 --> 00:23:03.582\nAll right, so the tool must have\nthe ability to pass scientific and\n\n528\n00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:07.110\npeer review, meaning it's gotta be\ncertified, right, and validated.\n\n529\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.360\nTypically, if you're using vendor-driven\ntools that are in the market that\n\n530\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.900\nhave a good reputation.\n\n531\n00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.195\nIf you're using this black box, open\nsource, I'm not suggesting for a minute,\n\n532\n00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:16.978\nby the way,\nthat open source tools are bad.\n\n533\n00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:21.038\nThis morning, I've been using this black\nbox open source tool that only two people\n\n534\n00:23:21.038 --> 00:23:22.260\non the planet have used.\n\n535\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.480\nYou and the guy who created it right?\n\n536\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.750\nIt may not be the proper\nchoice in certain situations.\n\n537\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.430\nIt's not because it\ndoesn't do a great job.\n\n538\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.220\nIt probably does a wonderful job but\n\n539\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.520\nit just may not have been\nvetted enough to be accepted.\n\n540\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.050\nIt's not that I'm saying that the job\nthat's it's gonna do is gonna put you\n\n541\n00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.460\nin a position where the evidence is\nnot gonna be forensically sound.\n\n542\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.170\nWhat I'm suggesting is, when you show up\nto testify, six, eight months later and\n\n543\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.876\none of the things that gets\nchallenged is your methodology.\n\n544\n00:23:45.876 --> 00:23:48.876\nAnd the other thing in there will be,\nhey, you did this, this, this,\n\n545\n00:23:48.876 --> 00:23:51.942\nthis way with these tools, wait a second,\nwhat the heck is this tool?\n\n546\n00:23:51.942 --> 00:23:52.769\nRemember, nobody's heard of this before.\n\n547\n00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:57.133\nHow do we know the image you created and\nthe data you found is forensically sound?\n\n548\n00:23:57.133 --> 00:24:00.156\nAnd now we're gonna have\nto spend an entire day,\n\n549\n00:24:00.156 --> 00:24:05.112\nright, fending off these challenges,\njust to establish what we did as right.\n\n550\n00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:07.333\nVersus using a tool that\neverybody can look at and\n\n551\n00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:11.181\ngo, yeah, there's no way that if they use\nthat tool that they didn't find forensic\n\n552\n00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:15.120\nevidence using a proper methodology cuz\neverybody in the world uses that tool.\n\n553\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.410\nSo we just gotta make choices that\nare smart, is what I'm suggesting there.\n\n554\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.930\nAnd tools that have been vetted and\nthat have a history and\n\n555\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.700\ntherefore have been through this before.\n\n556\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.970\nAs Daniel said, not my first rodeo, right?\n\n557\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.440\nThe reason almost everybody on the planet\nthat does forensic views is n case or\n\n558\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.400\nuses paraben is because those tools have\nbeen through thousands, tens of thousands,\n\n559\n00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.630\nof trials in terms of being the tool\nset in the evidence provider.\n\n560\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.186\nAnd not that they're not challenged,\nbecause somebody could use them\n\n561\n00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:46.921\nincorrectly, but the fact that you use\nthat tool and follow a standardized\n\n562\n00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:50.785\nmethodology is gonna leave a lot less\non the table for somebody to challenge.\n\n563\n00:24:50.785 --> 00:24:53.384\nThan a tool that may not have\nthat history and that degree or\n\n564\n00:24:53.384 --> 00:24:55.732\nthat pedigree behind it,\nis what I'm suggesting.\n\n565\n00:24:55.732 --> 00:24:57.987\nSo let's think about the logic of that,\nright?\n\n566\n00:24:57.987 --> 00:25:02.586\nSo you wanna have the Rolls Royce as\nopposed to the Yugo of the forensic tool.\n\n567\n00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.825\nCar world is what I'm perhaps getting at.\n\n568\n00:25:04.825 --> 00:25:06.915\n&gt;&gt; They both might get you\nto the same destination.\n\n569\n00:25:06.915 --> 00:25:09.467\n&gt;&gt; It's a matter of comfort and\nwhat you look like when you pull up.\n\n570\n00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:10.517\n[CROSSTALK] Yes, exactly.\n\n571\n00:25:10.517 --> 00:25:11.968\nRemember the Grey Poupon commercials\n\n572\n00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:12.807\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I loved them.\n\n573\n00:25:12.807 --> 00:25:15.015\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any Grey Poupon?\n\n574\n00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:17.934\nI would love to see one of those,\nthere probably is a meme on that,\n\n575\n00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:21.134\nwhere literally, somebody does that\nin a Trobotontory Yugo, right?\n\n576\n00:25:21.134 --> 00:25:23.631\nAnd you've got like, yes,\nI have it right here.\n\n577\n00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:27.820\nAll right, so anyway, the tool should\ncompletely acquire all visible,\n\n578\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.350\nas well as hidden data\nsector is very important.\n\n579\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.540\nTools should create a bit stream copy,\nas we talked about here,\n\n580\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.550\nthe original content.\n\n581\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.099\nWhen there are no errors in accessing, or\nbeing able to access, the source media.\n\n582\n00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:39.620\nShould create a qualified bit stream copy.\n\n583\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.590\nThis is important as well, right?\n\n584\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.620\nQualified copy means we're able to define\nand get the data, right, that was there.\n\n585\n00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.890\nDefine and get the data [LAUGH] that was\nthere when IO errors exist in accessing\n\n586\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.980\nthe source media.\n\n587\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.940\nWe should, in other words, still be able\nto create a copy, but it is a qualified\n\n588\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.410\ncopy, a copy that has three or four\nerrors associated with it or exceptions.\n\n589\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.630\nThey have to be noted, we actually saw\nthis at the end of the demo that I did\n\n590\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.320\nwhere we were setting up and\nshowing you Autopsy in Windows.\n\n591\n00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:07.850\nWhere we said hey,\n\n592\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.060\nwe're not gonna wait for the entire\nanalysis of the C drive to happen.\n\n593\n00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.340\nWe loaded the original data,\nwe started to see some data pop in, but\n\n594\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.088\nthe thing was at 0%, as I showed you.\n\n595\n00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:20.229\nAnd we were just starting that analysis,\nwe already found a bunch of stuff.\n\n596\n00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:23.489\nBut what you saw pop up there, I didn't\nreally mention it, so you may not assume,\n\n597\n00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:25.390\nyou may have to go back and\nlook to really see it.\n\n598\n00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.970\nBut what we saw pop up, at the bottom\nthere of the interface, was every so\n\n599\n00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.257\noften, there was an error in parsing\na file, or reading a hash, or\n\n600\n00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.280\ndoing comparison.\n\n601\n00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.236\nAnd it was keeping an error log of those,\nthere were nine of them by the time we got\n\n602\n00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:39.430\ndone with the demo and just said okay,\nwe're done, and we left it running.\n\n603\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.820\nAnd there's probably a whole bunch more,\nright,\n\n604\n00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.180\nif we go all the way through the C drive.\n\n605\n00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.960\nBecause some files are locked open,\nright, while we're capturing that.\n\n606\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.340\nBecause we're doing it from\na live copy of the C drive.\n\n607\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.935\nWe were running essentially against\nthe C drive of the system we were on.\n\n608\n00:26:51.935 --> 00:26:55.996\nThere are gonna be a whole bunch of files\nthat we could not forensically grab and\n\n609\n00:26:55.996 --> 00:27:00.115\nauthoritatively interact with and\nexamine, cuz they're locked open.\n\n610\n00:27:00.115 --> 00:27:02.885\nAnd as a result, they would throw\nerrors and we're expecting to see that,\n\n611\n00:27:02.885 --> 00:27:05.095\nso we gotta keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n612\n00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:08.760\nWe should be able to create qualified\ncopies, it's very important for\n\n613\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.866\nus to have that in mind and to understand\nthe file process associated with that.\n\n614\n00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:16.022\nAll right, so then what is\nthe static collection methodology?\n\n615\n00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:17.832\nSo we do have a multistep process here.\n\n616\n00:27:17.832 --> 00:27:20.981\nIf we can go back to full screen,\nwe'll take a look at this really quickly.\n\n617\n00:27:20.981 --> 00:27:25.301\nSo the process here, as opposed to\nthe dynamic collection methodology,\n\n618\n00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:29.101\nprepare chain of custody document\ntracking all collected information and\n\n619\n00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:31.491\npreserving the integrity\nof that information.\n\n620\n00:27:31.491 --> 00:27:35.231\nCalculate hash values of all the hard\ndrives and files that we will use.\n\n621\n00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:38.151\nWhether they are suspicious or\nnot, that doesn't really matter.\n\n622\n00:27:38.151 --> 00:27:41.691\nWhen I say suspicious, what I mean\nis all the drives we're examining,\n\n623\n00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:43.697\nwe're assuming have evidence on them.\n\n624\n00:27:43.697 --> 00:27:45.885\nHey, that's a funny looking\nsuspicious hard drive hanging out in\n\n625\n00:27:45.885 --> 00:27:46.680\nthe corner over there.\n\n626\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.550\nLet's go see what that guy's up to.\n\n627\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.990\nHe's hiding in the shadows and smoking,\nthat's probably not appropriate, right?\n\n628\n00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.590\nCreate a bit stream copy of\nthe hard drive or the file.\n\n629\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.090\nCalculate the hash values of all\nthe newly created files and,\n\n630\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.370\nor hard drive images that you capture.\n\n631\n00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.705\nNever, and we've talked about this,\nnever, ever, ever, right,\n\n632\n00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:04.181\nnever work with the original.\n\n633\n00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:07.976\nAlways work with the duplicates, and we've\ntalked a lot about this and why this is so\n\n634\n00:28:07.976 --> 00:28:09.640\nimportant as a methodology as well.\n\n635\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.940\nWanna keep this in mind, is to make sure\nwe're thinking through the logic of this\n\n636\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.450\nbecause, again, if we work on the\noriginal, we could run into a situation\n\n637\n00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.310\nwhere we may actually have a problem that\nwe could wind up destroying evidence.\n\n638\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.880\nAnd if we do, we may not have anything\nto show at the end of the day, and\n\n639\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.620\nthat's gonna be a bit of a challenge for\nus.\n\n640\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.210\nSo we do wanna sure we're aware of\nthat and thinking about that as well.\n\n641\n00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam,\n\n642\n00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.722\nI know that we have plenty of more to\ntalk about when it comes to this topic.\n\n643\n00:28:35.722 --> 00:28:38.650\nBut our clock over there is yelling and\nscreaming at us.\n\n644\n00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.540\nOnly we can hear it, so\nthat's why you don't hear that.\n\n645\n00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.363\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Silent scream.\n\n646\n00:28:41.363 --> 00:28:45.422\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're like dogs to the\nclock, and it emits a tone only Adam and\n\n647\n00:28:45.422 --> 00:28:46.910\nI can actually hear.\n\n648\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.110\nThat being said, we're going to have\nto roll this into a part three, so\n\n649\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.270\ndefinitely come back and join us for that.\n\n650\n00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.560\nLet's keep this conversation\nmoving along cuz it is good stuff.\n\n651\n00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.930\nAll right, everyone, thanks for watching.\n\n652\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.260\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n653\n00:29:00.260 -->

continuing\nnow with more on our CHFI version 9\n\n9\n00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:23.983\nseries.\n\n10\n00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:27.516\nSpecifically looking at data\nacquisition and duplication.\n\n11\n00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.828\nHere to tell us more about that topic,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:32.302\nAdam my man, how is it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:36.188\n&gt;&gt; it is going well, excited to be here,\nand actually to jump back in and\n\n14\n00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:39.145\ntalking about some tools of the trade,\nif you will.\n\n15\n00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:41.056\nWith regards to data acquisition,\nduplication.\n\n16\n00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:43.436\nWe demonstrated a few of the little\nones here and there for you.\n\n17\n00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:47.048\nGot some more interesting ones, actually\na whole list of them, for you and for\n\n18\n00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:47.991\nus to take a look at.\n\n19\n00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.299\nThere are so many options when we\nlook at examining data in a system.\n\n20\n00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.118\nAnd so many different ways to get to see\nthe data, whether it's Windows based,\n\n21\n00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:57.349\nLinux based, or\nany combination in between.\n\n22\n00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.356\nSo what I've done is put\ntogether a list of tools for you.\n\n23\n00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:03.795\nPut a little l in parenthesis at the end\nof the tools that would be Linux based.\n\n24\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:05.745\nThe ones that don't have\nthat would be Windows based.\n\n25\n00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.712\nGive you probably an easy\nway to refer to that.\n\n26\n00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:09.813\nIt's in the show notes,\nI obviously encourage to take a look.\n\n27\n00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:12.085\nYou can see it's a fairly long list there.\n\n28\n00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:14.989\nQuite a number of them are Linux based,\nbut you can see we have both.\n\n29\n00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:17.669\nBut we do have a series\nof tools that we can use.\n\n30\n00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:20.845\nNow, the Windows tool primarily\nany of the PS ones here.\n\n31\n00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:25.160\nAnd there are some PS itself is\ngonna be a Linux tool, right.\n\n32\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.920\nPra, top, list, things like that,\nprocess, etcetera.\n\n33\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.220\nBut the PS info, PS up time,\n\n34\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.890\nthose tools are gonna come to\nus as a port into Windows.\n\n35\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.710\nThose are gonna be found just\npart of the SysInternal Suite.\n\n36\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.510\nI've already mentioned these\nbefore at a certain point.\n\n37\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.710\nWe can download these from Microsoft,\nfrom TechNet as you can see.\n\n38\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.326\nYou download the whole suite,\nit's about 20 megs, 20 gigs.\n\n39\n00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of a difference there.\n\n40\n00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:52.774\n20 megs approximately, and there's a list\nof all the tools that are available,\n\n41\n00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:54.793\nrather extensive list right here.\n\n42\n00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:57.911\nIt's about 40 or so tools in the sweep.\n\n43\n00:01:57.911 --> 00:01:59.650\nAnd we can see there\na quite a number of them,\n\n44\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.777\nmany of them that you've\neither heard me talk about.\n\n45\n00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:03.834\nWe will talk about in upcoming episodes,\n\n46\n00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.075\nI made demo on occasions or\nat least refer to.\n\n47\n00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:09.681\nSome of my favorites, the auto-runs tool.\n\n48\n00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:14.073\nAllowing us to go in right here and see\nwhat is running in the system and profile.\n\n49\n00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:17.545\nWhat is available to us, what processes\nmay be there, things like that.\n\n50\n00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:20.068\nAlthough we can certainly\nsee schedule task, and\n\n51\n00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:22.777\na whole bunch of stuff\nare using different commands.\n\n52\n00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:27.978\nI like the pslist tool,\nthe procdump tool, the ps info tool,\n\n53\n00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:31.890\npskill, pslist, pspassword, psservice.\n\n54\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.235\nThis are all just gonna\nbe ports of Linux tools.\n\n55\n00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:39.441\nBut give us a way from the command line,\ntypically, to be able to interact with\n\n56\n00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:43.733\ninformation that may not be found in the\nGUI, but is still very valuable for us.\n\n57\n00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:46.065\nSo definitely,\na set of tools you wanna take a look at.\n\n58\n00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.435\nIt could be very valuable for\n\n59\n00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.945\nyou to deploy these tools,\na big warning recommendation, guidance.\n\n60\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.880\nI don't know, advice,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n61\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.552\nJust stuff you should pay attention to,\nright?\n\n62\n00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:57.064\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:02:57.064 --> 00:02:57.974\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it is,\n\n64\n00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:00.520\nyou wanna use these tools in\na different environment and\n\n65\n00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.400\ndifferent setting away from\nthe machine that you're gonna be\n\n66\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.830\nactually examining the first\ntime you're doing this.\n\n67\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.070\nTry these things out at home literally,\nsay hey, don't do this at home, right?\n\n68\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.490\nDo this at home, go and spin up a VM, spin\nup a machine that's not gonna be damaged\n\n69\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.335\nin any way, if you screw things up,\nand play around with these tools.\n\n70\n00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:20.310\nUnderstand what they do, understand\nthe limitations and dos and don'ts.\n\n71\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.470\nSo that when you start to use them\nprofessionally, and you get into these\n\n72\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.660\nenvironments where you have to deploy\nthese tools, you have confidence, right?\n\n73\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.655\nWith regards to what you're gonna do and\nhow you're gonna behave.\n\n74\n00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:30.879\nIt's very important for\nyou to play around with them and\n\n75\n00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.073\nhave a sense of what they are.\n\n76\n00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:34.050\nDefinitely download them, take a look.\n\n77\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.359\nLet's go in here and\n\n78\n00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.600\nlet's just take a look at one of these\nWindows tools that are built into Windows.\n\n79\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.231\nSpecifically a lot of times, we will take\nfor granted that there is a system, yes,\n\n80\n00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:48.157\nthat is how you spell that,\nvery important, okay.\n\n81\n00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:49.659\nYou have to stop and check.\n\n82\n00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.662\nSo we often take for\n\n83\n00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:55.060\ngranted that there is a lot of information\nin the system that we wanna get access to.\n\n84\n00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.500\nAnd we may go to five or\nsix different places to find them,\n\n85\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.280\ncuz we just don't realize that there's\na command that will give it to us.\n\n86\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.830\nThe DOS key command I went over with you\nin the history, Sub Command around that,\n\n87\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.310\nthe parameter I showed\nyou in the last step.\n\n88\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.210\nSo it's a good example of that.\n\n89\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.365\nWe have all that information in one place,\nright?\n\n90\n00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:10.880\nSo systeminfo is one of those\ntools that's very valuable.\n\n91\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.515\nNow, again,\nknowing how to use it is the trick here.\n\n92\n00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:18.306\nJust loading systeminfo like this will\ngive us a lot of information echoed\n\n93\n00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:19.472\nback to console.\n\n94\n00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:23.245\nBut doesn't really do us any good from a,\nhey let's capture it, let's gather it,\n\n95\n00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:26.117\nlet's forensically examine it,\noffload it from the system and\n\n96\n00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:27.629\nhave a record of it perspective.\n\n97\n00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.398\nIt's echoed back, and\nwhile we can scroll back up and say, okay,\n\n98\n00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:32.970\nyeah this is important,\nwant to know the name of the machine,\n\n99\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.698\nwant to know the hot fixes,\nwant to know this, want to know that.\n\n100\n00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:38.911\nTimezone there, UTC offset,\nall that stuff's important,\n\n101\n00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.930\nyou could see all the information\nabout this and how it's configured.\n\n102\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.705\nVery good to know, but\nI didn't capture any of this,\n\n103\n00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.749\nI just basically put it into the Shell.\n\n104\n00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.310\nWhat I need to do is look at system\ninfo and we've done this before.\n\n105\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.648\nYou've seen the help file but\nif you do you would see and FO switch,\n\n106\n00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.328\na format output switch, right?\n\n107\n00:04:56.328 --> 00:05:03.472\nAn FO would allow us, Maybe I'll put\nthis into a list, for instance, right?\n\n108\n00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:08.433\nAnd maybe put that out into a version that\nis essentially gonna look the same, right?\n\n109\n00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.465\nAs I did here, doesn't really look any\ndifferent, but instead of FO list,\n\n110\n00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:15.494\ninstead of maybe format output,\nmaybe I do it to a table.\n\n111\n00:05:15.494 --> 00:05:20.099\nMaybe I then out that right, or you\nessentially pass that through a pipe or\n\n112\n00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.819\nan out parameter to a file.\n\n113\n00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.709\nAgain, you offload from the system,\nand then capture that information and\n\n114\n00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.610\ntake it out, that would be helpful.\n\n115\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.391\nSo, looking at the system\ninfo tool is very important.\n\n116\n00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.993\nUnderstanding or the command rather, and\nunderstanding what we can do with it.\n\n117\n00:05:34.993 --> 00:05:37.878\nNoticing we can look at it for\na specific user.\n\n118\n00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:40.297\nWe could provide credentials\nin the domain, and\n\n119\n00:05:40.297 --> 00:05:43.897\nspecify how that should be outputted\nto a CSV file for instance, right?\n\n120\n00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:46.152\nSo we could do that, output it to a table.\n\n121\n00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:48.830\nSo all of these different ways we could\nwork with this information, right?\n\n122\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.095\nSo, would be valuable for you to be\nable to look at this information.\n\n123\n00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:58.380\nOutput it, and then ultimately, just to\nshow you what the table command does.\n\n124\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.817\nYou'll put it out in a slightly different\nform, probably not as easy to read,\n\n125\n00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:02.664\nright, as a list.\n\n126\n00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:04.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you wanna play with this,\n\n127\n00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.069\nto just again have a sense of the output,\nand what it does and does not look like.\n\n128\n00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.780\nBut system info is one of those good ones\nthat can actually be valuable for you.\n\n129\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.074\nYeah, there's other ones that are basic\nthat are available here, right.\n\n130\n00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:20.824\nWe have the ability to look at, for\ninstance, something like net statistics.\n\n131\n00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:25.852\nAnd take a look at the following services,\nserver and work station.\n\n132\n00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.368\nWhich ones are we going to\nbe able to work with again.\n\n133\n00:06:28.368 --> 00:06:32.525\nWe may need to drill down a little bit and\nlook at the help file, right, and\n\n134\n00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.670\nspecify work station or server.\n\n135\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.703\nAnd then dump the appropriate information,\nright, for that, right?\n\n136\n00:06:37.703 --> 00:06:44.377\nSo I could do either work station And\nthen when I do that,\n\n137\n00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:49.004\nI will see information about connections\nto the work station or the server service.\n\n138\n00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:51.417\nAnd that's what we're looking at,\nspecifically here.\n\n139\n00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:53.520\nHow many bytes have been sent and\nreceived?\n\n140\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.513\nWere there errors?\n\n141\n00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.430\nHow many connections, disconnections?\n\n142\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.846\nHow many sessions failed and accepted.\n\n143\n00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:02.194\nYou know these are things that would\nbe valuable that again are sitting\n\n144\n00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:06.294\nin registers, and cache, and memory, and\nvarious tool areas, and repositories.\n\n145\n00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:10.140\nThat we would wanna get access to,\nand understanding this information,\n\n146\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.250\nknowing that it is there and\nlooking at it would be helpful.\n\n147\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.825\nAnother tool on that list was\nthe net users tool, right?\n\n148\n00:07:16.825 --> 00:07:21.977\nAnd so looking at Net users,\n\n149\n00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:25.561\nand making sure that we can see who\nis connected to the machine, right,\n\n150\n00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:28.037\nwould be important,\nwe'd wanna know, right?\n\n151\n00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:31.776\nNow, I'm running as the administrator,\nand we see the default account, and\n\n152\n00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:33.030\nwe have the host account.\n\n153\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.471\nWhich has admin rights and\nwe have guests, right?\n\n154\n00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.495\nSo, you know, we can see different\nones that are there, right?\n\n155\n00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:40.468\nSo we'd wanna know that,\nagain what accounts are active.\n\n156\n00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:43.330\nCould I open the user manager,\nthe local user manager, and\n\n157\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.941\nyou'll find this information?\n\n158\n00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:47.614\nYeah, I could probably go delve around and\nsee if it's there, and\n\n159\n00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.867\nI could pull it up eventually.\n\n160\n00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:51.695\nBut the idea would be,\nthat it would probably be easier for\n\n161\n00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.538\nme to be able to pull it out of a file, or\n\n162\n00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:56.388\nat least out of a command line here,\nand then work with it.\n\n163\n00:07:56.388 --> 00:07:58.225\nSo there's a lot of these kinda tools.\n\n164\n00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:00.737\nI didn't download Any of\nthe system internal tools, but\n\n165\n00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:02.687\nwe could probably do\na quick download here.\n\n166\n00:08:02.687 --> 00:08:03.415\nSo why dont' we just do that.\n\n167\n00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:07.100\nLet me just demonstrate the auto-run's\ntool for you specifically.\n\n168\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.340\nSo let's just go grab this one\nin case you haven't seen this.\n\n169\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.330\nWe'll just download this one tool\ninstead of downloading the whole suite.\n\n170\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.750\nIt'll be pretty quick if we just do this.\n\n171\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:20.860\nJust dump this on the desktop here and\nthen let's just go ahead.\n\n172\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.240\nJust minimize all this for\njust one second.\n\n173\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.860\nAnd yeah, we're not worried about that for\nthe moment.\n\n174\n00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:34.245\nAnd get rid of that.\n\n175\n00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:40.900\nAnd that's just my remote desktop sessions\ninto my test machines being reset.\n\n176\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.400\nSo let us go in, let us grab auto runs 64.\n\n177\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.010\nLet us just grab that.\n\n178\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:52.650\nLet us just put that right out here and\n&gt;&gt; Really quickly\n\n179\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.510\nI am just on I am just you know we are\nthinking we are going through this stuff\n\n180\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.400\n&gt;&gt; I actually know what I want to do\n\n181\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.380\n&gt;&gt; A lot of these tools are text base,\n\n182\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.340\nI would been working in a lot of these\n&gt;&gt; Will doing like screen grabs\n\n183\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.690\nof graphical tools work just\nas well as a text output?\n\n184\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.750\n&gt;&gt; So they can and\ncertainly or an option force.\n\n185\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.480\nBut keep in mind that screen grabs create\n\n186\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.670\nnew files that\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n187\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.490\nas long as we output them to\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n188\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.120\nthat's the key thing is that you know,\nif we do them locally to the machine like\n\n189\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.620\nprint screen creates information in\nthe buffer that essentially modifies file,\n\n190\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.190\naccess modifies additional and\ncreates additional files, changes.\n\n191\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.090\nIn other words,\nthe dynamics of the data in the system.\n\n192\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.680\nEverything we do has this yin-yang\nkind of positive and negative effects.\n\n193\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.000\nWe're gonna be thinking about that.\n\n194\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.610\nCould we take those with cameras\nfrom outside the system and\n\n195\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.800\nabsolutely it's one of the ways\nwe do that traditionally.\n\n196\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.280\nWe may run a video camera literally,\njust recording everything we're doing\n\n197\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.180\nwatching and recording all\nthe keystrokes in everything we do and\n\n198\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.770\nthat can be date timestamps,\ndated in timestamps and\n\n199\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.390\nforensic we certify as being\nan accurate medium to again have to\n\n200\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:00.330\nsanitize the medium recording element\nthat we're using the SD card, whatever.\n\n201\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.660\nBut assuming we did that, we certainly\ncould use screen captures would probably\n\n202\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.490\njust do a videography record,\nwe would have and\n\n203\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.230\nit could end to that into evidence.\n\n204\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.410\nBecause maybe somebody is\nactually shooting that.\n\n205\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.570\nSo we could be seen doing stuff\nwill somebody is there certifying,\n\n206\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.280\nyes I was the camera\noperator this date and time.\n\n207\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, we could do that as well.\n\n208\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.060\nAlright, so with autoruns, right.\n\n209\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.150\nWhat we're, we're able to see and\n\n210\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.140\nit's an interesting tool if you\nhaven't play with it before.\n\n211\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.220\nBut again,\nanother way to capture information, right?\n\n212\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.920\nWe could see autorun entries,\nso what's in the registry keys?\n\n213\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.880\nYou maybe able to see as we look here.\n\n214\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.000\nWe're looking at the current version run,\ncurrent version\n\n215\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.310\nsoftware like what's in the run area so\nwe could see what's in there or\n\n216\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.140\nwhat kind of files are being\naccessed quite an extensive list.\n\n217\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.660\nOf things as well as the task scheduler\nwhere tasks are scheduled and\n\n218\n00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.870\nrunning when were they\nexecuted from what path.\n\n219\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.060\nThis is a very detailed thing.\n\n220\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.320\nAnd thing I like about\nthis is we can go in, and\n\n221\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.330\nwe can query any one of\nthese items that we find.\n\n222\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.590\nWe could search online to see if it is\nlegitimate process, legitimate file,\n\n223\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.280\nlegitimate entry, whatever.\n\n224\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.760\nWe can check to see if it is malware with\nvirus others could verify the digital\n\n225\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.420\ncenter of the image, see whether or\nnot it is going to be a hash,\n\n226\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.830\nproperly digitally signed filed yes or no\nand if so yes if not be told about that.\n\n227\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.430\nWe can also delete it or we can un\nselect it and prevent it from running.\n\n228\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.860\nAnd so we could do all of these stuff,\nright?\n\n229\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.580\nAnd we can go ahead and decide,\nwe could break this down,\n\n230\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.650\nwe could look at logon and\nlsas specific stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.310\nWe can look at the Windows Explorer,\nwe could look at internet explorer,\n\n232\n00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.410\nwe could look at schedule task if you saw\nthat so we could see what's running there.\n\n233\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.920\nAll the services that may be running\nagain we could go in to anyone,\n\n234\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.130\nservice and we could look at\ninformation about it right?\n\n235\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.620\nWe can go in and we can, see here.\n\n236\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.470\nWhat is that, Windows cannot find.\n\n237\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.250\nOkay, probably cuz of\nthe way I'm logged on.\n\n238\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.000\nNot gonna have the rights to that.\n\n239\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.120\nAll right, so we have drivers.\n\n240\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.560\nWe have boot execute image hijacks.\n\n241\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.010\nOffice, Specific Office.\n\n242\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.740\nWe're not running Office on this image but\n\n243\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:13.030\nif we were in a WMI related information\nare queries, network providers, things you\n\n244\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.010\ncould see as I go through these all sorts\nof stuff, we could see all that, right.\n\n245\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.680\nSo, we can do this.\n\n246\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.310\nNow, remember this is a virtual machine.\n\n247\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.170\nSo, certain things may or\nmay not show up and\n\n248\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.510\nbe found the same ways it\nwould in a physical machine.\n\n249\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.080\nBut in general,\nit's a powerful tool to show me\n\n250\n00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.520\ninformation about what may be running in\nthe system at any given moment in time.\n\n251\n00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.475\nThere's a lot of these kind of\ntools that I can leverage and\n\n252\n00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:35.851\nreally go in under the hood and\nstart to examine and play with that,\n\n253\n00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:38.144\nthat would be valuable potentially for\nme and\n\n254\n00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:42.220\ncould offer me a lot of insight into\nthe kind of stuff that may be going on.\n\n255\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.270\nWe keep hearing me refer to this tool\ncalled DD that we can use to make images\n\n256\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.620\nfor forensic investigation.\n\n257\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.370\nIt's a Linux-based Imaging tool\nI actually pointed out to you.\n\n258\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.900\nWhen we went into Kali right we're\ntalking about autopsy I pointed out and\n\n259\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.470\nsaid look there's one of\nthe DD tools right there.\n\n260\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.490\nSo the syntax for\n\n261\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.420\ndd is pretty straightforward\nrelatively speaking of course.\n\n262\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.590\nBut pretty straightforward.\n\n263\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.460\nYou'll see listdlls is also another good\ntool on the Windows side that's good just\n\n264\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.080\nto check the DLLs that are there.\n\n265\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.580\nThat lets you see all the DLLs.\n\n266\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.700\nWhich reminds me also if you're\nnot familiar with SIGVERIF\n\n267\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.420\nwhich is also a tool that we should\nrun and as a forensic investigator,\n\n268\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.420\nlet me show you this\nbefore we get into DD.\n\n269\n00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.920\nRemember, kind of in real time.\n\n270\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.690\nOff the top of my head, list DLLs,\nnamely remember SIGVERIF.\n\n271\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.310\nBut if you haven't seen SIGVERIF,\nshort for signature verification.\n\n272\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.060\nAnd just in a Windows tool, just move this\nhere, just literally type SIGVERIF and\n\n273\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.060\nyou'll get the file\nsignature verification tool.\n\n274\n00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.420\nIt's been there, God,\nback to at least 2000, I think.\n\n275\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.410\nAnd probably, at least that long.\n\n276\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.890\nMaybe even NT 4.\n\n277\n00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.440\nBut you'll go through and what this does\nis it checks the core DLL's of the Windows\n\n278\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.800\noperating system, validates the digital\nsignatures, the hashes on these files, and\n\n279\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.890\nif anything is not found to match,\nbased on the manifest list that\n\n280\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.165\nMicrosoft provides and\nis part of the Windows update process.\n\n281\n00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:54.855\n[INAUDIBLE] and all that, we don't see\nmatches we flag these files as being\n\n282\n00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:59.095\nessentially modified, they've probably\nbeen messed around with in some way and\n\n283\n00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:02.485\nthen we are given a list of them we can\nalso auto repair and self repair and\n\n284\n00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:05.980\nthings like that, so we run this,\nyou will see it just goes real quick and\n\n285\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.280\nit is scanning device drivers.\n\n286\n00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.830\nIt is just looking at the device\ndriver files, right and wait for\n\n287\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.530\nit to finish it comes back and says,\nyes everything is good or hey,\n\n288\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.570\nit is not and we are able to look at and\nget a quick read.\n\n289\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.270\nAgain this is Windows specific this is not\nLinux they have a different process for\n\n290\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.220\nLinux, we don't have a tool like this.\n\n291\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.340\nYou files have been scanned and\n\n292\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.460\nare verified as digitally signed, meaning\nwe would be able to certify that as of now\n\n293\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.870\nof I captured this screen That we ran\nthis tool at this day and time right?\n\n294\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.010\nWe'd obviously capture it with probably\nthe calendar available at the time so\n\n295\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.010\nwe could see it.\n\n296\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.570\nAnd as a result we could say hey at\nthe time we investigated the machine, all\n\n297\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.180\nthe files that Microsoft said should be\nthere we said appear to be intact right?\n\n298\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.940\nSo we're not modifying the system\nentries on these files in any way.\n\n299\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.560\nWe're just simply doing a comparison\nto ensure they're valid.\n\n300\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.840\nSo we could run a tool like this\nas part of the investigation.\n\n301\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.080\nAgain, it would be a valuable additional\ntool that could help us to verify and\n\n302\n00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.150\nvalidate certain kinds of information so\nanyway.\n\n303\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.940\nSo DD, the source, or rather the syntax\nfor DD is probably good for you to know.\n\n304\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.530\nPut some of it into the nodes.\n\n305\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.910\nI went through and also gave you some\nadditional syntax for things like, hey,\n\n306\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.730\nhow do I clone an entire\nhard disk using DD?\n\n307\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.600\nHow do I clone in FreeBSD and Linux?\n\n308\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.470\nSo Linux and Unix, FreeBSD Being UNIX.\n\n309\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.260\nUnderstanding what we just did.\n\n310\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.510\nKind of breaking it down to give\nyou a little understanding of it.\n\n311\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.780\nHow do I clone a partition as\nopposed to an entire drive.\n\n312\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.110\nHow do I use DD to make a disk to\ndisk image instead of just cloning?\n\n313\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.770\nYeah, walked us through the syntax, the\nlogic, the language and the explanation\n\n314\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.190\nof all the different ways to use DD\nbecause it will important for you.\n\n315\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.990\nIt's one of those tools that, we\nare very likely to ask about on an exam,\n\n316\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.240\nor at least you should be aware\nof with regard to the exam.\n\n317\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.950\nI talked about how you can use additional\ncommands to make an image of a CD,\n\n318\n00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.035\nmake an image of you have a floppy,\nnot that you do that very often.\n\n319\n00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.265\nBut you get the idea.\n\n320\n00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:56.959\nRestoring disk partition, and or\ncopying the RAM, memory to a file.\n\n321\n00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.005\nYou'll see you can dump the memory.\n\n322\n00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:00.810\nDD is a very powerful tool.\n\n323\n00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.956\nIt can be used to acquire\nAll sorts of data.\n\n324\n00:16:03.956 --> 00:16:08.170\nDCFLDD which is an other\nversion that also is used.\n\n325\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.640\nThis was actually in the Kali Linux\nas well, we saw this earlier and\n\n326\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.520\npointed it out, but it was sitting as\npart of the tool set there, forensically.\n\n327\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.010\nWe can use this to acquire data also.\n\n328\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.190\nAnd we can go in, and\nuse this to be able to go in, and\n\n329\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.960\nto split the image file onto smaller\nchunks, and hash the images.\n\n330\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.390\nThat's what DCFLDD is for.\n\n331\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.820\nTraditionally, let us chunk the images.\n\n332\n00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.505\nInstead of one massive file, you may not\nknow now, depending on how old you are and\n\n333\n00:16:32.505 --> 00:16:33.637\nwhen you've done this.\n\n334\n00:16:33.637 --> 00:16:38.071\nBut traditionally, years ago when we would\ndo this, we often would capture images at\n\n335\n00:16:38.071 --> 00:16:42.505\nabout 600, 650 megs in size which, Dan\nis probably shaking his head thinking I\n\n336\n00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:45.430\nknow why, because that was\na size of a CD-ROM, right?\n\n337\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.315\nAnd as a result, we have to chunk them so\n\n338\n00:16:47.315 --> 00:16:50.285\nthat way you could fit them on to\nmedia to be able to run them, or\n\n339\n00:16:50.285 --> 00:16:53.799\nto be able to use them or stitch them\ntogether, so you'd like one of ten.\n\n340\n00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:56.090\nAnd you have to then\nexplode out the image set.\n\n341\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.319\nAnd then add the image two,\nimage three, image four, and\n\n342\n00:16:58.319 --> 00:16:59.423\nput them all back together.\n\n343\n00:16:59.423 --> 00:17:02.990\nIt's not such a big deal today,\nbecause today we install to a hard drive.\n\n344\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.270\nWe have terabyte plus hard drives,\n\n345\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.360\nwe're not worried about\nstorage capacity as much.\n\n346\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.810\nI mean, granted if you are imaging\na 20 terabyte array, yeah,\n\n347\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.820\nyou need to chunk the images but\nthen again,\n\n348\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.080\nyou're probably using other technology,\nyou're not doing something like this.\n\n349\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.330\nBut my point is that,\nwe do have this capability so\n\n350\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.540\nwe can use DCFLDD to do this,\nbut also to put hashes\n\n351\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.350\nat the end of those image chunks that\nwe can verify the integrity of them.\n\n352\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.420\nSo as we go to use them and\n\n353\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.220\nstitch them back together again,\nwe know they are forensically sound.\n\n354\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.690\nSo we have different approaches,\ndifferent tools,\n\n355\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.290\ndifferent processes depending\non what we're doing and why.\n\n356\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.742\nSo, you just know that all\nthat information is here.\n\n357\n00:17:38.742 --> 00:17:42.116\nBut let's just go back\nup here really quickly.\n\n358\n00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:46.605\nSo for instance, right, if we want to\ngo in and we'll just take a look here,\n\n359\n00:17:46.605 --> 00:17:51.020\ncloning an entire hard drive for\ninstance, just hypothetically.\n\n360\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.437\nAnd let me just see if I can fit this\nall on the screen kind of at once.\n\n361\n00:17:54.437 --> 00:17:58.540\nSo the basic syntax is right there,\nall right?\n\n362\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.910\nSo basic syntax is actually here.\n\n363\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.332\nAnd that would just kinda break it down,\nusing either Linux or\n\n364\n00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.020\nFreeBSD, and I'll kinda walk\nyou through the logic of this.\n\n365\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.310\nBut you'll see here,\ndd if= whatever the path is.\n\n366\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.520\nWhere it says, DEVICE HERE,\n\n367\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.640\nright, we're obviously specifying the path\nof the device, right, just so you can see.\n\n368\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.010\nSo if right,\n\n369\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:21.220\nis the input device file, of is the output\ndevice or file, just so you can see.\n\n370\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.470\nSo let's just take a look at one of these\nlines right here, let me just scroll up so\n\n371\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.450\nwe could see that.\n\n372\n00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:31.000\nSo let's say we were doing this\nhere in FreeBSD, size of 250 gigs.\n\n373\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.500\nSo to clone, dev/ada0 250 gigs to dev/adb0\n250 gigs regardless of whatever, right.\n\n374\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.930\nWe would do at the command prompt,\nright, so with the prompt,\n\n375\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.150\nthat's what the hashtag represents.\n\n376\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.888\nNow, we're Twittering the site, right?\n\n377\n00:18:43.888 --> 00:18:45.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So #dd.\n\n378\n00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:46.569\n&gt;&gt; #dd.\n\n379\n00:18:46.569 --> 00:18:48.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so no hash tag whatever,\n\n380\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.395\nthat's just coming out prompt, right?\n\n381\n00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:54.455\nSo dd would be called, right, if it's\nremembered the input device in file.\n\n382\n00:18:54.455 --> 00:18:58.110\nSo if dev/ada0 input device\nin file where it's mounted.\n\n383\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.630\nOutput device file dev/adb0,\nso we can figure that out.\n\n384\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.790\nFirst device, by the way.\n\n385\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.410\nZero means first device, right.\n\n386\n00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.640\nSo we know, start at zero,\nnot at one, all right?\n\n387\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.915\nSo then, we have bs, right,\nwhat's the block size?\n\n388\n00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:14.350\n64k, such the block size 64k.\n\n389\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.000\nYou can use 128k, or\nwhatever value, 256, etc.\n\n390\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.900\nSo 64k, and then conv=noerror, right?\n\n391\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.330\nSo it tells dd to continue,\n\n392\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.290\nignoring all read errors, so\ncontinue regardless of error, right?\n\n393\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.750\nAnd then sync, add input blocks with\nzeros if there are any read errors, so\n\n394\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.080\ndata offset stays in sync.\n\n395\n00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.480\nMeaning, we talked about this.\n\n396\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.726\nThis is important when we do this.\n\n397\n00:19:34.726 --> 00:19:38.091\nIf you remember the data offsets I\nshowed you with the WinHex editor,\n\n398\n00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:42.425\nwhere we look at the offsets, 1 through\n15, 16 through 30, that kind of thing.\n\n399\n00:19:42.425 --> 00:19:45.910\nAnd looking for that,\nwe plug zeros in where we get errors,\n\n400\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.615\nthat way we keep the offsets lined up so\nthat we know that we have that amount, but\n\n401\n00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:52.785\nwe can say, look, the zeros are fillers.\n\n402\n00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.125\nAnd we understand there's\na logical point that,\n\n403\n00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:57.355\nthat's where we see the errors\nwhen we're doing the reads.\n\n404\n00:19:57.355 --> 00:20:00.410\nSo we may add that to just keep\neverything lined up properly, and\n\n405\n00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.740\nthen see that data\nshowing up the right way.\n\n406\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.970\nBut if we issue this command and\n\n407\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.970\nhit enter, we'll just essentially\nnow be copying back and forth.\n\n408\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:12.330\nWe can get 250 gigs of data or whatever\nit is, and we're done at 64K chunks.\n\n409\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.680\nHopefully, not too many errors or\nany, then we'll be done.\n\n410\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.630\nHow long does it take?\n\n411\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.870\nHard to say, whatever that is\nbased on a lot of variables,\n\n412\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.600\nthe IO speed on both sides for IOPS.\n\n413\n00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.260\nThe speed, the read write on the devices,\nthat kind of thing, but eventually,\n\n414\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.210\nit'll finish, right?\n\n415\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.500\nAnd we've got nowhere to go and\nnothing to do.\n\n416\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nwe're just gonna wait for that to happen.\n\n417\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.720\nBut that's what we would do with dd.\n\n418\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.150\nSo it would be important for\nyou, as a forensic investigator,\n\n419\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.550\nto understand the logic of how dd works.\n\n420\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.630\nIt is really important for you to\nunderstand how to use a tool like this.\n\n421\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.870\nYou, remember, may not use this tool,\nbut remember dd can create raw images.\n\n422\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.500\nThe image that is essentially image tech,\nthat can be used by any tool anywhere, and\n\n423\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.790\nit is often the tool of choice,\nbecause it is so versatile, but\n\n424\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.840\nit is a command line tool.\n\n425\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.598\nSo you've got to get a little comfortable\nwith the syntax and the scripting.\n\n426\n00:20:55.598 --> 00:20:59.110\nSo just to understand that, and make sure\nyou are comfortable with that, right?\n\n427\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.180\nSame thing down here.\n\n428\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.220\nIf we're cloning, right,\nfrom device sdc1 to device sddd1, right?\n\n429\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.400\ndd if, so the input path,\ndevice sdc1 output path, the block size,\n\n430\n00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.550\n128 k, right,\ncontinue on read errors and sync.\n\n431\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.350\nInsert the zeroes on read error\nto keep the tracking in line,\n\n432\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.539\nright, with all of the offsets.\n\n433\n00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:24.180\nSo you again, once we see the syntax,\nwe have a sense of what we're doing,\n\n434\n00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.890\nwe should be able to read\nany one of these lines, and\n\n435\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.790\nunderstand logically what it does.\n\n436\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.710\nWhat might you see on an exam?\n\n437\n00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.890\nI would not be surprised if you saw syntax\nalong the lines of something like this.\n\n438\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.260\nNot this, but in theory,\nsomething like this.\n\n439\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.504\nAnd you were presented to\nunderstand the options were okay,\n\n440\n00:21:39.504 --> 00:21:42.280\nso essentially, what are we copying from,\nwhat are we copying to,\n\n441\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.880\nhow big is the block size,\nare we gonna continue on there.\n\n442\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.010\nThere's all these questions we could ask,\nright?\n\n443\n00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.274\nYou'd have to answer whatever question\nwas asked based on reading, and\n\n444\n00:21:50.274 --> 00:21:51.568\nunderstanding the syntax.\n\n445\n00:21:51.568 --> 00:21:52.920\nSo it would be valuable for you.\n\n446\n00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.341\nThere are a few tools we tell you\ndefinitely need to zero and we wanna know.\n\n447\n00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:58.060\nYour dd is one of those tools, right?\n\n448\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.567\nAnd CEH, Nmap is one of those tools, gotta\nknow Nmap, right, Daniel's done a whole\n\n449\n00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:04.310\nshow actually, a couple of shows on Nmap\n&gt;&gt; A whole series, yeah.\n\n450\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.630\n&gt;&gt; A whole series on Nmap.\n\n451\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.330\nSo one of those tools that you really\nwanna understand to learn, and\n\n452\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.170\nreally know about, not just because\nit's important from an exam perspective,\n\n453\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.890\nbut in the real world doing\nthe hacking and offensive hacking, and\n\n454\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.510\ndefensive hacking kind of work.\n\n455\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.610\nAs a security professional,\nNmap is one of the standard tools.\n\n456\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.330\nIt's essentially your Phillips-head or\nstandard screwdriver.\n\n457\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.270\nYou really can't operate without it,\nright, you need it.\n\n458\n00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.470\nWhether it's Zenmap, the Windows porter,\nNmap traditional, whatever it is,\n\n459\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.380\nyou need that just like you need a WinPcap\nor LibPcap promiscuous mode driver.\n\n460\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.460\nProbably need both, you know why?\n\n461\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.654\nBecause if one is good, two is better.\n\n462\n00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:35.228\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:36.775\n&gt;&gt; And three is better than two, right?\n\n464\n00:22:36.775 --> 00:22:37.998\n&gt;&gt; Ex-Lax.\n\n465\n00:22:37.998 --> 00:22:39.966\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You need all that stuff.\n\n466\n00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:42.296\nSo it would be important for\nyou to know about this things, right?\n\n467\n00:22:42.296 --> 00:22:44.070\nIt would be very important for\nyou to have a sense of that.\n\n468\n00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.860\nSo, make sure you're familiar with that.\n\n469\n00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.890\nMake sure you go back,\ntake a look at some of the notes on dd.\n\n470\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.590\nMake sure you understand the logic and\nthe syntax of how that's going to work.\n\n471\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.962\nAnd make sure you would be comfortable\nanswering questions about that, if asked.\n\n472\n00:22:55.962 --> 00:22:59.538\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, now that we've taken\nour image, the next question is how do we\n\n473\n00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:02.284\nactually validate that it's good,\nthe integrity is there?\n\n474\n00:23:02.284 --> 00:23:03.853\nAbsolutely, you see that's great question.\n\n475\n00:23:03.853 --> 00:23:05.095\nWe've actually talked about this already,\n\n476\n00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:07.105\nwe've done a demo on this in\none of the earlier episodes.\n\n477\n00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:10.167\nWe've talked about hashing,\nshould you HashCalc, how to use that?\n\n478\n00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:13.685\nValidating data acquisition\nis done through hashes.\n\n479\n00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:14.328\nWe've talked about this.\n\n480\n00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:16.220\nIf we take a look on the screen,\nwe can go full size,\n\n481\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.720\nif you take a look here quickly.\n\n482\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.590\nCommon hashes, again just for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n483\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.788\nWe've talked about CRC-32.\n\n484\n00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:24.430\nYou've heard me mention the MD series,\nMD5.\n\n485\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.150\nI've shown you MD5 and SHI-1.\n\n486\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.401\nSHI-1 is short of SHI-160.\n\n487\n00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:30.050\nThat's how you often hear it referred to.\n\n488\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.980\nThere are SHI- 256, SHI-512, etc.\n\n489\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.076\nThe idea is that, we use a hash,\n\n490\n00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:38.820\na mechanism that essentially\nis going to work like this.\n\n491\n00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.260\nSo let me just quickly throw\na formula out here for you.\n\n492\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.889\nSo HASHING, right, is = to the following.\n\n493\n00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:50.908\nvariable size data as input\n\n494\n00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:56.364\n+ hash algorithm = fixed bit\n\n495\n00:23:56.364 --> 00:24:02.257\nstream Output which is commonly\n\n496\n00:24:02.257 --> 00:24:07.944\nreferred to as the hash value.\n\n497\n00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:13.318\nAnd I just did that all [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That is awesome, okay?\n\n498\n00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:14.424\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I did\n\n499\n00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:17.697\nthat while I was multitasking,\nspeaking and typing, I made no mistakes.\n\n500\n00:24:17.697 --> 00:24:18.243\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n501\n00:24:18.243 --> 00:24:20.660\n&gt;&gt; That is worth like awesome,\nawesome accolades.\n\n502\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.980\n&gt;&gt; And it is recorded for posterity.\n\n503\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.600\n&gt;&gt; And now I can say I actually,\nyes we did, right.\n\n504\n00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.090\nYou did get that, right, that is?\n\n505\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.970\n&gt;&gt; It's on film.\n\n506\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.470\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n507\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.940\nSo just to put it out there just so\n\n508\n00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.570\nyou know, right this is generically how\nwe would represent the hashing formula.\n\n509\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.250\nThe idea that we would\nuse variable sized data.\n\n510\n00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.520\nRemember, it could be a single file.\n\n511\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.220\nIt could be the entire hard drive.\n\n512\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.570\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n513\n00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.814\nWhatever hash algorithm we use, MD5,\n\n514\n00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:46.320\nSHY-1, and then we get the fix bit stream\noutput commonly called the hash value.\n\n515\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.408\nIf you didn't see that episode I\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n516\n00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:53.090\nI walked you through the logic in the hard\ndrive and file systems episode as we did\n\n517\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.430\nthe hands on piece about how to use\na hash calculator to fix the hashes and\n\n518\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.740\nshow the output clarification\nin the integrity check.\n\n519\n00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.810\nYou've seen in a lot of the data\nacquisition tools we've been using\n\n520\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.240\nthat we can generate hashes and\nor that we can compare them.\n\n521\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.110\nSo it would be helpful for\nyou to know that.\n\n522\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.490\nAnd obviously if we're thinking about\nexam, exam preparation, perhaps focusing\n\n523\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.388\non these four in particular, knowing\nthe output value, the number of bits.\n\n524\n00:25:17.388 --> 00:25:21.795\nCRC-32, 32 bit output, MD5, 128 bit.\n\n525\n00:25:21.795 --> 00:25:25.103\nSHY-1 short for 160 bits.\n\n526\n00:25:25.103 --> 00:25:28.587\nSHY-2 256 bit output.\n\n527\n00:25:28.587 --> 00:25:30.850\nMaking sure we are aware of that.\n\n528\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:35.180\nThat would help you and allow you to\nanswer questions if asked on the exam.\n\n529\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.220\nBut the short answer to the long question,\nhow do we validate data acquisition?\n\n530\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.030\nWe use hashes to do so.\n\n531\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.770\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam,\nthis has been an interesting conversation.\n\n532\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:49.230\nDefinitely one that seems very pertinent\nto us as CHFIs or potential CHFIs.\n\n533\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.890\nSo definitely take some time,\n\n534\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.960\nlike I always like to tell you\nat the end of these episodes.\n\n535\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.460\nWork your way through this stuff,\nif you're unfamiliar with this information\n\n536\n00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.810\nmake sure that you understand\neach one of the concepts and\n\n537\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.880\nmaybe even practices that we've walked\nthrough In all of our shows here.\n\n538\n00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.744\nSo this is no exception to that rule.\n\n539\n00:26:05.744 --> 00:26:10.266\nYou'll wanna understand how do we collect\ndata, how is that done with integrity and\n\n540\n00:26:10.266 --> 00:26:14.100\nforensically sound means, and\nthen ultimately how do we verify that.\n\n541\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.090\nSo very good stuff, we do thank\nyou Adam for joining us today and\n\n542\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.380\nshowing us how to do that.\n\n543\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.560\nWe thank our audience for watching\nas well, but as I look at our clock.\n\n544\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.470\nWell, the time has dwindled to nothing for\nus.\n\n545\n00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.650\nSo thank you for watching.\n\n546\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.420\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n547\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.820\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n548\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.100\nThat guy who knows how to type.\n\n549\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.710\n&gt;&gt; He did do it.\n\n550\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.450\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time everyone.\n\n551\n00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.409\n&gt;&gt; Take care.\n\n552\n00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:39.823\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:26:39.823 --> 00:26:42.614\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.350\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.460\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.130\nAnd in this episode, we are back with\nmore on our CHFI Version 9 series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.400\nAnd continuing to join us in\nthe studio to lend us his\n\n11\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820\nexpert knowledge on that topic,\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon is back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.750\nWelcome back, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.510\nHow is it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.940\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well.\n\n15\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.490\nHopefully going good for\neverybody that is participating with us.\n\n16\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.140\nAnd hopefully there are lots and\nlots of view.\n\n17\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.290\nWe are going to do a little hands on demo.\n\n18\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.910\nWe're gonna jump in what we've been\ntalking about in our prior episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.770\ndata acquisition, and the way we deal\nwith data acquisition and duplication.\n\n20\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.020\nThought it would be good to put some of\nthat knowledge to the test as they say.\n\n21\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.654\nSo, we're gonna jump in and show you how\nto use a couple of different disk tools to\n\n22\n00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:59.460\nexplore, look at, partitions, things\nlike that that we've been talking about.\n\n23\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.236\nAnd be able to go out and as a result\ngrab an image, or extract an image,\n\n24\n00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:07.397\nshow you how to chunk that image up,\nperhaps talk about splitting it up in some\n\n25\n00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:10.040\ncases when we extract a way\nof options to do that.\n\n26\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.320\nSo, we'll take a look at that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.200\nSo, if you want to join me over here,\nwe're in our- one of our demo machines.\n\n28\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.950\nNow, we'll just move this over a bit,\nso we can see that.\n\n29\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.600\nAnd [COUGH] what we're gonna do is,\nlet me just roll up here for a second, so\n\n30\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.420\nwe can see the top of the screen.\n\n31\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.910\nI got a image that we often been using for\na lot of demos here our partition image.\n\n32\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.220\nAnd so, what we're gonna do is open up a\ncouple of different tools mount that image\n\n33\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.170\none called disk explorer for NTFS just\nkind of drag that front and center.\n\n34\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.030\nSo, we can see that first, we'll also\nuse access data FTK, forensics tool kit,\n\n35\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.960\nImager, so\n\n36\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.490\ntwo pieces of forensic software that we\ncan use, we'll put that one over there for\n\n37\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.830\nthe moment, it's a shortcut just so,\nwe can what we're gonna be working with.\n\n38\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.590\nNow, I've already actually created,\nextracted an image using the disk\n\n39\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.720\nexplorer, and I'm gonna show you how we do\nthat, but the image is a two part image,\n\n40\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.340\nI have the test image file right there\nwe can see, it's about 650, 656 megs.\n\n41\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.740\nWe chunked it, so as a result we have\npart two sitting up here, right up here.\n\n42\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.560\nAnd this one is about 367,\nlet's say, almost 400 megs.\n\n43\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.386\nAnd so, these two together\nactually make up the image, but\n\n44\n00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:28.526\nwe were splitting the image, or split it\nwhen we extract it we have that option.\n\n45\n00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:32.825\nWe talked about that, I think, in one of\nour other episodes Daniel and I mentioned\n\n46\n00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:36.934\nthe fact that, you know, back years ago\nwhen you used to have to store images on\n\n47\n00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:41.640\nremoval media like a CD where the storage\ncapacity was approximately 700 megabytes.\n\n48\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.565\nYou would actually have to\nsplit the image files up and\n\n49\n00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:48.990\nthen reproduce them, or stitch them back\ntogether again from multiple inputs.\n\n50\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.830\nAnd so, you would have to use software\nthat would effectively do this and\n\n51\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.090\nchunk the image into multiple parts,\nsizing those parts accordingly, and\n\n52\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.590\nallowing you to have some\nsort of a manifest file, or\n\n53\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.290\na list file that could be used to say,\nthis is part five of six and, yeah,\n\n54\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.310\nwe need this file, with this name and\nthis sequence, in doing that.\n\n55\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.220\nSo, I've just gone, I haven't done that\njust to begin, so you can see as we work\n\n56\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.130\nbackwards and show you how we do this,\nwhat the output would look like.\n\n57\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.910\nSo, we've got these two images sitting\nhere, and what we're going to do is load\n\n58\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.220\nthe disk explorer up,\nRuntime Software manufacture this.\n\n59\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.230\nJust go up here.\n\n60\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.134\nWe'll make this full size just so, you\ncould see this a little bit easier, and\n\n61\n00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:26.685\nthen we have a big white nothing, right?\n\n62\n00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.800\n[LAUGH] So, we'll go in and\nwe'll go to File here.\n\n63\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.630\nWe're gonna go and open up our image.\n\n64\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.860\nSo, we're starting with an image file.\n\n65\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.460\nRemember, we may be loading\nan image if we already have one,\n\n66\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.270\nwe may be loading a drive if we have one.\n\n67\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.460\nSo, remember, we may be running this\non a machine that we will want to grab\n\n68\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.470\nan image of.\n\n69\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.810\nWe already have a image\nwe want to investigate.\n\n70\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.649\nThere are different ways we can do this,\nyou may load up\n\n71\n00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.566\nthat image you have created, or this\ntool may be used to create that image.\n\n72\n00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.170\nIt is going to be up to you\nto decide how to do it.\n\n73\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.390\nSo, I am going to start that image file\nthat DD file that I have, remember,\n\n74\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.300\nwe went through the process of how\nyou would create an image using DD in\n\n75\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.300\none of our prior episodes.\n\n76\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.030\nIf you haven't seen that, be a good\nidea for you to at least take a look.\n\n77\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.940\nWe walked you through the logic of DD\nas a tool, talked about the syntax.\n\n78\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.220\nGave you about seven different examples\nand different ways you could use DD,\n\n79\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.110\nto create an image of a CD-ROM, create an\nimage of a floppy, not that you would be\n\n80\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.290\ndoing all that often, anymore, but\nto create images of various things.\n\n81\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.690\nTalked about how to do that, I think,\nin what, both Linux and FreeBSD, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.660\nWe talked about the different ways of\ndoing that with a 250 gig partition as our\n\n83\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.800\nsource, outputting it and\nspecifying the bit size.\n\n84\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.370\nSo, good information for\n\n85\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.940\nyou to take a look at, especially if\nyou haven't used the tool before.\n\n86\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.370\nIt will be good for you to have\na sense of that, as we talked about,\n\n87\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.350\na little hands on.\n\n88\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.410\nRemember, the tool is a Linux-based tool,\nso we CDD in Cali for instance\n\n89\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.250\nshowed in one of our prior episodes where\nyou would find it as we went into Kali and\n\n90\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.440\ntook a look at Autopsy.\n\n91\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.296\nPointed out that DD was there as\npart of the forensics toolkit.\n\n92\n00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.236\nAnd you would just go and\nfire that up, and\n\n93\n00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:55.119\nthen from your terminal be able to execute\nthose commands that we had talked about,\n\n94\n00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.948\nor in your Unix derivative, or\nwhatever you may be running,\n\n95\n00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:00.790\nyou would essentially then have\naccess to the tool, right?\n\n96\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.880\nSo, that kind of thing.\n\n97\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.460\nYou ever use that when you're in\nyour Unix, Linux, hybrid world,\n\n98\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.160\nyou ever use any of these?\n\n99\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n100\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Not very hard to use, right?\n\n101\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.910\n&gt;&gt; No, it's very simple,\ninput file, output file, or\n\n102\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.930\noutput-\n&gt;&gt; Remember, IF, input, OF, output.\n\n103\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.890\nWe've talked about that as\npart of syntax as well.\n\n104\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.530\nThis will tell it where to get it from,\n\n105\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.780\nwhere to put it, and then a couple of\nminor parameters about block size.\n\n106\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.820\nAnd it's very easy to use.\n\n107\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.550\nProbably one of the simpler\nof the Linux tools.\n\n108\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.780\nWe've talked about this fear factor.\n\n109\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.470\nThis misperception about Linux and\n\n110\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.420\nthe fact that, because traditionally\nit was seen by many Windows admins.\n\n111\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.320\nCertainly not by people that work with\nit everyday, but by Windows admins\n\n112\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.630\nthat are more of a GUI-centric kind\nof thought processes we administer.\n\n113\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.310\nThat has been seen traditionally as\nbeing that tool, or that tool set, or\n\n114\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.360\nthat operating system,\nmay be a little harder to interact with.\n\n115\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.790\nBut, you know, Daniel talks about\nit a lot, I talk about it a lot.\n\n116\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.120\nWe both use various\nderivatives on a regular basis.\n\n117\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.790\nAlthough he probably spends more\ntime in some of them as I do,\n\n118\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.170\nbecause I don't use Freebie as D and\nthings like that all that often.\n\n119\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.260\nBut it's not that difficult to work with,\nand it's one of the more common tools\n\n120\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.540\nquite honestly on that platform\nespecially for what we're talking about.\n\n121\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.180\nWith forensics, with security,\nthings of that nature.\n\n122\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.160\nYou're constantly having to create\nimages and do a variety of things.\n\n123\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.936\nPlus and they make great\nChristmas gifts and [CROSSTALK].\n\n124\n00:06:15.936 --> 00:06:18.340\nPack it something up,\ngive it to somebody, very easy to do.\n\n125\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.230\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna load up an image here.\n\n126\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.560\nI'll just go grab this.\n\n127\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.482\nWe have on our desktop, either the test\nimage the one that I've just created.\n\n128\n00:06:27.482 --> 00:06:31.230\nAnd door, we can go in,\nwhich is not the one we wanna use.\n\n129\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.610\nI'm gonna go and\nuse the partition, the raw image.\n\n130\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.780\nSo, I'm just gonna go load that one up,\n\n131\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.270\ncuz remember, we actually already\ncreated that test image file.\n\n132\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.110\nSo, when I showed you that\nI outputted from this tool.\n\n133\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.190\nSo, we're gonna walk backwards through\nthe logic of how we did that, and\n\n134\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.800\nthen ultimately I will show\nyou how to produce that image.\n\n135\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.180\nAnd we'll be able to see\nwhat that looks like.\n\n136\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.640\nSo, when we load the disk image\nup out of DD, what we'll find is,\n\n137\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.350\nlet's see if I can move this over just\na touch, so you, guys, can see that,\n\n138\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.080\nwe find that it's kind of hard to see,\nit's in blue in the background there.\n\n139\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.380\nYou probably can kinda see the watermark.\n\n140\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.630\nWe have the boot sector,\nthe valid boot sector right up here I'm\n\n141\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.150\npointing to it right and\nthen we have invalid boot sectors.\n\n142\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.230\nPartitions on the drive that are not\ngoing to be used for booting, but\n\n143\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.380\nobviously contain data.\n\n144\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.260\nThey're marked with that\nwatermark of invalid.\n\n145\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.330\nIt's that blue aqua kind it's almost so\nlight, it's hard to see, but it is there.\n\n146\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.830\nIt's kinda right there as I\nhover over it marked as invalid.\n\n147\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.500\nThat just tells us not that\nthe partition doesn't work.\n\n148\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.067\nBut rather it's not a bootable partition,\nthat's what the tool is designed to\n\n149\n00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:36.703\ndifferentiate between, so the valid boot\nsector starting right here, and then\n\n150\n00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:41.429\nthe other invalid boot sector marked here\nwhere we can then look for and find data.\n\n151\n00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:45.831\nSo, the first thing we see is the ability\nto differentiate here, the next thing that\n\n152\n00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:50.357\nwe're able to do traditionally is, we will\noften want to go walk through the sectors,\n\n153\n00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:54.697\nand we talked about this, remember, back\nin our discussions about hard drives and\n\n154\n00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:59.010\nfile systems, we talked about how\nsectors are setup, where they come from.\n\n155\n00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.432\nWhy it's important to\nhave knowledge of them.\n\n156\n00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:04.720\nWe talked about offsets, we talked about\nbits, bytes, all that kind of stuff.\n\n157\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.502\nYou don't remember that,\nimportant to go back and take a look.\n\n158\n00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:11.540\nThat kinda knowledge comes forward\ninto this discussion as one example.\n\n159\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.990\nWhen we use the sector browsing tool,\n\n160\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.390\nwe can go in here and\ngo find a certain sector.\n\n161\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.731\nThat's what our little tool,\nlooks like little guy walking, right?\n\n162\n00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's actually what it looks like.\n\n163\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.587\nSo we have this tool right here,\nat least, this icon.\n\n164\n00:08:22.587 --> 00:08:25.470\nI know, again,\nit's kinda hard to see if it's small.\n\n165\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.850\nBut I'm point to it right here, right?\n\n166\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.690\nSo we're gonna click there, go to Sector.\n\n167\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.440\nWe'll just move this over, so we can\nkinda see this while we're doing that.\n\n168\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.670\nWe get a little sector browser here.\n\n169\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.060\nAnd we can then go in and literally\ndecide what sector we wanna go to\n\n170\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.340\nby either having in our minds what\nthe map of the drive is or the images,\n\n171\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.420\nin this case,\ncuz it's an image of a drive.\n\n172\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.957\nWe may have used other tools to examine\nthe drive, remember, we took a look at,\n\n173\n00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:53.098\nfor instance,\nthe TSK of the sleuth tool kit, right?\n\n174\n00:08:53.098 --> 00:08:57.484\nWhere we went in, looked at F stat,\nI stat, L stat, all those tools to let us\n\n175\n00:08:57.484 --> 00:09:02.300\nexamine the files on the drive, look at\nthe partition, look at different things.\n\n176\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.812\nWe would be able to understand\nthe sectors from a tool like that.\n\n177\n00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:09.830\nSo we'd have to start using multiple tools\nin order to build out our knowledge here.\n\n178\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.650\nAnd remember, this investigative process\nis a multi-layered process, right?\n\n179\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.470\nIt's gonna be methodical,\nit's gonna be slow.\n\n180\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.270\nIt's gonna be something that we do,\n\n181\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.510\ntake the output of one tool,\none process, move to the next tool.\n\n182\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.614\nUse that as input for that process and\nslowly unwrap and unwind,\n\n183\n00:09:27.614 --> 00:09:30.894\nright, what we're doing\nto peel back the layers.\n\n184\n00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:32.150\nHave I thrown enough-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.543\n&gt;&gt; Adjectives and\n\n186\n00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:37.190\nforensic [COUGH] associations in there?\n\n187\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.120\nAnd the idea would be that ultimately,\n\n188\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.200\nwhat we are doing is we're trying\nto recreate this information,\n\n189\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.990\nbut we're doing it in reverse order,\nif you think about the logic of it.\n\n190\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.151\nWe're starting with a complete disc,\nlet's say, or a hard drive or whatever.\n\n191\n00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:55.598\nAnd we're having to then unwrap the layers\nto find the hidden information,\n\n192\n00:09:55.598 --> 00:09:57.900\nto figure out what was and was not done.\n\n193\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.916\nAnd we have to deconstruct that image,\nthat hard drive, pick apart that\n\n194\n00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:09.200\ndata one tool, one piece of information,\none mechanism, one methodology at a time.\n\n195\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.960\nUntil we can have, literally laying in\nfront of us, all the deconstructed parts,\n\n196\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.040\nand then by putting them back together\nagain, truly see how they work.\n\n197\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.666\nWhen I think about this,\nwe always do movie references,\n\n198\n00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:24.750\nin case you're just joining us brand new\nand have never seen Daniel and I before.\n\n199\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.540\nThis is a combination of Siskel and\n\n200\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.720\nEbert at the movies,\nalong with forensics investigation.\n\n201\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.434\nSo I think about the Iron Man movies,\nright, when I think about this.\n\n202\n00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:38.214\nYou have the first one or the second one,\nwhere, in particular, I think it was\n\n203\n00:10:38.214 --> 00:10:43.004\nthe second one, right, where the Mickey\nRourke character comes in, right?\n\n204\n00:10:43.004 --> 00:10:45.342\nHe has the cool electronic whips,\n\n205\n00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:49.600\ndestroys the car during the Le Mans race,\nwhatever it was.\n\n206\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.532\nAnd then Tony Stark, right,\nthe Iron Man figure,\n\n207\n00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:58.570\nRobert Downey Junior,\nhope I'm not spoiling this for anybody.\n\n208\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.440\nBut he winds up having to go through and\nconstruct this new element, right,\n\n209\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.267\nthat his father leaves\nhim the pointers to.\n\n210\n00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:12.183\nHe has the model and the whole nine yards,\nand he creates that incredible heads up,\n\n211\n00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:18.030\nkinda 3D floating in space animation,\nright, with all the cool tools they use.\n\n212\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.461\nA view of the entire overlay of the theme\npark, he winds up figuring out hey, it's\n\n213\n00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:27.030\nreally this matrix model that lets them\ncreate this new element, whatever it is.\n\n214\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.262\nAnd just think about how\nthey do that display, right,\n\n215\n00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:32.219\nat one point where he kind of figures out,\nand he throws it in the air, and\n\n216\n00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:34.420\nit's hovering there, and\nyou see all these angles.\n\n217\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.319\nI think about that when I think about this\nkind of a tool because what we're doing\n\n218\n00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:41.865\nis, if you can visualise that,\nif you close your eyes and imagine that,\n\n219\n00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:46.380\nwhat we're doing is, we're essentially\nlooking at the drive in three dimensions.\n\n220\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.090\nLooking at the space allocations, now\nwe're gonna start delving and looking at\n\n221\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.310\nthe information in there, either in the\nhex format or whatever we choose to do.\n\n222\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.028\nCould look at the offsets etc, there's\ndifferent ways, we'll see that as we go.\n\n223\n00:11:57.028 --> 00:12:01.029\nAnd what we're doing is, we're examining\nthe data, and then we're gonna create\n\n224\n00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.898\nan image that would then let us\nload that into another tool.\n\n225\n00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:07.025\nAnd actually delve through there,\npicking out those pieces,\n\n226\n00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:10.990\nlike he does where he says, look,\nJarvis or whatever the computer, right?\n\n227\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.350\nJarvis, remove the overlay\nof the pavilion fare,\n\n228\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.120\nwhat do they say, the grounds,\nthe trees, whatever it was.\n\n229\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.901\nAnd he figures out, okay, remove that.\n\n230\n00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.387\nAnd all the remaining information is\nactually the skeletal matrix, right,\n\n231\n00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:24.540\nof the image, right?\n\n232\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.092\nI just thought it was,\nthat's how my mind works anyway.\n\n233\n00:12:26.092 --> 00:12:27.470\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n234\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.733\n&gt;&gt; I see where you're going there.\n\n235\n00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:31.979\n[CROSSTALK] Engine when they kinda explode\nit out, so you can see all the parts and\n\n236\n00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:33.203\nhow they kinda fit together.\n\n237\n00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:35.810\nBut you see them individually,\ninstead of as a whole.\n\n238\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, right?\n&gt;&gt; Makes it a little easier to see\n\n239\n00:12:36.892 --> 00:12:37.530\nwhat's going on.\n\n240\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, at least for me anyway,\nit helps me to visualize what I'm doing.\n\n241\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.034\nSo if we go back and we get into\nthe [COUGH] guts of the tool here, so\n\n242\n00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:48.347\nto speak, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nput a sector in that I wanna go to.\n\n243\n00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:52.920\nSo I'm gonna jump to, let's say,\nsector two and notice when I put that in,\n\n244\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.510\njust type in at the end of that line\nthere, number two, it changes, right?\n\n245\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.020\nIt talks about or rather puts in for\nme the appropriate information.\n\n246\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.930\nIf I put this back, so\nlet me just put this back one second,\n\n247\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.120\ndo this one more time.\n\n248\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.298\nPut it back to all 0s here, you'll see\neverything is set to 0, both the byte and\n\n249\n00:13:10.298 --> 00:13:12.460\nthe sector offset information, right?\n\n250\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.770\nAnd then if I then enter number two,\nit modifies this, puts in the byte\n\n251\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:23.650\noffset in hex, right, and decimal\nequivalent or the equivalent for us.\n\n252\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.710\nAnd then once it does that,\nI can click OK,\n\n253\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.850\nand it's gonna change\nthe parameter information here.\n\n254\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.958\nNow all three sectors are marked invalid\nbecause I've changed the sector that I'm\n\n255\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:34.671\nlooking for.\n\n256\n00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:39.074\nThe boot partition is now marked as\ninvalid because I've changed the sector\n\n257\n00:13:39.074 --> 00:13:41.085\nreference that I'm looking for.\n\n258\n00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:43.695\nSo my search method, in other words,\n\n259\n00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:45.930\nhas taken me into a different\narea of the drive.\n\n260\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.899\nAnd so I'm seeing that change, but now,\n\n261\n00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:51.150\nthe exist view by itself doesn't\nreally tell us much, right?\n\n262\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.206\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go in and view, and\n\n263\n00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:57.900\nnotice I can view with hex in this\ntool as text, as a file entry.\n\n264\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.140\nI can view the boot record, I can view as\na partition table, I've different ways of\n\n265\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.830\nseeing the data in the drive,\ndepending on what I'm looking for.\n\n266\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.280\nTraditionally we would view as hex, and\n\n267\n00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.600\nthat's probably gonna look a little\nmore familiar to most of us.\n\n268\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.860\nWe've been working with hex before, some\nof our prior conversations, we've actually\n\n269\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.160\ngone in, and we've taken a look at\nthe hex data, looked at the off sets.\n\n270\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.960\nRemember, we went through and\ntracked the off sets in one of the tools.\n\n271\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.020\nSaw 0 through 15, 16 through 30,\nand we were able to set up and\n\n272\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.795\nfigure that out, when we talked about\nthe difference image types, right?\n\n273\n00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:33.491\nDaniel and I were going through and\nsaying if it's a PDF, it'll have this\n\n274\n00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:36.977\nimage offset in the beginning or\nthis offset for the first several bytes.\n\n275\n00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:38.770\nIf it's a PNG file, it'll look like this.\n\n276\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.015\nWe gave you some of those and walked\nthrough the logic of how they show up.\n\n277\n00:14:41.015 --> 00:14:45.068\nSo what we're looking at is the raw\nhex code in the drive, or at least,\n\n278\n00:14:45.068 --> 00:14:47.510\nin the area of the drive\nthat I focused on.\n\n279\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.210\nAnd so what I can do now is I can go in\nand I can select the amount of area, or\n\n280\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.350\nwhatever amount of data that I wanna use,\nto create an image.\n\n281\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.390\nRight, because now that I've laid it out,\nI've said okay, I want this.\n\n282\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.930\nBecause if you think about this, right,\nthere may be certain sectors that we wanna\n\n283\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.700\nhone in on or certain areas of\nthe drive that may be of value to us.\n\n284\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.070\nOthers, we may just not care about.\n\n285\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.990\nWe do certainly wanna take a complete\nimage of the drive, don't get me wrong.\n\n286\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.050\nBut then at that point, we may drill\nin and start imaging other sectors or\n\n287\n00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.340\nother areas to subdivide, so that we\ncan focus in and really decide, okay,\n\n288\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.140\nthis amount of data here\nlooks like it's promising.\n\n289\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.790\nThere's a sector of bad clusters\nthat seemingly have no data, but\n\n290\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.960\nwhen we examine them,\nwe find hidden data there.\n\n291\n00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.480\nLet's image that, pull that data out,\nwork with it separately, so\n\n292\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.250\nwe're not having to wade through\ngigabytes of data to get to what we want.\n\n293\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.270\nWe can just very easily filter tail or\nscope in on what we want as a subset.\n\n294\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.010\nAnd so we often will carve,\n\n295\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.060\nas we're talking about,\nthe formal term we use is file carving.\n\n296\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:49.340\nWe will often carve out these areas and\nthen create subsets of images for them.\n\n297\n00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.940\nSo I can go in here, and\nI can go and select what I want.\n\n298\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.345\nSo let's go in, and you'll see here,\nI'm just gonna do select all,\n\n299\n00:15:57.345 --> 00:15:58.570\nI'll grab all the data.\n\n300\n00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:03.107\nRight, so it selects everything that I've\nspecified, and then I can go ahead and\n\n301\n00:16:03.107 --> 00:16:04.770\nI can decide to make my image.\n\n302\n00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.302\nThis is essentially The thought\nprocess that we're going through.\n\n303\n00:16:07.302 --> 00:16:11.990\nSo, I can go in, and\nlet me go in and go to edit.\n\n304\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.050\nAnd you'll see I can do copy to file,\nright.\n\n305\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.550\nAnd when I do copy to file,\njust center this so you can see.\n\n306\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.350\nNotice down here, image data file type\n.img, that's a standard image file type.\n\n307\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.282\nAnd this is how I make that image that\nI started with that I showed you,\n\n308\n00:16:27.282 --> 00:16:29.119\nwhere I had test one and\nI split it, right?\n\n309\n00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:31.950\nSo, lets call this just so\nwe can make sure we know.\n\n310\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:38.805\nLets call this Adam Test, right, so we can\nknow for a fact, we're creating a new one.\n\n311\n00:16:38.805 --> 00:16:41.055\nAnd so I'll do that,\nthrow it on the desktop.\n\n312\n00:16:41.055 --> 00:16:42.725\nYou can throw this anywhere you want,\nobviously.\n\n313\n00:16:42.725 --> 00:16:46.295\nIf you're working on this in\na forensic work station at this point,\n\n314\n00:16:46.295 --> 00:16:47.945\nisolate it from the original.\n\n315\n00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:51.445\nYou would have your directories set up,\nyour file structure,\n\n316\n00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.235\nyou would have evidence log.\n\n317\n00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:54.395\nYou'd have everything organized.\n\n318\n00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:57.455\nYou would know where you want to put this\nin the methodology you're following.\n\n319\n00:16:57.455 --> 00:16:59.835\nSo you would just figure\nout what those policies and\n\n320\n00:16:59.835 --> 00:17:01.700\nprocedures are, act accordingly.\n\n321\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.060\nWe're just doing this in\na very straightforward,\n\n322\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.510\nreally no methodology being\napplied specifically.\n\n323\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.340\nTo say, okay,\nonly put it in this directory.\n\n324\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.840\nCall this, so we can time stamp it and\ncreate a hash.\n\n325\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.720\nAnd we obviously would do all\nthat stuff we talked about.\n\n326\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.270\nWe're just really doing this\nas a quick demonstrations, so\n\n327\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.810\nI'm throwing it on the desktop.\n\n328\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.930\nSo we're gonna click Save, and\nthen you'll see it asks me.\n\n329\n00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.090\nLet's put this over here so\nyou could see it off the background.\n\n330\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.430\nDo you wanna split the image\ninto several files?\n\n331\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.940\nThis is where we decide if we wanna split\nthat image, or we just want one big file.\n\n332\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.270\nIt's up to us to decide\nultimately how we wanna do this.\n\n333\n00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.231\nThere's no right and\nwrong by the way, right?\n\n334\n00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:38.975\nYou could do this either way,\nbut the point is,\n\n335\n00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:43.930\nif you choose to split the image, this is\nwhere you essentially get that capability.\n\n336\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.550\nAnd this is where we\nwould decide to do that.\n\n337\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.730\nSo we could click Yes,\nthat's how I did this last time.\n\n338\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.146\nYou'll see it is creating\nthe image file force.\n\n339\n00:17:51.146 --> 00:17:53.904\nIt doesn't take very long,\nit's a small amount of data, so\n\n340\n00:17:53.904 --> 00:17:56.060\nit's obviously not gonna be very big.\n\n341\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:02.420\nAnd then when we do that, we have our Adam\nTest image, the first part of that image.\n\n342\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.790\nAnd then we have the secondary image file,\nright here that goes with it.\n\n343\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.880\nWe'll just drag it down,\nso you can see it.\n\n344\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.540\nPut it over here,\njust next to the other one.\n\n345\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.420\nAnd so now we have our two images that\nhave been created, and they're split so\n\n346\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.890\nwe can manage them accordingly.\n\n347\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.480\nAnd that's how we would use a tool,\nor at least one aspect of a tool.\n\n348\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.240\nTo be able to go in and both examine the\ndata, examine the drive, look at, or using\n\n349\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.500\nour knowledge of the geometry, and the\npartitioning of the drive to examine it.\n\n350\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.610\nTo ensure we see, or don't see information\nthat we expect or don't expect to see.\n\n351\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.765\nWe could then delve in, look at sectors,\nwalk the sectors, literally,\n\n352\n00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:38.458\nfinding the one, or\nthe clusters that we want.\n\n353\n00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:40.690\nAnd then extracting\nthe data in those areas,\n\n354\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.870\ncreating an image that then allows\nus to delve in forensically.\n\n355\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.173\nAnd work more thoughtfully with\nthat data to examine it, and\n\n356\n00:18:47.173 --> 00:18:51.200\ngenerate the amount of information\nwe need to put it to our report.\n\n357\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.090\nAnd provide our findings to\nwhoever we're working for.\n\n358\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.740\nSo this will be one way that we\ncould deploy some of these tools\n\n359\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.630\nto our advantage.\n\n360\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.705\nLet's just get out of this tool.\n\n361\n00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:04.058\nOne of the things you have to remember\nabout tools like this, is if you're\n\n362\n00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:07.960\nlocking open an image that you're\nworking with like our deportation image.\n\n363\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.059\nWhen I do that, I can't open that image\nwith that image file multiple tools,\n\n364\n00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:12.765\nsimultaneously.\n\n365\n00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:15.068\nSo you'll see me close one editor,\nopening another,\n\n366\n00:19:15.068 --> 00:19:16.778\nbecause I have to free the source image.\n\n367\n00:19:16.778 --> 00:19:19.430\nI only have one copy, the image on\nthe desktop that I'm working with.\n\n368\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.185\nAnd so as a result,\nI have to literally unlock the file.\n\n369\n00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:23.665\nBecause once I unlock it open for\n\n370\n00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:27.085\nediting, I can't open it again\nuntil I close the first tool.\n\n371\n00:19:27.085 --> 00:19:29.505\nSo, you'll often see me close one,\nopen another.\n\n372\n00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.185\nAnd that's the reason, just so you know.\n\n373\n00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:34.650\nIn the real world, you would obviously\nprobably not be using multiple editors\n\n374\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.300\non one source image with\none device providing.\n\n375\n00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.960\nYou may have multiple copies of that and\nhave multiple editors running, but\n\n376\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.500\nyou do it from different images, right.\n\n377\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.270\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n378\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.960\nAll right, so let's bring front and center\nthe other tool that we wanna use here.\n\n379\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.272\nWe just went through and\ndid our Data Explorer.\n\n380\n00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:53.625\nWe're gonna go ahead now and\nwork with our AccessData FTK imager tool.\n\n381\n00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.010\nAnother tool, that more or\nless does the same thing.\n\n382\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.270\nThis one just does it from a slightly\ndifferent perspective, the GUI looks\n\n383\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.990\na little different, but at the end of\nthe day, more or less what we see.\n\n384\n00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.400\nSo let's open this tool up, give you\nan example of a couple of different ones,\n\n385\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.640\njust our Windows asking us for\nthe appropriate permissions there.\n\n386\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.520\nAll right, so\nAccessData FTK Imager, right?\n\n387\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.130\nLooks a little bit different here.\n\n388\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.857\nEvidence tree, we're hopefully\nfamiliar with the concept of this.\n\n389\n00:20:16.857 --> 00:20:21.410\nWhat we're gonna do, is go in and\nwe're going to click Add Evidence Item.\n\n390\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.169\nWe've talked about this before where we're\nbuilding our case file out, we're adding\n\n391\n00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:28.840\nevidence items, sometimes referred to as\nartifacts, by the way, just so you know.\n\n392\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.685\nSo we're gonna go ahead and add this in.\n\n393\n00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:33.920\nWe're gonna add in my image file again,\n\n394\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.400\nwe're starting from the concept of\nbeing able to use an image file.\n\n395\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.760\nBut notice, I do have the ability to\ncreate a disk image using this tool\n\n396\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.490\nas well,\njust like I did with the other one.\n\n397\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.563\nSo its not just a matter of hey,\nlet me use existing images,\n\n398\n00:20:45.563 --> 00:20:48.900\nbecause often these tools are used for\nboth sides of the divide.\n\n399\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.810\nWe can image, but\nwe can also then consume an image.\n\n400\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.350\nRemember our images may be provided by dd,\nwe talked about that.\n\n401\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.751\nIf we have a dd image,\nwe just bring it in here.\n\n402\n00:20:57.751 --> 00:21:01.387\nBecause the raw image format,\nas we talked about, is available to, and\n\n403\n00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:05.375\njust about any tool on the planet reads\nthat output of dd as a raw image file.\n\n404\n00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:09.264\nSo it's that universal imaging tool, one\nthat will create forensically sound images\n\n405\n00:21:09.264 --> 00:21:12.155\nassuming you use the right\nmethodology to create them, right?\n\n406\n00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:14.809\nWith a right blocker and\ncreate them off the machine, right,\n\n407\n00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:18.592\nwhen the machine is shut down, so\nthere's no write back, that kind of thing.\n\n408\n00:21:18.592 --> 00:21:21.609\nBut assuming you've done that,\nwe then can consume that image.\n\n409\n00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:25.194\nBut if we need to create an image\nspecific to a certain tool set,\n\n410\n00:21:25.194 --> 00:21:27.842\nor for\ncertain reasons using a specific tool.\n\n411\n00:21:27.842 --> 00:21:31.455\nAnd we talked about this as well\nwith regards to methodology,\n\n412\n00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:36.151\nyour certain tool sets are chosen\nbecause they are universally expected.\n\n413\n00:21:36.151 --> 00:21:37.374\nDD is one of those tools by the way.\n\n414\n00:21:37.374 --> 00:21:40.706\nNobody really challenged the ability\nto be able to be able to say yeah,\n\n415\n00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:42.861\nthat was an image that\nwas created properly.\n\n416\n00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:45.755\nAnd has forensicly sound\nprinciples associated with it,\n\n417\n00:21:45.755 --> 00:21:48.495\nif you use dd,\nassuming your methodology is sound, right?\n\n418\n00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:51.725\nBut the tool itself is\na universally accepted tool.\n\n419\n00:21:51.725 --> 00:21:54.465\nBut we talked about the idea\nthat some of these odd,\n\n420\n00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:57.714\noff in the corner,\nkinda tools that may not be as well known,\n\n421\n00:21:57.714 --> 00:22:01.505\nmay not have that same pedigree,\nif you will, associated with them.\n\n422\n00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:05.176\nLong-term use, thousands of trials\nwhere they've been presented,\n\n423\n00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.960\njust over and over and over again.\n\n424\n00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.353\nAnd everybody assumes that, as a result,\nthey really are gonna meet the burden and\n\n425\n00:22:11.353 --> 00:22:14.260\nthe requirements of\nstandardizing our methodology.\n\n426\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.350\nSo, you know,\nyou have to be careful about that.\n\n427\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.567\nYou have to really make wise\nchoices as we talked about.\n\n428\n00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:21.708\nSo, it may be important to use\ncertain tools and as a result,\n\n429\n00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:25.070\ncreate images with them and\nthen consume the image in them.\n\n430\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.730\nSo we streamline our process,\nfollow our methodology, and can then\n\n431\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.940\neasily report out on our findings, but\nverify that they were done a certain way.\n\n432\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.370\nAnd I've seen both of those things happen.\n\n433\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.309\nI've been involved in situations where\nI've had to go one way or the other\n\n434\n00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:42.900\nbased on either costumer requirements,\noccasionally methodology requirements.\n\n435\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.180\nJust based on the work that\nwe're being asked to do,\n\n436\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.860\nand the way that we're\nbeing asked to do it.\n\n437\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.501\nBut it's usually dealer's choice,\nmore often than not.\n\n438\n00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:53.247\nMeaning the investigator has the ability\nto choose the tools, as long as they\n\n439\n00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:57.190\nunderstand how to apply them and\nuse them with a forensically sound manner.\n\n440\n00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.060\nWe rely, in other words,\non the expertise, if you will,\n\n441\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.731\nof the investigator to make good choices,\nright.\n\n442\n00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:06.375\nThis is something that's a theme\nwe've talked about before.\n\n443\n00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:09.510\nAnd it's something you wanna just\nkeep in mind and bear in mind,\n\n444\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.570\nas you make your choices, right?\n\n445\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.620\nAgain, we're out beyond the exam at this\npoint talking about the real world now.\n\n446\n00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.420\nHow do you translate these\nskills we're talking about\n\n447\n00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.060\nfrom a theory perspective into something\nyou're gonna do in practicality, right?\n\n448\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.440\nHow do you take those skills?\n\n449\n00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.690\nHow do you walk them through\na series of tools and\n\n450\n00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.780\nactually put them to use in the field?\n\n451\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.260\nAnd this is the kinda thing that you\ngotta stop and really think about.\n\n452\n00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.400\nSo you if you join me back,\nthis is what we're talking about.\n\n453\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.720\nThe other thing I'll point out,\nwe're not gonna bother creating an image.\n\n454\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.290\nBut to show you, but you see I can also\ncapture memory using this tool, right?\n\n455\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.020\nAgain, a pretty valuable tool, because a\nlot of times we've talked about this being\n\n456\n00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.050\ndynamic or volatile nature of data,\nremember order of volatility, right?\n\n457\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.700\nWe need to be able to capture memory.\n\n458\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.355\nAnd so we may run a tool like this.\n\n459\n00:23:49.355 --> 00:23:52.262\nObviously, clearly, we would be\nrunning this on a live machine.\n\n460\n00:23:52.262 --> 00:23:55.948\nCuz we've talked about the fact that\ntraditionally you shut a machine down,\n\n461\n00:23:55.948 --> 00:23:58.058\nunless you're doing something specific.\n\n462\n00:23:58.058 --> 00:24:02.562\nLike we carved out as an exception where\nwe set a VM that you may snapshot with\n\n463\n00:24:02.562 --> 00:24:07.427\nthe memory stick captured would allow you\nto essentially capture that To a file,\n\n464\n00:24:07.427 --> 00:24:07.947\nright?\n\n465\n00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.850\nAnd then shut the VM off and\nbe able to restore it.\n\n466\n00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.260\nBut the reality is, even then,\n\n467\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.670\nyou're running that on\na machine that's turned on.\n\n468\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.550\nIt's not that you're not doing this,\nit's just you're doing it with tools that\n\n469\n00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.120\nare built in to the vendor's platform that\nallow you to extract the contents and\n\n470\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.370\nmemory because they're\nrunning somewhere else,\n\n471\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.952\nthey're running essentially on the host.\n\n472\n00:24:25.952 --> 00:24:29.620\nThey were able to gather them from there\nby carving out that memory space and\n\n473\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.540\ncapturing it to one or more files.\n\n474\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.290\nWe have to run this on a live machine.\n\n475\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.290\nThis tool has to be run against\na live environment to capture memory.\n\n476\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.380\nBut we would have the capability\nto do that, as well.\n\n477\n00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:39.910\nAnd so,\n\n478\n00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.830\nwe have a lot of different capabilities\nin a tool like this, very valuable tool.\n\n479\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.100\nWe can actually do quite a bit.\n\n480\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.940\nSo there's good stuff going on here.\n\n481\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.500\nAll right.\n\n482\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.760\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna add.\n\n483\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.340\nLet me get back over here,\nadd an evidence item.\n\n484\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.800\nAnd we get some choices here.\n\n485\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.270\nLet's just center this so\nyou could see what we're doing.\n\n486\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.480\nWe have Physical Drive,\nLogical Drive, Image File.\n\n487\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.580\nWe're gonna do Image File.\n\n488\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.170\nThat's what we've been working with.\n\n489\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.478\nClick next, we have to enter the source.\n\n490\n00:25:02.478 --> 00:25:07.701\nWe go out and browse to our desktop\nhere and we will get our partition,\n\n491\n00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:13.080\njust our departition raw image that\nwe've been using, right there.\n\n492\n00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.950\n.dd, remember, it's our DD image.\n\n493\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.180\nI click Finish.\n\n494\n00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.670\nAll right, that loads up.\n\n495\n00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.290\nYeah, we're used to seeing the hex and\nall the stuff that's associated with that.\n\n496\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.540\nThat's not gonna be unusual.\n\n497\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.140\nSo we're able to put that in and\nwe're able to then go in.\n\n498\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.430\nAnd if we go in here,\nlet's just open this up,\n\n499\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.490\nyou can kinda see it's an NTFS\npartition figures that out.\n\n500\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.550\nBy the way, we can see that just sitting\nright down here in the hex and here in\n\n501\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:41.970\nthe blocks right down there at the very,\nvery first area right all zeros right so.\n\n502\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.860\nNo offset there.\n\n503\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.710\nWe're just able to see it.\n\n504\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.390\nThe very beginning of the drive tells\nus that it's an NTFS partition.\n\n505\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.290\nSo let me just go back up here.\n\n506\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.840\nAnd under drive, we've got, under\nroute got a whole bunch of stuff here.\n\n507\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.840\nAnd we've done some of this before.\n\n508\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.630\nWe have our recycle bin for any users.\n\n509\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.830\nThat would've been on there\nevery user has their own unique\n\n510\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.940\nGUID associated with the recycle bin for\ntheir user profile.\n\n511\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.680\nSo, if we were to take a look\nwe could see every user's,\n\n512\n00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.980\nlet's kind of move this over so\nyou can see the string there.\n\n513\n00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.764\nEvery user in the system would\nhave a unique identifier there.\n\n514\n00:26:14.764 --> 00:26:16.048\nThis ends in 500.\n\n515\n00:26:16.048 --> 00:26:18.940\nDo we know what that tells us?\n\n516\n00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.590\nYou show know what that does.\n\n517\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it's an administrator.\n\n518\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.220\n&gt;&gt; That's the admin one, right?\n\n519\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.900\nThe 500 is always the admin ,we\nsee it at the end of the GUID.\n\n520\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.100\nSecurity identifier means,\n500 means, admin of 501 means guest.\n\n521\n00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.030\nSo we would be able to see those and\nknow what those are.\n\n522\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:37.740\nSo we could tell without even necessarily\ndoing anything that that is the admin\n\n523\n00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.840\nuser account that would have been logged\nin at some point on this machine.\n\n524\n00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.280\nAlso tells us there have been no other\nusers logged in cuz we have no other\n\n525\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.165\nprofiles that would exist or\nwe would see a recycle bin association.\n\n526\n00:26:47.165 --> 00:26:50.655\nWe may not be able to tell based on\nthe identifier what user account it is cuz\n\n527\n00:26:50.655 --> 00:26:51.315\nthe rest of them.\n\n528\n00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:52.935\nWe would have to go look up and\n\n529\n00:26:52.935 --> 00:26:57.200\nhack out of the SAM hive to figure out\nwhat the GUID's are and associate them.\n\n530\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.498\nBut 500 is the universal,\nit's always the admin account.\n\n531\n00:26:59.498 --> 00:27:02.014\nWe can tell that this machine\nhas been interacted with.\n\n532\n00:27:02.014 --> 00:27:04.709\nThat somebody has logged on to it but\nall we know is for\n\n533\n00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:06.378\nsure an admin account was used.\n\n534\n00:27:06.378 --> 00:27:09.781\nWe don't know the password,\nI'm not suggesting we're gonna get all\n\n535\n00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.492\nthe information you need just\nby accessing the drive but\n\n536\n00:27:12.492 --> 00:27:16.068\nI am suggesting that a smart forensic\ninvestigator that pays attention to\n\n537\n00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:19.750\nthe subtle details here can glean\na lot of information just by looking.\n\n538\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.980\nBy the way, so can hackers.\n\n539\n00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.560\nIf we flip this on its ear for\na minute, go back to our CEH roots.\n\n540\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.250\nCertified Ethical Hacker.\n\n541\n00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.180\nDo you think hackers use tools like this?\n\n542\n00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.930\nI mean, obviously, clearly.\n\n543\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.800\nIf they can get an image of the drive,\nthey've already touched the machine.\n\n544\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.680\nI'm not suggesting this is a front\nline mechanism for hackers,\n\n545\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.920\nlooking to get access to user accounts.\n\n546\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.180\nBut I'm just suggesting that,\nif they can get in,\n\n547\n00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.480\nand they can find all\nsorts of information.\n\n548\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.650\nThere's a variety of tools\nthat hackers have access to.\n\n549\n00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.040\nThey have access to all\nthe same tools we use,\n\n550\n00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.700\nas security professionals, as defenders,\nas forensic investigators.\n\n551\n00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.920\nHackers aren't dumb.\n\n552\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.780\nThey read the same books, they watch the\nsame interactive learning environments,\n\n553\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.540\nand do all the same kind\nof things that we do.\n\n554\n00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.340\nBecause they wanna know what we're doing,\n\n555\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.400\nso that they can take\nadvantage of that knowledge.\n\n556\n00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.460\nThat's why we have to think like them,\nright?\n\n557\n00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.210\nAnd they've mastered the art\nof thinking like us.\n\n558\n00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.740\nThey understand how to be really in tune\nwith all the defensive measures that\n\n559\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.590\nare being put in place, so\nthat they can overcome them.\n\n560\n00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.105\nThe best defense you often hear\npeople say is a good offense.\n\n561\n00:28:18.105 --> 00:28:21.782\nThe security professional today,\nthe forensic investigator of today has\n\n562\n00:28:21.782 --> 00:28:24.186\nto really understand\nthe mindset of the hacker.\n\n563\n00:28:24.186 --> 00:28:28.257\nThe bad actor, the threat sources we call\nthem, because that's where we're going to\n\n564\n00:28:28.257 --> 00:28:32.410\nspending a lot of our time investigating\nthe activities of these individuals.\n\n565\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.530\nAnd the more we know about them,\nthe more we look in the mirror and\n\n566\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.850\nsee that they are us, and we are them.\n\n567\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.910\nThe self awareness concept\nbecomes very important here.\n\n568\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.225\nBecause the more we can put ourselves\ninto that mindset, the more likely it is\n\n569\n00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:47.336\nwe're gonna understand the things we see,\nand the advantage that those\n\n570\n00:28:47.336 --> 00:28:50.716\nthings might give somebody to then put\ntogether other pieces of information.\n\n571\n00:28:50.716 --> 00:28:51.940\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n572\n00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.420\nAll right, so we've got that here.\n\n573\n00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.290\nGo back over here.\n\n574\n00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.660\nWe could be looking at all sorts of stuff.\n\n575\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.190\nWe do have your various files here.\n\n576\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.010\nThere's just all sorts of\nthings that may show up.\n\n577\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.276\nWe have unallocated space.\n\n578\n00:29:04.276 --> 00:29:09.260\nWe could see that for instance,\nif we wanted to take a look.\n\n579\n00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.140\nWe can go in.\n\n580\n00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.960\nAnd we can see that we may\nhave orphaned information.\n\n581\n00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.462\nMay or may not.\nWe may have video, may have song files,\n\n582\n00:29:19.462 --> 00:29:22.080\nmay have whatever the case may be.\n\n583\n00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.460\nThere's some images there.\n\n584\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.780\nWe have a whole bunch of images there.\n\n585\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.730\nSo there's a whole bunch of\ndifferent stuff up under extended.\n\n586\n00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.860\nWe have some metadata information there.\n\n587\n00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.360\nThere's a lot of different stuff.\n\n588\n00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.603\nThat's the bad cluster information,\nthat's the bad cluster file for\n\n589\n00:29:35.603 --> 00:29:38.233\nNTFS that we looked at\nwith the iStat tooll.\n\n590\n00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:40.160\nNo bad clusters, we noticed.\n\n591\n00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.390\nWe've been examining this image,\ntaking a look at it.\n\n592\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.110\nBut if we had bad clusters,\nwe'd be able to see them there and\n\n593\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.160\nwe'd be able to go in and\nobviously find information right?\n\n594\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.220\nSo we're using this tool,\nessentially in the same kind of way.\n\n595\n00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.180\nWe're just examining the drive.\n\n596\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.700\nThis is the same thing we just\nlooked at with the NTFS explorer,\n\n597\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.638\njust from a different perspective right?\n\n598\n00:29:57.638 --> 00:30:00.590\nSo we could use the same kind of tools and\n\n599\n00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.850\ngo through and\nfind multiple pieces of information.\n\n600\n00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.100\nThey almost, without exception, overlap.\n\n601\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.750\nIs it a good idea from a methodology\nperspective to use more than one tool\n\n602\n00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.900\nto verify and validate that\nthe information's being read the same way?\n\n603\n00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.520\nYeah, normally, 99.9 times out of 100,\nyou're not gonna see variation, but\n\n604\n00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.650\nthe idea is that every so often,\na tool may do something quirky and\n\n605\n00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.080\nor one tool may find something\nthat another tools may not.\n\n606\n00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.510\nAnd I'll show you this in some upcoming\nconversations when we talk about\n\n607\n00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.250\ndefeating and\nworking with antiforensics tools and\n\n608\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.940\nwe look at steganography as\nan antiforensics measure for\n\n609\n00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.860\ninstance and we'll take a look at\nthe fact that certain stego tools,\n\n610\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.010\ntools that detect steganography may find\nstenography applied to certain files.\n\n611\n00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.629\nBut they may not find there another even\nthough the file has been stenographically\n\n612\n00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:48.042\nmodified because the tool's\ndesigned to only look for\n\n613\n00:30:48.042 --> 00:30:49.570\ncertain kinds of modifications.\n\n614\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.830\nIt's not a broad spectrum tool but\nmaybe narrowly defined.\n\n615\n00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:57.170\nAnd if we're not aware of that, we may\nfind or not find things that we expect or\n\n616\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.330\ndon't expect to see.\n\n617\n00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.060\nSo cross referencing and\nrevalidating knowledge and\n\n618\n00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.432\ndata would be really important.\n\n619\n00:31:03.432 --> 00:31:06.098\nWe wanna know and\nunderstand what we're looking at.\n\n620\n00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:09.850\nIt would be very helpful for\nus to do that.\n\n621\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.910\nSo you can see.\n\n622\n00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.880\nThere maybe in this case,\nsome PDFs that you could see there.\n\n623\n00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.800\nRight there's a PDF that I'm looking at.\n\n624\n00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.030\nAnd I may be able to highlight that,\nfind some information about it.\n\n625\n00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.880\nI could export the file\nas you'll see right here.\n\n626\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.620\nI can add it to an image so\nI could put it into an image.\n\n627\n00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.972\nI can create a hash for it.\n\n628\n00:31:26.972 --> 00:31:30.930\nI could grab that file, export it out,\nand then interact with it.\n\n629\n00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.882\nI could grab it right out of\nthe image If I wanted to.\n\n630\n00:31:32.882 --> 00:31:35.290\nI could go do something like that.\n\n631\n00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.060\nPut that there.\n\n632\n00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.870\nLet's see if we got anything.\n\n633\n00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.210\nThere it is right there.\n\n634\n00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.950\nAnd I could then grab that PDF.\n\n635\n00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.150\nIt's that simple on\nthe forensic workstation.\n\n636\n00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.804\nI could actually go in and I could grab\na file right out of the Drive Image.\n\n637\n00:31:48.804 --> 00:31:50.210\nYou saw me mount it.\n\n638\n00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:54.760\nAnd I'm able to reproduce that file by\ngoing in, reading the associated data.\n\n639\n00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.560\nAnd literally reaching into the pool and\npulling out that one little file and\n\n640\n00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.170\ndropping it on the desktop for\nfurther investigation.\n\n641\n00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.520\nSo this is the value of some of these\ntools in terms of data acquisition,\n\n642\n00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.020\ndata duplication.\n\n643\n00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.700\nYou saw me be able to\ncreate the images down\n\n644\n00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.720\nhere with the duplication thought process.\n\n645\n00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.750\nYou saw me do the acquisition right\nnow in a couple of different venues,\n\n646\n00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.890\nin a couple of different ways,\nusing a couple of different tools.\n\n647\n00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n648\n00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.350\nDefinitely, this is what we wanna\nbe able to do so that we can,\n\n649\n00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:29.530\nas Adam has been saying, work with\nthe files in a forensically sound way.\n\n650\n00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.330\nSo that we do not cause problems,\n\n651\n00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:37.460\nwe wanna be able to work with those\nthings without actually modifying or\n\n652\n00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.770\ndoing any kind of integrity damaging\n[LAUGH] things to the original.\n\n653\n00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.160\nSo now we've gotta get\nup a couple of tools.\n\n654\n00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.620\nYou've seen how we can do that.\n\n655\n00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.440\nI'm sure there are a bevy of others out\nthere so these aren't to your likings,\n\n656\n00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.100\nfind one that you do like and\nworks wells for you.\n\n657\n00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.750\nBut other than that, this is the process,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n658\n00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.324\nThat being said,\nI'm looking at the clock and\n\n659\n00:32:58.324 --> 00:33:00.908\nour process of doing a show\nhas run out of time.\n\n660\n00:33:00.908 --> 00:33:04.071\nWe'll have to come back for\nmore in future episodes, but as for\n\n661\n00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:06.810\nthis episode it looks like we are done for\nthe day.\n\n662\n00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.050\nThank you for joining us.\n\n663\n00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.910\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n664\n00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.225\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon,\nthat data acquisition guy.\n\n665\n00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:14.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n666\n00:33:14.988 --> 00:33:15.866\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n667\n00:33:15.866 --> 00:33:22.066\n[MUSIC]\n\n668\n00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:25.650\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.006\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:13.959\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.750\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.640\nin today’s episode, we are back with\nmore on our CHFI Series Version 9.\n\n8\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.830\nAnd joining us, yet again, our good\nfriend and mentor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.950\nAdam, glad to have you, man.\n\n10\n00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.630\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.445\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, it is going well.\n\n12\n00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.022\nHopefully it's going well for all of you.\n\n13\n00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:34.070\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\nas Daniel was suggesting,\n\n14\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.790\nswitching our topic and focus.\n\n15\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.050\nWe decided it would be great to talk about\nall that other stuff we've done already,\n\n16\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.280\nbut you know what,\nwe already did all that.\n\n17\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.050\nSo we're gonna talk about something new.\n\n18\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.540\nIf you haven't seen all that stuff, by the\nway, especially the last several episodes\n\n19\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.150\nwe just put together prior to this topic\nthat we're about to start in on for\n\n20\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.660\nyou about data acquisition duplication.\n\n21\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.310\nThe ability to go out and use imaging\ntools, tools like the NTFS disk explorer,\n\n22\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.980\ntools like accesses,\nFTK, disk imaging tool.\n\n23\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.555\nTo be able to go out and look at the raw\ndata, pull files out if necessary,\n\n24\n00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:07.430\ncreate images if necessary.\n\n25\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.235\nAll sorts of capabilities that\ninvestigators would need to be able to\n\n26\n00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:13.150\ndeploy during an investigation.\n\n27\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.282\nAnd certainly, the value of that hopefully\nis readily apparent to you by this point\n\n28\n00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:18.470\nin our conversations.\n\n29\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.090\nBut important to go back, take a look.\n\n30\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.640\nRemember, especially if you're planning\non getting ready for the CHFI exam,\n\n31\n00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.750\nit is very important to go through\nall of the episodes we put together.\n\n32\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.944\nWe're highlighting and\n\n33\n00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:31.680\nzeroing in on pieces of\ninformation in every one of them.\n\n34\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.740\nSometimes they're hidden and\nhard to find, others, readily apparent.\n\n35\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.890\nBut there is critical information in\nevery one, with regards to exam material,\n\n36\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.870\nexam preparation, things you'd wanna know,\nand of course, taken as a whole overall.\n\n37\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.710\nGreat amount of knowledge you can then\ntransfer to the real world to hone your\n\n38\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.340\nskills and continue to add to your\ncapabilities as a forensic investigator.\n\n39\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580\nWe're gonna talk about\ndefeating anti-forensics and\n\n40\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.350\nthe techniques associated with doing that,\nan interesting and\n\n41\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.910\ngrowing area of the forensics\ninvestigative process.\n\n42\n00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.612\nI mentioned this in our last set of\nepisodes when I made the reference to\n\n43\n00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.460\ncertified ethical hacking a little bit,\nanother area, another exam.\n\n44\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.226\nAnother body of knowledge UC Council has\nbeen very generous in putting together and\n\n45\n00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.750\nputting out there for us.\n\n46\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.820\nSkills that either defensive\nsecurity professionals will use\n\n47\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.700\nto be able to better understand and\ndefend their networks,\n\n48\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.950\nbased on what the mindset\nof the hacker is.\n\n49\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.020\nWe've also, of course, always talked about\nthe fact that those are skills that,\n\n50\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.020\nin the wrong hands,\ncan be turned against you and\n\n51\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.110\nbe used offensively to try to break in.\n\n52\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.860\nBut I made the connection, and I've made\nit in several places in our conversations.\n\n53\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.456\nI will continue to up through\nthe remainder of our shows in episodes in\n\n54\n00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:36.390\nthis area.\n\n55\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.971\nThat the mindset of the hacker is what\nthe investigator needs to adopt and\n\n56\n00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.610\nunderstand in order to better do our job.\n\n57\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.105\nAnd ultimately, to understand and\nto figure out what the approaches were, or\n\n58\n00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.644\nhave been, or will be that the bad actor,\nthe threat source,\n\n59\n00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:55.253\nmay have deployed in order to\ncarry out the attack in question,\n\n60\n00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:58.590\none where most likely being\nasked to investigate.\n\n61\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.190\nAnd remember,\nthe majority of our job as investigators,\n\n62\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.680\nwe talked about this in some\nof our earliest episodes.\n\n63\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.225\nWe laid out the background thought\nprocess of the investigative idea, and\n\n64\n00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:11.455\nthe investigative process and methodology\nis really that, almost without exception.\n\n65\n00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:15.809\nEverything we do is traditionally seen as\nbeing reactive because we're called in\n\n66\n00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:16.700\nafter the fact.\n\n67\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.570\nRight, this is what the role,\ntraditionally, of an investigator will be.\n\n68\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.910\nShow up and do essentially forensic,\n\n69\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.430\ngenerally forensic based\nincident response.\n\n70\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.460\nAnd as a result of that, we have to be\nthinking that we really traditionally do\n\n71\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.790\nnot get to see information,\ndo not get to interact with systems\n\n72\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.950\nin the traditional scope of our job,\nunless something bad has already happened.\n\n73\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.871\nThat's not to say we shouldn't be\nproactive, and I made the connection for\n\n74\n00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:46.099\nyou before that the proactive portion of\nour job in the real world as investigators\n\n75\n00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.018\nis to take the lessons learned from all\nof that reactive experience we have to\n\n76\n00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:50.650\nengage in.\n\n77\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.758\nAll that incident response we do,\nroll that forward,\n\n78\n00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:55.930\npay that forward if you will, right?\n\n79\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.350\nTo the benefit of the organization,\nthe benefit of the customer,\n\n80\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.950\nthe benefit of the entity that you\nhave done the work on behalf of, and\n\n81\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.805\nperhaps even more broadly,\nother entities at large.\n\n82\n00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:10.513\nBecause we will see, time and again, that\nthe lessons learned in the post mortem or\n\n83\n00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:15.358\nthe PIR, post implementation review, or\nwhatever you call that, after the facts,\n\n84\n00:04:15.358 --> 00:04:19.866\nsit down, and documentation and gathering\nof the ability to, in other words,\n\n85\n00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.982\nreflect and look back on what we did.\n\n86\n00:04:21.982 --> 00:04:25.260\nAnd roll that forward through\nour output report, becomes so\n\n87\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.972\ncentral to what we have to\ndo to close out the case.\n\n88\n00:04:27.972 --> 00:04:32.821\nBut also becomes a great opportunity for\nus to proactively make\n\n89\n00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:36.921\nrecommendations to people that can either\nchange the way they are doing things.\n\n90\n00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:40.281\nIf we broaden that or perhaps\npublish a paper about a new attack,\n\n91\n00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:44.769\nor a new piece of malware, or new\nmethodologies, or who knows what, right?\n\n92\n00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.001\nThen we may be able to make that a lot\nmore broadly available, and therefore,\n\n93\n00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:49.581\nmore people can benefit from that.\n\n94\n00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.923\nOr it may just be\nsomething done internally.\n\n95\n00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:54.175\nRemember, we talked about the different\nkinds of cases, criminal, civil, and\n\n96\n00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:55.460\nadministrative.\n\n97\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.260\nLaid those out in our extensive\nconversations around the methodology\n\n98\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.200\nof investigation and\n\n99\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.390\nwhat we need to do to prepare and\nthe different ways in which we do that.\n\n100\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.930\nAnd so as a result, we may be\nlooking at administrative actions,\n\n101\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.170\nactions that are traditionally\nfocused internally in one company.\n\n102\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.930\nThey may have received a lot of data,\nthey may even go before a court of law,\n\n103\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.130\nwe may never involve external\nlaw enforcement agencies.\n\n104\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.250\nThat doesn't mean we can't\nlearn from those experiences.\n\n105\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.210\nIt doesn't mean that as an investigator,\nwe cannot contribute positively to\n\n106\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.520\nthe security stance and\nthe re-architecturing of that stance.\n\n107\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.459\nIn the organization based on the skills,\nbased on the knowledge, and\n\n108\n00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:34.550\nbased on the understanding of\nthe methodologies that we are using.\n\n109\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.680\nSo it's really important for\n\n110\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.720\nus to always have this in mind\nas a forensic investigator.\n\n111\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.439\nWe do, almost without exception,\nact in that reactive space, but\n\n112\n00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:44.890\nwe have a very important contribution.\n\n113\n00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.840\nWe make proactively by taking the output\nof that reactive investigation,\n\n114\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.832\nthat reactive in certain response,\nand then rolling that forward.\n\n115\n00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:55.682\nAnd it's a very important real\nworld distinction for you,\n\n116\n00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:59.615\nbecause what often happens is people come\ninto this line of work, thinking well,\n\n117\n00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:00.877\nthis is all I'm gonna do.\n\n118\n00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:04.020\nI'm gonna just show up and\nclean up the bodies, quote unquote.\n\n119\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.410\nRight, I'm just gonna be\nthat instant response.\n\n120\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.620\nDid you ever see just one of those\ncrazy shows that I've never watched,\n\n121\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.570\nbut I've heard about?\n\n122\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.880\nThere was a show, I don't know\nif it was on HBO or Netflix or\n\n123\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.800\nwhere it was, where they had this group of\ntwo people that had this clean up service.\n\n124\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.424\nSomebody would get killed, and\nremember they would get called in.\n\n125\n00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:22.493\n&gt;&gt; I vaguely remember,\nI've never seen it, but I remember, yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:23.759\nIt was a cleaning company.\n\n127\n00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, literally, they would show up and\n\n128\n00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.066\nclean up the room after\nthe butchery took place.\n\n129\n00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:32.320\n&gt;&gt; I believe it was called service\nmasters [LAUGH] back in the day.\n\n130\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.865\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it was, right?\n\n131\n00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:37.068\nI don't know why that popped into my\nhead right now with that respect or\n\n132\n00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:38.167\nthat thought process.\n\n133\n00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:42.826\nBut that idea of saying, this is all I do,\nI just clean up other people's messes.\n\n134\n00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:46.680\nYeah, that's quite, quite far from\nwhat we actually do in the real world.\n\n135\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.700\nWe do a lot of stuff.\n\n136\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.030\nI'm asked all the time to be on\nthe other side of that divide.\n\n137\n00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.590\nAnd sit proactively in\nconversations with customers,\n\n138\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.560\nwith students,\nwith people that I have to give advice to.\n\n139\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.120\nOr I have to help figure out\nhow to solve problems around.\n\n140\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.200\nUsing a multiple set of skills that I have\nas a security professional, that I have\n\n141\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.710\nas a network administrator, as an IT\nprofessional, and bring those to bear.\n\n142\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.960\nSo I get to do a lot of these things.\n\n143\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.380\nYou may not do all of them, but that\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't be looking for\n\n144\n00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.400\nopportunities to share that knowledge,\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n145\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.610\nHaving said that, the anti-forensics\nthought process, commonly and\n\n146\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.600\nalso more properly known\nas counter forensics.\n\n147\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.292\nThat's what we often hear it referred to\nas, is a set of techniques that attackers\n\n148\n00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:32.984\nare gonna use, as we suggested, to break\nthe forensics cycle to make it harder for\n\n149\n00:07:32.984 --> 00:07:34.900\nus to do our investigative work.\n\n150\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.608\nTo hide, obfuscate,\nsomehow modify, manipulate,\n\n151\n00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:44.290\nwe can put all these adjectives and verbs\nassociated with these actions on top.\n\n152\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.569\nBut ultimately, what we're doing is as\na counter forensics practitioner, ie,\n\n153\n00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.119\na bad actor or threat source,\n\n154\n00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:54.287\nwe are trying to figure out ways to hide\nour activities from the investigators.\n\n155\n00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:57.678\nAnd make sure they don't know what we\ndid and make it incredibly difficult for\n\n156\n00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:58.676\nthem to figure it out.\n\n157\n00:07:58.676 --> 00:08:02.450\nNow keep in mind that as a security\nprofessional Our goal is not\n\n158\n00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.310\nnecessarily to solve every crime,\nour goal is not to prevent every attack.\n\n159\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.454\nThat's a lofty goal,\nwe should have that out there,\n\n160\n00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.706\nit should be a light in\nthe distance where we strive for.\n\n161\n00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:15.394\nBut it's unrealistic to say we're\ngonna get there very often, if at all.\n\n162\n00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:20.280\nOn a consistent and standardized and\nrepeatable, verifiable, auditable basis.\n\n163\n00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.251\nWhat often happens is,\nwe have moments of brilliance,\n\n164\n00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:26.108\nfollowed by the drudgery of\ndoing our work every day.\n\n165\n00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:30.117\nAnd so we have to understand,\nthat while we have that endgame goal?\n\n166\n00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:34.279\nIt is most likely that we are going to,\nif we are doing this in a correct way,\n\n167\n00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:37.139\na smart way,\na way that is realistic to implement.\n\n168\n00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:39.743\nOur goal, as the defender,\nis not to stop every attack,\n\n169\n00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:41.498\nbecause that is highly unrealistic.\n\n170\n00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:45.474\nBut rather, our goal should be to prevent\nthe attacks that are most common,\n\n171\n00:08:45.474 --> 00:08:47.912\nthat are obvious,\nthat we can get in front of.\n\n172\n00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:50.923\nMinimize and mitigate is what\nwe often talk about, right?\n\n173\n00:08:50.923 --> 00:08:53.885\nOne of the ways to deal with risk,\nwe should be thinking about doing that.\n\n174\n00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.369\nBut we have to understand that\na percentage of those attacks,\n\n175\n00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.582\nzero-day exploits,\nadvanced persistent threats.\n\n176\n00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:02.377\nThat we may not have defense against,\nbecause vendors have not put out patches.\n\n177\n00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:04.561\nWe have no understanding\nof the methodology,\n\n178\n00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:08.520\nthere's all these reasons why things\nmay sneak by us, all the time.\n\n179\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.730\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n180\n00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.710\nwe have to understand that a percentage\nof those attacks will be successful.\n\n181\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.997\nWe shouldn't sit in our cube and\nbemoan our fate,\n\n182\n00:09:14.997 --> 00:09:17.023\nthat we're not able to\ndo our job properly.\n\n183\n00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:20.199\nRather, we have to understand that\nit's our job to get out there and\n\n184\n00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.267\nstop as much as we can.\n\n185\n00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:24.977\nKnowing that certain things will get\nthrough, but instead of saying, no, okay,\n\n186\n00:09:24.977 --> 00:09:25.984\nI can't do anything.\n\n187\n00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:29.231\nLet's do what we can, but let's make\nit difficult for people to get in.\n\n188\n00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:31.906\nAnd so as a result,\nit's delay and deter, and\n\n189\n00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.850\nthat's the methodology that we talk about.\n\n190\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.210\nAnd as a result of delay and deter,\n\n191\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.169\nwe're thinking about the idea that\nfrom an anti-forensics perspective.\n\n192\n00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:42.990\nThe bad actor's trying to get\nthrough our defenses, break in.\n\n193\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.786\nWe go back to this idea of defense and\ndepth,\n\n194\n00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:46.494\nyou've heard me talk about this before.\n\n195\n00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:49.236\nIt's the idea of these concentric rings or\ncircles, right,\n\n196\n00:09:49.236 --> 00:09:50.984\nthat are layered one on top of another.\n\n197\n00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:54.726\nThink of a target, literally like\na archery target or a bulls-eye,\n\n198\n00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:56.863\nwith multiple rings propagating out.\n\n199\n00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:59.269\nThe idea would be,\nthat if we sit at the most inner layer,\n\n200\n00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:01.289\nthe bulls-eye at the middle\nof the dartboard.\n\n201\n00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:03.810\nAnd that's where our most\nsensitive information is,\n\n202\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.353\nour most protected systems are.\n\n203\n00:10:05.353 --> 00:10:09.512\nAnd there's five or six external rings we\nhave to navigate through, as a bad actor,\n\n204\n00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:10.400\nto get in.\n\n205\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.490\nI may be successful eventually,\nchipping away,\n\n206\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.020\nbreaking through all of them,\nthat's not really the issue.\n\n207\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.600\nThe issue is,\nwill you find me in the process,\n\n208\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.770\ndo I leave behind enough\nevidence that you can track back?\n\n209\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.100\nDo I leave behind enough information\nthat points to what I was doing, or\n\n210\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.750\nwhere I was going?\n\n211\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.857\nOr was it able to get in and\nout, without you finding me?\n\n212\n00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:33.359\nAnd if we delay and deter,\nmore often than not, as a defender.\n\n213\n00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:36.162\nWhat we are trying to do it to\nmake it just difficult enough,\n\n214\n00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:38.440\nthat it's going to take you extra time.\n\n215\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.530\nAnd the thought process is,\n\n216\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.880\nif we have enough of that extra time added\non, think of it as penalty time, right?\n\n217\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.563\nAlmost like you're a sports fan, right?\n\n218\n00:10:44.563 --> 00:10:46.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; An extra couple of minutes in\n\n219\n00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:49.164\na soccer game, abrogated at the end for\npenalty time, right?\n\n220\n00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:52.524\nYou get an extra minute or\ntwo with somebody off the ice, in hockey.\n\n221\n00:10:52.524 --> 00:10:55.674\nSomebody gets thrown in the penalty box,\nand you're up one person or\n\n222\n00:10:55.674 --> 00:10:56.930\nsomething like that.\n\n223\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.938\nAll these different scenarios,\nwhatever it is, you have an advantage,\n\n224\n00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:01.257\nsomebody else has a detriment.\n\n225\n00:11:01.257 --> 00:11:04.706\nMy goal as a security professional,\nas a forensic investigator,\n\n226\n00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.060\nis to make it difficult enough for\nyou to act.\n\n227\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.230\nIn the way you wanna act as a bad actor,\nusing anti-forensics or\n\n228\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.710\ncounter-forensics tools.\n\n229\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.068\nThat I'm not gonna stop you, necessarily?\n\n230\n00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:16.925\nBut I am gonna find evidence\nof what you did, and\n\n231\n00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:19.450\nfind you before you can be successful.\n\n232\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.850\nOr even if you're successful,\nyou're gonna leave behind enough evidence.\n\n233\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.912\nAnd enough broken branches and\nenough footprints, right,\n\n234\n00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:27.722\nto kinda broaden that analogy out.\n\n235\n00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:31.916\nBecause I made it so difficult for\nyou to navigate that I forced you, right?\n\n236\n00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:35.187\nTo leave something behind,\nthat will become evidence that I can find.\n\n237\n00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:38.742\nI can figure out, I can track you with,\nthen i'm gonna be able to find you.\n\n238\n00:11:38.742 --> 00:11:42.488\nAnd so it's about hunting down these bad\nactors, because we make the course so\n\n239\n00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:44.090\ndifficult for them to navigate.\n\n240\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.546\nThis is the idea, that we have to\nthink of from a defense perspective,\n\n241\n00:11:47.546 --> 00:11:49.964\nwhen we start talking\nabout counter forensics.\n\n242\n00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:53.483\nObviously from the offense perspective,\ncounter forensics is all about, hey,\n\n243\n00:11:53.483 --> 00:11:55.626\nI'm gonna use this tool and\nstealth my identity.\n\n244\n00:11:55.626 --> 00:11:57.115\nAnd hopefully you're not gonna find me.\n\n245\n00:11:57.115 --> 00:12:02.109\nSo I'll deploy maybe an atomizer,\na proxy, a NATing kind of device.\n\n246\n00:12:02.109 --> 00:12:08.384\nThat stealths and cloaks my origination\nIP address, my origination geo-location.\n\n247\n00:12:08.384 --> 00:12:11.547\nI'll make it look like I'm coming\nout of Romania, when in fact,\n\n248\n00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:13.281\nI'm sitting over somewhere else.\n\n249\n00:12:13.281 --> 00:12:16.795\nIn may be Brazil, or the Côte d'Ivoire,\nor wherever it may be.\n\n250\n00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:20.867\nAnd I'm gonna run that system trace\nthrough so many scrubbers, and\n\n251\n00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:23.161\natomizers, and different systems.\n\n252\n00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:27.070\nThat it's gonna be very difficult for you\nto walk it back and truly find me, right?\n\n253\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.830\nAnd so that's the kind of thing\nthat the computer genius, right?\n\n254\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.611\nThe people that are the bad actors,\nthat know how to do this and do this well,\n\n255\n00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.628\nthat practice counter forensics,\nare looking to do.\n\n256\n00:12:35.628 --> 00:12:38.945\nIt's up to us, the computer geniuses\non the defense team, right,\n\n257\n00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:41.582\nthe investigators and\nthe security professionals.\n\n258\n00:12:41.582 --> 00:12:43.708\nTo say, no, not today,\nnot in my house, right?\n\n259\n00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:47.158\nAnd we have to make sure that it's\ngonna maybe be successful, but\n\n260\n00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.740\nit's gonna be painful for\nyou to be successful.\n\n261\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.010\nAnd that pain is gonna translate\ninto us ultimately unmasking you.\n\n262\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.800\nAnd that's our goal here, so\nthe goals of anti-forensics, interpret and\n\n263\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.660\nprevent information collection.\n\n264\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.980\nToughen the investigator's task,\nright, in finding the evidence.\n\n265\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.324\nRemember, these are the goals that the\npeople that practice the anti-forensics\n\n266\n00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:06.350\nare looking to achieve.\n\n267\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.101\nThey're looking to make it difficult for\nus to try to do our job.\n\n268\n00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:11.758\nHide traces of crime or illegal activity,\n\n269\n00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.561\nwe've talked about all\nthese things before.\n\n270\n00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:16.790\nDelete evidence that the anti-forensic\ntools have been used.\n\n271\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.150\nRemove the anonymizer, remove the back\ndoor RAT, the Remote Access Trojan.\n\n272\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.900\nRemove the keylogger, whatever it is\nwe put in the system to get in, right?\n\n273\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.233\nGet in, do what we need to do, get out,\nand then remove, on our way out,\n\n274\n00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:30.069\nall evidence of that having been done.\n\n275\n00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:32.352\nBut a lot of times,\nremember more and more today.\n\n276\n00:13:32.352 --> 00:13:36.776\nWe're seeing throwaway and disposable\nsystems being used as launching pads for\n\n277\n00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:37.695\nthese attacks.\n\n278\n00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:41.834\nWhat I mean by that in just plain\nlanguage is, we're seeing, essentially,\n\n279\n00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.032\nvirtual images spun up in\nthe cloud as an orbital platform.\n\n280\n00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:49.161\nThat can be used from any vantage point on\nthe globe, to be able to launch attacks.\n\n281\n00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:52.912\nAnd then those virtual images are simply\ndestroyed when the attacker is done.\n\n282\n00:13:52.912 --> 00:13:57.470\nRemoving all, at least in theory,\nmost trace evidence of the attack.\n\n283\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.600\nNow keep in mind, this gets into\nthe cloud forensics conversation,\n\n284\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.580\nwe'll have that in upcoming conversations.\n\n285\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.640\nVery interesting set of\ndiscussions we'll have there.\n\n286\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.040\nWhat are the cloud service offerings,\nsoftware as a service,\n\n287\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.120\nplatform as a service, IaaS,\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n288\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.521\nWhat are the service, or rather, service\nmodels, right, what are the frameworks,\n\n289\n00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.534\npublic, private, community, hybrid, cloud?\n\n290\n00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:18.937\nBut ultimately, aside from all the basics.\n\n291\n00:14:18.937 --> 00:14:21.731\nWe have to think about the fact\nthat because we now opened,\n\n292\n00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:23.510\nin the cloud environment, anyway.\n\n293\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.432\nThis opportunity for us to use this\ninfrastructure, managed by a third party,\n\n294\n00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:30.866\na cloud or internet service provider.\n\n295\n00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:33.323\nWe've opened up an opportunity,\nas a defender, for\n\n296\n00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:35.734\nus to be able to go to that provider,\nand say, look.\n\n297\n00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:39.292\nUnder the proper law, with let's say,\na discovery order, or court order,\n\n298\n00:14:39.292 --> 00:14:39.962\nor whatever.\n\n299\n00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:43.648\nWe think there's evidence of something,\nwe need access to this information.\n\n300\n00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:45.893\nBut there's a negative, a downside here,\n\n301\n00:14:45.893 --> 00:14:48.396\nthat cloud provider may\nchoose to comply or not.\n\n302\n00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:51.723\nDepending on the legality and\nthe rules, and the statutory and\n\n303\n00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:54.500\nregulatory issues associated\nwith jurisdiction.\n\n304\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.070\nWhere that cloud provider is versus\nwhere you are, in other words,\n\n305\n00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.120\nbecomes the central focal point.\n\n306\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.702\nBecause the laws of the land for the\ninvestigator in country A do not apply to\n\n307\n00:15:04.702 --> 00:15:07.780\nthe cloud provider in country C,\nnecessarily.\n\n308\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.518\nThey may, they may not,\nright, but the point is,\n\n309\n00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:11.674\nyou may be operating with a very\ndifferent set of assumptions.\n\n310\n00:15:11.674 --> 00:15:15.418\nAnd a search order, or\neven a discovery order from country A,\n\n311\n00:15:15.418 --> 00:15:17.366\nmay hold no weight in country C.\n\n312\n00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:19.589\nWhere that data center is,\nand the cloud images are.\n\n313\n00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:24.712\nAnd if the hacker, the bad actor, right,\nthe anti-forensics actor is smart?\n\n314\n00:15:24.712 --> 00:15:26.807\nThey may be operating out of systems and\n\n315\n00:15:26.807 --> 00:15:30.503\nenvironments in geographies where\nthose laws will be hard to apply.\n\n316\n00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:34.333\nAnd as a result of that, it may be\nvery difficult for us to go out and\n\n317\n00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.529\nget that evidence.\n\n318\n00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:38.490\nBecause the cloud provider may have\nno interest in dealing with us.\n\n319\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:42.313\nBecause we're not going through a proper\nlegal authority, from their perspective.\n\n320\n00:15:42.313 --> 00:15:46.154\nFrom their statutory, and\ntherefore jurisdictional thought process.\n\n321\n00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.925\nSo it becomes very interwoven,\nvery complicated, very complex.\n\n322\n00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:51.070\nGone are the days where\nyou go down the street,\n\n323\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.780\nknock on the door of the data center.\n\n324\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.395\nAnd say hey, we're here, and\nthere's five law enforcement officers, and\n\n325\n00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:57.680\nhere's a search warrant.\n\n326\n00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.153\nAnd you go walk in, and\nfind the stuff you need.\n\n327\n00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:02.437\nIt's very unlikely that's\nthe case these days.\n\n328\n00:16:02.437 --> 00:16:04.800\nThis is the real world that\nwe're living in today.\n\n329\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.790\nThis is just spread out.\n\n330\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.700\nI mean, I'm waiting literally\nfast forward 10, 15 years.\n\n331\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.880\nI'm waiting until ultimately 20,\nwho knows.\n\n332\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.455\nBut, I'm waiting until we ultimately\nare able to not only set these systems up\n\n333\n00:16:15.455 --> 00:16:19.138\nas we already do globally, but think\nabout the implications, and Microsoft and\n\n334\n00:16:19.138 --> 00:16:21.414\nsome of the other vendors\nare already doing this,\n\n335\n00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:23.663\nthey're putting data\ncenters out in the ocean.\n\n336\n00:16:23.663 --> 00:16:29.228\nThey're putting data centers in open areas\nthat don't necessarily have governants and\n\n337\n00:16:29.228 --> 00:16:32.650\noversight based on,\nlet's say one country's laws.\n\n338\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.480\nOut beyond the 12 mile exclusionary\nboundary, for instance.\n\n339\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.920\nInternationally recognized by\nmost countries in the world.\n\n340\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.254\nThat area in the sea in theory,\ndepending on who'd believe in,\n\n341\n00:16:42.254 --> 00:16:45.114\nwho's law you follow or\nwhat regime you subscribe to.\n\n342\n00:16:45.114 --> 00:16:47.870\nWe're not talking about exclusion or\neconomic zones, but\n\n343\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.451\nwe are talking about the jurisdictional\nzone for the application of the law,\n\n344\n00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:54.940\nout being on the 12 mile boundary,\nthat is essentially open territory.\n\n345\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.660\nSo, you put these data centers out there\non floating platforms, in submersibles or\n\n346\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.220\nwherever, out being on\nthe 12 mile territory limit,\n\n347\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.560\nthey may not be subject to the same laws,\nand\n\n348\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.100\nwe don't have international\nregimes right now to cover that.\n\n349\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.070\nWhat about if we start\nhosting them in space?\n\n350\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.980\n&gt;&gt; They actually have that with the,\nwhat was it, the sealand.\n\n351\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.830\nThe guy that had bought the old turret or\nthe gun platform out in the ocean\n\n352\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.251\nin off Great Britain, and\ncreated his own common wealth of Sealand.\n\n353\n00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.064\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, and\nwe have servers in it.\n\n354\n00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:27.992\n&gt;&gt; They built them for World War II\nto actually float them over for\n\n355\n00:17:27.992 --> 00:17:30.090\nthe Normandy landings and stuff like that.\n\n356\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.328\n&gt;&gt; He was actually doing that, yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:31.328 --> 00:17:34.945\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's also, there's been\na couple of the radio stations that\n\n358\n00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:39.110\nare broadcasting off the ships out in\ninternational waters, and stuff like that.\n\n359\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.135\nSome of these abandoned oil rigs that are\nsitting out there that people take over.\n\n360\n00:17:42.135 --> 00:17:45.769\nThere's all this stuff that goes on,\nwe just don't really think about this, but\n\n361\n00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:48.465\nthis is the kind of crazy stuff\nthat can come up down the road.\n\n362\n00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:49.947\nLike I was suggesting just a moment ago,\n\n363\n00:17:49.947 --> 00:17:52.836\nlet's fast forward as I said into when\nthey start hosting this stuff in space.\n\n364\n00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:53.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n365\n00:17:53.348 --> 00:17:54.439\nWe'll be are able to create eventually.\n\n366\n00:17:54.439 --> 00:17:55.126\n&gt;&gt; Who owns that?\n\n367\n00:17:55.126 --> 00:17:57.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the thing, right?\n\n368\n00:17:57.092 --> 00:18:00.612\nWe could set treaties up in\nthe same theory and say, okay,\n\n369\n00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:04.507\nthis area over this country, if it's a\ngeo-synchronous orbit, is now owned by us,\n\n370\n00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:08.362\ncuz we're extending our exclusionary zone\nall the way up, and we own the satellite.\n\n371\n00:18:08.362 --> 00:18:11.222\nBut okay so, Germany owns the satellite,\n\n372\n00:18:11.222 --> 00:18:13.772\nyou're gonna go after Germany to\nget the information, they may or\n\n373\n00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:16.002\nmay not wanna play with you,\nright, I mean, that's the thing.\n\n374\n00:18:16.002 --> 00:18:18.960\nWhat about when we host on the moon,\nwhat about building data centers there?\n\n375\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.530\nWho lays claim to that, right?\n\n376\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.604\nThis is the kinda crazy stuff that in the\nfuture at some point will be things that\n\n377\n00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:24.454\nwe have to consider.\n\n378\n00:18:24.454 --> 00:18:27.365\n[LAUGH] I'm not suggesting it's important\nnow, I'm not saying it's important for\n\n379\n00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:28.368\nus to consider now.\n\n380\n00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:31.290\nI'm just theorizing that there's\na lot to these conversation\n\n381\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.160\nthat take place in the moment, but there's\na lot that we have to start thinking about\n\n382\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.210\nthat happened out beyond of that boundary.\n\n383\n00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.290\nWhat are some of\nthe anti-forensics techniques?\n\n384\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.020\nIf you wanna take a look here, and\njoin me here for just a minute,\n\n385\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.570\nwe could see there's a list of them there.\n\n386\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.030\nIf we go full screen for just a minute.\n\n387\n00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.710\nJust so we center that off,\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n388\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.240\nSo you'll see here we have a list of,\nagain not authoritative,\n\n389\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.090\nby the, well I shouldn't say not\nauthoritative, definitely authoritative.\n\n390\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.680\nWhat I mean is, not comprehensive, in the\nsense that there may be more mechanisms,\n\n391\n00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.190\nmore techniques that will be on this list.\n\n392\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.830\nBut this is a pretty standard list\nof anti-forensics techniques today.\n\n393\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.650\nData and/or file deletion,\npassword protection,\n\n394\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.320\nmeaning password-protecting files.\n\n395\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.526\nForcing you to have to have to as\nthe investigator crack passwords,\n\n396\n00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:15.732\nwe'll show you how to do that as part\nof the hands on conversation and\n\n397\n00:19:15.732 --> 00:19:17.886\ndemo we have later on\naround this knowledge.\n\n398\n00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:21.369\nSteganography, hiding stuff inside of\nother stuff, we'll take a look at that and\n\n399\n00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:21.974\nhow it works.\n\n400\n00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:25.037\nI'll show you how to create\na steganographically modified file,\n\n401\n00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:28.400\nwe'll show you how to detect\nsteganography, really cool stuff.\n\n402\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.570\nData hiding inside of slack space,\nwhite space, file system structures,\n\n403\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.240\nall sorts of things there.\n\n404\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.525\nTrail obfuscation, we mentioned this\nalready, hiding what we are doing through\n\n405\n00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:41.505\nanonymizers, proxies, and NATing,\nall sorts of ways of doing that.\n\n406\n00:19:41.505 --> 00:19:45.179\nArtifact wiping, fancy terminology for\njust deletion of data,\n\n407\n00:19:45.179 --> 00:19:48.331\nand trace data that would be\nconsidered to be valuable.\n\n408\n00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:52.587\nMetadata would fall into potentially this\ncategory as well, if you think about that,\n\n409\n00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:54.910\nso overriding data and or metadata.\n\n410\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.530\nEncryption, can't say enough\ngood things about encryption.\n\n411\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.617\nWe talk about the defensive side,\ncertainly as an investigator, right?\n\n412\n00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:05.445\nWe have to think about the fact that if a\nbad actor's encrypting their data to hide\n\n413\n00:20:05.445 --> 00:20:07.416\nwhat they're doing, makes it harder for\n\n414\n00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:10.520\nus to decrypt it unless we have\nknowledge of how to do that.\n\n415\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.030\nThat tool cuts both ways,\nthat defensive mechanism cuts both ways.\n\n416\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.350\nWe have to think about that.\n\n417\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.620\nUse of encrypted network protocols,\ntunneling, VPN, things like that.\n\n418\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.960\nSo, the use of TLS, right,\nTransport Layer Security,\n\n419\n00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.570\nthe use of L2TP with IPsec, the use\nof any of these encrypted protocols,\n\n420\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.750\nSSTP, security socket tunneling protocol.\n\n421\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.561\nWhatever it may be, if we're encrypting\nthat data, we have to think about the fact\n\n422\n00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:36.710\nthat obviously, it's harder for\nthe investigator to snoop,\n\n423\n00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.850\nto find evidence of in the network\nforensics conversation.\n\n424\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.380\nWe would have information\nthat would trace and\n\n425\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.829\ntrack packets, log entries can be\nencrypted, all sorts of stuff may go on.\n\n426\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.320\nA program of packers, right,\nwe're packing up and hiding and\n\n427\n00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.670\nobfuscating our programs, our files, our\nexecutables, so that way, it's harder for\n\n428\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.140\npeople to understand what they are.\n\n429\n00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.979\nWe may encapsulate them, and\nrun them inside of other stuff,\n\n430\n00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:03.704\nthings like Trojan horses for instance and\nTrojan programs we often hear about.\n\n431\n00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:07.356\nWe'll talk about those more on the malware\nforensics conversations that'll be\n\n432\n00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:07.925\ncoming up.\n\n433\n00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:09.892\nRootkits,right, we've\ntalked a lot about this.\n\n434\n00:21:09.892 --> 00:21:14.590\nThe use of rootkits will allow us to\nburrow into the operating system.\n\n435\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.470\nWe have rootkits for the virtual world,\nrootkits for the physical world.\n\n436\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.130\nWe've got rootkits for everything.\n\n437\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.104\nAnd if we get in, and\ntry to use rootkits, so Dan,\n\n438\n00:21:21.104 --> 00:21:24.498\nI know these are an extra special favorite\nof yours, some of the stuff you do, right?\n\n439\n00:21:24.498 --> 00:21:25.218\n&gt;&gt; They're fun.\n\n440\n00:21:25.218 --> 00:21:28.428\nSo you know the kind of destructive\npotential you have with rootkits.\n\n441\n00:21:28.428 --> 00:21:31.461\nWe could take over a system and\ndo just about anything we want, right?\n\n442\n00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n443\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.210\nA lot of potential there.\n\n444\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.451\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then it just makes it so\ndifficult for\n\n445\n00:21:35.451 --> 00:21:39.389\nthe administrators out there to go, when\ndid we get this rootkit, we don't know.\n\n446\n00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:42.435\nIt could have been sitting in\nthe system for some time, so\n\n447\n00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.727\nour back ups might not\neven be worth using.\n\n448\n00:21:44.727 --> 00:21:48.868\nAnd we'll have to rebuild from scratch and\njust have to try to piecemeal these\n\n449\n00:21:48.868 --> 00:21:52.600\nthings together can be really\ndevastating to an organization.\n\n450\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.610\n&gt;&gt; It can be, and\nyou raise an excellent point,\n\n451\n00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.990\nwhich is we don't necessarily\nknow at the point of inflection,\n\n452\n00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.380\nwhere we were infected was and the vector,\nthe approach that may have been used.\n\n453\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.750\nMay have been an insider threat, so\neven if we are able to restore the data,\n\n454\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.221\nthe person that did it may\njust put it right back again.\n\n455\n00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:09.470\nAnd so this gets into a lot\nof other concerns we have.\n\n456\n00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.510\nWe may have to really be looking at\nthe process, and the procedure, and\n\n457\n00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.660\nthe policy we use to manage, and\nset up data in the first place.\n\n458\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.240\nAre we using a two person rule?\n\n459\n00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.340\nSo we always have that verification\nvalidation that somebody's not up to no\n\n460\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.800\ngood without our knowledge.\n\n461\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.540\nAre we using separation of duties, right?\n\n462\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.940\nThe idea of being able to say, hey,\n\n463\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.770\nif Daniel's our administrator that's in\ncharge of backups, then he shouldn't also\n\n464\n00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.000\nbe the administrator that's\nin charge of restoring data.\n\n465\n00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.616\nBecause if he's the bad actor, could\nliterally just manipulate the data when he\n\n466\n00:22:34.616 --> 00:22:38.354\nrestores it, reproducing and putting back\nin the rootkit without our knowledge.\n\n467\n00:22:38.354 --> 00:22:41.154\nAnd it would be this vicious cycle\nthat we may never, at least easily,\n\n468\n00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:44.335\nbe able to recover from, and eventually\nwe'd probably, we may it figure out,\n\n469\n00:22:44.335 --> 00:22:44.970\nbut who knows.\n\n470\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.040\nMaybe Daniel's really good\nat covering his tracks, and\n\n471\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.550\nmaybe we don't find out, right,\nit would be hard to say.\n\n472\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.080\nSo we have to think about\nthese commonalities, but\n\n473\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.735\nthese very basic elementary kinda security\n101 methodologies we often talk about,\n\n474\n00:22:56.735 --> 00:22:58.790\nbecause they have to\ncome back into play here.\n\n475\n00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.870\nRemember as a forensic investigator,\nit's not just our job to tell a compelling\n\n476\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.540\nstory, but it's our job to point\nout glaring errors of omission.\n\n477\n00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.560\nThat the company, the entity,\nwhoever it is, whatever it was, may or\n\n478\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.926\nmay not have engaged in, that facilitated\nthat allowed these events to occur.\n\n479\n00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:18.470\nWe're looking for a root cause,\nand we've got to be without fear,\n\n480\n00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.500\nwithout concern of hurting\npeople's feelings.\n\n481\n00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.840\nWithout the ability to\nbe able to speak and\n\n482\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.960\noperate freely,\nwe really can't do our job.\n\n483\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.340\nWe have to be willing to and\nable to tell those stories, and\n\n484\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.350\npoint out those things when we find\nthem that are not supposed to be done or\n\n485\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.850\nthings that we know better but\nare being done anyway.\n\n486\n00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.290\nWe need to minimize our footprint.\n\n487\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.880\nWe kind of go back to our list here.\n\n488\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.600\nRight, remember again,\n\n489\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.240\nas the bad actor we wanna have as little\nexposure as possible here, right?\n\n490\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.950\nSo we're gonna try to run our systems and\n\n491\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.140\nour tools in a way that\nreally runs under the radar.\n\n492\n00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.860\nExploit forensics tools bugs, right?\n\n493\n00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.095\nThis is one of the things\na lot of people do.\n\n494\n00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:55.382\nJust like in the real world, where we\nhave bugs and patches applied, and\n\n495\n00:23:55.382 --> 00:23:57.360\noperating systems and everything else.\n\n496\n00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.490\nForensic stools are pieces of software\nlike everything else in the world.\n\n497\n00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.587\nThey're made up of code,\npeople write them.\n\n498\n00:24:02.587 --> 00:24:04.752\nSome code is good,\nsome code is not so good,\n\n499\n00:24:04.752 --> 00:24:08.460\nsometimes we pay attention to detail,\nother times we make mistakes.\n\n500\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.180\nSo we're looking at the journals,\nwe're looking at the vendor sites,\n\n501\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.300\nwe're looking at the blogs and\nthe communities around these tools.\n\n502\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.890\nWe being the bad actors and\n\n503\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.660\nwe're doing the same things that\nyou as the good actors are doing.\n\n504\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.480\nWe're paying attention.\n\n505\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.990\nN case has this issue,\napply this patch to fix this problem.\n\n506\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.650\nWell hey,\nI'm going go to go exploit that and\n\n507\n00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.620\nI'm going to try to figure out a way\nto figure out evidence that's going\n\n508\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.330\nto hide in that crack between the bug and\nthe patch.\n\n509\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.570\nAnd maybe not everybody is\ngoing to have it applied right.\n\n510\n00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.610\nBecause not everybody we\nknow keeps up with that.\n\n511\n00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.790\nSo these are the kind of things\nyou want to think about.\n\n512\n00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.368\nAlso detecting forensic tool activities.\n\n513\n00:24:42.368 --> 00:24:45.200\nWe're going to be able to\nlook as a bad actor in theory\n\n514\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.700\nwant to be looking at evidence\nof the use of these tools.\n\n515\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.470\nWe will run these tools, trying to figure\nout again, we being the bad actor.\n\n516\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.480\nWe will run these tools trying\nto figure out how they work and\n\n517\n00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.030\nwhat the tell-tale signs are.\n\n518\n00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.580\nLook, there's a text file, look, there's\nthis DLL, look, there's this directory.\n\n519\n00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.800\nAnd if we see that evidence on a machine,\nwe may stay away from that machine,\n\n520\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.040\nknowing that it's probably\nbeing monitored, right?\n\n521\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.770\nOr, we may hide our information in such a\nway that it doesn't show up easily inside\n\n522\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.920\nof those tools, knowing what they do and\nhow they work, so, again, we have to think\n\n523\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.930\nabout this and just be aware of the fact\nthat there's a lot of gray area, right?\n\n524\n00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.640\nThat the anti-forensics people that are\noperating out there may be able to operate\n\n525\n00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.300\nwithin, and\nmay be able to take advantage of.\n\n526\n00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.690\nSo, we do have to think about that,\n\n527\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.370\nand probably in our minds\nbegin to form this picture.\n\n528\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.370\nBecause this is again,\n\n529\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.630\nthis idea of the, I refer to it\nsometimes as a split personality, right?\n\n530\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.540\nThe Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde of security.\n\n531\n00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.550\nWe have to sit on both sides of\nthat divide as an investigator,\n\n532\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.620\nbecause if we can't think\nlike the bad actor.\n\n533\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.350\nWe really are missing the opportunity\nto understand what things we should be\n\n534\n00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.540\nlooking for, and as the actor clearly\nright to the other side, we can't think\n\n535\n00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.140\nlike the defender we're missing\nthe opportunity to understand our best way\n\n536\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.220\nprobably to move around those defenses and\npotentially gain points of entry.\n\n537\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.630\nWe have to be able to sit on either side\nof this divide and we can't be scared\n\n538\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.760\nto think like the bad actor, we're not\ngoing to become the bad actor, but we have\n\n539\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.340\nto open up our mindset to the idea that\nit's okay to understand these nuances and\n\n540\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.010\nuse these tools in a way that allows us to\nexamine what they do in order to better\n\n541\n00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.970\nthen use that knowledge, in this case,\nto be able to defend to our betterment,\n\n542\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.170\nultimately to allow us to\nbe better at our jobs.\n\n543\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.160\nVery important thought process.\n\n544\n00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you think of it like a burglar.\n\n545\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.140\nWho knows.\n\n546\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.080\nThat model lock right there is completely\nworthless because I can pick it with\n\n547\n00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.940\na bobby pin and it's very easy for\nsomeone to learn how to do that.\n\n548\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.480\nAnd you think in that way,\n\n549\n00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.690\nwell I'm not going to be a burglar,\nI'm not going to exploit that lock.\n\n550\n00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.420\nI'm going to tell that owner of the home,\n\n551\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.670\nprobably a good idea to change those locks\nup for something a little more secure,\n\n552\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.750\nbecause that's a super weak\nspot in your defenses.\n\n553\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.150\nSo, that's the kind of idea,\n\n554\n00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.520\nthat's the kind of mindset that\nwe're trying to come at this from,\n\n555\n00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.510\nwas why you have to stand on both sides\nof the field and get those perspectives.\n\n556\n00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.270\nSo we can find those weak spots and\nmitigate those problems.\n\n557\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.300\nAdam, I know we have a lot more to go,\nbut you know what?\n\n558\n00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.550\nWe're out of time in this episode and\nwe'll look at more ways in which\n\n559\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.500\nThe bad actors might troll us,\n[LAUGH] as a forensics investigator.\n\n560\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.550\nSo join us back for part two.\n\n561\n00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.920\nAs for this one, it is time for\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n562\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.920\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n563\n00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.880\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n564\n00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.834\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:27:20.834 -->

00:00:11.941\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:13.897\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:16.500\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.160\nit is more on our CHFI version 9 series,\nof course.\n\n8\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.770\nLike a day without sunshine,\nit would be a day without Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.100\nAdam Gordon joining us back in the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.444\nAdam, we're glad to have you again,\nand how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:30.462\n&gt;&gt; We've had a few of those,\nrecently, right?\n\n12\n00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:31.921\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we have, [LAUGH] completely.\n\n13\n00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.900\n&gt;&gt; I've been here for them, though,\nso it wasn't because I wasn't around.\n\n14\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.810\nAll right, so, we're gonna continue our\nconversations with regards to starting to\n\n15\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.950\ndelve into more of the intricacies and\nthe mysteries around anti-forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.945\nLay down some of the thought\nprocesses in foundational elements,\n\n17\n00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.030\nof what the goals of anti-forensics are,\nand\n\n18\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.930\nsome of the approaches overall at\na high level we would see used.\n\n19\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.100\nIn our last episode,\n\n20\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.210\nencourage you to go take a look at\nthat if you haven't seen it, but\n\n21\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.802\nI thought we would start off by talking\nabout what happens when files are deleted.\n\n22\n00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:02.390\nThis is a pretty common thought process,\none of the most basic elementary, yet\n\n23\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.320\nmost potentially effective ways,\n\n24\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.700\nat least to the average individual that\ndoesn't know better, of hiding data.\n\n25\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.640\nThe average attacker would think they\ndon't understand what we do for a living,\n\n26\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.310\nthat if I delete the file, it's gone and I\nwon't have to worry about it coming back.\n\n27\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.408\nBut of course, we know better.\n\n28\n00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:20.200\nSo if you join me over here, I thought\na little practical hands on demonstration\n\n29\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.295\nfor a second would be in order.\n\n30\n00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.760\nSo Dan, you're gonna help me out with\nthis, if you don't mind, for a moment.\n\n31\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.045\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem.\n&gt;&gt; My hands will never leave my\n\n32\n00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.730\nbody during this demonstration,\nby the way.\n\n33\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.520\nAt all times,\nthey will always be connected,\n\n34\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.100\neven though you may not be able to\nsee them cuz they're below the frame.\n\n35\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.391\nActually, I just took them off\nright now and put them inside the-\n\n36\n00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:33.921\n&gt;&gt; Your little cubby hole here.\n\n37\n00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.658\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I put Daniel's hands on instead.\n\n38\n00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:40.080\nI know you're not a big,\nyou watch Futurama.\n\n39\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.515\nI think we talked about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I watch Futurama, yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:45.420\n&gt;&gt; You ever see the episode where Fry\nhas to trade hands with the robot devil?\n\n41\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.716\n&gt;&gt; No, I haven't seen that one.\n\n42\n00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:47.256\n&gt;&gt; That's a great episode.\n\n43\n00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:48.201\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good one.\n[LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.138\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Fry plays that crazy harmoniphone\n\n45\n00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.680\nor whatever it is, the bubble thing.\n\n46\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.262\nAnd he's like, I wanna impress Leela and\nI wanna make a song for her.\n\n47\n00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.058\nAnd he's so horrible at it, and they cut a\ndeal, and essentially, the robot devil and\n\n48\n00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:00.790\nFry exchange hands.\n\n49\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.523\nSo the robot devil comes out with this\nlike meat cleaver, and he's like Benihana-\n\n50\n00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:06.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.874\n&gt;&gt; Technician, he chops the hands off,\n\n52\n00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:08.789\nthey switch them, and\n\n53\n00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.130\nthen the whole episode's about how the\nrobot devil schemes to get his hands back.\n\n54\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.760\nHis hands are plugged in.\n\n55\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.308\nSo now Fry is walking\naround with the claws.\n\n56\n00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:17.579\nAnd the robot devil's got Fry's hands,\nandFry's hands are touching him everywhere\n\n57\n00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.998\nand he's like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:20.290\n&gt;&gt; I can't stand this, stop touching me.\n\n59\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, we digress.\n\n60\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.790\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good episode.\n\n61\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.910\n&gt;&gt; It is actually a really fun episode.\n\n62\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.500\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n63\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.990\nSo [LAUGH] let's take a look over here,\nif you could please.\n\n64\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.398\nSo I thought we would just talk about\nhow files get deleted in Windows.\n\n65\n00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:35.148\nNow I've got two files just sitting over\nhere, let me just drag them over into\n\n66\n00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:38.960\nthe light as it were, so we can see\nthem just a little bit better, right?\n\n67\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.506\nSo, it doesn't matter what they are,\nthe files themselves are irrelevant.\n\n68\n00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:45.326\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna delete\none file, so I'm just gonna drag this, and\n\n69\n00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:48.960\nin traditional style and thought process,\nthrow it in the recycle bin, right?\n\n70\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.970\nJust boom, it's gone, now,\nwe know it's not gone.\n\n71\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.982\nWe know it's sitting in the recycle bin,\nbut my point is,\n\n72\n00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:55.650\nit's no longer in the desktop.\n\n73\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.916\nAlthough it certainly is in\nan area where we could recover it,\n\n74\n00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.590\nI'm sure we all are aware of that.\n\n75\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.180\nAnd what we can do and what we normally\nwill do if we know we wanna try to get rid\n\n76\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.930\nof a file is take a file like\nthis text file I have there.\n\n77\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.822\nAnd instead of doing what I just did, hit\nthe Shift key along with Delete, right?\n\n78\n00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:15.670\nAnd you could then delete\nthe file by actually going in and\n\n79\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.010\nbypassing, right, the recycle bin.\n\n80\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.780\nAnd if we delete it, right,\nwhile holding down the Shift key,\n\n81\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.477\nthat file would actually disappear,\nwhat is the keystroke for delete in the,\n\n82\n00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.991\ndid we establish what the keystroke was?\n\n83\n00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:30.817\n&gt;&gt; In Mac?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for\n\n84\n00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.108\nit to pass that thing through?\n\n85\n00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:34.554\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just move to trash.\n\n86\n00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:39.437\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK] no, I'll just do it\n\n87\n00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:44.470\nthis way, I'll hold down the Shift key and\nright-click.\n\n88\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.905\nWe're having that whole passage-\n&gt;&gt; I think it might be Alt-\n\n89\n00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Alt-Delete is what it is,\n\n90\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.950\ndelete is backspace.\n\n91\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not really Delete.\n\n92\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.713\nAnyway, this is just that little bit\n\n93\n00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:52.440\nreally-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.603\n&gt;&gt; That we have going on because where\n\n95\n00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:54.670\nwe're hosting the VM.\n\n96\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.780\nSo you'll see I'm gonna just delete and\nhold down the Shift key, right?\n\n97\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.528\nAnd boom, it's gone.\n\n98\n00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:02.620\nIt did not go to the recycle bin, it just\nbypasses, right, and goes directly off.\n\n99\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.000\nNow we know,\nat least hopefully you know, but\n\n100\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.150\nwhen we've done this, the file is\nactually still sitting on the hard drive.\n\n101\n00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.050\nIt's just that the reference pointer that\nallows us to see it in the graphical\n\n102\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.537\ninterface, on the desktop or\nwherever it may be, has been removed.\n\n103\n00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:21.188\nSo that essentially, the referenceable\nmetadata information, the linking, and\n\n104\n00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:25.000\nall the stuff we do to show the file,\nhas simply just been truncated.\n\n105\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.380\nIt's been removed, or deleted, or\nis now no longer being referenced.\n\n106\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.543\nBut the data itself, the bits,\nthe bites, all that,\n\n107\n00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:31.965\nis still sitting on the hard drive.\n\n108\n00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:34.669\nAnd if we know that we can go back and\nrecover, which we do,\n\n109\n00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.875\nas a forensic investigator,\nwe've shown you mechanisms already,\n\n110\n00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.657\ntools already in prior episodes and prior\ndemos, that would allow us to do that.\n\n111\n00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:45.367\nRemember in the data acquisition\nduplication episodes,\n\n112\n00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:49.300\nwhere I did the hands on walk through,\nwe used the access FDK or\n\n113\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.461\nthe FDK disk editor to be able to\ngo in and actually recover a file,\n\n114\n00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:57.745\npull the PDF right out of the disk image,\nthrow it on the desktop.\n\n115\n00:04:57.745 --> 00:05:00.025\nWe're able to see that we can\nrecover a file with no trouble.\n\n116\n00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:02.735\nSo finding data that's been\ndeleted is not a problem,\n\n117\n00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.845\nthose were actually deleted files that we\nlooked at, and I recovered one of them.\n\n118\n00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:08.675\nSo nothing truly disappears,\nthis is the mantra and\n\n119\n00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.350\nthe mindset of the investigator.\n\n120\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.930\nAre there ways to permanently\nget rid of that data?\n\n121\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.310\nYes, in theory,\nwe would have to take additional steps.\n\n122\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.500\nWe could low level format the drive,\n\n123\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.620\nwe've talked about data sanitization\nin previous episodes as well.\n\n124\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.370\nThe NIST standards for data sanitization,\nright, clearing, purging, deleting or\n\n125\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.762\ndestroying, as we talked about,\nwould fall into these categories.\n\n126\n00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:34.070\nNIST SP 888 R1 would be\nthe document we reference there.\n\n127\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.830\nSo remember, we just updated, but\nwe may not be able to see the data, but\n\n128\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.540\nthat doesn't mean that it's\nactually been destroyed.\n\n129\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.757\nAnd we have to keep that in mind,\nbecause the average bad actor may or\n\n130\n00:05:41.757 --> 00:05:42.836\nmay not realize that.\n\n131\n00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:46.138\nThey may just take the surface steps and\nsay, okay, yeah, I've deleted it,\n\n132\n00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:46.710\nit's gone.\n\n133\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.146\nIf I delete a file in Linux,\nI can do the same thing,\n\n134\n00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:50.753\nhold down the Shift key, right?\n\n135\n00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:52.860\nI can bypass the deletion container.\n\n136\n00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.525\nSame thing on the Mac, I can bypass the\ntrash or whatever we're gonna call it, but\n\n137\n00:05:56.525 --> 00:06:00.405\nI am still leaving the data remnant\non the drive and remnant data, right?\n\n138\n00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:03.505\nData that is residual is our\nfriend as an investigator.\n\n139\n00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:06.375\nIt's our enemy if we\nare practicing anti-forensics.\n\n140\n00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:09.352\nSo keep that in mind, but\nin the fat file system, right,\n\n141\n00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:12.832\nthe OS will actually replace\nthe first letter of the deleted file\n\n142\n00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:16.512\nwith a hex byte code that represents\nthat the file has been deleted.\n\n143\n00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:19.798\nCapital E5, lowercase h,\nE5h, will be that byte code,\n\n144\n00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:23.108\nspecial tag that indicates that\nthe file has been deleted.\n\n145\n00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:26.525\nSo that when we look at the system data,\nwe look at the allocation table,\n\n146\n00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:29.454\nwe see E5h, we say okay,\nthat's deleted, don't show it.\n\n147\n00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:33.744\nBut the data’s still there, we reference\nit, so if we know that and we look for\n\n148\n00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:37.715\nE5h codes as we do a search on\nthe hard drive, we find deleted files.\n\n149\n00:06:37.715 --> 00:06:40.170\nThat's in FAT of course, and\nthat’s what we do there.\n\n150\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.105\nIn the NTFS file system in the partitions,\n\n151\n00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.685\nwhen the user deletes the file, we do mark\nit as deleted in the master file table.\n\n152\n00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:52.256\nWe took a look at this file,\nif you remember.\n\n153\n00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:55.959\n$nft, $nft mirror, two of the files\nwe highlighted, discussed,\n\n154\n00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:00.165\nshowed you with various tools in prior\nepisodes, about how to interact with and\n\n155\n00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:03.780\nhow to examine as part of the data\ngrab and the acquisition, right?\n\n156\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.413\nThe clusters allocated to deleted\nfiles are marked as free and\n\n157\n00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:07.687\nthe dollar sign bitmap file.\n\n158\n00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:10.440\nSo we talked about that file as well.\n\n159\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.460\nRight, that's a record of all the used and\nthe unused clusters.\n\n160\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.080\nThat's why we wanna look\nat the bitmap file again.\n\n161\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.920\nWe took a look at that with the FDK tool.\n\n162\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.680\nIf you remember, we went in, or\nthe TSK tool, the sleuth toolkit,\n\n163\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.910\nrather, we took a look\nat that with i-stat.\n\n164\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.385\nAnd we looked at i-stat or\nused i-stat to look at all and\n\n165\n00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:27.972\nwalk through all these NTFS files.\n\n166\n00:07:27.972 --> 00:07:28.827\nFun times, right?\n\n167\n00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:30.986\nGood episode, right,\nwe should go back and do that again.\n\n168\n00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:32.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just for kicks.\n\n169\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Just for the [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just for giggles, right?\n\n170\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.090\nSo now we see those as empty clusters\nin NTFS, and we can start reusing them.\n\n171\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.400\nBut remember,\nbecause of the massive amount of space,\n\n172\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.050\npotentially, in most hard\ndrives that's available,\n\n173\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.880\nwe may not get back to writing over\nthose clusters for a long time.\n\n174\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.050\nAnd as a result, that data will\nprobably stay remnant there.\n\n175\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.116\nAnd we can find it because if it's\nnot allocated to another file,\n\n176\n00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:55.574\nthat data will be sitting essentially\nin that, quote unquote, empty and\n\n177\n00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:59.200\navailable space, waiting to either be\noverwritten or waiting to be picked up\n\n178\n00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.767\nwhen we go back and work through the logic\nof looking at these files to find.\n\n179\n00:08:02.767 --> 00:08:03.542\nThis information.\n\n180\n00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:04.885\nSo do keep that in mind,\n\n181\n00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:09.208\nwe did talk about using the Shift+Delete\noption to bypass the Recycle Bin.\n\n182\n00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.610\nBut remember that does not\nremove the file permanently.\n\n183\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.691\nIt just removes the file from our\nability to see it most likely and\n\n184\n00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:16.304\nrecover it in that second stage.\n\n185\n00:08:16.304 --> 00:08:21.100\nOr additional holding area known as the\nTrash, Recycle Bin, whatever it may be.\n\n186\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.874\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n187\n00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:26.593\nBut where we keep those files in\nthe recycle bin if the user was just doing\n\n188\n00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:28.000\na surface delete.\n\n189\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.890\nEssentially just deleting it but\n\n190\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.380\nleaving it there,\nright even if they empty the recycle bin.\n\n191\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.073\nI showed you that with Data Explorer tools\nlike the NTFS disc explorer that we used.\n\n192\n00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:38.480\nI could see the recycle bin.\n\n193\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.889\nWe actually went through the logic,\n\n194\n00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:42.487\nread the GUID and say look,\nthat's the administrator account.\n\n195\n00:08:42.487 --> 00:08:46.119\nWe would see a recycle bin\nwith a unique identifier for\n\n196\n00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:48.550\nevery user sitting in that system.\n\n197\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.920\nWe would be able to go in and\nwe would be able to find that.\n\n198\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.058\nSo we just wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n199\n00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:58.287\nAnd that we know that we actually can\ntrack back by looking at the partitin,\n\n200\n00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.789\nimaging the system.\n\n201\n00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.450\nThis is again where we go back\nto a basic tool like IDD.\n\n202\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.000\nSo valuable, right?\n\n203\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.910\nOften overlooked but really one of those\nbaseline tools that every forensic\n\n204\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.860\ninvestigator should have in their\ntool kit, and should know how to use.\n\n205\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.270\nCreate that image,\nload that image up in a graphic editor.\n\n206\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.710\nAnd then either looking at the hex-code or\ngrabbing the hex, and\n\n207\n00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.940\nthen interrogating it.\n\n208\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.680\nAnd then using the tool that shows that\ninformation to us, we were able to go in\n\n209\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.690\nand see the contents of the recycle\nbin for each and every user.\n\n210\n00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.754\nSo we do wanna keep that in mind, right.\n\n211\n00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:30.598\nThere was a limit on the older versions\nof the Microsoft operating system for\n\n212\n00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:34.562\nthe size of the Recycle Bin up to Vista\nit was 3.99, essentially round up,\n\n213\n00:09:34.562 --> 00:09:35.550\nsay four gigs.\n\n214\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.270\nBut on beyond that in the newer versions,\nright, or\n\n215\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.175\nsorry from Vista on there's no limit\nin the prior versions meaning XP and\n\n216\n00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:45.565\nbefore there would have been\na limit of up to four gigs.\n\n217\n00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:47.875\nBut starting with Vista because\nVista's kind of that turning point,\n\n218\n00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:48.835\nthat cut off point.\n\n219\n00:09:48.835 --> 00:09:52.312\nSo Vista forward we don't have a limit\nto the size of files that can go into\n\n220\n00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:53.173\nthe recycle bin.\n\n221\n00:09:53.173 --> 00:09:56.705\nSo we cold recover very large files often\ntimes depending on what we're looking at.\n\n222\n00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:59.335\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n223\n00:09:59.335 --> 00:10:03.020\nAnd we wanna know that looking at the\nrecycle bin using a tool like that as we\n\n224\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.943\nshowed you it's a great way\nto think about removing data.\n\n225\n00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:09.373\nBecause again people will try to hide\nstuff by deleting it from there but\n\n226\n00:10:09.373 --> 00:10:11.900\nwe know better, we can delve in and\nfind that right?\n\n227\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.880\nSo just wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that and have a sense of that.\n\n228\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.600\nWe could go through and\ndelete a file, right?\n\n229\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.360\nAnd we could go through and remove a file\nwhen we look for evidence of that.\n\n230\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.820\nThere's actually a renumbering or\n\n231\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.280\nfile name change that takes place\nwhen we look at the recycle bin.\n\n232\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.224\nAnd we just wanna know, and if you join me\nright here I will show you what that looks\n\n233\n00:10:33.224 --> 00:10:35.487\nlike, I'll walk you\nthrough the logic of it.\n\n234\n00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:39.330\nIf we can go full screen for just a minute\nit'll be easier to see the text here.\n\n235\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.520\nSo in Vista and later we rename the files\nstored in the Recycle Bin as something\n\n236\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.663\nlike $Ry.ext, and I'll explain what\nthe R and the y are for here, right.\n\n237\n00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:49.849\nWith an extension we use\nit by using Dxy.ext,\n\n238\n00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:53.450\nessentially in the older versions,\nit depends on what we're doing.\n\n239\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.860\nToday more and more it's probably these\nnewer versions of the OS that we're using.\n\n240\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.090\nAnd so we're probably going\nto see less and less of this.\n\n241\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.330\nBut the idea is that x,\nright is gonna represent the drive name.\n\n242\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.337\nLet's say in this example here y is\nsequential number that starts from zero.\n\n243\n00:11:06.337 --> 00:11:08.710\nRemember we always start at zero, right.\n\n244\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.650\nAnd then the .ext being\nthe original file's extension.\n\n245\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.420\nThis is in other words,\n\n246\n00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.220\njust a set of placeholders that tell\nus what it would ultimately look like.\n\n247\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.160\nSo r, in the case of newer OS's,\nlike let's say Vista forward,\n\n248\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.330\nright, will be the or wait, not r, rather.\n\n249\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.819\nBut the y will be a sequential\nnumber starting from zero.\n\n250\n00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:30.560\nThe .ext will be\nthe extension of the file.\n\n251\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.921\nSo when we look at something\non an older system, right?\n\n252\n00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:35.979\nFor instance here, let's take a look.\n\n253\n00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:40.340\nSo Dh3.pdf h is the drive.\n\n254\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.725\nFourth file deleted, right?\n\n255\n00:11:41.725 --> 00:11:43.640\nThree is the fourth file.\n\n256\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.480\nAnd then a pdf file for\nthe extension right?\n\n257\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.360\nSo that would be something\nthat we would see.\n\n258\n00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.396\nSo if I did something like\nthis where I see this path,\n\n259\n00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:54.846\nthis would have been the original\nfile name ITPROTV.pdf,\n\n260\n00:11:54.846 --> 00:11:58.508\nthat I would have gone to delete,\nwe'll say hypothetically.\n\n261\n00:11:58.508 --> 00:12:02.406\nBut that's what it was in the listing in\nthe info file that tells us the manifest\n\n262\n00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:04.178\nof what's in the recycle bin info or\n\n263\n00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:07.010\ninfo2 are the file names\nof these files that we see.\n\n264\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.280\nAgain, depending on the version\nof the OS and Windows.\n\n265\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.090\nSo when I see something listed\nin a file path like that,\n\n266\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.240\nor rather in the info file.\n\n267\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.210\nThat's truly what its gonna translate\ninto, would be most likely that.\n\n268\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.840\nAnd so we'd have to read this\nkind of a file statement or\n\n269\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.020\nthis kind of a path statement to\nunderstand right what that would be.\n\n270\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.730\nIf we do this in Windows 10,\nwhat we see is a little bit different.\n\n271\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.575\nRemember it's the old school\nway of doing it in XP, prior.\n\n272\n00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:35.122\nBut we will probably don't see that\nvery often, we probably see something\n\n273\n00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:40.290\nmore like this now, saying Windows 10,\nyou see dollar sign R7 dot pdf right?\n\n274\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.550\nAnd so If we did that,\nwe would just move that over there and\n\n275\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.380\nrealize we have that\nkind of bunched up right?\n\n276\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.860\nThis is the eighth file deleted,\nseven remember, we are not\n\n277\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:56.120\nreferencing the Drive that\nwe are using now, right?\n\n278\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.690\nWe just used a common placeholder for\nthat, right?\n\n279\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.360\nSo you could see here eight\nfile deleted and a pdf file.\n\n280\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.625\nSo we would still be able to tell\nit was a certain kind of file.\n\n281\n00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:07.308\nIt was the eight file,\nlet's say in, and it was the pdf.\n\n282\n00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:10.522\nBut we have to do a little more digging\nto them to be able to work backwards and\n\n283\n00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:12.160\nthen cover exactly what it was.\n\n284\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.700\nSo we can see that if we go into\nthe Recycle Bin, read through the info,\n\n285\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.830\ninfo2 file,\nwhatever it may be that we find.\n\n286\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.350\nWe actually can find evidence of and\n\n287\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.410\nrepresentation of data that\nhas been removed, right?\n\n288\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.578\nWe also may find that the Recycle Bin\nitself may become damaged.\n\n289\n00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:29.455\nA lot of times what bad actors would do is\nthey actually try to damage the recycle\n\n290\n00:13:29.455 --> 00:13:33.180\nbin to hide evidence to the fact that\nthey dumped a bunch of stuff out there.\n\n291\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.950\nYou know its kind of like put the stuff\nin the trash right and then throw\n\n292\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.140\nthe trashcan away with the trash they wont\nfind fingerprints of me doing anything.\n\n293\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.220\nWell we can go recover their recycle bin,\nessentially the trash can and\n\n294\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.380\nfind the files inside\nif you think about it.\n\n295\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.850\nSo if the recycle bin stops working,\nit is a difficult thing to do but\n\n296\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.180\nwe could certainly recover it.\n\n297\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.790\nBut the idea is that we would\nhave to delete this info or\n\n298\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.670\ninfo two file that I talked about and re.\n\n299\n00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.980\nSpawn this and by doing that it deletes\nthe manifest file that simply controls\n\n300\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.710\nthe recycle bin and\nit respawns the recycle bin.\n\n301\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.590\nWe have to restart the machine so\nwe are gong to have to be aware of that.\n\n302\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.836\nThis is important right because if we\nare not thinking about this what we\n\n303\n00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:13.300\nhave to do is if we have to restart\nthe machine then we have to\n\n304\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.429\nknow if we don't capture volatile\ndata we're gonna lose that data.\n\n305\n00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:18.640\nBecause we're gonna have to restart it,\nright?\n\n306\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.920\nSo we gotta be thinking about the fact\nthat, if we go after the recycle bin.\n\n307\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.720\nAnd the recycle bin has been damaged and\nwe have to spawn this again.\n\n308\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.050\nAnd we have to restart in order for\nthis to work,\n\n309\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.266\nwe may have to think about\nputting this off and\n\n310\n00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:34.134\ndoing this maybe at the tail end of what\nwe're doing right before we shut down.\n\n311\n00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:36.670\nOr as we're getting ready to shut down and\ncapture an image.\n\n312\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.550\nBut keep in mind, if we do that and\nwe respawn the recycle bin we've already\n\n313\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.920\nmodified the system and we're modifying\nwhat's gonna be in that image, right.\n\n314\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.700\nSo your logic would say hey,\nlet's wait til the very end.\n\n315\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.560\nWe may have to capture this image, right,\nbefore we can deal with the recycle bin.\n\n316\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.967\nSo we have an accurate representation\nof what the system looked like,\n\n317\n00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:58.752\nalong with the fact that\nthe recycle bin had been broken.\n\n318\n00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:01.440\nMeaning it had been modified so\nit's not working the right way.\n\n319\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.180\nSo we have to think about this and\nunderstand this and\n\n320\n00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.730\nthink about how we slop\nthis into our methodology.\n\n321\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.388\nIs this data we can go after?\n\n322\n00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:09.523\nThis is gonna damage or\n\n323\n00:15:09.523 --> 00:15:13.385\nmodify something further down on\nthe chain in the order of volatility.\n\n324\n00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:14.315\nShould we do it?\n\n325\n00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:17.325\nRight before we shut off\nto capture the image, and\n\n326\n00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:19.805\nthen maybe if we do that,\ncapture the image.\n\n327\n00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:22.552\nBut then the problem promised now,\nwe've modified the recycle bin and\n\n328\n00:15:22.552 --> 00:15:24.716\ninstructed the fouls,\nthat's essentially a no-no.\n\n329\n00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:27.063\nSo we have to think about\nhave him in it first and\n\n330\n00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:31.054\nthen maybe dealing with the secondary,\nwhat we would do is capture the image.\n\n331\n00:15:31.054 --> 00:15:35.560\nAnd then make this fixed,\nachieve this change on the image, right?\n\n332\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.070\nAnd we would do this separately after\nthe fact and then see what comes up in\n\n333\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.710\nthe recycle bin in the forensically sound\nimage as opposed to on the original.\n\n334\n00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.540\nThat would be the proper way to do this.\n\n335\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.120\nSo we have to be thinking about this,\nright?\n\n336\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.020\nAnd really understand the logic of\nhow this happens and why it happens.\n\n337\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.261\nCuz if we're not thinking\nabout it the following way, or\n\n338\n00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:55.262\nrather thinking about it this way and\njust thinking through the logic of it.\n\n339\n00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:57.080\nWe actually have some concerns, right?\n\n340\n00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.483\nWe can actually wind up damaging\nour ability to use this evidence.\n\n341\n00:16:00.483 --> 00:16:01.555\nAnd that can lead to complications.\n\n342\n00:16:01.555 --> 00:16:03.592\nSo what you need to think about this and\n\n343\n00:16:03.592 --> 00:16:06.680\nthink through the logic\nof what we're gonna do.\n\n344\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.350\nDamaged files in the Recycle Bin folder\ndo not appear in the Recycle Bin.\n\n345\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.162\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nwe may not realize they're there.\n\n346\n00:16:13.162 --> 00:16:15.403\nAnd we have to use the recovery\ntool like we showed you,\n\n347\n00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:18.420\nto be able to mount the Recycle Bin,\nI showed how we could do that.\n\n348\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.994\nLook at information and we could do that,\nbut we could also restore them.\n\n349\n00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:25.170\nAnd see them in the graphical interface\nby following the instructions that I\n\n350\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.670\nhave there.\n\n351\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.706\nWe would actually be able to go back in,\n\n352\n00:16:28.706 --> 00:16:31.625\nwe have to spawn a new\ndesktop.ini file as part of that.\n\n353\n00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:35.610\nAnd the steps to do that are actually\ndown below those steps in the notes.\n\n354\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.110\nYou could see them, if you go through and\ntrack through there.\n\n355\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.120\nBut we would spawn a new desktop.ini file,\nand\n\n356\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.810\nthen based on that we can recreate\nthat along with the necessary files in\n\n357\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.780\nthe Recycle Bin by just simply following\nthe steps that I've outlined for you.\n\n358\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.413\nIt's just one of those things that\nyou probably wanna be aware of.\n\n359\n00:16:51.413 --> 00:16:54.017\nYou may have to use in the real world\nwhich is why I bothered to put it in\n\n360\n00:16:54.017 --> 00:16:55.690\nthe notes for you, just keep that in mind.\n\n361\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.160\nIn Windows 10, we can actually do\nthis a little bit differently.\n\n362\n00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.360\nIf you give me one second, I'll show\nyou the Windows 10 though process.\n\n363\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.013\nSo right here, if we look at,\nthere we go right there.\n\n364\n00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:07.100\nIf we look at Windows 10 and how we do it,\na little bit different in newer OS's.\n\n365\n00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.109\nOpen a command prompt,\n\n366\n00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.698\nneed administrative privileges to be able\nto do this right here, so just note that.\n\n367\n00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.742\nWe just run a command rd, right?\n\n368\n00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:18.652\nMinus or rather /s/q for\nquiet, specify the path.\n\n369\n00:17:18.652 --> 00:17:22.598\nIn this case, recycle bin or $Recycle.bin,\nand then restart the computer.\n\n370\n00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:25.576\nPardon me.\n\n371\n00:17:25.576 --> 00:17:27.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Restart the computer.\n\n372\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.248\nI always get sneezy when that happens.\n\n373\n00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.156\n&gt;&gt; Your're allergic to it.\n\n374\n00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:32.019\n&gt;&gt; I'm allergic to\nrestarting the Recycle Bin.\n\n375\n00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:33.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:34.506\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually allergic to the dust that\n\n377\n00:17:34.506 --> 00:17:36.009\njust got blown into my-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:37.550\n&gt;&gt; Nose, I think is what it was.\n\n379\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.899\nSo my apologies, I don´t normally sneeze\nwhen I'm talking to you on camera.\n\n380\n00:17:40.899 --> 00:17:45.560\nSo just to make sure we're aware of\nthe fact that BIOS as an investigator.\n\n381\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.460\nThere are different ways that we may\nhave to actually bring a real world\n\n382\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.720\nprocess to bear.\n\n383\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.703\nNot that you necessarily have to do\nthis or even do this very often.\n\n384\n00:17:52.703 --> 00:17:55.732\nAnd this may not be something you\nengage on in a regular basis.\n\n385\n00:17:55.732 --> 00:17:59.080\nBut it's one of those, hey, I may have\nto do it once in a while kind of things.\n\n386\n00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.995\nSuch probably have a note somewhere,\nbut more often than not,\n\n387\n00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:05.466\nyou wanna have to look this up when you\ndo it, if you don't do it very often.\n\n388\n00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:08.580\nA normal operation of just a normal\nmachine as an average user,\n\n389\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.510\nyou probably never run into an issue\nwhere the Recycle Bin gets corrupted.\n\n390\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.120\nThis is evidence of things like malware\nbeing on the system that may have modified\n\n391\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.950\na bunch of system files and environmental\nvariable paths and things like that.\n\n392\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.420\nSo there may be times when, just as\na normal user, you see this happen.\n\n393\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.460\nBut it's usually as a result of malware or\nsomething getting into the system.\n\n394\n00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.495\nThis is in other words,\ntypically purposefully bad behavior and\n\n395\n00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:32.601\nmodification that's done to cover tracks.\n\n396\n00:18:32.601 --> 00:18:36.427\nAnd so if we do see evidence of it, it is\nbecause somebody's been up to no good and\n\n397\n00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:39.072\nwe just wanna know that and\nhave a sense of that as well.\n\n398\n00:18:39.072 --> 00:18:42.100\nAnd in our minds kinda think\nthrough the logic of that, right?\n\n399\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.550\nAgain the idea in the Mac OS\nwould be the same, right?\n\n400\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.880\nWe do have the ability to move\nfiles to the trash folder,\n\n401\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.326\nthat's where they go by default.\n\n402\n00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:52.644\nIf we do bypass holding the shift and\ndelete key down, we can do that.\n\n403\n00:18:52.644 --> 00:18:56.919\nAnd I point out right down here,\nthat if we see that and\n\n404\n00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:59.940\nsee evidence of that right there.\n\n405\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.420\nThere are programs that\ncan be used on the Apple\n\n406\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.280\nsystem depending on the version\nof the Apple OS you're running.\n\n407\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.150\nThings like Time Machine,\nRemote Recover is a common one, MacKeeper.\n\n408\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.830\nThese are all programs that you may have\nhad access to or may have seen before.\n\n409\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.710\nIf you work on these platforms, that could\nbe used essentially to do what we were\n\n410\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.510\njust describing in the Windows world,\npull back deleted files.\n\n411\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.714\nDaniel, I think I asked\nyou before we got started,\n\n412\n00:19:19.714 --> 00:19:21.457\nat some point you told me you've used\nTime Machine once or twice, right?\n\n413\n00:19:21.457 --> 00:19:22.457\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've used Time Machine.\n\n414\n00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:26.350\n&gt;&gt; It's just essentially the ability to\ngo back and pull back that information.\n\n415\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.733\nAlmost like if not System Restore,\nnot the same exact concept.\n\n416\n00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:30.549\nBut the idea that we can go backwards and\n\n417\n00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:33.920\njust restore those files from\nthe hidden cache where they're sitting.\n\n418\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.846\nEven though they've been removed in\ntheory from the graphical interface is\n\n419\n00:19:36.846 --> 00:19:38.409\nessentially what we think about there.\n\n420\n00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:41.721\nTime machine became a built\nin feature in the MAC OS X,\n\n421\n00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:44.972\nstarting with the 10.5\nin the Leopard version.\n\n422\n00:19:44.972 --> 00:19:48.308\nSo you may or may not see that again as\nI suggested depending on the version you\n\n423\n00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:49.990\nrun, but just be aware of that.\n\n424\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.300\nWe can do the same thing in Linux as well,\nyou can see Linux file recovery,\n\n425\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.910\njust down here at the bottom\nof my notes right there.\n\n426\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.040\nSince we're talking about it,\njust throw it up there for you.\n\n427\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.231\nRemember, if we delete them in Linux,\nwe're deleting them into the bin.rm\n\n428\n00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:08.884\ndirectory most likely as long as they're\nremaining on the disk, as we talked about.\n\n429\n00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:11.700\nAgain they're recoverable,\njust as anything else would be.\n\n430\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.314\nAnd if an executable is deleted,\n\n431\n00:20:13.314 --> 00:20:16.089\nwe can retrieve the contents\nfrom the proc memory image.\n\n432\n00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:19.972\nThe process memory image that's formulate\nsystem executables are running,\n\n433\n00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:22.340\nand therefore,\ntheir contents are in memory.\n\n434\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.253\nThe command that is right here cp /proc,\nwhoops,\n\n435\n00:20:26.253 --> 00:20:27.553\nhold on one sec-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:20:27.553 --> 00:20:29.246\n&gt;&gt; Kind of went sideways there,\n\n437\n00:20:29.246 --> 00:20:33.036\ncp /proc the PID ID, so the $PID,\nright whatever that would be,\n\n438\n00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:37.955\nexecutable temp file, and highlight\nthe whole thing, you get the idea there.\n\n439\n00:20:37.955 --> 00:20:40.688\nIt will create a copy of a file\ninto a temp directory force.\n\n440\n00:20:40.688 --> 00:20:43.695\nWe can then pull that out and\nforensically examine that.\n\n441\n00:20:43.695 --> 00:20:45.165\nSo we can actually dump\nthe contents of that.\n\n442\n00:20:45.165 --> 00:20:49.165\nWhen we do the operating system\nforensics conversations coming up.\n\n443\n00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:52.735\nWe'll actually talk about Linux forensics,\nMicrosoft Windows forensics,\n\n444\n00:20:52.735 --> 00:20:53.975\nMac forensics.\n\n445\n00:20:53.975 --> 00:20:57.575\nWe'll talk about a lot of\nthe log areas and files and\n\n446\n00:20:57.575 --> 00:21:00.415\nthings you wanna look at and\npaths to find all of them.\n\n447\n00:21:00.415 --> 00:21:03.870\nAnd so we'll go into and give you a list\nof a lot of the places where data\n\n448\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.457\nmay be found and things that you may\nwanna know about should be lurking.\n\n449\n00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:11.510\nBut we can go in and create a dump of\nthe proc memory image and grab that.\n\n450\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.590\nAnd as a result see what is running and\nbe able to then get that volatile data\n\n451\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.840\nwhich would be the kind of\nthing we're looking up there.\n\n452\n00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.490\nSo we wanna be able to know right in our\nminds that there's lots of ways to recover\n\n453\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.110\nacross multiple operating systems.\n\n454\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.783\nWe do need to keep in mind that this\nis not just a Windows world, right?\n\n455\n00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:31.159\nAnd more and more, a majority of web\nhosting, certainly these days a very large\n\n456\n00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:35.160\namount of it goes into the Linux world\nas opposed to the Microsoft world.\n\n457\n00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.050\nA lot of the virtualization environments,\n\n458\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.840\nthe cloud environments we're running,\nare not Microsoft centric.\n\n459\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.440\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe have to be comfortable with operating\n\n460\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.110\non alternate platforms as\na forensic investigator.\n\n461\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.440\nBecause that's where we may be\ncalled to do a lot of our work and\n\n462\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.290\nif we're not comfortable with those\nskills, we may have some issues.\n\n463\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.150\nWe just wanna make sure,\nwe're aware of that.\n\n464\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.660\nWhat about dispartitions, right?\n\n465\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.962\nAnd where you store your stuff?\n\n466\n00:21:55.962 --> 00:22:00.140\nAnd obviously, we've talked about the\npartitions and the fact that we need them.\n\n467\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.865\nBut what happens when\na partition is deleted, right?\n\n468\n00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:04.018\nI wanna keep in mind and\n\n469\n00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:07.906\nthink about the fact that literally\npartitions can be deleted and the data,\n\n470\n00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:10.900\ncan we go full screen just so\nyou can see the bottom of that?\n\n471\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.565\nThere we go, thank you.\n\n472\n00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:13.997\nBecause I realized I looked up,\nI'm hovering over part of it.\n\n473\n00:22:13.997 --> 00:22:16.120\nWhen that partition is deleted, right?\n\n474\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.420\nAll of the data that is there is not lost,\nas we know, right?\n\n475\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.820\nIt's still there, this is just essentially\nlike deleting an individual file.\n\n476\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.230\nThe concept's the same,\nexcept you're deleting more, right?\n\n477\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.120\nThe partition is just\nthe logical reference\n\n478\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.570\nabout how we carve up\nthe geometry of the drive.\n\n479\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.800\nWhen we format and partition a drive, we\nare saying, I want this amount of space.\n\n480\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.370\nWe went through and\n\n481\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.030\ntalked about all this in the hard drive\nepisodes that we went through, right?\n\n482\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.130\nThe hard drive and file system episodes.\n\n483\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.620\nWe carved out a certain amount of space,\nwe allocate so many sectors, so\n\n484\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.730\nmany clusters, so many bits, bytes, etc.\n\n485\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.340\nWe create that partition,\nprobably mark it as bootable.\n\n486\n00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.310\nSo therefore it's a primary\npartition to load an OS.\n\n487\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.870\nAnd therefore, we're saying this amount of\nspace in the drive is allocated to this\n\n488\n00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.970\nkind of activity.\n\n489\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.904\nWhen we delete that partition, what we're\ndoing is removing the references in\n\n490\n00:23:01.904 --> 00:23:03.793\nthe file allocation table, the MBR.\n\n491\n00:23:03.793 --> 00:23:07.921\nThe master boot record, etc, on the drive\nthat tell us in those protected sectors in\n\n492\n00:23:07.921 --> 00:23:09.600\nthe beginning of the drive.\n\n493\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.017\nHow to use the drive and how to see\npartitions and what's active and\n\n494\n00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.185\nhow to boot from them.\n\n495\n00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:17.350\nWe're simply removing a reference to that,\nbut if we don't go back and\n\n496\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.990\nreallocate that space.\n\n497\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.780\nKeep in mind, we're not doin,g\nanything with the data that's there.\n\n498\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.590\nAnd unless we've done something\nlike low level format,\n\n499\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.580\nthe drive to remove all data across those\nsectors, the majority of it anyway, right?\n\n500\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.600\nWe're gonna still see\nthat data being there,\n\n501\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.490\nwe just have to use\ntools that can go back.\n\n502\n00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.630\nAnd essentially create that scheme and\nlay out the entire drive and\n\n503\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.930\nallocate the space and\ntell us what's there, so we can access it.\n\n504\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.552\nAnd that's what we're doing when\nwe use these drive editors.\n\n505\n00:23:44.552 --> 00:23:48.805\nOr these systems that mount these images,\nwe're just reading the raw data and\n\n506\n00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:51.910\nignoring the concept of hey,\nI'm an operating system.\n\n507\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.296\nI need a bootable partition,\nwe're ignoring those rules,\n\n508\n00:23:54.296 --> 00:23:55.716\nwe're just saying I'm a program.\n\n509\n00:23:55.716 --> 00:23:58.167\nI'm mounting everything as data,\nshow me all data.\n\n510\n00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:01.976\nAnd essentially then whatever data is\nthere becomes visible regardless of\n\n511\n00:24:01.976 --> 00:24:05.440\nstructure, regardless of gates or\npartitions or boundaries.\n\n512\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.620\nAnd then we're able to selectively\nreach in and grab what we want.\n\n513\n00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.540\nAnd this is the idea behind this, right?\n\n514\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.723\nSo keep in mind that when we\ndelete the data the [INAUDIBLE] or\n\n515\n00:24:12.723 --> 00:24:15.020\nrather the partition right,\nthe logical drive is lost but\n\n516\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.230\nthat doesn't mean that\nwe can't recover it.\n\n517\n00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.680\nDeleting partitions on a dynamic disk\ndoes delete all the dynamic volumes and\n\n518\n00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.640\nwill corrupt the state of the drive, but\n\n519\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.360\nthat doesn't mean that we can't\nagain get that data back.\n\n520\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.510\nIt just means we may not be able to mount\nthat drive using traditional operating\n\n521\n00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.350\nsystems and figure out what's there.\n\n522\n00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.650\nOkay so can we go back to full screen\nagain because we're covering part of that.\n\n523\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.240\nThank you.\n\n524\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.260\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n525\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.340\nBut again, not lost, right,\nbecause we can go in.\n\n526\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.780\nAnd we can recover, as we suggested.\n\n527\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.550\nSo partition recover in Windows.\n\n528\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.280\nWhat do we do?\n\n529\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.260\nRecovery console,\nthrough the install media may be used.\n\n530\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.180\nRemove the hard drive\nfrom the source media,\n\n531\n00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.200\nmount it as a slave in another machine.\n\n532\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.370\nWe talked about using\nthird-party recovery software.\n\n533\n00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.560\nWe have different mechanisms,\ndifferent methodologies,\n\n534\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.410\ndifferent ways of approaching this\ninformation and recovering it.\n\n535\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.440\nWe just need to keep in mind\nthat we have options, right.\n\n536\n00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.490\nAnd what we've demonstrated\nin some walk-throughs already\n\n537\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.270\nis third party recovery software, right.\n\n538\n00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.562\nWe haven't actually shown you that we\nwould physically remove a hard drive and\n\n539\n00:25:11.562 --> 00:25:13.090\nmount it into another machine.\n\n540\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.010\nBut keep in mind, creating an image and\nthen mounting it somewhere else is\n\n541\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.290\nessentially doing that to then let third\nparty recovery software operate on it.\n\n542\n00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.200\nWe're not mounting the actual hard drive,\nbut we're mounting a representation of\n\n543\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.030\nthe hard drive, the actual image itself,\nso you've kind of seen me combine two and\n\n544\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.930\nthree together if you wanna think\nabout it that way logically, right?\n\n545\n00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.120\nAnd so we can do that.\n\n546\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.280\nNow, the recovery console\nthrough the install media.\n\n547\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.180\nThat's not something we've demonstrated,\nbut you've probably seen this if you\n\n548\n00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.150\nrestart Windows 10 or whatever version\nof Linux or whatever OS you have.\n\n549\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.160\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n550\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.880\nUsing the install media, there's some sort\nof recovery option that we built into\n\n551\n00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.490\nthe install media that you can use\nto go back in and fix damaged files,\n\n552\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.690\nlike setup and fix the NT Loader or\nfix the MBR, things like that.\n\n553\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.470\nWhatever it may be, and\nif you use that recovery option\n\n554\n00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.310\nsometimes you can actually mount\nthe drive and see the data.\n\n555\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.843\nI'm not saying it will work,\nI'm not saying it is the best method.\n\n556\n00:26:02.843 --> 00:26:06.362\nA lot of times it will not work\ndepending on the damage involved, but\n\n557\n00:26:06.362 --> 00:26:09.000\nit's an option and\nwe can certainly do that.\n\n558\n00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.680\nAnd we may try that before\nwe try something else.\n\n559\n00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.620\nOr we may just jump right through and say,\nI don't have a copy of the install medium.\n\n560\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.390\nEven if I did I'm gonna have\nlimited access to the data.\n\n561\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.100\nIt's gonna be hard to\nwork with forensically,\n\n562\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.150\nmaybe it's not a good approach for me.\n\n563\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.240\nThis may be more of a hey, I have a home\ncomputer, something's screwed up,\n\n564\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.760\nI wanna recover it at home.\n\n565\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.480\nMaybe that's the approach we\nstart with cuz I don't have\n\n566\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.905\naccess to another machine.\n\n567\n00:26:30.905 --> 00:26:33.675\nI don't have access to\nforensics recovery software.\n\n568\n00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:34.765\nI'm not familiar with how to use it.\n\n569\n00:26:34.765 --> 00:26:38.405\nSo, people may use item number one or\nstep one here, but\n\n570\n00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:41.925\nthat may not be the tried and true\nmethod for the forensic investigators.\n\n571\n00:26:41.925 --> 00:26:44.855\nThis may be a helpdesk approach,\nright, trying to recover something.\n\n572\n00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:45.655\nAlthough in the help desk,\n\n573\n00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:47.516\nwe're probably gonna reimage\n[INAUDIBLE] than anything else.\n\n574\n00:26:47.516 --> 00:26:48.545\nRight, we don't care\nabout the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n575\n00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:50.340\nWe're like, hey, you know what,\n\n576\n00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.010\nyou're gonna get your data back from the\nup on the file share where we mapped it or\n\n577\n00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.020\nit's gonna give you back a new\noperational environment.\n\n578\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Listen, if I gotta spend more than\nten minutes on a problem they're getting\n\n579\n00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.180\na re-imaged machine.\n\n580\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.690\n&gt;&gt; That's a standing rule.\n\n581\n00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.470\nBut this is also why,\nall kidding aside right.\n\n582\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.380\nWe joke about that and In the real\nworld unfortunately that is, more or\n\n583\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.960\nless, a standing unofficial rule of thumb.\n\n584\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.440\nAnd perhaps even an official\nmethodology in many companies.\n\n585\n00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.290\nAnd as a result,\nwe often miss the opportunity forensically\n\n586\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.000\nto investigate a machine,\nbecause if that machine is re-imaged,\n\n587\n00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.540\neven though we bring back\nthe user data in theory, right?\n\n588\n00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.610\nThe files system, or rather the files\nmapped to, let's say, the X drive, or\n\n589\n00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.250\nwhatever it was, where the user\nredirects through their profile.\n\n590\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.470\nThe data, we can recover the user data.\n\n591\n00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.400\nGood for the user, bad for\nthe forensic professional,\n\n592\n00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.500\nbecause the underlying OS and\nthe bits that we would have to examine\n\n593\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.900\nare probably blown out through that\nre-imaging process on that drive.\n\n594\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.340\nAnd we're not gonna have any really\nusable, valuable data to go after and\n\n595\n00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.810\nthat can be a problem.\n\n596\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.160\nSo that is something to\nthink about as well.\n\n597\n00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.914\nSo we do need to understand that there\nare some concerns here on both sides of\n\n598\n00:27:51.914 --> 00:27:55.020\nthe divide, but chances are we're probably\nnot going to go with item number one even\n\n599\n00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.101\nthough it is something we\nshould listen and be aware of.\n\n600\n00:27:57.101 --> 00:28:03.080\nAs a forensic investigator we're most\nlikely gonna go with items either 2 or 3.\n\n601\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.550\nWe may remove and choose to remount,\nmounting as a slave essentially mounts\n\n602\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.980\nthe drive as a data source as opposed\nto a bootable partition for the OS.\n\n603\n00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.950\nYou may have done this.\n\n604\n00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.060\nI've done this a lot with recovering\nsystems where you'll literally have had\n\n605\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.330\na hard drive fail,\ngotta get the data off it.\n\n606\n00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.370\nSo we do the old put it in the freezer\ntrick, right, to get it super cool, and\n\n607\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.420\nas a result make the platters\nperhaps available.\n\n608\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.230\nThe electronics may allow us one or\ntwo more action items in there to get in.\n\n609\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.726\nYou ever done that,\nwhere you have a drive that gets wet,\n\n610\n00:28:30.726 --> 00:28:32.091\nyou'd throw it in the bag\nof rice to dry it out?\n\n611\n00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:32.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI've done the bag of rice, yeah.\n\n612\n00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:34.587\n&gt;&gt; And things like that, and\nthen you know, you go ahead and\n\n613\n00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:36.488\nmount it and you get maybe five\nminutes out of it, kind of thing?\n\n614\n00:28:36.488 --> 00:28:37.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n615\n00:28:37.492 --> 00:28:39.280\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it is, pulled the data off it.\n\n616\n00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.190\nSo, you know, a lot of times,\n\n617\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.950\nwe'll have these slave sleeves that we\ncan use outside that are just readers.\n\n618\n00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.710\nYou put the drive in, mounts as a slave,\nput the primary drive in.\n\n619\n00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.320\nYou copy it too, you image it or\nsomething like that.\n\n620\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.740\nWe've shown you some examples in earlier\nepisodes about drive blockers, and\n\n621\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.430\nrewriters, where we could literally\nput the drives on top and\n\n622\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.480\nthey just operate back and forth,\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n623\n00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.510\nBut third-party recovery software is\nthe one we've actually demonstrated in\n\n624\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.370\na walk-through.\n\n625\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.940\nThis is the one where we\nmount the drive images,\n\n626\n00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.110\nthe DD image that we've\nshown you in several cases.\n\n627\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.770\nSo just wanna make sure we're aware of\nsome of the concepts associated with file\n\n628\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.990\ndeletion, manipulation of data on the\nsurface versus the actuality of the data\n\n629\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.560\nunderneath, and how we as\ninvestigators can cut through that and\n\n630\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.320\nknow with relative assurance\nthat we can go back in and\n\n631\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.120\ngrab that data, provided that we\nunderstand how the deletion was done.\n\n632\n00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.950\nAnd as long, as I said, there's been no\nrewriting of the drive at a low level,\n\n633\n00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.950\nalmost without exception that\ndata's gonna be sitting there.\n\n634\n00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.430\nIt's just a matter of us going back and\nfinding it.\n\n635\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.790\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nJust because we hit the delete button\n\n636\n00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.440\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthat data is totally gone,\n\n637\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.680\nwe very well may be able to retrieve\nit using these techniques and tools.\n\n638\n00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.590\nVery cool stuff, Adam.\n\n639\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.870\nI appreciate your time here today.\n\n640\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.690\nBut I'm looking at that clock and it's\nscreaming at us again that it's all done,\n\n641\n00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.070\nat least for this episode.\n\n642\n00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.910\nCome back, we've got more to go.\n\n643\n00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.285\nWhen it comes to\nanti-forensic techniques or\n\n644\n00:29:54.285 --> 00:29:57.080\nanti-anti-forensic techniques\nshould I say.\n\n645\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.990\nAnd so\ndefinitely check that out coming up.\n\n646\n00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.700\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n647\n00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.280\nFor ITPRO.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n648\n00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:04.961\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n649\n00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:06.903\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n650\n00:30:06.903 -->

are watching IT pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:17.232\n&gt;&gt; All right, everyone and welcome\nback to another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:19.200\nI am your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n6\n00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.720\nAnd today's episode, well we're back for\nmore with our CHFI version 9 series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.280\nWe thank you for joining us, and\n\n8\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.830\nthe us implied there again,\nis our good friend Mr. Adam Gordan.\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.861\nAdam, glad to hear you again, [CROSSTALK]\nAll right, well we'll switch it up.\n\n10\n00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:35.180\nYeah, have a little variety in your life.\n\n11\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.670\n&gt;&gt; It's like an upside down U, you can\nkind of flip it and does either way.\n\n12\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.690\nIt's kind of like it's two Us.\n\n13\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.580\nIt's like one or\nthe other joined together.\n\n14\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.394\nIt's twice as good as being the same way,\nso I am good.\n\n15\n00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:46.530\nHopefully, you are as well, and\nthank you for coming back and\n\n16\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.473\njoining both Daniel and myself here.\n\n17\n00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:52.245\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\nabout how we deal with the anti-forensics\n\n18\n00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:55.964\nmindset, the anti-forensics tools\nassociated with that, and the mechanisms,\n\n19\n00:00:55.964 --> 00:00:59.120\nmethodologies, and the approaches\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n20\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.870\nIn our last episode we had dealt with and\n\n21\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.890\ntalked about storage, and files, and\nrecycle bin, and things that may or\n\n22\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740\nmay not be there after we delete them and\nhow to deal with all that.\n\n23\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.260\nWe're gonna take a turn now and really\nfocus in on another area that's equally\n\n24\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.764\nimportant, passwords, and\npassword protection of data.\n\n25\n00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:19.339\nBad actors are certainly gonna\nuse cryptography just like we do\n\n26\n00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:22.450\nto protect our data,\nprovide confidentiality.\n\n27\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.190\nOn the defensive side, they certainly\nwanna benefit from that and wanna have\n\n28\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.600\nconfidentiality and understand the value\nof hiding their data from us and so, they\n\n29\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.900\nmay very well try to protect their data\nwith passwords and or encrypt or both.\n\n30\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.920\nAnd so, we have to think about the types\nof passwords we see out there.\n\n31\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.430\nThe protection they provide, the attacks\nwe may be able to launch against them in\n\n32\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160\norder to recover passwords.\n\n33\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160\nWe've done some extensive conversations\nabout this in the CEH content.\n\n34\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.753\nIf you haven't seen those episodes,\nI certainly encourage you to go back and\n\n35\n00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:51.646\ntake a look there.\n\n36\n00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:54.557\nWe talked about password\ncracking as a methodology,\n\n37\n00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:58.439\ntalk about the ways in which we can\ndo that, talked about this in CISSP,\n\n38\n00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.579\nin the SSTP classes from ICE squared,\nand even in CASP, and Security Plus,\n\n39\n00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.120\nand some of the common content\nthere from the CompTIA side.\n\n40\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.610\nSo in multiple different\nshows in different areas,\n\n41\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.070\nwe talk about this as a theme.\n\n42\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.800\nThat's how important,\n\n43\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.480\nhow basic, how central it is to\nour conversations around security.\n\n44\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.790\nSo Daniel, if I asked you,\nif you don't mind playing for a minute.\n\n45\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.770\nYou're always so\n\n46\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.660\nwilling to participate when I randomly\nthrow a question over the fence your way.\n\n47\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.492\nSo if I ask you, what do you think\nare some of the key password types,\n\n48\n00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:26.605\ncategories, or\ntypes of passwords we would see?\n\n49\n00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.950\nAnd what are some of the things we\nwant to put on that list for people.\n\n50\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.530\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\nSo password types.\n\n51\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.769\nBasically, there's passwords\nthat are stored in a clear,\n\n52\n00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.209\nthat you send over tools like Telnet,\nFTP, that kind of thing.\n\n53\n00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.620\nYou have encrypted or\nobfuscated passwords.\n\n54\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.840\nSomething that has actually\nbeen randomized to an extent,\n\n55\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.250\nthat hopefully is not easily\nregenerated back to it's original form.\n\n56\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.930\nAnd then you have hash values as well,\nwhich is basically running it through\n\n57\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.785\na hash calculator, as we've seen\nmultiple times in this series so far.\n\n58\n00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.804\n&gt;&gt; So absolutely correct, and we´re\ngonna go, just a second, not quite yet,\n\n59\n00:02:58.804 --> 00:02:59.650\nbut we´re gonna go.\n\n60\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.326\nTake a look at the concept of what dealing\nwith hash passwords may involve in terms\n\n61\n00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:06.667\nof something known as rainbow tables,\nat least one possibility.\n\n62\n00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.217\nBut we do have clear text passwords,\n\n63\n00:03:08.217 --> 00:03:11.987\nas Daniel indicated, passwords that are\nliterally sent in the clear as he said.\n\n64\n00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:14.940\nUse the good old-fashioned Telnet or\ntools like that, or\n\n65\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.876\nprotocols that may send in the clear.\n\n66\n00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:20.281\nAnd we may be able to sniff those\npasswords, literally off the wire,\n\n67\n00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:23.158\nand remove them from the traffic pattern,\npull them out,\n\n68\n00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:25.492\nand then, see them and\nuse them accordingly.\n\n69\n00:03:25.492 --> 00:03:28.607\nI'm not obviously a very good security\nsolution, if we're doing that and\n\n70\n00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:29.890\nallowing that to happen.\n\n71\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.860\nBut, you know, every so often,\n\n72\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.660\nwe get older systems, you get systems that\nhave not been hardened, you get people\n\n73\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.960\nthat don't realize that this is occuring\nand they may fall prey into this.\n\n74\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.890\nThe average bad actor and\nthe thread actor,\n\n75\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.460\nthe hacker is probably not\ngonna fall prey to this.\n\n76\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.370\nYou're probably not gonna easily find\npasswords being sent in the clear,\n\n77\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.270\nbut good to know.\n\n78\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.059\nThey maybe stored in files somewhere else\nin the system without being transmit,\n\n79\n00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.349\nyou may find them that way.\n\n80\n00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.030\nSo there is always that possibility,\nright.\n\n81\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.759\nYou should go buy a lottery ticket,\nby the way, that happens.\n\n82\n00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're probably\nthe luckiest person around.\n\n84\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.239\nBut obfuscated passwords as Daniel\nsuggested that have been randomized or\n\n85\n00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.564\npseudo randomized as we refer to them to\nbe presented in some encrypted form and\n\n86\n00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:09.420\ntherefore not representative\nin clear text.\n\n87\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.000\nBut rather some approximation\nof that in seemingly garbled or\n\n88\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.740\nrandom characters letters or\nnumbers whatever that will be.\n\n89\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.610\nThose are more traditional hashes\nwhich represent the password, but\n\n90\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.540\nare not the actual password itself.\n\n91\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.330\nBut a cryptographic representation\nof it as an integrity mechanism\n\n92\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.130\nwould be available to us most\nlikely through network sniffing.\n\n93\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.360\nSo we very likely can find\neither the obfuscated or\n\n94\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.190\nencrypted passwords themselves\ntransmitted inside the network traffic or\n\n95\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.920\nhashes that are being sent back and\nforth to do validation.\n\n96\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.850\nAnd we usually will take hashes and\nattempt to validate the passwords\n\n97\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.130\nusing a process known as rainbow tables or\nrather the tool known as rainbow tables.\n\n98\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.450\nBut the process of trying to break\nthe hashes by literally decoding them.\n\n99\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.630\nShowing what the hash is against computed\nvalues that equal what the hash value\n\n100\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.209\nwould be.\n\n101\n00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:02.420\nAnd if we see a match, we know, although\nwe have not actually gotten the password.\n\n102\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.870\nWe know we do have the representation and\nthat we know the password is.\n\n103\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.690\nSo imagine if I said to you\na equals 1 b equals 2 c equals 3,\n\n104\n00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.350\nif you think of the logic that quite in\nnumbers and letters, and saying instead of\n\n105\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.690\nthe password abc, I sent to harsh value\nthat was generated that represented that.\n\n106\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.840\nAnd if I had a table that generated every\npossible permutation of the letter number\n\n107\n00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.260\ncombinations, great passwords,\nand the hash values, and\n\n108\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.090\nI walk through that able using\nmost likely an automated process.\n\n109\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.280\nEither some sort of comparison script, or\n\n110\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.310\na tool like L0phtCrack, PW dom,\nJohn the Ripper, whatever it may be.\n\n111\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.880\nThat would allow us to be able to go\nthrough and do a quick comparison.\n\n112\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.760\nI would most likely then be able to\nsay definitively, hey, guess what?\n\n113\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.380\nI found the hash string and\nthat equals 123 or abc, and so therefore,\n\n114\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.290\nthis hash equals this password.\n\n115\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.970\nSo without knowing the password, but\n\n116\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.330\nknowing all the possible combinations\nthat would generate the hashes,\n\n117\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.270\nI can essentially come up with or reverse\nengineer the password from the hash, and\n\n118\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.630\nthis is what we do when we\ndo rainbow table cracking.\n\n119\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.280\nSo if you join me here, to show you where\nyou may find lists of rainbow tables.\n\n120\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.980\nThing you gotta be careful about there,\nand we talked about this in our\n\n121\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.700\nethical hacking conversations, remind you\nof where it is, and is not safe to go.\n\n122\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.710\nAs an investigator,\nas a defensive security professional,\n\n123\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.670\nwe don't wanna invite malware and\nbad things into our network unnecessarily.\n\n124\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.340\nWe have enough to deal with on our own.\n\n125\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.920\nWithout having worry about\nbringing it in ourselves, and\n\n126\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.700\nso we got to be careful and make sure we\ngo into areas on the web that are safe and\n\n127\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.840\nare going to provide good information,\nand not perhaps, go traipsing around in\n\n128\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.100\nthe dark parts of the web where we may\nfind valuable Intel, valuable resources.\n\n129\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.530\nBut we have to be extra\nspecial careful and\n\n130\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.340\nvery vigilant that we're not bringing\nback some unknown traveler, right?\n\n131\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.210\nThis is like the Alien plot, right?\n\n132\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.390\nBut for the computing network, you\nsuddenly open up that piece of software,\n\n133\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.060\nand you've infected the entire system.\n\n134\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.470\nSo we have to be really\ncareful about that, right?\n\n135\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.020\nBut here, this particular site, Project\nRainbowCrack is the name of the site.\n\n136\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.962\nWhen you go there, and\n\n137\n00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:07.491\nI'm kind of pointing to RainbowCrack up at\nthe left hand corner there so you can see.\n\n138\n00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:10.610\nThey do have lists of rainbow\ntables pre-computered here.\n\n139\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.400\nSafe site to go to, not gonna worry about\ndownloading rainbow tables from here and\n\n140\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.790\nwinding up with any problems.\n\n141\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.360\nBut just so you know, they do have some\nnice how to videos, if I wanna do a hash\n\n142\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.730\ncrack with rainbow tables for the MD5\nASCII 32 characters, that kinda thing.\n\n143\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.992\nWhat does that look like?\n\n144\n00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:29.710\nSo they've got some nice videos\njust showing us what would happen.\n\n145\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.750\nAnd they've got of course,\n\n146\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.540\nthe precomputed tables that\nare here that can be downloaded.\n\n147\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.830\nSo for instance, if we take a look and\nwe talked about using ASCII, and Unicode\n\n148\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.880\ncharacter sets, what the difference is\nthere would be, and things of that nature.\n\n149\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.555\nRemember all the letters and numbers,\nA through Z, lower a through z,\n\n150\n00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:50.536\nzero through nine, special characters\nwould be in the ASCII character set,\n\n151\n00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:53.379\nUnicode would have that plus\nall sorts of other stuff.\n\n152\n00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:57.925\n128,000 approximately characters that\nare there as opposed to the 128 that\n\n153\n00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.302\nare recognized in ASCII.\n\n154\n00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:02.365\nIn the standard set plus\nthe extended ones that go out.\n\n155\n00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:05.472\nSo we obviously, have some things\nto think about and work with here.\n\n156\n00:08:05.472 --> 00:08:10.556\nBut if you look for instance at\nthe size of a rainbow table, NTLM,\n\n157\n00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:17.040\nmixed alpha numeric, up to nine in this\ncase, plain text characters and lengths.\n\n158\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.426\nSo this one right here, you'll see that I\nhave a 96.8% chance of finding the hash,\n\n159\n00:08:23.426 --> 00:08:28.366\nand the match for it in the rainbow\ntable that's been precomputed.\n\n160\n00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:31.648\nSomebody, in other words,\nhas set up a computer and said, hey,\n\n161\n00:08:31.648 --> 00:08:34.140\ndo every permutation, generate out a file.\n\n162\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.849\nAnd then that's what we get\nwith the rainbow table.\n\n163\n00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:39.360\n96.8, let's just round that up,\nsay 97% chance.\n\n164\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.930\nI'll take those odds everyday,\nI say to all my customers and\n\n165\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.825\nmy students all the time.\n\n166\n00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:47.550\nIf I'm a bad actor, and I've got\na hundred hashes, that means 97 of them\n\n167\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.190\nare most likely gonna yield passwords\nin that list, if you think about that.\n\n168\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.620\nIf I get at least four hashes,\nI'm almost guaranteed,\n\n169\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.650\nI'm gonna find one out of\nfour in that list, right?\n\n170\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.100\nNow all I need is one to start picking\naway at the system and get in there.\n\n171\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo it's 690 gigs in size, today,\nthat's actually not that big.\n\n172\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.534\nYears ago we would've said, it's almost\nthree quarters of a terabyte, and\n\n173\n00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:10.417\nwe would've said, wow, that's ridiculous.\n\n174\n00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.064\nYou don't have the bandwidth\nto download that,\n\n175\n00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:13.790\nlet alone storage space\nto put it out there.\n\n176\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.455\nBut you could get that in\na download in a couple of hours,\n\n177\n00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:20.317\nit wouldn't take very long, depending\non where you're downloading from, and\n\n178\n00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:23.639\nin addition, you could store that\non an external USB drive, right?\n\n179\n00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:27.595\nI mean that's not a very large amount\nof storage today by any means.\n\n180\n00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:31.730\nAnd as a result,\nwe could then carry that with us, and\n\n181\n00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.460\nhave that ability to generate the ability\nfor us to go in and decouple those hashes,\n\n182\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.840\nand figure out passwords, if necessary.\n\n183\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.860\nDo we get the ability to dump hashes\nas part of a forensic investigation?\n\n184\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.500\nYeah, we definitely do.\n\n185\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.220\nYou've already seen that we create hashes\nto do integrity checks on the drive.\n\n186\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.090\nDo we find hashes lurking\nin the hard drive images?\n\n187\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.630\nAbsolutely, of course we do,\nbecause we're dumping the registry\n\n188\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.230\nof a system where those password hashes\nwould be stored if it's Windows.\n\n189\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.610\nThe equivalent in Linux in the etc file,\nor the etc password file, rather.\n\n190\n00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.380\nThe etc shadow file, if it's\nan encrypted stored set of passwords.\n\n191\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.235\nWe could still get hashes.\n\n192\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:07.082\nThey are gonna be resident\nin the data streams,\n\n193\n00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:08.730\nwe just have to know where to look.\n\n194\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.900\nSo, could we extract passwords?\n\n195\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.130\nYeah, but as an investigator, is that,\nprobably, gonna be as important to us\n\n196\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.260\nas a bad actor, trying to obfuscate their\ndata, and using passwords to do that?\n\n197\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.450\nAs important perhaps, perhaps not.\n\n198\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.400\nBut knowledge of that, and then using\nthose passwords to unencrypt the data,\n\n199\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.660\nunobfuscate them, and find, and read the\ndata, probably much more impactful for us.\n\n200\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.225\nRemember, we're talking about this now\nas an investigatative, investigatative,\n\n201\n00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:36.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to Wikipedia.\n\n202\n00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As an investigatory or\n\n203\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.570\ninvestigative process as I combined\nBrand new language words are constantly\n\n204\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.360\nemerging here, as we talk about this.\n\n205\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.260\nSo, either an investigative or\n\n206\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.120\ninvestigatory process, from our\nperspective, the value is most likely,\n\n207\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.030\nthat we wanna figure out what those\npasswords are, and decrypt the data.\n\n208\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.280\nNow, we'll show you, we do our hands and\nwalk through, some tools that may be able\n\n209\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.560\nto find the passwords, basic passwords\nassigned to things, like Word documents,\n\n210\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.150\nPDFs, whatever they may be.\n\n211\n00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.530\nWhere they do have passwords, but the\npasswords are typically not that complex.\n\n212\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.170\nAnd as a result, we may be able to\nknock off a document, decrypt it, and\n\n213\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.770\nopen it up with relative ease.\n\n214\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.960\nI'm not suggesting it's easy,\nI'm not suggesting it's hard.\n\n215\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.130\nI'm just saying, depends on the person\nwho's decided to implement that security\n\n216\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.820\nin the first place.\n\n217\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.480\nBut if they don't make good choices,\nwe may very quickly be able to decrypt it.\n\n218\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.890\nAnd we'll walk you through that, and\nshow you some of that in a little bit.\n\n219\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.480\nBut password cracking software is gonna\nbe used to do this traditionally.\n\n220\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.130\nI mentioned a bunch.\n\n221\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.450\nCain and Abel is another popular one,\nyou may have seen and\n\n222\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.880\ncertainly have heard of before.\n\n223\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.020\nBut we create a word list\nthat we then run through.\n\n224\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.250\nAnd we either do the comparison for,\nfor doing a hash,\n\n225\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.860\nwe have the hashes, we look for\nthe apple at the rainbow table.\n\n226\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.910\nWe have a dictionary or word list that we\nuse to do brute-force password cracking,\n\n227\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.770\ntrying every password combination\nto get into the file, or\n\n228\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.390\nget into the account until we find one.\n\n229\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.122\nA lot of times we'll grab\nthese offline systems, rather,\n\n230\n00:11:57.122 --> 00:12:01.180\nthese are cracking programs,\nwe'll extract the password hives or\n\n231\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.140\nthe databases, and then load them offline,\nand just have systems crank away at them.\n\n232\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.384\nCan actually do this in the cloud today,\nright?\n\n233\n00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:07.971\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you could load this stuff up,\n\n234\n00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:09.390\nand just have it run in the cloud.\n\n235\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.898\nAnd then, when you're done,\nor come back, and\n\n236\n00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.584\nfind out several hours later its there,\nyou get the unencrypted form.\n\n237\n00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:19.125\nAnd remember, we can scale massively\nin the cloud, and as a result,\n\n238\n00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:22.482\nwe can bring it there quite of\na large amount of processing power or\n\n239\n00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:24.910\ncomputing power against these systems.\n\n240\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.310\nAnd we can exponentially speed\nup our attack capabilities or\n\n241\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.000\nour decryption capabilities as a result.\n\n242\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.910\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n243\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.059\nSo dictionary attacks,\nbrute force attacks,\n\n244\n00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:37.768\nkinds of password-cracking techniques,\nhybrid attacks where we combine two or\n\n245\n00:12:37.768 --> 00:12:39.771\nmore techniques together, very popular.\n\n246\n00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:42.882\nWe could do a syllable attack,\nwhich is just a brute force and\n\n247\n00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:44.560\na dictionary attack combines.\n\n248\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.280\nAnother way to find out a hybrid attack,\nand a rule based attack.\n\n249\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.410\nWhere we use rules about the structure,\n\n250\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.990\nand makeup of passwords in order to\nnarrow down our search parameters.\n\n251\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.590\nImagine for instance, that we knew for\na fact that the password\n\n252\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.380\nwas made up of only lowercase characters\nin the English language set, a through z,\n\n253\n00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.540\nlowercase, no special characters, just\nalphanumeric but alpha lowercase only.\n\n254\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.230\nWe can narrow the search parameters, and\nthe filtering that would be created with\n\n255\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.160\nthe rules, essentially, for the password\ncracker would eliminate all uppercase\n\n256\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.950\ncharacters, all special characters\nin the ASCII character set.\n\n257\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.400\nThat trims down the number of\npossibilities exponentially, and\n\n258\n00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.900\nshortens what we would\ncall is the word factor.\n\n259\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.375\nThe amount of time it would take to break\nthe password or break the cryptography,\n\n260\n00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:28.100\ndramatically.\n\n261\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.838\nIn some cases by hundreds, thousands of\nyears, right, depending on what we're\n\n262\n00:13:31.838 --> 00:13:35.030\ndoing, and how large the potential\npool of passwords would be.\n\n263\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.990\nSo we can use rule based attacks as well,\nand you'll go in and try\n\n264\n00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.920\nto figure this out, but we can do password\nattacking as I mentioned online, right?\n\n265\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.250\nSo we can grab these either passively or\nactively by sniffing,\n\n266\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.640\ngrabbing this traffic through things like\nwire sniffing, man in the middle attacks,\n\n267\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.480\nwhere we are either passively or\nactively listening to the traffic.\n\n268\n00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.010\nMaybe even actively engaging\nin the dialog with or\n\n269\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.258\nbetween the two users that\nare essentially transmitting.\n\n270\n00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.448\nAnd we could spoof or masquerade\nas one by knocking somebody off,\n\n271\n00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:08.986\ntaking over their identity, and\nthen using that credentials to get in.\n\n272\n00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:11.940\nThere's all these different derivatives,\nright, of these kinds of attacks.\n\n273\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.724\nReplay attacks, where we use the session\nID to try to respawn the session and\n\n274\n00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:20.536\ngain access to the account,\nthe database, the webpage, or\n\n275\n00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:23.840\nwhatever the case may be\nin lieu of the real user.\n\n276\n00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.144\nWe use their session ID to try to do this.\n\n277\n00:14:26.144 --> 00:14:30.114\nWhen we are doing certain kinds of\nweb-based attacks, as we'll talk about in\n\n278\n00:14:30.114 --> 00:14:34.240\nsome upcoming conversations around web,\nhacking the web and web forensics.\n\n279\n00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.230\nThere's a whole list of about 25 or so\ndifferent things that we have to be\n\n280\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.980\naware of as potential attack vectors, The\nOWASP Top Ten Web App vulnerabilities, and\n\n281\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.870\nthings of that nature in that category.\n\n282\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:50.030\nOne of them is going to kinda align\nitself here, where we actually see one or\n\n283\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:56.300\nmore attacks that actually involve,\nwe call them fixed session attacks, right?\n\n284\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.100\nWhere we are session fixing attacks.\n\n285\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.340\nWhere we are trying to log in, and\n\n286\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.250\nyou get a user through a link to log in\nwith that session ID that we've already\n\n287\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.290\ncreated, capturing their ID, and then\nusing that ID to take over the session.\n\n288\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.140\nAnd instead of them thinking\nthey're logged into the bank and\n\n289\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.920\nbe able to check their information, we\ncome along, knock them off, use the replay\n\n290\n00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.960\nportion, or session grab portion of\nthat attack to take over the attack.\n\n291\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.250\nAnd we actually as a result,\nare able to get access to their account.\n\n292\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.170\nThis is all kind of sneaky stuff, but\n\n293\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.350\nthis is the stuff that\nhappens out there on the web.\n\n294\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.916\nThat's why you have to be very careful\nwhen you connect to these systems,\n\n295\n00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:34.539\nand look at proverbially as well as\nliterally, look at who's around you,\n\n296\n00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:37.495\nwhat they're doing,\nwhat kind of traffic you're seeing.\n\n297\n00:15:37.495 --> 00:15:40.435\nWhen I talk to people all the time,\nand I ask them, hey do you go online,\n\n298\n00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:41.450\ndo you do e-commerce?\n\n299\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.470\nYou pay for things online,\nebanking and things like that.\n\n300\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.760\nYou'll, yeah, yeah do that all the time.\n\n301\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.990\nWell, do you run a firewall\non your machine?\n\n302\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.100\nDo you run a port scanner on your machine?\n\n303\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.907\nAre you looking at inbound traffic?\n\n304\n00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:53.020\nThose kind of things.\n\n305\n00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.010\nAre you alerted when some sort of\nsuspicious behavior is happening?\n\n306\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.501\nEven if I was, I don't know if I am.\n\n307\n00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:01.429\nYou almost people say,\nI may have a firewall, I'm not sure.\n\n308\n00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:02.574\nWhat is a firewall?\n\n309\n00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:04.370\nAnd these are average individuals, right,\n\n310\n00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.507\nnot necessarily IT professionals\nsuch as all of you.\n\n311\n00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:10.319\nBut the reality is, if you think about the\nmajority of the people that are engaging\n\n312\n00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:13.000\nin this behavior, and\nwhere the attacks come from?\n\n313\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.877\nIt's traditionally coming from these\nareas where these people are operating.\n\n314\n00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:20.384\nAnd they don't necessarily know what to\ndo, and how to do it securely, all right.\n\n315\n00:16:20.384 --> 00:16:22.710\nSo these things we gotta think of,\nwe may be doing guessing,\n\n316\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.200\nmalware hash injection,\nas we talked about.\n\n317\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.602\nWe may be using the pre-computed\nrainbow tables as I showed you.\n\n318\n00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:30.677\nWe may be using shoulder surfing,\n\n319\n00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:34.190\na la the good old fashion\nsocial engineering mechanisms.\n\n320\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.757\nDumpster diving to go in and\nget passwords, where we just literally go\n\n321\n00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:41.210\ncrawling through the garbage,\nlooking for discarded passwords.\n\n322\n00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.988\nLook over someone's shoulder, or look\nat them and kind of see, maybe angled.\n\n323\n00:16:44.988 --> 00:16:47.091\nYou can kind of see someone's\nmonitor in the office,\n\n324\n00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:50.190\nget a sense of what they're doing, and\nmaybe you can see what they're doing.\n\n325\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.080\nMaybe keystrokes,\nmaybe use a keylogger of some kind.\n\n326\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.330\nto grab passwords or\nany kind of keystrokes, and\n\n327\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.720\neventually kind of figure\nout what's going on.\n\n328\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.320\n&gt;&gt; The oldies are always a goodie, right?\n\n329\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.850\nI mean, these are things that have\nbeen around for quite some time.\n\n330\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.970\nShoulder surfing, come on, I mean,\nthat's just a human ability.\n\n331\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.450\nYou don't have to be some special, crazy-\n&gt;&gt; No, you need superhero powers.\n\n332\n00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.031\n&gt;&gt; Spied out hacker, yeah,\nit's a look over [CROSSTALK]\n\n333\n00:17:09.031 --> 00:17:10.110\n&gt;&gt; You gotta be Shoulder-Surfer Man.\n\n334\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.929\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, come on over-\n&gt;&gt; Shoulder [CROSSTALK]\n\n335\n00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:11.830\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Adam, what are you doing?\n\n336\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.370\nAs he types in his password,\ndid you get that memo?\n\n337\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.700\nAnd, yeah, I didn't get that.\n\n338\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.450\nAnd he types in his password,\nand I watch the whole thing.\n\n339\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.290\nWhen I was a kid,\nI liked doing that thing,\n\n340\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.310\ncuz I felt like I was subverting,\nI don't know, authority or something.\n\n341\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.760\nThat was that hacker mindset\nalready in me, in middle school.\n\n342\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.100\n&gt;&gt; So you were saying you were a problem\nchild, and you became a problem adult.\n\n343\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.400\n&gt;&gt; I was shoulder surfing\ncombinations to people's lockers.\n\n344\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did that when I was\nin grade school, we all did.\n\n345\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.540\n&gt;&gt; I had a whole list of them, though, and\n\n346\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.270\nI could break into just\nabout anybody's locker.\n\n347\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.540\n&gt;&gt; See, I didn't go that far.\n\n348\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, yeah,\n\n349\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.350\nI know I can remember what\nthat combination was.\n\n350\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.360\nI saw it, okay, cool, but\nI never actually did that.\n\n351\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.710\n&gt;&gt; No, we kept databases,\nit was a little sick.\n\n352\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:58.260\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't quite that devious, but that's\nprobably why I'm shorter than you are.\n\n353\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.560\nCuz I just, I didn't use my knowledge for\ngood or evil, I just archived it.\n\n354\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.670\n&gt;&gt; You know what's funny is, sometimes I\nwould walk by, and I would see one number.\n\n355\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.388\nI'd just catch one number,\nand then two days later-\n\n356\n00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:08.264\n&gt;&gt; So you were stitching it together?\n\n357\n00:18:08.264 --> 00:18:11.944\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you never had that whole,\nI'm staring at what's going on.\n\n358\n00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:14.639\nAnd it sounds like, wow,\nthat seems like a lot of effort,\n\n359\n00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:16.400\nif you really wanna get in something?\n\n360\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.370\nIf a bad actor really\nwants to get at something,\n\n361\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.740\nthat's exactly the kind of thing that\nthey're gonna get into, they're gonna do.\n\n362\n00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.990\nThey're gonna do what\nit takes to get that.\n\n363\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.160\n&gt;&gt; They could also do what I'm\nabout to show you right now,\n\n364\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.460\nlet's take a look something\nthat makes it even easier.\n\n365\n00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.960\nWhat does that say right there?\n\n366\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.450\nAside from the gray alien, which is\nclearly where I'm getting this from.\n\n367\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.640\nBut this is one of the many\nsites that exist out there for\n\n368\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.260\nvendor default passwords, right?\n\n369\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Real problem,\npeople never change the password.\n\n370\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Don't change the password,\nwhy would you?\n\n371\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.340\nThe vendor sets it, must be good enough\nfor them, should be good enough for me.\n\n372\n00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.960\n&gt;&gt; It's already written\nin the documentation.\n\n373\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.431\n&gt;&gt; Why would I bother to change that?\n\n374\n00:18:48.431 --> 00:18:50.560\nThat's easy, right,\nI can just leave it there.\n\n375\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.310\nSo we've got all sorts of sites out there,\nthat give us these passwords.\n\n376\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.160\nAnd, again, you would have to\njust go out and search for them.\n\n377\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.950\nCRT.net is the one we're on right now.\n\n378\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.830\nIt's a little hard to see, but\n\n379\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.630\nit's in red right there, next to our\nlittle buddy, George, a resident alien.\n\n380\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.830\nBut you have things like the default\npassword site called Default Password,\n\n381\n00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.570\nno s, all one word.\n\n382\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.500\nDefault-Password with a .info on the end,\nall sorts of ones.\n\n383\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.860\nThere's a list of them in the show notes,\n\n384\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.630\nyou can take a look at\nthe common ones that are there.\n\n385\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.726\nBut you can see we've got just all\nsorts of different vendors here.\n\n386\n00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:23.359\nMaybe some ADT home alarm systems,\nfor instance, 3COM,\n\n387\n00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:26.200\nlord knows what would be lurking there.\n\n388\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.800\nMaybe some AdaptTech, adapter information\nfor storage networks, things like that.\n\n389\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Netgear and Linksys is in there.\n\n390\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.400\n&gt;&gt; Apple's in there,\nlet's see what they've got for\n\n391\n00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.540\nApple, that's always interesting.\n\n392\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.663\nSo let's see, for theIP hone, useID root,\npassword alpine, level administrator.\n\n393\n00:19:41.663 --> 00:19:45.239\nI don't know how common, and\ntherefore how appropriate that is now,\n\n394\n00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:47.066\nat this particular moment in time.\n\n395\n00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:50.786\nThat may or may not be what it is today,\nbut at some point in the past it was,\n\n396\n00:19:50.786 --> 00:19:51.710\nI don't know.\n\n397\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:56.482\nHere's another one called mobile,\npassword do dottie, password dottie?\n\n398\n00:19:56.482 --> 00:19:57.554\nI guess password dottie, yeah,\n\n399\n00:19:57.554 --> 00:19:59.750\nI'm not sure, I don't know how\naccurate those would be for today.\n\n400\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.717\nBut you get the general idea, right,\nand you have to do some hunting,\n\n401\n00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:05.047\nnot every one of these sites\nis gonna have everything.\n\n402\n00:20:05.047 --> 00:20:08.858\nBut as you start piecing them together,\nand find a site that has some good stuff\n\n403\n00:20:08.858 --> 00:20:12.180\non certain vendors,\nyou begin to build a list of these things.\n\n404\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.770\nAgain, knowing this kind of stuff would\nhelp an attacker to bypass security,\n\n405\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.450\nmaybe they can get through\nthe BIOS passwords.\n\n406\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.340\nThat's another common one we\nsee on servers and hardware.\n\n407\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.159\nYou're racked up in some of\nthis kind of stuff back here,\n\n408\n00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:26.820\na lot it will have BIOS\npasswords associated with it.\n\n409\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.957\nSo on boot or on restart,\n\n410\n00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:30.949\nyou have to enter a password to\nactually get the system to come up.\n\n411\n00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:34.936\nIt's very common in certain environments\nwhere we don't want people to be able to\n\n412\n00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:36.051\nget physical access.\n\n413\n00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:38.506\nAnd simply cycle the box and\nthen get in through a console,\n\n414\n00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:39.720\nthat kind of thing, right?\n\n415\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.360\nSo we may do that,\nif we have those passwords in place but\n\n416\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.890\nwe don't change the defaults,\nyou may find them on a site like that.\n\n417\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.383\nEasily allowing a hacker,\na bad actor, to bypass them, and\n\n418\n00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:53.341\nallowing them to then get in and\nmodify the system.\n\n419\n00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:56.582\nThis gets into active hacking, we're\nnot still talking about active hacking.\n\n420\n00:20:56.582 --> 00:21:01.101\nBut we are talking about antiforensics,\nand the line between antiforensics and\n\n421\n00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:03.170\nactive hacking is really not a line.\n\n422\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.860\nIt's just a state of mind, right,\n\n423\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.570\npending on how far we're willing\nto go to hide our activities.\n\n424\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.330\nSo we have to keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that,\n\n425\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.860\nso these kind of sites can be valuable for\nus.\n\n426\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.020\nThey're valuable for us as investigators,\n\n427\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.920\nbecause they allow us to understand\nwhat the default settings may be.\n\n428\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.006\nIf we have to investigate hacking into\na complete set of infrastructure systems,\n\n429\n00:21:24.006 --> 00:21:26.157\nincluding, let's say, PBXes.\n\n430\n00:21:26.157 --> 00:21:28.944\nMaybe people hacked in,\ntried to get our call list, or\n\n431\n00:21:28.944 --> 00:21:32.717\nget access to the PBX to start making\nphone calls without paying for them.\n\n432\n00:21:32.717 --> 00:21:33.773\nOr who knows what,\n\n433\n00:21:33.773 --> 00:21:38.337\nmaybe they tried to dump our voicemail\nmessages, and/or puts fake messages in.\n\n434\n00:21:38.337 --> 00:21:41.624\nSo all this stuff that we see,\nwe may need the default passwords and\n\n435\n00:21:41.624 --> 00:21:44.913\nthe configuration information,\nby vendor, for those systems,\n\n436\n00:21:44.913 --> 00:21:46.730\nto be able to get into them.\n\n437\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.485\nSo again, this is something that could\nbe valuable for us, as a starting point.\n\n438\n00:21:50.485 --> 00:21:54.670\nTypically, we would get that information\nfrom the administrator of record.\n\n439\n00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.798\nIf we're there, doing a traditional and\nlegitimate forensic investigation,\n\n440\n00:21:57.798 --> 00:21:59.688\nthey're going to share\nthat knowledge with us.\n\n441\n00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:04.690\nNot that they're going to keep it from us,\nbut there have been times were I had to\n\n442\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.780\nget into systems in an investigation\nwhere, or just in some sort of process.\n\n443\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.829\nAnd the person that would have that\ninformation was not available, or\n\n444\n00:22:12.829 --> 00:22:14.127\nwhat they had didn't match.\n\n445\n00:22:14.127 --> 00:22:16.906\nBecause now,\nthe hacker had reset the passwords,\n\n446\n00:22:16.906 --> 00:22:19.624\nor done something else,\nand we couldn't get in.\n\n447\n00:22:19.624 --> 00:22:21.768\nOr documentation could not be found,\n\n448\n00:22:21.768 --> 00:22:25.020\nbecause it was destroyed\nafter some sort of disaster.\n\n449\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.187\nWe had to reproduce and\n\n450\n00:22:26.187 --> 00:22:29.512\nget back in to the system,\nmaybe without all of that knowledge.\n\n451\n00:22:29.512 --> 00:22:33.447\nSo yeah, there are times where you can\nreset the system to factory spec or\n\n452\n00:22:33.447 --> 00:22:34.037\ndefault.\n\n453\n00:22:34.037 --> 00:22:38.083\nAnd then you would have to know what\nthe password is, to get in as the default,\n\n454\n00:22:38.083 --> 00:22:41.970\nto essentially get back in to start\nforensically examining or whatever.\n\n455\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.150\nAnd yeah, zapping the system,\n\n456\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.230\nsetting it back to factory default,\nis not the first-line approach.\n\n457\n00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.244\nBut when it's the difference between,\nhey, at least we can get in and\n\n458\n00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:52.350\nstart to see what's there,\nand we have no clue.\n\n459\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.218\nAnd if we keep hacking away, at some\npoint, we're just gonna run out of options\n\n460\n00:22:56.218 --> 00:22:59.250\nand break the system,\nwe may actually reset the system.\n\n461\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.240\nSo that point,\nwe don't have anything to lose,\n\n462\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.794\nwe know the system's not operational, we\nknow that the system's been compromised.\n\n463\n00:23:04.794 --> 00:23:06.858\nWe're not worried now about that,\nwere worried about getting in and\n\n464\n00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:08.220\nfiguring out what went wrong.\n\n465\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.800\nAnd so we may actually want\nto reset the system, and\n\n466\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.610\nsites like this can give us\nthat valuable information.\n\n467\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.642\nGoogle can as well, by the way, it's not\njust there It's just that it's usually\n\n468\n00:23:17.642 --> 00:23:20.457\neasier to find it in one place,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n469\n00:23:20.457 --> 00:23:22.911\nWe talked about the fact\nthat passwords are stored,\n\n470\n00:23:22.911 --> 00:23:25.880\nin many different operating systems,\nin one or two key areas.\n\n471\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.689\nWe obviously know, hopefully a lot of\nyou know in Windows they're stored in\n\n472\n00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:32.440\nthe SAMS, in the SAM file,\nas opposed to Sam's Club.\n\n473\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.486\nThey're stored in the SAM file, and\n\n474\n00:23:34.486 --> 00:23:38.650\nthe SAM file is gonna be in the percent\nsystem, or percent variable space.\n\n475\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.956\nMeaning wherever you've installed\nC:/Windows, traditionally\n\n476\n00:23:41.956 --> 00:23:45.955\nSystem32/config/SAM in Windows systems,\nand we mount that in the registry.\n\n477\n00:23:45.955 --> 00:23:46.931\nWe don't normally go find it there,\n\n478\n00:23:46.931 --> 00:23:48.355\nwe're normally gonna find\nit through the registry.\n\n479\n00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:52.697\nWe've mounted it under the H-key LM, the\nH-key local machine, SAM registry hive,\n\n480\n00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:56.043\nand that's where we are often\nprobably familiar with finding it.\n\n481\n00:23:56.043 --> 00:24:00.130\nWe store either LM, LAN MAN, or MTLM,\nMT LAN MAN hash passwords We dump\n\n482\n00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.425\nthose hashes and that's how we decrypt or\nunencrypt the password hashes,\n\n483\n00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:08.177\nmeaning we just simply compare\nthem against the Rainbow Tables,\n\n484\n00:24:08.177 --> 00:24:10.060\ntrying to find the matches.\n\n485\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.500\nAnd so we can go and grab those\nhashes if we know what we're doing.\n\n486\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.815\nAnd again,\nwe talk about cracking those passwords and\n\n487\n00:24:15.815 --> 00:24:17.331\nmaybe making them available to us.\n\n488\n00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.777\nSo we've got to keep that in mind.\n\n489\n00:24:18.777 --> 00:24:22.936\nWhen we think about steganography,\nanother area that often comes into play,\n\n490\n00:24:22.936 --> 00:24:24.800\nwe think about anti-forensics.\n\n491\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.009\nWe're thinking about the ability to go\nin and to hide data, secretly typically,\n\n492\n00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:32.608\nin and among data that seemingly on\nthe surface really has no bearing or\n\n493\n00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:34.261\nlikeness to what we're doing.\n\n494\n00:24:34.261 --> 00:24:37.836\nSo we may take a picture, a text file,\nan audio file, a video file.\n\n495\n00:24:37.836 --> 00:24:39.862\nAll these different what\nwe call cover mediums.\n\n496\n00:24:39.862 --> 00:24:42.860\nFiles that could be used to\nhide data inside of them.\n\n497\n00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.990\nAnd then we fragment\nthe data we want to hide.\n\n498\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.277\nLet's say I wanna take a picture and\nI wanna hide it inside a Word document.\n\n499\n00:24:49.277 --> 00:24:53.913\nI chunk out the picture and break it up,\nnot me but software that does this.\n\n500\n00:24:53.913 --> 00:24:58.787\nAnd then it drops the little fragments of\nthe picture data into the white space or\n\n501\n00:24:58.787 --> 00:25:03.645\nthe slack space on a hard drive or\nareas in the file that are not being used.\n\n502\n00:25:03.645 --> 00:25:08.017\nAnd that, to the naked eye and to the\nviewer, won´t show up as being data that\n\n503\n00:25:08.017 --> 00:25:12.014\nis seemingly random and\ntherefore nonsequitur and doesn't belong.\n\n504\n00:25:12.014 --> 00:25:15.637\nBut we are able to leverage that space,\nuse it to hide our data, and\n\n505\n00:25:15.637 --> 00:25:19.588\nthen just simply use the program later\nto stitch the data back together,\n\n506\n00:25:19.588 --> 00:25:21.428\nby separating the two files out.\n\n507\n00:25:21.428 --> 00:25:24.490\nHey, here's the Word stuff,\nhere's the picture stuff.\n\n508\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.028\nAnd now we put the picture back together,\nand we actually see the picture.\n\n509\n00:25:28.028 --> 00:25:31.630\nAnd I'm gonna walk you through this in an\nupcoming demonstration and show you how to\n\n510\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.710\nlook at a file, see whether there's\nbeen steganography applied.\n\n511\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.290\nMaybe there is, maybe there isn't,\nas we talked about.\n\n512\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.130\nI'll show you how to create\nthe steganographically modified file by\n\n513\n00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.550\ncombining two files together.\n\n514\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.610\nAnd I will show you how to take\nthe steganographically modified file and\n\n515\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.830\nseparate out the two files so that way\nwe could see what was hidden in there.\n\n516\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.297\nBut we have different techniques\nthat are going to be used.\n\n517\n00:25:50.297 --> 00:25:53.030\nWe can use substitution.\n\n518\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.760\nWe can use transformation.\n\n519\n00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.833\nWe can use statistical techniques,\ndistortion based techniques.\n\n520\n00:25:59.833 --> 00:26:04.192\nWe could use cover generation, technical,\nlinguistic, image, audio, video.\n\n521\n00:26:04.192 --> 00:26:08.000\nThere's all these different areas and ways\nthat we can get into, and just give me\n\n522\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.430\njust one second, I will show you a list\nof some of the common techniques.\n\n523\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.777\nYou want to join me here,\nwe just quickly take a look and\n\n524\n00:26:13.777 --> 00:26:16.347\nget a sense of what they are as\nI was rattling them off to you.\n\n525\n00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:19.448\nProbably hard to keep track of all\nthat while I'm randomly saying, look,\n\n526\n00:26:19.448 --> 00:26:21.130\nthere's eight or nine different types.\n\n527\n00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.014\nBut if we're using substitution,\nvery straightforward,\n\n528\n00:26:24.014 --> 00:26:27.914\nwe're substituting redundant parts of\nthe covering medium, the cover object,\n\n529\n00:26:27.914 --> 00:26:31.910\nwhatever it is, the file that we wanna\nput stuff into, with a secret message.\n\n530\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.240\nSo if we use two picture files\nthat are very similar in nature,\n\n531\n00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.850\nwe can then just substitute our\nsecret bits out for the normal bits.\n\n532\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.270\nAnd they may not show up as being secret,\nit may not realize they're there.\n\n533\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.360\nSo it's one way to do this.\n\n534\n00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.970\nWe can use transforms.\n\n535\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.550\nWe embed the secret message and\ntransform spaces of the signal, for\n\n536\n00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.670\ninstance in audio media and-or\nin video transmissions where we\n\n537\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.420\nare embedding it inside the frequency or\nthe carrier signal.\n\n538\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.292\nSo you may not find it unless you know\nto decrypt and look for it there and\n\n539\n00:27:00.292 --> 00:27:01.424\nseparate out the signals.\n\n540\n00:27:01.424 --> 00:27:06.067\nYou see some of this on,\nnot the sci-fi shows, but again like NCIS,\n\n541\n00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:07.960\nsome of the crime dramas.\n\n542\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.930\nWhere they're doing some of that deep\nanalysis and you see all the tools.\n\n543\n00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.681\nThey've got the audio scanners and\nthings like that.\n\n544\n00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:15.901\nSometimes you see that kind of stuff.\n\n545\n00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:18.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you guys want\nto go out and actually try this,\n\n546\n00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:21.052\nyou can go to vulnhub.com,\ndownload the frequency lab.\n\n547\n00:27:21.052 --> 00:27:22.311\n&gt;&gt; That's right [CROSSTALK].\n\n548\n00:27:22.311 --> 00:27:23.431\n&gt;&gt; They have one, it's already there.\n\n549\n00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:24.585\nYou can play with it.\n\n550\n00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:28.190\nYou have to capture the flag\nthat's with inside of an mp3 file.\n\n551\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.653\nVery cool stuff, and it'll help you\nunderstand these properties, or\n\n552\n00:27:30.653 --> 00:27:31.855\nprinciples, a whole lot easier.\n\n553\n00:27:31.855 --> 00:27:33.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a tool called mpStego.\n\n554\n00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.620\nThere's many tools, but\nthere's a tool called mpStego.\n\n555\n00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.930\nI don't remember if they use that one or\nnot.\n\n556\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.710\nBut there's a bunch in there, but MP Stego\nis the tool that you would use to apply\n\n557\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.381\nstegonometry to MP3,\nMP4 files, things like that.\n\n558\n00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:46.090\nThere's White Noise.\n\n559\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.090\nThere's a whole bunch of\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n560\n00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.510\nSo substitution, transformation, right?\n\n561\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.098\nWe've been through that.\n\n562\n00:27:51.098 --> 00:27:55.294\nStatistical, that's just altering\nstatistical properties of the cover\n\n563\n00:27:55.294 --> 00:27:56.170\nobjects.\n\n564\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.422\nAnd as a result, we then can, again, it's\na question really it's substitution game\n\n565\n00:28:00.422 --> 00:28:03.410\nor a shell game,\nwe're modifying bits no matter what we do.\n\n566\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.560\nWe're taking these bits that seem\nto be least significant over here,\n\n567\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.810\nas you can see down below least\nsignificant bit insertion.\n\n568\n00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.280\nWe're taking out bits that we can\nnibble away at, chip away at,\n\n569\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.730\nthat don't seem to have a lot of\nvalue to the actual cover medium.\n\n570\n00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.500\nAnd we're replacing them with the bits\nthat are important to us that\n\n571\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.030\nwe wanna hide.\n\n572\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.603\nThat's really the mechanism, regardless\nof how we get there or what we do.\n\n573\n00:28:20.603 --> 00:28:25.127\nAnd the idea is ultimately that if we do\nthat, we're able to hide our data and\n\n574\n00:28:25.127 --> 00:28:28.872\nthen if we have a roadmap that tells\nus how to go back and find it,\n\n575\n00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:30.940\nwe can separate the two out later.\n\n576\n00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:35.535\nAnd we ultimately are able to\nthen derive whatever it is.\n\n577\n00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:39.075\nThe picture, the message, the secret code,\n\n578\n00:28:39.075 --> 00:28:42.475\nthe account number, whatever we\nmay have hid, whatever it may be.\n\n579\n00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:45.905\nSo we have all these different methods,\nright, distortion, cover generation,\n\n580\n00:28:45.905 --> 00:28:47.183\ntechnical linguistic image.\n\n581\n00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:50.992\nI talked about least significant bits,\nand just the idea behind it.\n\n582\n00:28:50.992 --> 00:28:53.512\nLet's just quickly take a look\nat that since we're here.\n\n583\n00:28:53.512 --> 00:28:57.288\nCalled LSB as a mechanism for\ninsertion, least significant bit,\n\n584\n00:28:57.288 --> 00:29:01.480\nthe right-most bit of a pixel is called\nthe LSB or least significant bit.\n\n585\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.956\nThe binary data is broken up\nof the hidden message and\n\n586\n00:29:04.956 --> 00:29:08.517\ninserted into the LSB of each\npixel in the image file.\n\n587\n00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:11.401\nThis is kinda cool, we're literally\ngoing pixel by pixel in the image.\n\n588\n00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:14.430\nAnd imagine just close your eyes for\na second.\n\n589\n00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.830\nEnvision the screen you're\nlooking at right now.\n\n590\n00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.360\nFreeze that, take a screen capture of it,\nthat's a picture, right.\n\n591\n00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.602\nThere's hundreds, thousands in this\ncase probably tens of millions of pixels\n\n592\n00:29:24.602 --> 00:29:26.641\nthat make up the colors on the screen.\n\n593\n00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:29.370\nWell, it's so dark it's probably\nlike two pixels white and black.\n\n594\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:29.945\nBut you get the idea.\n\n595\n00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:33.248\nWe got a whole bunch of pixels that\nwill make up this color array,\n\n596\n00:29:33.248 --> 00:29:36.622\nright, that gives us the color\non the screen you're looking at.\n\n597\n00:29:36.622 --> 00:29:40.728\nThis is high def, if you're looking\nat this in 4K, you'd have literally\n\n598\n00:29:40.728 --> 00:29:45.320\nmaybe 16.7, 17 million or\nmore pixels that make up the color array.\n\n599\n00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.389\nWe can carve out of those pixels the least\nsignificant bit, and hide millions of\n\n600\n00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:53.279\nindividual pieces of information inside\nof there without ever modifying or\n\n601\n00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.690\ndistorting in any way the image\nyou're looking at right now.\n\n602\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.322\nBecause that least significant bit doesn't\nrepresent any information of value that\n\n603\n00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:02.920\ndisplays content on the screen\nto create the picture.\n\n604\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.766\nIt's essentially just filler material\nthat's there as part of the structure of\n\n605\n00:30:06.766 --> 00:30:07.621\nthe actual file.\n\n606\n00:30:07.621 --> 00:30:12.217\nBut by doing that, we can actually carve\nout a significant amount of space to be\n\n607\n00:30:12.217 --> 00:30:13.950\nable to use to hide our data.\n\n608\n00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.570\nSteganographically be able to modify it.\n\n609\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.200\nThere's no notable difference\nwhen modifying used,\n\n610\n00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.000\nthe LSBs in order to hide the data.\n\n611\n00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.050\nAnd because of that,\n\n612\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.780\nwe can simply go back and stitch them\ntogether by pulling them back out again,\n\n613\n00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.790\nas long as we know what the sequence\nwas that we modified the bits in.\n\n614\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.180\nThere's different tools to\ndo this differently, but\n\n615\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.740\nultimately whether you do every bit,\nevery other bit, that kind of thing,\n\n616\n00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.150\nyou just have the appropriate\ninformation in the tool.\n\n617\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.883\nUse the same tool to put it in and\nto take it out, and\n\n618\n00:30:38.883 --> 00:30:40.980\nas a result just reverse the process.\n\n619\n00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.650\nThe tool knows what you did.\n\n620\n00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.964\nAnd out comes the file, right?\n\n621\n00:30:43.964 --> 00:30:45.630\nSo it's actually a pretty\ncool little thing.\n\n622\n00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.884\nWe can do masking and filtering which\nis used traditionally on grayscale,\n\n623\n00:30:49.884 --> 00:30:51.309\nas you can see, images.\n\n624\n00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:55.497\nSo it's not used necessarily as often,\ncuz most images are not grayscale, but\n\n625\n00:30:55.497 --> 00:30:56.310\na lot are.\n\n626\n00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.446\nAnd the masking technique hides data in\nsomething like a watermark style, right?.\n\n627\n00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:04.500\nWith gray images, you've got shades,\nright, literally shades of gray, right?\n\n628\n00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.510\nSo we can create watermarks\nthat are lighter or darker, and\n\n629\n00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.180\nthat's the concept of the watermark.\n\n630\n00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.574\nSame thing with data, we hide the\ninformation in such a way that the hidden\n\n631\n00:31:12.574 --> 00:31:14.842\nmessage is inside the visible\npart of the image.\n\n632\n00:31:14.842 --> 00:31:17.170\nNot the other part that's around it.\n\n633\n00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.002\nSo imagine looking at this right now,\n\n634\n00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:22.509\nbecause the Notepad is great example\nof essentially a grayscale image.\n\n635\n00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:26.775\nIt's black or white and there's gray\nin theory, right, between those two.\n\n636\n00:31:26.775 --> 00:31:29.509\nIf I was to hide information\ninside of an image here,\n\n637\n00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:32.679\nlet's just say I took the areas\nwhere we have the black text,\n\n638\n00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:35.056\nI'd be hiding bits of\ninformation in there.\n\n639\n00:31:35.056 --> 00:31:38.587\nAnd if I hid them behind it, literally you\nwouldn't see them because they're lighter,\n\n640\n00:31:38.587 --> 00:31:40.675\nthey're there,\nthey're just one bit out of many.\n\n641\n00:31:40.675 --> 00:31:41.795\nAnd you're not gonna see it.\n\n642\n00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:42.585\nBut then I can reach in and\n\n643\n00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:45.780\nstitch those bits back together,\ncreating the actual words.\n\n644\n00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.260\nAnd that's what we're doing here, right?\n\n645\n00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.257\nSo we're using all these\ndifferent techniques.\n\n646\n00:31:49.257 --> 00:31:53.520\nWe can use audio signals, carrier\nsignals as well, as I mentioned to you,\n\n647\n00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.954\nto hide information in.\n\n648\n00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:58.104\nFrequencies that are inaudible\nto the human ear Can be used\n\n649\n00:31:58.104 --> 00:31:59.846\nto actually hide information.\n\n650\n00:31:59.846 --> 00:32:01.632\nIt'll be right there in the carrier wave.\n\n651\n00:32:01.632 --> 00:32:05.710\nIf you use an analyzer you'll pick it\nup and see it represented as you know,\n\n652\n00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.380\nfluttering on the screen.\n\n653\n00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.730\nWe could record it, we could examine it.\n\n654\n00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.290\nBut we wouldn't be able\nto hear it natively.\n\n655\n00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.690\nWe would be talking and\nthere may be a carrier tone that's being\n\n656\n00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.230\nsent underneath this\nsignal that's got data.\n\n657\n00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.150\nMaybe it's an SOS, right, just literally.\n\n658\n00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.640\nBut we would not hear it.\n\n659\n00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.989\nAnd as a result, we wouldn't know.\n\n660\n00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:23.605\nNow, dogs around us\nare probably going nuts.\n\n661\n00:32:23.605 --> 00:32:24.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Running in circles,\n\n662\n00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.780\nclimbing on the walls.\n\n663\n00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.595\n&gt;&gt; What's wrong, girl?\n\n664\n00:32:26.595 --> 00:32:28.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lassie, what's going on, right?\n\n665\n00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.750\nWhere?\nIn the mines?\n\n666\n00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.855\n&gt;&gt; Timmy fell down a well?\n\n667\n00:32:32.855 --> 00:32:34.965\n&gt;&gt; So, you know, this is the kind\nof thing that happens, right?\n\n668\n00:32:34.965 --> 00:32:37.435\nLiterally, you'll see this\nin the plot of some movies,\n\n669\n00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:40.685\nwhere they've been broadcasting\nsomething in the carrier wave,\n\n670\n00:32:40.685 --> 00:32:42.455\nor over the air, but you can't hear it.\n\n671\n00:32:42.455 --> 00:32:45.705\nBut yet it's picked up on, and that's\nthe signal to go, you know, do whatever,\n\n672\n00:32:45.705 --> 00:32:46.365\nthat kind of thing.\n\n673\n00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:47.655\nSo, we may be doing that.\n\n674\n00:32:47.655 --> 00:32:51.395\nAnd we can be using the spectrum of sound,\nand frequency,\n\n675\n00:32:51.395 --> 00:32:52.585\nto be doing a variety of things.\n\n676\n00:32:52.585 --> 00:32:56.675\nYou'll see we have spread\nspectrum capabilities with DSSS,\n\n677\n00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.440\nDSSS, yes, all three.\n\n678\n00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.580\nDirect Sequence Spread Spectrum.\n\n679\n00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.585\nAlso FHSS, Frequency Hopping Spread\nSpectrum, where we can go ahead and\n\n680\n00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:11.420\nalter the frequency of the audio files,\nso that way, when they're hopping and\n\n681\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.580\nmoving, we're changing and\nshifting with them, and we can hide data.\n\n682\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.520\nAs a result of this we just have to have\nthe receiver being able to pick up on\n\n683\n00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.980\nthis frequency and as a result if\nit picks up on the right hops and\n\n684\n00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.910\nthe right frequency shifts,\nwe could decode the data.\n\n685\n00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.850\nSo this is old school stuff in\nsome respects but is done and\n\n686\n00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.660\nallows us to hide data.\n\n687\n00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.930\nWe may have the LSB coding,\nthe tone insertion, phase decoding,\n\n688\n00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.700\nthere's different ways that we can do this\nwhere we're encoding secret messages,\n\n689\n00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.870\nas phase shifts in the spectrum\nof a digital signal.\n\n690\n00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.710\nWe're doing it as tones as I mentioned,\nlow power tones.\n\n691\n00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.260\nWe're doing least significant bits\nwith the sampling points of the binary\n\n692\n00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.635\ncode in the audio files.\n\n693\n00:33:49.635 --> 00:33:51.190\nThere's all these ways we could do this.\n\n694\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.870\nWe could do this with video as well,\nwhere we hide secret information in\n\n695\n00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.260\nthe manipulation of the video signal,\nright is used to add secret data or\n\n696\n00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.850\nmodify secret data where we can go in and\nuse transforms.\n\n697\n00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.350\nEssentially modify the information\nthe way it is being stored and shown.\n\n698\n00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.540\nSo there is all the mechanisms\nthat allow us to do this.\n\n699\n00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.905\nIt is actually a really\ninteresting area but\n\n700\n00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:14.580\nthere's issues that we\nhave to consider here.\n\n701\n00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.720\nIf you want join me here for\njust a moment i'll just scroll up here.\n\n702\n00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.660\nSo, we can get this right, here.\n\n703\n00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.610\nAnd, so, the idea is,\ncan we go back full screen for a minute?\n\n704\n00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:22.920\nSo, we can see there, there we go, right.\n\n705\n00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.610\nSo, you could see that when we do issues\nthat we have to think about and consider.\n\n706\n00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.030\nWe have to, first and foremost,\nthink about levels of visibility, right.\n\n707\n00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.310\nSo, we're thinking about\nthe fact that it may be hard for\n\n708\n00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.430\nus to see the embedded image.\n\n709\n00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:36.210\nAnd, that's what the hacker wants.\n\n710\n00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.390\nThey want to hide the data.\n\n711\n00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.240\nBut, the problem is,\nif we go too far into the hey,\n\n712\n00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.360\nlet me carve off all off all those pixels,\nwe're gonna actually have a problem\n\n713\n00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.630\nbecause what we're gonna find\nis we distort the image.\n\n714\n00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.350\nAnd as a result, the actual cover media\nno longer is gonna be legitimate.\n\n715\n00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.250\nSo for instance, let's just take\na look at one quick thing here.\n\n716\n00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.480\nLet's go back here.\n\n717\n00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.980\nHypothetically, right,\nlet's just click here for a second and\n\n718\n00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.860\nsee if we can grab an image.\n\n719\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.540\nRight so imagine for just a minute,\nthat we're looking at this image and\n\n720\n00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.700\nthis is hard to see cuz on our screen,\nI know you can't see this, but\n\n721\n00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.538\nthere's a globe that's actually running\nright around and is orbiting in real time.\n\n722\n00:35:12.538 --> 00:35:15.145\nIt's kind of animated right\nbehind the scenes here.\n\n723\n00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:18.125\nIf I hit data on this screen\nsomewhere is an image,\n\n724\n00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:19.565\nbe almost impossible to find, it's dark.\n\n725\n00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:21.065\n&gt;&gt; I'd have a very difficult time, yeah.\n\n726\n00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:22.405\n&gt;&gt; You can't even see\nwhat's on there can you?\n\n727\n00:35:22.405 --> 00:35:23.715\n&gt;&gt; No I can't.\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea what's on there.\n\n728\n00:35:23.715 --> 00:35:24.665\nI know we did something.\n\n729\n00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:25.815\nI have no idea what it is.\n\n730\n00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:27.346\nSo it'd be very tough to find right?\n\n731\n00:35:27.346 --> 00:35:30.292\nBut, the idea is that if\nI modify the image, and\n\n732\n00:35:30.292 --> 00:35:35.304\nif you remember we did this demo where I\nbrought up the embedded image, recovered\n\n733\n00:35:35.304 --> 00:35:40.117\nthe black [CROSSTALK] the black Twitter\ndove or whatever the icon was, right?\n\n734\n00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:42.950\nAnd we brought it up against the black\nbackground, and we couldn't see it.\n\n735\n00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.950\nAnd then, I said, okay, wait,\nlet me open it in Paint.\n\n736\n00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:45.600\nAnd sure enough, boom!\n\n737\n00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.530\nIt comes out because it's\non a white background.\n\n738\n00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.510\nIt's literally that stark, right?\n\n739\n00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.660\nAnd so, we get to a tipping point where,\nif we are hiding data, and for instance,\n\n740\n00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.280\nlike this, where I know you may be able\nto see the edge of the animated globe.\n\n741\n00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.170\nIt is back there,\nit's kind of orbiting right here.\n\n742\n00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.350\nYou can see this little white\nflash that´s coming up.\n\n743\n00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:01.865\n&gt;&gt; Vaguely see it.\n\n744\n00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:02.780\n&gt;&gt; There's data point back there.\n\n745\n00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.590\nSo it's there.\n\n746\n00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.770\nBut imagine,\nyou could kind of not really tell, right?\n\n747\n00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.520\nWhich is why it shows this.\n\n748\n00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.090\nBecause it's so\ndark it's really hard to see what's there.\n\n749\n00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.146\nBut if I did it in such a way that I\ncarved out so many of the pixels that\n\n750\n00:36:13.146 --> 00:36:17.970\nthere was almost no cover media left,\nliterally, no supporting element.\n\n751\n00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.670\nWe get stark white on black and\nwe see the exposed data, or\n\n752\n00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.390\nwe exposed the data that's underneath.\n\n753\n00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.640\nSo it's literally this idea of\nunderstanding that there is a certain\n\n754\n00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.720\namount of elements that\nwe can carve out and\n\n755\n00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.090\nthere's a certain amount\nthat has to be left alone.\n\n756\n00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:35.705\nIf we take too much of the covering\nmedia and carve it away in order\n\n757\n00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:38.725\nto hide our data, we actually wind up\nexposing the data literally [INAUDIBLE].\n\n758\n00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:42.635\nYou'll bring the image up and all of\na sudden the cover media disappears and\n\n759\n00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:45.525\nliterally you're left with something like\nthis secret message embedded inside of it.\n\n760\n00:36:45.525 --> 00:36:47.217\nCuz you just, you took away too much.\n\n761\n00:36:47.217 --> 00:36:48.117\nRight?\nThat could be-\n\n762\n00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:49.547\n&gt;&gt; A little too greedy when you came\n\n763\n00:36:49.547 --> 00:36:51.637\nto the-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you just weren't thinking right.\n\n764\n00:36:51.637 --> 00:36:55.897\nI mean, one of the problems is you use\nthese automated tools and that's perfectly\n\n765\n00:36:55.897 --> 00:36:59.450\nfine as long as you don't mess around\nwith some of the preset settings, or\n\n766\n00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.240\nyou know when you mess around with\nthem what the outcome will be.\n\n767\n00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.610\nBut we have to keep in mind that\nlevels of visibility are important.\n\n768\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.020\nYou may have seen this in some tools\nwhere you can do the lighter or\n\n769\n00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.420\ndarker slider right, so\nit makes it darker or lighter.\n\n770\n00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.260\nIf you get too light, you lose some.\n\n771\n00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.090\nIf you get too dark you\nmay lose something else.\n\n772\n00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.660\nWe've got to be somewhere in the middle\nwhere there's enough coverage that we're\n\n773\n00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.860\nnot actually exposing\nthe underlying secret media, but\n\n774\n00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.310\nwe're leaving enough behind.\n\n775\n00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:26.320\nWe have to think about also file format\ndependency which was on my list as well.\n\n776\n00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.880\nLossy versus lossless compression and\nthe idea of being able to go in and\n\n777\n00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.950\nthink about, and this is with\nthe image and sound files both.\n\n778\n00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.100\nWe gotta understand that.\n\n779\n00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.370\nBut the idea is that here,\nas we compress data, compress signals,\n\n780\n00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.860\nwe may lose the integrity of the data and\nlose what the data means and\n\n781\n00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.730\nhow it's structured,\ndepending on the format we use.\n\n782\n00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.780\nSo, lossless versus lossy.\n\n783\n00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.290\nLossy compression, when we do compression\n\n784\n00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:54.540\nreduces file size because it permanently\neliminates certain kinds of information.\n\n785\n00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.080\nAnd when we do that especially\nredundant information.\n\n786\n00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.670\nSo think of it like deduping, right?\n\n787\n00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're deduping the redundant data.\n\n788\n00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.460\nEven though the user may not notice it,\nwe remove it.\n\n789\n00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.550\nSo that's fine.\n\n790\n00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.630\nJPEGs do this, for instance,\nas an example, right?\n\n791\n00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.870\nSo that's fine.\n\n792\n00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.520\nBut the problem is is the result.\n\n793\n00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.910\nWe don't maintain data integrity.\n\n794\n00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.820\nAnd when we don't maintain data integrity,\nwe may have a problem\n\n795\n00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.640\nwith reproducing the data if we carve\naway, or again, remove too much.\n\n796\n00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.900\nThis is what lossy compression may do.\n\n797\n00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.330\nIt's fine when you're using\na standard JPEG file.\n\n798\n00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.400\nAnd you're using it with tools that\nunderstand how to do it without carving\n\n799\n00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.850\nout important bits of the file\nthat will render a landscape, and\n\n800\n00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.640\nthen the horse that was supposed\nto be there is gone, right?\n\n801\n00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.640\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n802\n00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.720\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n803\n00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.560\nBut the least significant bits\naround the horse may disappear.\n\n804\n00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.890\nAnd so the integrity of the image file\ncould be modified already, and is indeed\n\n805\n00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.690\nmodified already by the compression value,\nor the loss decompression type.\n\n806\n00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:48.590\nWhen you then start tinkering with it\nfarther, applying stenography to it,\n\n807\n00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.250\nyou tip the balance and\ncan actually mess up the image.\n\n808\n00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.840\nAnd it may not render the right way.\n\n809\n00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.810\nSo lossless compression retains\nthe values during compression and\n\n810\n00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.520\nactually does retain the integrity better.\n\n811\n00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.300\nWe do reduce the file size overall, but we\ndo maintain the integrity a little better.\n\n812\n00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.279\nSo there are different ways to do this.\n\n813\n00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.490\nWhen we are going between lossless and\nlossy, we have to keep in mind that if we\n\n814\n00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:16.960\nconvert from lossless or we convert\nlossless information into a lossy format.\n\n815\n00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.190\nSo, you take a file that's been lossless,\ncompressed meaning don't lose anything.\n\n816\n00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.570\nRight?\nThink about the logic.\n\n817\n00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.170\nAnd we convert it into\na lossy compression medium.\n\n818\n00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.400\nWe lose information, and\nwe can render the information unreadable.\n\n819\n00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.000\nThis is one of the ways that we may damage\nfiles during an investigation if we're not\n\n820\n00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.690\ncomfortable with or familiar with\nthe difference and we don't understand\n\n821\n00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:41.650\nthat converting a file between file\ntypes can actually lead to compromise or\n\n822\n00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.750\nlead to our inability to\nbe able to use the data.\n\n823\n00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.510\nSo we just have to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n824\n00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.190\nBecause that can actually lead\nto a lot of problems for us.\n\n825\n00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.750\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully after this little\nsession we've gone through here today,\n\n826\n00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.550\nyou're a little more aware of what goes\non when it comes to password attacks and\n\n827\n00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.380\nwhat we can do to help mitigate that.\n\n828\n00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.370\nAnd as well as starting to dip\nour tone to steganography.\n\n829\n00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:07.300\nVery, very interesting, very fun thing\nto learn about and to play around with.\n\n830\n00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.760\nBut I know we have a little more to go on,\nwe've set the foundation,\n\n831\n00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.210\nwe've got a couple of other things to\ntalk about when it comes to that, so.\n\n832\n00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.410\n&gt;&gt; Checking on free attacks.\n\n833\n00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.280\n&gt;&gt; You never know, right?\n\n834\n00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.950\nYou might wanna do those things, so, that\nbeing said, looking at our clock, though,\n\n835\n00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:19.870\nwe are out of time.\n\n836\n00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.680\nSo come back and join us in for\nI think part four so far.\n\n837\n00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.280\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a lot of fun in part\nfour, so come back and see that.\n\n838\n00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.270\n&gt;&gt; Better than part three.\n\n839\n00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.020\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n840\n00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.380\nBlows part three out of the water.\n\n841\n00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.050\nAll right everyone,\nthanks for watching today.\n\n842\n00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.960\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n843\n00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.586\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

00:00:08.913\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:10.661\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:16.632\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:18.705\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.404\ntoday's episode well it more\non CHFI Version 9 series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:24.386\nAnd, joining us yet again,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:26.980\nAdam, good to have you back,\nmy man how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.940\nGlad to be here talking with all\nof you about all of this stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.882\nWhenever we get together to do this,\nit is always fun.\n\n13\n00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:38.150\nWe're gonna continue with that\nthought process right now.\n\n14\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.550\nI thought we'd actually jump in,\ncontinue with part four.\n\n15\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.229\nWhere we left off in part three, we've\nbeen talking about different ways that\n\n16\n00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.809\nsteganography can be applied and\nthe different mechanism and techniques.\n\n17\n00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.700\nAnd I've thrown out some terminology,\nI've talked about pixels a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.310\nI've talked about resolution,\nthings like that.\n\n19\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.802\nBut we haven't really defined those terms\nand you wanna make sure you understand\n\n20\n00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:59.522\nthe working language of this\ntechnology in this technique, so\n\n21\n00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:03.090\nI thought we'd start simply by going in,\nlooking quickly at image terminology.\n\n22\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960\nThen we're gonna turn our\nattention to steganalysis.\n\n23\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.728\nAnd the idea of how we actually discover\nand render the covert messages,\n\n24\n00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:14.890\nthe hidden messages inside of the\nsteganographically modified information.\n\n25\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.784\nAnd the ways we attack\nthe steganographically protected files in\n\n26\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:20.774\norder to divulge their secrets.\n\n27\n00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:22.490\nSo we'll take a turn at that in a minute.\n\n28\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.230\nBut if you join me over here just\nthought we'd throw up some quick\n\n29\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.540\nvocabulary for you.\n\n30\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.730\nShow you some definitions\non image terminology.\n\n31\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.052\nWe have pixel, bit depth, resolution,\nfile format, image file size,\n\n32\n00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:36.760\ncompression, vector and\nraster images as vocabulary terms.\n\n33\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.460\nIf you're planning on preparing for\nthe exam,\n\n34\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.780\nit would probably be a good idea to make\nsure you have a sense of these terms.\n\n35\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.860\nYou could see the definitions\nhere they are in the show notes,\n\n36\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.330\nI encourage you to maybe make some\nflashcards or do whatever it is you may\n\n37\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.920\nwanna do in order to figure out how to\nmake sure you're comfortable with, and\n\n38\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.580\nhave knowledge of these definitions.\n\n39\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.416\nA pixel is a single point in\nthe images we're talking about.\n\n40\n00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.824\nRemember the least significance bit.\n\n41\n00:01:56.824 --> 00:02:00.240\nWe can call that off as part\nof hiding the data bit depth.\n\n42\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.010\nThe number of columns available for\neach pixel.\n\n43\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.340\nThe resolution sharpness and\nclarity of the image how clear it is.\n\n44\n00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.810\nIs it an HD image is it 4K\nimage that kind of thing.\n\n45\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.404\nSo resolution remember can be\nnegatively effected based on the kind\n\n46\n00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:20.955\nof stegenographic mechanism we use,\nor approach that we use.\n\n47\n00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:26.105\nFile formats just the way as we\nencode information, is it a PNG file,\n\n48\n00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:30.227\nis is a JPEG file, is it lost list,\nis it lossy excuse me.\n\n49\n00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.707\nWe talked about compression\ntypes earlier as well.\n\n50\n00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:35.027\nThe image file size just measured\nin bytes how big it is it.\n\n51\n00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:38.067\nWe've talked that and\nour hard drive conversations.\n\n52\n00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.397\nCompression, we talked about that,\nlossy versus lossless.\n\n53\n00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:43.657\nVector versus raster images.\n\n54\n00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:47.217\nVector images as you can see\nare gonna be geometrical or\n\n55\n00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.087\nusing geometric primitives\npoints lines curves,\n\n56\n00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:53.680\netc all based on the mathematics\nthat represent them in the computer.\n\n57\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.120\nThis would be the Tron-like images,\nif you think about that.\n\n58\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.726\nThere's another really cool movie,\nright, Tron?\n\n59\n00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:02.901\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthe first time it was a guy named Perlin,\n\n60\n00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:06.460\nsomething Perlin, it's a strange word.\n\n61\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.507\nNoise is what they called it, that effect,\nthat cool glowing effect that they had on\n\n62\n00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:12.740\nthe discs and stuff like that,\nPerlin noise.\n\n63\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, got it okay.\n\n64\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.286\n&gt;&gt; Just your random, back to the-\n&gt;&gt; So that was, in other words,\n\n65\n00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:19.371\nthe mechanism they used when they were-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah,\n\n66\n00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:20.924\nthey developed that for that movie.\n\n67\n00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Understand that.\nOkay, good.\n\n68\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.805\nNo, I don't have to sneeze.\nThought I had to sneeze, but\n\n69\n00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:24.455\nI don't have to sneeze.\n\n70\n00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:26.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay I thought I was going to you got\n\n71\n00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:26.696\nthat dust coming.\n\n72\n00:03:26.696 --> 00:03:27.542\nI don't know where it's coming from.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just-\n\n73\n00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.678\n&gt;&gt; Just today, for some reason-\n\n74\n00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:29.510\n&gt;&gt; Allergies [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.639\n&gt;&gt; I don't, you know what it must?\n\n76\n00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.410\nInstead of rain falling from the sky,\nit's dust.\n\n77\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.360\n&gt;&gt; It's dust.\n\n78\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Falling from the sky.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.940\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n80\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.082\nMy nose is just overly sensitive today,\n\n81\n00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:39.215\nI guess.\nPerhaps I'm just a little sensitive cuz\n\n82\n00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:41.128\nwe're talking about images.\n&gt;&gt; That's true,\n\n83\n00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.236\nthat's true.\n&gt;&gt; I take that\n\n84\n00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:42.832\nstuff to heart.\nMaybe\n\n85\n00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:43.442\nthat's what it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n86\n00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:43.944\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n87\n00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:46.799\nanyway, raster images, right?\nThe opposite, as we see here,\n\n88\n00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.860\nof vector images.\nData files or structures representing\n\n89\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.782\nrectangular grids of pixels.\nSo we are using a geometric primitive, but\n\n90\n00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:55.600\none only.\nWe're using a rectangle.\n\n91\n00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.730\nWe're not gonna be using all the other\n\n92\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.629\nshapes.\nPoints of color or\n\n93\n00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.116\nsome sort of thought process there.\nColor raster images, you'll see,\n\n94\n00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:07.940\nhave the pixels with eight bits of\ninformation pertaining to each red, green,\n\n95\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.610\nand blue component.\nWe often talk about RGB\n\n96\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.900\nas the color separation errors\nwhen we talk about the pictures.\n\n97\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.720\nAnd so the quality of that image\n\n98\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.480\nis gonna be reliant on or directly\nrelated to the amount of pixels or\n\n99\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.395\nnumber of pixels that\nare going to be used.\n\n100\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.288\nCuz the greater the pixel density,\nthe most likely,\n\n101\n00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:26.290\nultimately the better the quality.\n\n102\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.871\nThe higher the resolution And\nthe less pixellated,\n\n103\n00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.385\nyou hear people say that sometimes,\nan image will be, as we zoom in, or\n\n104\n00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:36.390\nzoom closer to it, and it spreads out,\nwe can obviously maintain that quality.\n\n105\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.630\nSo, just thought it'd be good for\nus to think about image terminology, for\n\n106\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.450\njust a moment.\n\n107\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.100\nDefine some terms for you,\nmake sure you're comfortable with them.\n\n108\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.880\nWanna turn our attention to steganalysis,\nthe idea of how we go through and\n\n109\n00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.380\nactually examine images that may have\nbeen steganographically modified.\n\n110\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.370\nAnd then try to separate the cover image,\n\n111\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.910\nthe image that's being used to hide\nthe steganographically secreted data and\n\n112\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.660\nthe data itself and\ndo that through attacks on steganography.\n\n113\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.960\nHow we go in and try to debunk or\nremove that information and figure it out.\n\n114\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.770\nIf you're familiar with cryptographic\nattacks where we have your chosen\n\n115\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.340\nplaintext, we have ciphertext only,\ncombination attacks, things like that.\n\n116\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.720\nKnown plaintext, known ciphertext.\n\n117\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.340\nSame idea, just put the words stego in\nthere instead of plaintext or ciphertext.\n\n118\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.860\nSo stego only, known stego or known\nmessage, known cover shows in message.\n\n119\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.160\nShows in stego attacks.\n\n120\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.760\nThese are the attack mechanisms\nthat are often going to be used.\n\n121\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.674\nA stego only attack, all we have access\nto is the steganographicly modified\n\n122\n00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:41.790\npicture or image or\nwhatever the carrier cover medium is.\n\n123\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.997\nSo we do not have access to any\ninformation except the stego medium or\n\n124\n00:05:44.997 --> 00:05:46.920\nstego object here for too differently.\n\n125\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.470\nWe are then trying to try any and all\npossible steganographic tools, mechanisms,\n\n126\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.030\napproaches, techniques.\n\n127\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.855\nTo try to break the steganographic\nprotections that the cover medium is\n\n128\n00:05:56.855 --> 00:05:59.350\noffering and\nseparate out the secreted data.\n\n129\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.296\nSo we're literally just starting with an\nobject that we know has been modified but\n\n130\n00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.515\nwe have no idea how,\nunder what circumstances, with what tools.\n\n131\n00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:10.261\nAnd no way to know when we\nseparate it what we expect to see.\n\n132\n00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:13.785\nIs it gonna be a picture, is it\na word document, is it an audio file?\n\n133\n00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:14.437\nWe just don't know.\n\n134\n00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:17.275\nAnd we're then trying to devolve that and\nfigure it out.\n\n135\n00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:19.935\nIt's called a stego only attack.\n\n136\n00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:25.504\nA known stego attack allows the attacker\nemitting these steganalists,\n\n137\n00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:28.483\nthe person whose doing this stegano-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Help me out here.\n\n139\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.038\nThe person whose doing the attack is the\nperson who is the steganalysist, right?\n\n140\n00:06:32.038 --> 00:06:35.443\nThe person in other words who\nis the investigator trying\n\n141\n00:06:35.443 --> 00:06:39.290\nto break the stenography on\nthe particular image in question.\n\n142\n00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.987\nSo when I say the attacker, I don't want\nyou to think though this is the hacker.\n\n143\n00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:48.217\nRight this is somebody who's\na steganographically again, I did it.\n\n144\n00:06:48.217 --> 00:06:49.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was a stego analyst was\n\n145\n00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:51.190\nwhat I'm trying to say.\n\n146\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.373\nSomeone who's, essentially,\nbeen trained to analyze these images and\n\n147\n00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.050\ndebunk them and break them apart.\n\n148\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.841\nBut they're acting in, typically,\nan investigative capacity right so\n\n149\n00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.202\nthey're trying to figure out how\nto separate these images out and\n\n150\n00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:04.990\nshow us what data is hidden there.\n\n151\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.844\nSo the known stego attack the attacker\nknows the steganographic algorithm that\n\n152\n00:07:09.844 --> 00:07:14.128\nwas used as well as having access\nto the original steganography.\n\n153\n00:07:14.128 --> 00:07:14.982\nBased objects,\n\n154\n00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:18.930\nso the original stego object plus\nthe mechanism that was actually used.\n\n155\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.890\nAnd we then can extract hidden\ninformation by reversing the process.\n\n156\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.179\nSo we know we use this tool\nwith this algorithm, and\n\n157\n00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:28.066\nwe have this output right here\nlet's run it backwards, right.\n\n158\n00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.060\nAnd we can then try to devolve it.\n\n159\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.210\nSo when we have that it's usually\na pretty straightforward process.\n\n160\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.290\nAnd I'll demonstrate that because I'll\nhave the moving parts when we do the demo.\n\n161\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.200\nAnd we'll essentially show\nyou the before and after.\n\n162\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.220\nAnd I'll show you the tool we use\nit to manipulate it back and forth.\n\n163\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.809\nAnd we'll create a steganographically\nmodified image we'll break it apart and\n\n164\n00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:47.300\nshow you the cover medium and\nthe data that goes into it.\n\n165\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.355\nWe'll walk you through the logic\nof that as I showed, or\n\n166\n00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:50.900\nrather said in one of the prior episodes.\n\n167\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.385\nThe known message attack.\n\n168\n00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:58.151\nThe message and the stego medium\nare available, and as a result The message\n\n169\n00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:02.160\nwill be the data that we wanna\nsecret inside of the stego medim or\n\n170\n00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.620\nthe cover media.\n\n171\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.815\nSo we have two of the three\nmoving parts or pieces,\n\n172\n00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:09.480\nand what we're doing is always looking to\nsubstitute for the piece we're missing and\n\n173\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.425\nthen try to solve for\nthat if you think about that logically.\n\n174\n00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.898\nKnown cover attack, we have knowledge of\nboth the stego object, the cover object,\n\n175\n00:08:16.898 --> 00:08:18.603\nand the original cover medium.\n\n176\n00:08:18.603 --> 00:08:21.666\nSo we have the original cover medium,\nthe stego object on the back end,\n\n177\n00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:23.820\nwhat we're looking for\nis the hidden media.\n\n178\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.110\nThat's gonna go in there.\n\n179\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.940\nAnd we're gonna solve for that.\n\n180\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.978\nChosen message attack, we are able to\nchoose which kinds of messages we wanna\n\n181\n00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:34.457\ninsert to create output that will\nbe stenographically modified by\n\n182\n00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:38.827\nrunning through a series of these with\ndifferent tools and different cover media.\n\n183\n00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:42.345\nWe can probably eventually try to\nreproduce an object that mirrors the one\n\n184\n00:08:42.345 --> 00:08:45.750\nwe have and then we'll know exactly\nwhat was done and how it was done.\n\n185\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.920\nSo again, we're solving for the missing\npiece of the puzzle that we don't have\n\n186\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.850\naccess to or object information about,\nand shows an stego attack.\n\n187\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.870\nThis is when we know both\nthe stego object, and the tool or\n\n188\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.740\nalgorithm that is used\nto hide the message.\n\n189\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.570\nAgain, we're choosing to know\ncertain pieces of information, or\n\n190\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.660\nwe have them provided to us.\n\n191\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.140\nWe don't choose, but\nwe have access to them, now,\n\n192\n00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.270\nwe're solving in this case for\nthe secret data.\n\n193\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.575\nWe're trying to find the information\nthat was used to secret inside or\n\n194\n00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:11.210\nwas being put away and put inside.\n\n195\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.490\nSo again,\nwe wanna think about the logic of that and\n\n196\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.370\njust understand how all of that will flow.\n\n197\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.670\nWe do have some standard\nimage file formats,\n\n198\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.820\nI have them up on the screen if you just\nwanna take a look for a minute again.\n\n199\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.530\nThey're in the notes, you can take a look.\n\n200\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.390\nJust thought it was good to add some\nof that stuff in there for you.\n\n201\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.720\nYou're probably familiar with JPG,\nand maybe with PNGs and TIFFs or GIFs.\n\n202\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.965\nBut you may or may not be familiar with\nsome of the others that are up there.\n\n203\n00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:37.260\nNon-standard formats, Targa,\nscalable vector graphics,\n\n204\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.420\npaintbrush, freehand illustrator,\nPhotoshop.\n\n205\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.030\nThings like that may or\nmay not make sense.\n\n206\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.940\nSo thought it was good just to give\nyou some of those and make sure\n\n207\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.280\nyou were comfortable with them, rounding\nout our conversations around images and\n\n208\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.160\nsome of the stego and\nthe graphic stuff that we've been doing.\n\n209\n00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.730\nWe talked about rootkits earlier as yet\nanother way that attackers looking to take\n\n210\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.550\nadvantage of these antiforensics tools and\ncapabilities may act to hide off of you,\n\n211\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.700\nto escape, to take over,\nto control and to manipulate systems.\n\n212\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.917\nDaniel told us that rootkits\nare a favorite tool of his.\n\n213\n00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:10.109\nAnd he does enjoy giving them as\nChristmas presents, so look out for\n\n214\n00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:14.170\nthose electronic devices that mysteriously\nshow up on your door coming from him.\n\n215\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.590\n&gt;&gt; Just plug that into your computer,\nthat's all you need to do.\n\n216\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.940\n&gt;&gt; And then, walk away, don't look back.\n\n217\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.590\nSo rootkits are gonna be very,\nvery problematic, to say the least.\n\n218\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.290\nThey’re nasty pieces of malware and\nthey can cause significant harm and\n\n219\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.210\nproblems for us long term,\nbecause they will burrow so\n\n220\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.912\ndeeply, typically that short of literally\nzeroing out the system and starting over.\n\n221\n00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:38.390\nIt's gonna be almost impossible\nto get rid of these sometimes.\n\n222\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.720\nWe do have some rootkit detection\ntechniques that we wanna think about, or\n\n223\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.100\nat least just wanna be aware of,\nwe may wanna take note of, or\n\n224\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.190\njust think in our minds, how can we deal\nwith a rootkit if somebody is using one.\n\n225\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.265\nSignature based,\nthink traditional malware, AB engines,\n\n226\n00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:55.573\nwe have signatures, we look for\nevidence in the malware, look for\n\n227\n00:10:55.573 --> 00:10:59.254\nevidence of the rootkit based on files\nthat are there, good but limited.\n\n228\n00:10:59.254 --> 00:11:02.365\nBecause if the signature's not up to date\nthen we're not gonna find the malware,\n\n229\n00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:05.490\nwe're not gonna find the rootkit even\nthough it may be staring us in the face.\n\n230\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.050\nWe're just not gonna know it's there, so\n\n231\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.870\nthat's a problem because it may not\nbe as accurate as it needs to be.\n\n232\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.860\nWe may have heuristic or\n\n233\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.770\nbehavior based scanning where we\nlook at things that are going on and\n\n234\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.650\nthe longer we run these systems and\nthese scanners, the smarter they become.\n\n235\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.350\nSometimes they're referred to\nas artificially intelligent.\n\n236\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.550\nBecause they learn and they start with a\nbaseline assumption of nothing is good and\n\n237\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.760\nthey start to learn what the behavior and\nthe baselines are in the system.\n\n238\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.790\nAnd they are programmed and told this\nis acceptable, you'll see task manager\n\n239\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.101\nrunning these processes normally and\nso these 100 are good.\n\n240\n00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:38.835\nWe start seeing that he was not on that\nlist from a behavioral standpoint.\n\n241\n00:11:38.835 --> 00:11:42.958\nWe start to question those and that\nmay lead to red flags and as a result,\n\n242\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.628\nthe potential exposure of system\nprocesses that are running.\n\n243\n00:11:46.628 --> 00:11:47.915\nBut remember, rootkits are smart.\n\n244\n00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:51.545\nThey're gonna borrow and they're not\ngonna expose themselves necessarily\n\n245\n00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.675\nto many of these common\nstandards scanning techniques.\n\n246\n00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:56.881\nSo it may be hard to find,\nwe can use integrity-based scans or\n\n247\n00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:58.740\nintegrity-based capabilities.\n\n248\n00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.015\nWhere we're looking at file signatures and\nif files were modified, or\n\n249\n00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:04.974\nplaced into a directory when\nthey normally wouldn't be there.\n\n250\n00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.236\nOr an older or\nnewer version is swapped out, or\n\n251\n00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:09.750\nsomehow modified on\nthe digital signatures.\n\n252\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:14.540\nOr the integrity mechanism, the hash,\ndoes not check out, then we may say, look,\n\n253\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.050\nthat's suspicious.\n\n254\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.940\nAnd maybe there's evidence of\nsome sort of wrongdoing there.\n\n255\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.900\nIn one of the earlier shows, I showed\nyou Sigverif as a verification tool in\n\n256\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:29.230\nWindows, which is essentially this\nprocess just running on demand for you.\n\n257\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.900\nAnd it's that idea that we use.\n\n258\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.050\nAgain, can be good, but the problem is, if\nwe don't have a complete set of hashes and\n\n259\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.620\nsignatures to verify against, we're\nonly able to look at files that we can\n\n260\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.370\nauthoritatively say we have knowledge of.\n\n261\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.880\nAnd if files that are manipulated and\nmodified are outside of that list,\n\n262\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.370\nwe'd have no way of knowing\nwhether they're good or bad.\n\n263\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.800\nSo it may not be very effective.\n\n264\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.080\nThat's one of the problems.\n\n265\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.420\nRuntime execution path profiling.\n\n266\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.410\nWe can look at runtime execution.\n\n267\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.040\nAnd what path we're executing from.\n\n268\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.560\nAnd where we are.\n\n269\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.310\nAnd as a result we may be able\nto tell things about files.\n\n270\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.100\nAnd about the executables and\nthe calls that are made that may stand out\n\n271\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.830\nbehind the background or\naround the background of the stuff.\n\n272\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.350\nThis, again, takes time because we have to\nlearn what is normal in the system which\n\n273\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.420\nshould be there, but this may get\nus deeper into the system if we can\n\n274\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.610\nlook at system calls below\nthe graphical level.\n\n275\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.070\nMay be able to see things that\nwe would normally to see.\n\n276\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.500\nCross view based.\n\n277\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.470\nThis allows us to assume that\nfunctionality in the OS has been modified\n\n278\n00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.460\nor destructed in some way by the malware\nor by the suspected malware,\n\n279\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.580\nwhatever it may be.\n\n280\n00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.673\nAnd we rely upon the fact\nthat API hooking, or\n\n281\n00:13:30.673 --> 00:13:35.480\nmanipulation of kernel data structures,\nwhich is often done by rootkits.\n\n282\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.510\nYou probably speak a lot to this, cuz I\nknow this is something you are passionate\n\n283\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.180\nabout or familiar with API rootkits\nmanipulating APIS, kernel root kit.\n\n284\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.727\nKernel root kit.\n\n285\n00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:45.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it again.\n\n286\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.920\nManipulation of kernel data\nstructures through API hooking.\n\n287\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.390\nThat's something you've talked about\nwith me on occasion where you've done\n\n288\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.470\nsome of your stuff, manipulated\nsystem calls, things like that.\n\n289\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.130\nYou have that kinda behavior.\n\n290\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.480\nWe can look for evidence of that.\n\n291\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.140\nAnd when that happens, there's very\nfew reasons why that would occur and\n\n292\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.480\nnormally, the reasons that this kinda\nstuff does occur for is usually bad.\n\n293\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; More often than not.\n\n294\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.310\nSo if we can look for evidence of\nAPIs being accessed and being hooked,\n\n295\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.670\nbeing used when we say they're being\nhooked, essentially, they're being used.\n\n296\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.164\nIf we see evidence of this or manipulation\nof kernel data structures, as in the OS\n\n297\n00:14:19.164 --> 00:14:23.591\nkernel, in a way that are not normally\nbe allowed, or should not be allowed, or\n\n298\n00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:28.151\nare not part of what we'd expect as normal\nbehavior, we are seeing the mirrored or\n\n299\n00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:33.360\nessentially the reflective evidence of\nmalware, most like a rootkit's operating.\n\n300\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.780\nThat’s one of the hidden tell-tale\nsigns that often trip these things up.\n\n301\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.870\nSo some of the newer techniques are using\nthings like cross view based scanning,\n\n302\n00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:45.700\nwhere we’re looking at system calls and\nprocesses and API access and\n\n303\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.390\nthings that don’t seem obvious and don’t\nseem like they belong, are questioned.\n\n304\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:56.580\nAnd if we find random and\nor non sequitur access,\n\n305\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.670\nwe may start tracking that back, looking\nfor evidences, the things that are hiding\n\n306\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.860\nbehind the scenes pulling those strings,\na lot of the time it is malware.\n\n307\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.960\nA low level mechanisms use to output\nthe same information over, and over again.\n\n308\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.560\nAnd the system calls may\nlead to evidence of rootkit.\n\n309\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.680\nSo it's interesting,\n\n310\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.190\nthat's one of the areas that we may\nactually find this happening in.\n\n311\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.680\nWho would've thought 10, 15, 20 years ago,\nwe'd be looking at API calls to find\n\n312\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.980\nmalware, but that's actually a fairly\ncommon thought process today.\n\n313\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.650\nSo it is something just to be aware of and\nto think about.\n\n314\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.950\nThink about also, things like live\nboot CDs, and bootable USB devices.\n\n315\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.830\nWe talked about VMs already, virtual\nmachines, how these things may be used\n\n316\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.970\nto hide access to the activities that\na hacker is engaging in cuz again,\n\n317\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.650\nif I insert a live boot USB,\nI mean literally, something like this.\n\n318\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.240\nIf I put this into the machine, boot\nthe OS that I wanna use off of this and\n\n319\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.500\nI run it on a frame piece of hardware\nthat's really irrelevant cuz it\n\n320\n00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.450\ndoesn't matter what it is, I'm not gonna\nleave behind the evidence of what I do.\n\n321\n00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.948\nIt's all gonna be stored here.\n\n322\n00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:55.897\nThen, the way out is I\nwalk away with this and\n\n323\n00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:59.587\nunless the forensic investigator gets\naccess to that drive, there's no evidence\n\n324\n00:15:59.587 --> 00:16:02.980\nof what I do in the host Because this\nmachine's hard drive is not being used.\n\n325\n00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.960\nI'm using an external hard drive.\n\n326\n00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.560\nThink about that.\n\n327\n00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.660\nSo things like Windows To Go, which is\ntechnology that's been around now for\n\n328\n00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.860\na few generations, we can literally setup\nWindows and run it off of a bootable\n\n329\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.150\nexternal USB device or bootable\nrescue CDs like live boot CDs like,\n\n330\n00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.650\nfor instance, Knoppix or whatever\nthe case may be on the Linux side.\n\n331\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.680\nWe can do that.\n\n332\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.700\nWe're running that operating system.\n\n333\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.100\nWe're running it from a nonstandard way.\n\n334\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.680\nAgain, that would be an opportunity to\nload tools and to use a normal system and\n\n335\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.350\nto turn it into an attack platform and\nthen just simply walk away and\n\n336\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.100\nput it back to normal as\nif nothing was ever done.\n\n337\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.760\nWill be very tough to find evidence\nof that, and to understand that.\n\n338\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.580\nAnd that, again, could be something that\nwould be important for us to be aware of.\n\n339\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.580\nWhat are some of the counter measures\nassociated with these approaches?\n\n340\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.670\nWe talked a lot about these things,\nand what they are.\n\n341\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.000\nBut if you think logically about how do we\nstop them, or how do we recognize them,\n\n342\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.400\nperhaps prevent them?\n\n343\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.560\nTraining and education in terms of\nforensically sound approaches and\n\n344\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.480\nhow we deal with this knowledge and\nwhat it stands out and\n\n345\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.940\nlooks like when it's not\na forensically sound approach.\n\n346\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.175\nIt's anti-forensics.\n\n347\n00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:07.241\nIn other words, training investigators,\ntraining users.\n\n348\n00:17:07.241 --> 00:17:11.105\nSomething like a see something, say\nsomething campaign would be very valuable.\n\n349\n00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:13.695\nWe always wanna try to push\nthe idea of training an education\n\n350\n00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:15.305\nas one of our primary approaches.\n\n351\n00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:19.595\nSpreading that knowledge far and wide\nhelps us to not only enhance our ability\n\n352\n00:17:19.595 --> 00:17:23.840\nto find things that may be going wrong\nbecause multiple eyes are looking.\n\n353\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.020\nBut it also strengthens our ability,\nin terms of our depth\n\n354\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.370\nof our early warning systems so that\nif one person misses the warning sign,\n\n355\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.405\nmaybe somebody else picks it up and\nfinds it.\n\n356\n00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:36.535\nBecause they may see it as being unusual,\nmaybe because they have more knowledge or\n\n357\n00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:38.875\njust because they look at\nit differently who knows.\n\n358\n00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:42.295\nBut the idea would be that we want\nlots and lots of eyes on a problem.\n\n359\n00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:45.315\nValidate the results of examination\nwe talked about using multiple\n\n360\n00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.225\ndifferent tools.\n\n361\n00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:49.865\nDon't rely on just one tool set and say,\nyep, that's definitively what it is.\n\n362\n00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:52.185\nI told you, for instance,\nwhen you're loading images and\n\n363\n00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:54.320\nlooking at them in analysis tools.\n\n364\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.740\nUse more than one, because you may\nfind that images are going to have\n\n365\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.780\nthe same exact data in multiple tools,\n\n366\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.580\nbut some tools may be better at\nfinding certain things than others.\n\n367\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.180\nI showed you the differences around\nthings like creating a memory dump, and\n\n368\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.720\nthe FDK tool, or\nin the NTFS File Explorer tool.\n\n369\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.980\nIt wasn't designed to do that, so\n\n370\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.770\nit wouldn't get access to as\nmuch of the data from the image.\n\n371\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.390\nThe data's there,\n\n372\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.730\nI'm just not seeing it all, cuz\nthe tool's not designed to work that way.\n\n373\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.520\nSo you wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and that we understand that.\n\n374\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.768\nAgain, with the steg and\nthe graphic tools, in particular.\n\n375\n00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:26.922\nCertain tools are designed to capture and\nsee certain kinds of stegnografically\n\n376\n00:18:26.922 --> 00:18:29.975\nmodified images because of\nthe approaches that were used,\n\n377\n00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:33.027\nwhereas other tools may not look for\nthose approaches and so\n\n378\n00:18:33.027 --> 00:18:37.392\nmay be blind to the fact that that image\nhas been stegnographically modified.\n\n379\n00:18:37.392 --> 00:18:39.860\nWe wanna know how to use multiple\ntools to cross reference and\n\n380\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.760\nvalidate our assumptions.\n\n381\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.260\nImpose the use of or\n\n382\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.050\nrather impose rules against the use of\nanti forensics tools in organizations.\n\n383\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.380\nSo that people are not\ntempted to get into trouble.\n\n384\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.175\nThough a lot of the attacks that we\noften see are coming from inside\n\n385\n00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:54.405\nof the security perimeter.\n\n386\n00:18:54.405 --> 00:18:58.116\nWe talked about the insider threat as\nbeing a very big problematic one for us.\n\n387\n00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:00.545\nSo we wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n388\n00:19:00.545 --> 00:19:04.075\nUnderstand the use of these\nanti-forensics tools, as we talked about.\n\n389\n00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:06.095\nUnderstand the weaknesses\nassociated with them.\n\n390\n00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:09.294\nBut the telltale signs\nassociated with them, as well.\n\n391\n00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:12.534\nI wanna go and back to to this idea we\nhad a minute ago of things like external\n\n392\n00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:14.510\nbootable operating systems.\n\n393\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.210\nIt's hard to say this, and\n\n394\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.900\nI understand that just from a culture\nperspective and a reality perspective,\n\n395\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.590\nmost companies cringe when you\nhear us talk about this stuff.\n\n396\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.260\nYou're not gonna do it, but the easiest\nway to deal with this kind of an issue and\n\n397\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.130\nall of the problems it provides,\nit's a very simple solution,\n\n398\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.560\nit blocks access to the USB\nports on a device using a MDM,\n\n399\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.880\na mobile device management platform or\nsome sort of tool.\n\n400\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd you're physically literally just\nblock access by blocking off the ports.\n\n401\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.585\nPut a proxy in them or\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n402\n00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:49.180\nBut if you prevent initialization of\nthe technology, you're preventing the bad\n\n403\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.280\nactors thread vector, the ability for them\nto leverage that technology against you.\n\n404\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.060\nThat may be a radical solution.\n\n405\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.060\nYou may not envision a world where\nUSB devices are not allowed.\n\n406\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.060\nI get that.\n\n407\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.710\nPeople need to plug in and\ncharge their devices cuz, my god,\n\n408\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.230\nwhat would happen if we can't tether?\n\n409\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.975\nBut think about a world\nwhere we don't do that.\n\n410\n00:20:06.975 --> 00:20:10.167\nThink about how much more secure\nwe would be if we weren't allowing\n\n411\n00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.245\nthis kinda behavior to occur unregulated,\nunchallenged, and\n\n412\n00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:17.200\nunmonitored in most of the corporate\nenvironments that we work in today.\n\n413\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.164\nJust think about that kind of a world for\na minute.\n\n414\n00:20:19.164 --> 00:20:21.915\nNow, close your eyes and join hands-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And sing kumbaya.\n\n415\n00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:24.190\n&gt;&gt; And sing kumbaya as we\nwalk off into the sunset.\n\n416\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Coke and a smile.\n\n417\n00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nCoke and a smile.\n\n418\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Just be aware of that.\n\n419\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.120\nBut you now there are solutions to\nthese problems what I'm trying to\n\n420\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.890\nimpress upon you.\n\n421\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.190\nIt may be a radical solution in\nyour world but I have customers and\n\n422\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.630\nI work with clients that actually think\nthat that's perfectly acceptable solution.\n\n423\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.050\nAnd they implement that because\nthe risk-benefit, the cost-benefit risk\n\n424\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.510\nanalysis around letting you plug a device\nin versus hacking into an entire network\n\n425\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.370\nbecause of a hacked device that is\naccessed, there's a no brainer there.\n\n426\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.160\nThey would rather prevent you from using\nstorage mechanisms that are not directly\n\n427\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.300\ncontrolled by the organization then\nallow unknown organizational assets or\n\n428\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.380\nunknown assets to be used to access\norganizational infrastructure\n\n429\n00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.375\nbecause we just don't know\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n430\n00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:10.800\nAnd this is proven every day where people\nwill pick these devices up and, or\n\n431\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.540\njust find them and plug them in\nwithout knowing what's on them.\n\n432\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.310\nThis is one of the ways,\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n433\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.240\nwhere we can infiltrate doing pen\ntesting and things like that.\n\n434\n00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.170\nBecause we'll leave these devices around.\n\n435\n00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.223\nAnd you'll be, shiny objects.\n\n436\n00:21:21.223 --> 00:21:23.077\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What do they say about curiosity?\n\n437\n00:21:23.077 --> 00:21:24.714\nIt kills the American Administrator.\n\n438\n00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:26.379\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nit means I have to find a new job.\n\n439\n00:21:26.379 --> 00:21:27.769\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it says.\n\n440\n00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:30.720\nIt's known as the RGE, cross over event.\n\n441\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.002\nPlug in fun drive and\nupdate resume at the same time.\n\n442\n00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:34.775\nThat is your launch malware.\n\n443\n00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:35.627\nIt's kind of a.\n\n444\n00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.681\n&gt;&gt; You will have a nice new\nfun drive to put it on.\n\n445\n00:21:36.681 --> 00:21:37.252\n&gt;&gt; You do.\nAnd\n\n446\n00:21:37.252 --> 00:21:40.828\nyou can then propagate that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n447\n00:21:40.828 --> 00:21:41.640\n&gt;&gt; That you go to.\n\n448\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.671\nSo think about that, just the idea of\ngoing through the countermeasure thought\n\n449\n00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:49.820\nprocess, and the counteraction thought\nprocess, in terms of things we should be\n\n450\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.500\ndoing, is just to remind you that\nthere are solutions to problems.\n\n451\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.429\nBut we have to be thinking about what\nthe problems are, have clear and\n\n452\n00:21:57.429 --> 00:22:00.017\nreally valuable insight\ninto what they are.\n\n453\n00:22:00.017 --> 00:22:02.449\nAnd framing that conversation\nin the organization so\n\n454\n00:22:02.449 --> 00:22:06.069\nwe could have the conversation with\nsenior leaders, you have the conversation\n\n455\n00:22:06.069 --> 00:22:09.280\nwith peers and colleagues,\npeople we work with and we work for.\n\n456\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.488\nAnd help them to understand that there\nare significant risks that they may not be\n\n457\n00:22:13.488 --> 00:22:15.190\nseeing but\njust doesn't mean they're not there,\n\n458\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.990\njust means they're not aware of them.\n\n459\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.850\nThough most people as I said will not view\nthis device as being anything other than\n\n460\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.350\nsimply what it is,\na thumb drive, nothing more.\n\n461\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.180\nBut the reality is that that can be\nthe difference between your information\n\n462\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.070\nbeing exfiltrated out of your organisation\nby a bad actor or bad stuff being brought\n\n463\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.680\nin with or without your knowledge, and\nthe choice is yours at the end of the day.\n\n464\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.384\nIt sits in your hands, are you gonna allow\nit or are you not, and that's what you\n\n465\n00:22:40.384 --> 00:22:43.979\nhave to decide, not only as a security\nprofessional first and foremost, but\n\n466\n00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:47.713\nthen the outcome of that decision rests\nsquarely with us, the investigators.\n\n467\n00:22:47.713 --> 00:22:51.385\nBecause if we allow access to those\ndevices, I promise you, you're gonna be\n\n468\n00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:54.944\nchasing down a lot of those devices\nlooking for evidence of things that went\n\n469\n00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:58.842\nwrong, because somebody plugged one in\nthat had not been thoroughly scanned, or\n\n470\n00:22:58.842 --> 00:23:01.496\nhad not been controlled properly,\nor for some reason,\n\n471\n00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:05.025\nit was used to be able to infiltrate or\nexfiltrate and carry out an attack.\n\n472\n00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:06.880\nIt's only a matter of time,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n473\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.000\nSo you just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n474\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n475\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:15.010\nNow, you've seen a lot of the ways and\nactivities in which the bad actor or\n\n476\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.340\nthreat actor, or\nwhatever you would like to call them,\n\n477\n00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.240\nmight engage in to stymie us\nas forensic investigators.\n\n478\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.680\nTry to hide what they've done,\ntry to sweep it under the rug so\n\n479\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.680\nthat we don't see it, at least slow us\ndown from finding them maybe to the point\n\n480\n00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.660\nwhere they can slip away into the darkness\nand continue their nefarious activities.\n\n481\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.133\nSo definitely [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Shame on them.\n\n482\n00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:40.230\n&gt;&gt; They are very bad, very bad.\n\n483\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.770\nThat being said, hopefully, you guys got\na lot out of this episode, I know I did.\n\n484\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.400\nI always enjoy looking at\nthese types of things and\n\n485\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.680\ntrying to stand on that side of the fence.\n\n486\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.880\nAnd so,\nthat we can jump back onto our side and-\n\n487\n00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Jump back.\n\n488\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, jump back.\n\n489\n00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.340\nAll right, everyone,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n490\n00:23:55.340 -->

00:00:16.953\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:20.463\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday's exciting episode, well,\n\n8\n00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:22.870\nwe're coming back with\nwith CHFI version nine.\n\n9\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.500\nHopefully that's what\nyou were looking for.\n\n10\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.590\nAnd joining us in the studio, our mentor\nin that endeavor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.780\nAdam, glad to have you back man,\nhow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Firing the forensic guns\nof knowledge at our audience\n\n13\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Spraying them with good information,\nit is going well.\n\n15\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.970\n&gt;&gt; Infowars.\n\n16\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.829\n&gt;&gt; Infowars.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.600\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna jump into a little hands\n\n18\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.610\non demonstration.\n\n19\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.100\nWe have been promising you, I have been\npromising you for several episodes now,\n\n20\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.930\nwe would take a look at how\nto do some password cracking,\n\n21\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.990\nalso a little steganography.\n\n22\n00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.450\nSo we're gonna jump and\ntake a look at that.\n\n23\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.070\nIf you join me over here,\nwhat we will see is we have already, I,\n\n24\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.790\nI should say have already run through\ninitially cracking a Word document.\n\n25\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.210\nJust showing you how to do this.\n\n26\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.232\nWe'll reverse engineer the tools\nwe often do, in just a moment.\n\n27\n00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:03.647\nJust wanna show you the output,\nthen I'll show you how the tool works.\n\n28\n00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:06.380\nBut this is the password recovery,\nforensic kits.\n\n29\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.460\nOne of the toolkits we can\nuse from pass where, so\n\n30\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.900\nwe just have a Word document\nsitting right down here.\n\n31\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.410\nTest document number two, and you could\nsee I ran this and we did brute force it.\n\n32\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.750\nNot very complicated password.\n\n33\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.856\nThree characters, right, T-I-P.\n\n34\n00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:23.690\nSo we could see it there, and so\nwe can see the output of that.\n\n35\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.440\nWe can see the attacks that were run,\nthe password is right there.\n\n36\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.110\nYou could see a little\nlog capability here.\n\n37\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.260\nSo what the tool does, very\nstraightforward, let me just close this.\n\n38\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.380\nAnd we'll just open it back up.\n\n39\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.490\nI've got a little shortcut\nsitting right there.\n\n40\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.590\nSo the tool opens up looks like this.\n\n41\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.850\nWe have our recover file,\npassword option, find encrypted files,\n\n42\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.260\nfull disk encryption.\n\n43\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.300\nYou decrypting different items depending\non what we're doing of course.\n\n44\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.850\nWhoops, depending on what we're doing,\nof course.\n\n45\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.180\nAnd system and registry, extraction,\nyou have all these different options.\n\n46\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.660\nBut we're here to focus on passwords,\nso recover file password, right.\n\n47\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.560\nIf I go down here, and we just find\nour document, whatever it may be.\n\n48\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.500\nOur Excel document, Word document,\nit doesn't really matter,\n\n49\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.470\nwhatever we're using.\n\n50\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.530\nI did the Word document,\nif we do that, we load that up.\n\n51\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.340\nWe can, as you'll see it just goes\nimmediately, and it says okay,\n\n52\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.310\nhey that's what I wanna do,\ncuz I already did that.\n\n53\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.210\nBut I do get an option to specify,\nhow I actually want this to behave.\n\n54\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.550\nSo for instance, let me just go in here,\nlet me clear the history.\n\n55\n00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.570\nLet me go back here,\njust go in and do this real quick.\n\n56\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.090\nAnd let me go in and\nlet me just use, go right here, and\n\n57\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.210\nlet me go in, use the Excel document, same\nthing, I just wanna show you the wizard.\n\n58\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.940\nJust so\nwe can see how the wizard is set up.\n\n59\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.650\nSo, you see the options we have\nin terms of how it cracks, so\n\n60\n00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.480\nI'm just selecting different documents so\nit doesn't see, look, I already did that.\n\n61\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.000\nIt just runs right through to the end.\n\n62\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.740\nYou don't get to see the options here.\n\n63\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.390\nSo I have a little wizard I can run,\nif I want to program in the tool and\n\n64\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.130\nhow it's going to work,\nuse pre-defined settings,\n\n65\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.927\nuses the default attach that\nrecover your password most likely,\n\n66\n00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:03.645\nyou have brute force, dictionary,\nstandard stuff like that.\n\n67\n00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:05.215\nSome advanced customizable settings.\n\n68\n00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:07.515\nThen I could add multiple\nfiles to the run.\n\n69\n00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.215\nSo let's go through instead of doing the,\nhey use the predefined,\n\n70\n00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:11.755\nbecause it just immediately does it.\n\n71\n00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:12.523\nLet's just run the wizard.\n\n72\n00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:15.525\nCuz you could see what the options\nare in a tool like this.\n\n73\n00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:20.225\nSo you'll see here,\nthe password is one dictionary word.\n\n74\n00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.980\nSo it's gonna be like the word the,\nthe word apple,\n\n75\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.000\nthe word dog is something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.800\nRight, more than one dictionary,\nwe're gonna move this a little bit so\n\n77\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.140\nyou could see the edge of the screen here,\nwhile we're talking.\n\n78\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.550\nMore than one dictionary word, one or\n\n79\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.772\nmore dictionary words combined together\nwith numbers and symbols, right?\n\n80\n00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:39.560\nA non-dictionary but\nsimilar to English words.\n\n81\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.630\nOther, I know nothing about the password.\n\n82\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.870\nI have no knowledge of what the password\nmay be, so we have different options here.\n\n83\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.950\nAnd so what we're gonna do is,\n\n84\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.770\nif we say we know nothing, then it's gonna\ngo through and it's gonna do its best.\n\n85\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.250\nAnd notice, by the way up here,\nbrute force fast,\n\n86\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.790\nrainbow table attack is possible, right?\n\n87\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.350\nIf it's one dictionary, right?\n\n88\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.570\nIt's telling us different options\nbased on what I'm doing, and\n\n89\n00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.230\nyou nedd a choices I may make.\n\n90\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.770\nSo, it's saying brute force.\n\n91\n00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.460\nBut I may be able to use\na rainbow table as well.\n\n92\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.510\nJust depending on what I'm doing, right?\n\n93\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.430\nI have different options.\n\n94\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.090\nRemember, this is one tool.\n\n95\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.331\nAll these different tools may\nhave different interfaces, and\n\n96\n00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.330\nlook different ways.\n\n97\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.275\nYou ever used the Cain and Abel?\n\n98\n00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.167\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n99\n00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Or used LophtCrack,\nthings like that before?\n\n100\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The wizard looks different.\n\n101\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.970\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n102\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.710\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like this.\n\n103\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.160\nBut at the end of the day you get to\n\n104\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.780\nthe same place.\n\n105\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.870\nIt's just a question of what you choose\nto do or how you choose to get there.\n\n106\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.940\nSo I'm gonna say,\nit's one dictionary word.\n\n107\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.900\nAll right, great.\n\n108\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.886\nNext, then what dictionary, am I using an\nArabic dictionary, Dutch, English, I have,\n\n109\n00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:37.715\nmulti language support, I've specify what\nthat's gonna look like, we'll do English.\n\n110\n00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:40.275\nThen I have to specify,\nset the password length.\n\n111\n00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:41.395\nHow long will the password be?\n\n112\n00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:45.705\nI'm bracketing it low and high, so\nremember the more digits I put on the high\n\n113\n00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:49.215\nand the longer the cracking will be,\nbecause it has to do multiple generational\n\n114\n00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:54.757\niterations of that to figure it out,\nand is there a known pattern?\n\n115\n00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:59.367\nA known pattern may be, I know\nthe first letter is gonna start with A,\n\n116\n00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:01.597\nthe third letter will be S.\n\n117\n00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:02.887\nRight, I don't know, whatever it is.\n\n118\n00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:06.567\nSo I can put that in with wildcard\ncharacters or separators in between, so\n\n119\n00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:09.927\nit'll eliminate and cut down dramatically\non the number of things I have to do.\n\n120\n00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:12.840\nWe talked about this in terms of\nbracketing one of the conversations.\n\n121\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.040\nSo again, all lower, all upper,\nnormal, toggle casing, mixed casing.\n\n122\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.294\nRight, toggle casing tends to throw\nthings off and make it harder to decrypt,\n\n123\n00:05:21.294 --> 00:05:26.011\nbecause you have to do more searches, more\niterations, try reversed words, right?\n\n124\n00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:29.870\nSo like, pet and tap, right,\nor the and ht or whatever.\n\n125\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.060\nBecause again, we may do that,\nwe may come up with a word list, and\n\n126\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.840\nthen reverse them with software\nthat'll do that inverting the words.\n\n127\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.010\nAnd if you don't know to search for\ninverted words, it takes a lot longer,\n\n128\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.030\nbecause there's no pattern\nyou're searching for.\n\n129\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.030\nYou're randomly trying\nto lock in characters.\n\n130\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.310\nSpeaking of randomly locking characters.\n\n131\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.130\nSo here's one of those things that we\noften talk about movies, talk about TV,\n\n132\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.050\nDaniel and I.\n\n133\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.250\nWe try to relate things to\ncommonalities that you would maybe\n\n134\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.310\nbe more familiar with, right.\n\n135\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.480\nA lot of you have may have seen the movies\nor the TV shows we talk about, and\n\n136\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.730\nif the ideas and the extension\nof our conversation makes sense,\n\n137\n00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.829\nit may be easier for you to understand and\nlatch on to the information.\n\n138\n00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.310\nDo you remember War Games?\n\n139\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.016\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen it tons of times.\n\n140\n00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:07.230\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Great movie,\nMathew Broderick,\n\n141\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.712\nAli Sheedy, both are like ten\nyears old in this movie, right?\n\n142\n00:06:09.712 --> 00:06:11.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you remember War Games, right,\n\n143\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.575\none of the things that often happens in\nmovies and TV we see kernels of truth.\n\n144\n00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.806\nSurrounded by rappers of idiocy,\nand just ludicy, right?\n\n145\n00:06:17.806 --> 00:06:19.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so when you look at War Games,\n\n146\n00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:23.943\nif you remember the very end of the movie,\nright, where they're in Cheyenne Mountain\n\n147\n00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:27.937\nin the control center, the computer has\nessentially taken over whopper right?\n\n148\n00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:30.462\nIt's trying to launch the missiles.\n\n149\n00:06:30.462 --> 00:06:34.342\nAnd so they've got the code up on\nthe screen right, that the hang man right?\n\n150\n00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:36.112\nThey're playing digit match.\n\n151\n00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.232\nAnd instead it's running through,\n\n152\n00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:41.032\nand you see all the characters\nrunning through each one right?\n\n153\n00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:43.572\nAnd it's locking in a character\nlike I don't know every 20\n\n154\n00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:44.472\nseconds whatever it is.\n\n155\n00:06:44.472 --> 00:06:46.212\nAnd the annoying woman character there.\n\n156\n00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.235\nMy God it's got another one,\nmy God, and she's doing that.\n\n157\n00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:51.790\nAnd, I stop and I look and\nsay there's absolutely no way,\n\n158\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.735\nit doesn't work this way.\n\n159\n00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:54.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, if it did this,\n\n160\n00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.680\nright, I mean literally, right in\nfive minutes the world would be gone.\n\n161\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.420\nIt runs through that, but\nthe way this thing works,\n\n162\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.170\nyou gotta match the entire\nstring to get a match, right?\n\n163\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not putting one character in,\n\n164\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.890\nit would solve it in like five seconds.\n\n165\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, if you think about it.\n\n166\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.760\nA through Z, right and zero through nine,\nit would run each one and\n\n167\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.180\ngo okay great I got everything,\nbecause I figured it out.\n\n168\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta match the entire string,\n\n169\n00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.410\nthat's what takes so long.\n\n170\n00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.440\nBut in the movies they don't represent\nthis cuz it's not good theater.\n\n171\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; And it wouldn't be dramatic.\n\n172\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.430\nYeah, we're waiting, and there's nothing.\n\n173\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.750\nWell, we can probably go out,\nand grab dinner, and come back.\n\n174\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.420\nAnd we could probably have kids,\ncuz it would take that long.\n\n175\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.180\nAnd nothing would happen.\n\n176\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.910\nYou would be waiting for 40 years and\nobviously nothing would go wrong.\n\n177\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.860\nSo it's obviously not dramatic, right?\n\n178\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.450\nSo when we do this kind of stuff,\nyou gotta understand,\n\n179\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.700\nit's not necessarily what they represent\nit as in the movies a lot of the times.\n\n180\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.495\nBecause we don't see that, pattern\nmatch happening one block one bite,\n\n181\n00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:47.896\none sector at a time.\n\n182\n00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:52.402\nWe're seeing it happen for the entire\nstring, and if the passwords 25 characters\n\n183\n00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:56.534\nlong like Daniel was saying, we got\na randomly hit that string and get lucky.\n\n184\n00:07:56.534 --> 00:07:59.380\nOr we gotta know what it is and\nprogram it in.\n\n185\n00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.262\nThat's the only way you get a match.\n\n186\n00:08:00.262 --> 00:08:04.453\nSo when you see this stuff, you've\ngot to understand the reality of what\n\n187\n00:08:04.453 --> 00:08:08.318\nit is versus the Hollywood version\nof what we claim it's gonna be.\n\n188\n00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:10.100\nCuz it doesn't work quite that way.\n\n189\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.120\nAll right, so\nback to what we were talking about.\n\n190\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.130\nI'll get off my soapbox and\nget back to talking here.\n\n191\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.962\nSo all lowercase, try whatever it is.\n\n192\n00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:21.910\nI'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna drop that\ndown to actually five characters or\n\n193\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.510\nseven characters or whatever so\nwe know it's not gonna be as long.\n\n194\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.290\nRight, so we'll do that, and then\nclick Finish and now that's gonna run,\n\n195\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.990\nbut again, this could take a while, right,\nto decrypt, we may or may not know.\n\n196\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.800\nNow, this is a demo version as\nmany of the ones are you can see.\n\n197\n00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.020\nSo you know we're getting the hey,\ndo you wanna buy it?\n\n198\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.510\nNow the reason that is happening\nis it finds the password, but\n\n199\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.830\nthe demo version only shows you passwords\nup to three characters in length.\n\n200\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.650\nSo, it's got the asterisk there saying,\nhey it found it, but guess what?\n\n201\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.350\nYou wanna know what it is?\n\n202\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.171\nYou gonna buy it.\n\n203\n00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.571\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You and\n\n204\n00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.746\nI got to start creating like software,\nand doing this kind of stuff,\n\n205\n00:08:53.746 --> 00:08:57.500\nbecause the demo version isn't gonna show\nit to you, but the full version will.\n\n206\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.840\nSo for, insert credit card here,\nright and you can get it.\n\n207\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.550\nSo it does show us that, but it is\ntelling us hey, if you want to see it,\n\n208\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.190\nyou actually have to use the full version.\n\n209\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.870\nNow of course in the real world,\nas a forensic investigator,\n\n210\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.490\nwe would have access to licensed\nfully functional software.\n\n211\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.590\nAnd this limitation would\nnot be a problem, but\n\n212\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.990\nwe're showing you the idea\nbehind how the tool works.\n\n213\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.220\nNot necessarily the fact that,\nhey look, every password can be found.\n\n214\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.110\nIt can be.\nYou saw me do it with one that is three\n\n215\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.148\ncharacters in length, it's the same idea.\n\n216\n00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:26.570\nI just wanted to show you\nwhat the tool looks like,\n\n217\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.150\nhow it actually works if you\nhave to set it up from scratch.\n\n218\n00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.810\n&gt;&gt; Is Cain &amp; Abel still open source,\nor free?\n\n219\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It is?\n\n220\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.216\nSo we could have used that.\n\n221\n00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:35.148\n&gt;&gt; We could have used many of them.\n\n222\n00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:37.707\n&gt;&gt; John the Ripper,\nthere's a ton of free ones out there.\n\n223\n00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:41.595\n[CROSSTALK] but these pay ones tend\nto be a little more user friendly.\n\n224\n00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:42.396\n&gt;&gt; Well, they do.\n\n225\n00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:46.932\nYeah, I mean you're not writing, you don't\nhave to learn the command line syntax to\n\n226\n00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:50.024\nuse pwdump2, or\nJohn the Ripper that you would for this.\n\n227\n00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:54.139\nLophtCrack, an oldie but a goodie,\nand still a goodie, is still around.\n\n228\n00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:59.045\nYou can use it, it's just that it's harder\nto get the open source version Ophcrack,\n\n229\n00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:00.351\never use Ophcrack?\n\n230\n00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So Ophcrack,\n\n231\n00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:03.370\na Linux open source version of that.\n\n232\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.920\nThere's a lot of tools out there, so\n\n233\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.210\nthis is how we would do maybe like\na Word document, an Office document.\n\n234\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.740\nNow let's say we wanted to do\nsomething along the lines of a PDF,\n\n235\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.210\nwhich is also very common, right?\n\n236\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.440\nSo got a PDF sitting on\nour desktop right here.\n\n237\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.264\nYou can see it, all right, go to open it.\n\n238\n00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:21.221\nYou will see it does require a password,\nall right, so\n\n239\n00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:25.078\nat no point during this demonstration\nam I ever going to be able to access\n\n240\n00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:27.340\nsomething unless I decrypt it first.\n\n241\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.461\nSo let's go in, let's take a look, have a\ntool here we can often use, preloaded it,\n\n242\n00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:32.628\nAdvanced PDF Cracker.\n\n243\n00:10:32.628 --> 00:10:36.265\nYou may have seen this tool before,\nvery, very valuable tool.\n\n244\n00:10:36.265 --> 00:10:38.170\nI use it all the time.\n\n245\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.340\nSo I'm gonna go after this PDF right here.\n\n246\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.230\nAgain, you can see I could specify my\ncharacter sets A through Z, upper or\n\n247\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.150\nlowercase, numeric, special characters.\n\n248\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.360\nRemember we talked about\nthe Unicode characters set or\n\n249\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.460\nasking Unicode supporting spaces.\n\n250\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.060\nSpaces there is a separate option, because\nit is going to have to be programmed in or\n\n251\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.720\nwe won't look for\n\n252\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.930\nspaces, which makes it exponentially\nmore difficult to guess the password.\n\n253\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.790\nDo I start from, do I end from,\nwhat are the option there?\n\n254\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.330\nSo I can go through,\nI could see all of this.\n\n255\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.730\nI could do user defined as well if I want\nto, and I can go in and specify that.\n\n256\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.774\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna use the Open item right here.\n\n257\n00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:20.280\nI'm gonna go grab that PDF, right,\nTest3, we can see it right there.\n\n258\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.810\nAnd it comes up and\nit says okay, hey, guess what?\n\n259\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.280\nRight, this document can be decrypted\nwith the key search attack guaranteed.\n\n260\n00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.330\nI love guarantees, right?\n\n261\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.530\nEspecially when they work.\n\n262\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.730\nSo I can either put in the password if\nI know what it is, or I can go in and\n\n263\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.670\nI can decrypt it and open it up and find\nit, because it tells me that it thinks\n\n264\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.070\nthe password is easy enough that\nit'll find it for me, no problem.\n\n265\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.670\nSo, do decrypt now, right?\n\n266\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.090\nPassword typed in correct, nope.\n\n267\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.700\nSo, start recovery, no problem.\n\n268\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.848\nRecovery goes through and cracks\nthe password, finds it for me, right?\n\n269\n00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:54.370\nAnd says yep, here it is and\nlet's just go down right there.\n\n270\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.170\nPassword for this file right there gem,\nG-E-M, right?\n\n271\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.108\nThat's the password.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:11:59.108 --> 00:12:00.208\n&gt;&gt; Three digit password, yeah,\n\n273\n00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:02.080\nwe're keeping it incredibly simple for\nthis test.\n\n274\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.080\nRight, I mean, in the real world\nit wouldn't be that simple.\n\n275\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.990\nTake a little longer.\n\n276\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.738\n[CROSSTALK] The point is,\nyou'd still [INAUDIBLE]\n\n277\n00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:07.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:08.327\n&gt;&gt; I shouldn't say that,\n\n279\n00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.392\nbecause a lot of times the password\nis no password, right?\n\n280\n00:12:10.392 --> 00:12:11.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n281\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Hey, bad decisions are still decisions,\nthey're just not good ones.\n\n282\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.080\nSo, but it did find the password, right.\n\n283\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.460\nAnd I can easily go now and enter\nthe password, or I could go ahead and\n\n284\n00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.265\nsave off a version by decrypting it,\nand essentially removing or\n\n285\n00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:25.285\nstripping out the password.\n\n286\n00:12:25.285 --> 00:12:25.984\nSo I like this tool.\n\n287\n00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I can actually save an opened\n\n288\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.294\nversion of this,\nwithout the password applied,\n\n289\n00:12:30.294 --> 00:12:33.305\nleaving the password on\nthe original if I choose to.\n\n290\n00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:34.635\nBe up to me to decide.\n\n291\n00:12:34.635 --> 00:12:38.865\nSo I can go ahead, click OK,\nbecause I now know the password.\n\n292\n00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:43.355\nAnd I can simply go over here, and I can\njust enter the password in if I want to.\n\n293\n00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:47.110\nAnd decrypt the document, or I can save\nit off, it'll be up to me to decide.\n\n294\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.670\nSo keep in mind that once\nI crack the password,\n\n295\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.580\nI have access to the contents of the file.\n\n296\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.170\nAnd once I've done this as a forensics\ninvestigator, I can open the document and\n\n297\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.080\nsee what it is.\n\n298\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.290\nRemember, I'm doing this on my\nforensically sound secondary image\n\n299\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.110\nthat I've created.\n\n300\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.130\nI'm not doing this on the primary source.\n\n301\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.890\nI'm doing it on the images\nthat I've created.\n\n302\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.260\nSo taking that file and\n\n303\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.660\nmodifying it by saving off a copy\nis not gonna effect the integrity\n\n304\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.820\nof the evidence, it's just gonna allow\nme to understand what's in there.\n\n305\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.370\nAnd that's gonna be important for\nme to think about and be aware of.\n\n306\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.630\nSo, this is password cracking 101.\n\n307\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.600\nThere's obviously more to\nthis in the sense that\n\n308\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.090\nwe may get in to situations where we're\nnot gonna find the password easily.\n\n309\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.520\nBecause brute forcing is\njust going to take too long.\n\n310\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.520\nWe may need to go step up\nour game a little bit.\n\n311\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.340\nWe may need to do some recon,\nand some engineering, and\n\n312\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.700\nreverse engineering to narrow\ndown the password field choices.\n\n313\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.064\nIs it really English, is it a different\nlanguage, is it upper case, lower case?\n\n314\n00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:42.364\nThe more information we feed\ninto the tools you saw,\n\n315\n00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:45.900\nthe more likely it is we'll find a match\nand the quicker we'll find a match.\n\n316\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.430\nSo we may have to deduce and or\n\n317\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.840\nanalyze information to better understand\nwhat we should be putting in as choices.\n\n318\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.160\nAnd we may have to bring\nsome other mechanisms and\n\n319\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.400\ntools to bare in order to do that.\n\n320\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.230\nSo, wanna be thinking about that and\nbe aware of that, as well.\n\n321\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.120\nI wanna turn our attention\nto steganography.\n\n322\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.150\nAnd just give me one second before\nwe come back over to the machine,\n\n323\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.220\njust wanna load up one of\nthe tools we're gonna use.\n\n324\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.868\nSo I just wanna bring it up here for\nyou really quickly.\n\n325\n00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:11.810\nAll right, so if you join me here,\nwe have a tool.\n\n326\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.594\nSo it's very simple,\nit's almost like a kiddie tool,\n\n327\n00:14:14.594 --> 00:14:17.630\nin a sense that, it's a very,\nvery basic entry level tool.\n\n328\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.360\nBut it's a very effective one for\ncertain kinds of things.\n\n329\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.146\nStegSpy, I like the little\nfire haired guy here.\n\n330\n00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:26.913\nReminds me of kind of that wild\n1980s time, with the neon glasses\n\n331\n00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:27.486\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n332\n00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:29.730\n&gt;&gt; And all that craziness, right?\n\n333\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.210\nSo StegSpy is a tool that\nallows me to look at files,\n\n334\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.284\nimage files that may have been\nsteganographically modified.\n\n335\n00:14:35.284 --> 00:14:36.509\nAnd if they have been and\n\n336\n00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:41.520\nthey've been modified with certain\ntechniques that the tool does pick up on.\n\n337\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.510\nWill allow me to be told that the tool, or\n\n338\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.810\nrather that the file has been\nsteganographically modified.\n\n339\n00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.050\nNow, the file may or\nmay not be steganographically modified,\n\n340\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.740\nwe don't know for sure until we run it.\n\n341\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.085\nSo we do have to look.\n\n342\n00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:56.263\nSo let's go through,\nlet's run it against some images.\n\n343\n00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.765\nYou'll see I got some image files\nsitting on the desk right there.\n\n344\n00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.525\nSo let's just go ahead and grab a couple.\n\n345\n00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.375\nLet's see what we find.\n\n346\n00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:03.895\nSo run, right,\nwe just go through, we grab them.\n\n347\n00:15:03.895 --> 00:15:07.100\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna grab this image right here.\n\n348\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.210\nThis image file is one that I started out\nwith, just downloaded off the Internet,\n\n349\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.860\ngot a couple of these pictures here.\n\n350\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.160\nThis one is gonna be of just a computer,\nright?\n\n351\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.230\nNothing fancy.\n\n352\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.453\nAnd it says, sorry,\nno steganography found,\n\n353\n00:15:18.453 --> 00:15:21.353\nbecause the file has not been\nsteganographically modified.\n\n354\n00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.300\nOkay, no big deal.\n\n355\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.470\nThere is another copy of this file that I\ncreated called Stegme1, which I'm gonna\n\n356\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.740\nshow you how to create in a few moments\nusing another piece of software.\n\n357\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.530\nBut I actually steganographically modified\nthat image, and I joined data to it and\n\n358\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.980\ncreated a steganographically\nmodified image.\n\n359\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.450\nSo this copy of that file is actually\nsteganographically modified.\n\n360\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.553\nWhen I run it through this tool,\nit also says sorry, no steg imagery found.\n\n361\n00:15:46.553 --> 00:15:50.756\nBecause the modification technique that\nI used is not a technique that this tool\n\n362\n00:15:50.756 --> 00:15:52.460\nunderstands or will register.\n\n363\n00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.214\nSo even though I know,\nI know because I did it that,\n\n364\n00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:58.330\nthat file has been\nsteganographically modified.\n\n365\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.700\nThis tool does not pick it up.\n\n366\n00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.840\nNow that's not to say that\nother tools won't pick it up,\n\n367\n00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.650\njust to say that as we talked\nabout cross-referencing our data\n\n368\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.880\nthrough multiple tools to ensure that we\nget accurate results is very critical,\n\n369\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.980\ncuz the file that I'm looking at has\nbeen steganographically modified.\n\n370\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.540\nIt's very important to know that.\n\n371\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.440\nSo sometimes the tools are good, but\n\n372\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.160\nsometimes they may not be\nup to the task at hand.\n\n373\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.730\nSo how do we actually create\nsteganographically modified data?\n\n374\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.710\nWell one of the ways we could do\nthat is to bring up the tool here.\n\n375\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.068\nJust minimize,\njust bring this on over here.\n\n376\n00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:38.070\nTool called OpenStego will allow us to do\nthis, where I can actually extract data or\n\n377\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.580\nhide data.\n\n378\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.950\nYou'll see that right here.\n\n379\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.944\nI can go in, and I can use this tool to\nbreak steganographically modified files\n\n380\n00:16:43.944 --> 00:16:48.320\ninto a component parts, but it can also\ncreate steganographically modified files.\n\n381\n00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.410\nThat's what I did with this tool.\n\n382\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:56.128\nI went ahead and I actually took\nthe file that I created, right?\n\n383\n00:16:56.128 --> 00:16:58.749\nSort of that I had right here this file,\ntook the word document,\n\n384\n00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:01.920\ncombined the two together to create\nthis stegnographically modified file.\n\n385\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.380\nNow before I do that,\nlet me show you one other tool here.\n\n386\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.870\nImage steganography,\njust another tool that's available to us.\n\n387\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.370\nJust put that right up there.\n\n388\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.620\nAnd image steganography allows\nme to decide or to look at and\n\n389\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.350\nexamine whether files again like steg spy.\n\n390\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.460\nWhether files have been steganographically\nmodified or not, right?\n\n391\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:27.970\nSo what I can do, is I can go in and\ngrab the modified tool, or modified.\n\n392\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.830\nNotice I just drag it over here and I drop\nit in here, so it knows to work with it.\n\n393\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.521\nJust a drag and drop interface.\n\n394\n00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:35.470\nI can type it in, but up to me.\n\n395\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.700\nSo I just drag it over there.\n\n396\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.120\nNow this is the file that I did\nsteganographically modified, right?\n\n397\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.170\nSo am I going to embed, right?\n\n398\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.980\nAm I gonna enlarge, or\nam I going to encode or decode?\n\n399\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.790\nWhat am I doing?\n\n400\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.880\nWell I wanna decode.\n\n401\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.520\nI wanna see if it's been\nsteganographically modified, right?\n\n402\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.450\nSo I'm gonna decode, right?\n\n403\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.670\nSo I'm gonna switch to decode, grab that,\ndrag down over again just so that it loads\n\n404\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:01.040\nthe right way, start, and it says,\nhey it's either corrupted or invalid.\n\n405\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.480\nAgain this file or\nthis tool cannot read this file type.\n\n406\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.820\nBut it may be able to read certain files,\nright?\n\n407\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.368\nSo if I take this file right here, right?\n\n408\n00:18:10.368 --> 00:18:14.070\nThis other file and I decode it, right?\n\n409\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.377\nNot reading it either, right?\n\n410\n00:18:15.377 --> 00:18:20.810\nIf I take this file which is the original\nsource file, do that, not reading it.\n\n411\n00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.003\nIt's not reading JPGs,\nthese are all JPGs, right?\n\n412\n00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:25.151\nBut it would read bitmaps,\nit would read GIFs, right?\n\n413\n00:18:25.151 --> 00:18:27.114\nSo again, it's not just the file.\n\n414\n00:18:27.114 --> 00:18:28.491\nIt may be the file extension or\n\n415\n00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:31.147\nthe file type that we're\nhaving a problem with, right?\n\n416\n00:18:31.147 --> 00:18:32.530\nThat could also be an issue.\n\n417\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.020\nWe may have to go in other words and\nfind different files and\n\n418\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.850\ndifferent types to use\nwith different tools.\n\n419\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.330\nThis is the issue with the steganographic\ntool sets that we use.\n\n420\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.150\nThey're not all designed\nto work with everything,\n\n421\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.060\nand we have to understand\nthe limitations of the tool, right?\n\n422\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.540\nSo I'm just showing you some\ndifferent real world scenarios and\n\n423\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.660\nissues that may come up,\n\n424\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.820\nbecause we may not necessarily be able\nto use every tool with every file type.\n\n425\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.830\nSo we know for a fact, so I said this file\nis steganographically modified because I\n\n426\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.330\ncreated it and modified it.\n\n427\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.894\nSo let's go back to this\ntool right here and\n\n428\n00:19:02.894 --> 00:19:06.855\nlet's take the Stegme1\ndata file right here.\n\n429\n00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.850\nWe'll just kinda put our software\nright below it, so we could see it.\n\n430\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.220\nThis tool, this file right here and\nlet's look at it.\n\n431\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.010\nNow by the way, let's open this\nbefore we actually do anything.\n\n432\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.810\nLet's just go ahead and\nlet's do the following.\n\n433\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:23.727\nSo let me open this, and\njust open it up with photos.\n\n434\n00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:26.229\nAnd you could see it's just\na picture of a computer, right?\n\n435\n00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:27.650\nAn old school computer.\n\n436\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.150\nIt's been a long time since you\nsaw a joystick like that, right?\n\n437\n00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.100\nSo it's just a picture, just opened\nup with I don't know a digger or\n\n438\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.980\nsomething on the screen.\n\n439\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.838\nRemember digger?\n\n440\n00:19:35.838 --> 00:19:36.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n441\n00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:37.474\nRemember it's probably a video game like\n\n442\n00:19:37.474 --> 00:19:39.104\nthat.\nThis is an old image, right?\n\n443\n00:19:39.104 --> 00:19:40.253\nSo I just kind of found a picture\n\n444\n00:19:40.253 --> 00:19:41.700\non the Internet and downloaded it.\n\n445\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.010\nIt doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n446\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.410\nSo that's the picture that has been\nstegonographically modified right there,\n\n447\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.705\nStegme1.\n\n448\n00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:51.719\nLet's open this other one up right here,\nthe original source one.\n\n449\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.654\nAnd, You can see,\n\n450\n00:19:58.654 --> 00:20:02.694\nright, if I snap two and\ndo them side by side, that there is\n\n451\n00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:07.460\nno difference to the discernible\nnaked eye view of this picture.\n\n452\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.510\nThere's no discernible difference\nbetween these two images, right?\n\n453\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.120\nI am looking at two images that for\nall intents and\n\n454\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.770\npurposes are gonna look the same.\n\n455\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.738\nLet me just expose the file names there,\nright?\n\n456\n00:20:18.738 --> 00:20:23.190\nStegme1, this is the modified image\nthat I have steganographically altered.\n\n457\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.180\nAnd this is the original source\nimage with the crazy long\n\n458\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.840\nalphanumeric file name sitting there.\n\n459\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.650\nWhen you open them both up they\nlook identical in just the standard\n\n460\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.420\nviewer tool right?\n\n461\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.010\nThere seems to be no difference.\n\n462\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.820\nAnd indeed to the average\nperson there is not, right?\n\n463\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.700\nSo let's just get rid of both of those for\na minute here.\n\n464\n00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.070\nLet's kinda do that.\n\n465\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.470\nSo now that you've seen that they\nare indeed going to look the same, right?\n\n466\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.070\nSo let's just come back over here and\nlet's see what we did here.\n\n467\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.270\nSo if I take this file that has been\nsteganographically modified, and\n\n468\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.800\nI want to extract data from it,\nright here at the bottom.\n\n469\n00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.670\nSo I have to specify the input stego file.\n\n470\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.880\nSo let's do that, Stegme1.\n\n471\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.550\nWhere do I wanna output this, right?\n\n472\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.180\nSo where do I wanna put this?\n\n473\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.498\nSo let's specify a folder on the desktop,\nright?\n\n474\n00:21:09.498 --> 00:21:15.486\nCalled, Stegme1, so that we know\nthat that's where it's gonna go.\n\n475\n00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:18.457\nCreated it right now, just so\nyou see me doing this real time.\n\n476\n00:21:18.457 --> 00:21:19.940\nAnd I'm just gonna path to it, right?\n\n477\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:25.208\nSo we'll just go grab that file, that's\nwhere we wanna put it right there, okay?\n\n478\n00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:28.940\nAnd then,\nwhat we're gonna do is extract data.\n\n479\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.950\nMessage file successfully extracted.\n\n480\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.330\nAnd notice what it says right there.\n\n481\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.470\nLet me just bring this up,\nso you can see it.\n\n482\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.455\nIt says message file successfully\nextracted from the cover file.\n\n483\n00:21:38.455 --> 00:21:41.070\nTest2.doc is the file that we extracted.\n\n484\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.420\nRemember I told you I took\nthis Word document and\n\n485\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.480\nI merged it with the file,\nthe cover medium, the picture, and\n\n486\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.640\nI created this stegonographically\nmodified image.\n\n487\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.840\nDid you see that Word\ndocument sitting in there?\n\n488\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.360\nThat's got like 12 pages of text and\ncontent and pictures and\n\n489\n00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.390\nall sorts of stuff at it.\n\n490\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.720\nYou didn't see any of that in there,\nright?\n\n491\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.050\nYou saw nothing in there.\n\n492\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.770\nYou saw no way to know that\nfile had been modified, right?\n\n493\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.940\nBut when I go in here, and now the icon\non the folder may have changed.\n\n494\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.240\nIf you can take a look you can see it,\nright?\n\n495\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.110\nIt's actually there.\n\n496\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.880\nIt's got the Word document right there,\nright?\n\n497\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.550\nThere it is.\n\n498\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.140\nNow I would have to know the password for\nthe Word document, cuz you remember,\n\n499\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.970\nthis is the document we used in\nthe password cracking exercise.\n\n500\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.302\nBut we could crack the password and\nsay, okay, hey, that must be the secret\n\n501\n00:22:21.302 --> 00:22:25.786\ndocument that the bad actor is looking\nto take the secret formula for recipe X.\n\n502\n00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:27.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And take it away.\n\n503\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.105\nSo now if I get that, I can open it up and\nverify they did that.\n\n504\n00:22:30.105 --> 00:22:33.688\nAnd now I've got the perfect evidence in\na court of law to actually convict them of\n\n505\n00:22:33.688 --> 00:22:34.860\nsmuggling data, right?\n\n506\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.270\nOr whatever I'm gonna convict them of.\n\n507\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.670\nSo this will be the multi-step\nprocess in the investigation.\n\n508\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.020\nIf something like that little password\nscreening is going to stop me?\n\n509\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.690\nNo, we now know how to deal with that,\nright?\n\n510\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; We go ahead and\n\n511\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.928\nwe just simply crack the password,\nand then we get the document.\n\n512\n00:22:46.928 --> 00:22:49.378\nSo you could see that\nstenographically modifying and\n\n513\n00:22:49.378 --> 00:22:53.252\nthen separating the data doesn't decrypt\nit, it just protects it with a password.\n\n514\n00:22:53.252 --> 00:22:55.230\nBut I've shown you tools and\ntechniques to deal with that.\n\n515\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.600\nThat's not hard, right?\n\n516\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.550\nNow let me show you how\nI actually did this.\n\n517\n00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.220\nLet's go back to the tool, right?\n\n518\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.900\nSo if I wanna hide the data,\n\n519\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.930\nI wanna create that\nstenographically modified file.\n\n520\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.440\nAll you need are two pieces.\n\n521\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.856\nI need the cover medium,\nI need the data I wanna hide.\n\n522\n00:23:08.856 --> 00:23:10.700\nI need a tool that lets\nme join the two together.\n\n523\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.070\nWell we have all three of those, right?\n\n524\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.735\nSo switch the tool into Hide Data mode.\n\n525\n00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:17.930\nHide data in the harmless looking file.\n\n526\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.080\nWhat is the message file?\n\n527\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.640\nThe message file is the data I wanna hide.\n\n528\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.200\nNo big deal.\n\n529\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.030\nLet's go grab that.\n\n530\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.439\nLet's say I wanna hide the PDF this time,\ntest 3 pdf.\n\n531\n00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:30.346\nThat PDF we looked up right there.\n\n532\n00:23:30.346 --> 00:23:32.360\nWhat's the cover file gonna be?\n\n533\n00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.880\nNo big deal.\n\n534\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.470\nLet's find the cover file.\n\n535\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.590\nLet's use our computer file again,\nright, computer image.\n\n536\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.390\nWhere is the output Stego file gonna be?\n\n537\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.150\nWhere am I gonna output it to?\n\n538\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.715\nI'm gonna output it to the desktop.\n\n539\n00:23:42.715 --> 00:23:43.746\nAnd what am I gonna call it?\n\n540\n00:23:43.746 --> 00:23:48.759\nInstead of Stegme1, let's call it Stegme2.\n\n541\n00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:50.940\nClick open and.\n\n542\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.439\nLet's move this up here for a second.\n\n543\n00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:58.100\nI can password protected if I want to,\nup to me, high data, boom.\n\n544\n00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.970\nData's been hidden.\n\n545\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.480\nI now have, where did it go?\n\n546\n00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.806\nStag me one, where's stag me two?\n\n547\n00:24:05.806 --> 00:24:08.514\nShouldn't been hidden, did it not?\n\n548\n00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:11.059\nI did put it on the desktop, did I not?\n\n549\n00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:11.893\nYes, I did.\n\n550\n00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:12.843\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n551\n00:24:12.843 --> 00:24:14.446\n&gt;&gt; We're just missing it.\n\n552\n00:24:14.446 --> 00:24:17.307\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm missing it,\nbut there, it is not there.\n\n553\n00:24:17.307 --> 00:24:18.845\nWhere did it go?\n\n554\n00:24:18.845 --> 00:24:21.750\nThere's that one, that one, that one.\n\n555\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.703\nAnd, unless I wound up putting it,\nnope, should be there,\n\n556\n00:24:25.703 --> 00:24:27.726\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n557\n00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:28.451\nHold on one sec.\n\n558\n00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:29.981\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I know I'm creating it.\n\n559\n00:24:29.981 --> 00:24:30.769\n&gt;&gt; At first you don't succeed.\n\n560\n00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:32.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it is working,\n\n561\n00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:33.486\nlet's just try this one more time.\n\n562\n00:24:33.486 --> 00:24:36.780\nWe try this, we switch that up real quick.\n\n563\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.980\nAnd, you know what, let me change the file\nname, cuz it might just be sitting there,\n\n564\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.020\nand let's call it stag 456 or\nsomething like that.\n\n565\n00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.101\nAnd go in, and hide data.\n\n566\n00:24:50.101 --> 00:24:52.013\nAnd why am I not getting a file?\n\n567\n00:24:52.013 --> 00:24:53.070\nThat is absolutely crazy.\n\n568\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.570\nLet's do this,\nbecause I have the tool open.\n\n569\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.352\nLet me close the tool, and\nlet me close the other tool,\n\n570\n00:24:58.352 --> 00:25:01.146\nI have open in case it's\nlocking one of the files open.\n\n571\n00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.812\nIt may actually be locking one of\nthe files we're using as a source, and\n\n572\n00:25:03.812 --> 00:25:05.731\nmay be throwing an arrow\nwithout us seeing in that.\n\n573\n00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:07.697\nMaybe why we are getting\nthat random behavior.\n\n574\n00:25:07.697 --> 00:25:10.940\nLet me just open the tool back up, and\nthen we will go ahead and launch it again.\n\n575\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.800\nSo, let me go in here real quick.\n\n576\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:20.500\nAnd just let me go grab our tool,\nand just run open Stegos.\n\n577\n00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.350\nJust open it back up fresh.\n\n578\n00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.716\nLet's hide our data,\njust grab our message file.\n\n579\n00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:28.470\nLet's go out here for our message file.\n\n580\n00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.230\nLet's do on our spreadsheet this time.\n\n581\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.340\nLet's grab our cover image,\ngrab that one instead.\n\n582\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.391\nLet's output this,\nlet's specify where we gonna output it to.\n\n583\n00:25:39.391 --> 00:25:46.934\nAnd let's call it just in,\noops, just in time, 123.\n\n584\n00:25:49.088 --> 00:25:51.740\nAnd let's hide data.\n\n585\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.363\nAll right, that looks better, then there\nwe go right down there was created.\n\n586\n00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:57.630\nMaybe just a little glitch went on in\nthe machine files being left open or\n\n587\n00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.237\nsomething.\n\n588\n00:25:58.237 --> 00:26:01.250\nAnd so I just went ahead and used\na different picture, and just modified.\n\n589\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.830\nBut you could see, it actually went\nthrough does it with no trouble,\n\n590\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.040\nrelatively speaking, right?\n\n591\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.001\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n592\n00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:06.851\n&gt;&gt; And goes ahead, and\n\n593\n00:26:06.851 --> 00:26:08.950\nlet me just minimize it down so\nyou could see.\n\n594\n00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.290\nAnd I just went ahead and\nstegonographically modified the data,\n\n595\n00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.710\ncreated and output in another file,\nthat now has been modified.\n\n596\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.075\nIf I was to now take that file,\nand email it to somebody.\n\n597\n00:26:18.075 --> 00:26:22.435\nUnless we were running the files,\nthe attachment through a stenographically\n\n598\n00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:27.145\naware scanner, looking for DLP,\ndata loss prevention capabilities.\n\n599\n00:26:27.145 --> 00:26:30.197\nWe'd have no idea that the data\nis in there and that document,\n\n600\n00:26:30.197 --> 00:26:33.877\nthat spreadsheet,or whatever I attached,\nhas just been sent out of the system, and\n\n601\n00:26:33.877 --> 00:26:35.107\nnobody knows it's gone.\n\n602\n00:26:35.107 --> 00:26:37.907\nAnd whoever gets it would\njust separate the two, and\n\n603\n00:26:37.907 --> 00:26:41.017\nwould have, as you saw, the document or\nthe spreadsheet or whatever.\n\n604\n00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:43.727\nThey'd throw away the cover medium,\nthey don't care about picture, and\n\n605\n00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:46.447\nthey would be able to get the data,\nand I've sent it right out in\n\n606\n00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.977\nthe clear in the open,\nunder everybody's noses in attachment.\n\n607\n00:26:48.977 --> 00:26:50.247\nAnd nobody even knows it was there.\n\n608\n00:26:50.247 --> 00:26:50.847\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n609\n00:26:50.847 --> 00:26:56.490\nIt's very all scary on how easy it\nis to just go download, and install,\n\n610\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.390\nand run these tools that will allow\nyou to perform stenographic activity,\n\n611\n00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.400\nright, and engage in that.\n\n612\n00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.840\nIt's kind of fun, right, but also, with\ngreat power comes great responsibility.\n\n613\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.970\n&gt;&gt; That's Sheldon Cooper.\n\n614\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.311\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's Sheldon Cooper\nsays who is quoting actually, Ben Parker,\n\n615\n00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:15.301\nnot Peter Parker.\n\n616\n00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:20.463\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's yes.\n\n617\n00:27:20.463 --> 00:27:22.333\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n618\n00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nthat being said, [LAUGH].\n\n619\n00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.720\nBut good for\nus to know as forensic investigators,\n\n620\n00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.010\nthat we can now engage in\nlooking at these files,\n\n621\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.150\nand finding if there's any steganographic\ninformation inside of them.\n\n622\n00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.530\nAnd ultimately,\nmaybe even finding a smoking gun one day.\n\n623\n00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.560\nSo, have that in your\ntool kit at the ready.\n\n624\n00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.150\nNow you've seen how that works.\n\n625\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.570\nGo and download these tools,\nand play with them, so\n\n626\n00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.331\nthat you have that practical\nexperience with them as well.\n\n627\n00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:48.412\nAdam, thanks for showing us where\nwe can go, and what we can do,\n\n628\n00:27:48.412 --> 00:27:50.250\nand how we can work with that.\n\n629\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.240\nBottom looking at our clock, it looks\nlike we're out of time for this episode.\n\n630\n00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.950\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n631\n00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.910\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n632\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.483\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n633\n00:28:00.483 -->

watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.873\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.873 --> 00:00:17.110\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.260\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode.\n\n7\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.280\nWell, I hope you're\nexcited because I sure am.\n\n8\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.060\nWe're back with more on our\nCHFI version nine series and\n\n9\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.840\njoining us back in the studio yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.287\nEven though you can see he has probably\nchanged a little last time he saw us.\n\n11\n00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:32.079\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:32.694\nAdam, welcome man.\n\n13\n00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:33.333\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.450\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.050\nIt's going well.\n\n16\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.770\nYou know, we do rotate things\naround from time to time.\n\n17\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.374\n&gt;&gt; Keep it fresh.\n\n18\n00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:38.384\n&gt;&gt; Keep it interesting.\n\n19\n00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:40.410\nDaniel and I need a change of scenery.\n\n20\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.527\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; This time we have a window.\n\n21\n00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:42.520\nLast time we didn't.\n\n22\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.430\nYou know, that kind of stuff.\n\n23\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.858\nAnyway, we are here to\ncontinue talking about CHFI.\n\n24\n00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.970\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout operating system forensics.\n\n25\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.080\nThe methodologies associated with that.\n\n26\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.980\nHow do we deal with Linux,\nWindows, Mac, et cetera.\n\n27\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.170\nWe've been talking up until now\nabout all the different pieces of\n\n28\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.370\nthe forensics puzzle.\n\n29\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.080\nWhat's the overall methodology for\nincident response?\n\n30\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.416\nHow do we deal with some\nof the background material?\n\n31\n00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:06.644\nHow do we identify the kind of\nevidence we need that's volatile?\n\n32\n00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:09.470\nHow do we ensure we\ncapture it successfully?\n\n33\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.280\nHow do we deal with not just volatile\nevidence, but chain of custody?\n\n34\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.890\nWe spent a lot of time talking about that,\ntalking about the laws, the regulations,\n\n35\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.860\nthe rules that may have to be followed for\nus to not only have a forensic in sound\n\n36\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.330\nmethodology for evidence gathering, but\npresentation of that evidence if necessary\n\n37\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.350\nthrough a court of law and perhaps through\nthe cycle of what a trial may entail.\n\n38\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.270\nWe spend a lot of time building\nup all that knowledge.\n\n39\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.430\nWhat we're gonna do is really\nturn our attention here, and\n\n40\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430\ngoing forward into some of the other\nepisodes that'll come after this,\n\n41\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.830\ninto network forensics,\ndatabase forensics, email forensics.\n\n42\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.960\nReally start carving up individual\nareas of the operating system and/or\n\n43\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070\nthe applications running on top of it,\nregardless of what the OS is.\n\n44\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.170\nAnd as an investigator,\nreally start to turn our attention\n\n45\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.900\nto the application of that knowledge,\nthe methodology, the skills.\n\n46\n00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.640\nThe thought process to the practical hands\non acquisition of data and the practical\n\n47\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.815\nhands on gathering and maintenance of that\ndata throughout the evidence lifecycle.\n\n48\n00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:07.327\nI'm sure we're gonna\nspend time talking about.\n\n49\n00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.650\nWe're gonna delve in in this\nparticular set of conversations,\n\n50\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.690\nlook primarily at the Windows OS.\n\n51\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.220\nIt is the most prevalent operating\nsystem we see in the enterprise today.\n\n52\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.030\nSo we wanna obviously give it its due.\n\n53\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.890\nSpend as much time as we need to there.\n\n54\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.890\nUncover all the secrets, the mysteries\nof the registry, the IE Explorer,\n\n55\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.380\nthe file cache,\nall the things we have to know about.\n\n56\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.570\nWe'll talk about Linux,\ntalk about Mac as well, because certainly,\n\n57\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.930\nthose operating systems no less important.\n\n58\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.130\nWe'll spend some upcoming episodes\ntalking specifically about mobile and\n\n59\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.190\ngo into Android, for instance, and\ntake a look at some of that stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.180\nWe'll do a capture on some\ndata from a mobile device,\n\n61\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.110\nquote unquote, of an Android capture.\n\n62\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.920\nTake a look at DD images.\n\n63\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.570\nA lot of cool stuff that we've either done\nor we'll reference again or will be coming\n\n64\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.820\nup or we'll do in this episode in a set of\nseries of shows as we continue through.\n\n65\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.680\nBut what we're trying to do is\nweave an ongoing story, and\n\n66\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.950\nreally tell that story end to\nend with some common themes,\n\n67\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.450\nright those threads that have\nto be part of our conversation.\n\n68\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.910\nWhen we've Daniel if you are thinking\nthrough the logic like I'm trying to lay\n\n69\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.260\nit out here of what\nwe've done up until now.\n\n70\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.340\nWe think about some of those themes\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n71\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.340\nFrom your perspective right you've\ndone this a long time like I have.\n\n72\n00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.980\nYou've got a lot of hands on practical\nexperience as a system administrator,\n\n73\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.070\nnetwork admin, working with users.\n\n74\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.170\nYou always regale us with stories from the\npast of all the users you've dealt with.\n\n75\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.280\nWhat are some of the most important\nthings from your perspective?\n\n76\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.500\nWhat do you think are some of those common\nthemes, themes we we've been talking about\n\n77\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.010\nthat as a forensic investigator, we wanna\ncarry through and be thinking about?\n\n78\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.660\nWhat comes to mind?\n\n79\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Things like, I'm thinking for\ninstance, chain of custody, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Important as a theme.\n\n81\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.460\nThere may be others, some practical\nhands on things, some theory things.\n\n82\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.990\nWhat are things that jump into your\nmind that maybe we wanna share\n\n83\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.800\nbefore we get started,\njust to set the tone?\n\n84\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.130\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking about\ncollecting data specifically.\n\n85\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.970\nSomething has happened or\nsomeone thinks something has happened,\n\n86\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.770\nmaking sure the first\nresponders know their job.\n\n87\n00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.360\nAnd people that maybe not be a first\nresponder per se know not to start\n\n88\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.000\naggravating the situation\nmaybe is a good way to put it.\n\n89\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.200\nAnd getting the right person involved so\nthat data integrity and\n\n90\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.750\nthe integrity of the scene is maintained.\n\n91\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so data integrity, integrity\nof the scene, keeping that chain of\n\n92\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.995\ncustody that ultimately we've talked about\nkind of is that outcome of that process.\n\n93\n00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:24.535\nProbably the most important thing.\n\n94\n00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:27.605\nI think I would've gone with the same\nexact answer Daniel gave you.\n\n95\n00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:29.365\nThat's number one up on the list.\n\n96\n00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:31.355\nMethodology kinda below that.\n\n97\n00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:32.595\nIt encompasses that, but\n\n98\n00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:37.427\nmethodology below that with regards\nto the specificity of, in this case,\n\n99\n00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:42.267\nthe Windows OS forensics methodology or\nincident handling response methodologies.\n\n100\n00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.547\nWe've spent a lot of time in\nsome of the shows already.\n\n101\n00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:46.670\nWe'll do so in upcoming shows as well.\n\n102\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.870\nTalking about certain methodologies,\nlaying them out for\n\n103\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.460\nyou, giving you the benefit of what\nthose methodical steps should look like.\n\n104\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.050\nWhat you should be prepared to do, and\nreally the order that we think about.\n\n105\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.690\nTalk about the order of volatility\nof evidence, for instance.\n\n106\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.520\nThese kind of ordered numbered lists,\n\n107\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.360\nthese process flows,\nlinear progression of steps.\n\n108\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.460\nVery important with regards\nto exam preparation.\n\n109\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.920\nWe stress that for you,\ntry to remind you of that,\n\n110\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.980\ncontinue to have you think about that.\n\n111\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.600\nJust want you to be aware of that and\nbe thinking about that.\n\n112\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.770\nWhen we talk about\nthe Forensics Methodology.\n\n113\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.250\nIf you want to just take\na look on the screen,\n\n114\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.740\nwe'll put it up here for you real quick.\n\n115\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.900\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n116\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.020\nYou could see that we have, let me just\ntab over here while we're talking,\n\n117\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.320\nwe'll just move these over so\nyou guys can see them.\n\n118\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.120\nBut, collecting volatile information,\nwe've talked about the importance of this.\n\n119\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.370\nWe've talked about the importance\nof collecting non-volatile\n\n120\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.070\ninformation as well.\n\n121\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.740\nWhy this is so important?\n\n122\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.580\nLet's just quickly remind you of\nthe difference between the two just\n\n123\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.500\nwhile I'm tabbing over.\n\n124\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.760\nAnd I apologize for\ntalking to my keyboard for just a minute.\n\n125\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.130\nBut that way I don't delete something\nby mistake while I'm talking to you.\n\n126\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.650\nBut collective volatile information,\n\n127\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.620\nwhen you think about the fact that\nwe're talking about dynamic data.\n\n128\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.810\nSo memory register data,\ndata that may be in caches.\n\n129\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.670\nWe've taken a look things like\nthe R cache, for instance.\n\n130\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.474\nTalk about the NetBIOS,\nNbtstat, netstat caches,\n\n131\n00:06:06.474 --> 00:06:10.200\nIpconfig/displaydns, the name\nresolver cache.\n\n132\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.204\nTalking about a lot of from places where\nvolatile information may live in Windows,\n\n133\n00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:17.750\nwanna be thinking about that,\nbecause that's gonna be our first order of\n\n134\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.100\ninformation, wanna go after,\nas Daniel was suggesting.\n\n135\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.380\nKeep the evidence clean, right, don't\nget in there and start messing around.\n\n136\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.763\nDon't potentially change\nthe date through that evidence.\n\n137\n00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:32.278\nWe talked a lot in prior episodes about\nthe need to ensure that it's we capture\n\n138\n00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:36.654\ndata, we're doing it off the machine\nin a way that will regulate the flow of\n\n139\n00:06:36.654 --> 00:06:39.150\ninformation so it is outbound only.\n\n140\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.632\nRight, so write blockers are a good\nexample of what we've talked about.\n\n141\n00:06:41.632 --> 00:06:44.234\nAnd we've shown you what\nwrite blockers look like.\n\n142\n00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:48.446\nWe've talked about the hardware\ntypically associated with that, the idea\n\n143\n00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:53.160\nthat it's a one-way transmission of\ndata from the source to the destination.\n\n144\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.240\nNo ability to write back or\nchange file stamps,\n\n145\n00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.940\nchange access times, things like that,\nproperties, metadata.\n\n146\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.650\nAll that is protected as we capture\nan image whether we use DD and Linux or\n\n147\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.500\nwe use one of the Windows based\nimaging platforms, the Access FTK or\n\n148\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.360\nthe disk imaging tools\nthat we talked about and\n\n149\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.460\nwe'll continue to talk about in the whole\nconversation about hard drives.\n\n150\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.890\nAnd the geometry and\nthe nature of hard drives.\n\n151\n00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.020\nLot of episodes on that.\n\n152\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.800\nWe've talked all about storage and\nhow we deal with that.\n\n153\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.810\nAll that kinda stuff, right,\nwe wanna be thinking about.\n\n154\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.020\nBecause any nature,\n\n155\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.850\nany evidence rather that has changed\nin any way the nature of that evidence.\n\n156\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.240\nIf we can't validate it,\nif we don't have integrity,\n\n157\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.920\nas we often have talked about,\nthen the evidence is worthless.\n\n158\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.741\nAnd at the very beginning, if we screw up\ngathering of evidence at the step 1 here,\n\n159\n00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.469\nas you can see,\nby the time we get down to steps 2, 3, 4,\n\n160\n00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:45.603\nall the way through to step 8,\nthat data has been tainted, right?\n\n161\n00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:49.836\nThere's no value in any of that data\nto us as forensic investigators,\n\n162\n00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:54.501\nto our clients we're doing the work for,\nto law enforcement, ultimately,\n\n163\n00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:58.158\nto a court, perhaps to a judge,\nwhether it's a jury trial or\n\n164\n00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:01.496\nsimply a bench trial as we call it,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n165\n00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:03.275\nThat evidence is no longer valid.\n\n166\n00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.002\nAnd remember we get one bite, right?\n\n167\n00:08:05.002 --> 00:08:08.718\nAt that proverbial apple, to get it\nright as Daniel pointed out to us.\n\n168\n00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:12.511\nIf we don't get it right now, right up\nfront at the beginning and we can't prove\n\n169\n00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:15.796\nbeyond a what we call a reasonable doubt,\nthat there is integrity and\n\n170\n00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:18.878\na chain of custody associated\nwith that evidence at every step.\n\n171\n00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:22.801\nFrom the time we begin to look at it\nuntil the time it's no longer valuable,\n\n172\n00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:24.000\nwe're done, right?\n\n173\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.914\nThat evidence will not\nsee the light of day,\n\n174\n00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:27.686\nwe will not be able to use that evidence.\n\n175\n00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:31.015\nSo collecting non-volatile information,\ndata information,\n\n176\n00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:33.015\ninterchangeable terms here, right?\n\n177\n00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:36.206\nWhen we talk about that, so\nnon-volatile information.\n\n178\n00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:39.232\nSo, I've given you some examples\nof volatile data, right?\n\n179\n00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:41.837\nThe R cache, the NBT or NETSTAT caches,\n\n180\n00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:45.898\nthe display DNS name resolver cache,\nthe contents of memory,\n\n181\n00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:50.207\nthe active RAM in the system,\nthese are all examples of volatile.\n\n182\n00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:52.191\nWhat about non-volatile data?\n\n183\n00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:55.143\nWell, things like registry\nkeys are non-volatile.\n\n184\n00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:58.303\nFor the most part,\nthey're not gonna change and power down.\n\n185\n00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:00.587\nThe name of the machine,\nnon-volatile data.\n\n186\n00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:04.113\nAs silly as that sounds, important,\ngotta know what machine we're targeting,\n\n187\n00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:05.811\ngotta know what it's called, right?\n\n188\n00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.397\nGotta know what operating system\nis installed, what service pack.\n\n189\n00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:15.435\nSomething as simple,\nliterally as doing a Winver command.\n\n190\n00:09:15.435 --> 00:09:18.198\nLet me just bring the Run line up here,\nkinda front and center so\n\n191\n00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:18.993\nyou can see this.\n\n192\n00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:21.068\nI'm on Windows 10 right now.\n\n193\n00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:25.844\nI'll Winver, short for Windows Version,\nand Windows will give you the name of\n\n194\n00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:30.567\nthe Operating System, or the information,\nthe build information on the OS.\n\n195\n00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:35.148\nYou can see it here,\nWindows 10 Version 1607 build\n\n196\n00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:39.932\n14393.1198, whatever\nthat build equates to.\n\n197\n00:09:39.932 --> 00:09:43.843\nAnd depending on the version of Windows,\nyou may get service pack information,\n\n198\n00:09:43.843 --> 00:09:45.582\nearlier versions like Windows 7.\n\n199\n00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:50.350\nWhen you ran WINVER you'd find service\npack there, some additional information.\n\n200\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.211\nThat's an example of non-volatile data,\nthat information doesn't change, but\n\n201\n00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:56.861\nit is important to capture.\n\n202\n00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:59.069\nWho's the product licensed to, right?\n\n203\n00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:00.759\nWe could see Nate's name is there, right?\n\n204\n00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:01.946\nThat's important.\n\n205\n00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:05.399\nJust going into a command line, and\ntyping host name to find the machine name.\n\n206\n00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.830\nThat would be an example\nof non-volatile data.\n\n207\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.480\nSo, there's many ways that we can\ncapture non-volatile information in\n\n208\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.513\na Windows system, in a Linux system as\nwell, ifconfig to check the IP address.\n\n209\n00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:21.724\nAnd the Linux system would give us\npotentially volatile or nonvolatile data.\n\n210\n00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:26.615\nIt would depend on whether that IP\naddress is stats or dynamically issued,\n\n211\n00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:31.119\nthe HCP versus a standard or\nmanual information that's been entered\n\n212\n00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:35.715\nby either us or perhaps assigned\nthrough a reservation through DHCP.\n\n213\n00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:39.292\nOur MAC address would be considered\nnon-volatile, traditionally.\n\n214\n00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:41.375\nSo we could look up the MAC address.\n\n215\n00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:45.542\nYou could look up the file structure\nby doing a directory command.\n\n216\n00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:49.593\nThings like, those kinds of examples\nwould be considered traditionally\n\n217\n00:10:49.593 --> 00:10:51.300\nnon-volatile information.\n\n218\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.463\nWhat programs are in the system.\n\n219\n00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:54.301\nWhat's installed.\n\n220\n00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:56.294\nWhere, how big is the hard drive.\n\n221\n00:10:56.294 --> 00:11:00.032\nThese are all pieces of information\nthat tend not to change once we begin to\n\n222\n00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:01.369\ninvestigate the system.\n\n223\n00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.279\nThey're non-volatile.\n\n224\n00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:05.407\nPower cycling system will\nnot affect the directory,\n\n225\n00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:07.708\nthe install directory of the program.\n\n226\n00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:11.932\nWill not affect the Mac address\nof the machine traditionally,\n\n227\n00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:14.334\nunless there's malware, right?\n\n228\n00:11:14.334 --> 00:11:19.110\nSomething that may be operating, that\nmay be designed to delete information or\n\n229\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.546\ndesigned to modify it.\n\n230\n00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.624\nIf a certain keystroke is not entered,\nwe call this a logic bomb, right?\n\n231\n00:11:23.624 --> 00:11:24.503\nTraditionally.\n\n232\n00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:26.205\nSo there are things that\nmay get in the way of this.\n\n233\n00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:27.940\nAs investigators who\nhave to be aware of this,\n\n234\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.814\nwe have to tiptoe through the minefield,\nright?\n\n235\n00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:33.172\nThe minesweeper example\nthat we often talk about.\n\n236\n00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:38.079\nBut in general, this is the kind of\ncategorical information we're looking for.\n\n237\n00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:39.583\nWindows memory analysis.\n\n238\n00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:40.979\nWindows registry analysis.\n\n239\n00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:42.742\nWe'd be looking at a memory dump.\n\n240\n00:11:42.742 --> 00:11:44.905\nHow do we get the volatile memory?\n\n241\n00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:46.860\nWe have tools that will let us do that.\n\n242\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.919\nWindows registry now.\n\n243\n00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:52.192\nLet's just look at the registry,\nyou know regedit, regedit32, simple,\n\n244\n00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:54.729\nbuilt-in Windows tools, easily accessed.\n\n245\n00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.759\nYou could see here, I've got\nthe registry editor for Windows and\n\n246\n00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.926\nWindows 10 loaded up.\n\n247\n00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:01.697\nI'm looking at one of\nthe registry keys here,\n\n248\n00:12:01.697 --> 00:12:05.035\nas you can see, I'm inside the,\nif we go all the way up,\n\n249\n00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:08.750\nI'm inside the current controls\ncenter in HQ local machine.\n\n250\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:13.584\nIn services, looking at the other shares\nthat are mounted under layman's server,\n\n251\n00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:14.750\nfor instance here.\n\n252\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.075\nTo see if this machine, this Windows 10\nmachine I'm displaying against right now,\n\n253\n00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:19.915\nhas any shares.\n\n254\n00:12:19.915 --> 00:12:23.076\nAnd if they are there, I wanna know\nabout them as an investigator.\n\n255\n00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.173\nThis is the register key\nthat I can use to do that.\n\n256\n00:12:25.173 --> 00:12:27.789\nNow, could I use a net\ncommand to see the shares?\n\n257\n00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.941\nI could do that, there's a lot\nof ways to get this information.\n\n258\n00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:32.486\nBut the registry would\nallow me to go in and\n\n259\n00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:35.990\nkind of view it almost like\na read only information grab.\n\n260\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.074\nI'll see it, as long as I don't\nmake any changes in there.\n\n261\n00:12:38.074 --> 00:12:41.394\nAs long as I'm aware of my\ncapability to modify the system but\n\n262\n00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:45.706\nif I don't do that I'm really just\nread-onlying information looking at it.\n\n263\n00:12:45.706 --> 00:12:49.798\nBut this is one of the many registered\nkeys we'll show you, talk about throughout\n\n264\n00:12:49.798 --> 00:12:53.667\nthese episodes around the Windows OS\nforensics and OS forensics in general.\n\n265\n00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:56.575\nAnd we'll talk about a series of\nregistered keys that are valuable for\n\n266\n00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.000\nyou as an investigator to be aware of,\nthis is one of them.\n\n267\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.358\nSo we could use the regedit or\nregedit32 tools.\n\n268\n00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:06.145\nThere are other tools we could use,\nfor instance, if we go in here,\n\n269\n00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:08.879\njust into my demo environment for\njust a moment.\n\n270\n00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:13.366\nAnd we take a look at,\namong the many tools that are here,\n\n271\n00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:17.025\nlet me just bring up,\njust give me one second.\n\n272\n00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:19.547\nAnd let me bring up the OS forensics tool.\n\n273\n00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:22.238\nJust making sure that I have the right\ntool, since I have so many opened.\n\n274\n00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:23.738\nBut one of the things we can do here,\n\n275\n00:13:23.738 --> 00:13:25.995\nthis is a tool that we can\ndelve into a little bit more.\n\n276\n00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:28.259\nBut we're talking about memory analysis,\nfor instance, right?\n\n277\n00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.893\nSo in here I could go\nto the memory viewer.\n\n278\n00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:35.583\nJust double-click on that and I can load\nthe live memory of the system into this\n\n279\n00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:38.010\ntool and I can look at it right from here.\n\n280\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.060\nNow we have other tools that will let\nus capture an image of memory and\n\n281\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.299\nthen look at them offline.\n\n282\n00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:45.829\nWe've looked at some already with some of\nthe image viewing tools in the hard drive\n\n283\n00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:48.450\ndiscussions, we'll talk about\nsome others at some point.\n\n284\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.742\nBut I can go in here and I can dump the\nphysical memory and create a dump file of\n\n285\n00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:57.391\nthe physical memory in real time from\nhere, forensically sound manner to do so.\n\n286\n00:13:57.391 --> 00:14:00.462\nSave the crash thumb files so\nI can then read it offline.\n\n287\n00:14:00.462 --> 00:14:02.389\nSo this is the OS forensics tool, right?\n\n288\n00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:05.839\nThis is a tool that's a very\npowerful set of tools for Windows.\n\n289\n00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.472\nWe'll talk about a bunch of different\nfunctionality in here in a couple of\n\n290\n00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:09.285\ndifferent episodes.\n\n291\n00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:10.767\nWe'll demo some things but,\n\n292\n00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:14.687\nyou could see here I'm actually looking\nat the general process information.\n\n293\n00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:18.455\nIt tells me what the virtual memory and\nphysical memory working sets are,\n\n294\n00:14:18.455 --> 00:14:21.640\nhow much memory I have assigned\nto the machine in other words.\n\n295\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.022\nAnd then it let's me\nlook at the memory space.\n\n296\n00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:26.812\nI actually see the layout\nof the memory space.\n\n297\n00:14:26.812 --> 00:14:31.505\nSo I could see the overall address ranges,\nthe type of memory, is it private,\n\n298\n00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.511\nis it swapped, is it mapped etc.\n\n299\n00:14:33.511 --> 00:14:37.231\nWhat protection is available,\nread write not available, read only,\n\n300\n00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:38.291\nthat kind of thing.\n\n301\n00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:41.053\nI could see the kinds\nof memory that it is.\n\n302\n00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:43.529\nI could see the actual memory\nlayout on the map as well.\n\n303\n00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:47.499\nSo I can just see what color-coded\ninformation is in the sense that it says,\n\n304\n00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:51.235\nokay, this is preserved, this is private,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n305\n00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:56.137\nIt's a very simplistic way of looking\nat memory, but the idea is that I\n\n306\n00:14:56.137 --> 00:15:01.138\ncan then go in, grab as you could see\none of the specific memory spaces.\n\n307\n00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:05.752\nI can dump that memory space to disk,\nso I can selectively go in and grab or\n\n308\n00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:09.776\ncarve as we often talk about a piece\nof memory of the memory map.\n\n309\n00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:13.073\nI could take that memory map,\ncarve it out and I can look at it.\n\n310\n00:15:13.073 --> 00:15:18.303\nI could export this list out to CSV so\nI can create my documentation.\n\n311\n00:15:18.303 --> 00:15:21.134\nAnd this tool allows me to open a case,\nright?\n\n312\n00:15:21.134 --> 00:15:24.285\nWe were just down in one of the tools,\nbut I can set up a case,\n\n313\n00:15:24.285 --> 00:15:27.059\njust like I do with the access\nFDK forensic tool kit,\n\n314\n00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:30.618\ntool that we've talked about,\nwe'll talk about it again later.\n\n315\n00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:34.020\nWith Autopsy, another tool that you've\neither heard me mention already or\n\n316\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.466\nwe'll see in future episodes.\n\n317\n00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:37.797\nThere's a lot of different\ncase management tools.\n\n318\n00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:39.062\nEnd Case, right?\n\n319\n00:15:39.062 --> 00:15:40.232\nWe talked about that,\n\n320\n00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:43.938\nprobably the premiere forensic case\nmanagement tool out there today.\n\n321\n00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:46.335\nWe've demoed to talk about many of these,\nright?\n\n322\n00:15:46.335 --> 00:15:49.165\nBut we can use OS\nforensics to open a case.\n\n323\n00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:52.034\nRemember a case is nothing more\nthan just a file with a bunch of\n\n324\n00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:56.331\nmetadata describing various artifacts,\npieces of evidence, traditionally, right?\n\n325\n00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.303\nThat we find and we put in, And so\nthis tool, among many others, can be used.\n\n326\n00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:03.559\nThis is one that's specific to Windows,\nhas a bunch of tools,\n\n327\n00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.315\nobviously easy to deploy in use.\n\n328\n00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:08.288\n30-day demo trial,\nthat's what I'm using it with.\n\n329\n00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:09.975\nYou pay, go out and license.\n\n330\n00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:12.410\nYou get a full enterprise quote,\nunquote license for it so\n\n331\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.730\nit could be used beyond the 30-day window.\n\n332\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.730\nAll the tools, we try the demo and use for\nyou here and recommend to use so you can\n\n333\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.750\nuse in your practice environment so\nyou can do some hands-on like we're doing.\n\n334\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.580\nTry to find free versions for you.\n\n335\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.970\nBut tools that would commonly be used\nby forensic investigators in the field,\n\n336\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.230\nlet you at least have\na sense of what they are.\n\n337\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.812\nYou may or may not go out and\nlicense them, but\n\n338\n00:16:32.812 --> 00:16:35.320\nyou can usually download them and\nuse them for free for a period of time.\n\n339\n00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.154\nSo, we try to do that for you here because\nyou should have that capability, right?\n\n340\n00:16:40.154 --> 00:16:41.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's always important to do,\n\n341\n00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:42.350\nto play around with.\n\n342\n00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.810\nSo OS forensics, right,\na good tool that maybe helpful\n\n343\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.890\nto do a memory dump right here\nwithin Windows generically.\n\n344\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.860\nWe could do a raw device or raw disk view.\n\n345\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.890\nWe can actually create a DD image and\nor dump one and mount one and\n\n346\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.880\ntake a look at it.\n\n347\n00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.500\nWe can mount SQL images, right?\n\n348\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.209\nSo SQLite, we'll take a look in the\nupcoming database forensics conversations\n\n349\n00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:01.800\nabout how to play with databases.\n\n350\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.660\nAnd I'll show you how to take\na sample database, mount it, and\n\n351\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.850\nexamine it with a database u.\n\n352\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:07.520\nIt's just another one that can be used.\n\n353\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.300\nSame thing with the web forensics.\n\n354\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.047\nSame things with thumbnail cache,\nESD, ESCDB forensics.\n\n355\n00:17:13.047 --> 00:17:16.205\nFor instance, I know it's kind of hard to\nsee, it's behind my picture right there.\n\n356\n00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.720\nBut we have all sorts of stuff.\n\n357\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.580\nFor instance, do you know that Windows 10,\nour favorite OS of the day,\n\n358\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.480\nWindows 10, IE, or\nnot IE 10, the Edge browser\n\n359\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.480\nstores its data in the ESC format, as\nopposed to the more traditional formats.\n\n360\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.060\nAnd so we're using a database\nthat is very similar\n\n361\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.210\nto some of the other Microsoft products.\n\n362\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.880\nAnd so now we have to use a special kind\nof viewer to be able to get to that data.\n\n363\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.030\nSo there's just things that\nyou'd want to know about and\n\n364\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.450\nbe aware of and obviously tools like\nthis may give you that advantage, right?\n\n365\n00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.880\nSo these are the kind of things we'd\nbe thinking about when we go in and\n\n366\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.380\nstart doing memory and registry analysis.\n\n367\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.810\nCache, cookie history analysis,\n\n368\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.690\nwe just talked about how to do\nsome of that, some of those tools.\n\n369\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.500\nWindows file analysis, metadata,\nand of course event log analysis.\n\n370\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.334\nWe'll have a tool In here, I'll take\na look at this again with you in a bit but\n\n371\n00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.180\nevent logs.\n\n372\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.680\nI'll just minimize this.\n\n373\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.160\nWe can bring up a tool like this,\n\n374\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.150\nthe event log of your and so\nwe always bring up the information.\n\n375\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.260\nSo you could see their\nEvent Log Explorer rather, excuse me.\n\n376\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.800\nThinking about a different tool.\n\n377\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.110\nBut I have it up on the screen so\n\n378\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.570\nDaniel will be able to just make\nsure he has the right information.\n\n379\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.760\nIt's what we always do, we just throw\nthe tool name up there for you.\n\n380\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.350\nSo Event Log Explorer.\n\n381\n00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.220\nAgain, free tool evaluation copy.\n\n382\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.480\n30 days, you can get a licensed copy after\nthat but you can download and use it.\n\n383\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.120\nSo this tool, it's essentially just\na glorified log explorer, right,\n\n384\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.400\njust like you could use\nEvent Viewer in Windows.\n\n385\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.120\nBut the difference is, we're able to mount\nall the logs from the local machine.\n\n386\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.360\nJust gives us a little\nmore capability here.\n\n387\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.400\nCome out in different logs.\n\n388\n00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.260\nWe got the application log set,\nsecurity logs.\n\n389\n00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.930\nSo I can go in, I can pull up any one\nof those log files, I can filter.\n\n390\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.430\nAs you can see, I can copy,\nI can bookmark, you'll see here.\n\n391\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.720\nI can grab a bunch of information,\nI can color code.\n\n392\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.360\nSo I can do an investigation.\n\n393\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.240\nKinda color code and\ntrack the different files, which is nice.\n\n394\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.170\nI can look at properties,\nso I can delve in.\n\n395\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.020\nI see each entry down here,\nwith description.\n\n396\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.652\nI see the actual data,\nin either DWORD, WORD, or\n\n397\n00:19:16.652 --> 00:19:20.382\nBYTE form depending on what we're doing,\nright?\n\n398\n00:19:20.382 --> 00:19:21.508\nThese are just successor audits.\n\n399\n00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:24.590\nThere's probably not a lot of\ndata associated with these.\n\n400\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:29.365\nBut you know, you can see if we go in, we\nlook at application, we may get more data\n\n401\n00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:34.233\njust depending on [INAUDIBLE] information,\ndepending on what we're looking at.\n\n402\n00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:37.168\nBut we can pull up an individual one,\nbring it out,\n\n403\n00:19:37.168 --> 00:19:40.670\nyou know we could see just\nthe information that may be there.\n\n404\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.640\nWe could look up in the Event ID\ndatabase or Microsoft Knowledge Base,\n\n405\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.090\nwe have links to external\ncapabilities to find the data or\n\n406\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.250\nfind out more about it if there is data.\n\n407\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.570\nWe can look at the raw data in XML view.\n\n408\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:01.390\nAnd that's just IE, the protected\nIE on the system I'm running.\n\n409\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.237\nYou can see the XML view\nof data right there.\n\n410\n00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:06.984\nSo we can take a look and\nsee what information, again,\n\n411\n00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:10.810\nas a forensic investigator this would\nobviously be beneficial for us.\n\n412\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.450\nWe could see the history\nof where somebody's been,\n\n413\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.140\nwhat they've been doing by\nlog entry on the system.\n\n414\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.600\nPull all these log files out.\n\n415\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.660\nWe obviously wouldn't do\nthis on a live system.\n\n416\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.110\nWe'd capture all this data.\n\n417\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.450\nLook at it offline in\na forensically sound manner.\n\n418\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.270\nBut we literally can tell the story of\nwhere the user's been, what they've\n\n419\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.806\nbeen doing, time-stamped moment by moment\nthroughout a 24 hour, 48 hour, however\n\n420\n00:20:31.806 --> 00:20:35.529\nlong that cycle is that we're zeroing\nin on for the incident in question.\n\n421\n00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:38.080\nWe have all the documentary\nevidence that's there, and\n\n422\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.310\nwe can cross reference it.\n\n423\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.250\nSo tools like this become helpful,\nnot because you can't do this in the OS\n\n424\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.630\nitself, but these tools give us more\ncapabilities within the dataset.\n\n425\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.430\nInstead of having to go to Event Viewer,\ncopying down event IDs, going out and\n\n426\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.200\nparsing them separately with Google or\nwhatever we may do to find it.\n\n427\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.080\nYou don't see the raw XML data depending\non what version of Event Viewer you're\n\n428\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.900\nworking with.\n\n429\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.340\nNow we have all those tools in one place.\n\n430\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.862\nSo I can call the code,\na certain kind of files or\n\n431\n00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:06.207\ncertain kind of entry\nby applying a filter.\n\n432\n00:21:06.207 --> 00:21:09.255\nAnd I can group them together,\nexport that list, and\n\n433\n00:21:09.255 --> 00:21:12.574\nessentially have a filtered copy\nof the data in that log and\n\n434\n00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:17.610\nstart building my referenceable exhibits,\nmy artifacts for the evidence gathering.\n\n435\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.730\nSo this is the kind of stuff we'd\nbe doing with event log analysis.\n\n436\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.460\nAnd these are the tools that we\nwill use in order to do this.\n\n437\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.180\nSo understanding the methodology,\nvery, very important for\n\n438\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.120\nus to focus in on or zero in on and\nhave a better sense of.\n\n439\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.090\nWhat about some common stuff,\njust some information?\n\n440\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.540\nAs you can see here, I have some different\nthings listed here that may be helpful.\n\n441\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.950\nWe talked about system date and\ntime before.\n\n442\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.360\nIf we go into our command line here.\n\n443\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.630\nLet me just clear the screen here in\nWindows just so we can take a look, right?\n\n444\n00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.510\nSo if we go in and we do time or date.\n\n445\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.620\nAnd if we do time, and you'll see that,\nif we just do time we're\n\n446\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.720\nactually prompted to be able to set\nthe time date, prompted to set the date.\n\n447\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.140\nWe don't wanna do that cuz\nwe could obviously then\n\n448\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.330\nmanage to reset the system without meaning\nto and that would screw up all the data.\n\n449\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.290\nSo we have to be very careful when\nwe use these commands in Windows.\n\n450\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.980\nBut time/t right is a little bit\ndifferent because what that does\n\n451\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.520\nIs it allows us to see the current time\nwithout being prompted to reset, right?\n\n452\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.752\nSo I'd wanna know the system time.\n\n453\n00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:23.322\nI'd wanna do the same thing with dates,\nright?\n\n454\n00:22:23.322 --> 00:22:30.030\nSo date/t and we can see the current\ndate and time on the system.\n\n455\n00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.556\nSo these are important Windows commands,\nequivalent in Linux, or\n\n456\n00:22:33.556 --> 00:22:37.440\nthe equivalent in any OS we want\nto know about and they're simple.\n\n457\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.760\nYou may sit there and say, well how hard\nwould it be to figure out the date and\n\n458\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.440\ntime, can't I just look at the calendar,\nthe clock or whatever it is?\n\n459\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.530\nYeah, of course you could.\n\n460\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.120\nThere's more than one way to get this but\n\n461\n00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.990\nmy point is you want to\nforensically examine the system.\n\n462\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.680\nMaybe the system clock's been modified.\n\n463\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.170\nMaybe the time is off.\n\n464\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.700\nMaybe the time zone is different.\n\n465\n00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.860\nThat would be valuable to know\nbecause maybe somebody has manipulated\n\n466\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.260\nthe time stamping capability of\nthe system by modifying its system clock.\n\n467\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.890\nSo the time stamps are not accurate or are\noffset to a different timezone to make it\n\n468\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.580\nappear as if things happened at a certain\npoint in time when they did not.\n\n469\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.380\nWe may be messing around\nwith the use of NTP and\n\n470\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.690\ntime synchronization across the network.\n\n471\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.300\nAnd again there may be a broader\ncontext for the investigation.\n\n472\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.010\nThere may be more things involved,\nmore systems we have to examine.\n\n473\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.470\nWe have to cast a wider net.\n\n474\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.020\nAnd we have to be thinking about this\nas we start to examine a system.\n\n475\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.530\nSo beginning by examining\nthe core data in the system and\n\n476\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:37.200\nthen moving out concentric circles or\nexamining additional systems beyond this\n\n477\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720\none allows us to build that analogy and\nunderstand more about what's happening.\n\n478\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.490\nAnd it may be simple, so\nsimple sometimes we overlook it.\n\n479\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.500\nHow often do you sit\ndown at your computer and\n\n480\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.810\nactually stop to ponder,\nhey what time is it?\n\n481\n00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.506\nAnd is my system the right time?\n\n482\n00:23:50.506 --> 00:23:54.418\nYou don't really care, I mean even if it's\nout of time, typically the sense that\n\n483\n00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:58.216\nit's off sync, unless you're logged into\na Windows domain and Kerberos is not\n\n484\n00:23:58.216 --> 00:24:01.641\nbehaving itself because of a time\nsync issue, what we call time drift.\n\n485\n00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.795\nOr your VM is not synchronized because\nof time drift You don't even pay\n\n486\n00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:05.600\nattention to it.\n\n487\n00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.598\nWe just don't care.\n\n488\n00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:08.405\nBut the reality is as investigators,\n\n489\n00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:11.906\nthat's one of the most important things\nthat we see is that kinda behavior\n\n490\n00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:14.840\nindicates there's definitely\nsomething unusual.\n\n491\n00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.980\nAnd something unusual is the exact,\nand we wanna be able to tell, or\n\n492\n00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.960\nto be able to tell a story about.\n\n493\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.410\nSo we may look at arp cache data.\n\n494\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.175\narp -a, look at all the information.\n\n495\n00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:30.284\nAnd what you'll see there is a listing\nof IPs and Mac addresses, and\n\n496\n00:24:30.284 --> 00:24:31.630\nphysical address.\n\n497\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.660\nMac address,\njust you know how it's referenced.\n\n498\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.301\nBut is the ability to understand\nan IP address, and a Mac address, and\n\n499\n00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:41.255\nspecifically the communication path,\nthat links those two together, and\n\n500\n00:24:41.255 --> 00:24:44.058\nwhere they came from is\nthat important information.\n\n501\n00:24:44.058 --> 00:24:46.696\nIt will be very important information for\nus on this machine,\n\n502\n00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:50.060\nobviously the static entries are the ones\nthat are gonna be there all the time.\n\n503\n00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.450\nThere part of the built in information,\nthat is just put into the arp system,\n\n504\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.690\nor the arp cache in this case,\nso it's their startup.\n\n505\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.370\nBut all the dynamic information,\n\n506\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.730\nis what's been resolved as\nwe've been using the system.\n\n507\n00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.657\nSo you can see, I've got a bunch of\ndifferent IP addresses from different\n\n508\n00:25:07.657 --> 00:25:13.030\nsubnets, potentially from different\nnetworks, 0.10, 0.13, 0.14, 1.01.\n\n509\n00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.885\nThese may all be on the same\nsubnet if I have a class C,\n\n510\n00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:23.350\na /24, excuse me,\n[INAUDIBLE] slash 24 subnet, I\n\n511\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.880\nwould be seeing all of these as being part\nof the same network, but it's hard to say.\n\n512\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.073\nWe don't have the subnet mask.\n\n513\n00:25:28.073 --> 00:25:32.341\nWe know for sure that it seems I've got\na bunch of traffic from different machines\n\n514\n00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:34.910\nwith potentially different IP addresses.\n\n515\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.622\nBut I would wanna note all this.\n\n516\n00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:39.310\nI wanna take this MAC addresses,\nthis IP addresses.\n\n517\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.890\nI'd wanna now go examine in a broader\nway every machine that's listed here.\n\n518\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:44.820\nWhere are they coming from?\n\n519\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.320\nWhat are they do?\n\n520\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.870\nWhy we're they connecting to me?\n\n521\n00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.740\nWhy was I connected to them?\n\n522\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.540\nWhat information is available there?\n\n523\n00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.520\nWho owns that machine?\n\n524\n00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.990\nIs it a log on that I can verify that took\nplace at a certain time from me to them?\n\n525\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.140\nFrom them to me?\n\n526\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.011\nThis is where we start correlating\nevidence between log files and\n\n527\n00:26:00.011 --> 00:26:01.116\nthe information we see.\n\n528\n00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:03.340\nAnd this could grow exponentially.\n\n529\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.920\nBecome very broad very quickly.\n\n530\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.960\nIf I have 100 machines on this list,\nI got to eliminate all those machines.\n\n531\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.440\nI gotta find out why every\nconnection took place and\n\n532\n00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.470\nwhy it is sitting here referenceable\nin this cache right here.\n\n533\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.310\nSo there's a lot of information\nboth dynamically and\n\n534\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.160\nstatically that I wanna look at.\n\n535\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.640\nI may wanna look at nbstat.\n\n536\n00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.800\nAnd I'd want to take a look at,\n\n537\n00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.220\nI don't have any information\nin the cache right now.\n\n538\n00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.820\nAnd I'd wanna be able to see,\nshouldn't have any information anyway.\n\n539\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.900\nYeah, there's nothing there.\n\n540\n00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.240\nI'd wanna be able to see what is here.\n\n541\n00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.150\nI'd cross-reference\nthe nbtstat with the arp cache.\n\n542\n00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.450\nBecause I'd wanna see if those machines\nhad been talked to recently and\n\n543\n00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.090\nif they were still sitting in the cache.\n\n544\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.810\nKnowing the timeout value\nof data in the cache,\n\n545\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.230\nI can see whether those\nconnections were recent or not.\n\n546\n00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.320\nBecause in theory,\nif they were there in the last maybe 10,\n\n547\n00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.150\n15 minutes if they were active,they\nwould still be in the cache.\n\n548\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.168\nBeyond that, at about ten minutes or so,\nthey start to disappear from the cache.\n\n549\n00:27:01.168 --> 00:27:04.921\nOn average the time value for\na lot of these caches is 600 seconds or\n\n550\n00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.590\n10 minutes as we count down in windows.\n\n551\n00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.270\nJust that piece of information alone tells\nme those IP addresses in the arp cache.\n\n552\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.753\nAlthough I've talked to them at some point\nwhen this machine was powered on and\n\n553\n00:27:15.753 --> 00:27:18.971\nthe machine has not been powered off\nsince I did that because they would be\n\n554\n00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:19.498\nwiped out,\n\n555\n00:27:19.498 --> 00:27:23.181\ntells me I haven't talked to them recently\ncuz there's nothing in the arp cache.\n\n556\n00:27:23.181 --> 00:27:27.358\nSo in other words, excuse me, nothing in\nthe net bios cache which means I haven't\n\n557\n00:27:27.358 --> 00:27:29.778\nresolved the host names or\nthe net bios names for\n\n558\n00:27:29.778 --> 00:27:34.160\nthose machines in the last 15 to 20\nminutes of usage or they would be here.\n\n559\n00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.090\nSo that would be helpful to know.\n\n560\n00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.020\nAgain, just putting together\npieces of the puzzle.\n\n561\n00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.443\nNet stat, I wanna take a look at\ncurrent network statistics, look at\n\n562\n00:27:43.443 --> 00:27:48.648\ninformation about inbound and outbound\nconnections, ports, and protocols.\n\n563\n00:27:48.648 --> 00:27:52.510\nSo UDP, TCP, what's active,\nwhat ports are being used.\n\n564\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.460\nSo let's just scroll back up here.\n\n565\n00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.625\nAnd so, we can see that I have a bunch of\nconnections that are listening states.\n\n566\n00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:03.140\nSomething's waiting to happen, but\nI've also got a few that are established.\n\n567\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.602\nI am connected out to a bunch\nof webpages right now.\n\n568\n00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:08.150\nSo I've bunch of webpages\nloaded up as we often do.\n\n569\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.030\nDemo things for you.\n\n570\n00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:13.040\nSo I would expect to see some of\nthese in established states, and\n\n571\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.030\nI would expect to see various ports\nassociated with those connections outbound\n\n572\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.850\nto be able to connect out to those.\n\n573\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:19.870\nSo that would be normal.\n\n574\n00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.620\nBut again, what am I looking for here?\n\n575\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.973\nI'm looking for open ports and\ncross referencing against inbound or\n\n576\n00:28:24.973 --> 00:28:28.222\noutbound IPs that are unusual that\nwould be on that arp cache list.\n\n577\n00:28:28.222 --> 00:28:30.406\nI wanna see who's been\nconnected to my machine and\n\n578\n00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:32.210\nif there's a hidden connection.\n\n579\n00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.899\nSome sort of map I'm unaware of.\n\n580\n00:28:33.899 --> 00:28:35.587\nI would wanna look at the shares.\n\n581\n00:28:35.587 --> 00:28:37.260\nAnd we already did that\nin the registry key.\n\n582\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.790\nBut I'd probably wanna do that\nfrom the command line and\n\n583\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.980\nsee if there are shares open.\n\n584\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.310\nI'm mapped to a drive.\n\n585\n00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.330\nI should see evidence of that.\n\n586\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.327\nThat could explain some of\nthe arp cache information.\n\n587\n00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:49.635\nSo there's a lot of ways to cross\nreference this data and walk it through.\n\n588\n00:28:49.635 --> 00:28:51.275\nBut this is the beginning and\n\n589\n00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:55.115\nagain as they said in The Mummy,\ndeath is just the beginning.\n\n590\n00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:59.725\nSo it's just the beginning of our journey\nbecause there's so much information\n\n591\n00:28:59.725 --> 00:29:03.825\nthat we have to capture and we have to\nreference in each one of these steps.\n\n592\n00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:07.755\nEach of these eight methodological areas\nand then the information about it.\n\n593\n00:29:07.755 --> 00:29:10.640\nYou've just seen some examples\nof volatile information.\n\n594\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.530\nNet session, net file, open file.\n\n595\n00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.960\nThese are all commands.\n\n596\n00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.100\nI showed you nbtstat, netstat.\n\n597\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.480\nThese are commands that will help\nus to look at volatile information.\n\n598\n00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.670\nWe'll be walking through\nother sections and\n\n599\n00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:29.670\nother methodology points and other tools\nthroughout our conversations in this area.\n\n600\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.860\nIt's really just the foundation right\njust beginning to lay down some of\n\n601\n00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.770\nthe knowledge.\n\n602\n00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.095\nGiving you a taste, and showing you how\nwe could use several tools quickly.\n\n603\n00:29:37.095 --> 00:29:39.480\nBuilt-in tools, tools that are free,\nthat are there.\n\n604\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.940\nJust to quickly correlate and\nstart to call some information, and\n\n605\n00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.435\nin our minds develop a plan.\n\n606\n00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:48.282\nA thought process of how broad, and how\nwide that net needs to be that we're gonna\n\n607\n00:29:48.282 --> 00:29:52.018\ncatch, or rather we're gonna throw out\nto try to catch information with, and\n\n608\n00:29:52.018 --> 00:29:54.930\nhow much investigative work\nwe're gonna have to do.\n\n609\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.590\nBecause it's not the one\nmachine we're investigating.\n\n610\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.240\nIt'd be great if we came up and\nsaid, hey, it's in response,\n\n611\n00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.650\nthis machine, and we're done.\n\n612\n00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.640\nThis is the starting point,\nbut it's what ripples out from\n\n613\n00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.610\nhere that encompasses all\nthe machines that we connected with.\n\n614\n00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.770\nThat were used to connect to this machine.\n\n615\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.620\nIn other words, this is patient zero,\nas we would say.\n\n616\n00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.563\nIf you're looking at a plot to be\nable to track a disease of some kind.\n\n617\n00:30:17.563 --> 00:30:21.797\nSo this is where it ultimately was that\nwe had all the information being used,\n\n618\n00:30:21.797 --> 00:30:26.228\nthis is where the activities took place\nbut all the contributory factors that led\n\n619\n00:30:26.228 --> 00:30:30.620\nto the attack that took place here have\nto be examined, all those pathways.\n\n620\n00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.997\nAnd what we're doing is quickly\ntrying to map out what those are.\n\n621\n00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.400\nAnd then, we're gonna start exploring.\n\n622\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.270\nAnd that's really the first\nstep in our journey.\n\n623\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, like you said, this is\na very large topic of conversation.\n\n624\n00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.100\nThere's a lot of goings on that we\nhave to be able to take a look at and\n\n625\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.710\neven understand and\ngather information for.\n\n626\n00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.322\nBut we are out of time for this episode so\nwe are gonna have to approach this like\n\n627\n00:30:51.322 --> 00:30:54.001\nyou do eating an elephant as they say,\none bite at a time.\n\n628\n00:30:54.001 --> 00:30:55.234\n&gt;&gt; Tusk first.\n\n629\n00:30:55.234 --> 00:30:56.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true.\n\n630\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.248\nSo join us back for part two.\n\n631\n00:30:58.248 --> 00:31:00.969\nAs for this episode, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n632\n00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:02.920\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n633\n00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n634\n00:31:03.690 -->

You're\n\n3\n00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:13.012\nwatching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n4\n00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:13.849\nGreetings, everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.280\nWelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT PRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.360\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more in our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.040\nThat's version nine for\nthose of you out there keeping score.\n\n9\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.280\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our heaviest hitter we have\n\n10\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.460\nin that endeavor,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.317\nAdam, glad to have you again, man.\n\n12\n00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:32.590\nHow's it goin?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.220\nGood to be here, glad to be back.\n\n14\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.961\nGlad to be continuing to talk with you and\nyou and all of you wherever you are.\n\n15\n00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.618\nOver there.\n\n16\n00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.678\n&gt;&gt; I think there's some\npeople in the elevator.\n\n17\n00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:42.980\n&gt;&gt; They could be back there as well.\n\n18\n00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.712\nThey could be sneaking around\nthe corner when we're talking.\n\n19\n00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:48.020\n[LAUGH] Glad to be here\nto talk with all of you.\n\n20\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.250\nPart 2 about operating system forensics.\n\n21\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.490\nSo much to talk about, so much to say.\n\n22\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.250\nThis is going to be broader\nthan just a Part 2,\n\n23\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.020\nas you probably have already guessed.\n\n24\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.260\nWe're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n25\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100\nWe were talking about the gathering among\nthe many methodological steps involved.\n\n26\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.480\nVolatile and non-volatile data,\nmemory information,\n\n27\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.570\nthe registry, the metadata, we're walking\nthrough that forensic methodology.\n\n28\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.390\nWe started talking about some of\nthe volatile tool kits and things we could\n\n29\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340\nuse and mechanisms or methodology steps\nwe may follow to gather volatile data.\n\n30\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.530\nAnd we left off really just\ntalking about the basics.\n\n31\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.000\nLooked at some of the name\nresolution caches.\n\n32\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.030\nLooked at how it could gather and\n\n33\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.890\ncorrelate some of that\ndata around access times.\n\n34\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.020\nAnd start to explore the ways we can\nuse that data as an investigator.\n\n35\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.770\nWant to delve back into that,\ntalk about process IDs, what we call PIDs,\n\n36\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.670\na little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.930\nTalk about a tool we already\ntalked about next step but\n\n38\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.990\nuse some switches you may not have\nseen yet to correlate the process and\n\n39\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.070\nthe network connection data in one place.\n\n40\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.720\nYou may or\n\n41\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740\nmay not be aware of the fact that netstat\nlets us actually see the process IDs.\n\n42\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.180\nAnd, with an O switch or an F port switch,\nwe actually can load the routing table and\n\n43\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.830\neverything else as part\nof that dump all at once.\n\n44\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.050\nSo we're gonna take a look at that and\nshow you how that works.\n\n45\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.870\nSo if you wanna join me back over here\non the machine, let's continue talking.\n\n46\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.820\nYou'll process information, really so\nimportant to know what's running.\n\n47\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.570\nWe talked about the fact that we can\nuse something like Process Explorer for\n\n48\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.310\ninstance as a tool that may be available,\nbut we have a lot of other tools here.\n\n49\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.610\nTools that are built into the OS\nobviously important to think about.\n\n50\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.960\nI like task list a lot.\n\n51\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.420\nIt's one that's built right in.\n\n52\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170\nA lot of people overlook it,\ndon't even realize it's there.\n\n53\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.650\nSo let's just take a look here.\n\n54\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550\nTask list, again, if you're not familiar\nwith the command, as I've often encouraged\n\n55\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.710\nyou to do, take a look at the help\nfob before you start playing with it.\n\n56\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.410\nLoad it up, see what it does.\n\n57\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.730\nBut you can see there's a lot of\nswitches associated with task list here.\n\n58\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.520\nSpecify the remote systems\nyou want to connect remotely.\n\n59\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.600\nBe able to specify a domain\ncontext if you want to do that,\n\n60\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.660\npassword, all the current modules, etc.\n\n61\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.180\nYou'll see we can display services\nhosted by process for that, for apps.\n\n62\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.150\nLet me just scroll down it and\nmove over a little bit here so\n\n63\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.390\nyou can kinda get that all\ntogether in one place.\n\n64\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.350\nSo we could do this and break it out.\n\n65\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.620\nI like to use the V switch right here for\nVerbose.\n\n66\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.660\nGives us detailed information.\n\n67\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.120\nWe could format that out\nto a certain specification.\n\n68\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.650\nWe could do column header.\n\n69\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.960\nYou know, information.\n\n70\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.290\nIt's all sorts of stuff and so\n\n71\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.350\nyou could see that we could output\nquite a bit of information here.\n\n72\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.660\nAnd so if you look at some of the examples\nof the way in which we can use this tool,\n\n73\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.110\nit becomes very valuable for us.\n\n74\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.820\nIf I just do task list minus V.\n\n75\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.050\nGet quite a bit of information\non what's running.\n\n76\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.570\nNow obviously,\nin this foreign output to the console,\n\n77\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.820\nprobably not gonna do us a lotta good.\n\n78\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.730\nBut at least you could see\nthe general thought process here.\n\n79\n00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.120\nWe're getting the image name so\nthe process name, the PID,\n\n80\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.480\nthe process ID, session name, CPU time.\n\n81\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.920\nYou obviously have to read\nthis cause it's truncated and\n\n82\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.330\nwrapped so'd you have to output this to a\nfile and then format it and work with it.\n\n83\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.040\nBut, we do have the FO command here to do\na list so if I do FO list, or FO table,\n\n84\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.750\nthere's different ways to output and\nbe able to see this.\n\n85\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.430\nSo I get the username for the information\nand what's being used here.\n\n86\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.190\nQuite a bit of information\nusing task list.\n\n87\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.360\nThis would be a great way to\ndump the security user contacts,\n\n88\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.580\nto get the full command line that\nwas being used, the process ID.\n\n89\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.210\nAll that stuff that we need\nwould be available here.\n\n90\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.380\nThere's other tools that are on that list,\nPsList, ListDLLs, handle.\n\n91\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.940\nThese are tools that you may have\nto download or get a hold of.\n\n92\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.650\nThey're not built into the OS, but\nthey do give us a lot of flexibility.\n\n93\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.470\nMany of these tools, PsList for instance,\n\n94\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.150\nListDLLs, these come to\nus from Microsoft now.\n\n95\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.380\nThey are part of the Sysinternals Toolset.\n\n96\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.820\nTalked about sysinternals before.\n\n97\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.650\nYou could certainly go out to TechNet.\n\n98\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.130\nDo a Google search for sysinternals.\n\n99\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.800\nYou'll find Mark Russinovich's set of\ntools, which are what the sysinternal tool\n\n100\n00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.350\nset is, and you'll be able to download and\nuse all of them.\n\n101\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.380\nAutoruns, very famous tool\nthat's often talked about.\n\n102\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.120\nWe demo here and have talked about.\n\n103\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.520\nWe'll talk about again in\nsome upcoming episodes.\n\n104\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.730\nBut there are many, many tools.\n\n105\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.493\nThe p-series.\n\n106\n00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:53.910\nPsList, .PsDump, all the different\ntools in that series that he made,\n\n107\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.690\nare very valuable to forensic\ninvestigators as well.\n\n108\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.730\nSo keep in mind, knowledge of the OS,\nknowledge of the tool set.\n\n109\n00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.750\nVery valuable for us.\n\n110\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.753\nI mentioned the use of netstat, right?\n\n111\n00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:05.260\n&gt;&gt; You did, actually.\n\n112\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.530\n&gt;&gt; I did, thank you for\nvalidating that, sir.\n\n113\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.560\nAppreciate that.\n\n114\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.240\nAnd I told you that looking\nat netstat is a tool, right?\n\n115\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.190\nSo, if we just look at netstat minus h,\ntraditional use.\n\n116\n00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.751\nI showed you this in the last episode.\n\n117\n00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:21.430\nIt takes a minute, builds, shows us all\nof the current inbound connections,\n\n118\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.400\nthe protocol, tcp or udp and the ports and\nthen, of course, the status.\n\n119\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.800\nSo that's pretty straightforward,\nbut if I do netstat minus O,\n\n120\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.760\nI see something a little bit different.\n\n121\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.020\nNow it takes a minute to build all this,\nso you gotta be patient with it.\n\n122\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.290\nYou could see here instead of that list,\nlet's just get down here and\n\n123\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.390\nput this up right there,\nwe can see that we do have the protocol.\n\n124\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.030\nWe can see the local address and the port.\n\n125\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.420\nWe can see the foreign address,\nwhere it is coming from, establish.\n\n126\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.060\nAll that's in the netstat minus a dump but\nit's not obvious,\n\n127\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.610\ncuz it's mixed in with\nall the other stuff.\n\n128\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.560\nYou gotta call it, number one,\nBut number two, what we get is,\n\n129\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.700\nwhich is not in the original\nnetstat minus a dump, the PID.\n\n130\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.240\nThe Process ID,\nkinda categorized over here.\n\n131\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.290\nAgain if you output this to a text file,\nyou could then work with the formatting\n\n132\n00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.060\nand get it to line up nice,\ndo a format out to a list or table.\n\n133\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.950\nThere's different ways\nto manipulate this data.\n\n134\n00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.260\nBut my point is that just raw data even\njust like this on the screen, right?\n\n135\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.290\nWe're seeing an additional, incredibly\nvaluable piece of information to cross\n\n136\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.870\nreference here, which is the PID,\nthe process ID.\n\n137\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.680\nIf we take that process ID and\n\n138\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.780\nwe come in back into our Windows 12\nserver 12R2 system here for a minute.\n\n139\n00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.990\nAnd we use a tool like this,\nwhich is Process Explorer.\n\n140\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.780\nThis is one of the tools that you can get\n\n141\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.710\neither through the sysinternals tool set\nor other toolsets that are available.\n\n142\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.350\nYou'll see process explorer.\n\n143\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.340\nThis one comes from the sysinternals\ntoolset as I suggested, but\n\n144\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.800\nthere are other versions of this\ntool that will be just as good.\n\n145\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.970\nThis is free,\none of the reasons I like this.\n\n146\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.335\nYou download this off TechNet.\n\n147\n00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.450\nTechnet.Microsoft.com.\n\n148\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.080\nJust do a search for sysinternals.\n\n149\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.520\nYou'll find it there.\n\n150\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.540\nBut process explorer, I can go in,\nI can look for the process ID.\n\n151\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.320\nI can go in and find a specific process,\n\n152\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.620\nkeeping in mind that the processes\nrunning my Windows 10 box\n\n153\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.800\nthat I'm demoing off of and the server\n12VM obviously would be different, right?\n\n154\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.540\nThey're not gonna be identical.\n\n155\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.690\nBut in the real world,\nI would map that process ID,\n\n156\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.100\nrun a tool like this to then\nfind that process obviously.\n\n157\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.300\nDrill down on it from the memory image,\nsee what's going on.\n\n158\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.080\nBut you'll see,\n\n159\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.320\nI can go in, I can work with the priority\nof the process, I can kill processes.\n\n160\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.600\nI can look at the entire tree,\n\n161\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.090\nso kill the individual instance or\nthe hierarchy of that process running.\n\n162\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.630\nI can restart, suspend.\n\n163\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.614\nMost importantly, tools like this, I can\ncreate a dump of the process memory so\n\n164\n00:07:46.614 --> 00:07:49.645\nwhen I zero in on a process,\nI want to find out whats running,\n\n165\n00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:52.397\nI could begin to use this tool or\nthe OS forensics tool.\n\n166\n00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:56.423\nI showed you in the last episode where\nI could zero in on memory blocks and\n\n167\n00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:57.842\ndump them selectively.\n\n168\n00:07:57.842 --> 00:07:59.686\nCarving them is what we call that.\n\n169\n00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:02.057\nI can file carve, I can memory carve.\n\n170\n00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:03.284\nI can process carve.\n\n171\n00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:04.693\nAll of it is the same idea.\n\n172\n00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:09.503\nI'm taking a selective chunk of that\ninformation, saving it off to a file and\n\n173\n00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:14.340\nthen working with it laterally or\nseparately right outside the system.\n\n174\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.840\nSo I can do this right from here.\n\n175\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.380\nI have the ability to go out and look and\nsee if one of the processes may be a virus\n\n176\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.940\nwith this tool that checks the VirusTotal\nwebsite, so we can go out and\n\n177\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.170\nlook for malware, right?\n\n178\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.800\nSo, that's always just a little value add.\n\n179\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.980\nI could search online and\nfind information about the process.\n\n180\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.020\nThat's easy to do,\nyou don't need this tool to do that.\n\n181\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.410\nYou could cross reference that in\na secondary machine with a browser,\n\n182\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.480\nthat's not hard to do.\n\n183\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.270\nBut, just the fact that it's kinda\nall in one place makes it a little\n\n184\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.180\nmore convenient.\n\n185\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.650\nThat's one of the reasons I like it.\n\n186\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.260\nBut the big thing I use this tool for\n\n187\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.530\nwhen I'm doing this kind of work is\ncreating these dumb files, right?\n\n188\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.610\nBecause what I want is I\nwant the process memory\n\n189\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.550\nthat's associated with that running\napplication or that running .exe.\n\n190\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.010\nI want to see what it's doing.\n\n191\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.816\nI wanna throw that into a memory\nanalyzer and I wanna understand,\n\n192\n00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:00.152\nI wanna read that hex.\n\n193\n00:09:00.152 --> 00:09:02.220\nI wanna understand what's\ngoing on in there, and\n\n194\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.150\nI want to see first-hand the information\nthat's being used and created and\n\n195\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.830\nmanipulated by one or\nmore running processes.\n\n196\n00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.860\nThis is how we delve into\nthe mysteries of what's running,\n\n197\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.590\nthis is how we find malware,\nthis is how we find root-kits.\n\n198\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.300\nThis is what we do, this is the behind the\nscenes gritty work that nobody talks about\n\n199\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.370\nthat just you grind away\nat until you figure it out.\n\n200\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.300\nAnd this is the bread and\n\n201\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.870\nbutter of the forensic investigator\ndoing this kind of work.\n\n202\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.000\n&gt;&gt; Seems really, really sexy and awesome.\n\n203\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.215\n&gt;&gt; It's incredibly exciting,\nlet me tell you.\n\n204\n00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:33.220\nI just cannot explain how excited I am.\n\n205\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.940\n&gt;&gt; You're at a ten,\nwe need you around a two.\n\n206\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI gotta dial it back just a little bit.\n\n207\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.860\nWhat about this one?\n\n208\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.770\nWhat about the F port switch with netstat,\nright?\n\n209\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.130\nI mentioned that netstat has\na variety of little hidden features.\n\n210\n00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.006\nLet's take a look at this one.\n\n211\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.940\nLet's go back up here.\n\n212\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.560\nWith NetStat when I do\nF port you'll see that\n\n213\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.250\nI'm able to pull out the information\non the routing tables.\n\n214\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.750\nNow, do I have to do that through NetStat?\n\n215\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.350\nI can do a route print and\nget the same information, right?\n\n216\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.950\nThis is not something I can't\nnecessarily do from another tool.\n\n217\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.680\nBut, my point is you can bring that\ninformation into one place and\n\n218\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.830\nbe able to work with it right here\nbecause I could see the active routes and\n\n219\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.360\nthe metrics here, right, from the IPv4 and\n\n220\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.500\nIPv6 information, which again, route\nprint would certainly give us, right?\n\n221\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.548\nThat would not be something that I\ncouldn't get somewhere else, but\n\n222\n00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:24.940\nwanna be aware of that,\nwanna be thinking about that.\n\n223\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.390\nHow can I leverage these tools,\nwhat can I do with them?\n\n224\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.360\nWe've talked about process explorer,\nlooking at process memory, PM dump,\n\n225\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.380\nuser dump, other tools on my list there.\n\n226\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.400\nYou may look at network status,\nwe talked about IP config,\n\n227\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.430\nIF config, equivalent in Linux.\n\n228\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.610\nPromiscuous detect,\nprom query for promiscuous query.\n\n229\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.100\nThese are tools that can be used to find\nout whether the system is running in\n\n230\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.242\npromiscuous mode.\n\n231\n00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:52.060\nWe've talked about promiscuous\nmode in some of our conversations.\n\n232\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.333\nI'll have some stuff to say about if\nin upcoming conversations, for instance\n\n233\n00:10:56.333 --> 00:11:00.760\nin the network forensics discussions\nwhich will come up in due course here.\n\n234\n00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.190\nTalk about a little bit in the web.\n\n235\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.530\nWe're manipulating the OSI model layer 2,\nthe DL, the data link layer.\n\n236\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.690\nWe're manipulating the MAC\naddress information specifically\n\n237\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.300\nwhen we run in promiscuous mode.\n\n238\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.855\nWe're using typically a Win P\ndump driver or Lin P Cap,\n\n239\n00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:20.865\nWin P Cap driver to turn\nthe operation of the network stack\n\n240\n00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:25.815\ninside out and accept all inbound traffic,\nmake a copy of it for monitoring purposes.\n\n241\n00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:28.125\nSo when we look at tools,\nlike Wireshark or\n\n242\n00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:31.705\nif you know it as Ethereal if you go\nback a little ways or Network Monitor,\n\n243\n00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:35.360\nwhatever tool you may use,\nto be able to capture traffic.\n\n244\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.480\nCain &amp; Abel, a good example of\nthis as well on the wireless side.\n\n245\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.220\nAll of them will typically inject the\npromiscuous mode driver into the network\n\n246\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.570\nstack, allowing them to capture all\ntraffic coming into the system,\n\n247\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.010\nmake a record of it.\n\n248\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.590\nAs opposed to ignoring traffic not\ndestined for our MAC address, our IP.\n\n249\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.790\nSo we wanna be able to be\naware of these kind of things,\n\n250\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.450\nwanna be able to know that\nthese behaviors are happening.\n\n251\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.460\nI wanna understand how they happen and\nwhy.\n\n252\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.930\nIt's very, very important for\n\n253\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.460\nus to be aware of that because\nwe're not doing those things.\n\n254\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.200\nWe're not gonna be able to\ncapture traffic properly.\n\n255\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.230\nSo it's gonna be important for\nus to think about and to be aware of.\n\n256\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.680\nWhat about the print spool files and\nthe temp files created for printing?\n\n257\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.890\nThere's so\nmuch stuff that potentially exists.\n\n258\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.970\nIn a Windows machine, you could\nprobably see the path right here.\n\n259\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.530\nSee Windows system 32 spool and\nthen printers.\n\n260\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.650\nAnd right now you're\nlooking at an empty folder.\n\n261\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.470\nThere's nothing in the print spool\nhere on this machine on Windows 10,\n\n262\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.210\non any machine for that matter by default\nunless we're printing something and\n\n263\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.960\nwe're sending it out and we're spooling it\nup then essentially processing it here.\n\n264\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.360\nI'm not doing that right now,\nso the directory is empty.\n\n265\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.280\nBut the point is, if I was I'd have to\nknow that the temporary files associated\n\n266\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.100\nwith printing would be captured here.\n\n267\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.880\nIf I do a DD image of this system,\nI would get a record of the spool files.\n\n268\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.810\nIf I do a memory dump,\n\n269\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.760\nI would get a record of what's\nin memory around the printing.\n\n270\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.820\nAnd so, if we go and\nwe look at the printer or\n\n271\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.660\nthe printer queues,\nwe could see what information is there.\n\n272\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.790\nRemember, one of the things we have to\nkeep in mind from a confidentiality\n\n273\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.580\nperspective, even the most highly secured,\neven the most protected documents\n\n274\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.050\nwhen they are printed have to be\nunencrypted in order to be read or\n\n275\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.430\nelse it wouldn't be used.\n\n276\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.580\nAnd so at some point,\nthat data exists in unencrypted format.\n\n277\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.040\nTypically in temp files, swap files,\nmemory cache files as we're sending it to\n\n278\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.110\nthe printer and/or at the device itself\nthat's being queued up to print.\n\n279\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.550\nSo we may, as investigators, be able to\nfind evidence that bad actors know this.\n\n280\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.100\nAnd, they may be looking\nto get into the system and\n\n281\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.750\nsteal that data during transition,\nas it's moving, let's say,\n\n282\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.970\nfrom storage into the print queue and\nit's being transmitted, or\n\n283\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.250\nat the device at point of reception where\nwe are actually processing that data.\n\n284\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.560\nSo, there are things we have to be\naware of as a forensic investigator.\n\n285\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.210\nThese temporary files are worth\na lot of information,\n\n286\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.190\na lot of value to a bad actor.\n\n287\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.130\nThe owner of the document is there.\n\n288\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.580\nThere's metadata associated\nwithin the document itself.\n\n289\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.930\nIt's in raw format, so we may need some\nsort of filter to understand and read it,\n\n290\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.010\nbut we can get it in\nunencrypted form traditionally.\n\n291\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.350\nNumber of copies printed,\nthe print method.\n\n292\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.870\nAll that stuff's associated with the file.\n\n293\n00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.790\nThe metadata, in other words,\nwill tell us all this.\n\n294\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.140\nAnd we're able to go in and get that,\nwhether it's in a raw format or\n\n295\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.050\nsome sort of additional format\ndepending on the application.\n\n296\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.110\nWe should be able to see it and\nour .spl and .shd files for\n\n297\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.820\nour print spool and our printer files\nwill be in this directory in Windows and\n\n298\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.260\nwe have to know that and be aware of that.\n\n299\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.390\nWe would typically use a hex editor\nof some kind to read that data,\n\n300\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.510\nif it's in a raw form or in a .spl file.\n\n301\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.280\nSo pull those .spl files,\nopen up a hex editor.\n\n302\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.600\nAnd we've shown you hex editors in\nour hard drive conversations, right?\n\n303\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.880\nWinHex, HexEdit,\nthere's all sorts of different tools.\n\n304\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.580\nYou dump the file in there and\nthen we can go through and parse the data.\n\n305\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.310\nUCCHECK, another tool that could\nbe used for that if you wanted to.\n\n306\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.880\nWhat about the contents of Clipboard?\n\n307\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.230\nAgain, a memory cache, a space in memory\nyou want to find information from.\n\n308\n00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.190\nWe could go in and\npull that information out.\n\n309\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.770\nWe would be able to go in and find it and\nbring it out if we wanted to.\n\n310\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.490\nAnd when we look at the information, let\nme just bring up the command line here.\n\n311\n00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.790\nJust one second.\n\n312\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.920\nWe could do the following.\n\n313\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.505\nI think I've show you DOS key before.\n\n314\n00:15:15.505 --> 00:15:17.045\nI don't know if I have, but\nI'm pretty sure I have.\n\n315\n00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:20.425\nIf you remember DOS key\nallows us to go in and\n\n316\n00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:25.475\nlook at the historical buffer, the cache\nfor the command shell for the DOS shell,\n\n317\n00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:29.625\nlook at the commands that are there, we\ncan go up and down and find information.\n\n318\n00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.365\nBut look at all the additional\nstuff we have here.\n\n319\n00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:34.795\nWe could specify the list size,\nhow much we retain.\n\n320\n00:15:34.795 --> 00:15:37.693\nWe could look at macros that could be run,\nand\n\n321\n00:15:37.693 --> 00:15:40.350\nif you're aware, in fact we can run\nmacros through the DOS key, right?\n\n322\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.040\nWe could do that.\n\n323\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.190\nOne of the ways we infect systems,\n\n324\n00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.580\nold school old trick to get\nyou to execute malware.\n\n325\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Love the macros, don't they.\n\n326\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Macros are one of the most evil\nthings that we have ever invented.\n\n327\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.395\nNobody thinks about that and\npeople look at them and go macros.\n\n328\n00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:56.193\nThey're so fun, they're lovable.\n\n329\n00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:58.487\nThey are just the most\nevil things in the world.\n\n330\n00:15:58.487 --> 00:15:59.862\nThey're no good.\n&gt;&gt; It's like tribbles.\n\n331\n00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:00.711\n&gt;&gt; Just no good comes of that.\n\n332\n00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.118\n&gt;&gt; They're furry and cute.\n\n333\n00:16:02.118 --> 00:16:03.395\nUntil you can't get rid of them.\n\n334\n00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n335\n00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.795\nUntil you can't get rid of them.\n\n336\n00:16:04.795 --> 00:16:06.333\n&gt;&gt; They're breeding everywhere.\n\n337\n00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:06.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo\n\n338\n00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:11.450\nif you look at DOS key, we want the\nhistory switch here, so we just want H.\n\n339\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.370\nWe can see that we can\nlook at the history.\n\n340\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.570\nIn this case I've got about 12,\n15 commands, whatever it is.\n\n341\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.570\nYou could see the history of\nwhat I've been typing in there.\n\n342\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.584\nWould that be volatile data that would\nbe valuable to a forensic investigator?\n\n343\n00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:24.746\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n344\n00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:28.190\nI mean, we gotta know what's in\nthe DOS Shell or in the whatever the shell\n\n345\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.320\nwould be, if its Bash or Corn or\nwhatever you maybe doing in Linux,\n\n346\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.040\nthe equivalent of this\ncommand exists in every OS.\n\n347\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.990\nIf you have a shell to work with, you\ncould pull the historical reference for\n\n348\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.490\nthat data.\n\n349\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.130\nI'm just gonna move that over so you can\nsee the end of those commands there that\n\n350\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.170\nkind of truncate off to\nthe side of the window.\n\n351\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.700\nWe'd wanna pull those and\nsee what's there.\n\n352\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.660\nCan we then take that information,\nrecord it, validate it, so we know?\n\n353\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:54.810\nIf we see a command line in that\nshell history that executes malware,\n\n354\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.670\nthat executes a Trojan or a logic bomb or\nconnects to a machine or who knows what,\n\n355\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.530\nthat's evidence that we need to be\naware as a forensic investigator.\n\n356\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.770\nSo we've gotta make sure\nwe capture all this.\n\n357\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.790\nWe cannot, can not overlook\nthis kind of volatile data.\n\n358\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.920\nIt's so important.\n\n359\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.810\nDo we get this when we do a full\nforensic capture of the system?\n\n360\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.290\nYeah, if we capture the memory, if we\ncapture all that stuff and have all of it\n\n361\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.220\nwritten out to image files, we would\ncertainly have a record of all this.\n\n362\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.860\nBut if we miss this cuz we're not thinking\nabout it, the minute I reset that system,\n\n363\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.320\nI restart it, turn it off or\nwhatever, this data,\n\n364\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.440\nat least this particular data, is gone.\n\n365\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.040\nIt's just ephemeral, it disappears and\nwe never get it back.\n\n366\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.900\nThere's nothing valuable in my list there.\n\n367\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.710\nAll I'm doing is demoing a bunch of tools\nfor you, but you never know, right?\n\n368\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.160\nI mean, there could be stuff in\nthere that would be very valuable,\n\n369\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.670\nvery important to establish\nauthoritatively one way or\n\n370\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.350\nthe other the progression of events and a\ncertain time associated with those events.\n\n371\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.940\nSo it will be important for us to be\naware of that and to know that, right?\n\n372\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.820\nSo just make sure you're thinking about\nthese kinda things when we talk about\n\n373\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.370\nthe volatile data and the capture of it.\n\n374\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.760\nI showed you the registry key for\nhow to find shares in a Window system.\n\n375\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.998\nIt's right here.\n\n376\n00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:09.740\nI specifically moved the word key off to\nthe side, let me move it a little more so\n\n377\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.480\nyou can see the registry key separate and\nnot think key was part of that.\n\n378\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.086\nBut you can see here at your\nLOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\se-\n\n379\n00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:18.720\nrvices\\lanmanserver\\Shares.\n\n380\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.400\nThis is what was in the registry editor\nwhen I went in to take a look and\n\n381\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.340\nyou could see in the last\nepisode we did this quickly.\n\n382\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.720\nI brought it up and showed it to you.\n\n383\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.480\nNo shares currently there but\n\n384\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.020\nwe could certainly go in, we could\nvalidate whether there are shares.\n\n385\n00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.720\nWe could go to the Windows Explorer,\n\n386\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.935\nwe could use the net\ncommand to look at shares.\n\n387\n00:18:33.935 --> 00:18:37.210\nThere's a lot of different ways to\ndo this but it would be helpful for\n\n388\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.430\nus to authoritatively validate whether\nthere is information there or not.\n\n389\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.200\nUsing nonvolatile information\ncapture methods, there's\n\n390\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.590\na lot of different registry keys here\ndisabling last access update on files.\n\n391\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.957\nThere's some keys here that would\nhelp us to understand whether that's\n\n392\n00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:53.553\nbeen done or not.\n\n393\n00:18:53.553 --> 00:18:57.032\nA lot of times hackers will go in,\nmodify these keys and\n\n394\n00:18:57.032 --> 00:19:02.115\nprevent access information for being\nupdated on files they wanna manipulate.\n\n395\n00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:04.654\nSo they'll hide evidence\nof what they're doing, and\n\n396\n00:19:04.654 --> 00:19:07.586\nmanipulation of these keys would\nbe a point of evidence for us.\n\n397\n00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:10.658\nIf they have been modified and\nthey're not capturing information and\n\n398\n00:19:10.658 --> 00:19:13.366\nthey're not allowing us to\nmanipulate system information,\n\n399\n00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:16.600\nwe may start to scratch our heads and\ngo, well that's unusual.\n\n400\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.055\nWhy is that being done that way?\n\n401\n00:19:18.055 --> 00:19:21.480\nAnd so, knowledge of these keys would be\ngood and you can see them listed here.\n\n402\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.500\nA lot of them are going to be local\nmachine current control set keys,\n\n403\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.310\ncontrol file system in this case.\n\n404\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.710\nDisable last access and\nNTFSDisablelastaccessupdate..\n\n405\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.370\nTwo good keys to take a look at,\nand then examining the file system.\n\n406\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.750\nI like the directory command.\n\n407\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.390\nDirectory/O.\n\n408\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:42.260\nD to list oldest to newest or newest\nto oldest files in terms of just time.\n\n409\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.690\nLet's take a look at this one as well.\n\n410\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.350\nSo another one of those commands\nthat's often overlooked that\n\n411\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.350\npeople just don't think about.\n\n412\n00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.290\nYou know again, they're just not thinking\nabout all the tools that are built into\n\n413\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.750\nWindows and all the command line tools\nthat we may be able to leverage.\n\n414\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.680\nYou know, I talked to a lot of colleagues,\na lot of peers,\n\n415\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.950\na lot of people I work with,\nwork for in our industry.\n\n416\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.470\nI spent a lot of time teaching.\n\n417\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.280\nA lot of time working with customers.\n\n418\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.470\nA lot of time with you, right,\ntalking about these tools, and you know,\n\n419\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.830\nI'm constantly amazed that you all bring\nup a tool and some people are like,\n\n420\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.000\nwell, I never knew that existed.\n\n421\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.260\nAnd I'm not talking about a crazy esoteric\ntool, like you can go out and you gotta\n\n422\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.210\nspend a million dollars for it and only\n5 people on the planet know how to use.\n\n423\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.210\nI'm talking about tools\nthat are just built into\n\n424\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.920\npretty much every version of\noperating system in Windows.\n\n425\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.920\nA tool like dir goes back to the earliest,\nearliest days of Windows, right?\n\n426\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.090\nI mean, the DOS key that we just showed\nyou, the earliest versions of Windows.\n\n427\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.240\nIf you go back to NT35351,\nthese tools have been in the OS for 12,\n\n428\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.220\n15 generations at this point.\n\n429\n00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.150\n20, 30 years in some cases, right?\n\n430\n00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.630\nI mean, these are not new tools.\n\n431\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.070\nAnd I'm not suggesting that that means if\nyou do or don't know them, that you are or\n\n432\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.150\nare not good at what you do.\n\n433\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.770\nI'm just pointing out that a lot of\ntimes we just don't take the time\n\n434\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.320\nto really think about the basics.\n\n435\n00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.510\nWe're so focused on what's that app?\n\n436\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.475\nI hear that all the time,\nit drives me nuts.\n\n437\n00:20:57.475 --> 00:20:59.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do you have an app for that?\n\n438\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.950\nWhat's that new tool that I can go out and\nuse?\n\n439\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.940\nWell all those things are good,\ndon't get me wrong, but\n\n440\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.130\nyou know sometimes the basics are gonna\nget the job done just as well.\n\n441\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.206\nAnd when I show up, and\nI have my quote unquote toolkit,\n\n442\n00:21:11.206 --> 00:21:15.310\nwe'll keep talking about building the\nforensics examiner's toolkit with tools\n\n443\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.600\nyou're gonna use, I firmly believe\nyou're gotta have the expensive tools.\n\n444\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.860\nYou gotta have a lot of the free tools.\n\n445\n00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.890\nYou'll often hear me say that, and\nyou got to know the built-in tools, right?\n\n446\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.880\nIf you know your way around an OS, and\n\n447\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.950\nyou can leverage those tools\nto get information you want,\n\n448\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.210\nwhat a powerful piece of knowledge or\nknowledge items you possess.\n\n449\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.650\nAs an investigator, as an administrator,\nas an IT professional,\n\n450\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.310\nyou have access to knowledge that\nmost people just are not aware of,\n\n451\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.940\neven though it's sitting right\nthere in front them, right?\n\n452\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.160\nJust staring them in the face, right?\n\n453\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.592\n&gt;&gt; Is that because people are really\nheavily reliant upon third party\n\n454\n00:21:47.592 --> 00:21:50.680\npay-for tools or even non pay-for tools?\n\n455\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.540\n&gt;&gt; You know, honestly I think\nit's not even so much that.\n\n456\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.000\nYou know, a lot of times we'll talk about\nthat and I used to think it was that, but\n\n457\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.380\nthen I would ask people why do you\nhave a preference for this or this?\n\n458\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.390\nWell so and so\ntold me this was a good tool,\n\n459\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.150\nor I found that this was\na tool that worked in the GUI.\n\n460\n00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.640\nAnd as I started to peel\nback those discussions,\n\n461\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.420\nwhat I actually found was\nfear of the command line.\n\n462\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; And we often talk\n\n463\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.620\nabout that with PowerShell for\ninstance, or just in general you and\n\n464\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.670\nI talk a lot about scripting and\ndifferent things.\n\n465\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.450\nAnd your preference for Linux and\n\n466\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.090\nobviously your use in that environment of\na shell and a command editor to do stuff.\n\n467\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.420\nYou know, the amount of work I do in\nPowerShell and all that kind of stuff.\n\n468\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.809\nWe talk a lot about that and\nyou've heard us talk about that but\n\n469\n00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:34.240\nthe reality is these are tools from\nthe earliest, in many cases, the earliest,\n\n470\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.827\nearliest, earliest days of what we would\nthink of as modern day GUI-based OS's.\n\n471\n00:22:38.827 --> 00:22:41.860\nBut, they've been in\nthe command shell from day one.\n\n472\n00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.780\n&gt;&gt; Inception.\n\n473\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.520\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately most Windows\nadministrators have just not\n\n474\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.390\nreally had a reason, compelling reason, to\nspend a lot of time in the command shell.\n\n475\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.620\nYour early on, DOS, if you think\nabout DOS as an operating system,\n\n476\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.460\nand it was and it still is.\n\n477\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.310\nVery important OS in the history,\nthe arc of development, but\n\n478\n00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.250\none that was not used for\nall that long, when you think about it.\n\n479\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.980\nAnd most of the people that would\nhave operated in those environments\n\n480\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.840\nare probably at the end or\nnear the end of their careers today.\n\n481\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.340\nThere are still certainly many people that\nknow about them and would've used them but\n\n482\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.430\nthey may not be actively\ndoing this kind of work.\n\n483\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.220\nAnd really the more modern administrators,\nthe IT admins today that\n\n484\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.430\nare Windows-centric,\nprobably grew up on a GUI environment.\n\n485\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.620\nAnd it may have been second,\nthird, fourth generation, but\n\n486\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.540\nthey were starting to use tools,\nas opposed to the command line.\n\n487\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.160\nWe didn't really have a good narrative,\na good story for\n\n488\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.360\nthis in Windows until\nPowerShell comes a long.\n\n489\n00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.980\nThat's a 5, 6 7-year-old tool at this\npoint but it's a very modern tool.\n\n490\n00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.832\nIt's only really caught on in the last\ncouple of years, in the sense that you\n\n491\n00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:46.250\nknow, with the modern advent of,\nlet's say Server 16, Windows 10.\n\n492\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.316\nThe really, really most recent\nversions that we start to see that.\n\n493\n00:23:50.316 --> 00:23:54.457\nAnd as a result, you know, it's a lot of\nthe old school tools and that knowledge,\n\n494\n00:23:54.457 --> 00:23:58.617\nit may not be as prevalent because a lot\nof the people that Understood those tools.\n\n495\n00:23:58.617 --> 00:24:01.678\nWhile they still may be working and\nstill may be doing this,\n\n496\n00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:04.630\nmay not necessarily be sharing\nthat knowledge, right.\n\n497\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.590\nOr, they may not be dealing with these\nnewer people that are coming on to do this\n\n498\n00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.440\nand I think it's just a matter\nof generational drift.\n\n499\n00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.730\nI just think those tools kinda, we lose\nfocus on them, we don't think about them.\n\n500\n00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I do see Microsoft kinda\nmaking a push toward, like you say,\n\n501\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.120\nthe PowerShell becoming something\nthat they want their system\n\n502\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.210\nadministrators to be very\ncomfortable in working with.\n\n503\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:22.840\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n504\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.940\n&gt;&gt; So, I think that's a good thing.\n\n505\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.390\nI always felt like working in\na command line environment\n\n506\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.700\nkind of gave me more of a personal,\n\n507\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.960\nlike I felt like I was using my computer\nin a more in-depth way, I think.\n\n508\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust if you can get a lot out of it.\n\n509\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.020\nYou know, as an investigator,\nas a security.\n\n510\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.670\nI'm putting on my security hat,\nnot my IT forensics hat.\n\n511\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.070\nI do a lot of different things, but\n\n512\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.650\nI find that knowledge of those tools\npollinates across all those roles.\n\n513\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.080\nIf I'm the system admin, if I'm the\nvirtualization guy, if I'm the security\n\n514\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.620\nguy, if I'm the auditor, if I can go\nin quickly and look at a timestamp, or\n\n515\n00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:02.870\na list in order of date based\naccess on a file or on a set\n\n516\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.190\nof files in a directory quickly, I don't\nneed to get somebody to do it for me.\n\n517\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.440\nI can just look at it.\n\n518\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.350\nI can tell so much about a system and\n\n519\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.550\nI can be a lot more effective as\nan administrator doing my job.\n\n520\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.940\nSo to that end if we wanna go back here,\n\n521\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.240\nwhat I was suggesting was\nthe Directory Command.\n\n522\n00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.550\nYour directory space\nyou can see /O gives me\n\n523\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:25.370\na listing of the directory information and\nyou'll see here it goes,\n\n524\n00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.260\nin this case, it's ordered or\nrather just kind of mixed up but\n\n525\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.930\nI can do it if I use some additional\nswitches with sort order.\n\n526\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.310\nI can do it oldest to newest,\n\n527\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.800\nI can do it alphabetical,\nthere's a bunch of options here.\n\n528\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.720\nIn the command line sort order by name,\nby extension, group directories by size,\n\n529\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.840\nsmallest first, by date time so\nthey use D and O.\n\n530\n00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.110\nPrefix to reverse order.\n\n531\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.740\nI can do all sorts of stuff here.\n\n532\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.306\nAnd so, if I go in and I use that switch\nthe right way I'll actually be able to\n\n533\n00:25:54.306 --> 00:25:56.930\nsort them, or see the information.\n\n534\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.885\nIt presents a lot of value to me so\ninstead of just directory/O, if I do\n\n535\n00:26:01.885 --> 00:26:07.645\ndirectory/O like this, I'm then able to\nget them to sort out oldest to newest,\n\n536\n00:26:07.645 --> 00:26:11.530\nor newest to oldest or whatever I want,\njust based on sort order as you can see.\n\n537\n00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.020\nI'm just doing the users'\nhost directory where I am.\n\n538\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.070\nYou can change directory and\n\n539\n00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.660\ndo this in the root and\nthen sort it out that to a file.\n\n540\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.400\nAnd you have an authoritative list of\naccess times or at least creation times,\n\n541\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.860\nlast time that file was touched.\n\n542\n00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.900\nYou can begin to zero in on what\nthe priority order for usage was, and\n\n543\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.390\nas a result, what files and\n\n544\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.858\ndirectories may be of value within\nthe timeframe of the incident.\n\n545\n00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:36.080\nCuz you knowm if you have files\nthat are five years old and\n\n546\n00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.780\nthen files that were\ncreated two weeks ago,\n\n547\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.620\nand the incident happened two weeks ago,\nyou're not gonna waste your time looking\n\n548\n00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.080\nat a bunch of stuff that hasn't\nbeen touched in five years.\n\n549\n00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.120\nSo we gotta start vetting this information\nto figure out when it was accessed.\n\n550\n00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.330\nAnd a simple command, you know, just using\na simple switch with the directory command\n\n551\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.300\ngives us so much additional power\nto be able to understand this.\n\n552\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.850\nWe can look at tools like FSutil\nlike I mentioned in my notes,\n\n553\n00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.780\nanother tool you can download, autorun.\n\n554\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.440\nLooks at what's running, I've mentioned\nthis tool before, we've talked about this.\n\n555\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.416\nMicrosoft security IDs for the user,\nwhat are the security IDs?\n\n556\n00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:11.410\nWe often talk about the SIDs and the GUIDs\nand how to find them and what they are.\n\n557\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.253\nGo in and look at the profile list and\ngive you the command or\n\n558\n00:27:15.253 --> 00:27:18.161\nrather the registry key here, one second.\n\n559\n00:27:18.161 --> 00:27:23.268\nTo go in right here, look at this registry\nkey and you'll find the information for\n\n560\n00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:26.386\nall the users that have active accounts,\nright?\n\n561\n00:27:26.386 --> 00:27:29.823\nSo, instead of local machine current\ncontrol server, we're going to server,\n\n562\n00:27:29.823 --> 00:27:32.492\nMicrosoft Windows NT current\nversion profile list.\n\n563\n00:27:32.492 --> 00:27:35.680\nKnowledge of the Windows registry, and\nthere's probably about 30 different\n\n564\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.190\nregistry keys that I've put into\nthe notes that we're gonna talk about or\n\n565\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.430\nat least point out to you and\nyou have access to.\n\n566\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.778\nBut take them, go to any of your Windows\nmachines, you're looking at us now,\n\n567\n00:27:43.778 --> 00:27:46.250\nyou probably have access\nto a Windows machine.\n\n568\n00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.600\nGo find one, start pulling those keys up.\n\n569\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.450\nThe best way for\nyou to figure this stuff out is to sit\n\n570\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.681\ndown there at the keyboard and\nsay okay, what does that key do?\n\n571\n00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:56.070\nLet me go in and\ntake a look, what do I find?\n\n572\n00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.560\nIs it different by version?\n\n573\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.640\nTry it on a Windows 7 machine.\n\n574\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.176\nTry it on a Windows 10 machine,\nor on a Server 12 machine,\n\n575\n00:28:02.176 --> 00:28:05.100\nlike the demo environments we have there,\nright?\n\n576\n00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.138\nServer 16.\n\n577\n00:28:06.138 --> 00:28:09.070\nLot of these keys essentially\nstay the same version to version.\n\n578\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.650\nSome of them,\nthere's some minute differences.\n\n579\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.990\nYou'll see me note some of them in some\nof the notes a little bit further down,\n\n580\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.770\ndepending on the version\nof what we're doing.\n\n581\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.170\nThings like IE, for instance, does vary.\n\n582\n00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.600\nA lot of the paths vary.\n\n583\n00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.070\nWhere we store the cache data,\nthings like that may vary by version.\n\n584\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.030\nBut in general,\nknowledge of these registry keys.\n\n585\n00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.850\nThere's about 20 or 30 different keys that\nI check every time I investigate a Windows\n\n586\n00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.760\nmachine right off the bat,\nthat I'm just going to go through.\n\n587\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.992\nI'm gonna wanna to find the data for.\n\n588\n00:28:33.992 --> 00:28:35.640\nYou could write a PowerShell\nscript that goes in and\n\n589\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.050\ndumps the contents of those keys and\ntells you what they are, right?\n\n590\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.040\nIt wouldn't be hard to do but these\nare the keys that as an investigator,\n\n591\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.460\nI need to be aware of,\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n592\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.690\nNumber one, to do your job and\n\n593\n00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.390\ncertainly in the real world be\nable to look at these machines.\n\n594\n00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.030\nBut also, from an exam perspective,\nmay be valuable to know hey,\n\n595\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.500\nwhere do I got to find the user\ninformation, the profile list,\n\n596\n00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.480\nthe user's security IDs, so\nwhere can I find that in Windows?\n\n597\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.960\nWell, that's the key right there.\n\n598\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.470\nI'm not suggesting you're gonna have\nto spout registry keys in the exam, but\n\n599\n00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.640\nI am suggesting you may see one or\nmore of them in a question,\n\n600\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.480\nhave to know what they represent,\nor choose them as the right option.\n\n601\n00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.800\nSo the ones that we put into the notes may\nbe good for you to pay attention to or\n\n602\n00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.360\nthey may not.\n\n603\n00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.020\nIt's hard to say.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n604\n00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.700\n&gt;&gt; You never know.\n\n605\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.560\n&gt;&gt; You never know,\nit's a box of chocolates.\n\n606\n00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.380\n&gt;&gt; It's like the DOS key.\n\n607\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.180\nSometimes you use it, sometimes you don't.\n\n608\n00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.215\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell Adam, I'm looking at a clock.\n\n609\n00:29:23.215 --> 00:29:25.985\nI do see that we are a bit out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n610\n00:29:25.985 --> 00:29:29.395\nBut as we can see from your notes on the\nscreen, we definitely have more to cover.\n\n611\n00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.425\nSo join us back for the part

00:00:11.933\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.844\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:17.010\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.166\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:22.320\nIn today's episode,\nit is more in our CHFI Version 9 series,\n\n8\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.300\ncontinuing in our conversation\non operating system forensics.\n\n9\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300\nAnd joining us in that conversation,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.960\nAdam, good to have you again man.\n\n11\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.500\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Thank you sir, always glad to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.060\nGoing well, hopefully going well for all\nof your out there, wherever you may be.\n\n13\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.990\nThere, there, there, and everywhere.\n\n14\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.250\nWe are gonna continue talking.\n\n15\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.990\nWe are in part three,\nthe reason we're in part three is because,\n\n16\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.890\nwell we ran out of room in part two and\nwe still had more stuff to talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.850\nSo we're gonna continue talking\nabout operating system forensics.\n\n18\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.910\nWe left off talking about different ways\nwe could manipulate some of the volatile\n\n19\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.250\ndata and non volatile data on the systems.\n\n20\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.041\nLooking at the command line a bit deeper,\n\n21\n00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.316\nlooking at some of the hidden treasures\nand commands that are buried there,\n\n22\n00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.149\nthe DOS key command,\nthe directory command, things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.533\nI thought we'd take a look at event\nlogs and index.dat files for IE.\n\n24\n00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:12.087\nI mentioned the fact that in Windows 10 in\nthe first episode that the Edge browser\n\n25\n00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:17.815\nuses the ESE data formula instead of the\nmore traditional .dat files to store data.\n\n26\n00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:19.493\nSo there's a lot of stuff to know about.\n\n27\n00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:23.270\nIf you take a look on my notes here and\nwe'll go into the browser here\n\n28\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.110\nspecifically just to pull\nup the URLs I had there.\n\n29\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.294\nIf you wanna look for IE history file\nformat, all the way up through as you\n\n30\n00:01:30.294 --> 00:01:34.008\ncould see there from version four\nback up through version nine.\n\n31\n00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:39.002\nSo all the way up through Vista, you would\nsee all the different information here,\n\n32\n00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.426\nnice little website tells you\nwhere to find everything,\n\n33\n00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:45.874\nwhat the file locations will be,\nthe temp caches, etc.\n\n34\n00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:51.111\n2000 through XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,\nsome useful information, talks about\n\n35\n00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:55.885\nthe file header a little bit, and how to\nread that, good, valuable information.\n\n36\n00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:59.440\nRemember a lot of times, we're not\njust working on the most recent OS.\n\n37\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.640\nThere's a lot of older OS's out there.\n\n38\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.270\nA lot of times, people that are up to no\ngood will purposefully use older OS's\n\n39\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.240\nin order to make it harder for\nus to find data because\n\n40\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.220\na more modern investigator may not have\nexperience with some of those older OS's.\n\n41\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.880\nThose older OS's may be good for covering\ntracks and getting the job done for\n\n42\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.550\ncertain things because they may\nhave certain vulnerabilities, but\n\n43\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.470\nthey may also have older tools that\nwe may not have seen or be aware of.\n\n44\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.720\nYou gotta think about\nthat a lot of the times.\n\n45\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.080\nToday with virtualization and with the\nadvent of the ability to host almost any\n\n46\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.840\nOS in the cloud,\ngoing back to some of the earliest OS's,\n\n47\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.180\nit's not unheard of that we find that\nthese are used as the launching pad or\n\n48\n00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.670\nthe attack platform for these attacks.\n\n49\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.310\nAnd so we gotta be thinking about that.\n\n50\n00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.470\nWe have to be multi-generational\nif you wanna think about that and\n\n51\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.670\njust think about the logic of that.\n\n52\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.320\nSo we have that.\n\n53\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.340\nWhere is and\nwhat is the index.dat file in Windows 7?\n\n54\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.320\nWhere to go in Windows 8, Windows 10?\n\n55\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.840\nAnother good website that'll\nhelp you to take a look at that.\n\n56\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.810\nI'm gonna show you where to find stuff\nin Windows 10 using the Edge browser,\n\n57\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.490\nI'm just going to delve through all that.\n\n58\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.540\nFile path, looking for\n\n59\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.500\nthose hidden directories that you\nhave gotta be aware of, where the ESC\n\n60\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.220\ndatabase files are, we're gonna take\na look at that in just a minute.\n\n61\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.150\nBut knowing where these things are,\nreading up on them a little bit,\n\n62\n00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.380\nagain just trying to give you some URLs\nthat are in the show notes about where you\n\n63\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.660\nwould find stuff, hopefully,\nwill be helpful and valuable for you.\n\n64\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.210\nWhen we take a look, just go in here,\nthe path is a long one.\n\n65\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.290\nYou can kinda see that it\nis a little bit convoluted.\n\n66\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.230\nI have the path statements in my notes.\n\n67\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.520\nWe'll show them to you in a minute.\n\n68\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.400\nBut you go find in the users directory,\nthe user you're currently logged in as, or\n\n69\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.830\nthe user you wanna find information for,\nand the user's directory on this machine.\n\n70\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.574\nI've got the nate profile,\nthe host profile, the all user's profile,\n\n71\n00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:46.325\nI'm logged in under host, so\nI'm looking at my profile right now.\n\n72\n00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:52.300\nApp data, local packages,\nMicrosoft.MicrosoftEdge, underscore and\n\n73\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.250\nthen a seemingly random alpha numeric\nstring identifying the browser instance.\n\n74\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.070\nAnd then AC and then there is a bunch\nof sub directories if we go up.\n\n75\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.700\nOne you'll see here in this case,\nnumber #001, 002, 003, etc, 5,\n\n76\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.220\nInetCache, InetCookies, InetHistory,\nTemp, MicrosoftEdge, Microsoft.\n\n77\n00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.070\nThere's a bunch of file folders in here.\n\n78\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.710\nThere's a lot of stuff\nhidden in these directories.\n\n79\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.960\nSo when I go into one of\nthe numbered hashtag directories and\n\n80\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.410\nI start looking and I go into INetCache,\nyou'll see there's nothing there.\n\n81\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.480\nCookies, nothing there and\nthe hidden files, history, nothing there.\n\n82\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.890\nBut do not despair, fear not.\n\n83\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.440\nGo into local state, nothing there,\nbut you keep looking and\n\n84\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.550\nyou go into Microsoft and\nyou begin to find some things.\n\n85\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.380\nWe could see in F12, if we've used\nthe system debugger, the debug window,\n\n86\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.980\nthe program window for looking at code\nin IE, we could see evidence of that.\n\n87\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.300\nI've shown you that in\nsome prior episodes.\n\n88\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.430\nWe'll show you that again,\n\n89\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.180\nthe upcoming conversations about how to do\nweb-related stuff or hacking web stuff.\n\n90\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.009\nThe URL cache in here, so there's a bunch\nof different of system files in here\n\n91\n00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.890\nthat give us information about\nURLs that we may have visited.\n\n92\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.540\nSo there's some stuff here that would\nbe valuable, there's meta data for\n\n93\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.325\nthose system files that can\nbe examined with hex editors.\n\n94\n00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:19.430\nThere is a list of system certificates,\nand\n\n95\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.130\nthere are certificate\nrevocation list folders and\n\n96\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.520\ncertificate directories that may or\nmay not bear fruit.\n\n97\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.450\nYou could see there's none in this right\nnow because I haven't downloaded or\n\n98\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.320\ninstalled any certificates\nunder my profile.\n\n99\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.180\nBut if somebody has done that, while\nwe could see them from the certificate\n\n100\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.730\ncache using another Microsoft\nmanagement console even a web browser,\n\n101\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.500\nas we've shown you in other episodes.\n\n102\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.350\nI would actually see evidence of\nthose certificates referenced here.\n\n103\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.970\nSo I could get copies of them,\ngood to know.\n\n104\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.470\nIn Windows, I have a PRI file that\nwould be valuable that may give me\n\n105\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.760\nsome information about what's going on,\nand certain information about how\n\n106\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.840\nthe browser's being used referenced to\nthis profile, referenced to this session.\n\n107\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.580\nSo that may be valuable.\n\n108\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.600\nI can go into the Edge folder,\nMicrosoft Edge.\n\n109\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.550\nAnd there I start to see in my\ncache directory as I drill down,\n\n110\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.890\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n111\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.958\nThat's all the files, all the videos,\nthe jpgs, everything I would've looked at,\n\n112\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.700\nall that stuff, all that's there.\n\n113\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Treasure trove.\n\n114\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Treasure trove.\n\n115\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.960\nAll my JavaScript files,\nmy gif files, everything is there so\n\n116\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.600\nI have no idea what this is but\nthere's a JPEG file right here.\n\n117\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.290\nSo I may be able to go in, maybe able to\ntake a look at that and preview that,\n\n118\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.380\ngrab that download that, right?\n\n119\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.220\nSo not knowing what it is you could\nopen it up, there's a JPEG file.\n\n120\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.930\nI have no idea who it is,\nno idea where it came from but\n\n121\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.990\nobviously if that picture was important,\nif that person doing a selfie or\n\n122\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.360\nwhatever they're doing is something\nthat I would have to know about,\n\n123\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.570\nthen maybe now that's an important\npiece of information, who knows, right?\n\n124\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.350\nSo being able to go in and\nfind all these photos and\n\n125\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.590\nlook at them, probably important to know\nthat, and know what they are, right?\n\n126\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.010\nSo, again, I can start to catalog\nall this information, grab all this,\n\n127\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.180\njust by knowing where it is.\n\n128\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.850\nI'm not using a tool by the way,\nI mean I am, right?\n\n129\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.280\nI'm using the Windows File Explorer, but\n\n130\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.090\nmy point is I'm not using\na separate third party fancy tool.\n\n131\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.620\nI'm using just the built in\ntools on the operating system\n\n132\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.590\njust by knowing the path to go\nto to find this information, and\n\n133\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.930\nto be able to extract it out of the file\nsystem and start to look for it.\n\n134\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.830\nAnd so\nwe can find all of this information, and\n\n135\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.710\nwe can see the different\nstore tables that are listed.\n\n136\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.850\nI've shown you a couple of them.\n\n137\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.270\nAnd we could see the different paths.\n\n138\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.330\nI have the database path,\nthe cache file location.\n\n139\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.320\nWe were just looking at that right now.\n\n140\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.080\nLast active data session, the history,\n\n141\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.340\nthe cookies, the HTTP posts,\nI just showed you some of that.\n\n142\n00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.078\nIf the last browsing session\nwas opened up in private mode,\n\n143\n00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:44.105\nthen the browser would store those\nrecords in a different place.\n\n144\n00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:47.087\nAll these strings in the nodes by the way,\nare one long continuous pathway\n\n145\n00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:50.261\nif they truncate them obviously because\nof the space real estate if we made them\n\n146\n00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.098\nsmaller enough to make them one line,\nthey'd be about four points and\n\n147\n00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.585\nyou wouldn't be able to see\nanything without a microscope.\n\n148\n00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.105\nBut you could reproduce them just by\nstitching them back together again from\n\n149\n00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.120\nthe show notes.\n\n150\n00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.284\nYou'll find them all there.\n\n151\n00:08:01.284 --> 00:08:05.263\nBut you'll see user, user name,\napp data, local packages Microsoft on\n\n152\n00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:08.666\nMicrosoft Edge,\nwhatever that numerical sequence would be,\n\n153\n00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:12.258\nAC Microsoft Edge, as I told you,\nuser, and then the recovery for\n\n154\n00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:16.490\nthe active browser session ID, and\nthe DAT file if you do it in private.\n\n155\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.550\nThat in private tab stealths\nthe browsing session, but\n\n156\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.860\nthat doesn't mean there's\nnot a record of it.\n\n157\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.320\nIt just means you have to look a little\nbit further to find the DAT files.\n\n158\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.630\nBut we could then recover that\ninformation and you could see that there.\n\n159\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.200\nSo there's a lot to know and\na lot to be aware of with regards to, for\n\n160\n00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.360\ninstance, looking at the web browser and\nthe web information.\n\n161\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.580\nCould you do the same thing with Chrome,\nsame thing with Firefox, with Safari, etc.\n\n162\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.000\nYes, all of them store these files.\n\n163\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.930\nIt's just a matter of knowing the pass,\nknowing where to go,\n\n164\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.550\nknowing how to forensically examine that\ndata on the appropriate system by version.\n\n165\n00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.130\nAnd if you don't know, you do what\neverybody else does, you go out and\n\n166\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.850\ngoogle and find it, you look it up because\nthat's what I do when I don't know,\n\n167\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.100\nthat's what you should do.\n\n168\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.650\nIt's good advice if everybody tells you\ndifferently, they're lying to you, right.\n\n169\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.020\nI mean you should be able to go out and\nlook that stuff up.\n\n170\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.200\nBut the reality is, most of us,\n\n171\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.520\nunless we work with that browser every\nday, wouldn't begin to know where to look.\n\n172\n00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.720\nAnd even if we did,\nhow would you know where to go,\n\n173\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.515\nunless you spend time poking around\nthe operating system trying to figure it.\n\n174\n00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:17.395\nThat's out there somewhere,\nit is documented.\n\n175\n00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:18.875\nYou just got to look\nit up from the vendor,\n\n176\n00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:21.875\nthe vendor eventually puts all\nthat stuff in their documentation,\n\n177\n00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.695\nyou just gotta be patient enough to\nread through it and find it, all right.\n\n178\n00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:28.455\nSo device information,\nwhere can we find things like slack space,\n\n179\n00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:32.515\nhow do I scan virtual memory,\nhow do I find device information,\n\n180\n00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:36.830\ngot some URLs that will be valuable here\nfor you, just walk them through my list.\n\n181\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.380\nSo the windows, the Devcon tool,\n\n182\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.150\nis a command line tool that displays\ndetailed information about your computer.\n\n183\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.500\nOne of those buried little gems\nthat we may not be aware of.\n\n184\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.470\nBut Devon is a great little tool,\nthat comes to us from the WSDK or\n\n185\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:57.010\nthe WDK, the driver kit and\nthe development kits.\n\n186\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.540\nThat you've got the path there for Devcon,\ndepending how it's installed, the commands\n\n187\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.100\nfor Devcon, and the examples are listed\nhere, in terms of how you can use it.\n\n188\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.350\nWhat Devcon does is it's a cross between\ncomputer management console, so it gives\n\n189\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.560\nyou information on things like the\nhardware, the drivers, things like that.\n\n190\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.980\nAs you can see, we can enable and\ndisable devices, we can update drivers,\n\n191\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.110\ninstall a device, remove it.\n\n192\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.820\nForce rescan on plug and play.\n\n193\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.430\nIt's like right-clicking,\ngoing to Computer and Manage, and\n\n194\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.590\nlooking at Management Console,\nwhere the drive manager is and\n\n195\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.890\nthe hardware is, and all that.\n\n196\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.680\nIt's the same idea, it's just another\ntool that may be valuable for you.\n\n197\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.060\nThat way you have it, you can interact\nwith it sometimes and work with it.\n\n198\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.420\nA lot of times I find\nthat when I go in and\n\n199\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.080\nI look at Windows machines if they've been\nmodified because of malware especially\n\n200\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.170\nroot kits that some of the traditional\ntools that are built in that we think of\n\n201\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.350\nin the control panel may not\nbe working the right way.\n\n202\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.740\nNot because they're not available but\nthey're executable path.\n\n203\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.290\nThey're an environment of variables.\n\n204\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.860\nTheir environmental variables\nhave been reprogrammed.\n\n205\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.180\nSo they go off into space essentially and\ndon't fire the right way.\n\n206\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.630\nNow you could go in and edit those but\nyou're obviously modifying system data.\n\n207\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.420\nNot recommended for\n\n208\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.730\nyou to fight that fight with\nthe malware in real time on the image.\n\n209\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.820\nBut if you know that those tools are not\nworking you have a third external tool,\n\n210\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.180\nyou can bring to the party that\nwill fire and work the right way so\n\n211\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.740\nit's not been modified.\n\n212\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.360\nThen having that capability\nis usually a good thing.\n\n213\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.050\nSo a tool like Dev Con would actually\nbe a really good tool for you to have.\n\n214\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.690\nSo gave you the URL to figure out\nwhere to get that from the MSDN site.\n\n215\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.330\nAlways good to download the tool\nfrom a vendor that makes it, right?\n\n216\n00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.580\nAnother tool, the Drive Spy tool here from\nDigital Intelligence allows us to go in\n\n217\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.180\nand it's a forensics DOS shell.\n\n218\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.230\nIt may be a little bit hard to see.\n\n219\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.620\nIt talks about it right here.\n\n220\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.700\nBut lets you emulate and extend and\n\n221\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.710\nuse DOS against the system\nforensically in a sound way.\n\n222\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.200\nLet's you connect to the machine,\nexamine the machine.\n\n223\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.310\nUsing Right Block technology, without\nthe capability to be able to modify data.\n\n224\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.230\nSo it's a very valuable additional tool.\n\n225\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.640\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n226\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.770\nIt does tell you,\n\n227\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.794\nprogram that it's a DOS application\nthat does not function in Windows.\n\n228\n00:11:56.794 --> 00:12:00.230\nYou're using a shell right so\njust be aware of that.\n\n229\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.770\nBut it is a good tool and\none that you should look at and again\n\n230\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.340\nif you have to think about the fact that\nit loads with one of those, if you don't\n\n231\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.930\nknow what that is by the way this school\nis not for you lets keep it simple right.\n\n232\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.570\nIf you can't identify the picture,\n\n233\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.720\nyou probably shouldn't be\nthinking about using the tool.\n\n234\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.000\nThat's a floppy disk\nincase you don't know.\n\n235\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.880\nThe interesting about this, you actually\ncan use this and mount it as a virtual\n\n236\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.260\nfloppy and can actually use it in\nvirtual machines, which is kinda cool.\n\n237\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is.\n&gt;&gt; Found that out a couple of months\n\n238\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.490\nback I had to actually get that\nworking and I was able to mount it.\n\n239\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.370\n&gt;&gt; Where there´s a will, right?\n\n240\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah just you never know, right?\n\n241\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.204\nYou never know.\nSo a tool like that would be good.\n\n242\n00:12:32.204 --> 00:12:37.440\nX-Ways, forensics, this is computer\nforensics software that let's you go in\n\n243\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.760\nand again, be able to run under the most\nmodern version of Windows let's you go in\n\n244\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.080\nand take a look at discloning and imaging,\nyou can partition as you see here.\n\n245\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.570\nYou can look at all sorts\nof kinds of information.\n\n246\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.190\nIt's a great way to\ncapture forensic images.\n\n247\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.260\nLet's do the hashing on the images,\nlet's do all sorts of great stuff,\n\n248\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.900\nvery valuable tool, one that I like a lot,\none that I use from time to time.\n\n249\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.510\nIt does read most modern RAID based\nsystems, so it can understand hardware and\n\n250\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.160\nsoftware based RAID,\ngot a lot of capabilities, just yet\n\n251\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.140\nanother tool that may be valuable for\nyou to think about.\n\n252\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.670\nPotentially to use to try to show you\nbunch of different stuff that may prove to\n\n253\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.380\nbe valuable for you.\n\n254\n00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.750\nVirtual memory can be scanned using\nthat tool as well which is why\n\n255\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.870\nI put it up there.\n\n256\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.560\nSo lots of different ways for\nus to grab information.\n\n257\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.270\nLots of different ways for\nus to be able to interact.\n\n258\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.930\nBe able to get access to\ndata that may be valuable or\n\n259\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.700\nthat we may need to know about,\nas I trip over my tongue.\n\n260\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.990\nWhat about a Windows system that\ngoes into hibernation mode.\n\n261\n00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.560\nI have a hibernate files right\ndown there at the bottom.\n\n262\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.520\nWhen you think about hibernate mode and\n\n263\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.330\nagain most modern\noperating systems do this.\n\n264\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.680\nIt’s not just a Windows thing,\n\n265\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.520\nthe MacOS does this right\nclose the lid on the machine.\n\n266\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.680\nThe machine is there but it’s just kind\nof sleeping it’s in a low power mode and.\n\n267\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.730\nYou'll wake it up by bringing it back\nup and system loads back up again.\n\n268\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.840\nGood for a lot of reasons.\n\n269\n00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.790\nGood for us as investigators cause we\nessentially take that live data that's\n\n270\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.090\nrunning in volatile memory.\n\n271\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.800\nWe cache it to a file, and that way that\nallows us to put the system to sleep and\n\n272\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.610\nrestore the system from\nthat file if need be.\n\n273\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.780\nWe can bring that up from the hybrid\nfill .sys file in Windows.\n\n274\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.310\nAnd we can then bring that file out if we\ngrab an image of that drive using DD or\n\n275\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.150\nanother imaging tool,\naccess FDK or whatever.\n\n276\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.010\nWe can read that file, that's the current\nstate of the system with all the live\n\n277\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.130\ndynamic data running in it in real time.\n\n278\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.420\nSo if we grab that file\nas an investigator.\n\n279\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.410\nWe actually can download\nthe equivalent file on whatever OS.\n\n280\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.560\nYou're looking at, we can actually then go\nahead and we can read that information.\n\n281\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.740\nAll the programs, learning the process\nIDs, the dynamic hashes, all those\n\n282\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.640\nstuff will be in that hyberfill\ndocsis file stored on the hard drive.\n\n283\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.210\nCenter's big cache file\nif we think about it.\n\n284\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.450\nSo, it's all there.\n\n285\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.870\nIf hibernation is enabled in the OS,\nat least in Windows anyway.\n\n286\n00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.070\nThere's a registry key\nthat lets us find that.\n\n287\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.270\nYou can see it right here,\nCurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power.\n\n288\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.150\nRight, so you would go in,\ntake a look at that and\n\n289\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.270\ndepending on the settings you find there\nhibernation may or may not be enabled.\n\n290\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.780\nIf it's enabled, maybe be worth looking\nto see if there's a hiberfil file.\n\n291\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.290\nYou could see the name of\nit up there as I suggested.\n\n292\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.490\nAnd that file would be worth going after.\n\n293\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.370\nNow we may just obviously do a full\ndisk copy, get that file anyway.\n\n294\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.790\nBut the point is if you know you want to\ntarget that search for that in the image.\n\n295\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.000\nYou find one of those you'll\nget the memory state and\n\n296\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.160\nall of the dynamic data of the system\nwhenever it went to sleep.\n\n297\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.030\nAd that's important because\nthat's the file that we go after.\n\n298\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.230\nPage file again very important.\n\n299\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.620\nSource of data the page file.sys.\n\n300\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.120\nFile is gonna be a file\nthat we want to go after.\n\n301\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.640\nThe path forward here,\nmachine system current control set.\n\n302\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.150\nControl session manager memory\nmanagement think I spelt that, yeah,\n\n303\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.480\nspelt that correctly.\n\n304\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.723\nSo I want to go in, take a look for\nthat, because that's gonna tell us again\n\n305\n00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:48.824\na lot of information dynamically\nabout what's going on in the system.\n\n306\n00:15:48.824 --> 00:15:52.779\nRemember, the page file is where we're\nswapping memory back and forth and\n\n307\n00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:57.364\nwriting dynamic contents into the Windows\nsystem to either optimize usage or memory,\n\n308\n00:15:57.364 --> 00:16:01.810\nstored data that's often and pull back\non the memory contention conditions.\n\n309\n00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.809\nLots of reasons why page\nfiles may get used.\n\n310\n00:16:03.809 --> 00:16:05.122\nSo we want to go after that file.\n\n311\n00:16:05.122 --> 00:16:09.457\nAnd remember that the page file while\ntraditionally may be in a normal path can\n\n312\n00:16:09.457 --> 00:16:11.200\nbe modified and moved around.\n\n313\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.380\nWe can put it in an alternate location,\nwe may have a different hard\n\n314\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.580\ndrive in the system we page into, we may\nhave on certain drive and not on others.\n\n315\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.260\nThere’s a lot of variables there so\nlooking for\n\n316\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.140\nthe registry key tells us\nwhere it is authoritatively.\n\n317\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.060\nWould be a good idea for us to do.\n\n318\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.480\nAnd again a registry editor,\nright, so regedit, or\n\n319\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.020\nregedit32, just like this, right?\n\n320\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:35.570\nGoing in and being able to interact\nwith the registry editor and\n\n321\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.440\njust going in and looking for\nthe appropriate registry path in this case\n\n322\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.740\nwould tell us quite a bit about where\nwe wanna be and what we wanna find.\n\n323\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.380\nSo you wanna be thinking about that.\n\n324\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.480\nMaking sure we're familiar with\nhow to use the registry editor.\n\n325\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.440\nYou have a preference, Daniel,\nto registry editors, do you care?\n\n326\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.850\n&gt;&gt; I just use Regedit usually.\n\n327\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Regedit, okay,\nI usually like that one as well.\n\n328\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.170\nYou can do a lot of, it's easier,\n\n329\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.670\nit's got a little bit more advanced\nsearch features and capabilities.\n\n330\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.230\nI prefer that one as well.\n\n331\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.130\nDo keep in mind, I know we've talked\nabout this in other discussions,\n\n332\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.360\nmaybe not necessarily been in our\ndiscussion here, but the register is one\n\n333\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.480\nof those interesting tools that is a very\nvaluable tool for the investigator.\n\n334\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.920\nBut it's one of those tools that you\ncould easily turn on yourself if you're\n\n335\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.870\nnot careful.\n\n336\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.920\nMeaning, there's no safety on this thing.\n\n337\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.145\nYou can shoot yourself in the foot,\nbecause any time you go in there, if you\n\n338\n00:17:17.145 --> 00:17:21.025\nmake a change to a value that change is\nwritten back to the system immediately.\n\n339\n00:17:21.025 --> 00:17:24.055\nThere's no oops I didn't\nmean to do that undo arrow.\n\n340\n00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:27.805\nThere's no prompt like are you sure you\nreally wanna change that value to zero and\n\n341\n00:17:27.805 --> 00:17:29.085\nshut the system off, right?\n\n342\n00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:33.685\nIt just does, so it's a live editor\nwith absolutely zero safeties, right?\n\n343\n00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:36.780\nThere's no constraints,\nno restraints of any kind.\n\n344\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.590\nThe nice thing about the gooey\ntraditionally in most OS's,\n\n345\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.720\nis it's programmed specifically\nto prevent you from harming you,\n\n346\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.500\nharming the system and\nor you harming yourself.\n\n347\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.050\nWe at least weil cause you to pause\nlong enough to make sure you're\n\n348\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.670\ngoing to opt in by saying yes\na lot of the times, right?\n\n349\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.150\nIn the registry editor,\nwe don't get that capability.\n\n350\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.020\nIt just does what we ask it to do.\n\n351\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.620\nSo it is a tool that's incredibly\npowerful but with all tools right comes\n\n352\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.920\nproper amount of respect and\nknowledge about how to wield it.\n\n353\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.120\nSo just make sure you're aware of that and\nyou're thinking about that.\n\n354\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.380\nAll right in addition, searching for\ninformation that may be in indices.\n\n355\n00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.890\nWe index a lot of\ninformation in the system.\n\n356\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.100\nKnowing where to find that,\nlooking at hiding partition information\n\n357\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.110\nThese will be valuable ideas for\nyou to consider as well.\n\n358\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.430\nGot some URLs here that may be helpful for\nyou.\n\n359\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.480\nSearch Index Examiner,\nanother tool that may be valuable.\n\n360\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.970\nThis lets you go in, pull information out\nof the Windows Desktop Search database.\n\n361\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.050\nA lot of times if we're using the index\nservice, the search service and\n\n362\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.000\nindex service in Windows\nto speed up our searches\n\n363\n00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.790\nwe have a full database that's\nbeing kept behind the scenes.\n\n364\n00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.020\nBut the OS itself is constantly updating.\n\n365\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.010\nReferencing all the files and\nthe directories and\n\n366\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.390\neverything that's in the system.\n\n367\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.350\nGreat source of information\nauthoritatively for us.\n\n368\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.020\nWhat's there.\n\n369\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:47.940\nWhen it was put there.\n\n370\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.600\nWho accessed it.\n\n371\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.550\nAll that stuff's in that database.\n\n372\n00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.510\nWe can pull that using a tool like this.\n\n373\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.920\nThis does cost a bit of money.\n\n374\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.350\nThose are US dollars by the way.\n\n375\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.220\nSo that's in US dollars.\n\n376\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.820\nAnd again, your pricing is relative.\n\n377\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.550\nCan't tell you that it's going to cost\nthat when you go to look at this episode.\n\n378\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.080\nIt just happens to be what it costs when I\npulled it up on the website this morning.\n\n379\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.260\nPricing notwithstanding, a tool like this\nmay be valuable for you to consider.\n\n380\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.610\nThe URL is in the notes.\n\n381\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.820\nAlso Partition Logic lets you go in.\n\n382\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.950\nAn oldie but a goodie.\n\n383\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.610\nBeen around forever and a day.\n\n384\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.460\nMany of the drive editors\nthat are out there,\n\n385\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.830\nregards to what they are,\nwill be available to you.\n\n386\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.345\nThis one's a bit old, as you can see,\nbest products of 2008.\n\n387\n00:19:24.345 --> 00:19:26.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a little bit dated, but\n\n388\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.430\nyou know, again, I like older tools that\nhave been around awhile that are tested.\n\n389\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.510\nAnd as long as I can fast forward\nthem into the environment I'm in and\n\n390\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.900\nthey work, yeah,\nI see no reason to get rid of them, right?\n\n391\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.100\nI'd rather use an old tried and\n\n392\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.750\ntested tool than one that's brand new\nthat I gotta figure out how to use again.\n\n393\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.430\nAnd I may or may not understand how\nit works and what it does, right?\n\n394\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.780\nAnd so I'm not suggesting that,\nwell I guess I am suggesting right?\n\n395\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That I am old-fashioned,\n\n396\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.990\nI like what I like, and\neverybody can say that.\n\n397\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.680\nBut my point with this is in particular,\nnot that this tool among others.\n\n398\n00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.840\nThere's a million partition errors,\nchoose the one you want.\n\n399\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.520\nI don't really care what you use and\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n400\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.780\nAll I'm pointing out is that the criteria\nfor selecting a tool for an investigator\n\n401\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.260\nshould be tools you´re comfortable with,\nthat you understand well enough\n\n402\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.180\nto know how they work, and know what does\nand does not happen when you use them.\n\n403\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.480\nIf that´s the most recent and brand\nnew version of the tool, good for you.\n\n404\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.080\nIf it´s a tool that´s older and\nyou´re more comfortable with that one,\n\n405\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.870\nas long as it works in the OS.\n\n406\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.980\nAs long as it does its job, as long as\nyou're familiar with its quirks and\n\n407\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.790\nyou can make it work for you,\nI think it's a great choice.\n\n408\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.940\nWhat I'm suggesting is you have to be\ncomfortable enough in your own skin,\n\n409\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.180\nwith your own tools, to do your job.\n\n410\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.190\nAnd not be constantly referring to the\nowner's manual every time you make a click\n\n411\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.940\nand say, okay, what happens next?\n\n412\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.840\nThat's not a good tool.\n\n413\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.610\nThat's not a good choice.\n\n414\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.440\nBecause it's not gonna work the right way,\nand\n\n415\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.090\nyou're gonna wind up screwing up\nthe evidence before you figure it out.\n\n416\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.500\nSo whatever tool you use, just make sure\nyou know how to use it the right way.\n\n417\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.260\nThat's all.\n\n418\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.130\nI don't care what tool you use,\nnobody does.\n\n419\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.290\nNobody is gonna laugh at you for\nusing an old tool.\n\n420\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.050\nYou know what if they do, they probably\ndon't know how to use tools and\n\n421\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.160\nthey are probably laughing at you\njust because they don't understand.\n\n422\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.135\nBecause they don't know how to use them.\n\n423\n00:20:57.135 --> 00:20:58.940\nSo you could turn around and\n\n424\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.340\ntell them that your making the right\ndecisions using the right tools and\n\n425\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.330\nhave them show you the tool they use and\nbet you they wont be able to because\n\n426\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.730\nthose people tend to not have the kind\nof knowledge we're talking about.\n\n427\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.110\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n428\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.070\nNo cyber bullying.\n\n429\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.083\n[CROSSTALK] Web browser,\ncache, cookies, temp files,\n\n430\n00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:16.041\nall sorts of stuff important there.\n\n431\n00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.205\nWhat about Windows thumbnail caches right?\n\n432\n00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:21.815\nWe have the thumbcache.db file or\nthe desktop.db.\n\n433\n00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:25.110\nThere's all sorts of different db files,\ncache files that you see.\n\n434\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.090\nIn Window's 10.\n\n435\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.790\nSame location as Windows 7.\n\n436\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.860\nRight so, whatever the username is.\n\n437\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.320\nApp data local,\nMicrosoft Windows Explorer.\n\n438\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.090\nYou'll find it there.\n\n439\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.120\nWhat do you find there?\n\n440\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.760\nWell all sorts of stuff that may\nbe on the desktop or may not be.\n\n441\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.240\nInformation that would be valuable\nthat you want to be aware of.\n\n442\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.600\nAgain, what we're doing is picking\napart the OS piece by piece, right?\n\n443\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.470\nWe're looking at al\nthese different places,\n\n444\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.410\nwhere we can find this information and\nput it to use.\n\n445\n00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.060\nhow do we pull this data out?\n\n446\n00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.070\nHow do we use it?\n\n447\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.040\nHow do we find it?\n\n448\n00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.110\nWhere is it, again if we do a full scale\ncapture of this system live running,\n\n449\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.860\nand you know get all the dynamic data,\n\n450\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.720\nall the volatile data, do a complete\nimage dump out of the system.\n\n451\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.850\nWe're going to have all this stuff,\n\n452\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.950\nall we have to now if go\nback into those image files.\n\n453\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.960\nStart cherry picking the data we want.\n\n454\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.660\nBut if we don't know where the data is.\n\n455\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.170\nIt's laying there these hidden gems\nthat we have to uncover and use.\n\n456\n00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.370\nBut if we as investigators are not aware\nof their location we're not going to be\n\n457\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.230\nable to extract them and obviously\nget the value out of that data and\n\n458\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.520\nunderstand what it is.\n\n459\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.410\nSo it's important for\nus to be aware of these things.\n\n460\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.670\nImportant for you to be aware of them.\n\n461\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.210\nMaybe asked about them on an exam.\n\n462\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.360\nAlways good to know about it for\nthat purpose.\n\n463\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.160\nIn the real world, doing this job out in\nthe wild, have to know about this stuff.\n\n464\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.310\nYou are going to have to go in and\nexamine Windows Systems.\n\n465\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.680\nYour are going to have to know\nwhere to look and what to look for.\n\n466\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.190\nThese file are going to be important.\n\n467\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.050\nWe've talked on memory and\nthe dumping of dynamic memory.\n\n468\n00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.510\nIve shown you a couple of different\ntools and ways you can do this.\n\n469\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.350\nMicrosoft has a nice support\nfile on how to do a memory dump.\n\n470\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.270\nIt's a little dated,\n\n471\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:52.680\nbut still give you pretty good information\nabout how to do a complete memory dump.\n\n472\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.610\nSo I would suggest to take a look at this.\n\n473\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.330\nGoes through and explains to you the dos\nand don't and what's involved here.\n\n474\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.120\nSo it goes through,\ntalks about the paging file.\n\n475\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.590\nWe just talked about that.\n\n476\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.620\nHow to go in and get a complete dump,\ngives you the steps involved.\n\n477\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.060\nAdjust obviously for the vagaries of your\nspecific OS, maybe in a different area,\n\n478\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.240\nthat kind of thing.\n\n479\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.180\nBoot configuration data editor,\ngreat tool for\n\n480\n00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.780\nyou to take a look at as well,\nhelps you to go and find more information.\n\n481\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.600\nSo a little bit new behavior in\nsome of the newer OSes ,talks\n\n482\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.430\nabout some of the newer\nthings that are happening.\n\n483\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.010\nSo it's a really good file,\nor a really good web URL,\n\n484\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.890\nrather, to reference, to take a look at.\n\n485\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.610\nSo you may want to go in and\ntake a look at that.\n\n486\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.762\nWhy it keeps doing that?\n\n487\n00:23:31.762 --> 00:23:33.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I go to a different window it\n\n488\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.180\nkinda just resets.\n\n489\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.920\nMaybe if I click and then minimize\ninstead of just leaving it up.\n\n490\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Also,\n\n491\n00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.320\nyou know what I'm a big proponent,\nespecially in Windows, in any OS.\n\n492\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.210\nLinux is the same way.\n\n493\n00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.460\nThe Mac OS the same way.\n\n494\n00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.370\nI just spend a lot more time working with\nWindows and Linux than I do the MAC OS.\n\n495\n00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.760\nI'm not as knowledgable\nby my own admission,\n\n496\n00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.570\nI'm not the guy you want to call\nwhen you have a MAC OS question.\n\n497\n00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.662\nI could tell you what not to do to break\nit, I can't tell you necessarily how to\n\n498\n00:23:56.662 --> 00:23:59.518\nforensically carve it apart and\nput it back together again with the same\n\n499\n00:23:59.518 --> 00:24:01.444\nconfidence level I have for\nWindows and Linux.\n\n500\n00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:03.690\nI could do that with my eyes closed,\nright?\n\n501\n00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.925\nSo while we'll talk about it towards the\nend of our conversations in this set of\n\n502\n00:24:06.925 --> 00:24:09.923\nepisodes And I'll certainly will\ngive you some valuable information.\n\n503\n00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:11.100\nThere are specialist out there.\n\n504\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.799\nPeople that do nothing but that.\n\n505\n00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.513\nAnd you wanna talk with those people.\n\n506\n00:24:14.513 --> 00:24:16.527\nBut on the Windows side in particular,\n\n507\n00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:19.525\nI'm a huge proponent of\nlooking at the program model.\n\n508\n00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:21.220\nUnderstanding the object references,\n\n509\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.330\nunderstanding in other words\nthe underlying code and how it works.\n\n510\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.940\nCuz I think that makes you\na better forensic investigator,\n\n511\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.250\nbetter forensic examiner.\n\n512\n00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.390\nBetter security professional,\nbetter network admin overall.\n\n513\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:36.260\nJust a better operational person to\nbe hands on in this environment.\n\n514\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.770\nI feel strongly about Linux.\n\n515\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.704\nAnd as I said,\nif I spent enough time on the Mac OS,\n\n516\n00:24:39.704 --> 00:24:41.099\nI'd tell you to do it there as well.\n\n517\n00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:43.420\nIn other words, you've got to go\nout there and get your hands dirty.\n\n518\n00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.150\nRoll up your sleeves.\n\n519\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.950\nLook at the vendor documentation.\n\n520\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.354\nAnd in the Windows case there's\nthe whole sys admin side and\n\n521\n00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:51.990\nthen there's the whole developer side.\n\n522\n00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.880\nWhere the object class model references\nare listed and you gotta delve into both\n\n523\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.440\nsides of this documentation to\ntruly understand what we're doing.\n\n524\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.480\nThe kernel opaque structures\ndocument I put up here from\n\n525\n00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.280\nTechNet is a good example of this.\n\n526\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.380\nLet's just take a look real quick,\ntry this a slightly different way.\n\n527\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.420\nThere we go.\nYou know,\n\n528\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.290\nthis gives us the eprocess information,\nall the associated opaque\n\n529\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.020\nstructures that form the structures\nthat let processes run in Windows.\n\n530\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.970\nThis is how we build the memory spaces and\nhow we, we don't even think about it.\n\n531\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.860\nWe go to run line and\nwinword.exe, iexplore.exe.\n\n532\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.384\nMSTSC to launch a command or\na terminal session.\n\n533\n00:25:31.384 --> 00:25:32.950\nOr CMD to launch command, or whatever.\n\n534\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.970\nAnything we do, you just take that for\ngranted, it works.\n\n535\n00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:41.030\nThere is a lot of turning gears,\nand belts, and drives and bells and\n\n536\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.810\nwhistles that just kick into motion\nbehind the scenes you never see, right?\n\n537\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.059\nAnd all that stuff has to be examined and\nunderstood.\n\n538\n00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:50.806\nAnd the interaction of how those things\ncome together to essentially give us\n\n539\n00:25:50.806 --> 00:25:52.280\na interactive environment.\n\n540\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.550\nGive us that command line,\nopen a terminal session, load Word and\n\n541\n00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.090\nlet you edit a document, whatever.\n\n542\n00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.520\nThose things have to happen in\nmemory spaces with process IDs\n\n543\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.380\nassociated with them and a bunch of stuff.\n\n544\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.461\nUnderstanding that examination\nof that structure which is what\n\n545\n00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:08.571\nthe Windows Kernel Opaque structures are,\n\n546\n00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.919\nhelps you to be a better\nforensic investigator.\n\n547\n00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:14.590\nBecause you want to get into this, you\nwant to understand what somebody's doing.\n\n548\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.360\nHow they're manipulating system calls, you\ngotta understand the stuff on this screen.\n\n549\n00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.519\nYou gotta know what the eprocesses are.\n\n550\n00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:22.613\nAnd you've gotta understand\nhow to track them and\n\n551\n00:26:22.613 --> 00:26:25.570\nwhy the processes are created\nthe way they are.\n\n552\n00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.268\nAnd there's eprocess, there's ethread,\n\n553\n00:26:29.268 --> 00:26:33.850\nthere's xrundown ref,\nxtimer, fast Mutex, IoCSQ.\n\n554\n00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.790\nYou can see all these different ones here.\n\n555\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.120\nWork items these describe work items for\na system worker thread.\n\n556\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.020\nYou gotta be able to\ntrack everything through.\n\n557\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.810\nAnd I'm not suggesting that\nas an investigator you're\n\n558\n00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.920\ngonna understand every one of\nthese things and work with them.\n\n559\n00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.910\nBut the tools that we use to read memory\nwill give us this kind of information by\n\n560\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.900\nexamining these process elements.\n\n561\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.550\nYou gotta understand what you're\ngetting and where they're coming from.\n\n562\n00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.770\nReading up on this a little bit,\n\n563\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.020\nin other words, makes the tools\nthat you use make a lot more sense.\n\n564\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.890\nBecause the executive process,\nwe'll call the eprocess\n\n565\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.340\nblock structure that essentially\nwe're breaking down for you here.\n\n566\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.150\nThis is how we actually go in and\n\n567\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.450\nlook at all the information\nthat's in volatile memory.\n\n568\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.940\nThe process ID,\nthe PID that we were talking about, so\n\n569\n00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.560\nthink in Linux UNIX, list, top, proc,\nif you're familiar with those tools.\n\n570\n00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.650\nYou're getting a complete list of\nall running system processes, right?\n\n571\n00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.840\nTop just shows you the top usage,\nkind of hierarchically top down.\n\n572\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.510\nProc just shows you all the processes.\n\n573\n00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.960\nEssentially like lists, right?\n\n574\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.150\nYou look at any of those,\nyou're gonna see a lot of this data,\n\n575\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.760\nthe equivalent in the system\ncalls in Linux and UNIX.\n\n576\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.480\nBeing presented to you in a command shell.\n\n577\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.170\nYou gotta be able to interpret that,\nright?\n\n578\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.650\nWhat's the memory allocation?\n\n579\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.470\nWhat's the process ID?\n\n580\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.240\nWhere's it running?\n\n581\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.060\nWhat's it doing?\n\n582\n00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.240\nHow long has it been there?\n\n583\n00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.670\nWhat account or\nwhat alias is it running under?\n\n584\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.080\nWhat's the execution path?\n\n585\n00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.910\nGotta know all this kind of stuff, right?\n\n586\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.890\nWhat's the pointer for the loader data to\ntell you where it's being executed from?\n\n587\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.530\nThis includes the pointer references and\nthe DLLs being used by the processes.\n\n588\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.640\nWhat's the image base address for\nmemory access?\n\n589\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.890\nWhat is the process parameter structure?\n\n590\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.310\nAll these things are coming to\nus out of the eprocess blocks.\n\n591\n00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.710\nBut if we don't understand those things,\nhow are we possibly gonna make sense of\n\n592\n00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.506\nthem from a forensics\ninvestigative standpoint?\n\n593\n00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:14.208\nAnd so knowledge of this kind of\ninformation, incredibly important,\n\n594\n00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:17.090\nincredibly valuable as\na forensic investigator.\n\n595\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.630\nYou've gotta go in and use this knowledge.\n\n596\n00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:20.510\nHow would you apply it?\n\n597\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.340\nTools like the Microsoft Debug Toolset.\n\n598\n00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.110\nAgain, one of those tools we\noften are kind of ignoring and\n\n599\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.360\njust not thinking about because that's for\ndevelopers, right?\n\n600\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.540\nWe don't look at that stuff.\n\n601\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.780\nThat's what support tells us to\nuse to read the memory dump files.\n\n602\n00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.830\nI don't understand what's in there\nanyway I never look at that.\n\n603\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.200\nWell that's the stuff you gotta look\nat if you're an investigator cuz\n\n604\n00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.710\nthat's where all the data is.\n\n605\n00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.500\nYou gotta download those debug tool sets,\nload the file in, that's how you read\n\n606\n00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.430\nthe crash dump or memory dump\nfile you use the debug tool set.\n\n607\n00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.210\nIt gives you the character display and\nthe information to translate so\n\n608\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.060\ncould see what's in there.\n\n609\n00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.000\nAre you gonna understand everything?\n\n610\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.440\nNo, you're not gonna\nunderstand everything.\n\n611\n00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.720\nMost of it is just garbage gibberish\nthat you need Microsoft or\n\n612\n00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.210\nthe vendor to interpret for you.\n\n613\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.470\nBut is there data in there\nthat will be helpful?\n\n614\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.292\nAbsolutely, something like Live KD,\none of the Kali Linux tool sets,\n\n615\n00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:08.280\nor just a forensics tool that you could\nload up would give you this information.\n\n616\n00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.900\nSo for example, and I know we're getting\nclose to our time frame here, but\n\n617\n00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.640\nlet me just show you one thing here.\n\n618\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:21.440\nSo let's say for instance that,\nWe went in and loaded Helix, right?\n\n619\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.980\nHelix, Knoppix, these are bootable\nLinux distros, just move this over so\n\n620\n00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.160\nyou can see this, that are live.\n\n621\n00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.690\nThey run inside of the OS.\n\n622\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.805\nYou put them in, they create a RAM drive,\nessentially a memory drive, and\n\n623\n00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:35.687\nyou can run them or run them off\na DVD depending on what you're doing.\n\n624\n00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:39.020\nSo if I load Helix,\njust run this as an administrator,\n\n625\n00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.850\nright, this is a forensics\nversion of Linux.\n\n626\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.790\nA little bit older and dated at this\npoint, but still usable, right?\n\n627\n00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.371\nSo hit Accept.\n\n628\n00:29:49.302 --> 00:29:50.990\nGotta love those graphics.\n\n629\n00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.127\nThe slow fade, right?\n\n630\n00:29:52.127 --> 00:29:53.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the dissolve [LAUGH].\n\n631\n00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.210\n&gt;&gt; So you can see general\nsystem information, right?\n\n632\n00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.470\nProfiles lets me go in.\n\n633\n00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.890\nDo live acquisition of data.\n\n634\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.360\nI can capture memory.\n\n635\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.860\nI can capture, not just the memory.\n\n636\n00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.190\nBut I can capture the physical disk.\n\n637\n00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.964\nSo I can go in,\ndo a live capture using DD.\n\n638\n00:30:07.964 --> 00:30:09.990\nI can see image DD there.\n\n639\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.330\nOr I can use another tool, right?\n\n640\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.800\nI can use AccessData's FTK.\n\n641\n00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.360\nYou've seen me use this\ntool in prior episodes.\n\n642\n00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.562\nYou'll see it come up again later.\n\n643\n00:30:18.562 --> 00:30:21.610\nI've shown you how to use this\ntool as a standalone in Windows.\n\n644\n00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.490\nI could do Windows Forensics Toolkit.\n\n645\n00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:24.920\nThis is dated at this point.\n\n646\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.530\nThis is for older systems.\n\n647\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.590\nBut the Windows Forensics tool chest,\nFirst Responder Utilities,\n\n648\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.800\ncollection reports,\nrisk management, right?\n\n649\n00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.510\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n650\n00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.050\nNetcat is a listener.\n\n651\n00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.120\nYou're familiar with Netcat.\n\n652\n00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.460\nI'm sure you use that all the time.\n\n653\n00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.105\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n654\n00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:39.121\n&gt;&gt; And not for nefarious means or\nreasons at all.\n\n655\n00:30:39.121 --> 00:30:40.810\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n656\n00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.770\n&gt;&gt; You could browse the contents\nof one of the drives.\n\n657\n00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.930\nGo in and take a look here in real time.\n\n658\n00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.370\nWe could go in and search for\nand scan for pictures.\n\n659\n00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.560\nI can load a folder.\n\n660\n00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.350\nLooking for\nsteganographic images and files.\n\n661\n00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.150\nWhen we talk about steganography\nin some upcoming episodes,\n\n662\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.970\nwe'll show you how to manipulate images.\n\n663\n00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.150\nLook at white space and\nmanipulate all that.\n\n664\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.930\nSo a tool like this would be\nvaluable to do a memory capture.\n\n665\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.440\nAnd we could do that and\nlook at the output\n\n666\n00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.750\nof the eprocess blocks that I was talking\nabout with a tool like this in Windows.\n\n667\n00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.850\nAgain if we do a full capture and\n\n668\n00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.300\nhave all that dynamic data,\nwe can load the files and do this offline.\n\n669\n00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.980\nWe don't have to do it\nlive on the machine.\n\n670\n00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.900\nBut we have to be able to capture\nthat forensics data properly\n\n671\n00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.400\nin order to be able to do this, right?\n\n672\n00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.450\nSo when we think about the steps\ninvolved in being able\n\n673\n00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.260\nto think about what a process does\nas it's created and then executed.\n\n674\n00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.140\nLet me just quickly run through those as\nwe wrap up cuz I know we're just about of\n\n675\n00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.980\ntime on this episode, but\nwe were talking about process.\n\n676\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.120\nI just wanna wrap up this\nparticular discussion.\n\n677\n00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.560\nWe're talking about executive process or\neprocess block structures.\n\n678\n00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.015\nTalked about the different tools.\n\n679\n00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:44.990\nCould we go full screen just so you could\nsee this a little bit easier for me?\n\n680\n00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.980\nThat way I don't have to keep\nmoving around and dodging stuff.\n\n681\n00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.710\nBut you can see here the steps I broke\ndown for you, how a process is created and\n\n682\n00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.630\nwhat they are.\n\n683\n00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.594\nThe image, whatever the executable\nfile is, will be opened, right?\n\n684\n00:31:56.594 --> 00:32:00.400\nThe appropriate subsystems, whatever\nthey are, are gonna be identified.\n\n685\n00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.322\nWe actually create the reg key and\ncheck to see what our instructions may be.\n\n686\n00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.348\nAnd then the process starts.\n\n687\n00:32:05.348 --> 00:32:08.758\nThe process block, the object is created.\n\n688\n00:32:08.758 --> 00:32:13.170\nThe KProcess block, the kernel\nprocess block, the environment block.\n\n689\n00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.400\nAll these blocks are broken out and\ncreated to support the running process.\n\n690\n00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.081\nThe initial threads are created for\nexecution.\n\n691\n00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:24.196\nThe subsystem in Windows, this is Windows\nspecific notified of the new process and\n\n692\n00:32:24.196 --> 00:32:28.700\nthread along with the PID, process ID and\nwhatever flags are associated with it.\n\n693\n00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.090\nWe begin to execute the initial thread.\n\n694\n00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.410\nProcess environment is up and running\nat that point, resources allocated.\n\n695\n00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.450\nThis will be the same discussion if you\ntook out the word Windows, by the way.\n\n696\n00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:42.260\nIn Linux Unix we would just kind of smooth\nover those operating system specifics.\n\n697\n00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.030\nAnd generically talk about the fact\nwe allocate blocks and memory.\n\n698\n00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.580\nWe then create threads.\n\n699\n00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.040\nWe then check for validity, security, etc.\n\n700\n00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.440\nWe execute those threads in the OS.\n\n701\n00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.510\nAnd we begin to track and\n\n702\n00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:59.280\nuse the output of that to drive\nwhatever the process represents.\n\n703\n00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.970\nWe map all that in memory.\n\n704\n00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.800\nSo, the initialization of the address base\nis completed, meaning memory is allocated.\n\n705\n00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.700\nWe're able to now execute the process,\n\n706\n00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.930\nwork with it within dedicated\nreserve memory spaces.\n\n707\n00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.790\nAnd so, this is how we actually\nare able to track all of that and\n\n708\n00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.230\nhow we're able to understand\nthe process flow.\n\n709\n00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.850\nAnd when we do that, if we wanna,\nagain, just another way of looking at\n\n710\n00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.135\nprocess flow, maybe you wanna go in and\nmaybe you want to dump that memory.\n\n711\n00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:25.367\nNot use some of the tools\nI've already shown you.\n\n712\n00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:29.104\nPerhaps you had another tool right that\nyou can go in and parse memory with,\n\n713\n00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:32.780\nagain this is an older tool set but\none that could be valuable for you.\n\n714\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.898\nYou'll see here on source forge Windows IR\nCf tools, the forensics analysis tools.\n\n715\n00:33:37.898 --> 00:33:41.669\nYou can actually go in, there's a memory\ndump here tool for Windows 2000,\n\n716\n00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:43.420\nit does work on newer versions.\n\n717\n00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.700\nBut not all the way through to Windows 10.\n\n718\n00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.066\nOnly on some of the older versions,\nup through Vista, Windows 7.\n\n719\n00:33:48.066 --> 00:33:51.030\nBut you can use some of these older\ntools as well to do memory dumps.\n\n720\n00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.847\nProbably about five or six different\ntools we've shown you that can be used to\n\n721\n00:33:54.847 --> 00:33:58.324\ndo memory dumps to get this kind of\ninformation in one form or another.\n\n722\n00:33:58.324 --> 00:34:01.858\nThere's also a bunch of Perl scripts,\njust as we're wrapping up,\n\n723\n00:34:01.858 --> 00:34:04.958\nthat can be used as well, for\nyou to go in and to dump memory.\n\n724\n00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:06.350\nThere's another URL.\n\n725\n00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.560\nAgain, these are in the notes.\n\n726\n00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.020\nWhere you can go in,\nthere was an older set of tools.\n\n727\n00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.843\nVery famous for awhile in Windows,\n\n728\n00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:14.406\nthat were used as Perl\nscripts that could be used.\n\n729\n00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:18.021\nAnd there was a nice graphical\noverlay that was created for\n\n730\n00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:20.174\nthe Perl scripts that you can use.\n\n731\n00:34:20.174 --> 00:34:22.380\nA gentleman named Andreas Schuster.\n\n732\n00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.030\nCreated the PT finder tools and\nthose were very valuable,\n\n733\n00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.460\nvery famous,\nback in the early days of Windows.\n\n734\n00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.940\nThere's a front end,\nthat was created by a guy named McGowan,\n\n735\n00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.930\nI hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly.\n\n736\n00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:38.510\nBut, forensiczoneblogspot.com,\nyou could see the URL for that.\n\n737\n00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.000\nSo, you could go in and you can use it.\n\n738\n00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.490\nThere was a ram tool,\nsome other tools that were there.\n\n739\n00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:47.218\nSo, the Perl scripts that I talked about,\nand I have in the notes, are here.\n\n740\n00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:50.788\nlsproc.pl, there some information\nabout it and how it would work.\n\n741\n00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:54.963\nYou would see the output\nhere of what it does.\n\n742\n00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:56.292\nThere is lspd.pl,\n\n743\n00:34:56.292 --> 00:35:01.590\nthis allows you to look at the detailed\nlisting of all process information.\n\n744\n00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.596\nWhat these Perl scripts are doing\nis the equivalent of plist\n\n745\n00:35:05.596 --> 00:35:07.848\nas a Sysinternals tool does now.\n\n746\n00:35:07.848 --> 00:35:12.125\nEssentially goes into\nthe non-graphical editor, right?\n\n747\n00:35:12.125 --> 00:35:16.063\nIt essentially just binds to the Windows\nprocesses in memory, dumps them, but\n\n748\n00:35:16.063 --> 00:35:18.090\ngives you a view of the task manager.\n\n749\n00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.170\nAnd some of the GUI tools will not show\nyou about just all the information.\n\n750\n00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.230\nIt shows you how they\nwill be available here.\n\n751\n00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.430\nSo you can see as we scroll\nthrough this listing.\n\n752\n00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.360\nJust all the different Perl\nscripts that are available and\n\n753\n00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.580\nthe ways in which they can be used.\n\n754\n00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.130\nI would recommend that you think\nabout taking a look at them.\n\n755\n00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.530\nThey are valuable.\n\n756\n00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.844\nThey're not used as often today\nespecially depending on what it is that\n\n757\n00:35:38.844 --> 00:35:41.731\nyou're looking at,\nwhat version of Windows, how old it is.\n\n758\n00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:44.975\nA lot of people when they fear\nthe Windows Command Shell fear PowerShell,\n\n759\n00:35:44.975 --> 00:35:47.400\nfear Perl as well because\nit's a script environment.\n\n760\n00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.360\nYou gotta be able to\nunderstand the Perl language,\n\n761\n00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.650\nthe scripting language to run it.\n\n762\n00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.456\nA lot of Windows admins do,\nbut many do not.\n\n763\n00:35:53.456 --> 00:35:56.000\nAnd it just may not be\nyour tool of choice.\n\n764\n00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.780\nBut remember,\nthe more options we have, right?\n\n765\n00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.440\nThe more capabilities\nwe bring to the party,\n\n766\n00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.040\nthe more likely it is we're\ngonna find information of value.\n\n767\n00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.501\nSo this may yet be just another way for\nyou to find something that may be\n\n768\n00:36:05.501 --> 00:36:08.675\nworthwhile, and to examine\nthe contents of memory all right.\n\n769\n00:36:08.675 --> 00:36:12.805\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully by now you guys\nare understanding that this is one of\n\n770\n00:36:12.805 --> 00:36:14.587\nthe larger domains in CHFI.\n\n771\n00:36:14.587 --> 00:36:16.846\nAnd now you're gonna understand\nwhy that actually is.\n\n772\n00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:19.964\nThere's a lot of information when it\ncomes to operating system forensics,\n\n773\n00:36:19.964 --> 00:36:21.387\ninside of Windows specifically.\n\n774\n00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:24.762\nWe could probably make a whole mini\nseries, to be honest with you,\n\n775\n00:36:24.762 --> 00:36:26.102\non doing that very thing.\n\n776\n00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:27.992\nBut thank goodness we don't have to\n\n777\n00:36:27.992 --> 00:36:28.612\nknow every\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n778\n00:36:28.612 --> 00:36:29.813\n&gt;&gt; Single detail about\n\n779\n00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.440\ndoing that to get our CHFI.\n\n780\n00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.360\nSo, definitely continue on with us, we\nhave more to come, we haven't even touched\n\n781\n00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.570\non Linux and Mac operating systems,\nand other things as well.\n\n782\n00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.920\nSo, join back with us,\nwe will be covering those things.\n\n783\n00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.620\nAs for this episode,\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n784\n00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.153\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n785\n00:36:46.153 -->

00:00:10.667\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.840\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.300\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.980\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.400\nwe are continuing on with more on\non our CHFI version nine series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.340\nActually, you're taking\na further look into the abyss,\n\n9\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.420\nthat is Operating System Forensics.\n\n10\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.670\nAnd joining us yet again, our deep-diver\nhimself, our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.880\nAdam, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nYou know, funny you should\n\n13\n00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.765\nmention the abyss.\n\n14\n00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:39.137\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually I chose to watch, re-watch,\n\n15\n00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:41.532\nthat movie on-\n&gt;&gt; It's a great flick.\n\n16\n00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:42.857\n&gt;&gt; My flight,\none of the movies I got to see.\n\n17\n00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:43.775\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Love that movie.\n\n18\n00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:44.752\n&gt;&gt; I saw, like literally,\nI saw like 12 movies.\n\n19\n00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:46.978\n&gt;&gt; Because you had a long flight.\n\n20\n00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:48.626\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was like 14 hours,\nminimally 14 each way.\n\n21\n00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.810\n&gt;&gt; That was just the part between here and\nKorea.\n\n23\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.720\nNot to mention-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.210\n&gt;&gt; The five hours from Korea\n\n25\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.050\nover to Hanoi.\n\n26\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.768\n&gt;&gt; You were thanking the God above.\n\n27\n00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:01.956\n&gt;&gt; I was, but among the many movies\nI actually saw, I watched The Abyss.\n\n28\n00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.055\n&gt;&gt; That's a great flick.\n\n29\n00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:05.333\nI love the movie.\n\n30\n00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.250\n&gt;&gt; It was very good, very good.\n\n31\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.040\nA lot of cool stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.010\nSo we are gonna dive deeply,\n\n33\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.810\nas Daniel suggested,\ninto operating system forensics.\n\n34\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.170\nWe have already actually been taking\na look at some of the deeper,\n\n35\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.490\ndarker waters surrounding Windows and\nhow we deal with forensics.\n\n36\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.210\nWe're gonna continue, I thought it\nwould be cool to go into PowerShell.\n\n37\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.385\nWe've talked a lot about PowerShell.\n\n38\n00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:25.400\nWe talked about how we can use it,\n\n39\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.250\nI thought I'd put together a little script\nfor you, show you how we could extract\n\n40\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.735\nprocess information memory,\nworking set information.\n\n41\n00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:33.610\nA couple of lines of script, no big deal.\n\n42\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.140\nDaniel actually just typed this up from\nthe notes real quick cause we changed\n\n43\n00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.140\nthe script we were gonna use.\n\n44\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.050\nSwapped it out for this particular one,\n\n45\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.010\na little shorter,\na little bit easier to work with.\n\n46\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.642\nTook him all of what,\na minute or two right?\n\n47\n00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:45.790\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't real hard, and\n\n48\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.665\nhe was reading it right off the screen,\njust had a transpose it.\n\n49\n00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:50.770\nSo let's take a look real quick,\nand show you what it does.\n\n50\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.809\nYou can see here, can we go full screen\njust to narrate through this real quick.\n\n51\n00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.464\nSo you can here that when we take a look\nat PowerShell, I'm gonna run this for\n\n52\n00:01:58.464 --> 00:01:59.480\nyou in Powershell.\n\n53\n00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.252\nJust a minute we'll\nhave it teed up in ISE,\n\n54\n00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:02.893\nwe'll just take a look at what it does.\n\n55\n00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.069\nBut we'll start with\na Get Process command.\n\n56\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.410\nGet a list of all the running\nprocesses in the system.\n\n57\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.640\nPipe that to a sort object for\nthe working set for 64-bit processes.\n\n58\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.410\nSelect from that, and we're gonna select\nthe name and then go ahead and pull\n\n59\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.130\nall the working processes in the working\nset 64, list them, get their memory.\n\n60\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.620\nIncrement the memory or\nshow it in one kilobit slices.\n\n61\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.820\nSo if we have a number five there for\n\n62\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.270\nthe working set five k memory, number ten\nten kilobit of memory, that kind of thing.\n\n63\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.280\nPipe that all out once we get done\nworking all the magic in there\n\n64\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.790\nin memory in the array.\n\n65\n00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.380\nWe're gonna pipe that out to\nan export command, export out CSV.\n\n66\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.742\nSo comma separated,\nuse our path parameter,\n\n67\n00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:46.490\nwe're gonna specify want to drop that\ninto the path where that script runs.\n\n68\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.675\nSo you could modify that and\nhard code a path.\n\n69\n00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:54.910\nPath c:/ whatever, output it to\nyour external protected drive.\n\n70\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.110\nDo whatever you want.\n\n71\n00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.416\nI just ran that and dropped it into\nthe path where ISE was executing so\n\n72\n00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.560\nit's going to be in\nthe C:\\Windows\\System32 directory.\n\n73\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.353\nBut I called the processes64.csv and\n\n74\n00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:08.940\nthen I used a comma separator for\nthe delimiter.\n\n75\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.950\nSo what we do with all of that,\nif you want to take a look,\n\n76\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.310\nI'll show you where we get that.\n\n77\n00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.770\nRight, here, there's the output of that\nfile, I ran the command in PowerShell,\n\n78\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.250\nI'm going to show you how it did that.\n\n79\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.490\nBut it sits right there, you could see\nin \\Windows\\System32, that's the output.\n\n80\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.990\nI'm gonna show you what's\nin there in just a second.\n\n81\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.240\nI just loaded that up into PowerShell ISE.\n\n82\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.520\nIf you haven't used ISE before, the\ngraphical editor that gives the ability\n\n83\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.300\nto debug and to look at code and\ntest and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n84\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.352\nPowerShell generically is just gonna\nhave the same, for the most part,\n\n85\n00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:43.060\nthe same capabilities, we don't have\nthe debug capabilities built right in.\n\n86\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.080\nWe do have auto-tab for tab complete, but\nwe don't have the ability to browse for\n\n87\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.200\nour commands.\n\n88\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.160\nSearch modules on the side there,\nthe way we do on ISE.\n\n89\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.280\nSo you decide how you wanna do that.\n\n90\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.900\nBut I just type this all in,\nas you can see.\n\n91\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.800\nOne long line.\n\n92\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.770\nJust F8 to execute.\n\n93\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.100\nOnce we did that,\ncame over here, loaded that up.\n\n94\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.492\nAnd I just opened that with Wordpad.\n\n95\n00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:07.480\nYou can open it of course with Excel or\nanything that reads comma separated.\n\n96\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.090\nBut in a forensics investigation,\n\n97\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.580\nwe're just going to want to be able\nto take quick look at the data.\n\n98\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.000\nGet a sense of what's there.\n\n99\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.830\nYou'll see all of the lists for\nthe working set, all for\n\n100\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.870\nall of the services that\nwe're currently running.\n\n101\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.690\nOn this Windows 10 machine\nwhen I ran this, and\n\n102\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.830\nthe number out here is going to be the\nvalue in kilobytes of the amount of memory\n\n103\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.980\nthat is being assigned to every process.\n\n104\n00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.479\nSo you'll see we have system at\n32k in kilobytes, by the way.\n\n105\n00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:39.330\nThe scheduler, 3092, so about 3 megs, you\ncan just go on and on all the way down.\n\n106\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.250\nSo we've got all of this here, all of\nit is running, show experience host,\n\n107\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.888\nMicrosoft Edge, Microsoft Photos, it's\ngot a bunch of different stuff running.\n\n108\n00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.330\nBut as it's telling me all the things\nthat are in the system and\n\n109\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.700\nit tells me all the 64 bit processes and\nhow much memory they have.\n\n110\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.570\nSo can I manipulate that script to\na bunch of different stuff to pull\n\n111\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.220\nthe dynamic data, the volatile data\non memory out of the system, but\n\n112\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.780\nto export it to a place\nwhere I can write it safely?\n\n113\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.590\nYeah, with a quick modification of\nthat script, I could easily do that,\n\n114\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.410\njust simply modify the path statement and\npush it out to your right block device\n\n115\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.660\ninstead of local, the way I did to\ndrop it in the working directory.\n\n116\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.550\nAnd you're done,\nyou've got a forensically sound capture\n\n117\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.240\nof the information in memory and\nthe processes.\n\n118\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.810\nSo again, comfort with\nknowledge of the built-in tools\n\n119\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.740\nof the operating system in question allows\nyou to have a lot of flexibility and\n\n120\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.270\na lot of capabilities with regards\nto how you may choose to go in.\n\n121\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.860\nI choose, or may choose to analyze data.\n\n122\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.940\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe Windows Registry,\n\n123\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.070\nthe working set primarily we've looked at\nso far has been in either local machine.\n\n124\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.590\nFor the most case in current control set.\n\n125\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.730\nOccasionally, we may have gone and\ntalked about users, things like that.\n\n126\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.080\nThere are additional register\nkeys that will come up,\n\n127\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.700\nbut there are five root\nfolders in the registry.\n\n128\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.090\nAll five are important to us,\n\n129\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.260\nall five will give us information\nthat could be valuable.\n\n130\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.611\nYou'll see them they are, HKEY_USERS,\nCURRENT_USERS, LOCAL_MACHINE,\n\n131\n00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:04.680\nCURRENT_CONFIG, CLASSES_ROOT give you\na little explanation, a sentence or so\n\n132\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.890\naround each one.\n\n133\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.510\nAny actively loaded user profiles in\nthe system would be found under users.\n\n134\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.490\nObviously, important to\nhave knowledge of that.\n\n135\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.760\nIf we a user\n\n136\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.250\naccount that may be used by somebody\nyou wanna see what's in their profile.\n\n137\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.340\nYou wanna probably go and\ntake a look at the settings in there.\n\n138\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.485\nAutorun, would set the startup,\nwhat kinda shares are created.\n\n139\n00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:27.990\nYour different alternate user profile\nmay have access to different tools and\n\n140\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.340\ndifferent elements of the system\nmay be modified for use and\n\n141\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.435\nwe'd wanna know that as an investigator.\n\n142\n00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:37.755\nCURRENT_USER is the program or the profile\nfor the currently logged on user.\n\n143\n00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:39.560\nLOCAL_MACHINE the config information for\n\n144\n00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.444\nthe system, again the one that we\ntend to look at most frequently.\n\n145\n00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:45.470\nCURRENT_CONFIG hardware profile\nused during startups we\n\n146\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.052\nwanna see what's going on there.\n\n147\n00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:50.349\nAnd CLASSES_ROOT this is where\napplication information is for\n\n148\n00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.139\nthe applications that are used,\nhow they're mapped, what opens what.\n\n149\n00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.290\nHey, Wordpad opens set.csv file,\ndidn't know that.\n\n150\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.650\nWell, we can go take a look actually\nin CLASSES_ROOT, and if we program and\n\n151\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.400\nthen say, yes, use this automatically,\nwe would find evidence of that there.\n\n152\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.330\nThe registry paths, and\nthe file path equivalents, are here.\n\n153\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.835\nI know it's kinda hard to\nsometimes remember where they are.\n\n154\n00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:13.970\nI'll just move this over.\n\n155\n00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.670\nOr let me do this, just one second and\nmove it over like this.\n\n156\n00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.010\nThere we go, so you can see that.\n\n157\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.850\nJust so you can see the edge of it, but\nyou can see our LOCAL_MACHINE Systems,\n\n158\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.390\nSAM, Security, Software,\nand HKEY_USERS Default.\n\n159\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.120\nThese will be the things\nthat we wanna look at and\n\n160\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.300\nmost likely look forward\nin each of these areas.\n\n161\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.230\nSo, in the LOCAL_MACHINE we wanna be in\nSystem and see what's going on in there.\n\n162\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.130\nLOCAL_MACHINE we wanna see the SAM hive.\n\n163\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.140\nThat's gonna be where\nour user accounts are,\n\n164\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.720\nwhere our password hashes are for\ninstance.\n\n165\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.790\nWe've talked about some of those things\nand the importance of getting them.\n\n166\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.160\nThe Security folder, the Software folder.\n\n167\n00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.896\nThe Default for the default user.\n\n168\n00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:51.179\nBut you can see that we\ncan find file paths for\n\n169\n00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.895\nthis information in the OS as well,\ntypically Windows\\System32.\n\n170\n00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:57.519\nAnd then the Config and\nwe'll see information there.\n\n171\n00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.090\nSo knowing that we could go browse and\nfind one or\n\n172\n00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.560\nmore of these areas in the file\nsystem as well as in the registry,\n\n173\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.200\nwould again be valuable for us in Windows.\n\n174\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.790\nRemember, we're trying to play off the\nknowledge and the information we already\n\n175\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.320\npossess about the Windows structure,\nthe operating system structure.\n\n176\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.300\nIn this case, in Windows, and use that\nto our advantage as an investigator.\n\n177\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.790\nWhere will I reach in and\nfind that information.\n\n178\n00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.820\nWhat would I find if I go to\nWindows System 32 Config?\n\n179\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.867\nYou know it's hard to say but\nif we take a look, yeah, just go in here.\n\n180\n00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:35.130\nSo if we go to Windows,\ngo to system 32 which is right there.\n\n181\n00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.670\nAnd we go in and we go to Config.\n\n182\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.590\nRight?\nAnd we do need administrative rights,\n\n183\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.440\nno problem.\n\n184\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.740\nBut we will see that we see all sorts\nof stuff in here, our reg backup,\n\n185\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.630\nour security logs,\nour sam information is here.\n\n186\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.148\nAll the files were talking\nabout are listed here.\n\n187\n00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:55.080\nWould you wanna have access to this,\nwould you want to pull this?\n\n188\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.760\nThere's defaults, there's drivers.\n\n189\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.480\nWould you wanna get a copy of this?\n\n190\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.410\nDo you wanna be looking\nat that information?\n\n191\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.400\nYeah, you probably would, right?\n\n192\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.854\nI mean, it's gonna be a lot of valuable\ninformation that is referenced by\n\n193\n00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:08.885\nthe registry, and vice versa between this\nworking directory and the registry keys.\n\n194\n00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:12.280\nYou've got a map everything going on in\nthe system, you wanna have access to this.\n\n195\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.460\nPulling this through a drive image\nwould obviously give it to you.\n\n196\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.400\nAnd I'm not suggesting you couldn't get\nit, just pointing out you should have to\n\n197\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.070\nknow that you wanna go look for\nit once you do capture.\n\n198\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.060\nRemember, we don't\nselectively image directory,\n\n199\n00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.420\nwe just turn the image\nto the whole system.\n\n200\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.240\nWe would probably get these files.\n\n201\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.890\nBut knowing they're there,\nknowing what they're good for.\n\n202\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.050\nKnowing you can use them\nwould be another story.\n\n203\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.567\nYou may or may not be familiar\nwith the fact that they're there.\n\n204\n00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:34.991\nYou may not be aware of the fact\nthat they exist and have value.\n\n205\n00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.998\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe system is more about targeting and\n\n206\n00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.190\nbeing more focused in your investigation.\n\n207\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.235\n&gt;&gt; It's about knowing that the structure,\n\n208\n00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:43.870\nwhere image data would be\nfound that can be valuable.\n\n209\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.810\nSo you think about, potentially,\na mythical bookcase,\n\n210\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.470\nwith a hundred shelves, right?\n\n211\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.277\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; If we take the drive image and\n\n212\n00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:54.206\npretend that that is what the drive,\noverall,\n\n213\n00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:58.910\nthe composite image would be what shelf\nand what book do we want to read?\n\n214\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.840\nWhat's gonna be of value to us, right?\n\n215\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.960\nAnd we have to selectively go in and\nparse that information.\n\n216\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.511\nAnd if you remember in our extensive\ndiscussions on the hard drive forensics\n\n217\n00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:11.559\nright, the structure of the hard drive,\nthe bits, the bytes, right, the nibbles,\n\n218\n00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.076\nall that stuff we went through.\n\n219\n00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:16.471\nAnd you'll just thinking about the\ngeometry of a drive, thinking about where\n\n220\n00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:20.680\ninformation may be, how it's written, how\nwe access it, is it contiguous, is it not?\n\n221\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.140\nHow do we find it knowing that we have\na drive map, essentially, an MBR, or\n\n222\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.550\nmaster boot record file allocation table.\n\n223\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.572\nAll these kinds of things play\ninto this and we would have to be,\n\n224\n00:10:30.572 --> 00:10:33.498\nI like what you said,\neither selective or focused, right?\n\n225\n00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; About extraneous data,\n\n226\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.980\nkinda getting rid of the stuff that\nmay not make sense in this particular\n\n227\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.050\ndiscussion, really zeroing in\non the information we want.\n\n228\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.715\nAll information has value.\n\n229\n00:10:43.715 --> 00:10:47.375\nThe question is whether the value in that\ninformation is perceived by us as being,\n\n230\n00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:50.090\nin this case,\nimportant in this particular conversation.\n\n231\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.550\nOr perhaps put off to the side and\nreferenced for future conversation.\n\n232\n00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.240\nWhere it's value becomes more apparent and\nreadily available to us.\n\n233\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.090\nSo this question of need in context,\nis often what we talk about.\n\n234\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.700\nHow do we know when\nthe system was shut down?\n\n235\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.870\nWhat's the last time\nthe system was shut down?\n\n236\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.310\nGot a cool little trick I'm gonna\nshow you about this, right?\n\n237\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.637\nWe can go to this registry key right here.\n\n238\n00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:11.260\nYou'll see the stage key local\nmachine system control set 00X.\n\n239\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.180\nX is a placeholder for\nthe working control set.\n\n240\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.960\nTypically, 001,\n002 is what you'll see there.\n\n241\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.420\nSo you wanna go into the working control\nset, whichever one is the most recent one.\n\n242\n00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.980\nControl Windows shutdown time.\n\n243\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.230\nSo we've go to our registry editor.\n\n244\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.210\nYou'll see right here,\nI've gone in to that.\n\n245\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.890\nThis is the path that I'm in right here.\n\n246\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:36.251\nSo you'll see control,\nI'm in hk/localmachine system control and\n\n247\n00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.360\nthen down here, right, I'm in my Windows.\n\n248\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.280\nI've got shut down time right here.\n\n249\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.870\nI have this is on my Windows 10 machine,\nright?\n\n250\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.030\nSo you'll see the reference I show\nyou on the web in a minute is for\n\n251\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.860\nWindows 7 Vista etc.\n\n252\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.800\nIt works up until this day for\nWindows 10 Server 16,\n\n253\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.770\nworks most recent versions of Windows.\n\n254\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.890\nJust because something is old,\nas I've talked about on other shows,\n\n255\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.960\ndoes not mean it's not gonna work.\n\n256\n00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.630\nYou gotta go and\nyou gotta test it, right?.\n\n257\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.050\nYou gotta check, lot of times those\nreferences on those websites.\n\n258\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.670\nI'm gonna show you this with\na wireless SID keys as well.\n\n259\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.020\nLooking for the encrypted SID keys,\n\n260\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.770\nI'm gonna show that even though\nthe information on the little page,\n\n261\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.990\nI'm gonna show you says XB is here.\n\n262\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.790\nAnd then Vista and\nit doesn't say Vista forward.\n\n263\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.639\nIt just says, Vista find it here,\n\n264\n00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.333\nthat path is gonna work even\ntoday in windows center.\n\n265\n00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:23.120\nI'm gonna show you in just two minutes.\n\n266\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.260\nBe skeptical and check those paths.\n\n267\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.030\nA lot of times, these core functions\nburied deep in the registry,\n\n268\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.100\nthey do not change version to version.\n\n269\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.825\nWe had a major seismic shift\nfrom XP to Vista, right?\n\n270\n00:12:34.825 --> 00:12:37.730\nIf you think about the logic\nof the programmatic model.\n\n271\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.070\nBut once we did that, Vista forward,\ncertainly Windows 7 forward.\n\n272\n00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.170\nAll that information is essentially hard\ncoded and almost without exception has not\n\n273\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.710\nchanged in four or five versions\nof the OS at this point, right?\n\n274\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.220\nSo in that respect, a lot of those\nreferences are gonna be rock solid for\n\n275\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.060\nyou no matter what version\nyou're working on.\n\n276\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.860\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n277\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.230\nBut try to give the URLs, bracket both\nsides of that divide, pre and post XP so\n\n278\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.320\nyou have a sense of old versus new.\n\n279\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.690\nBut unless you're playing in that old\nworld on a regular basis, anything that\n\n280\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.750\nsays Vista typically will work for\nWindows 10 Service 16, you name it.\n\n281\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.960\nSo there's a problem with this,\ntake a look at that.\n\n282\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.830\nCan we go full screen for a second please.\n\n283\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.500\nTake a look at this.\n\n284\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.660\nWhat do you see?\n\n285\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.150\nWhat am I pointing to right here?\n\n286\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.915\n&gt;&gt; That looks, I was gonna say a Mac\naddress for a second, and [CROSSTALK]\n\n287\n00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:21.499\n&gt;&gt; No, it looks like it.\n\n288\n00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:23.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little too long.\n\n289\n00:13:23.944 --> 00:13:25.320\n&gt;&gt; But that is not normal human readable\ntext. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that looks like hex.\n\n290\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.300\n&gt;&gt; That is, essentially, exactly, right?\n\n291\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.220\nThat's a reg binary key, which means that\ndata is there, but we can't read it.\n\n292\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.720\nIt's not in a form that makes sense to us.\n\n293\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.630\nYou wanna translate that shutdown time for\nme?\n\n294\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.724\nThat may be a little hard, right?\n\n295\n00:13:36.724 --> 00:13:37.574\n&gt;&gt; It's totally easy.\n\n296\n00:13:37.574 --> 00:13:38.550\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n297\n00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.508\nI'm gonna show you.\n\n298\n00:13:39.508 --> 00:13:42.781\n&gt;&gt; 55 minutes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get out my calculator,\n\n299\n00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:43.748\nstart punching away there.\n\n300\n00:13:43.748 --> 00:13:45.764\nI'm gonna show you a trick to this.\n\n301\n00:13:45.764 --> 00:13:48.130\nIt's actually not as hard as it appears,\ncouple of ways.\n\n302\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.625\nThere's a VB script that we\ncan run that will do this.\n\n303\n00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:52.340\nBut it's a little complex.\n\n304\n00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.100\nBut let me show you.\n\n305\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.735\nI got a cool little Unimog page I wanna\nshow you about off-road that I bookmarked\n\n306\n00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:58.294\nfor you.\n\n307\n00:13:58.294 --> 00:13:59.969\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the other one was,\n\n308\n00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:02.283\nall right, so\nhow do you determine last shut down time,\n\n309\n00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:04.390\nright remember I told you XP/2003/Vista.\n\n310\n00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.180\nThis information works on Windows 10.\n\n311\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.330\nYou're gonna see me do it live, right now.\n\n312\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:08.947\nSo, go down here.\n\n313\n00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:11.680\nYou can obviously read\nup on the event IDs.\n\n314\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.490\nI'm not worried about that.\n\n315\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.170\nYou guys can figure out event IDs for\nstartup and shutdown.\n\n316\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.480\nBut what I want to show you is when you\ngo into the registry, you go look for\n\n317\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.970\nthat key just where I told you.\n\n318\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.760\nNow there is a VB script that you can run,\n\n319\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.050\nthis script right here, that will convert\nthat binary data into readable form.\n\n320\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.980\nBut you know what?\n\n321\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.960\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n322\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.100\nYou could do that.\n\n323\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.950\nI do that all the time, but unless I\nhave that precompiled and I can run it,\n\n324\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.170\na lot of work.\n\n325\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.627\nSo let me tell you what you're gonna\ndo instead because that will work, but\n\n326\n00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.004\nI've got a better trick for you, right.\n\n327\n00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.481\nSo you're going to take this registry key,\nyou're gonna go here,\n\n328\n00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.828\nyou're gonna export this.\n\n329\n00:14:44.828 --> 00:14:48.672\nAnd we're gonna use the magic of\nthe Windows file system to cheat.\n\n330\n00:14:48.672 --> 00:14:49.797\nBut we're not going to call it cheating,\n\n331\n00:14:49.797 --> 00:14:51.027\nwe are gonna call it\nknowledge acquisition.\n\n332\n00:14:51.027 --> 00:14:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Or creative overthinking, [LAUGH].\n\n333\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.140\n&gt;&gt; No, we're just gonna use\nthe file system against itself.\n\n334\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.698\nSo instead of saving this as a reg key,\n\n335\n00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:00.520\nwe're gonna convert\nthat reg key in a text.\n\n336\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.060\nSo we're gonna save it as a text file.\n\n337\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.510\nWhen we save it as a text file,\nwhich I have already done, so\n\n338\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.060\nlet's assume I just did that,\nwhen I save it as a text file then\n\n339\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.320\nall you need to do is go open it up.\n\n340\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.170\nThis is the reg key, right there.\n\n341\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.280\nAnd last write time, right there.\n\n342\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.720\n&gt;&gt; Is already converted.\n\n343\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.320\n&gt;&gt; Is, well, not converted,\nbut last write time.\n\n344\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.010\nIf you know, and this is the trick,\nyou gotta know Windows and\n\n345\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.510\nunderstand the reg keys.\n\n346\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.710\nThe last write time is the time that the\nsystem was shutdown because we write to\n\n347\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.360\nthe reg key to update the system\nshutdown time as we shutdown.\n\n348\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.380\nSo we're not converting the binary\ndirectly, we'll pulling metadata out that\n\n349\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.560\ntells us the same thing,\nby simply converting it to a text file.\n\n350\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.275\nIt does give us the same\nexact information.\n\n351\n00:15:45.275 --> 00:15:47.268\nIf we ram that visual basic script and\n\n352\n00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:50.432\nconverted the binary data we\nwould get that information.\n\n353\n00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:52.174\nSo that was the last\ntime it was shut down.\n\n354\n00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:53.586\n&gt;&gt; So instead of doing the conversion,\n\n355\n00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:55.690\nwe just asked somebody who\nall ready knows the answer.\n\n356\n00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.514\nEssentially.\n\n357\n00:15:56.514 --> 00:16:00.160\nYou call me and I tell you how to find\nthe answer, it's exactly what you do.\n\n358\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.990\nBut we're cheating a little bit,\nbut you know what,\n\n359\n00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.570\nwe still get the same information.\n\n360\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.085\nBecause what we did is simply look at\nthe metadata that tells us what the last\n\n361\n00:16:07.085 --> 00:16:08.620\nwrite time was on the key, and\n\n362\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.800\nas I said, the last write time on\nthat key is the shut down time.\n\n363\n00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.870\nSo without having to convert the binary,\nwe get the same information.\n\n364\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.930\nNow, technically,\nyou're gonna show up in court and\n\n365\n00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.668\nuse that as information\nyou want to present?\n\n366\n00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:23.290\nYou probably wanna run the script\nto convert it just to show\n\n367\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.490\nthat you did it the right way.\n\n368\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.607\nThis is the quick and dirty way.\n\n369\n00:16:25.607 --> 00:16:28.770\n[LAUGH] This is the I need\nto know in the field way.\n\n370\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.430\nThe formal let me do it to show it and\ndocument it way is the VB script.\n\n371\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.860\nBut this will give you the same\ninformation, just so you know.\n\n372\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.860\nSo we could pull that key's information,\nlook at the metadata for write time, and\n\n373\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.380\nboom, got the shutdown time on the system.\n\n374\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.520\nSo that's kinda a neat little trick,\nmay be valuable for you, right?\n\n375\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.022\nLittle parlor trick there for\nyou [LAUGH] in Windows.\n\n376\n00:16:47.022 --> 00:16:49.746\nBut we can go over to the register key,\nget all sorts of funny and\n\n377\n00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:50.708\ncrazy stuff like this.\n\n378\n00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:53.699\nAll right, so you could read up on that,\nand I showed you the URL for that,\n\n379\n00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:55.300\nshowed you where to get that.\n\n380\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.690\nWhat about the wireless SIDs,\nI talked about this one as well.\n\n381\n00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.040\nAgain, when you go out to the web and\n\n382\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.260\nyou go take a look and you go look for it,\nthis URL that I put in the show notes.\n\n383\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.920\nHow do you find the registry files for\nthe stored wireless keys?\n\n384\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.340\nThis'll tell you in Windows XP and\nWindows Vista.\n\n385\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.260\nDifferent locations, great, Windows XP.\n\n386\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.450\nIf you need to know where they are,\ngo there, they'll be there.\n\n387\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.250\nWindows Vista, where do you go?\n\n388\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.385\nTells you where to go right there.\n\n389\n00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:24.940\nC, program data, Microsoft, you know,\nWAN service, da-da-da-da-da.\n\n390\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.310\nAnd that path is still good in Windows 10,\nand I'm gonna show it you right now.\n\n391\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.500\nThat path is right here, so\nprogram data, Microsoft, right,\n\n392\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.740\nwlan service profiles, interfaces,\nand then inside here in interfaces,\n\n393\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.910\nyou have essentially\nwhat looks like a GUID.\n\n394\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.570\nYou open this up.\n\n395\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.410\nYou've got xml files.\n\n396\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.110\nEach one of these is a wireless profile\nthat has been saved to the system along\n\n397\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:54.630\nwith the SSID and if it's WPA2,\nEnterprise, whatever the encrypted keys.\n\n398\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.040\nI'm gonna show you what they look like.\n\n399\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.140\nWe can open these files up and\nactually strip all the wireless info and\n\n400\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.630\ngo ahead and hack,\nif we need to, to find the keys.\n\n401\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.750\nBut we can also look at\nthe wireless connectivity and\n\n402\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.110\nsee what profiles have been\non file in the system.\n\n403\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.490\nEvery one of them has a unique identifier,\nso let me show you what I mean here.\n\n404\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.390\nLet's take this one, just open this up.\n\n405\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.870\nYou can open it with anything you want,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n406\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.030\nOkay, well just ask me later.\n\n407\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:27.005\nAnd, You'll see in here this is\none of the two wireless profiles.\n\n408\n00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:31.770\nITPROTV-Guest, there's the hex\nequivalent for the SSID, right?\n\n409\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.620\nThere's the information\nconnection mode manual.\n\n410\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.930\nThere's the authentication WPA2 AES,\nright?\n\n411\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.280\nThere is my pass phrase, key type true.\n\n412\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.380\nThere's my key right there, all right?\n\n413\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.810\nSo I'm not suggesting that that means\nyou can go crack the wireless key.\n\n414\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.540\nI don't care about the wireless key,\n\n415\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.230\nI care about the wireless profiles\non the system as an investigator.\n\n416\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.780\nI wanna see who's connecting,\nI wanna see what they're doing and\n\n417\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.615\nhow they're connecting.\n\n418\n00:18:53.615 --> 00:18:55.460\nSo, I want this information.\n\n419\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.700\nMaybe I wanna use that key.\n\n420\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.590\nMaybe as a hacker, I wanna take that\nkey and I wanna do something with it.\n\n421\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.220\nWell, I may or\n\n422\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.930\nmay not be able to but my point is,\nat least I know where to find it.\n\n423\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.930\nWhen I walk through these profiles\nI can see all that information.\n\n424\n00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.440\nSo again, your knowledge of the file\nsystem, knowledge of where to find this\n\n425\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.030\nstuff in Windows and we're trying to\ngive you that information as we go here.\n\n426\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.420\nWhere are your wireless SIDS, you could\nsee how to find them right there, right?\n\n427\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.340\nSo, we would pull all this\ninformation off the hard drive\n\n428\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.990\nby getting that forensic image.\n\n429\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.528\nNow we have to start to go fishing.\n\n430\n00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:29.130\nWe are carving and just slicing up those\nfile access points and looking for\n\n431\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.060\nthis information, pulling it out\nof the file system as we go.\n\n432\n00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.810\nContinuing to find this information.\n\n433\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.690\nWhere do we find all sorts of\nadditional stuff in the registry?\n\n434\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.410\nWell, you could see here got\nthe lan man server shares.\n\n435\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.860\nI've shown you that key already.\n\n436\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.320\nWhere are all the USB devices that\nwould have been mounted right here?\n\n437\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.180\nWe're all mounted devices.\n\n438\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.310\nThe user assist key is\nanother interesting one.\n\n439\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:54.550\nIf we go into the user assist key there's\na bunch of GUIDs that tell us what objects\n\n440\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.280\nare used, like shortcuts,\ncontrol panel applet programs, etc.\n\n441\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.910\nI could actually decode all of that.\n\n442\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.650\nThe reason I have the decode website\nthere, all that information in\n\n443\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.430\nthe GUIDs is stored in ROT-13,\nwhich is the substitution cipher.\n\n444\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.780\nYou pull the information out, dump it\non that page, the decode.org page and\n\n445\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.870\nit'll actually give you the information\nto decode it and tell you what it is.\n\n446\n00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.730\nSo when you do this, you're able to then\nessentially find the information and\n\n447\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.050\ndecode what's there.\n\n448\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.900\nSo, let's just take a quick look,\nshall we?\n\n449\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.330\nLet's go in user sys key.\n\n450\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.150\nWe gotta go into current users so,\nactually Daniel,\n\n451\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.600\nyou've got this in the notes,\nyou can tell me the path, right?\n\n452\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.770\nPull that up there.\n\n453\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:30.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n454\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.590\nso can you read the path to me\nwhen I pull up the reg editor, so\n\n455\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.840\nI don't have to keep going back and\nforth, would that be okay?\n\n456\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.210\n&gt;&gt; Trying to think where you're at.\n\n457\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry,\nthat was in the user sys keys right below.\n\n458\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Got it?\n\n459\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.030\nOkay.\nIf you could just tell me that whole path.\n\n460\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.810\n&gt;&gt; The whole path for?\n\n461\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.930\n&gt;&gt; Give me one second.\n\n462\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.200\n&gt;&gt; For the user sys key,\ncurrent user Microsoft, etc.\n\n463\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.763\nAnd that way I can pull it up,\njust give me one second.\n\n464\n00:20:49.763 --> 00:20:50.507\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n465\n00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:55.820\n&gt;&gt; So, local machine, current user.\n\n466\n00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.650\n&gt;&gt; And you're in software.\n\n467\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.460\n&gt;&gt; Doo da doo da doo.\n\n468\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.260\n&gt;&gt; Current user.\n\n469\n00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.220\nOne second here.\n\n470\n00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.850\nThere we are software, okay.\n\n471\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Then it's in Microsoft, then Windows.\n\n472\n00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.275\n&gt;&gt; All the way down, just one second.\n\n473\n00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:11.840\nWindows.\n\n474\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.830\nStill one of the only things I\ndon't like about Windows 10,\n\n475\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.870\nyou can't open multiple\nversions of the reg editor.\n\n476\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.130\nYou gotta open another one,\nit keeps you in the same one.\n\n477\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.470\nSo, if I wanna pre load all the keys for\nthe demos, I got It can only do one so\n\n478\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.390\nthat's the whole reason I've\ngot to load this one live.\n\n479\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.410\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Windows, go ahead.\n\n480\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.520\n&gt;&gt; You're in current version.\n\n481\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.820\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Then Explorer.\n\n482\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Do do do.\n\n483\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Then user assist.\n\n484\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go all the way to right there.\n\n485\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.290\nAll right, so\nyou can see all of these keys right here.\n\n486\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.280\nThese are the ones that have\nthe GUIDs that I was talking about.\n\n487\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.320\nSo, you can open this up and\n\n488\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.510\nyou would have to take this information,\njust take a look and you could take.\n\n489\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.240\nYou could see here we got a bunch of what\nseems like just kind of crazy information,\n\n490\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.190\ndoesn't really seem like it makes any\nsense or really tells us anything, but\n\n491\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.780\nwhat we're actually able to do\nis translate this information.\n\n492\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.160\nSo let's go in, let's do the following.\n\n493\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.970\nJust have to pull up the, one second,\n\n494\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.072\npull up the site that I bookmarked for\nyou with user assist.\n\n495\n00:22:11.072 --> 00:22:15.890\nSo, a little bit of information on\nthe user assist key, gives us information,\n\n496\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.660\nkind of tells us that\nthe key contains information.\n\n497\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.900\nTells us where to find it,\nas I showed you.\n\n498\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.400\nAnd then we need to go\ninto the decode.org.\n\n499\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.808\nSo we just pull up the decode.org site.\n\n500\n00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:33.470\nAnd, decode.org, there we go, right there.\n\n501\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.970\nOkay.\n\n502\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.610\nYou can do any,\nthere's a whole bunch of these online.\n\n503\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.630\nThis just happens to be one that\neverybody uses because it's out there,\n\n504\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.840\nit's easy to find.\n\n505\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.230\nNow you'll see the ROT-13 site.\n\n506\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.010\nYou can literally just dump\nthe information in here, right?\n\n507\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.270\nSo you can go ahead and put in\nthe information that you wanted to code.\n\n508\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.440\nSo let's go grab something.\n\n509\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.700\nLet me find my reg editor.\n\n510\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.360\nThere we are.\n\n511\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.890\nSo we can go ahead and\nwe can take this information.\n\n512\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:08.210\nLet's just take Wait, hold on,\nthat's not what we want.\n\n513\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.650\nGot all sorts of crazy stuff there.\n\n514\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.790\nOkay, hold on.\n\n515\n00:23:17.178 --> 00:23:20.064\nWe've got no end key, of course.\n\n516\n00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:21.079\nAll right, so.\n\n517\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.310\nOops, dropped my stuff there.\n\n518\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.884\nSo, you'll see if we decrypt the actual\nGUID itself, or what looks like the GUID,\n\n519\n00:23:32.884 --> 00:23:36.016\nwe're not getting anything that seems\nto be all that valuable, right?\n\n520\n00:23:36.016 --> 00:23:38.700\nWhat you're getting there is\nessentially just a string of letters.\n\n521\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:45.131\nWhat we want, let's go in and\nlet's grab this one here.\n\n522\n00:23:45.131 --> 00:23:52.657\nSo let's grab This information.\n\n523\n00:23:52.657 --> 00:23:55.303\nHere, the value name, it's hard to see.\n\n524\n00:23:55.303 --> 00:23:57.230\nLets move this over, so you can see.\n\n525\n00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.320\nSee right here,\nthis string right here, right?\n\n526\n00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.900\nThat's what we are gonna go after.\n\n527\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.035\nSo lets go grab this.\n\n528\n00:24:02.035 --> 00:24:03.890\nLet's get rid of that.\n\n529\n00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.280\nLet me just paste that in there,\nlike that.\n\n530\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.400\nAnd you can see there,\nUEME client CLT session.\n\n531\n00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.990\nI'm not sure what that is.\n\n532\n00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.210\nIt's some sort of an application or\na program, something in Windows.\n\n533\n00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.010\nBut, whatever that is,\n\n534\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.980\nthat's what's actually referenced\nin this reg key right here.\n\n535\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.760\nThere's a reg binary value for setting the\ndata or for setting a parameter around it.\n\n536\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.150\nBut in this particular unique instance,\nwhatever that GUID ID points to for\n\n537\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.670\nthis particular piece of software,\nprogram,\n\n538\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:39.660\nwhatever was loaded under this particular\nkey for this user, UEME client session.\n\n539\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.320\nThis is what actually equals\nUEME underscore client,\n\n540\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.890\nthe underscore you can see in the middle,\nclient session.\n\n541\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.070\nThat's one piece of software used by\nthis user when they load their profile.\n\n542\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.850\nAnd we can literally just\nwalk through this list,\n\n543\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.500\none at a time, just move down here,\nso we can see.\n\n544\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.430\nAnd we can go in, we can get this and\n\n545\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.790\njust kind of walk down each one, and\nthat is PG, looks like it is VBA,\n\n546\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.680\nlooks like it may be the same,\nit's usually, that's the same one.\n\n547\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.510\nWe may have to look at a few\ndifferent ones here to see.\n\n548\n00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.220\nThis one doesn't have anything not\nall of them will have something.\n\n549\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.910\nSo you can see looks like all of these\nare going to point to the same thing so\n\n550\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.480\nthey may or may not be unique but\nyou know this is the unsexy,\n\n551\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.340\nuncool part about forensics that\nwe talk about we're going through.\n\n552\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.260\nLook at go, you just got to go\nthrough till you find different ones.\n\n553\n00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.042\nBut you can see, as I kinda scroll over,\nrunning out of room with my mouse here.\n\n554\n00:25:35.042 --> 00:25:37.880\n[LAUGH] As I scroll over,\nlet me extend this out, you could see.\n\n555\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.050\nThere's a bunch of stuff in here, right?\n\n556\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.280\nAnd we could begin to decrypt these, and\n\n557\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.010\nactually find out what all\nthese different items are.\n\n558\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.650\nAnd literally every one of these would\nreference some piece of software and\n\n559\n00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.800\napplication to service something\nthat we'd wanna know about.\n\n560\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.890\nOne of the ways Malware hides, and we get\nroute kids among other things, is that it\n\n561\n00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:01.370\nwill load itself, as you know, into their\nsystem, burrow deep and may or may not\n\n562\n00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.500\nleave traces in the gooey, but it's gonna\nleave a record somewhere in the registry.\n\n563\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.710\nWe tend to find that stuff\nin the user's sys keys.\n\n564\n00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.890\nThat's one of the ways we parse and\nlook for this.\n\n565\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.410\nSo, decrypting these keys may actually\nprove to be very valuable for\n\n566\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.050\nus and can give us an interesting\namount of information.\n\n567\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.130\nAnd if you dig through all the keys,\n\n568\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.910\nyou'll find there's quite a bit of data\nthere that we may be able to cull.\n\n569\n00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.260\nAgain, when we get all this,\nin a forensics grab, a clean DD image or\n\n570\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.890\na clean image of some kind of a hard\ndrive, we would have all of this.\n\n571\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.830\nSo all we'd have to do is go back\nforensically, look for it, and\n\n572\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.140\nmake sure that we knew\nthat it was there and\n\n573\n00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.140\nobviously parse the registry\nto get all this information.\n\n574\n00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.350\nBut we can pull all these keys out,\ntranslate them one at a time, and\n\n575\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.640\nbegin to complete, or rather,\ncompile a complete list of what software.\n\n576\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.590\nShould have been available,\nwhich should have been running.\n\n577\n00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.940\nCross reference that with\nour notes on the image.\n\n578\n00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.570\nIt's interesting,\n\n579\n00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.320\nI don't see these five programs\neven though they say they're there.\n\n580\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.150\nMaybe that's the stuff that we wanna\nspend time focusing on, right?\n\n581\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.050\nCuz chances are good that's the stuff\nthat caused the problem and\n\n582\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.690\nthis is how we will break down,\nliterally every piece of the puzzle.\n\n583\n00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.400\nLook at everything and see what's there.\n\n584\n00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.460\nSo this is one of the secret tools\nthat we use behind the scenes\n\n585\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.360\nto be able to read what's\ngoing on in a Windows system.\n\n586\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.975\n&gt;&gt; I had no idea this was even\na thing inside my computer.\n\n587\n00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:12.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's basic, it's an online.\n\n588\n00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.150\nLook, as seen on Mr.\nRobot just like as Seen On TV.\n\n589\n00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.420\nSo as seen on Mr. Robot.\n\n590\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.200\nI don't watch the show.\n\n591\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.050\nWe talked about this before.\n\n592\n00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.140\nBut I heard from a lot of\npeople it's a pretty cool show.\n\n593\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.020\n&gt;&gt; It's very entertaining.\n\n594\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.750\n&gt;&gt; I know for\na fact this particular trick and\n\n595\n00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.790\nthis site was used, on one of the shows.\n\n596\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.550\nI didn't see it but I have heard that this\nparticular little thing was discussed.\n\n597\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.020\nBut all this is, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n598\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI've actually written my own route\n\n599\n00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.510\n13 decryptor.\n\n600\n00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.210\n&gt;&gt; A little decryptor.\n\n601\n00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.650\n&gt;&gt; It's an easy thing to do.\n\n602\n00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:39.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not difficult.\n\n603\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.330\nYou guys can do that inside of PowerShell\nor something and make that happen but Why,\n\n604\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.770\nwhen you have decode.org?\n\n605\n00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the thing, yeah.\n\n606\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which is, why would you bother go\n\n607\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.980\ndoing it if you actually have\na website that does it for you?\n\n608\n00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n609\n00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.760\n&gt;&gt; But the value of doing it yourself,\nobviously, understanding that knowledge,\n\n610\n00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.640\ngetting it is great but,\nit's a simple substitution cipher,\n\n611\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.620\nit's one of the simplest ones we\ntalk about when we do cryptography.\n\n612\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.120\nIt's not used traditionally for much,\n\n613\n00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.400\nbecause we're not worried about\nreally securing that data.\n\n614\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.010\nIt's a very easy cryptographic\nsolution to break as you can see.\n\n615\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.040\nAnd we're not encrypting the data in\nthe registry keys because we want to keep\n\n616\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.780\nit a secret.\n\n617\n00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.100\nWe just don't want it to be readily\napparent inside the registry.\n\n618\n00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.980\nSo, we may go through a few extra steps,\nbut\n\n619\n00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.260\nyou can see that we can easily turn that\ndata into something that's valuable to us.\n\n620\n00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.950\nNot hard to do.\n\n621\n00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.040\nAll right, so MRU, most recently used.\n\n622\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.850\nRun MRU, what was run recently.\n\n623\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.410\nThings like, user clicks the start button,\nchooses run, types in the command,\n\n624\n00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.600\nwe'll get a buffer read on all\nthe files that were called there, so\n\n625\n00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.630\nwe can look at that key to find that.\n\n626\n00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.960\nTyped URL, same kind of thing, this\nmaintains the URLs in the address bar.\n\n627\n00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.380\nYou want to go pull up\na list of all the addresses.\n\n628\n00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.850\nEssentially reading the IE Cache or\nequivalent by browser.\n\n629\n00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.760\nThis is obviously Windows, but we would\nbe able to do this for all the browsers.\n\n630\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.530\nWe can pull up all the URLs\nthat have been typed in and\n\n631\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.790\nwe can see what they are by going and\npulling this gate, type URLs.\n\n632\n00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.530\nSo all these keys are gonna be helpful for\nyou to find information.\n\n633\n00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.440\nAnother key that holds this information.\n\n634\n00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.290\nYou can see it's a little bit longer here.\n\n635\n00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.040\nCurrent user software,\nMicrosoft Windows, current version.\n\n636\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.310\nExplorer, Com Dog 32, open saved Pid IMRU.\n\n637\n00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.550\nThis is the MRU list by the opened save\nas dialogues, within the windows shell.\n\n638\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.140\nYou type in a path,\nto execute something in the shell,\n\n639\n00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.770\nwe'll have a record of that right here.\n\n640\n00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.060\nAnd yet another key that holds\nthat information as well.\n\n641\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.710\nFile EXDS for the file extensions.\n\n642\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.240\nThis will be all the sub keys that show us\nall the extensions that have been opened.\n\n643\n00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.105\nHey, why did somebody open VDS, why did\nsomebody open .psm, PowerShell Module or\n\n644\n00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:36.010\n.PS1 for PowerShell Script whatever.\n\n645\n00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.370\nWe’ll be able to go take a look.\n\n646\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.360\nSo anything you do, keep in mind not\nmatter what it is that’s on that system\n\n647\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.450\nI can reach in there and\nfind a record of what you did.\n\n648\n00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.000\nYou may not want me to know.\n\n649\n00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.620\nYou may not want to tell me, but and\nI may not be an average user, right?\n\n650\n00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.900\nThe average user may not know,\nbut I know and you know.\n\n651\n00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.360\n&gt;&gt; Big brother is watching.\n\n652\n00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.260\n&gt;&gt; Big brother is watching.\n\n653\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:53.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm watching.\n\n654\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n655\n00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:56.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now you know, right?\n\n656\n00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.580\nBecause we've told you how to do all this.\n\n657\n00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.280\nYou can go in, you can look through\nthe notes, all the reg keys are there.\n\n658\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.520\nShowed you, walked you through the logic\nof how to use the assist keys,\n\n659\n00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.030\nuser assist keys to decode that.\n\n660\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.740\nYou could build a complete accurate\nrecord of every piece of software.\n\n661\n00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.270\nEvery extension, every file, accessed\nover a period of time on this box,\n\n662\n00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.960\njust by looking through these registry\nkeys and understanding what's there.\n\n663\n00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.520\nRemember, the registry is the operating\nmanual for the Windows operating system,\n\n664\n00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.120\nit is what does the configuration,\nit is what tells us how to execute,\n\n665\n00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.530\nnothing happens in Windows,\n\n666\n00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.840\nI don't care what you do, nothing happens\nif it's not written down in the registry.\n\n667\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.150\nOr it is configurable and\nadded or removed or\n\n668\n00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.440\nmodified as part of that running process.\n\n669\n00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.650\nIf it's not there, it doesn't exist.\n\n670\n00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.370\nIf you know how to read the registry,\nyou have the owner's manual and\n\n671\n00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.940\neverything that ever happened on that box,\never will happen, and\n\n672\n00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.880\never is possible to have happened.\n\n673\n00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.660\nAnd all you have to do is just read\nthe appropriate information and decode it.\n\n674\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.770\nBut this is how specifically,\non the Windows side,\n\n675\n00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.870\nwe engage in operating system forensics\nfrom the Windows perspective.\n\n676\n00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.570\n&gt;&gt; Lot of cool stuff.\n\n677\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] a lot of great stuff.\n\n678\n00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.119\nWe are gonna allow you good folks out\nthere to ruminate on that interesting\n\n679\n00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:06.610\ninformation we just [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I was gonna think marinate.\n\n680\n00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I like ruminate.\n\n681\n00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.970\n&gt;&gt; Marinate in their own knowledge juices,\nor ruminate, they can think about it.\n\n682\n00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:11.770\n&gt;&gt; You guys are gonna love it.\n\n683\n00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.060\nBut we're out of time for this episode.\n\n684\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.850\nCome back though, we have more to cover.\n\n685\n00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.540\nLike he says it's a large domain,\n\n686\n00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.070\nit's gonna take us quite a few parts\nto get through all that information.\n\n687\n00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.110\nBut that's for this episode it is time for\nus to sign off and\n\n688\n00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.360\nto thank you for watching.\n\n689\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.070\nBut for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n690\n00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.220\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n691\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.915\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n692\n00:31:31.631

00:00:12.022\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:13.704\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:17.165\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.825\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode it is more in our CHFI v9 series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:26.309\nJoining us back in the studio, yet again,\nto lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n8\n00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:27.824\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:29.137\nAdam, glad to have you again, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:31.065\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Good, going well.\n\n11\n00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:35.949\nContinuing our conversations with regards\nto forensics Windows operating system,\n\n12\n00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.196\nforensics, all that stuff that we do.\n\n13\n00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:40.930\nHad a pretty cool episode\nthe last one we just did.\n\n14\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.490\nDelved into the mysteries of\nthe registry a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.120\nShowed you some of those dark, hidden\ncorners about things that you may or\n\n16\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.010\nmay not be aware of.\n\n17\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.904\nTaught Daniel something new.\n\n18\n00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:48.551\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:49.648\n&gt;&gt; He, by his own admission,\n\n20\n00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.050\nwasn't aware of the fact we\ncould use the user assist keys.\n\n21\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.090\nKind of debunk what was going on in there\nwith all the apps that may be running.\n\n22\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.150\nSo some cool stuff.\n\n23\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.020\nYou haven't seen that one,\ndefinitely want to go back, take a look.\n\n24\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.766\nOf all the ones in this series\naround operating system forensics,\n\n25\n00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.030\nthat may be the episode\nthat's probably the most fun.\n\n26\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.491\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the most illuminating just\nin terms of the stuff you may not be\n\n28\n00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.110\naware of, but\nthe stuff that goes on inside Windows.\n\n29\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.220\nSee if we can top that with this one here.\n\n30\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390\nWe're going to talk about some of\nthe cache areas for different browsers,\n\n31\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.790\nplaces you can find stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.020\nBeen focusing in just on Windows,\nIE, Edge, etc.\n\n33\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.620\nWe'll throw Firefox in the mix,\n\n34\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.660\nsome of the others just to tell you\nwhere to find stuff as we get going.\n\n35\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.923\nWanted to start off by talking about\na forensics tool that a lot of us\n\n36\n00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:30.903\nin the industry may have knowledge of,\nmagnet forensics, the Magnet IEF tool.\n\n37\n00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:34.210\nIf you want to join me here just take\na look at the website real quick.\n\n38\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.040\nThis is a forensics tool.\n\n39\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.010\nTool set, I should say,\nthat is used to analyze or\n\n40\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.170\nreport on digital evidence from\na variety of different sources,\n\n41\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.630\nagain, things like computers, smart\nphones, tablets, etc., as you can see.\n\n42\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.140\nSo this is just another one of those\ntools that you may wanna take a look at.\n\n43\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.419\nNotice they do give you a free trial of\nthe full suite of examinations tools.\n\n44\n00:01:55.419 --> 00:02:00.267\nImage acquisition, processing, and\nthen analysis, you know, deep web kind of\n\n45\n00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.900\nstuff, you can pull data out,\nvisualize it, all sorts of great stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.510\nSo this is one those tool sets that may be\nvaluable for you, have the URL there for\n\n47\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.510\nyou in the show notes,\njust thought I'd mention it.\n\n48\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.779\nWe've talked about AutoRuns and\ntaken a look at\n\n49\n00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.400\nwhat kind of stuff may be running and\nhow to find stuff that's running,\n\n50\n00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.750\nboth stuff that is running normally,\nfully exposed in the GUI.\n\n51\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.974\nTask Manager would certainly show you this\nin Windows, the equivalent of list, proc,\n\n52\n00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:25.555\ntop, etc.\n\n53\n00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:28.641\nNone of the other operating systems\nwould show you that kind of stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.560\nPlist, process list,\nis a command line tool.\n\n55\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.920\nIn Windows would do this as well.\n\n56\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.216\nBut there's stuff that is stealth that\nwill not show up in some of those lists.\n\n57\n00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:40.669\nAnd a tool like Auto Runs from Internal\nTool Set may be able to expose that\n\n58\n00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.205\nfor you.\n\n59\n00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.430\nI have a little document,\nlet me just open this one up.\n\n60\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.860\nI don't believe I have\nthis one opened already.\n\n61\n00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.477\nNo I do not, give me one second.\n\n62\n00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:52.279\nA tool that gives some of the start\nup locations the register keys,\n\n63\n00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.298\nlet me just make this a little bit bigger.\n\n64\n00:02:55.298 --> 00:03:00.927\nI'm going to try to put these up at 150%\njust to make them a little bit easier for\n\n65\n00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:02.120\nyou to see.\n\n66\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.780\nWe can go full screen\nsitting over half of that.\n\n67\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.093\nThese documents, this one and\nthe other one I'm going to show you.\n\n68\n00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:09.168\nThey're part of the show notes we'l\nmake sure you have copies of them,\n\n69\n00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:12.060\nyou can obviously download them,\nIf you want to take a look.\n\n70\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.759\nBut determining startup location so\nthe register keys that are associated\n\n71\n00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.997\nwith common things like, what is running,\nwhat will be executed at system start up.\n\n72\n00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:24.138\nWhat values are we going to find and\nthen deleted after one use, so\n\n73\n00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:27.540\nrun once, right,\ncurrent version when log on.\n\n74\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.750\nYou can see all the different keys\nhere along with a little explanation,\n\n75\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.820\nof what they are.\n\n76\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.000\nCurrent control set services.\n\n77\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.040\nCurrent user software.\n\n78\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.920\nIt kind of runs down there as you can see.\n\n79\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.060\nGot them all listed out here for you.\n\n80\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.910\nSo that way you can tell what they are,\nwhere to look for them.\n\n81\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.320\nPut a bunch of these in the notes,\nseparately broke them out.\n\n82\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.750\nPut them into a nice Word document for\nyou.\n\n83\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.930\nGive you a nice little two-page.\n\n84\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.640\nIn this case, table reg key on the left,\na little note explanation on the right.\n\n85\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.550\nValuable perhaps for studying purposes,\nalways good for that.\n\n86\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.680\nCan never go wrong if you know this\nstuff when it comes to an exam.\n\n87\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.530\nIn terms of the real world, good little\ntwo sided laminated cheat sheet for\n\n88\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.830\nwhen you're looking at Windows Systems,\nlooking for those reg keys right?\n\n89\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.010\nKeep that stuff handy.\n\n90\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.992\nYou never know when it may be\nnecessary for you, or useful for you,\n\n91\n00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:14.067\nto have access to that.\n\n92\n00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.920\nSo it may prove to be valuable for\na couple of different reasons.\n\n93\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.680\nThis will help you understand all of\nthe different things that are running, or\n\n94\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.710\npotentially are lurking to run,\nin a system.\n\n95\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.391\nAgain, limited to Windows,\nwanna be clear, right?\n\n96\n00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.420\nShould have put startup Windows or startup\nfor Windows specifically in the title.\n\n97\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.902\nBut It is specific to Windows,\ncuz that's where we see the registry keys.\n\n98\n00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:34.731\nAnd you can tell that just by looking and\n\n99\n00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.020\nseeing everything that's\nMicrosoft centric.\n\n100\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.010\nBut this is gonna be for Windows.\n\n101\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.710\nAs I told you, not necessarily\nspecific to one version, right.\n\n102\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.580\nMost of these keys, multiple\ngenerations backwards or forwards.\n\n103\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.020\nOn the timeline from let's say about\nWindows Vista forward as I said.\n\n104\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.830\nThere's a seismic break in\nthe architecture of Windows between XP and\n\n105\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.110\nVista, but going Vista forward you're\nlooking at an object model that hasn't\n\n106\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.640\nreally changed all that much\nin several generations.\n\n107\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.851\nReg keys, things like that tend to stay\nthe same going forward from Vista.\n\n108\n00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:06.229\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n109\n00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.412\n&gt;&gt; A schism, if you will.\n\n110\n00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:09.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A schism.\n\n111\n00:05:09.924 --> 00:05:10.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a great way\n\n112\n00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:11.356\nof thinking about it.\n\n113\n00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:14.563\nWe'll take a look at the Mac log\nfile list here in a couple minutes,\n\n114\n00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:17.300\ncouple of the other files that I have for\nyou as well.\n\n115\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.860\nIt's got some good information\non some of the other OS's.\n\n116\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.280\nHashes, cookie, and history analysis,\nI showed you this stuff in IE,\n\n117\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.190\nwhere do we see it in Firefox?\n\n118\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.950\nI see Chrome's lurking down there.\n\n119\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.533\nWe'll get to that in just a minute.\n\n120\n00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.863\nSo when you wanna go in grab\nthe cache location, cookie location,\n\n121\n00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:33.160\nhistory location.\n\n122\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.590\nIn Firefox, you got the pass right there.\n\n123\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.220\nAll of these are single\nline entries that's\n\n124\n00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.720\njust been truncated because\nthe way we type the notes in.\n\n125\n00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.340\nSo you would take slash, cache put it\nat the end of default right there for\n\n126\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.350\nthe full path.\n\n127\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.170\nThat's were you would be looking but\nyou will see cache, cookies and\n\n128\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.420\nhistory locations for Firefox.\n\n129\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.680\nSee the same there for Chrome right there.\n\n130\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.487\nWhere do we see history and\ncookie location?\n\n131\n00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:57.130\nWhere do we see cache location?\n\n132\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.112\nAgain, you now, depending on the version\nof Firefox, the version of Chrome,\n\n133\n00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:03.084\nyou may see a slight variation in path.\n\n134\n00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:06.090\nBut this has held constant now for\nseveral generations.\n\n135\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.340\nShould not really see much\nof any variance there.\n\n136\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.990\nThat should pretty much be spot on for\nany of those systems that you're using.\n\n137\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.930\nAnd remember, although we often talk about\nthe fact and I've talked about the fact\n\n138\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.010\nthat the preponderance of\nsystems you may be working with,\n\n139\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.690\nmay be Windows centric multiple\nbrowsers are often used in Windows.\n\n140\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.570\nI have three or four running on my system\nat any one time and I use them for\n\n141\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.310\na variety of different reasons.\n\n142\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.300\nLot of times cuz IE just doesn't\ndisplay websites properly,\n\n143\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.020\nso have to use an alternate\nbrowser to do that.\n\n144\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.784\nBut you know there are many reasons why\nyou would see more than one browser as\n\n145\n00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:40.248\na forensic examiner, must have\nknowledge of these other browsers,\n\n146\n00:06:40.248 --> 00:06:42.659\nespecially Chrome,\nvery popular these days.\n\n147\n00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.090\nFirefox no less so, but you're going to\nsee one or more browsers in most systems.\n\n148\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.480\nAnd you should be prepared\nto deal with that.\n\n149\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n150\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.050\nWith ie, you can see here our path,\n\n151\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.692\ntalk about this in Edge of giving\nyou these information items already.\n\n152\n00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:00.370\nTaken you in and shown you how to pull\nthe files right out of the Edge cache.\n\n153\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.340\nAnd take a look I pulled up JPEGs for you.\n\n154\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.520\nIn one of our last episodes from the cache\ndirectly live on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n155\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.590\nShowed you how to find them,\nso all that stuff is there.\n\n156\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.380\nYou've all the password, all you\nneed to do is go in and take a look.\n\n157\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.916\nCouple of websites that may be\nhelpful with some utilities.\n\n158\n00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:18.720\nThe nirsoft.net utilities, i.e cookies and\n\n159\n00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.620\nbrowsing history view, great tools, don’t\nwork on every version of every browser.\n\n160\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.230\nYou have to mix and match a little bit.\n\n161\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.760\nBut you will find that they are very\nvaluable and very flexible.\n\n162\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.800\nMight be worth your time to take a look,\nI'm not going to bring up those websites\n\n163\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.780\njust referencing them in notes but\nyou could certainly go take a look.\n\n164\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.024\nWe've talked about recycle bin and\ndeletion of information.\n\n165\n00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:40.150\nWe talked about the hard\ndrive discussions we've had.\n\n166\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.720\nIt's a recurring theme,\nstuff doesn't really get deleted,\n\n167\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.050\nit's simply removed from the view and\nthe mindset of the user.\n\n168\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.280\nIt is often still there.\n\n169\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.990\nWe can go in and recover that information.\n\n170\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.007\nGot a couple of URL's on some\nsites that help you to do that.\n\n171\n00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:55.539\nMcAfee has a tool called Refuity,\n\n172\n00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:59.565\nit's a good tool that is used for\nthis kind of process.\n\n173\n00:07:59.565 --> 00:08:03.061\nThey actually acquired it when,\nI think when they bought Foundstone and\n\n174\n00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:06.740\nsome of the other tool sets that were\nout there over the last number of years.\n\n175\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.810\nMcAfee's acquired a lot\nof those older tools, and\n\n176\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.340\nthey got this tool as one\nof those acquisitions.\n\n177\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.340\nStill available, so\nyou should go out and take a look.\n\n178\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.317\nBut the InfoSec Institute item\non recycle bin forensics,\n\n179\n00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:18.966\nactually pretty interesting.\n\n180\n00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:22.185\nJust go load that one up real quick if you\nwant to just read up a little bit on it.\n\n181\n00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:24.642\nWe'll just take a quick quick\nlittle peek at that one.\n\n182\n00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:26.427\nLet me just load that in here for\nyou real quickly.\n\n183\n00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:35.119\nAnd its got a nice little information\nitem, talks about recycle bin, how to\n\n184\n00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:39.915\ndeal with some of the stuff that's there,\ngives you the location of the files.\n\n185\n00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Tries to get you to\ngo to their boot camp.\n\n186\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.420\n&gt;&gt; Tries to get you to sell,\ntries to sell you something, so\n\n187\n00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.490\nobviously just be wary, right.\n\n188\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.080\nBut you can see now it's got a bunch of\nstuff, but it does have some real good\n\n189\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.010\ninformation as you could see about\ndealing with the Windows recycle bin.\n\n190\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.030\nA little bit dated, some of\nthe information's a little bit older for\n\n191\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.460\nolder versions, but still real helpful\nif you haven't dealt with this before,\n\n192\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.360\nto go out and take a look.\n\n193\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.400\nSo maybe worth a couple\nminutes of your time.\n\n194\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.680\nGo take a look at that.\n\n195\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.500\nThe refluidity tool is here as well, again\nif I can just grab that link real quick,\n\n196\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.980\nI'll just pop that in just so\nyou can see it in the show notes.\n\n197\n00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.280\nEncourage you to take a look, obviously,\nand just make sure you go out there and\n\n198\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.140\nyou'll see what the tool's all about.\n\n199\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.840\nYou can see it here.\n\n200\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.060\nMcAfee makes it available to you for free.\n\n201\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.360\nSo recycle bin forensics analysis tool,\nreally good tool.\n\n202\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.100\nDoes a good job.\n\n203\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.640\nAnd will allow you to pull that\ninformation in, as you can see.\n\n204\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.971\nAnd will be able to give that to you.\n\n205\n00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:31.830\nIt's a tab to limited MS Excel file,\nthat it puts out for you.\n\n206\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.250\nGives you all the information so\nyou can sort and filter it.\n\n207\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.950\nSo it's really easy to use.\n\n208\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.050\nAnd again,\nmay not work on every version of the OS.\n\n209\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.810\nYou're going to have to\nplay with it a little bit.\n\n210\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.450\nBut it's certainly useful for\nsome of the older ones.\n\n211\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.400\nSo it would be good for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n212\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.540\nThe system restore points, the rp.log\nfiles are always valuable to go after.\n\n213\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.004\nYou may wanna be thinking about that,\nexcuse me.\n\n214\n00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:54.530\nAgain, this is the system\nrestore function in Windows.\n\n215\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.550\nThe idea of essentially taking a snapshot,\nparking it on the hard drive, and\n\n216\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.020\nusing it to time travel backwards and\nforwards in Windows.\n\n217\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.310\nFunction that is built into,\nbasically Windows Vista Forward.\n\n218\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.370\nAnd you can certainly use it in any\nversion of the OS, it's often used,\n\n219\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.700\nit's often not.\n\n220\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.070\nIt sucks up a lot of space on the hard\ndrive, people may turn it off.\n\n221\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.920\nBut it's good to know that you\nshould be going to look for\n\n222\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.610\nthose files cuz if you can find them and\npull them up and grab those images,\n\n223\n00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.750\nwe can actually see what was going on with\nthe system at certain points in time.\n\n224\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.360\nSee all the information that\nwas available, gives us a great\n\n225\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.630\nhistorical reference point as\na panoramic view of the OS over time.\n\n226\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.890\nSo maybe worth your\ntime to take a look at.\n\n227\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.850\nThe log files indicate what kind\nof activity were taking place, so\n\n228\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.050\njust something to consider and\nthink about.\n\n229\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.818\nAlso we can take a look at prefetching.\n\n230\n00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:44.218\nAnd the prefetch files,\nas I mentioned here, are written or\n\n231\n00:10:44.218 --> 00:10:45.560\nwe use prefetch files.\n\n232\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.160\nThey have a .pf extension in\nthe Windows prefetch directory.\n\n233\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.110\nOnce we process data,\nwe're putting information in there,\n\n234\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.960\nstoring it, and keeping it so\nthat way it's easy to get to.\n\n235\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.060\nWe can work with it in real time.\n\n236\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.610\nThere's a lot of information\nthat may go in here.\n\n237\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.300\nUsually valuable to call those files.\n\n238\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.910\nWe control prefetching\nthrough the registry.\n\n239\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.252\nYou can see I gave you the registry key\nhere for that with prefetch parameters.\n\n240\n00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.750\nSo may be valuable to go and\ntake a look at what\n\n241\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.230\nit's been set out in terms of memory\nmanagement, how we're using it,\n\n242\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.630\nand then again go after those .pf files\nand you'd be able to open them up.\n\n243\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.850\nThey're essentially memory files.\n\n244\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.710\nYou're dumping content that's loaded\nin memory that is preloaded there so\n\n245\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.460\nthat way when we need to use it\nwe're fast out of the gate for\n\n246\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.140\nthese applications that require\naccess to that data transactionally.\n\n247\n00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.810\nSo we're getting real live app data,\nloaded in memory,\n\n248\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.390\nin the current state of the system\nwhen we look at these files.\n\n249\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.210\nAnd there may be valuable information\nabout hacking tools that were being used\n\n250\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.000\non the system that may have\nbeen loaded into memory.\n\n251\n00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.695\nA lot of time, rootkits and things like\nthat will operate this way, where they\n\n252\n00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:47.500\npreload certain information into memory so\nthey can operate all the time.\n\n253\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.090\nAnd we'll get evidence of that kind of\ninformation with the prefetching, and\n\n254\n00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.920\nwe may be able to reconstruct what\nhappened in the system as a result.\n\n255\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.450\nSo there may be value in\nlooking at those files.\n\n256\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.070\nAgain, you may need special tools to read\nsome of these because they're not in\n\n257\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.350\njust standard open it up in text and\nsee all that format.\n\n258\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.110\nA lot of this is in hex.\n\n259\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.150\nYou're gonna have to use hex editors or\nthe equivalent to translate this data, but\n\n260\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.730\nwe've shown you a few different\nmethods to do that up until now.\n\n261\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.370\nYou obviously can reason\nthrough some of that as you go.\n\n262\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.520\nThere is, and are, Pearl scripts.\n\n263\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.077\nI mentioned them in a couple of prior\nepisodes, that may be valuable for\n\n264\n00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:24.110\nlooking at metadata on things like\nWord documents, PDF documents, etc.\n\n265\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.760\nSo you can Google for some of these\nscripts that you can then modify and\n\n266\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.340\nrun as needed, but they'll contain or\ndump the contents and\n\n267\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.760\nmetadata revision history\netc around the documents.\n\n268\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.370\nWhen you go in and you look at let's\nsay a Word document like the one\n\n269\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.310\nwe were just looking at,\nthis start up location document.\n\n270\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.810\nA lot of times I'm using Word Viewer,\nI'm not using Microsoft Word.\n\n271\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.110\nSo obviously we're not gonna have\naccess to the same set of tools.\n\n272\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.060\nAnd you don't really see the metadata the\nsame way you would, but when you go in,\n\n273\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.475\nright, even then you're seeing that\nwe're looking at just general metadata.\n\n274\n00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.135\nYou could see general\ndata on the document,\n\n275\n00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:04.535\ngeneral information about\nwhere it's stored, etc.\n\n276\n00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:06.665\nIf there was any stuff like title,\nsubject,\n\n277\n00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:09.115\nauthor, you would see\nthe basic metadata here.\n\n278\n00:13:09.115 --> 00:13:12.365\nWe could see the same thing that\nwe see when we use Word fully, and\n\n279\n00:13:12.365 --> 00:13:14.395\nwe can go to File Properties\nto take a look.\n\n280\n00:13:14.395 --> 00:13:17.765\nThis is the kind of stuff that\nwe would be able to pull and\n\n281\n00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:21.280\npotentially gain insight into or\ngain insight from.\n\n282\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.520\nSo don't underestimate the metadata\non any of these documents.\n\n283\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.910\nPDFs have it buried\ninside of them as well.\n\n284\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.960\nUsually helpful, usually valuable,\nso you should probably take a look.\n\n285\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.120\nFile signature analysis is\nusually helpful as well.\n\n286\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.650\nExecutable file analysis,\nyou have the idea of looking at static\n\n287\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.430\nversus dynamic code,\nhow we're gonna look at the code.\n\n288\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.790\nAre we gonna just look at it as a one off\nInternet or not executed, not to see what\n\n289\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.430\nit does, put it in a sandbox and\nrun it, see what happens to it.\n\n290\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.808\nSo the dependency walker tool is a good\ntool to be able to use to be able to find\n\n291\n00:13:51.808 --> 00:13:56.396\nthe dependency linkages for the executable\nif we break it apart, open it up and\n\n292\n00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:59.920\nstart to decompile it and\nsee what's going on with it.\n\n293\n00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.415\nSo we may want to do some of that.\n\n294\n00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:04.000\nDependencywalker.com is\nwhere we find the tool.\n\n295\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.770\nIn one of the upcoming episodes I'll\nshow you how to use a tool like this to\n\n296\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.780\nlook at the dependency map of data\nthat we pull, either from memory or\n\n297\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.350\nfrom an image in real time.\n\n298\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.310\nWe look at the dependency of\nan executable as we break it apart.\n\n299\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.450\nWe do the malware discussions,\nthe malware forensics, further out.\n\n300\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.440\nWill take a look at some of that,\nand show you how that works.\n\n301\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.557\nWindows logon event types.\n\n302\n00:14:23.557 --> 00:14:27.379\nThe wevtutil,\nit's the Windows event utility,\n\n303\n00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:30.760\nlet's us look at all this information.\n\n304\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.510\nAnd there's a little nice blog\nentry here that breaks down\n\n305\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.830\nall different log on types, tells us what\nthey mean, that I referenced for you.\n\n306\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.215\nYou can get wevtutil, you can download it,\nit's a very simple tool to find.\n\n307\n00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:44.250\nBut what often happens is you\nget all of these event IDs,\n\n308\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.370\nyou may not remember what they are,\nyou're always Googling for them.\n\n309\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.690\nI put together a list for you,\n\n310\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.800\nthe most common ones, made a little\ntable here in the show notes for you.\n\n311\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.842\nIt's not a little table,\nit's actually a pretty long table.\n\n312\n00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:55.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But put together about the top 15 or so\n\n313\n00:14:55.135 --> 00:14:59.379\ncommon entries on the security side that\ntell us the things that may be valuable\n\n314\n00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:03.170\nto what we want to know about Windows\nlogon codes in the event IDs.\n\n315\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.680\nLot of times I'll get asked about these.\n\n316\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.770\nYou may see them on an exam.\n\n317\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.290\nCertainly good to know them there.\n\n318\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.060\nIn the real world,\nyou do what everybody else does.\n\n319\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.410\nYou don't walk around\nremembering this stuff.\n\n320\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.830\nYou Google these when you need them.\n\n321\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.100\nYou just don't need them all that often.\n\n322\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.690\nBut I thought it'd be good to have\nthem as referencable material for\n\n323\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.200\nyou in the notes.\n\n324\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.320\nSo put them in there for you.\n\n325\n00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.600\nYou can obviously download them.\n\n326\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.630\nGood for flash cards, by the way,\ngreat way to learn that kinda stuff.\n\n327\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.740\nMake a couple flash cards,\nget somebody to test you, right.\n\n328\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.330\nThe trick is you can't do\nthat in front of a mirror.\n\n329\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because then you cheat.\n\n330\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.350\nYou put one up and you see the other side.\n\n331\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.560\n&gt;&gt; There's a website,\nand you can actually,\n\n332\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.920\nyou can create your own flashcard sets.\n\n333\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Several, several.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they're great.\n\n334\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.695\n&gt;&gt; Quizlet.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n335\n00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Quizlet.com.\n\n336\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.340\nMany of them out there that you can do.\n\n337\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.830\nI often tell my students,\ngo to Quizlet cuz it's free.\n\n338\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.500\nYou create an account,\nbut it's essentially free.\n\n339\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.070\nBut you see other people's flashcard sets,\nto your point.\n\n340\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.930\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; They post them up and\n\n341\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.990\nthey're available for\nyou so you can use them.\n\n342\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.300\nOr you can create your own as long as\nthe person that created them was good,\n\n343\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.370\nknew what they were doing,\nthose are perfectly valid to use.\n\n344\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.160\nSo maybe valuable there.\n\n345\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.820\nA little bit about logs.\n\n346\n00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.540\nWe'll see logs coming up in the next\nconversations in the network forensics\n\n347\n00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.310\ndiscussion as well.\n\n348\n00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.258\nVery valuable, gotta know about those.\n\n349\n00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:03.342\nBut IS logs obviously important if\nwe're running a web server to have\n\n350\n00:16:03.342 --> 00:16:05.270\nknowledge of those, know where they are.\n\n351\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.298\nManaged through the IS console,\n\n352\n00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:12.360\nFTP logs are stored int he windows\ndirectories in System32 in the log files.\n\n353\n00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.700\nAnd the FTP service sub directory,\n\n354\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.570\nthey have a specific format\nas you can see there.\n\n355\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.970\nIt should actually be like that,\na little space there, sorry about that.\n\n356\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.950\nAnd you'll see you could go in and take\na look, and you can find log files and\n\n357\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.140\nread up on those.\n\n358\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.440\nThe DHCP server logs are stored\nin the System32\\DHCP directory.\n\n359\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.650\nThe Windows Firewall logs\nare gonna be in the Windows EVT,\n\n360\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:38.600\nthe event logs, Microsoft Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n361\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.820\nIt'll be all there.\n\n362\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.070\nAgain, you're just looking for\nevtx instantions for the event logs.\n\n363\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.990\nAnd when I say the event logs\nwhat I'm talking about literally,\n\n364\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.500\nis going in and we are going to,\n\n365\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.110\nin the case of Windows, just going into\nControl Panel, Administrative Tools.\n\n366\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.200\nWe go to Event Viewer.\n\n367\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:56.957\nSo just bring this up.\n\n368\n00:16:56.957 --> 00:16:58.589\nThis is Windows 10.\n\n369\n00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:00.710\nJust make this full screen so we can see.\n\n370\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.570\nAnd you'll see here,\njust open this up so you can see.\n\n371\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.910\nWe have Application and Service Logs.\n\n372\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.297\nSo there's PowerShell,\nthere's Key Manager, IE,\n\n373\n00:17:09.297 --> 00:17:12.987\nRight here's under Microsoft,\nApp-V, Windows, etc.\n\n374\n00:17:12.987 --> 00:17:16.856\nYou could see all of the different\nthings that are listed here,\n\n375\n00:17:16.856 --> 00:17:20.370\nas we scroll down literally\njust got them all right here.\n\n376\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.610\nThere's the firewall with advanced\nsecurity, we were just talking about so\n\n377\n00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.540\nthose log files for\nthe firewall are right here.\n\n378\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.690\nNetwork isolation, the firewall itself,\nso the firewall is running.\n\n379\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.260\nThis would be good for us,\nas investigators to go in and look at, but\n\n380\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.880\nremember again, we capture all this data\nstatically when we get a drive image.\n\n381\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.330\nWe can look at all this offline.\n\n382\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.960\nYou should not be looking at these\nright now with the system running live,\n\n383\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.570\ntrying to figure out how to capture\nvolatile data, establish and maintain\n\n384\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.620\nchain of custody, worry about modification\nof timestamps and file integrity.\n\n385\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.460\nSo I want a bulk image to all this stuff.\n\n386\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.560\nAnd then, just start carving\nit up after the fact offline\n\n387\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.870\nbecause all this is static data.\n\n388\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.320\nThis is not going anywhere.\n\n389\n00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.440\nIt's not dynamic as long as you capture\nit and properly ensure integrity,\n\n390\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.190\nyou're not gonna have to worry\nabout modification of system files\n\n391\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.340\ngetting in the way of you creating\nthe proper chain of custody.\n\n392\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.020\nSo you can look at this stuff\noffline after the fact.\n\n393\n00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.330\nBut knowing what event files or\nlogs are there,\n\n394\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.480\nknowing where to go, knowing that it is\navailable to you is gonna be important.\n\n395\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.540\nSo just make sure that you're\naware of the fact that literally\n\n396\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.360\nevery application that runs,\nconsequence, if it's Microsoft base,\n\n397\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.120\nit's gonna have a log\nassociated with it right here.\n\n398\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.380\nMost services as you can see are there,\nas well.\n\n399\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.560\nWe can get quite a bit of information.\n\n400\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.580\nJust by going in and taking a look here.\n\n401\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.190\nWindows Remote Management, Windows Backup,\nWinlogon, WinHTTP, Windows Update.\n\n402\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.020\nThe list just goes on and on and on.\n\n403\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.887\nWLAN, Wireless LAN, autoconfig,\nall those system applications,\n\n404\n00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:50.569\nall those services, all those programs,\nare all sitting there.\n\n405\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.820\nBefore we go into Linux and\ntalk about Linux and Mac,\n\n406\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.670\nthought it'd be good just to go back.\n\n407\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.830\nI threw some of the tools up\nin one of our earlier demos.\n\n408\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.080\nI brought up Helix for you.\n\n409\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.370\nWe took a look at that.\n\n410\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.950\nWe had some tools running in the Windows\ndemo environment that we were looking at.\n\n411\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.510\nI had the OS forensics tool up.\n\n412\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.660\nI said, hey, we can do all the stuff.\n\n413\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.490\nShowed you one or two things.\n\n414\n00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.630\nBut they didn't really come back.\n\n415\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.904\nDidn't really do much with it.\n\n416\n00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:17.219\nI thought it would be good just to wrap up\nour Windows portion of the OS forensics\n\n417\n00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:20.285\nconversation with just maybe a quick\nreview of a couple of the things that\n\n418\n00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.850\ntools like this could do for us.\n\n419\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.360\nJust give you a little bit of a narrative\nabout the way we may establish a case, and\n\n420\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.400\nwhat we may do.\n\n421\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.816\nThinking back to that Windows\nmethodology specifically volatile data,\n\n422\n00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:34.027\nnon volatile data,\nkinda walk into the eight steps.\n\n423\n00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.220\nThat we went through in the very\nfirst episodes in this series.\n\n424\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.840\nAnd they can sure we're\ncomfortable at this.\n\n425\n00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.830\nTry it again, a tool like this,\n30 day trial license, you install it,\n\n426\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.250\nyou use it, you like it, you buy it.\n\n427\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.720\nEither install it again on a different\nmachine, turn the clock back or\n\n428\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.205\nget something under demo.\n\n429\n00:19:49.205 --> 00:19:50.590\nBut we let you play with the tools.\n\n430\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.530\nThat's the important part.\n\n431\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.950\nSo this is a case management tool,\na la, Encase,\n\n432\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.388\na la,\nthe Autopsy tool that we've talked about.\n\n433\n00:19:58.388 --> 00:20:02.770\nAll these different case managers let you\nbuild the meta-data around describing what\n\n434\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.130\nwe call the artifacts, all the different\ncomponents, which you're gonna put in and\n\n435\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.070\nbuild your case around, and then give you\nthe tools to be able to do that, as well.\n\n436\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.830\nThey have reporting capabilities, so\nwe have the ability that once we get done,\n\n437\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.070\nto spit out a case report.\n\n438\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.180\nIt's how we report and\n\n439\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.570\npresent that evidence, to our customer, in\na court of law, whatever the case may be.\n\n440\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.080\nThe nice thing about using\nthe standardized tool,\n\n441\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.720\nis that those reports tend to\ncome out in a standardized form.\n\n442\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.470\nSo they're easily consumable and\ntransferable to other parties.\n\n443\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.320\nWe talk about this at some of the later\nconversations towards the end,\n\n444\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.390\nof our time together,\nabout the CHFI body of knowledge\n\n445\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.190\nwhere we talk about what it means\nto actually be an expert witness.\n\n446\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.840\nHow do we present testimony?\n\n447\n00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.930\nHow do we do this?\n\n448\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.490\nHow do we walk through?\n\n449\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.900\nHow do we generate reports?\n\n450\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.989\nYou walk through the methodology\nof doing all that.\n\n451\n00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:46.730\nI have a couple shows\ndedicated to that and\n\n452\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.580\nwe'll go through in detail how this\ncomes together and what you do.\n\n453\n00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.730\nBut we may wanna create a case.\n\n454\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.400\nSo create a case case name.\n\n455\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:01.510\nITProTV Case 123, or whatever it may be.\n\n456\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.380\nWho's the investigator?\n\n457\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.130\nSo put your name in there.\n\n458\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.960\nThe organization that we are working for.\n\n459\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.440\nContact details.\n\n460\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.003\nTime zone, the default driver where\nyou're gonna store everything.\n\n461\n00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:16.283\nAre we gonna use acquisition\nof the current machine or\n\n462\n00:21:16.283 --> 00:21:18.620\nare we gonna investigate\ndistrib of another machine.\n\n463\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.950\nThat's where we're getting our data from.\n\n464\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.359\nIt's just a drive image\nwe're gonna import.\n\n465\n00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:24.743\nAnd this is for\nus a workstation that's clean.\n\n466\n00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.962\nWe're gonna mount the data,\n\n467\n00:21:25.962 --> 00:21:28.610\nor are we running this on the machine\nthat we wanna investigate.\n\n468\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.190\nOr are we gonna pull the data\nout as part of creation in case?\n\n469\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.670\nThat's up to us to decide.\n\n470\n00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.790\nAnd then, case folder default or\ncustom location?\n\n471\n00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.130\nYou log case activity.\n\n472\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.407\nLog everything there.\n\n473\n00:21:40.407 --> 00:21:43.280\nSo we can investigate disk\nfrom another machine.\n\n474\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.917\nLog that, click OK.\n\n475\n00:21:44.917 --> 00:21:46.550\nSo we got our case there.\n\n476\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.535\nNew case, load case, edit case details.\n\n477\n00:21:49.535 --> 00:21:54.560\nCase items, wanna open something,\nwhatever the case may be, we could start\n\n478\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.210\nsearching and now, if we go over here and\nperhaps we wanna use some of our tools, so\n\n479\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.870\nmaybe we can go in, start loading\nan image, a disk image, a DD image.\n\n480\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.992\nAnd then, we can go ahead and\nstart looking for data.\n\n481\n00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:09.833\nI already showed you the memory viewer,\nbut\n\n482\n00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:11.620\nmaybe we wanna load our raw disk viewer.\n\n483\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.470\nSo let's load that.\n\n484\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.710\nScan and drive, so\nyou could see that we're bringing this up,\n\n485\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.715\nthis is the physical drive on the local\nmachine, maybe we wanna mount a different\n\n486\n00:22:19.715 --> 00:22:22.590\nimage, a different partition,\ndifferent ways to use the tool.\n\n487\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.220\nBut I can mount this, and I can actually\nsee, and when we did the hard drive\n\n488\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.640\ndiscussions, we went through the fact\nthat this is all the hex data.\n\n489\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.230\nI can actually go in and I'm looking at\nthe raw drive data on the hard drive.\n\n490\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.930\nAnd the parts that are green,\nhas data, the parts that's white here\n\n491\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.210\ndoesn't have any data in it, now,\nit's just an empty space on the drive.\n\n492\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.840\nSo you could see there's just all sorts of\nstuff sitting here, and I would have to go\n\n493\n00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.290\nin, I have to start examining this,\nI can jump, I can search, I can decode.\n\n494\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.090\nRight click on the disk for\nadditional options.\n\n495\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.990\nI can carve selections out.\n\n496\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.160\nThis is a full fashioned disk getter,\nlike Access FDK or\n\n497\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.190\nany of the other ones we've shown you.\n\n498\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.050\nSo I can go in,\nI can copy the hex or the ASCII.\n\n499\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.487\nI can go in, and I can read\nthe actual range of data that I want.\n\n500\n00:23:05.487 --> 00:23:08.000\nAnd then, edit this, or\nput this into a separate tool.\n\n501\n00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.950\nAnd then, be able to digest this and\nkinda examine it and\n\n502\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.050\nsee what's going on with it.\n\n503\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.780\nSo we can go in and\nwe can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n504\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.360\nI can bookmark and tag areas of the drive.\n\n505\n00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.390\nRemember, I would not be\ndoing this live on the drive.\n\n506\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.160\nI would copy the drive and then do all\nthis offline, but the idea would be\n\n507\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.620\nthat I can begin to interrogate\nthe system and look for all this data.\n\n508\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:34.190\nSo that could be valuable, we can go in,\nscroll down here real quick,\n\n509\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:39.440\nwe can look at file and hex data, so we\ncan look at hex viewers, look at memory.\n\n510\n00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.160\nRegistry Viewer, like I told you this\nhas a built-in Registry Viewer so\n\n511\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.710\nessentially like RegEdit.\n\n512\n00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.494\nYou tell it what viewer or\nwhat hives you wanna open so\n\n513\n00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:51.605\nyou can see it just lets us go in, browse\neach drive that we see if there´s more\n\n514\n00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:54.105\nthan one in place where\nthe registry might be.\n\n515\n00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:58.624\nSo if I wanna go in, open something like\nthe Sam Hive, or the default, or system,\n\n516\n00:23:58.624 --> 00:24:03.406\nor software, highlight the appropriate one\nthat´s gonna go in, try to mount that and\n\n517\n00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:05.523\nthen see if I can actually hex Edit it.\n\n518\n00:24:05.523 --> 00:24:06.850\nYou'll see this one's not gonna respond.\n\n519\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.113\nI'm not gonna open the SAM hive live\nwhile the system's running, but\n\n520\n00:24:10.113 --> 00:24:11.338\nyou get the general idea.\n\n521\n00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:13.100\nFile system browser.\n\n522\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.290\nI mentioned we could go in,\nuse the SQL Lite browser.\n\n523\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.997\nThere we go, let's try to mount it, but\nthere's nothing that I'm gonna get in\n\n524\n00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:23.172\nthe SAM hive,\nas you can see right here, right?\n\n525\n00:24:25.616 --> 00:24:30.013\nNot gonna really get much other than\njust the individual user folder for\n\n526\n00:24:30.013 --> 00:24:31.120\neach user alias.\n\n527\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.970\nAnd I have to then go in and decode.\n\n528\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.040\nBut SQL Lite Browser,\nI can go in and mount a database.\n\n529\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.030\nI have several SQL databases that I use\nin the database forensics chapter that's\n\n530\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.550\ncoming up, the conversations there.\n\n531\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.820\nJust a preview,\ncuz we'll take a look at these there.\n\n532\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.460\nBut I've just taken one of the SQL Lite\ndatabases that I have, and\n\n533\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:47.990\nI've mounted it.\n\n534\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.690\nAnd you could see there's\na couple accounts in here.\n\n535\n00:24:51.024 --> 00:24:54.910\nWhatsapp, information from a whatsapp\ndatabase on a mobile device.\n\n536\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.180\nSo you could see that there.\n\n537\n00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.740\nSo I'm able to see the account.\n\n538\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.330\nI can see the metadata,\n\n539\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.740\ndifferent things that may be valuable\ndepending on what's in here, right?\n\n540\n00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.295\nNot much in this first one,\nit's really just the account.\n\n541\n00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:09.300\nENUS tells me it's an English version, and\nI can see just some basic information.\n\n542\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.600\nBut I can go in and\n\n543\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.870\nI can load different databases in here\njust depending on what I'm looking for.\n\n544\n00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.320\nGot a whole bunch of different\nones that may be available, right?\n\n545\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.590\nSo, I can go in, and you'll see I've\ngot a whole bunch of different files.\n\n546\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.030\nAnd I can go in and just mount\nanyone that I want to mount, right?\n\n547\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.880\nMessage store, for instance, or\nsomething like that, whatever it may be.\n\n548\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.160\nAnd I can load up the appropriate ones,\nand then just depending on what I see,\n\n549\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.380\nI'm able to read that data.\n\n550\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.689\nAnd you'll see more about that,\n\n551\n00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:39.570\nI'll show you how to do more of\nthat in one of the upcoming ones.\n\n552\n00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.370\nJust wait for\nthe tool to catch up with me.\n\n553\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.070\nWe have a built in web-browser,\nwe can go and\n\n554\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.100\ndump the caches that we were\ntalking about, for instance.\n\n555\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.872\nSystem information, right?\n\n556\n00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:52.510\nGives us a list of basic DOS commands,\nall commands,\n\n557\n00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.220\nthings that are supported,\nsystem information from the registry.\n\n558\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.350\nJust a bunch of different stuff that\nmay be valuable that we wanna look at.\n\n559\n00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.805\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent capabilities.\n\n560\n00:26:01.805 --> 00:26:03.790\nJust go up to the top here.\n\n561\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.390\nLot of different capabilities\nin a tool like this.\n\n562\n00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.420\nRemember, we were just talking\nabout prefetch, the prefetch files?\n\n563\n00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.960\nSo prefetch viewer.\n\n564\n00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.780\nI can go in and\nsee if there's any prefetch files.\n\n565\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.780\nIf there are any sitting on one\nof the drives, I can find them.\n\n566\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.636\nThere are none right here.\n\n567\n00:26:19.636 --> 00:26:21.823\nBut if there were,\nI'd be able to look at them,\n\n568\n00:26:21.823 --> 00:26:25.080\nsee what's mapped in them from memory,\nand be able to read that data.\n\n569\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.040\nSo tools like this would be very valuable\ncuz they give us a lot of different\n\n570\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.780\nopportunities, a whole bunch of different\ntools in essentially a suite, right?\n\n571\n00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.350\nThat we can use in concert with one\nanother to see all the different\n\n572\n00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.040\ninformation that I may wanna see.\n\n573\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.810\nI can mount a drive image, right?\n\n574\n00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.710\nSo you'll see I've got the raw image\nright here that I can go in and look at.\n\n575\n00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.770\nThis is the standard one that we've just\nbeen demoing off of, and can load all that\n\n576\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.970\ninformation, take a look at all\nthe different things that are in there.\n\n577\n00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.750\nAnd you've seen me do this in\na couple of different shows.\n\n578\n00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.230\nYou'll see it coming up in\nadditional shows as well.\n\n579\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:01.740\nBut I can mount it, I can then explore\nthat DD or raw device map image.\n\n580\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.080\nI can look at this,\ncreate removable drive partitions.\n\n581\n00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.000\nI can run to external drive with write\nblocker to be able to create images.\n\n582\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.660\nAll sorts of stuff out of this tool, it's\nvery powerful set of tools that we have.\n\n583\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.750\nWe took a look at the process\nexplorer as well, right?\n\n584\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.440\nSo we can see what's running.\n\n585\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.730\nI showed you that a tool like this\ncan be very valuable to be able to\n\n586\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.910\nmanipulate processes.\n\n587\n00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.680\nBut also to create the dump file, right?\n\n588\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.260\nAnd so, if we take this,\ncreate a dump file.\n\n589\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.840\nJust put that out on the desktop there.\n\n590\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.280\nAnd dump the contents of svchost or\nwhatever I'm doing,\n\n591\n00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.320\nwhatever process that is, right?\n\n592\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.950\nI could take that dump file,\nwhich is sitting right here, and\n\n593\n00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.830\nI could then take that dump file, and\nthat's the contents of live memory, right?\n\n594\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.330\nEssentially that's volatile data I\njust captured for the process running.\n\n595\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.120\nI could open that up in an OS forensics\ntool such as the one we were just looking\n\n596\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.890\nat, and I can then explore the hex for\nthe memory, load it into a hex viewer, and\n\n597\n00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.290\nactually see what's going on in memory for\nthat process.\n\n598\n00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.410\nSo wouldn't be very hard for me to grab\nthat data using some of these tools, and\n\n599\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.680\ninteract between them to be able\nto examine what's happening.\n\n600\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.314\nWe showed you the event log viewer and\nwhat we could do with that.\n\n601\n00:28:09.314 --> 00:28:12.350\nAnd just wanted to kinda bring\nthese tools back together,\n\n602\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.730\nshow you how we can leverage a central\ntool set like the OS forensics tool\n\n603\n00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.530\nwith something like a process\nexplorer to get a memory dump.\n\n604\n00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.300\nAnd then use those tools to\nstart building the artifacts for\n\n605\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.810\nour forensic presentation or for our case.\n\n606\n00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.990\nIn this case in the Windows OS.\n\n607\n00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.900\nSo helpful for us to be able to\nsee how all that comes together.\n\n608\n00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, defiantly very\ncool stuff here at the end of,\n\n609\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.660\nas we close the chapter\non Windows forensics,\n\n610\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.990\ntrying o find out all the important and\ninteresting areas inside of the Windows\n\n611\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:43.970\noperating system that we might be\nlooking for forensic information.\n\n612\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.500\nThere's lots of nooks and\ncrannies going on there in Windows OS.\n\n613\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.420\nVery important for\nus as forensic investigators.\n\n614\n00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.330\nLooking forward to seeing what you've got\nin store for us when it comes to Linux and\n\n615\n00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.320\nMac as well.\n\n616\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.200\nI know that the exam\ndoesn't go as in depth\n\n617\n00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.970\ninto those operating systems\nas they do with Windows, but\n\n618\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.230\nit's always a good time to open up\nthe hood and see what's underneath there.\n\n619\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.950\nAll right-\n&gt;&gt; We'll talk about some tools,\n\n620\n00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.850\ngive you a little insight into\nhow some of those tools work,\n\n621\n00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:07.830\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n622\n00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.520\nWe'll give you all the command lines you\nneed and all that kind of stuff, and\n\n623\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.040\nmaybe throw a few other\nthings in there as well.\n\n624\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.390\n&gt;&gt; It'll be a good time had by all.\n\n625\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.910\nSo definitely join us back for\nthe next episode.\n\n626\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.690\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare at the end of this episode.\n\n627\n00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.300\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n628\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.950\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n629\n00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm that Windows guy.\n\n630\n00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.350\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.817\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n632\n00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:34.801\n[MUSIC]\n\n633\n00:29:34.801 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.510\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.360\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode it is all about\n\n7\n00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.650\nthe CHFI version 9,\nspecifically operating system forensics.\n\n8\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.629\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain,\n\n9\n00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:31.730\nlike a day without sunshine it would be\nwithout our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.030\nAdam, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.750\nI was just pondering the day\nwithout sunshine, but\n\n13\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.830\nI looked outside because we could do\nthat in this studio which is awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.605\nYou have to see.\n\n15\n00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful bay window looking out\non the lobby here at ITProTV and\n\n16\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.020\nsee out to the parking lot.\n\n17\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.510\nIts a bright sunny day outside, which we\ncould not have said last time I was here.\n\n18\n00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.940\n&gt;&gt; It's 114 degrees.\n\n19\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.371\n&gt;&gt; It is burning hot out there, but\n\n20\n00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:54.442\nactually you know what\nI saw over the weekend?\n\n21\n00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:55.737\nWe were talking about movies.\n\n22\n00:00:55.737 --> 00:00:59.146\nI didn't see this on the plane, I saw this\nafter I got back, but they were showing\n\n23\n00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:02.370\na bunch of old movies this weekend And\nI sat down and I saw Lawrence of Arabia.\n\n24\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.670\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh,four hours of movie goodness.\n\n25\n00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.440\nTalk about a great way\nto spend an afternoon.\n\n26\n00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.960\nRight up there with The Godfather.\n\n27\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.070\n&gt;&gt; It's a long flick, but\nwell worth the investment.\n\n28\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and we have the whole Star Wars\ntime so who plays King Faisal?\n\n29\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020\nThe future King Faisal.\n\n30\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.720\nAlec Guiness.\n\n31\n00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n32\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.900\n&gt;&gt; Obi Wan.\n\n33\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.670\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n34\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.870\n&gt;&gt; He was a young man in this.\n\n35\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.380\nThey did it back in the 60s but, very\nearly in his career on the beginning side.\n\n36\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.199\nCuz he had already been an actor for\n\n37\n00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:30.890\nmany years by the time he\nwas in Lawrence Arabia.\n\n38\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.770\nA very famous actor.\n\n39\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.250\nBut he plays who will become King Faisal\nwhen they found Saudi Arabia later.\n\n40\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.500\nBut he plays the original king.\n\n41\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.250\nHe plays King Faisal.\n\n42\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n43\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n44\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.640\nSo it's a really good movie.\n\n45\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.310\nIncredible movie.\n\n46\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.650\nAnyway, I digress.\n\n47\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.316\nNothing to do with operating system\nforensics here but if you have the chance\n\n48\n00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:50.171\ngot four and a half hours to kill with\nnothing better to do, Lawrence of Arabia.\n\n49\n00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:52.170\nPeter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn.\n\n50\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Get some culture.\n\n51\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.160\n&gt;&gt; Cast was just\nunbelievable in this movie.\n\n52\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.130\nVery good.\n\n53\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.608\nAnyway, so Linux forensics.\n\n54\n00:01:57.608 --> 00:01:59.583\nLet's talk a bit about Linux forensics.\n\n55\n00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.430\nWe talk a lot about Windows up until now.\n\n56\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.280\nDon't wanna leave out Linux,\ndon't wanna leave out the Mac OS either.\n\n57\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.185\nWe're gonna have a little\nbit to say about that.\n\n58\n00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:10.580\nYet when it comes down to Linux forensics,\na lot of the same rules apply,\n\n59\n00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.550\na lot of the same thought processes apply.\n\n60\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.940\nWe got a lot of commands we can run,\nshell commands to leverage, investigate,\n\n61\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.020\nuse, to find some data.\n\n62\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.660\nWhy don't you join me here on the veranda,\nwe'll take a look.\n\n63\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.670\nThere we go.\n\n64\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.800\nAnd so we just listed some of\nthe more common commands for you.\n\n65\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.722\nLet me do the following.\n\n66\n00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:26.975\nLet's go full screen if you would.\n\n67\n00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:28.120\nA, we're gonna cover part of this and B,\n\n68\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.470\nyou can see the part that's cut off\non the side there when we do this.\n\n69\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.300\nSo dmesg you can see here.\n\n70\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.610\nThis is the kernel ring buffer.\n\n71\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.800\nIt will display all\nthe information that's going on.\n\n72\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.510\nIf we have device driver issues for\ninstance, this will be good.\n\n73\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.260\nHelps us to understand what's loading and\n\n74\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.810\nwhat is going on as we load\ndrivers into the kernel, so\n\n75\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.360\nwe're looking at error messages and\nkernel information during boot.\n\n76\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.180\nSo dmesg, got some options here,\nI just put a little\n\n77\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.360\nline down between the commands to\nseparate them out as we go through them.\n\n78\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.890\nSo dmesg, grep, i for interface,\nwhatever the Ethernet interface is,\n\n79\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.620\nwhatever we wanna look at.\n\n80\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.940\nAnd then we can begin to see what's going\non with that, so may wanna use dmesg.\n\n81\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.540\nWe may want to look out,\nwe'll just scroll up so\n\n82\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.090\nthat we can kinda put them\nup there one at a time.\n\n83\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.010\nFsck, this checks consistency of the Linux\nfile systems, repairs damaged files.\n\n84\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.510\nThis is like the sig verif tool in\nWindows, you've seen me run that once or\n\n85\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.110\ntwice.\n\n86\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.380\nIf you haven't seen that before,\nif you don't remember it,\n\n87\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.000\njust take a look right\nhere while we're talking.\n\n88\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.380\nJust bring the run line\nup here real quick.\n\n89\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.190\nType sig verif in the run line in Windows,\nfile signature verification, another tool\n\n90\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.798\nthat can be used to check the integrity\nof the operating system core DLLs.\n\n91\n00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:38.250\nAnd the fsck tool is essentially\ngonna do that for us,\n\n92\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.440\nit's gonna check the consistency\non all the file systems files and\n\n93\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.740\nmake sure that they\nare going to have integrity.\n\n94\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.850\nSo that's what the fsck tool does.\n\n95\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.090\nfsck -A checks all the files.\n\n96\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.830\nStat.\n\n97\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.320\nJust roll down here.\n\n98\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.970\nThis goes in and displays file or\nsystem status information.\n\n99\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.680\nSo it allows us to be able to go in and\n\n100\n00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.990\nis allowing us to be able to see,\nas you can see, stat option.\n\n101\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.905\nFor instance, be able to see all the\ninformation on a file or the file system.\n\n102\n00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:08.380\nMetadata can be displayed here.\n\n103\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.500\nIt's the file actively being used, when\nwas it accessed, things of that nature for\n\n104\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.590\ninstance, right?\n\n105\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.910\nHistory checks and\nlists the bash shell commands.\n\n106\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.625\nRemember the DOS key, we talked about\nthat in one of the Windows episodes.\n\n107\n00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.865\nThis is kind of the equivalent\nin the Linux world.\n\n108\n00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:23.025\nThe history command.\n\n109\n00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:25.445\nHistory n will list a certain\nnumber of commands.\n\n110\n00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:27.625\nSo, you know, 20, 30,\nwhatever you want to see.\n\n111\n00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.595\nI think we had this conversation\nat one point, you and I.\n\n112\n00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:31.045\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about, hey, you know,\n\n113\n00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:33.520\ndo you ever go into look at that to\nkind of see what's been going on?\n\n114\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.560\nAnd we were talking about the different\nways you'd access those commands,\n\n115\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.000\nWindows versus Linux.\n\n116\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.880\nGrep, really wouldn't be a complete\nconversation without talking about grep.\n\n117\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.420\nYou gotta have...\n&gt;&gt; Greatest tool in Linux.\n\n118\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta have grep, right?\n\n119\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.590\nSo go out and you know essentially do\na text or contextual search or string\n\n120\n00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.780\nsearch, whatever you want to do looking\nfor information within one or more files.\n\n121\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.170\nYou're grepping something,\nlooking for that.\n\n122\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.260\nI'll give you an example of usage there or\nsyntax.\n\n123\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.400\nSo I've got a little Linux log files\ndocument I thought would be helpful.\n\n124\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.104\nI'll just pull this up real quick.\n\n125\n00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.876\nThis is gonna list for\nus the area where we'll find,\n\n126\n00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:12.012\nlet me just make sure,\nthat we're at 150%, we are.\n\n127\n00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:16.127\nYou know, we could probably go a little\nbit bigger on this one, do 160.\n\n128\n00:05:16.127 --> 00:05:18.540\nMake that just a little bigger,\na little bit easier to see.\n\n129\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.840\nThis is gonna list all the different\nlog paths for Linux distribution.\n\n130\n00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.050\nIt's got a little\ndistribution variance there.\n\n131\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.460\nYou may get a slight variation\ndepending on the particular distro or\n\n132\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.120\nbuild of Linux.\n\n133\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.290\nBut in general, across all\nthe variations on the Linux side,\n\n134\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.910\nthese paths hold pretty consistent.\n\n135\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.750\nA little description of each one.\n\n136\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.560\nSo var/log/auth.log, var/log/kern.log,\nfail.log, lpr.log, etc.\n\n137\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.750\nWhat do they do, what are they called?\n\n138\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.840\nWhy do we have them?\n\n139\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.690\nProbably a good idea to\nknow what these logs are.\n\n140\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.540\nAgain, you know,\nare you going to see these?\n\n141\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.790\nYou can see it's a one page document.\n\n142\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.310\nAre you going to see these in an exam?\n\n143\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.950\nYou know, you may.\n\n144\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.610\nDaniel made reference to the fact\nof the end of the last episode.\n\n145\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.130\nMay not go as hard on the Linux knowledge\nand the Mac OS knowledge as we do on\n\n146\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.230\nthe Windows knowledge in the exam, and\nobviously important to think about that.\n\n147\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.960\nIt doesn't mean we're gonna do that.\n\n148\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.840\nIt just means that we\nmay not use it as much.\n\n149\n00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.500\nDoesn't mean, though,\n\n150\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.130\nin the real world that you don't wanna\nknow about this information, right?\n\n151\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.710\nIt would be valuable and if you had this\nlittle half page document, got about 15,\n\n152\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.310\n20 entries there.\n\n153\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.165\nGives you the most common,\nmost logical logs you're likely to look at\n\n154\n00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:26.108\nand/or see in Linux, would be valuable for\nyou to know what they are.\n\n155\n00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:27.280\nAgain, laminate it.\n\n156\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.290\nHave five or\nten of these things back to back,\n\n157\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.980\nall the show notes tables\nstuff put together for it.\n\n158\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.410\nMakes a nice little handy run book\nthat you could have with you and\n\n159\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.300\nstart to use as your guide to help you\nkind of walk through this as you're\n\n160\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.320\nbeginning to get more comfortable with it,\nso maybe valuable there.\n\n161\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.608\nGot things like the MySQL log, got\nthe running services, so the daemon log.\n\n162\n00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:47.950\nThat's always an important\none to take a look at.\n\n163\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.110\nSee what's running.\n\n164\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.720\nAgain, that would be giving us\ninsight into things that may or\n\n165\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.700\nmay not be apparent by\nlooking at applications,\n\n166\n00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.460\nby looking at the equivalent of proc,\ncop, or list.\n\n167\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.380\nWe'd be able to cross-reference\nthat with the log and\n\n168\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.290\nfind out what's there, making sure\nwe're seeing everything, right?\n\n169\n00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.360\nPrinter log, the lpr,\nanother good one to take a look at.\n\n170\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.070\nWe talked about the importance\nof spooler files and\n\n171\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.870\ntemp files early on in one\nof the Windows discussions.\n\n172\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.260\nThis will be the equivalent\non the Linux side, right?\n\n173\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.290\nCron jobs.\n\n174\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.363\nI thought I saw cron there.\n\n175\n00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:16.292\nIt just went by.\n\n176\n00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:17.468\nThere it is right there.\n\n177\n00:07:17.468 --> 00:07:18.080\nCron jobs, so\n\n178\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.245\nthese are gonna be the equivalent of\ntasks that are scheduled or running.\n\n179\n00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:24.099\nStored procedures, you hear them\nreferred to in different ways but\n\n180\n00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.252\nessentially things that are scheduled,\nteed up,\n\n181\n00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:28.872\nrunning and/or the system controls and\nwould be available.\n\n182\n00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:29.760\nWanna see that.\n\n183\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.690\nMaybe somebody has planted\na logic bomb in there.\n\n184\n00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.890\nMaybe there is apiece of software\nthat runs every two hours and\n\n185\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.170\nbatches info out of the system, right?\n\n186\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.100\nA key logger that's calling home,\nyou never know what it is.\n\n187\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.660\nBut you may find it under\ncron in the Linux world.\n\n188\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.620\nIn Windows, you find it under\nthe at command scheduler or\n\n189\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.080\nthe Windows task scheduler.\n\n190\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.660\nYou'd be looking at that,\npulling up a list of all the tasks.\n\n191\n00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.910\nOr the command line, type in the task,\nor rather type in the command to see all\n\n192\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.971\nthe tasks, so you could see what's\nrunning there, that kind of thing.\n\n193\n00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:58.752\nThe boot log, last log,\nrecent logon info, user log,\n\n194\n00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:01.580\nwho has logged on under what conditions.\n\n195\n00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.517\nThese are all logs that are very\nimportant and very impactful.\n\n196\n00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:08.498\nFor us to look at with regards to Linux\nand understanding what's going on there.\n\n197\n00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:10.850\nSo it would be helpful for\nus to think about.\n\n198\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.400\nWhat about commands that help us to\ngather volatile data in the Linux world?\n\n199\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.990\nWe talked about this on the Windows side.\n\n200\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.050\nLet's go back and\ntake a look at some of those commands.\n\n201\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.970\nWe'll go back to full\nscreen here real quick.\n\n202\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.180\nSo you'll see here commands\nto gather volatile data.\n\n203\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.510\nStart with netstat, right?\n\n204\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.980\nWe use netstat in Windows, so not unusual.\n\n205\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.840\nlast -F tells us full user logon and\nlogout times and dates.\n\n206\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.360\nThat's helpful, right?\n\n207\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.410\nGood to know that.\n\n208\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.940\nhostname, that's pretty common.\n\n209\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.190\nWe use that in Windows.\n\n210\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.060\nifconfig instead of ipconfig, right?\n\n211\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.230\nLsof, list open files and\nprocesses that opened them.\n\n212\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.115\nI love that about Linux.\n\n213\n00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:45.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you can do\n\n214\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.712\nthis kind of obvious stuff and\nyou could say, how do I list those?\n\n215\n00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:51.050\nAnd sure enough,\nthere's probably a command that does that.\n\n216\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.452\nUnlike in Windows, where you know,\n\n217\n00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:55.490\nwe don't have necessarily the command\nthat does all of that in one place.\n\n218\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.720\nWe could see open files but\nto get open files and processes,\n\n219\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.700\nthere's not one command\nthat gives us all of that.\n\n220\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.950\nWe'd have to use some of those tricks and\ntools I showed you to put it all together.\n\n221\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.758\nSame thing with lsmod,\nyour loaded modules.\n\n222\n00:09:06.758 --> 00:09:11.660\nPrograms, or what we call modules in\nLinux are equivalent to programs and\n\n223\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.100\nfunctional elements in Windows.\n\n224\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.290\nDid I say that right?\n\n225\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.851\nI think I said it twice for Windows.\n\n226\n00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.370\nYou know what I mean.\n\n227\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.390\nModules are the equivalent of\nwhat we call them in Linux and\n\n228\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.610\nso displaying or\nlooking at loaded modules means\n\n229\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.480\nwe're gonna see all the programmatic\nfunctions that are available, right?\n\n230\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.390\nWe load a module, we're loading a program\nor an element that helps us to execute.\n\n231\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.860\nXclip lets us pull\nthe contents of the clipboard.\n\n232\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.638\nTalked about the clip viewer in Windows.\n\n233\n00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:41.790\nSo xclip -o would pull the contents\nout in Linux for the clipboard.\n\n234\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.835\nAureport, the summary report\nof the audit daemon logs\n\n235\n00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:47.355\ncan actually pull out information\nfrom the daemon logs.\n\n236\n00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.045\nRemember the daemon logs service logs,\nright?\n\n237\n00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:51.562\nSo you're seeing all the services.\n\n238\n00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:54.422\nRemember the first time,\nI talked to somebody about daemons\n\n239\n00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:57.502\nin a security class, and we were talking-\n&gt;&gt; They thought you were\n\n240\n00:09:57.502 --> 00:09:58.367\ntalking about Ferengi.\n\n241\n00:09:58.367 --> 00:09:59.032\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n242\n00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.622\ncuz I pronounced it like, yeah I think I\nsaid either daemon or demon, I said it's\n\n243\n00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:05.280\ndepending where you come from Yeah, you'll\nhear it referred to in one of these two\n\n244\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.134\nways, cuz a lot of my students would\ncall it demons when they first started.\n\n245\n00:10:10.134 --> 00:10:10.800\nThe demon log.\n\n246\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.580\nNo, not exactly.\n\n247\n00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.960\nClose, but not exactly.\n\n248\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.970\nSo I said it either way, so\nsomebody looked at me and\n\n249\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.420\neither had caught the tail end, or\njust didn't catch the right way, but\n\n250\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.240\nwasn't sure what I was talking about.\n\n251\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.670\nIt led to an interesting conversation\nabout why the devil is involved with IT.\n\n252\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.470\nFrom that point forward,\nI went out of my way\n\n253\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.270\nto ensure that I specified how\nwe pronounce that the right way.\n\n254\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.812\nSo, id, this is the command that lets\nus see the id of the current user.\n\n255\n00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:38.238\nAnd then, we use that with AU\nsearch to cross-reference if we.\n\n256\n00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:41.880\nSo you know, if we use these two together\nwe can use or get the user ID and\n\n257\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.600\nthen look in the daemon log.\n\n258\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.760\nWe can actually then find the ID's and\nreference them, cross a breeding or\n\n259\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.800\ncross pollinate and\ncross those two elements.\n\n260\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.560\nThe readelf, the executable linking format\nfiles, we could read the headers for\n\n261\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.490\nthat to tell what's been going on and\nseeing information may be valuable there.\n\n262\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.623\nWe could also verify the contents\nof the spool/cron and\n\n263\n00:11:02.623 --> 00:11:06.620\netc/cron.daily information about\nscheduled tasks, so we can go in.\n\n264\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.920\nAgain, we talked about what those would\nbe and why they would be important.\n\n265\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.970\nOne of the best ways people will booby\ntrap systems in Linux Unity is the Cron\n\n266\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.500\nand Windows is essentially, again, the\nACK Command Scheduler or Task Scheduler.\n\n267\n00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.410\nYou set up some sort of a logic bomb,\nand you have a kill switch.\n\n268\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.370\nIf you don't enter a command, or don't\nhit a keystroke, or something, either at\n\n269\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.880\na certain time interval, or when a certain\nthing is executed, you have a certain\n\n270\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.470\namount of time, or a certain key sequence\nto do, the system wipes itself clean.\n\n271\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.880\nWe find booby trapped systems all\nthe time when we do this kind of work.\n\n272\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.330\nAnd so checking these is very\nimportant because this is where you're\n\n273\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.830\ngonna find those potential hand grenades\nthat are waiting to go off, right?\n\n274\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.920\nThe bash history file.\n\n275\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.970\nWe've talked about the importance\nof looking at the shell,\n\n276\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.820\nwhat's been executed there.\n\n277\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.480\nThat'll give us the command history.\n\n278\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.780\nSo the history command will essentially\nparse that information, right?\n\n279\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.500\nGive that to you.\n\n280\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.310\nIt's another way of collecting that.\n\n281\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.610\nAlso the current state data\nfrom the /proc directory.\n\n282\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.690\nSo ps,\nwe talked about list running process.\n\n283\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.010\nArp, the arp cache.\n\n284\n00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.010\nCatting proc version will give\nyou the build information and\n\n285\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.930\nthe proper information on the Linux\nversion you're dealing with.\n\n286\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.550\nYou know people often overlook this,\nthey take this for granted.\n\n287\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.400\nIt's important in Windows,\nbut even more so in Linux.\n\n288\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.760\nThere's so many variations in\nLinux that we're dealing with.\n\n289\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.060\nIt's not just Red Hat, it could be\n20 different versions of Red Hat.\n\n290\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.450\nIt's not just Ubuntu, right?\n\n291\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.557\nThere's all these different ones.\n\n292\n00:12:23.557 --> 00:12:27.996\nAnd so we have to go in and we really have\nto be especially vigilant to understand\n\n293\n00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:32.173\nthe build we're working with,\nbecause certain capabilities, certain\n\n294\n00:12:32.173 --> 00:12:36.976\nfunctionality may vary by Linux distro,\nby Lindux distribution, and/or build.\n\n295\n00:12:36.976 --> 00:12:39.550\nNot as much as variation in Windows,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n296\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.890\nA lot more we see in Linux, especially\nwhen we get into the forensics and\n\n297\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.020\nsecurity builds where we have certain\ntools that are loaded and not loaded,\n\n298\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.770\nmodules, right?\n\n299\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.380\nIn other words, functionality or\nprogrammatic elements that may or\n\n300\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.250\nmay not be there.\n\n301\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.950\nThere's a lot of variation in that world.\n\n302\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.510\nSo it's actually pretty important to\ncat that and look at proc version.\n\n303\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.260\nFigure out exactly what\nwe're working with,\n\n304\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.900\ncuz it may not be apparent on the surface.\n\n305\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.060\nYou may look at it and go,\nwell, I think that's Red Hat.\n\n306\n00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.830\nProbably easy to figure that part out.\n\n307\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.600\nBut what version, what build,\nwill tell you exactly what to expect.\n\n308\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.980\nSo even more so than Windows,\ncatting the proc version.\n\n309\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.500\nI showed you winver in Windows.\n\n310\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.750\nEasy to execute to figure that out, but\n\n311\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.560\nthe equivalent here would\nbe cat proc version.\n\n312\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not like there's a bunch\nof Windows distributions running around.\n\n313\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.130\n&gt;&gt; Not normally.\n\n314\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.720\n&gt;&gt; There's Windows which comes from\nMicrosoft, and there you go, right?\n\n315\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.430\nNot normally.\n\n316\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.600\n&gt;&gt; No, not normally.\n\n317\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.820\nI mean, if there are, you're probably\nnot doing this the right way.\n\n318\n00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.870\nLet's put it that way.\n\n319\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.450\nYou've got a problem with unlicensed and\ncounterfeit software.\n\n320\n00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.810\n&gt;&gt; There's gonna be an auditor at your\nplace of business very, very shortly.\n\n321\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.970\n&gt;&gt; So we could also look at cat proc.\n\n322\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.240\nYou can see there sys kernel domain name,\nright, to get the domain name.\n\n323\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.830\nAgain, people don't often realize,\nLinux systems do join domains.\n\n324\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.340\nWe just don't refer to them necessarily\nthe same way and think of them but\n\n325\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.770\nthey are LDAP capable.\n\n326\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.290\nWe do have LDAP directory capabilities.\n\n327\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.360\nWe often leverage that In Linux, right?\n\n328\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.600\nSo realms are often what\nyou hear them referred to,\n\n329\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.530\nas opposed to just domains as well.\n\n330\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.912\nAnd so,\nwe wanna make sure we're aware of that and\n\n331\n00:13:57.912 --> 00:14:00.830\nwe know that that information\nis gonna be valuable, right?\n\n332\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.890\nCat /proc/swaps, the swap size.\n\n333\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.010\nAgain, we often overlook some of these\nfiles on the Linux side thinking,\n\n334\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.490\nmaybe they're not important or,\nmaybe they're not there.\n\n335\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.620\nIt's Windows.\n\n336\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.510\nWe have a paging file.\n\n337\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.360\nWell we've got the equivalent in Linux,\nwe just happen to call it a swap file.\n\n338\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.180\nIt's often called a swap\nfile in Windows as well.\n\n339\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.610\nIt's called the VSWP file,\n\n340\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.050\na virtual swap file in a lot of\nvirtual environments, right?\n\n341\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.760\nSo just keep in mind these\nare pretty standard, right?\n\n342\n00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.264\nOperating systems, plural, regardless\nof vendor, tend to be pretty similar\n\n343\n00:14:28.264 --> 00:14:32.070\nin how they approach a lot of\nthis core foundational stuff.\n\n344\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.920\nAnd, as a result, a lot of it is gonna be,\nother than the directory and\n\n345\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.870\nwhere we find it in terms of how to locate\nit, the function is fairly similar.\n\n346\n00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.320\nCat /proc/partitions,\nshow the list of disk partitions.\n\n347\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.880\nCpuinfo, CPU usage, proc/self/mounts\nshow the mounted external devices.\n\n348\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.240\nUSB, external drives.\n\n349\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.516\nOne of the things to look for there.\n\n350\n00:14:53.516 --> 00:14:55.480\nIn service,\nwe see this a lot in data centers.\n\n351\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.976\nHSM, hardware security modules, right?\n\n352\n00:14:57.976 --> 00:15:01.195\nSo we're talking about\nexternal data vaults or\n\n353\n00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:06.593\ncredential vaults that are being used\nto house certificates user ID's, etc.\n\n354\n00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:08.211\nIf you have a TPM,\na trusted platform module,\n\n355\n00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:10.591\nit's usually an internal piece of\nhardware running in the system.\n\n356\n00:15:10.591 --> 00:15:12.643\nThe equivalent for a lot of rack-mounts,\n\n357\n00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:15.730\nespecially in hosting environments\nthese days, are HSMs.\n\n358\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.000\nThey look like little mini\nexternal USB drives but\n\n359\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.920\nthey're plugged in through a USB port and\nthey're used as an external crypto vault.\n\n360\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.490\nSo essentially same idea,\nthey're just portable.\n\n361\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.310\nAnd you wanna be able to know\nthat there was one there or\n\n362\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.250\nat least have record of something even if\nit's not there anymore cuz that's where\n\n363\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.465\nyou're gonna have to go to find all those\ncredentials and look for that stuff so.\n\n364\n00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:38.390\nProc-ing, or excuse me, cat-ing\n/proc/self/mounts would give us evidence\n\n365\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.125\nof what may or may not have been in\nthe system, so again it's good to know.\n\n366\n00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:44.620\n/Proc/uptime, we talked about how\nto get system up time in Windows.\n\n367\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.530\nShowed you that trick with\nexporting the reg key and\n\n368\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.390\nthen looking at the last write\ntime to translate the binary.\n\n369\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.730\nRight?\nWe can run that Visual Basic\n\n370\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.710\nscript as well.\n\n371\n00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.554\nSo we can just go in and\ncat that directory.\n\n372\n00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:58.687\nRemember, cat is gonna be a program that\ngoes out, short for concatenate, query,\n\n373\n00:15:58.687 --> 00:16:01.380\nessentially read the information,\ndisplay it back.\n\n374\n00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.306\nWe're essentially just showing That\ninformation on the screen by cating it.\n\n375\n00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:05.831\nI just like that.\n\n376\n00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.407\nLinux has such cool tools.\n\n377\n00:16:07.407 --> 00:16:08.670\nI'm going to go cat something.\n\n378\n00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.285\nWhen was the last time you\ngot to say that in Windows?\n\n379\n00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:11.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to go load a program, right?\n\n380\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.890\nI get to cat something or grep something.\n\n381\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.670\n&gt;&gt; Or less.\n\n382\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.930\n&gt;&gt; Or less.\nRight, yeah, yeah.\n\n383\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.780\nAll those, right?\n\n384\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.300\nVI.\n\n385\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.620\nVI's like a hardcore editor, though.\n\n386\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.590\nVI's kind of hard.\n\n387\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.570\nSwap on, minus s, view the swap space.\n\n388\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.070\nAgain, you know, load the file,\nsee what's there.\n\n389\n00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.710\nSo, there's a lot of different ways\nwe can go in and work with Linux.\n\n390\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.480\nIt's just a high level overview of some\nof the common command line tools and\n\n391\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.990\nreferences we would use.\n\n392\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.570\nThere's obviously a lot of\ngraphical tools these days.\n\n393\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.620\nWe've taken a look at or will take\na look at in some upcoming episodes, and\n\n394\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.680\nat least talked about in some of\nthe other episodes up until now.\n\n395\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.850\nSome of the tools we'll go in at certain\npoints, mount some of the security tools.\n\n396\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.450\nWe'll take a look at autopsy, for\ninstance, both in Windows and in Linux.\n\n397\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.860\nI'll show you the Windows version,\nshow you the Linux version.\n\n398\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.720\nWe'll mount it through\ntake a look at that.\n\n399\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.650\nThere's a lot of different\nstuff you can do in there.\n\n400\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.940\nBut these are just common, every day,\n\n401\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.800\nordinary, Swiss Army Knife kind of tools\nthat you just pull out of your tool belt.\n\n402\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.970\nAnd just from a command line very\nquickly go in, query the system and\n\n403\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.660\nfind out a lot about.\n\n404\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.040\nThis is equivalent of going to the Windows\ncommand line and just launching three or\n\n405\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.450\nfour command line references.\n\n406\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.610\nHey, show me up time, show me DOS key,\nshow me history, whatever.\n\n407\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.870\nAnd you're gonna get all that stuff.\n\n408\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.520\nThis is kind of that hey list of 10 or\n20 different command line tools,\n\n409\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.980\nin Linux you would quickly throw\nout there, start profiling the box.\n\n410\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.170\nSo wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with those.\n\n411\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.620\nFrom an exam perspective, most likely\nif we're gonna see anything at all,\n\n412\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.045\nwe're gonna see tools\nalong the lines of these.\n\n413\n00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:37.425\nI would suggest maybe knowing\nwhat cat proc partitions does.\n\n414\n00:17:37.425 --> 00:17:40.655\nGive you a little demo or excuse me,\na little explanation of each one.\n\n415\n00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:42.885\nIf you're familiar with\nthe command line or\n\n416\n00:17:42.885 --> 00:17:46.732\nthe equivalent of what you would do to\nfind that information and what it does,\n\n417\n00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:50.202\nyou're probably well positioned to be\nsuccessful in this particular area.\n\n418\n00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.782\nSame thing with the Mac, for instance.\n\n419\n00:17:51.782 --> 00:17:54.702\nWe have have coming up here how\ndo we find the system version?\n\n420\n00:17:54.702 --> 00:17:58.322\nWe can identify the system version\nby viewing SystemVersion.plist file.\n\n421\n00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:01.577\nYou'll see the version of\nthe plist file is listed here.\n\n422\n00:18:01.577 --> 00:18:04.790\nSystem/Library/CoreServicesSystemVersion.-\nplist.\n\n423\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.770\nThat you will tell you\nthe equivalent of win ver,\n\n424\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:13.280\ntell you the equivalent of going in and\nprocing the build for Linux, same idea.\n\n425\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.790\nTimestamp, right, we can take a look at\nthe important information like creation,\n\n426\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.420\naccess, modification,\nall of the stuff we've been talking about.\n\n427\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.250\nSo we can use the usage command.\n\n428\n00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.932\nSo usage, stat, we can go in and\ntake a look at any of these.\n\n429\n00:18:25.932 --> 00:18:28.438\nWe could format, time format, etc, output.\n\n430\n00:18:28.438 --> 00:18:31.220\nAnd we could see the time stamps\non the files, so we can go in and\n\n431\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.640\nlook at a bunch of stuff there.\n\n432\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.080\nApplication bundles,\nwe talked about modules in Linux,\n\n433\n00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.860\ntalked about applications in Windows,\napplication bundles in the Mac world.\n\n434\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.630\nThese are going to store\nthe application data, or\n\n435\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.480\nbe the directories where we\nstore the application data.\n\n436\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.415\nJust like in Windows, where app data is\nhidden right in the profile, same idea.\n\n437\n00:18:49.415 --> 00:18:52.420\nSo these are hidden by default,\nthey're not seen normally.\n\n438\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.070\nWe hide them from the user,\nbut we can obviously go in and\n\n439\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.800\nlook at them if we know where to look.\n\n440\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.010\nSo in the Library, in the User Library\nfolder, users/username/Library,\n\n441\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.110\nwe can go in and we can take a look\nto see what's going on in there.\n\n442\n00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.300\nSo obviously, I want to look at\nexecutables, look at timestamps,\n\n443\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.250\nlook at the integrity of the files,\nmake sure no DLLs had been swapped out.\n\n444\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.000\nThese are common things we\ndo across different OS's\n\n445\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.880\nto validate what's going on in there.\n\n446\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.870\nWe record all the commands\nin the bash shell.\n\n447\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.860\nAgain bash is free file.\n\n448\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.810\nLinux and OS or Mac OS,\nessentially two sides of the same coin.\n\n449\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.610\nThey're both built on the same\ngeneral foundational thought process.\n\n450\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.360\nA lot of the file\nstructure is very similar.\n\n451\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.460\nA lot of the file names are very similar.\n\n452\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.860\nSo you'll find that.\n\n453\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.670\nWe can use the $tail command to be\nable to view the last commands in\n\n454\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.760\nthe bash history.\n\n455\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.480\nTail just means go to the end, right?\n\n456\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.450\nEssentially, just show me the last\nfive to ten commands, whatever it is.\n\n457\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.140\nSo, we could do that,\ndo that in Linux as well.\n\n458\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.910\nIt works essentially the same way.\n\n459\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.740\nWe can go in browser history,\ndownload history, bookmarks,\n\n460\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.900\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n461\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.380\nThings like history.plist,\ndownloads.plist, bookmarks.plist.\n\n462\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.750\nYou may be getting the general theme here,\nright?\n\n463\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.950\nEverything is a plist file in\nthe /Users/Library/Safari directory, and\n\n464\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.960\nthen obviously look for\nthe appropriate files there.\n\n465\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.550\nGot a MAC log and directory document\nI wanna show you real quick\n\n466\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.830\nthat'll show us where\na lot of this stuff lives.\n\n467\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.750\nAlso, just go in right here.\n\n468\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.310\nYep, just make this a little bit bigger.\n\n469\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.480\nJust give me one second.\n\n470\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.380\nJust blow that up maybe ten more percent.\n\n471\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.680\nLet's make that a little bigger,\na bit easier for you to see.\n\n472\n00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.940\nThere we go, it's probably a little nicer.\n\n473\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.400\nSo, again, one of these, we have one for\n\n474\n00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.610\nWindows, have one for Linux,\nnow we got one for the Mac.\n\n475\n00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.800\nSo, the MAC log files, where are they?\n\n476\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.470\nAgain, what are they?\n\n477\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.601\nYou see we have just a list here,\nabout a two-page list,\n\n478\n00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:36.420\napproximately a two-page\nlist with everything.\n\n479\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.030\nThis one's got a few more\nthan the Linux one does.\n\n480\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.539\nBut you'll see here you have\ncrashreporter, access_, error_,\n\n481\n00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:49.140\nlog.nmbd, ConnectionErrors for\niChat, all sorts of stuff.\n\n482\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.600\nAudit's one we often go look at.\n\n483\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.940\nThe Audit Log's a real important one,\nright?\n\n484\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.894\nInstall date of system and\nsoftware updates, so install.log.\n\n485\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.500\nWe've got a bunch of different ones here.\n\n486\n00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500\nThe Startup Items files,\n\n487\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.090\nthis is where we'll find things that are\nequivalent to the Start Menu in Windows.\n\n488\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.810\nSo wanna be looking there to see\nwhat's supposed to be running.\n\n489\n00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:10.660\nThe cron jobs in Mac OS X are in\nthe user/lib/cron/jobs subdirectory, so\n\n490\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.080\nwe'd be looking in there.\n\n491\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.850\nWe'd also look at etc/crontab.\n\n492\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:14.770\nVery similar to Linux, right?\n\n493\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.260\nYou would see basically the same\nstructure in Linux you see here.\n\n494\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.564\nWireless networks, Attached\niDevices if somebody is syncing for\n\n495\n00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:22.566\ninstance, we'd wanna know that.\n\n496\n00:21:22.566 --> 00:21:26.190\nWe'd see an acquisition log for\nevery one of those devices there.\n\n497\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.982\nThe nice thing here, social accounts,\nso we could see what's been set up.\n\n498\n00:21:29.982 --> 00:21:34.560\nYou know, Facebook and Whatsapp,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n499\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.160\nTrash is the equivalent of\nthe Recycle Bin, right?\n\n500\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.490\nSo the trash directory,\nwhat's been deleted, take a look there.\n\n501\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.130\nMozilla Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, they\nall have their subdirectories up under\n\n502\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.680\napplications so we can see what kinda\nweb browsers are running there.\n\n503\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.250\nAs I said, we may often find\nmore than one web browser by OS.\n\n504\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.270\nSo we wanna be aware of that.\n\n505\n00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.430\nSo there's a lot of stuff in here that\nwould be valuable on the MAC side that,\n\n506\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.910\nagain, could be useful.\n\n507\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.600\nIn the real world,\n\n508\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.830\nI would not spend a huge amount of\ntime reminding ourselves of and\n\n509\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:08.315\nlearning about two pages of log files from\nthe Mac OSX in order to take this exam.\n\n510\n00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:10.710\nI'd probably wanna know the highlights\nof some of the more common logs.\n\n511\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.580\nOnes that are very similar to\nLinux are probably a good bet.\n\n512\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.140\nYou have a couple outliers there that\nmay be valuable like the i devices,\n\n513\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.480\nthat may be a good one to know but\n\n514\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.110\nI wouldn't spend a lot of time\non things like crash reporter.\n\n515\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.910\nProbably not all that important for\n\n516\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.200\nan exam, but\nin the real world would be good to know.\n\n517\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.680\nThere are probably 30 logs or so\n\n518\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.660\nyou need to go after on a MAC box and\nknow where they are.\n\n519\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.414\nAgain, get a full chain of custody\ncompliant, forensics compliant,\n\n520\n00:22:34.414 --> 00:22:38.180\nevidence compliant,\na compliant version of this hard drive.\n\n521\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.964\nGet a DD image, or in other words,\na forensically sound image of this drive.\n\n522\n00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:43.052\nAll of these logs are gonna\nbe resident there.\n\n523\n00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:46.890\nJust go carve them off at your leisure\nas you start to investigate and\n\n524\n00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.750\nyou'll be able to find them.\n\n525\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.300\nThe other thing that may be of interest\nto you especially if you don't use Linux,\n\n526\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.940\nyou don't use Mac OSX very often.\n\n527\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.080\nIf you go out, get either an install and\ndo an install and\n\n528\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.140\njust kind of centrally image the machine.\n\n529\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.950\nPractice that aspect but then use that\nimage to start playing with this and\n\n530\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.100\nfind this stuff.\n\n531\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.820\nSometimes you can find these hard drives\nor virtual images for these OSs online,\n\n532\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.150\na lot of them you can pick up and use.\n\n533\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.800\nAnd you could get a copy, one that you\ncan start playing with and load and\n\n534\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.830\ngo in and you do a little on\nyour own investigation and\n\n535\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.590\nhelp you to better understand the file\nstructure and to see what's going on.\n\n536\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.780\nThe way you get good at this stuff\nis that you practice, right?\n\n537\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.450\nI mean, the obvious stuff we\nknow cuz we use everyday.\n\n538\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.610\nIt's the stuff we don't use all the time\nthat we've gotta practice on and don't be\n\n539\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.210\nafraid to go out and make yourself\na copy or two or borrow from somebody.\n\n540\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.990\nIf somebody has a Mac say hey,\ncan I image that?\n\n541\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.090\nCan I practice imaging it?\n\n542\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.282\nI'm not gonna damage it.\n\n543\n00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:42.240\nWe'll obviously scrub the data to make\nsure nothing personal shows up anywhere.\n\n544\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.640\nBut can I get a copy, an operational copy,\nsomewhere and work with it?\n\n545\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.910\nThat's how you get good at this stuff.\n\n546\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.970\nYou spend time just hands on.\n\n547\n00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.040\nWorking in the system.\n\n548\n00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.780\n&gt;&gt; You definitely have to be multifaceted,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n549\n00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.450\nObviously Windows is not\nthe only operating system that is\n\n550\n00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.720\nrolling around out there\nin the real world land.\n\n551\n00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.180\nSo, like Adam said,\n\n552\n00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.310\ngrab yourself a copy of Linux, throw it on\nan old laptop that you have laying around.\n\n553\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.650\nSee if you can't get your hand on a Mac,\ngo to the used stores and stuff like that.\n\n554\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.820\nYou don't have to buy a brand new\none just get your hands on it.\n\n555\n00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.390\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n556\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.540\nthat you can play around\nwith the operating system.\n\n557\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.660\nNow, if there's anything we learned\ntoday that's the most important thing,\n\n558\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.250\nit is that our computers\nhave demons inside of\n\n559\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.220\nthem and that-\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n560\n00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.895\n&gt;&gt; We now know that they're there and\nwhy they frustrate us to no end.\n\n561\n00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.310\n[LAUGH] Adam, it's been a long,\n\n562\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.560\nfun journey looking through the different\noperating system forensic techniques and\n\n563\n00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.230\nfiles and locations and tools that\nwe can use to do that said activity.\n\n564\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.600\nBut, it looks like we've come to the end\nof yet another great episode, and\n\n565\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.900\nanother little miniseries.\n\n566\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.050\nWe're done with-\n&gt;&gt; OS, operating system forensics.\n\n567\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Operating system forensics.\n\n568\n00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.030\nBut there is more to come, so\ndefinitely rejoin us again for\n\n569\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.970\nthe next great episode.\n\n570\n00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.810\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n571\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.550\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n572\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.405\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n573\n00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:55.601\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n574\n00:24:55.601 --> 00:25:01.533\n[MUSIC]\n\n575\n00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:04.971\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.288\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:08.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.730\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.174\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.174 --> 00:00:16.709\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:18.399\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:21.152\nin today's episode it is all\nabout the CHFI Version 9.\n\n10\n00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:24.590\nSo hopefully that's what you've tuned in,\nfor because that's what we're delivering.\n\n11\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.399\nAnd joining us in the studio when I mean\nus, is our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.085\nAdam, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.432\n&gt;&gt; Thank you sir, good, good.\n\n14\n00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:35.187\nAlways glad to be here talking about, in\nthis case, forensics, what we're gonna do,\n\n15\n00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:38.099\nhow we're gonna do it,\nwhere we're gonna find that information.\n\n16\n00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:40.086\nAnd be able to attribute it to one or\nmore individuals.\n\n17\n00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:44.625\nAnd that's really what\nwe're talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.645\nWe've been going through a lot of\ndifferent topics as we've been moving\n\n19\n00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.412\nthrough our discussions around\nthe CHFI Version 9 material.\n\n20\n00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:51.016\nAlways important to call out that version\nnumber as you did, because, well,\n\n21\n00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.130\nit's not Version 8 any longer.\n\n22\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.380\nAnd so it's important to know about that.\n\n23\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.086\nBut when we're talking about network\nforensics, and we're going to go in and\n\n24\n00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:01.016\nstart delving into that\nmaterial here in just a minute.\n\n25\n00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:04.612\nWe're thinking about the logic that's a\nlittle bit different I want to just point\n\n26\n00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:07.072\nthis out as we get started\nwith this set of discussions.\n\n27\n00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:10.816\nA little bit different approach than\nwe've been talking about up until now In\n\n28\n00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:13.532\noperating system forensics and\nhard drive forensics.\n\n29\n00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:17.012\nA lot of different errors are spoken about\nin prior shows and episodes up until this\n\n30\n00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:20.806\npoint if you've been watching us, kind of\nin sequential order, going through topics.\n\n31\n00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.088\nWe laid down the foundational information,\n\n32\n00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:27.233\ntalked extensively about the methodologies\ninvolved with incident response and\n\n33\n00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.186\nincident handling and\nforensic investigation overall.\n\n34\n00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:34.258\nSpoke about the importance of chain\nof custody, of awareness of evidence,\n\n35\n00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:35.986\nof the volatility of evidence.\n\n36\n00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:39.733\nYou know, a lot of the background material\nas well as a pretty extensive set of\n\n37\n00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.136\nconversations around the Federal\nrules of evidence The United States\n\n38\n00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:47.366\nbased laws that govern evidence handling\nand govern our interpretation of evidence.\n\n39\n00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:51.687\nAnd made it clear that although we\nunderstand that forensics response occurs\n\n40\n00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:55.011\nworldwide, that we are taking\nthat particular approach,\n\n41\n00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.265\ntalking about that material in this\nparticular way from the jurisdictional\n\n42\n00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:01.198\nstandpoint of the United States.\n\n43\n00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:05.399\nBecause of the fact that material is based\naround that set of laws that if you're\n\n44\n00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.734\nplanning for the exam,\nyou'd have to have evidence of those.\n\n45\n00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:11.706\nOr rather, pardon the pun,\nknowledge of that information.\n\n46\n00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.840\nAnd so we just wanna make sure\nyou're thinking about those things.\n\n47\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.771\nBut we're gonna switch our approach\na little bit for these conversations.\n\n48\n00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:22.191\nNetwork forensics is important, something\nwe will often be called on to do as\n\n49\n00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:26.955\nforensic investigators, as incident\nresponders, as security professionals.\n\n50\n00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:31.038\nBut it may not occur in the same way,\nwith the same thought process, and\n\n51\n00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:35.213\nfrom the same perspective that\ngeneral forensics investigation does.\n\n52\n00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:39.576\nWe're not going to, for instance, have\none machine necessarily that we're gonna\n\n53\n00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.779\ntarget and do a deep thorough\ninspection and examination of.\n\n54\n00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.513\nWe're not gonna be gathering information\nfrom a single machine, both volatile and\n\n55\n00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:48.520\nnon-volatile.\n\n56\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.101\nWe're not gonna be looking at necessarily\njust one set of data points from one point\n\n57\n00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:54.550\nof view or vantage point.\n\n58\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.833\nBut rather, with network forensics,\n\n59\n00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.510\nwe're looking at information as\nit transits across the wire.\n\n60\n00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.364\nLike data can exist in three states,\ntraditionally.\n\n61\n00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:08.234\nData at rest, in storage if you will,\nwhether it's local or remote, cloud-based,\n\n62\n00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:09.381\nwhatever it may be.\n\n63\n00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.905\nBut data that's in storage in some form.\n\n64\n00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:15.090\nData in use, application-based data,\nat the end point,\n\n65\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.244\nsomebody reading email, somebody\nwriting something into a Word document.\n\n66\n00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:24.116\nSomebody saving something from an\napplication to a local hard drive is data\n\n67\n00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:24.668\nin use.\n\n68\n00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:27.509\nAnd then data on the wire,\nwhat we call data in transit.\n\n69\n00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:32.385\nData moving back and forth, the bits and\nbytes of ones and zeros as they transit or\n\n70\n00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:35.754\nstream through from one endpoint\nover a network to one or\n\n71\n00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:39.002\nmore endpoints ultimately\nsomewhere down the line.\n\n72\n00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.278\nAnd when we look at data that's\nbeing captured along the way,\n\n73\n00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:44.739\nwe're looking at live\ndata that is volatile.\n\n74\n00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.108\nAnd for the most part, when we're\nlooking at that data, it is ephemeral,\n\n75\n00:03:48.108 --> 00:03:49.024\nit will come and go.\n\n76\n00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:50.754\nIf we don't capture it, it can disappear.\n\n77\n00:03:50.754 --> 00:03:54.645\nBut there may also be log evidence\nthat we're looking at which is static,\n\n78\n00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:56.864\nwhich would not be considered volatile.\n\n79\n00:03:56.864 --> 00:04:00.327\nSo, we do have a mixture of data types\nwhen we're dealing with network forensics,\n\n80\n00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:03.803\nwant to first of all establish that, make\nsure we're comfortable with that idea.\n\n81\n00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:08.510\nSecond of all, we do wanna understand\nthat while we're primarily focusing at\n\n82\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.502\nleast with the transition of data\nin this discussion on live data,\n\n83\n00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:16.353\ndata that is moving across the wire and\ntherefore is volatile and\n\n84\n00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:20.673\nwill be captured with some sort of\nnetwork monitor or sniffer program.\n\n85\n00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:24.634\nThere is also data in storage that we\nwill look at and data in use in theory.\n\n86\n00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:26.940\nAnd so\nwe're covering the life cycle of data.\n\n87\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.087\nAnd we're looking at data from vantage\npoints, plural, that involve logging,\n\n88\n00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:34.514\ninvolve the application or\napplications that may be generating and\n\n89\n00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:37.599\nusing the data and\ncertainly the transmission of that data.\n\n90\n00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.841\nSo we are looking holistically across\nthe entire spectrum of data when we think\n\n91\n00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:43.330\nabout network forensics.\n\n92\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.814\nAnd people sometimes miss this or\nmisrepresent this,\n\n93\n00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:49.059\nthink, it's just the data in\ntransit it's just data on the wire.\n\n94\n00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.905\nIt's the bits that we're capturing,\nthat we have to focus on.\n\n95\n00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.967\nAnd that is very important, and\nwe do certainly do a lot of that,\n\n96\n00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:57.747\nbut not exclusively, and not only.\n\n97\n00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.879\nAnd we wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that as we get started.\n\n98\n00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.421\nWe also wanna think about the fact\nthat we are gonna be looking for\n\n99\n00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.992\na variety of different\ntypes of information.\n\n100\n00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:11.410\nWe are gonna look at, as we said, raw data\ncaptures, or we're gonna be looking at\n\n101\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.523\nlogged information that may occur or\nhave occurred on one or more machines.\n\n102\n00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:19.212\nAnd its going to be extra important,\nsuper duper critical as we say,\n\n103\n00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:23.292\nand that is a formal technical term by\nthe way, super duper you can use that.\n\n104\n00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:26.470\nIf you CHFI you can use\nthe word super duper.\n\n105\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.169\n&gt;&gt; You can see that in a report?\n\n106\n00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.272\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can, that and\n\n107\n00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:31.052\nokie dokie both of those do.\n\n108\n00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:36.295\nYou are given usage rights and license to\nuse those terms when you are certified.\n\n109\n00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:39.774\nBut when we think about the data that\nwe're looking at it's gonna be very\n\n110\n00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:40.459\nimportant for\n\n111\n00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.130\nus to understand that we have to be\ncapturing not just the data as it streams.\n\n112\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.492\nAnd not just the data from\none endpoint to another.\n\n113\n00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:51.290\nBut we have to cross-reference and\ncorrelate this data coming from one\n\n114\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.772\nmachine and\nlook at all the points it touches.\n\n115\n00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:56.092\nAnd look at where it winds up transiting,\n\n116\n00:05:56.092 --> 00:06:00.485\nas well as where it ultimately ends up\nalong the path, in other words, right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.972\nAnd this is one of those skills that\ninvestigators have to bring to the table,\n\n118\n00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:05.485\nreally develop and understand.\n\n119\n00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.193\nYou've gotta visualize the data path.\n\n120\n00:06:07.193 --> 00:06:11.651\nYou've gotta visualize who and what was\ninvolved in that sending and receiving,\n\n121\n00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:15.988\nthat transmission and exchange of data\nas a CHFI, as a forensic investigator.\n\n122\n00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:20.112\nAnd as a result we then have to then be\nable to document not just the path, but\n\n123\n00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:23.060\nthen reach out and\ninvestigate those midway points,\n\n124\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.172\nthose transit points as we move data.\n\n125\n00:06:25.172 --> 00:06:29.338\nBecause there may be documentary evidence\nin a router that we have to look at from\n\n126\n00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:31.711\na log perspective and\naccess control lists.\n\n127\n00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:33.370\nWho knows what that may be?\n\n128\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.493\nThere may be evidence on\nthe end point that we targeted,\n\n129\n00:06:36.493 --> 00:06:40.349\nthat we sent the data to, that will\nvalidate or somehow shed light and\n\n130\n00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.089\nilluminate for us, this sense of the data,\nthe value of it, the disposition of it.\n\n131\n00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.747\nWhat it was used for, how it was used, was\nit modified, has the integrity mechanism\n\n132\n00:06:49.747 --> 00:06:53.438\nwe've used to validate the data\nfrom the sending point held true?\n\n133\n00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:57.260\nAnd do we see the data still has integrity\nat the endpoint where it winds up?\n\n134\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.568\nThese are questions we\nwould have to ask and\n\n135\n00:06:59.568 --> 00:07:02.656\nas an investigator we would\nhave to provide answers for.\n\n136\n00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:06.930\nAs a security professional it's incumbent\non us to understand the information as it\n\n137\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.989\nmoves through our systems at all times.\n\n138\n00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:10.641\nThe state and\nthe value of that information.\n\n139\n00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:14.488\nConfidentialities, we'll talk\nabout integrity availability.\n\n140\n00:07:14.488 --> 00:07:15.983\nAll these things are important.\n\n141\n00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:20.105\nNo less important to the forensic\ninvestigator, in fact, more important.\n\n142\n00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:24.098\nBecause we have to authoritatively\nexplain and tell that story and\n\n143\n00:07:24.098 --> 00:07:29.319\ndocument that both in writing and with\nthe supplementary artifact-based evidence.\n\n144\n00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.520\nAll the log captures and\n\n145\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.717\nthe detail that we provide around\nthe evidence that we gather.\n\n146\n00:07:33.717 --> 00:07:34.335\nWe have to do so\n\n147\n00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:37.701\nin a forensically sound manner as we've\ndiscussed many many times with you.\n\n148\n00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:41.623\nWe'll continue to discuss as we move\nthrough the rest of the material.\n\n149\n00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:45.488\nAnd we have to then, in theory,\nif required to, be able to step up and\n\n150\n00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:50.172\nnot only produce that documentation, but\nvalidate that it is indeed legitimate.\n\n151\n00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:54.285\nAnd then perhaps, if necessary,\nshow up in court or at a trial, or\n\n152\n00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:57.380\nwhatever that formal or\ninformal process may be.\n\n153\n00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.768\nA hearing, a trial of some kind, a bench\ntrial, a jury trial, whatever it is And\n\n154\n00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:05.338\nwe may be called to investigate,\nas well as to actually testify.\n\n155\n00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:10.348\nAnd so we do have to understand that our\nrole as a CHFI as a forensic investigator,\n\n156\n00:08:10.348 --> 00:08:14.993\nis multifaceted, and will take on\nvery many additional responsibilities\n\n157\n00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:18.770\nalong the way throughout the life\ncycle of this discussion.\n\n158\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.887\nWe have to be prepared for that.\n\n159\n00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:22.713\nAnd as we look into or\nstart to look into network forensics,\n\n160\n00:08:22.713 --> 00:08:26.150\nit's especially important for\nus to pause and think about that.\n\n161\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.384\nBecause network forensics is gonna blend\ntogether a lot of these other areas,\n\n162\n00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.834\neven though it doesn't sound\non the surface like it would.\n\n163\n00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:36.600\nAnd we have to be prepared to use those\nskills to examine individual endpoints.\n\n164\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.073\nHard drive forensics,\napplication base forensics, web forensics,\n\n165\n00:08:41.073 --> 00:08:42.347\nmobile forensics.\n\n166\n00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:45.565\nThere's a lot additional areas that\nwe either have talked about or\n\n167\n00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:49.242\nwill talk about as we move through\nthe remainder of our discussions that will\n\n168\n00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:52.172\nbe brought back into the network\nforensics conversation and\n\n169\n00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:54.250\nare sitting there just under the surface.\n\n170\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.976\nAs we peel back those layers\nlooking at traffic flows,\n\n171\n00:08:56.976 --> 00:09:00.295\nwe have to begin to see where\ntraffic diverges, where it winds up,\n\n172\n00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:02.745\nhow it's used, and\nwhat that story looks like.\n\n173\n00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:05.841\nIt is actually a very\ninteresting conversation, and\n\n174\n00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:11.070\none that is very rich and multifaceted, it\nhas a lot of variables associated with it.\n\n175\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.168\nWe don't often stop and think about it.\n\n176\n00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:15.508\nPeople just say, well network forensics,\nthat's just router stuff, right?\n\n177\n00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:18.460\nWe're capturing packets,\nhow hard could that be?\n\n178\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.660\nYou turn on a packet capture program,\nyou set a filter,\n\n179\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.436\nyou get a bunch of stuff, you analyze it,\nyou see the packets, you write a report.\n\n180\n00:09:26.436 --> 00:09:27.750\nHow tough could that be?\n\n181\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.953\nWell, that part's not tough,\nrealistically not very tough, anyway.\n\n182\n00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:33.925\nBut it's all the other stuff that goes\nwith it on the transmission path that\n\n183\n00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:36.614\nactually makes it a little bit more\nchallenging than you may think of\n\n184\n00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:37.290\non the service.\n\n185\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.650\nSo, just something to\nconsider as we get started.\n\n186\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.599\nSo the capturing, recording,\nand analysis in network events,\n\n187\n00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:45.547\nin order to be able to discover\nthe source of security incidents,\n\n188\n00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:47.915\nis how we would formally\ndefine network forensics.\n\n189\n00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:49.546\nJust making you think about that.\n\n190\n00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.840\nWe've talked about the fact that we\ncan reveal quite a bit of information.\n\n191\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.589\nAs you've heard me talk about over\nthe last few minutes, traces and evidence.\n\n192\n00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:58.980\nPotentially the methodology or\nthe what we call attack vector,\n\n193\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.400\nthe method that was used by the attacker.\n\n194\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.110\nOr by the bad actor,\nsometimes called a threat source,\n\n195\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.170\nto be able to execute the attack,\nif indeed, there was an attack.\n\n196\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.296\nRemember, a lot of times,\nwe're called to investigate but\n\n197\n00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:14.109\nwe have to establish whether or\nnot authoritatively there was an attack.\n\n198\n00:10:14.109 --> 00:10:16.496\nMaybe there was but\nmaybe there wasn't, right?\n\n199\n00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:19.133\nAnd we kinda walk into this\nconversation with the assumption,\n\n200\n00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:22.172\nwell we're doing digital forensics,\nwe're doing instant response,\n\n201\n00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:23.780\nthere must of been an attack, right?\n\n202\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.786\nWhy would you talk about\nit if there wasn't one?\n\n203\n00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:28.060\nWhy would you investigate\nif there wasn't one?\n\n204\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.550\nWell a lot of times we're not\nsure what’s happened right.\n\n205\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.520\nWe’re called out by somebody or\na group of somebodies or\n\n206\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.900\na representative of a group of somebodies\nin a company because they fear, they feel,\n\n207\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.060\nthey think that something has gone wrong.\n\n208\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.260\nBut they don't have the authoritative\nanswer and they don't have the skills and\n\n209\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.160\nthe capabilities to make an authoritative\njudgement on the spot, right.\n\n210\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.530\nLooks like something, acts like something,\nbut we don't know for\n\n211\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.650\nsure that it's something.\n\n212\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.350\nAnd we as investigators are often\ncalled to make that determination.\n\n213\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.470\nSo we have to walk into the everyone of\nthose engagements with the mindset that\n\n214\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.710\nit's very possible that\nsomething has indeed happened.\n\n215\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.230\nBut it's also equally possible that what\nhas happened has either misrepresented\n\n216\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.380\nitself, or is being misinterpreted by\nthose early people that have seen that or\n\n217\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.840\nearly responders.\n\n218\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.480\nAnd we're gonna to be asked to\nunwind that and, authoritatively,\n\n219\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.420\nto the best of our ability,\ntell that definitive story.\n\n220\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.800\nAnd that definitive story, by the way, may\nwind up being that there was no incident.\n\n221\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.780\nThat we misinterpreted what happened.\n\n222\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.420\nThat yes, legitimately seems\nlike something went wrong.\n\n223\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.880\nBut we can attribute that\nto a fault in the program,\n\n224\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.880\nwe can attribute that to\nsome sort of other issue.\n\n225\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.450\nAnd it was not Jo hacking the server.\n\n226\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.800\nIt was that we had a piece of software\nthat caused some sort of program fault and\n\n227\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.670\nyou, as a result, just caused\nthe system to act erratically or\n\n228\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.290\nto behave in an incorrect manner.\n\n229\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.970\nBut then, of course, we're able to\nestablish it by fixing that problem,\n\n230\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.970\nwe now have a system that is back in line.\n\n231\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.830\nOur configuration baseline has been\nreapplied, everything seems to be normal.\n\n232\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.440\nWe can, in other words, say definitively\nthat at that point in time,\n\n233\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.500\nwhat we thought was happening\nwas indeed something different.\n\n234\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.630\nWe can prove that.\n\n235\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.100\nWhether something will happen in\nthe future or not, nobody can say, right.\n\n236\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.560\nAnd so this is about a moment in\ntime representation of data and\n\n237\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.650\na moment in time understanding in\nthe interpretation of that data,\n\n238\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.570\nwhenever we do any of these activities.\n\n239\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.710\nBut keep in mind that as\nwe get called to respond,\n\n240\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.820\na lot of times people have thoughts\nabout what may have occurred.\n\n241\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.090\nBut if they were definitive and\nthey understood what happened,\n\n242\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.580\nthey wouldn't need us in the first place,\nright?\n\n243\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.290\nI mean,\nif you think about the logic of that.\n\n244\n00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.397\nIf they can authoritatively tell you, they\nbeing the customer, whoever is asking you\n\n245\n00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:31.492\nto respond, they can authoritatively\ntell you that they know for\n\n246\n00:12:31.492 --> 00:12:34.375\nsure that this happened and\nhere's why, then why am I here?\n\n247\n00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.326\nI mean, that's the conversation I\ndo have sometimes with customers in\n\n248\n00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:38.270\nthe real world.\n\n249\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.862\nIf you're so\nsure that this thing happened and\n\n250\n00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:43.724\nthis person's responsible,\nwhy did you call me?\n\n251\n00:12:43.724 --> 00:12:47.960\n&gt;&gt; So we can just become very\nmuch a verification entity.\n\n252\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.590\nWell you know sometimes to that\nend with that conversation.\n\n253\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.220\nSo, the response from\nthe customers sometimes is\n\n254\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.360\nwe need the formal quote on quote\nofficial skills you possess.\n\n255\n00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.110\nWe need the official chain of custody,\n\n256\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.960\nstamp of approval formal\nmethodological approach to investigate\n\n257\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.410\nto prove what we already know\ncuz we caught them red handed.\n\n258\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.600\nWe just don't know how to\npresent that evidence,\n\n259\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.700\npackaged up in a way that will then\nallow us to prosecute a case or\n\n260\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.370\nto formally fire this person,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n261\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.100\nThe burden of proof to fire somebody\nis a lot less than bringing them to\n\n262\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.480\ntrial obviously, but\n\n263\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.260\nultimately they may be calling you in\nto validate what they already know.\n\n264\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.790\nJust from a procedure perspective, right?\n\n265\n00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.580\nTo formally document that, and\n\n266\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.800\nI get that a lot, but I want to be\nclear with the customer up front.\n\n267\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.820\nHey, what's the reason you've ask somebody\nwith this kind of skill set to show up and\n\n268\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.880\ndo a job, because I want to know\nwhat the expectation is, right?\n\n269\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.300\nIt's about requirements gathering.\n\n270\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.740\nWe often talk about understanding\nthe requirements or\n\n271\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.270\nneeds of the party that's engaging us.\n\n272\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.280\nNo different here, right?\n\n273\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.100\nEyes wide open as we say.\n\n274\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.570\nCaveat emptor, buyer beware,\nright, so it's important.\n\n275\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.360\nThat's Latin, by the way, in case you were\nnot [LAUGH] familiar with that, right?\n\n276\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.640\nBut very important for you to understand\nthat as an investigator, as a security\n\n277\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.180\nprofessional, we have a unique set of\nskills, and we you have to understand what\n\n278\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.570\nthe purpose that those skills are being\npushed into the field than being used is.\n\n279\n00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.820\nNot that I want to say no to somebody,\nbut there have been times when people\n\n280\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.360\nhave asked me to do things that,\nnumber one, makes absolutely no sense and\n\n281\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.180\nnumber two while it's certainly never been\nunethical or illegal, nobody's ever asked\n\n282\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.900\nme to hack into a system on purpose to\ndo something that would violate a law.\n\n283\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.070\nAnd if they did, I would clearly say no.\n\n284\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.280\nBut there have been times where there's\nbeen a misunderstanding between\n\n285\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.480\nwhat the customer expects can happen and\nwhat is possible or\n\n286\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.710\nlegitimate given the circumstances.\n\n287\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.600\nAnd I think it's very important just as\na real world aside as sometimes I try to\n\n288\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.670\nshare with you that you understand going\ninto these investigative processes and\n\n289\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.360\nthese opportunities to\nflex your muscles and\n\n290\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.760\nuse your skills that you're in control.\n\n291\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.320\nYou've gotta say to the customer this is\nwhat we can do, this is the methodology,\n\n292\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.100\nthese are the expectations and\nthis is what I'm prepared to do for you.\n\n293\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.010\nWill that work?\n\n294\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.860\nAnd lets reach an agreement\nbecause if that doesn't work for\n\n295\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.200\nyou if you're looking for a different\noutcome, then perhaps this is not\n\n296\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.760\nthe right relationship and\nI may not be the right person or the right\n\n297\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.060\nspecific set of skills and, therefore,\nthe outcome that you're looking for.\n\n298\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.390\nAnd maybe you need to\ngo a different route.\n\n299\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.560\nMaybe there are other\npeople that can do this.\n\n300\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.869\nI've been put in situations\nin the past where.\n\n301\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.630\nCustomers have engaged in their own\ninvestigative processes internally with\n\n302\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.830\ntheir own teams.\n\n303\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.420\nThey've reached a set of conclusions.\n\n304\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.730\nThey're pretty confident about those\nconclusions and they're asking me to come\n\n305\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.980\nin and rubber stamp those conclusions\nwithout giving me access to the data,\n\n306\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.940\nwithout giving me access to the systems.\n\n307\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.670\nWithout in other words, allowing me to\ncarry out my own counter investigation to\n\n308\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.560\nvalidate and hopefully prove\nwhat they've already found.\n\n309\n00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.990\nI'm not looking to disapprove\ntheir assertions, but\n\n310\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.910\nI'm also not gonna put my name on\nsomething just because you're telling\n\n311\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.940\nme that your people feel this is the case.\n\n312\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.900\nI'm gonna have to validate that or\nI'm not going to be associated with it.\n\n313\n00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.266\nAnd there have been some times over the\nyears where that has not been amenable to\n\n314\n00:15:58.266 --> 00:15:58.929\nthe customer.\n\n315\n00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:01.862\nTheir position has been,\nhey our people know what they're doing,\n\n316\n00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:04.385\neverything is good,\nall we need you to do is essentially,\n\n317\n00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:07.799\njust rubber stamp that and validate it so\nwe can present it to law enforcement.\n\n318\n00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:11.036\nAnd I've said, no, that's not what I'm\ngonna do, because that's not appropriate.\n\n319\n00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:15.212\nIt's not how you work in this industry and\nI would be remiss in my responsibilities\n\n320\n00:16:15.212 --> 00:16:18.540\nthat I would not be acting with\ndue care and due diligence.\n\n321\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.080\nIf I put my name on a report to validate\nyour internal assumptions without having\n\n322\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.000\naccess to the data and being able\nto make sure the data is correct,\n\n323\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.710\nthe chain of custody was maintained.\n\n324\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.530\nBut all the things we talk about,\nhave been validated.\n\n325\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.140\nRemember, it's your reputation\nthat you're talking about,\n\n326\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.650\nthat I'm talking about here.\n\n327\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.660\nYou don't get a second chance to rebuild\nthat reputation and make a good one.\n\n328\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.700\nYou only get one chance at that, if you\ndecide you wanna put your credentials and\n\n329\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.850\nyour name on the line for somebody.\n\n330\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.080\nAnd whether on purpose or by accident,\n\n331\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.270\nthey have mislead you as to what they\nare doing, that's your responsibility.\n\n332\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.376\nYou've made a bad choice, and you may\nnot be able to recover from that easily.\n\n333\n00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:56.600\nSo you really have to be skeptical when\nyou deal with customers not because\n\n334\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.780\nthey lie, want to be clear,\nI don't think the customers do on purpose.\n\n335\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.453\nI don't think anybody does on purpose.\n\n336\n00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:05.303\nBut I think it's easy for\nthem to get caught up in the moment and\n\n337\n00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:08.920\nto not represent the information\nin an accurate way.\n\n338\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.570\nNot because of the fact that they're\npurposely looking to deceive you, but\n\n339\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.290\nbecause their vision of what's\nhappened is clouding their judgment.\n\n340\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.950\nAnd they're telling you a story\nthat makes sense to them.\n\n341\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.800\nBut the question is,\ndoes it make sense to you?\n\n342\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.660\nAnd if it doesn't make sense to you,\nwhy not?\n\n343\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.180\nAnd if it does, let's talk about\nhow you validate that, right?\n\n344\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.735\nAnd that's what our forensics\ninvestigative methodology is all about.\n\n345\n00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:31.345\nLet's validate that story.\n\n346\n00:17:31.345 --> 00:17:34.695\nLet's prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the appropriate skills, tools,\n\n347\n00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:39.225\nresources, process, procedure and\ndocumentary evidence that,\n\n348\n00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.315\nthat story indeed what it is.\n\n349\n00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:43.455\nThen I will be happy to put\nmy name on that report.\n\n350\n00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:44.215\nNo problem.\n\n351\n00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:45.995\nBut if I can't do those things,\n\n352\n00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:48.955\nI'm really not all that excited about\nwanting to be a part of what you're doing\n\n353\n00:17:48.955 --> 00:17:53.120\nbecause chances are good that it's not\ngonna wind up the way you think it will.\n\n354\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.030\nAnd I don't necessarily want to be a part\nof that because I don't want my reputation\n\n355\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.540\nto become something that people feel\n\n356\n00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.310\nmay not accurately represent\nthe right way of doing something.\n\n357\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.690\nIt's a very subtle, but\nincredibly important distinction,\n\n358\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.410\nabout what we do in this particular\nbranch of information security.\n\n359\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.710\nBecause really it is about how honest\n\n360\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.040\nyou are in the sense of how honestly you\napproach and pursue the methodology, and\n\n361\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.820\nif you're transparent about that, people\ntrust you and understand you do good work.\n\n362\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.979\nIf you're not, people look at you and\nsay, yeah, he signed that but\n\n363\n00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:25.790\nwe have no idea what that really means.\n\n364\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.414\nWe have to go redo all of that\nbecause chances are good,\n\n365\n00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:29.843\nbased on prior information,\n\n366\n00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:33.650\nprior experience, that signature\nprobably doesn't mean all that much.\n\n367\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.670\nAnd if you really think about it,\n\n368\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.910\nyou don't really get a second\nchance to make people trust you,\n\n369\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.450\nis what I'm suggesting, so\njust keep that in mind.\n\n370\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.700\nSo when we talk about this, we're thinking\nabout where we do this investigation.\n\n371\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.730\nObviously internal versus external is\nalways one of those considerations.\n\n372\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.390\nThere are internal bad actors\nthat have access to our networks.\n\n373\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.540\nUsually, much less restriction on\ntheir ability to see traffic than\n\n374\n00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.020\nsomebody who is external.\n\n375\n00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.250\nAn external bad actor, assuming our\nnetwork defenses are set up properly,\n\n376\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.230\nwould be difficult is an understatement.\n\n377\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.060\nIt would be almost impossible for\n\n378\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.380\nthe average external bad actor to\ngain entry to an internal secure LAN.\n\n379\n00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.530\nIf we've set up or firewalls,\nour IDSs our IPSs,\n\n380\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.300\nour monitoring, our defense\nin-depth architecture properly.\n\n381\n00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.870\nTalked a lot about enterprise security\narchitecture in different episodes.\n\n382\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.650\nTalked about the value\nof defense in-depth.\n\n383\n00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.607\nOverlapping, mutually reinforcing\nlayers of controls or\n\n384\n00:19:28.607 --> 00:19:30.802\ncounter measures that back one another up.\n\n385\n00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:34.771\nAnd create this opportunity for\nus to super protect and\n\n386\n00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:39.516\nreally overlay a protection grid\naround our security enclaves or\n\n387\n00:19:39.516 --> 00:19:44.500\ninformation security enclaves\nthat have to be well protected.\n\n388\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.320\nAnd these boundaries have to\nbe demarcated and monitored.\n\n389\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.035\nAnd assuming we have all that in place,\nand that's basically security 101, right?\n\n390\n00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:55.949\nOne of the very first things we talk about\nand think about doing as we talk about\n\n391\n00:19:55.949 --> 00:19:59.743\nsecurity, is how we understand that\nmethodology, how we apply that, and\n\n392\n00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:04.141\nhow we build out those layers successively\nto delay, deter, and ultimately defend,\n\n393\n00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.620\nwe call it triple D, right?\n\n394\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.384\nAnd so those things are important.\n\n395\n00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:09.480\nAnd if we've done all those things,\n\n396\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.760\nthe external bad actors should be sitting\nbeyond the chasm, somewhere out there.\n\n397\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.340\nAnd we can identify where they\nare coming from through one or more\n\n398\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.860\ncommonly monitored access points, simply\nthrough DMZs or remote access gateways.\n\n399\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.370\nWe should be able to put a lot of\nmonitoring capabilities on those portals\n\n400\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.420\nand definitively say and\nunderstand whats happening there.\n\n401\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.130\nAnd as a result,\nwe should be able to monitor inflow,\n\n402\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.650\ningress traffic as opposed to egress,\noutbound traffic.\n\n403\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.070\nAnd we should be able to tell definitively\nwhen those bad actors are attempting\n\n404\n00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.030\nto get into and break through our defense.\n\n405\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.430\nSo external bad actors,\nit's important to know about them.\n\n406\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.340\nWe do the internal versus external\ncommunication comparison.\n\n407\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.720\nWe can clearly articulate and\n\n408\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.820\ndefine beyond any reasonable doubt\nwhat those boundaries should be.\n\n409\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.740\nBut we also have real-time monitoring\nversus postmortem monitoring as another\n\n410\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.685\napproach or thought process here.\n\n411\n00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:02.150\nReal-time monitoring speaks for\nitself, hopefully.\n\n412\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.340\nIf not real-time, almost real-time,\nwe call near real-time data steams.\n\n413\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.160\nI'd be thinking about SEM Solutions,\nfor instance, in this category,\n\n414\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.255\nthinking about IDS, IPS,\nwe call commonly IDPS today.\n\n415\n00:21:14.255 --> 00:21:17.795\nSystems where we're aggregating traffic,\nmoving it through firewalls,\n\n416\n00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:21.015\nthrough proxies,\nthrough IDPS systems in real-time.\n\n417\n00:21:21.015 --> 00:21:23.355\nExamining those packets as they come and\ngo and\n\n418\n00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:25.165\nunderstanding what's happening with them.\n\n419\n00:21:25.165 --> 00:21:30.585\nData visualization, business intelligence\nstacks, applied to these traffic flows.\n\n420\n00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:34.425\nThis is the future quote unquote that's\nalready here that we've been looking at\n\n421\n00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:37.580\nfor the last five to seven years and\ncontinue to see the growth of,\n\n422\n00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.110\nespecially around the capabilities in\ncloud and virtualization platforms today.\n\n423\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.740\nThings like that.\n\n424\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.646\nSo real-time monitoring versus postmortem.\n\n425\n00:21:45.646 --> 00:21:50.170\nPostmortem, historically,\nhas always really meant after the fact.\n\n426\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.152\nWe often hear it referred to as a PIR,\n\n427\n00:21:52.152 --> 00:21:56.770\npost implementation review in\nproject management and SDLC speak.\n\n428\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.800\nWe may hear it referred to\nas a lessons learned event.\n\n429\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.380\nThere's different names we give\nit based on the methodology.\n\n430\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.440\nAt the end of the day they all\nfall under the same bucket.\n\n431\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.450\nWhat they mean is,\ninstead of dynamic real time, or\n\n432\n00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.200\nnear real time monitoring of data to\nglean knowledge and understanding,\n\n433\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.140\nwe look at data after the fact, reactively\nas opposed to proactively in real time.\n\n434\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.310\nAnd we try to understand what went on so\nthat we can then learn, certainly,\n\n435\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.030\nfrom what happened.\n\n436\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.980\nPerhaps glean root cause capabilities,\nand knowledge.\n\n437\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.960\nMake some decisions about things going\nforward that will hopefully modify\n\n438\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.880\nthat behavior.\n\n439\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.300\nBut we have to talk about real time versus\npostmortem as well as internal versus\n\n440\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.550\nthe external bad actors, and\nthinking about those things.\n\n441\n00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.640\nAnd when we think about monitoring in\nthe network forensics base from those\n\n442\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.600\nperspectives, it becomes\na little bit easier for\n\n443\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.750\nus to have a sense of\nhow these things work.\n\n444\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.241\nMost common attacks that\nare launched against networks,\n\n445\n00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.595\nand there are many, many of them.\n\n446\n00:22:48.595 --> 00:22:50.836\nThere's always a list that somebody has,\n\n447\n00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:55.380\nalways a set of assumptions or thought\nprocesses somebody can throw out for you.\n\n448\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.330\nAnd we have one, certainly, and\nwe've talked a lot about these.\n\n449\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.830\nNot authoritative in the sense\nthat it's not complete.\n\n450\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.590\nBut certainly it gives you\na starting point and a guide here.\n\n451\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.923\nThings like eavesdropping and\ndata modification, IP address spoofing,\n\n452\n00:23:07.923 --> 00:23:11.922\nmasquerading, session hijacking,\nwe call them man in the middle.\n\n453\n00:23:11.922 --> 00:23:17.405\nAll these kinds of attacks would happen\nand be part of this categorization.\n\n454\n00:23:17.405 --> 00:23:21.880\nDenial of service, what we call DoS,\nDDoS, distribute denial of service,\n\n455\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.850\npacket sniffing, enumeration,\nbuffer overflows, email injection and\n\n456\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.150\nemail attacks, I think phishing and\nthings like that.\n\n457\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.290\nMalware, password-based attacks.\n\n458\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.370\nThe list really centers around the idea of\nhow we move information between systems\n\n459\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.150\nand how we manipulate\ninformation along the way.\n\n460\n00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:43.820\nBlind spoofing, double blind spoofing, all\nthese kind of categories of attacks we may\n\n461\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.332\nhave knowledge of, may have heard of, may\nhave talked about, would be on this list.\n\n462\n00:23:47.332 --> 00:23:49.025\nAnother movie I just\nthought about that I saw.\n\n463\n00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:51.260\nI didn't see it on the trip but\nI saw it afterwards.\n\n464\n00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.200\nBut I wanted to see it for a while.\n\n465\n00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.940\nYou and I actually talked about it,\nI think.\n\n466\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.230\nThe Great Wall.\n\n467\n00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So Matt Damon, right?\n\n468\n00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:58.343\n&gt;&gt; It was pretty good.\n\n469\n00:23:58.343 --> 00:23:59.778\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it was good.\nBut it actually kind of plays into our\n\n470\n00:23:59.778 --> 00:24:01.801\nconversation here because if\nyou haven't seen the movie,\n\n471\n00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:03.720\nit obviously doesn't make\na lot of sense to you.\n\n472\n00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.705\nHave you seen it?\n&gt;&gt; I have not found a chance.\n\n473\n00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:07.682\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so then it won't make sense\nto you either but when you do see it,\n\n474\n00:24:07.682 --> 00:24:10.960\nif you do get a chance to see it The idea\nis, you know obviously the Great Wall in\n\n475\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.980\nChina historically back during\nperiod it would've been built.\n\n476\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.550\nWhat was it built for, why are they\ndefending it, that kind of thing.\n\n477\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.160\nIt centers around that without\nruining the movie for you-\n\n478\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.340\n&gt;&gt; It's the Mongolian invasion\n\n479\n00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.330\nof China right?\n\n480\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, in that time period but it's\nnot what you would think traditionally,\n\n481\n00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.990\nin other words yes, we think of and then\nhistorically have been told hey the wall\n\n482\n00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:32.990\nwas built by successive Chinese Emperors\nto essentially keep out the Mongol hordes.\n\n483\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.330\nTo defend the border at least at the time,\nthe border of China, and\n\n484\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:42.180\nto keep out invading parties,\ncountries, whatever the case may be.\n\n485\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.790\nAnd that certainly is what part\nof the wall was built for,\n\n486\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.810\namong the many reasons that\nare professed in history.\n\n487\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.620\nBut they take a different approach with\nthe movie to say, \"Hey there's myth and\n\n488\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.970\nlegend as well as fact around it.\" This\nis about one of the myths about the wall,\n\n489\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.860\nas opposed to the reality of the wall.\n\n490\n00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.730\nSo they tell a story about why it\nwas built and what it was used for.\n\n491\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.150\nDuring the course of the movie, you see\nobviously there's attacks taking place\n\n492\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.040\nagainst the wall, they're defending it,\nkind of an interesting thought process.\n\n493\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.970\nBut it's interesting, cuz they segment,\n\n494\n00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.800\nthey being the Chinese,\nat the time they're defending the wall.\n\n495\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.070\nThey segment their defenders into\ndifferent specialized regiments based on\n\n496\n00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.700\nskill, and they deploy them to deal with\ncertain kinds of attacks happening at\n\n497\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.640\ncertain points.\n\n498\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.702\nIt's this great metaphor for\nnetwork security and all the things we do.\n\n499\n00:25:22.702 --> 00:25:26.520\nYou have specialized sets of skills and\ntools for certain kinds of attacks.\n\n500\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.730\nYou deploy those, hopefully,\nto your advantage.\n\n501\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.727\nAnd you use strategy and counter strategy\nto try to trick each other into exposing\n\n502\n00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:36.605\nweaknesses and, therefore, take advantage\nof It was just a great metaphor in\n\n503\n00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:38.860\nmany ways for\nall the things we talked about.\n\n504\n00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.520\nSo it's kind of a cool way\nof illustrating all that.\n\n505\n00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.930\nBut I digress-\n&gt;&gt; There's our homework,\n\n506\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.280\neverybody go watch the wall.\n\n507\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.830\n&gt;&gt; You should go watch,\nyou should go watch,\n\n508\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.500\nit's a good movie,\nyou should watch it, absolutely.\n\n509\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.940\nYou know, I try to tell those\nstories about what we do\n\n510\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.900\nin terms that makes to my students and\nthe people I meet.\n\n511\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.250\nA lot of times,\ncommon shared knowledge, right?\n\n512\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.260\nTribal knowledge makes sense to people and\nit's easier for them to understand.\n\n513\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.370\nSo just one of those things.\n\n514\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.870\nIt may or may not work for you.\n\n515\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.850\nSo there you go.\n\n516\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.600\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n517\n00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.098\nAll right so what about a tax for\nwireless networks?\n\n518\n00:26:05.098 --> 00:26:06.760\nRight we talked about network forensics.\n\n519\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.670\nIt's not just about what's\non quote unquote the wire.\n\n520\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.450\nIt's on what's on the wire but\nalso what's on the wireless wire right?\n\n521\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.360\nIn other words remember we\nhave both wired networks.\n\n522\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.170\nTraditional ethernet, cat five,\ncat six, whatever networks.\n\n523\n00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.320\nBut we also have wireless networks and\nmore and more today.\n\n524\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.790\nTremendous volumes of traffic are\ntranscending those wireless networks and,\n\n525\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.560\nwhile many of the concepts are the same,\n\n526\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.350\nan IP address is an IP address whether\nit's a wired or wireless network.\n\n527\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:37.370\nIPv4, IPv6, DHCP, DNS,\nthey work the same way, wireless or wired.\n\n528\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.530\nWe have a wireless network card,\nit does have a Mac address,\n\n529\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.460\nMac address is the same regardless,\nit doesn't change.\n\n530\n00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.470\nBut there are unique properties in\nspecificity around the wireless network.\n\n531\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.310\nThat is gonna make it slightly different.\n\n532\n00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.760\nOur transmission is essentially\na radio signal, right?\n\n533\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.250\nAnd they go in the air as\nopposed to on the wire for\n\n534\n00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.920\nat least part of that\ntransmission pathway.\n\n535\n00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.080\nNot the whole pathway.\n\n536\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.010\nPeople often forget.\n\n537\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.380\nThat wireless networks\nare hybrid networks.\n\n538\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.710\nBecause they have to be connected\nback to a wired gateway somewhere.\n\n539\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.420\nWe don't really have true wireless\nend-to-end transmission capabilities,\n\n540\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.200\nexcept in very limited, very well defined,\n\n541\n00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.970\nvery tightly controlled circumstances, a\ncommunication pathway between two machines\n\n542\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:23.728\nas an adhoc association is a true\nwireless network but it's limited.\n\n543\n00:27:23.728 --> 00:27:26.759\nYou're communicating within about five\nfeet of each other between two systems\n\n544\n00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:28.590\nusing Bluetooth and Infrared, right?\n\n545\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.840\nSomething like that,\nmaybe 30 feet with Bluetooth.\n\n546\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.810\nBut it's a very limited pathway,\nit's really used for\n\n547\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.300\nvery small amounts of information.\n\n548\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.330\nWe're not telling about\nscaling the enterprise and\n\n549\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.285\nsurfing the web and sending and\nreceiving large amounts of traffic and\n\n550\n00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:44.375\nin data they way we would on\na Commercial Enterprise Network.\n\n551\n00:27:44.375 --> 00:27:46.891\nThose networks are wireless and\nwired hybrids.\n\n552\n00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:51.231\nYou're wireless on the front end within\nabout twenty to thirty, forty, fifty feet,\n\n553\n00:27:51.231 --> 00:27:54.737\nmaybe a hundred hundred and fifty\nfeet of the wireless access point and\n\n554\n00:27:54.737 --> 00:27:58.425\nthen everything else is travelling\non wired communication channels just\n\n555\n00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:01.279\nlike it would normally, so\nwe have to think about that and\n\n556\n00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:05.261\nreally focus our attention on the attacks\naround the front end architecture and\n\n557\n00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:07.810\nthe infrastructure of\nthe wireless networks.\n\n558\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.830\nSo rogue access points being set up,\nmisassociation.\n\n559\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.120\nSo we associate with an access point\nthat says it looks like its the one we\n\n560\n00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.030\nassociate with, but indeed it's not.\n\n561\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.110\nIt's a rogue, things like that.\n\n562\n00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.880\nMisconfigured access points leading\nto vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\n563\n00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.280\nUnauthorized association,\nad hoc connection attacks,\n\n564\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.530\nlike we just talked about.\n\n565\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.580\nHoney spot or honey pot attacks.\n\n566\n00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.070\nOn the wired side honey pots,\non the wireless side,\n\n567\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.240\nnow we call them honey spots.\n\n568\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.220\nEssentially the same idea, but\njust wireless versions of honey pots.\n\n569\n00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.150\nAP MAC spoofing, AP,\naccess point, so AP MAC spoofing.\n\n570\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.580\nJamming signal attacks\nwhere we try to DOS or\n\n571\n00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.165\nDDOS a network by jamming wire\nare the signals forcing you,\n\n572\n00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:51.625\ncorralling you into connecting in certain\nareas, blocking access to others.\n\n573\n00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:55.395\nThese are the kinds of attacks that are\nunique to wireless networks and we have to\n\n574\n00:28:55.395 --> 00:28:59.195\nthink about those from a network forensics\nperspective because obviously, if we're\n\n575\n00:28:59.195 --> 00:29:03.715\nnot thinking about those, we may run into\nsome sort of problems or complications and\n\n576\n00:29:03.715 --> 00:29:07.365\nhave to diagnose them, and those can\nbe issues we would have to be aware of.\n\n577\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.110\nAgain it depends on the kind of\ninfrastructure we're managing and\n\n578\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.660\nit depends on what we're doing.\n\n579\n00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.970\nA lot of times those attacks that are\noccurring against wireless networks maybe\n\n580\n00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.895\nattacks to denial of service or\nto prevent service from occurring.\n\n581\n00:29:20.895 --> 00:29:23.885\nIt's rare that people will use wireless\n\n582\n00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:27.765\nnetworks as the primary mechanism to\nlaunch every attack into the system.\n\n583\n00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:31.375\nIt's one of many different network\nattacks that are seen, obviously.\n\n584\n00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:35.282\nIt's a very interesting and usually,\nnot as heavily defended gateway.\n\n585\n00:29:35.282 --> 00:29:38.100\nSo maybe easier for\nbad actors to gain access through.\n\n586\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.550\nIt's often misconfigured or\nlet access, not let access,\n\n587\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.640\nwe are setting up access on the wireless\nside and perhaps not paying attention.\n\n588\n00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.340\nTo the cross wiring on the back end and\nhow we cross over to wired networks.\n\n589\n00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.190\nA lot of times we talk about and\nindeed should enforce physical and\n\n590\n00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.490\nlogical separation of these networks.\n\n591\n00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.430\nSo air gapping would be physical.\n\n592\n00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:04.390\nYou physically do not hook up that\nwireless access point to the internal\n\n593\n00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.680\nsecure network but rather run it on\na separate VLAN, logically isolating it,\n\n594\n00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.440\nphysically isolating it, and\ngive access to a guest network,\n\n595\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.970\nthat is traditionally just a sign for\nthat access, but doesn't cross over.\n\n596\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.240\nBut when you make that mistake and\nallow those networks to commingle, we open\n\n597\n00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.820\nup a pathway for bad actors to potentially\njump from one place to another.\n\n598\n00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.750\nSo we do have to think about these\nthings as we begin our conversations\n\n599\n00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.850\naround network forensics,\njust really thinking about the logic\n\n600\n00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.410\nof some of the structure of the attacks,\nwhere they come from.\n\n601\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:36.050\nThe reasons why we might be engaged in\nthis kind of investigative behavior and\n\n602\n00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.510\nthe overview of what we will do is what\nwe are establishing here in our first\n\n603\n00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.400\nconversation.\n\n604\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.860\nSo of the up coming conversations\nwe will have about these topics\n\n605\n00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.490\nwill lay out some legal issues associated\ngathering evidence in this area.\n\n606\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.640\nYou can use logs, as evidentiary material,\n\n607\n00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.530\nwe have to follow certain rules,\nbe aware of certain constraints.\n\n608\n00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.350\nWrite logs may or\nmay not be tampered with.\n\n609\n00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.670\nWe have to validate\nthe chain of custody and\n\n610\n00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.620\nthe custodial oversight of that\nevidence to ensure that those\n\n611\n00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.315\nlogs can be used properly,\nwe have to worry about the OSI model.\n\n612\n00:31:03.315 --> 00:31:05.745\nAs crazy as that sounds,\nwe could always come back to that.\n\n613\n00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:08.935\nGotta know what's happened in there by\nlayer, know what kind of activity we're\n\n614\n00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:11.800\nlooking at, so we'll do a quick\nhigh-level, hey, remember this?\n\n615\n00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.870\nSo let's talk about what\nhapppens there discussion.\n\n616\n00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.790\nWe gotta walk through a lot of those\nthings along the way to understanding\n\n617\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.310\nhow we do traffic captures.\n\n618\n00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.120\nGot some cool little\nhands-on demonstrations,\n\n619\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.660\nwe'll take a look at Wireshark for\nyou, always popular, always important.\n\n620\n00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.408\nWe'll take a look at a couple different\nlog management and capture programs,\n\n621\n00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:29.679\nGFI Event Manager,\npretty piece of software,\n\n622\n00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.579\nwe'll show you how that works as well.\n\n623\n00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:33.220\nSo we've got some interesting\nthings coming up.\n\n624\n00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.960\nBut you're gonna have to come back and\nsee us for that,\n\n625\n00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.210\ncuz we,as Daniel always says,\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n626\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.450\n&gt;&gt; We do thank you guys for watching, but\n\n627\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.070\nthere is definitely,\nas Adam has alluded to,\n\n628\n00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.780\na lot of interesting and probably even fun\nthings for us to do in our upcoming show.\n\n629\n00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.130\nSo definitely join us back for\nthe part two and probably beyond that.\n\n630\n00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.759\nJust knowing us, that's how we roll here.\n\n631\n00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:57.650\n[LAUGH] That being said, like we said,\nit is out of time for this episode.\n\n632\n00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.990\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n633\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.708\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n634\n00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:04.191\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n635\n00:32:04.191 --> 00:32:10.038\n[MUSIC]\n\n636\n00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:10.469\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.752\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:16.032\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:20.798\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, we're gonna have for\n\n7\n00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:23.181\nyou nothing other than CHFI Version 9,\n\n8\n00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:28.180\nspecifically continuing our conversation\non network forensics, very fun stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.470\nI'm a huge fan, I love networking.\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.500\nThat's why I got in the business, so\nI really look forward to this talk\n\n11\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.850\nwith our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon, who is welcomed back.\n\n12\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.570\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.410\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well,\nhopefully equally good for you.\n\n14\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.240\nGood for you sir.\n\n15\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.570\nLet's shake on having a good episode.\n\n16\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.835\nAlways good to start off on a high note.\n\n17\n00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:45.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue our\n\n18\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.020\nconversations with network forensics.\n\n19\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.330\nDaniel is so excited,\n\n20\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.890\nI don't wanna do anything other than\nthat because he may get violent.\n\n21\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.080\nWe don't know how that's gonna end.\n\n22\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.440\n&gt;&gt; I've been off my medications.\n\n23\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.666\n&gt;&gt; Well then,\nthat's important, that's good.\n\n24\n00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue talking\n\n25\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.529\nabout network forensics.\n\n26\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.260\nI promised you at the end of the last\nepisode that one of the things that we\n\n27\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.030\nwould have to do and we are going to\ndo and Daniel's going to help me do,\n\n28\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.560\nis just do a quick\nreview of the OSI model.\n\n29\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.640\nNo good discussion on networking anything,\nfill in the blank.\n\n30\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.190\nForensics, security,\nadministration, configuration.\n\n31\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.380\nAny of those things we would do around\nnetworking would be complete and\n\n32\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.990\nindeed would be valuable unless\nwe knew what we were centered on.\n\n33\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.440\nKind of how we're grounded.\n\n34\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.460\nAnd in that conversation,\nthat grounding, that centering,\n\n35\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.600\nthat anchor point is always the OSI model.\n\n36\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.890\nAt least for us,\nin our current conversations and\n\n37\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.580\ncertainly throughout time, whether it\nwas the older DOD, TCP 4 level model,\n\n38\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.300\nthe more current interpretation\nof that seven layer OSI model.\n\n39\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.130\nWe think about the basic constructs and\n\n40\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.250\nthe theory behind how networking is\nmanaged up and down our proverbial stack.\n\n41\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.810\nAnd that is what the OSI model represents\nfor us, thought it would be just good idea\n\n42\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.240\nto quickly run down the OSI model,\ngive a sense of what happens there.\n\n43\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360\nNow just to make sure we understand the\nlayers and maybe a quick little reference\n\n44\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.130\ntool, or protocol, or service, or\na function that may occur at those layers.\n\n45\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.650\nI do have this in the notes, we're not\ngonna take a look at it right now,\n\n46\n00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.290\nwe're just gonna talk for\na minute, we'll put it up.\n\n47\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.630\nIn a moment just to show you but\nlet's just start by talking about it.\n\n48\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.730\nYou wanna go top to bottom or\nbottom to top, what do you think?\n\n49\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Whatever's clever.\n\n50\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.480\nTop to bottom sounds great.\n\n51\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.290\n&gt;&gt; Top to bottom.\n\n52\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.470\nAll right, so we're gonna start at\nlayer seven, application layer.\n\n53\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.200\nWhat we have going on there is really\nyou sitting in front of a computer\n\n54\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.660\nat the interface meaning staring at\nthe screen using an application,\n\n55\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.250\nwhether it's a web browser.\n\n56\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.810\nTraditionally, more and\nmore today a web browser would be used.\n\n57\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.870\nPerhaps it's you, writing an email\nin Outlook or in Sendmail,\n\n58\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.630\nwhatever it may be.\n\n59\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.320\nMaybe it's you creating\nsomething in Word or PowerPoint.\n\n60\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.710\nWho knows what it is, but\nthe application layer is where we interact\n\n61\n00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.290\nas people consuming\ninformation with the model.\n\n62\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.800\nOne of the places we can plug in and\n\n63\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.990\nsee interactivity,\nput our hands on it, so to speak.\n\n64\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.230\nProtocols we may find there.\n\n65\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.450\nWhat would be some of our protocols\nwe find up at the layer seven?\n\n66\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.020\n&gt;&gt; Anything that's an application.\n\n67\n00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.290\nSo, as you said with web, you have http,\nwe have DNS, also another good one.\n\n68\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.390\nFTP would be an application.\n\n69\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.830\nThat's a lot of fun there.\n\n70\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.620\n&gt;&gt; So maybe DHCP?\n\n71\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, that would be there.\n\n72\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.370\n&gt;&gt; You said DNS, right?\n\n73\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.630\n&gt;&gt; DNS.\n&gt;&gt; A real popular\n\n74\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.936\none today that we see more and more\nbecause of web service is soap, right?\n\n75\n00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:07.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, would be there.\n\n76\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.920\nYou know, you're thinking about\nall of these different protocols,\n\n77\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.770\nyou mentioned HTTP, HTTPS,\nobviously, the Twin Brother, or\n\n78\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.800\nSister, if you will, the secure Secure and\nunsecure twins of web transfer.\n\n79\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.970\nSo we think about all those kinds\nof protocols and what exists there.\n\n80\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.520\nWhat about layer six\nthe presentation layer, right?\n\n81\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.780\nWhat are we doing there?\n\n82\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think presentation layer.\n\n83\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.840\nYou think anything I can see is\nvisually giving me some feedback.\n\n84\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.490\nSo these are JPEG's, GIFs,\nany kind of ASCII or unicode.\n\n85\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.240\nAnything that's formatting something so\n\n86\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.820\nthat you can actually visually,\nsee it on your screen.\n\n87\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's gonna help us obviously\nto understand and interpret data,\n\n88\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.330\ncertainly very important.\n\n89\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.660\nIf we're moving down the model as we are,\n\n90\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.370\nwe're actually deconstructing\ndata at the presentation layer.\n\n91\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.540\nIf you think about the logic of\nthe flow we're creating top to bottom,\n\n92\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.200\nwe've created our data at layer seven.\n\n93\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.140\nWe're now gonna start deconstructing,\n\n94\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.470\ndecompiling the data, not a term I\nwould normally use for the OSI model.\n\n95\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.310\nDecompiling tends to refer to Application,\ncreation, the use of a compiler to\n\n96\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.130\ncreate a computer program and decompiler\nto take it apart, deconstructed.\n\n97\n00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.250\nBut generically, the idea is the same,\nwe're taking data, constructed\n\n98\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.490\nat layer seven, we're gonna start\nstripping away all that formatting, right?\n\n99\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.100\nSo the ASCII, the Unicode,\nthe JPEG, whatever it is,\n\n100\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.680\nwe're gonna take all that stuff away,\ngo from human readable at layer seven\n\n101\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.250\nultimately down into the lower levels of\nthe model, into computer friendly, right?\n\n102\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.715\nWe're gonna get down to binary, zero one\ndata, and ultimately package data into\n\n103\n00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:36.065\ndata frames, or data grams you hear\nthem referred to in different ways.\n\n104\n00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:40.325\nBut packages or packets of data\nthat are ultimately could be sent\n\n105\n00:04:40.325 --> 00:04:43.000\nout on the wire down at layer one,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n106\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.040\nAt the presentation layers we move down.\n\n107\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.326\nAll right, very good, so what about,\nwe've got what, layer five, right?\n\n108\n00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:52.180\nThe session layer, so the session layer,\nI think of the session layer,\n\n109\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.850\nDaniel can obviously tell me if he\nlikes this interpretation, if not,\n\n110\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.494\nhe's gonna share his with you but what\nI think of the session layer as being,\n\n111\n00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:03.750\niIs where we establish\nthe rules of connectivity.\n\n112\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.860\nSo, instead of actually connecting,\n\n113\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.350\nwhich we do certainly at the lower\nlevels at the physical layer,\n\n114\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.450\nlayer one where we see the cabling and the\ninfrastructure that supports connectivity.\n\n115\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.219\nADSL, ISDN, T1, Sonet, whatever, all\nthat stuff's down at the physical layer.\n\n116\n00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.090\nNetwork cards certainly there,\ncable there, all that.\n\n117\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.030\nBut, when I think of the session layer,\nlayer five, I'm thinking about\n\n118\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.870\nthe rules that structure and govern how\nwe're going to create our connectivity.\n\n119\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.715\nSo, if I think of connectivity as being\nthe end game, this is the owner's manual,\n\n120\n00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:36.685\ninstruction manual that helps us to\nunderstand how to interpret that,\n\n121\n00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:37.825\nstructure that.\n\n122\n00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:42.505\nAnd gives the ability for the lower\nlevels, transport, network data link,\n\n123\n00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:45.105\nultimately physical to operate\naccording to these rules, so\n\n124\n00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:46.745\neverything is standardized and\n\n125\n00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.797\neverything works the way it should within\nour side of the model, right, our stack.\n\n126\n00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:54.627\nBut then also equally important,\nhow we package those instructions and\n\n127\n00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.437\nthose capabilities into the data.\n\n128\n00:05:56.437 --> 00:06:00.787\nSo that it arrives at the other side where\nwe're sending it to and it's received and\n\n129\n00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:03.617\nit's worked up the model,\nthat those rules are standardized and\n\n130\n00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:05.367\napply on both sides of the connection.\n\n131\n00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:09.390\nSo that, data is interpreted,\nused and processed the proper way.\n\n132\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.616\nMinimizing errors, of course.\n\n133\n00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:13.750\nWe'll talk about error connectivity and\nall those things in an upcoming\n\n134\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.460\nconversation about one\nof the lower levels.\n\n135\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.910\nBut what do we think about that\ndefinition of the session?\n\n136\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.380\nDoes that work?\n&gt;&gt; I like what you said when\n\n137\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.170\nyou said govern.\n\n138\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.350\nTypically, when you read a textbook\ndefinition, they'll say things like,\n\n139\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.830\nis in control of the establishing and\nbreakdown of sessions.\n\n140\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.730\n&gt;&gt; They imply you're actually\nmaking the connection.\n\n141\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.800\nYou're not, you're setting-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I really like that.\n\n142\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.260\nThat's a really good way to put it.\n\n143\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.815\nAnd then you start thinking\nof things like NFS or\n\n144\n00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:41.420\nSM has really good protocols of giving you\nthat tangible idea of what's happening.\n\n145\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.270\n&gt;&gt; So the rules of the game is\nwhat I often refer to it as,\n\n146\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.370\nnot the game itself, but\n\n147\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.012\nthe rules that govern the interplay in how\nyou will play the game at the layer five.\n\n148\n00:06:49.012 --> 00:06:50.610\nAll right, so we agree, very good.\n\n149\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.530\nOtherwise, I was nervous,\n\n150\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.080\nI'd have to leave-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just,\n\n152\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.115\nthat would be the end of our conversation.\n\n153\n00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:54.884\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just go.\n\n154\n00:06:54.884 --> 00:06:56.270\nJust [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't look back.\n\n155\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.864\n&gt;&gt; Just leave.\n\n156\n00:06:56.864 --> 00:06:58.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n157\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.420\nlayer four, the transport layer.\n\n158\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.920\nOne of my more favorite layers,\nactually, to deal with some.\n\n159\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.940\nAlthough I like them all,\nthere's a lot of cool stuff in there.\n\n160\n00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.070\nBut when I think of what I do for a\nliving, what many of you do for a living,\n\n161\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.670\nwanna do, if you wanna become CHFIs but\ncertainly probably already do, right?\n\n162\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.340\nWe're professionals, IT professionals\nmaybe with a security background,\n\n163\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.590\nhopefully learning and\ntaking on more skills as you go.\n\n164\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.620\nI think of the transport of the network\nlayers, certainly the data link layer,\n\n165\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.950\nthese three, in particular, as being\nthe bread and butter of what we do, right?\n\n166\n00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.430\nThis is really where, for us,\nwe apply a lot of our knowledge.\n\n167\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.710\nWe interdict and\ncreate control and security or\n\n168\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.090\nif we screw it up, we mess up and\nallow data to be seen.\n\n169\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.320\nAnd this is really where we\nspend a lot of time operating.\n\n170\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.880\nAlthough, we tend to think\nour ability to operate and\n\n171\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.760\ninteract is coming from\nthe application layer.\n\n172\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.685\nIt's actually here were we make the most,\nat least in my perspective,\n\n173\n00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:48.967\nwhere we make the most impact.\n\n174\n00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:54.684\nSo the transport layer, layer four,\nwe've got the ability here to be able to.\n\n175\n00:07:54.684 --> 00:07:57.961\nFrom my perspective, what I think\nof a control traffic, traffic flow.\n\n176\n00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:00.664\nWe talked about the session\nlayer being the rules and\n\n177\n00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:03.630\nhow we establish the rules\nto govern connectivity.\n\n178\n00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.300\nHere's where we begin to lay out using\nadditional protocols, both TCP and\n\n179\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.160\nUDP, connection oriented, connection less.\n\n180\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.140\nWe layout the structure and the actual\nbox that we're gonna put data into,\n\n181\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.630\nstart to govern with the use\nof things like PCP flags,\n\n182\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.700\nso that we can specify how\na data packet will behave.\n\n183\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.470\nLink those to IP flags and the network\nlayer down below for fragmentation and\n\n184\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.680\noffset, we begin to actually structure\nout data and begin to package it up.\n\n185\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.122\nSo that way, we understand, hence the name\ntransport, how we can send it securely,\n\n186\n00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:37.395\nbut also apply integrity and\nconfidentiality assuming we need\n\n187\n00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.988\nthose to be able to ensure\ndata get there safely and\n\n188\n00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:44.175\nit's not modified in transit without\nour knowledge or our approval.\n\n189\n00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:44.715\nSo you like that?\n\n190\n00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:46.605\n&gt;&gt; That's good, that's very good,\nthat's good, sir.\n\n191\n00:08:46.605 --> 00:08:50.211\n&gt;&gt; Transport layer TCP-UDP-\n&gt;&gt; It's like you know this.\n\n192\n00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:51.632\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know I just,\n\n193\n00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.580\nI went to sleep last night.\n\n194\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.140\nAnd I woke up this morning,\nand it was just there.\n\n195\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.000\nI slept well.\n\n196\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.820\n&gt;&gt; Osmosis.\n\n197\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.690\n&gt;&gt; What's that commercial they do for\nthat hotel chain?\n\n198\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.850\n&gt;&gt; Holiday Inn Express.\n\n199\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.760\n&gt;&gt; I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express,\nbut I slept like I did.\n\n200\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I woke up with all\n\n201\n00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.370\nthis knowledge.\n\n202\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.080\nAll right, so, remember,\njust the difference here,\n\n203\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.780\nthe key distinguishing factor for us, TCP\nversus UDP, connection oriented protocol,\n\n204\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.120\nTCP send and\nacknowledge through a handshake And\n\n205\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.400\nthen UDP, connectionless,\nsend and forget, as we often say.\n\n206\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.290\nYou, in other words, as the recipient must\nrequest an additional resend of packets\n\n207\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.990\nusing UDP TCP at three cents\nautomatically based on the machinery and\n\n208\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.270\nwhether we have an acknowledgment or not.\n\n209\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.810\nOn the network layer, layer three,\nwhat is our most favorite function and\n\n210\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.140\nprotocol that exists at layer three?\n\n211\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.610\n&gt;&gt; The wonderful world of IP.\n\n212\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.230\n&gt;&gt; The wonderful world of IP, almost like\nthe wonderful world of gum ball except\n\n213\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.580\nit's the wonderful world of IP.\n\n214\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.180\nThe only reason I know that\nis because I have kids,\n\n215\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.750\notherwise I would never watch it [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful world of gumball.\n\n217\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.190\nBut IP, right?\n\n218\n00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.450\nAnd people often think, many people do,\nI'm sure you may have heard this,\n\n219\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.690\nyou may or may not know this, you may\nnot think about this, but we say TCP-IP.\n\n220\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.290\nWe smack those two protocols and that\nwhole logic of them existing together and\n\n221\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.130\nhave since the 1970s when\nthe RFCs were written and\n\n222\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.420\nwe just tend to refer\nto them in one graph.\n\n223\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.900\nBut in fact,\nthey are distinctly different protocols,\n\n224\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.060\nhave very different functions\nat different levels.\n\n225\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.000\nAnd TCP IP is actually a protocol\nsuite of tools and protocols that\n\n226\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.650\nis combined together to create\nfunctionality, not an all in one protocol.\n\n227\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.390\nI actually had this raging conversation\nwith one of my customers at one point.\n\n228\n00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.960\nNo, TCP/IP is a protocol.\n\n229\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.780\nWell, in fact,\nit's actually two protocols.\n\n230\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n231\n00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.330\nit is not a suite of products and tools.\n\n232\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.480\nNo, it is a suite of tools\nas well as protocols.\n\n233\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.050\nSo you can show them, as they say,\nlead a water, lead a water,\n\n234\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.890\nlead a water to a horse but\nyou can't make them drink.\n\n235\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.180\nLead a horse to water but\nyou cannot make them drink.\n\n236\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.010\nBut I had this conversation,\nactually, they insisted\n\n237\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.780\nthat TCP/IP was a single a protocol and\njust operated as a monolithic bot.\n\n238\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.900\n&gt;&gt; I just love when people question-\n&gt;&gt; Put their ignorance on display.\n\n239\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and I've actually had to say,\nwhen you say things like this,\n\n240\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.690\nit's like saying I don't\nknow what I'm talking about.\n\n241\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.190\nAnd since this is what I do for\na living and\n\n242\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.730\nyou don't I think I might\nhave the upper hand in this.\n\n243\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI never want to embarrass somebody and\n\n244\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.320\nmake it painfully obvious that\nthey're wrong if I can avoid it.\n\n245\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.607\nBut its one thing to be\nthought of as an idiot,\n\n246\n00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:10.355\nits another open your mouth [CROSSTALK]\nunequivocally prove that you are.\n\n247\n00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:14.315\nAnd I feel the gloves come off when\nyou open your mouth and unequivocally\n\n248\n00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:18.290\nassert that you feel that you are indeed\nopen to that kind of criticism.\n\n249\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.480\nSo I thought better of it.\n\n250\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.750\nI was polite and I did not embarrass them,\nbut you know looking back on it-\n\n251\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.660\n&gt;&gt; It was really tempting.\n\n252\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.310\n&gt;&gt; I should've.\n\n253\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.470\nCuz they were not nice.\n\n254\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.440\nHistory from that point forward\nshowed that I was actually\n\n255\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.770\nwell justified had I done it\nbecause they were not nice.\n\n256\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.870\nBut I digress.\n\n257\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.790\nNot important.\n\n258\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.350\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n259\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway.\n\n260\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.460\nSo the network\n\n261\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.120\nlayer.\nLayer three.\n\n262\n00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.760\nSo let's think about, we haven't really\n\n263\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.560\ntalked about hardware up until this point\nand some of the functions that come in.\n\n264\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.280\nBut it's probably important to lay\nin some of that as we go here,\n\n265\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.203\nso what kind of hardware\nwill we see at layer three?\n\n266\n00:11:47.203 --> 00:11:50.330\n&gt;&gt; Layer Three usually you're talking\nabout routers, maybe even firewalls.\n\n267\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330\nObviously, Layer Three switches or\nmulti-layer switches would also\n\n268\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.330\noperate at that level Obviously at other\nlevels as well because it is a switch but\n\n269\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.740\nthose are the three most common\ndevices you'll see there.\n\n270\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.140\n&gt;&gt; All right and\nthe only thing I will adjust, and\n\n271\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.750\nwe'll talk about it when we\nget to layer two in a minute.\n\n272\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.140\nYou mentioned switches, very important.\n\n273\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.900\nWe do wanna account for\n\n274\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.390\nthe fact they do exist, certainly in\nthe modern day at layer three but\n\n275\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.340\nthe traditional classic definition of\na switch and where we locate it is a layer\n\n276\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.740\ntwo function because switches are using\nMac addresses to build their routing\n\n277\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.350\ntables at layer two whereas routers\nwill use IP addresses at layer three.\n\n278\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.780\nBut we do see multilevel or\n\n279\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.640\nmultilayer switches because of\nthe management capabilities of the switch.\n\n280\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.370\nAlso, firewalls you mentioned, which is\ngreat, we do see multilayer firewalls cuz\n\n281\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.640\nfirewalls are traditionally\nalso seen at layer seven.\n\n282\n00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.220\nApplication firewalls,\nglass, for instance.\n\n283\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I forgot about that.\n\n284\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.570\n&gt;&gt; Web application firewalls,\nwe see them operating up there.\n\n285\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.860\nSo Socks proxy, proxies would be up\nat that level and things like that.\n\n286\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.430\nSo we see hardware up and\n\n287\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.140\ndown the OSI model, depending on\nfunctionality pegged to the layer.\n\n288\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.520\nWhich is important to think about that.\n\n289\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.390\nSo we have IP,\ntheir are flags for both TCP and\n\n290\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.050\nIP different function as I mentioned, six\ndefault flags for TCP, probably good for\n\n291\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.560\nyou to have a sense of\nthem if you don't already.\n\n292\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.820\nThe flags for IP are really just\nto frag and don't fragment so\n\n293\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.020\nwe have a two stage or\ntwo flag set up in IP at layer three.\n\n294\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.430\nSix flags for TCP are urge.\n\n295\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.162\n&gt;&gt; Is it over Georgia?\n\n296\n00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:06.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] And\n\n297\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.330\nI actually went to Six Flags over\nto Georgia when I was in kid.\n\n298\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.220\nAlso in Virginia they had\na bunch of Six Flags parks.\n\n299\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.050\n&gt;&gt; There was one in Texas as well.\n\n300\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't know how\nmany there are today.\n\n301\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.550\nI know they kind of went\nthrough some hard times.\n\n302\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.280\nBut yeah there were a bunch\nof different parts.\n\n303\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.560\nI went to where was it?\n\n304\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.040\nI think it was the one in Georgia.\n\n305\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.410\nI rode the mind bender.\n\n306\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.180\n&gt;&gt; How was that?\n\n307\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.290\n&gt;&gt; That was the first triple\nloop roller coaster in America.\n\n308\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.490\nWhen it was built, and\nI actually wrote it when it was built.\n\n309\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Did you wear your adult diaper?\n\n310\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.950\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no I, this was like when I\nwas a kid I was you know, like, I dunno,\n\n311\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.670\nmaybe 10, 12 years old.\n\n312\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.000\n&gt;&gt; You were wearing a child's diaper.\n\n313\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.960\n&gt;&gt; I was wearing a child's diaper at\nthe time but, never the same sense.\n\n314\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet.\n\n315\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.010\n&gt;&gt; After that I went into IT and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see the man,\n\n316\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.920\nyou see what it does to\npeople it is a mind-bender.\n\n317\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.500\nIt just crippled me for life.\n\n318\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.510\nI just,-\n&gt;&gt; You was a normal child.\n\n319\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.440\n&gt;&gt; I would not be the person I\nam today had I not written that-\n\n320\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.011\n&gt;&gt; Superhero origin story.\n\n321\n00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:51.963\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n322\n00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:54.931\nExcept I don't have spidey powers,\nI have mind-bending powers.\n\n323\n00:13:54.931 --> 00:13:55.771\n&gt;&gt; Claws-out hands.\n\n324\n00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:56.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I did ride that.\n\n325\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.289\nThat was actually a pretty\ncool roller coaster.\n\n326\n00:13:59.289 --> 00:14:00.097\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n327\n00:14:00.097 --> 00:14:02.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was it, that was the story.\n\n328\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.700\nThere was nothing more to it than that.\n\n329\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Next layer.\n[LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.302\n&gt;&gt; That's how it all relates,\n\n331\n00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.210\nit comes back together\nthrough the multi-layer loop,\n\n332\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.960\nthree loops, a triple loop roller coaster.\n\n333\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.770\nYeah, that was.\n\n334\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.405\nThat was kind of crazy.\n\n335\n00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:11.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could do that stuff when I was a kid.\n\n336\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.732\nI can't do that anymore.\n\n337\n00:14:12.732 --> 00:14:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.820\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, so at layer three,\n\n339\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.320\nwe're talking about the flags.\n\n340\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.630\nThe two flags, as I said,\nfragment, don't fragment.\n\n341\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.820\nWas about to run through the TCP flags for\nyou.\n\n342\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.020\nSo urg for urgent, psh, push, what else?\n\n343\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.810\nFin, finalize or finish.\n\n344\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.910\nAck and syn, acknowledge and synchronize.\n\n345\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.740\nand RST for reset.\n\n346\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.410\nSo, the six flags that make up\nthe TCP protocol at layer 4,\n\n347\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.770\njust make sure you're familiar with them.\n\n348\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.450\nWe've talked extensively\nabout them in other episodes.\n\n349\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.150\nNetwork Plus, Security Plus,\n\n350\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.590\na lot of other shows,\nwe go into them in more detail.\n\n351\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.130\nThe data link layer, layer 2, this is\nan interesting layer because it's the only\n\n352\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.110\nlayer in the oversight model\nthat has two sublayers.\n\n353\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.050\nWe don't usually see sublayers broken out,\nbut we see distinct functionality broken\n\n354\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.990\nout In this overall layer\nit's the two sublayers.\n\n355\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.320\nWe have the Mac sublayer, traditional\nMac address as we think about it,\n\n356\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.630\nand LLC, logical link control.\n\n357\n00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nError control correction, so\nthe back end of the data packet\n\n358\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.220\nwhich is called the trailer is where we\nsee the CRCs, cyclic redundancy checks,\n\n359\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.570\nerror control and correction check sums,\nintegrity mechanisms, in other words.\n\n360\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.230\nAnd that's what happens at the LLC,\nlogical link control there.\n\n361\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:25.460\nWe see protocols here like L2TP,\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n362\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.140\nKind of a layer 2 and a half protocol,\n\n363\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.350\ncuz we often talk about it kinda\nstraddling between 2 and 3.\n\n364\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.200\nBut we see that capability,\nsee our Mac address is here.\n\n365\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.310\nWe talked about promiscuous mode.\n\n366\n00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.370\nWe'll talk about it again in network\nforensics as the ability to be able to\n\n367\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.880\nmanipulate the use of the Mac address\nto identify traffic bound for\n\n368\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.750\nour interface and pay attention to it.\n\n369\n00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.653\nPromiscuous mode drivers,\nWIN, PCAP and or LIB PCAP.\n\n370\n00:15:48.653 --> 00:15:51.378\nThe Linux and Windows version of\nthose drivers will operate and\n\n371\n00:15:51.378 --> 00:15:54.310\nmanipulate traffic at layer two of\nthe OS model as you install them so\n\n372\n00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.180\njust make sure that you're aware of that.\n\n373\n00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.227\nAnd then the physical layer.\n\n374\n00:15:57.227 --> 00:15:58.500\nWe talked about this already.\n\n375\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.528\nKind of hinted at what it does.\n\n376\n00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:02.278\nWhere the connectivity occurs,\nwireless or wired.\n\n377\n00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:08.050\nSo things like ADSL, ISDN, T1, SONET, take\nyour pick, ATM frame, whatever it may be.\n\n378\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.390\nAll those connectivity mechanisms and\nmethodologies manifest at layer one or\n\n379\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.890\nthe physical layer of the OSI model.\n\n380\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.630\nSo making sure we understand\nwhat happens there.\n\n381\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.340\nJust a review of the OSI model,\nensuring you're comfortable with it.\n\n382\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.510\nFunctional knowledge important for\nmany, many aspects of what we do.\n\n383\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.530\nPerhaps important for you as you study for\nthe exam, be good for\n\n384\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.580\nyou to understand what\nhappens in each layer.\n\n385\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.720\nAttribute the proper hardware.\n\n386\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.400\nI forgot to mention Bridges is a layer\ntwo function in terms of hardware.\n\n387\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.870\nA hub, although hubs are really\nnot used anymore, but\n\n388\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.500\nwill be an example of a layer\none piece of hardware.\n\n389\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.500\nSo just keep that in mind to\nthink about the logic of that.\n\n390\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.790\nBut important for\nyou to have a sense of those things.\n\n391\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.370\nWith regards to the OSI model,\nkinda putting that off to the side,\n\n392\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.900\nmaking sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n393\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.210\nWhat about some legal issues associated\nwith using logs as evidence, right?\n\n394\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:00.010\nI mentioned at the end of our last show\nthat there may be some reasons for\n\n395\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.620\nus to be aware of the standards or\nrequirements,\n\n396\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.400\nthe concerns,\nnot just around chain of custody, but\n\n397\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.100\naround the viability of evidence\nacross many, many areas.\n\n398\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.690\nAnd certainly log files\nfall into this category.\n\n399\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.520\nWe have to make sure that logs\nhave not been tampered with.\n\n400\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.810\nWe have to assert and\nassure that they have validity.\n\n401\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.820\nThere's integrity associated with them.\n\n402\n00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.164\nThere's always the opportunity for\nlogs to be misrepresented.\n\n403\n00:17:21.164 --> 00:17:26.220\nIf we're not using NTP, network time\nprotocol to be able to synchronize time.\n\n404\n00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.460\nLogs can be misrepresented and/or\nmanipulated because timestamps can be\n\n405\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.400\naltered, so this is important.\n\n406\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.150\nNTP, by the way, know what protocol\nis used to carry NTP traffic, and\n\n407\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.420\nport it operates on?\n\n408\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.620\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say LDAP?\n\n409\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.490\nIt's a Windows thing.\n\n410\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.150\n&gt;&gt; NTP is not a Windows thing.\n\n411\n00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.210\nNTP, network time protocol.\n\n412\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.810\n&gt;&gt; They use it.\n\n413\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.990\n&gt;&gt; Windows does use it, but\nit's not the only OS that uses it.\n\n414\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.100\nBut generically,\nlet me narrow it with you,\n\n415\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.650\nwe're communicating either on TCP or UDP.\n\n416\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.660\nThe underlying carrier\nprotocol in other words that\n\n417\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.890\nmoves the NTP traffic back and forth.\n\n418\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.810\nWould it be an acknowledged or\na non-acknowledged packet?\n\n419\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.110\nAnd then what port does it work on?\n\n420\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.830\n&gt;&gt; You know, I don't know.\n\n421\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.490\n&gt;&gt; Good that you don't.\n\n422\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.155\nBecause I do.\n\n423\n00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:13.580\n[LAUGH] So it is, as you can see there.\n\n424\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.915\nDavid helped us out.\n\n425\n00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:17.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is gonna be on UDP and\n\n426\n00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.340\nPort 123 primarily.\n\n427\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.000\n&gt;&gt; So TCP and UDP.\n\n428\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.180\n&gt;&gt; We attribute it to UDP primarily.\n\n429\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.330\nThat's where we traditionally see it.\n\n430\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.780\nIt is considered to be one of those\nthings that you don't often acknowledge\n\n431\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.960\nthe send and receive of.\n\n432\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.830\nYou just get the packets because\nyou're not acknowledging the sync.\n\n433\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.355\nThe application layer\ndeals with the sync but\n\n434\n00:18:36.355 --> 00:18:40.022\nit's traditionally attributed\nto a UDP send using port 123.\n\n435\n00:18:40.022 --> 00:18:41.409\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, so\n\n436\n00:18:41.409 --> 00:18:43.280\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n437\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.970\nReason I mention that is\nthat little kind of minutia.\n\n438\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:52.010\nThat little kind of geek trivia if you\nwill may come up at certain points,\n\n439\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.660\nyou never know when.\n\n440\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.310\nPerhaps, on an exam, perhaps you're\nsitting on a plane and somebody says, hey,\n\n441\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.520\ndo you know?\n\n442\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.060\nYou should move away from them quickly by\nthe way if they do if you're on a plane.\n\n443\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.313\nYou don't wanna have that conversation at\n35,000 feet going several hundred miles\n\n444\n00:19:05.313 --> 00:19:06.391\nan hour if you could avoid it.\n\n445\n00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:10.052\nBut If somebody does ask you on the exam,\nright, it is important for\n\n446\n00:19:10.052 --> 00:19:12.940\nyou to be aware of that,\nright, just so you know.\n\n447\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.780\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n448\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.665\nJust so\nyou're aware of those kind of things.\n\n449\n00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.800\nAnd we see an interesting\npoint in the chat window.\n\n450\n00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.270\nLet me just address it really quickly.\n\n451\n00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.810\nSo one of our audience members,\nDavid, who is always so\n\n452\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:30.000\nkind to offer his comments and his insight\nwhen he does have the opportunity to.\n\n453\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.390\nVery knowledgeable,\nbeen doing this a very long time.\n\n454\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.910\nMade reference right now to the fact,\nnumber one, gave us the protocol and\n\n455\n00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.280\nport number, so thank you for that.\n\n456\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.660\nBut also made reference to the fact just\nnow that he had to open both TCP and\n\n457\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.870\nUDP to get NTP traffic to sync properly\nand pass through his firewall.\n\n458\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.450\nAnd that's the key right there.\n\n459\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.710\nGoing outbound to sync properly,\nyou would have to account for both flows.\n\n460\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.570\nBut if NTP sources are inside\nyour network, traditionally, and\n\n461\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.830\nDanny you were mentioning this,\nlet's say you're using a Windows solution-\n\n462\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Domain controller, yeah.\n\n463\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.350\n&gt;&gt; Domain controllers are NTP\nsources traditionally.\n\n464\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:07.030\nAnd they may sync separately out to\na NTP rack mounted server of some kind,\n\n465\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.830\nan appliance traditionally is what we see.\n\n466\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.580\nThey may ultimately sync out, right, to...\n\n467\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:17.790\nYes, and absolutely they may sync out to\nultimately the atomic clock is used a lot\n\n468\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.460\nof the times, so you're synching out bound\nto a source on the wire over the internet.\n\n469\n00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.493\nAnd David's point which I just\nwanted to call out and thank him for\n\n470\n00:20:25.493 --> 00:20:27.042\ncontributing to us is this.\n\n471\n00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:29.470\nIf it's going outbound,\nyou do have to account for both protocols,\n\n472\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.510\nhe's absolutely right, TCP and UDP.\n\n473\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.350\nBut traditionally inbound,\nnot inbound rather but\n\n474\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.218\non the LAN,\nif we're inside behind the firewall.\n\n475\n00:20:37.218 --> 00:20:40.430\nWe're not doing external sync,\nwe don't have to worry about that\n\n476\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.190\ntraffic because we're not worried\nabout the firewall passing it.\n\n477\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.500\nAnd so\nit's just a question of as he points out,\n\n478\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.210\nchecking to ensure accuracy and\nmaking sure it's working the right way.\n\n479\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.780\nAnd it's a great way to think\nabout that because that is\n\n480\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.140\na really important thought process.\n\n481\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.100\nSo just thinking about that and keeping\nthat in mind in the real world, right?\n\n482\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.430\nJust how you would deal with\nthat is an important point.\n\n483\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.485\nSo, when we think about logs and we think\nabout the ability to be able to use them,\n\n484\n00:21:02.485 --> 00:21:04.770\nwell we have to be thinking\nabout all this kind of stuff,\n\n485\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.230\nis the information accurate?\n\n486\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.090\nAre we getting the proper time sync and\nif we are, great, and if not,\n\n487\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.960\nthen obviously we have issues.\n\n488\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.840\nCan we authoritatively attribute that log\nthrough a chain of custody to a system and\n\n489\n00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.100\nhave integrity around it?\n\n490\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.941\nAnd if we can,\nis there some sort of custodian or\n\n491\n00:21:20.941 --> 00:21:25.274\nsome sort of evidentiary manager that\ncan speak specifically to the fact\n\n492\n00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:28.625\nthat that log has not been\nmodified since acquisition?\n\n493\n00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.250\nAnd we can establish that\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n494\n00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.340\nThis is also very important for\nus to consider.\n\n495\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.520\nSo we have to have a custodian or\n\n496\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.510\nwhat we call other qualified witness\nthat can speak to the accuracy and\n\n497\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.730\nthe integrity of the logs,\nit’s very important to think about that.\n\n498\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.990\nThe custodian has to be able to offer\ntestimony about the sort of system\n\n499\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.650\nthe log came from, the state of the\nsystem, the configuration, the capture.\n\n500\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:53.020\nAll the information, the documentary\nstory around the acquisition of that log.\n\n501\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:59.040\nAnd its maintenance through the lifecycle\nafterwards to attribute the custodian and\n\n502\n00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.450\nlink the custodian's testimony\nto the chain of custody.\n\n503\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.710\nWe've talked about this and\nhow important this is.\n\n504\n00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.760\nReliability and integrity are the things\nwe focus on in the discussion of evidence,\n\n505\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.970\nand whether it is justified to enter it or\nnot.\n\n506\n00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.250\nSo we have to be thinking about that and\njust make sure.\n\n507\n00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.790\nWere log entries in some way suspicious?\n\n508\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.858\nWas there evidence of manipulation?\n\n509\n00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:20.878\nWe have to speak to these kind of things.\n\n510\n00:22:20.878 --> 00:22:24.580\nWe found these inconsistencies, but we can\naccount for them because of this behavior,\n\n511\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.775\nand these are the kinds of things\nwe would have to speak to for\n\n512\n00:22:26.775 --> 00:22:30.090\nwanna enter logs into evidence or\nat least be aware of them.\n\n513\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.128\nThe FRE, the Federal rules of Evidence\nthat we have talked about before.\n\n514\n00:22:33.128 --> 00:22:38.687\nFRE, United States Federal Rules of\nEvidence, Rule Number 803 specifically,\n\n515\n00:22:38.687 --> 00:22:42.530\nRecords of Regularly Conducted Activity\nas Evidence.\n\n516\n00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.070\nIf we go to my notes here for\njust a minute, I just wanna show you.\n\n517\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.100\nThis is a quote.\nIt's a long one.\n\n518\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.350\nI'm not gonna read it, but\nI just wanna show it to you.\n\n519\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.320\nCan we go full screen, just to make\nthis a little bit easier to see?\n\n520\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.420\nIt'll be a little bit easier for\nyou there.\n\n521\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.440\nAnd let's just do this just\nto get that out of the way.\n\n522\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.480\nAnd let's just center that right there,\nright.\n\n523\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.610\nSo you can see that.\n\n524\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.380\nSo FRE Rule 803 Records of\nRegularly Conducted Activity as Evidence.\n\n525\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.070\nImportant for us to be aware of the fact\nthat this rule of evidence speaks to\n\n526\n00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.460\nthe use of logs or\nthe ability to use logs and\n\n527\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.950\nhave them available to us as part of\nthe evidence that we may present.\n\n528\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.310\nMemorandum report record or data\ncompilation in any form of acts, events,\n\n529\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.440\nconditions, opinions or\ndiagnoses made at or\n\n530\n00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.340\nnear the time by or from information\ntransmitted by a person with knowledge\n\n531\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.180\nif kept in the course of regularly\nconducted business activity.\n\n532\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.020\nAnd if it was the regular practice of that\nbusiness activity, to make the memorandum,\n\n533\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.130\nreport, record or data compilation, all\nas shown by testimony of the custodian.\n\n534\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.610\nThat's the role I was talking about,\nthe custodian or expert witness, right, or\n\n535\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.020\nother qualified witness.\n\n536\n00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.480\nUnless the source of information or\nthe method or\n\n537\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.902\ncircumstances of preparation\nindicate lack of trustworthiness.\n\n538\n00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:57.956\nIn other words, we can support and\nprovide documentary evidence to\n\n539\n00:23:57.956 --> 00:24:03.287\nmake our claim that business records,\nlogs fall under this category.\n\n540\n00:24:03.287 --> 00:24:08.471\nWould be valid and be seen as accurate\nin terms of representing the timeline of\n\n541\n00:24:08.471 --> 00:24:14.770\nevents, as long as they are kept under\nstrict, standardized, procedural behavior.\n\n542\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.980\nWe can validate that was done.\n\n543\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.890\nWhat we want to avoid here, and\nwhat we want to make sure we understand is\n\n544\n00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.770\nthat we're not pointing to the log and\nsaying, look, that's what happened.\n\n545\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.892\nBut we don't normally keep a log, we\nhappened to turn it on right before that\n\n546\n00:24:25.892 --> 00:24:28.240\nevent occurred and turned if off\nagain right after it finished.\n\n547\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.680\nBut how lucky are we-\n&gt;&gt; What a coincidence.\n\n548\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.270\n&gt;&gt; That we happened to get that log\nentry at that exact moment in time.\n\n549\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.130\n&gt;&gt; That was a close one [LAUGH].\n\n550\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.756\n&gt;&gt; That was.\nThe judge will look at you and\n\n551\n00:24:35.756 --> 00:24:37.177\nsay absolutely not, right?\n\n552\n00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:37.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n553\n00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:40.728\nif that log is running 24/7 all the time,\nit's there,\n\n554\n00:24:40.728 --> 00:24:44.260\nit's just part of normal business\nbehavior, it's always there.\n\n555\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.620\nWe happened to capture that, but\n\n556\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.880\na whole bunch other stuff as well,\nit's a whole different conversation.\n\n557\n00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.820\nPoint is, this must be standardized,\nregulated, procedure driven, and\n\n558\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.290\npolicy managed behavior that we\ncould attribute to those things.\n\n559\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.148\nDocumentary evidence shows that.\n\n560\n00:24:58.148 --> 00:25:01.650\nAnd that is going to continue both,\nor be in place before,\n\n561\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.300\nduring, and after the events in question.\n\n562\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.340\nAnd we can then validate the integrity and\n\n563\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.560\nthe authenticity of this\nrepresentation of those events.\n\n564\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.700\nIf we can speak to that,\nand if that is possible,\n\n565\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.500\nthen FRE Rule 803 says we're able\nto enter that data into evidence.\n\n566\n00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.260\nAnd we wanna make sure we understand why\nwe can do that, where that comes from.\n\n567\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.820\nAnd again, to be clear, there are United\nStates Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n568\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.810\nMany other countries have\nrules very similar to this.\n\n569\n00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.100\nThey may be referred to\nunder a different name,\n\n570\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.720\ncertainly not gonna be called FRE Rule\n803, but the intent is there.\n\n571\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.920\nAnd in most modern legal systems,\nyou will find some sort of indication\n\n572\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.280\nthat there is an allowance for this, but\nyou would obviously have to localize that\n\n573\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.140\nto whatever country and\nwhatever system you may be dealing with.\n\n574\n00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.040\nBut this is a very common thought process,\nand\n\n575\n00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.475\none that exists in most legal\nsystems around the world today.\n\n576\n00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:50.270\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n577\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.830\nHaving said that, this rule has\nbeen stretched to be interpreting\n\n578\n00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.930\nthe fact that we have digital data today.\n\n579\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.685\nBecause when the rule was originally\nwritten, there was no reference to\n\n580\n00:25:58.685 --> 00:26:02.110\nthe idea that computers could provide\nthis kind of documentary evidence.\n\n581\n00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.200\nAnd so we understand that where it says\nreport, record, or data compilation,\n\n582\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.720\ndata compilation implies, among other\nthings, that we may be looking at a log.\n\n583\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.570\nSo just understand the logic of that and\nunderstand what that means.\n\n584\n00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.360\nBut in general, we're thinking\nabout those kinds of events.\n\n585\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.020\nWe also think about event correlation,\n\n586\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.010\nthe idea of being able to relate\na set of events that have occurred in\n\n587\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.260\nsome sort of time interval to other events\ngoing both before, during, after it.\n\n588\n00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:30.990\nSo if we see a incorrect or\nunauthenticated log on, and\n\n589\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.260\nthen five minutes later we see\na hack against the system,\n\n590\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.320\nand five minutes after that exfiltration\nof sensitive corporate data through one or\n\n591\n00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.560\nmore gateways out of our system without\nour permission, without our authority,\n\n592\n00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.628\nwithout our knowledge.\n\n593\n00:26:43.628 --> 00:26:47.400\nWe could event correlate all of those\nevents along a timeline and say,\n\n594\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.620\nwell, the initial event that lead to\nthis was the unauthenticated log on that\n\n595\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.770\noccurred in this system, which then\nlead five minutes later to this.\n\n596\n00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.045\nAnd we could plot out the timeline and\ntell a story.\n\n597\n00:26:57.045 --> 00:26:58.627\nThis will be event correlation.\n\n598\n00:26:58.627 --> 00:27:02.676\nAnd so the steps associated with\nevent correlation, event aggregation,\n\n599\n00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:07.125\nevent masking, event filtering, and\nour most favorite, root cause analysis.\n\n600\n00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.440\nWe always come back to this\nidea of root cause analysis.\n\n601\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.560\nBeing able to answer the question\nwhy did something happen, right?\n\n602\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.530\nVery important for us to think about that.\n\n603\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.720\nAnd when we think about\ncorrelation activities,\n\n604\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.850\nand think about the idea behind event\ncorrelation, we're thinking about same\n\n605\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.760\nversus different platform, or same versus\ncross-platform, correlation oftentimes.\n\n606\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.590\nSame platform?\n\n607\n00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.450\nEssentially the same operating system.\n\n608\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.550\nWe're looking at all Windows machines and\nlooking at the impact and\n\n609\n00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.710\nthe interaction between them.\n\n610\n00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.900\nCross-platform, we're looking at\nWindows and other systems, Linux, Unix.\n\n611\n00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.380\nSo a lot of times when we\nhave web hosting involved,\n\n612\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.240\nwe often see cross-platform correlation.\n\n613\n00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.600\nThe majority of web hosting today\nis done on non-Windows platforms.\n\n614\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.639\nWhen we have virtualization involved, we\noften see cross-platform because a lot of\n\n615\n00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:56.170\nhost virtualization systems may be\nrunning VMware, may be running Citrix,\n\n616\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.588\nthe Zen platform, the ESXi or\nvSphere platform, are Linux Unix based.\n\n617\n00:28:01.588 --> 00:28:06.680\nWhereas the Hyper-V platform, the third\nmajor provider of virtualization services,\n\n618\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.790\nMicrosoft, is Windows based, right?\n\n619\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.340\nSo we're gonna see cross-platform\ncollaboration, communication,\n\n620\n00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.140\nand therefore event correlation\njust between hosts and\n\n621\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.730\nVMs running on them because the guest\noperating systems are gonna be often\n\n622\n00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.230\nbased on a different OS\nthan the hosting is.\n\n623\n00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.780\nSo we have to think about that and just\nunderstand the logic of how we go back and\n\n624\n00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.050\nforth and compare the two.\n\n625\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.380\nBecause with a network\nforensics thought process,\n\n626\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.760\nwe're looking at traffic flows often\nfrom guest OSs in the virtual and\n\n627\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.750\nCloud world, out through a host and\nout onto a network and back again.\n\n628\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.200\nWe have to account for\nevery stop along the way.\n\n629\n00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.266\nThe configuration of the virtual switches,\nfor instance,\n\n630\n00:28:41.266 --> 00:28:45.247\nin the host, the configuration of the\nvirtual network cards in the guest OSs.\n\n631\n00:28:45.247 --> 00:28:48.300\nOr when I say guest OSs I mean\nvirtual machines generically.\n\n632\n00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.830\nWe just call them guest OSs traditionally.\n\n633\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.220\nBut in the virtual machine,\nthe settings there.\n\n634\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.300\nVersus the configuration on the host that\nallows those networks to be propagated and\n\n635\n00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.770\npassed out into the physical world.\n\n636\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.950\nThe network settings in the data center\nand beyond, are they software defined or\n\n637\n00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.290\nare they manually applied?\n\n638\n00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.500\nThere's all these things we'd have to\nthink about as forensic investigators\n\n639\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.660\nto help us understand that traffic flow.\n\n640\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.413\nAnd that's more complicated in a virtual\nand Cloud world today than it would be in\n\n641\n00:29:13.413 --> 00:29:17.500\na non-Cloud, a non-virtual world today\nwhere we're dealing with physical entities\n\n642\n00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.400\nand just configuration of\nthose network setting there.\n\n643\n00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.810\nWe're extracting, in other words,\n\n644\n00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.090\nand extrapolating additional layers\nof complexity when we virtualize, and\n\n645\n00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.620\nwe have to account for\nthose as forensic investigators.\n\n646\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.400\nSo it is one of those areas that\ncan be very interesting, but\n\n647\n00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.580\nalso incredibly complex to work with.\n\n648\n00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.060\nIf you have software defined networking,\nand software defined storage, and\n\n649\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.640\nsoftware defined data centers all up and\ndown the stack,\n\n650\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.180\nthere is a lot of additional work as\nforensic investigators we have to do.\n\n651\n00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.890\nBecause we have to look at all\nthe configurations that are applied, and\n\n652\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.660\nwere they standardized,\ncontinuous monitoring has to be in place.\n\n653\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.010\nWe have to pull those log files and\nlook at whether or\n\n654\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.760\nnot there was deviation from those\nbaselines and those applied settings.\n\n655\n00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.850\nAnd if so, under what conditions and why?\n\n656\n00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.600\nAnd was there remediation,\nand if so, at what point?\n\n657\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.080\nAnd did the attack occur during the gap,\nthe delta, between noncompliance and\n\n658\n00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.000\nremediation?\n\n659\n00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.940\nWas that by accident?\n\n660\n00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.120\nWas it on purpose?\n\n661\n00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.980\nWas somebody in a position that\nwas able to manipulate that,\n\n662\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.790\ntaking advantage of those settings and\nworking between them?\n\n663\n00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.720\nThere's all these things that can add to\nthe complexity in Cloud and virtualized\n\n664\n00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.420\nenvironments that we just don't deal with\nin traditional environments normally.\n\n665\n00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.637\nI'm not saying there isn't software\ndefining that goes on in non-Cloud,\n\n666\n00:30:24.637 --> 00:30:25.900\nnon-virtualized environments.\n\n667\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.960\nAnd I'm not saying we don't\nhave high levels of automation.\n\n668\n00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.866\nAll that stuff exists, but it may not be\nas complex as it would be if we add Cloud\n\n669\n00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:35.772\nand virtualization of the mix,\nis all I'm suggesting.\n\n670\n00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:39.846\nAnd as a result, we have to worry\nabout that and take that into account.\n\n671\n00:30:39.846 --> 00:30:43.260\nCloud-based forensics, and\nvirtualization-based forensics\n\n672\n00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.030\nis a whole separate area today that\nrequires additional knowledge and\n\n673\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.250\nadditional skill sets to execute properly.\n\n674\n00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.170\nMuch, much more involved\ntraditionally than what we talk about\n\n675\n00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.020\noften just in the scope of\nour conversations here.\n\n676\n00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.040\nAnd a very interesting one, right?\n\n677\n00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.220\nWe spend a lot working in those areas,\nbut a very difficult one,\n\n678\n00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.570\na lot of challenges there.\n\n679\n00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.170\n&gt;&gt; That’s right.\n\n680\n00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.065\nObviously, this is one,\nI’m having a lot of fun,\n\n681\n00:31:03.065 --> 00:31:04.580\nhopefully you’re having a lot of fun.\n\n682\n00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.480\nAnd we're just getting warmed up,\na lot of good conversation going on here.\n\n683\n00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.950\nBut unfortunately, our clock is telling us\nthat we have to do yet another episode.\n\n684\n00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.060\nSo poor us.\n[LAUGH] But hopefully,\n\n685\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.840\nyou guys will join us back for that one.\n\n686\n00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.945\nAs for this, I guess it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n687\n00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:19.120\nThanks for watching.\n\n688\n00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.750\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n689\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.940\n&gt;&gt; I am, who am I?\n\n690\n00:31:22.940 -->

00:00:08.102\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:12.126\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:14.047\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.660\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.782\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:23.470\nin today's episode we are continuing\nin our CHFR Version 9 series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.760\nAnd of course, joining us back in\nthe studio to continue our conversation\n\n10\n00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.690\non network forensics, the forensic man\nhimself, our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.570\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.400\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nHopefully going well for all of you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.780\nGonna continue our conversations.\n\n15\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.280\nPart three, as they say.\n\n16\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.401\nBecause part two, well,\njust wasn't good enough.\n\n17\n00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We had more stuff to talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:42.295\nSo, we're gonna jump back in.\n\n19\n00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.740\nWe left off talking about correlation and\nthe approaches to correlation.\n\n20\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.680\nEvent correlation is the idea of\ntaking events along a timeline and\n\n21\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.510\nrelating them in some way to things\nthat we're looking to investigate or\n\n22\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.160\nprove may or may not have happened.\n\n23\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.400\nSo we lay down the thought process around\ndefining event correlation at the very end\n\n24\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700\nof our last episode.\n\n25\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.740\nBut we do wanna take a look\nat different approaches.\n\n26\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.860\nThere are many different correlation\napproaches that can be used, so\n\n27\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.418\nI thought we'd share a list with you.\n\n28\n00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:09.130\nIf you wanna throw the list up here for\nme, we'll take a look.\n\n29\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.667\nSo you can see here, we have graph-based,\nneural network-based, codebook-based,\n\n30\n00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:14.930\nrule-based, etc.\n\n31\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.110\nWe'll just go through quickly and talk\nabout the definitions among them here and\n\n32\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.930\njust make sure we understand the logic.\n\n33\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.010\nI would say that\n\n34\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.230\nprobably wanna be thinking about\nthese in two-fold, two ways.\n\n35\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.990\nNumber one, certainly,\nwith regards to exam perpetration.\n\n36\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.460\nYou never know when you may get asked\nabout different correlation approaches.\n\n37\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.130\nPerhaps have to grab them out of a list,\nmix and match, drag and drop.\n\n38\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.810\nYou may have to define\na correlation approach based on its\n\n39\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.490\nuse in a word problem to solve,\nor to identify.\n\n40\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.380\nSo there's lot of ways I could\nsee being asked about this.\n\n41\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.630\nAlso obviously, in the real world,\nas you apply this knowledge,\n\n42\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.370\nimportant to know that different\ntools that you may use.\n\n43\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.190\nLog management programs, for instance,\nmay use correlation approaches or\n\n44\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.620\ncorrelation engines, and\nyou wanna be aware of those approaches.\n\n45\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.670\nSo graph-based.\n\n46\n00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.520\nWe graph out each node as a component.\n\n47\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.625\nAnd we kind of look at the dependencies\namong and between them so\n\n48\n00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.258\nwe can look at visual mapping and\nrepresentation of how systems connect to\n\n49\n00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.250\neach other as a graph-based\ncorrelation approach.\n\n50\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.460\nNeural network-based.\n\n51\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.230\nWe use neural networks to detect\nanomalies, root cause failures,\n\n52\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.280\nthings like that.\n\n53\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.840\nSo we're looking at\nthe actual data stream and\n\n54\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.800\nlooking at the ways in which we may\nfind anomalies based on those things.\n\n55\n00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.380\nAny of these modern data\naggregation engines, SEM systems,\n\n56\n00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.870\nthings of that nature, would use\ncorrelation approaches to examine data,\n\n57\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.320\nlooking for patterns that may not\nseem obvious on the surface as well.\n\n58\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.110\nSo you see this in a lot of\ndifferent technology today,\n\n59\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.540\nnot just necessarily in network forensics.\n\n60\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.985\nBut any kind of a SEM system\nwould use this approach as well.\n\n61\n00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:49.130\nCodebook-based.\n\n62\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.760\nWe use codebooks to store sets\nof events and correlate them.\n\n63\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.400\nThink of that as almost being\nlike an extended log where\n\n64\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.340\nwe have lots of different references,\nor information in different buckets, and\n\n65\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.135\nwe can then correlate between them based\non filtering and things of that nature.\n\n66\n00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:03.992\nRule-based.\n\n67\n00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:07.846\nLet me just scroll down here so\nwe can see these.\n\n68\n00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.442\nBring up the, did I go past rule?\n\n69\n00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:11.345\nYes, I did.\n\n70\n00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:12.696\nThere we go.\n\n71\n00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.576\nWent one too far.\n\n72\n00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:14.638\nSo rule-based, right?\n\n73\n00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:16.560\nThis is almost like a firewall, right?\n\n74\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.760\nDoes filtering, we're looking at\ncondition action based on rules.\n\n75\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.109\nDoes this information match this criteria,\nyes or no?\n\n76\n00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.588\nIf it does, put it over here on the right,\nunder positive.\n\n77\n00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.590\nIf not, ignore it, and put it on the left.\n\n78\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.660\nThat kind of thing.\n\n79\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.910\nSo we're looking at just different\nways we can actualize, or\n\n80\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.576\ndifferent ways that these\nactivities may actually occur.\n\n81\n00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:35.642\nField-Based.\n\n82\n00:03:35.642 --> 00:03:39.125\nSpecific events are compared within single\nor multiple fields of the normalized data.\n\n83\n00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.235\nThink of this as almost\nlike a string search.\n\n84\n00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:46.195\nWe're looking for specific items,\nperhaps a term or perhaps pieces of\n\n85\n00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:49.865\ninformation that may have been entered,\nand we're gonna correlate based on that.\n\n86\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.430\nAutomated field correlation.\n\n87\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.390\nChecks and compares all fields\nsystematically, looking at positive and\n\n88\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.020\nnegative matches.\n\n89\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.180\nSo we can correlate\nacross multiple fields.\n\n90\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.660\nThis is just going to be an additional\n\n91\n00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.280\ncapability associated with\nour field based up above.\n\n92\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.180\nWe just automate the process\nwith some sort of filters or\n\n93\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.090\nsearch parameters that we may indicate or\ninput as we get started, and\n\n94\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.840\nlet the computer essentially\ndo the work for us.\n\n95\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.270\nBecause it's gonna be quicker\nobviously and much more focus on that.\n\n96\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.010\nWe do have pocket parameter and\nor payload correlation.\n\n97\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.650\nWe use this to look to particular\npackets in relation to others.\n\n98\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.320\nSo we make a list of packets that seem\nsuspicious or perhaps are interesting\n\n99\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.500\nbased on some sort of variable or some\nsort of parameter we may want to find.\n\n100\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.020\nShow me all Apple packets.\n\n101\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.109\nShow me all SPX/IPX packets.\n\n102\n00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:47.570\nAll Novell traffic.\n\n103\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.200\nShow me all streaming media packets.\n\n104\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.827\nYou'll revalidate and or verify different\npacket traces based on parameters and or\n\n105\n00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.905\ntraffic flow, and\nthen we're gonna correlate those.\n\n106\n00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:02.600\nWe may be looking to understand and\nidentify new attack vectors.\n\n107\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.590\nAnd as a result, we may be looking\nat current known attack signatures.\n\n108\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.831\nThink of how Anti-Malware software works,\nhow firewalls work where we have rules, or\n\n109\n00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:12.907\nsignature files we will compare against.\n\n110\n00:05:12.907 --> 00:05:14.247\nAnd payload correlation or\n\n111\n00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.108\npacket parameter correlation\nwill work similar to that.\n\n112\n00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:21.243\nSo we'll profile or finger print based,\nwhere we gather evidence and\n\n113\n00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:24.817\nlook at attack profiles that may\nhave already been created or\n\n114\n00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:26.865\nare going to be loaded into a tool.\n\n115\n00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:30.735\nA lot of times you'll get these more\nadvanced tools that come with a whole set\n\n116\n00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:34.845\nof these precompiled filters based\non prior activity that the vendor\n\n117\n00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:39.195\nhas correlated across thousands, tens,\nhundreds of thousands of events.\n\n118\n00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:41.765\nAnd you'll be able to see all those and\nunderstand those, right?\n\n119\n00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:44.129\nSo we're getting the benefit of those.\n\n120\n00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.682\nVulnerability based, IDS, IPS traffic and\n\n121\n00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:51.430\nevents can be used to\nmanifest attack vectors.\n\n122\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.360\nAnd so we'll be looking for\nknown vulnerabilities, may be\n\n123\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.450\nable to predict attacks based on the\nweakness or vulnerability that is there.\n\n124\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.970\nSo we may scan a system, see there's\nan unpatched hold that we have to address.\n\n125\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.090\nAnd if we don't, we know they we're\nprobably vulnerable to certain\n\n126\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.735\nkinds of traffic.\n\n127\n00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:07.780\nOpen-port.\n\n128\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.678\nSpeaks for itself.\n\n129\n00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:10.460\nWe're looking at ports that are open,\n\n130\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.840\nknowing certain ports may allow certain\ntraffic to occur and or to flow.\n\n131\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.410\nWhat's the value of knowing\nthose ports are open?\n\n132\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.650\nWhat kind of attacks are we going to\nbe subjected to as a result of that?\n\n133\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.470\nThat's the kinda thing\nwe'd want to know about.\n\n134\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.170\nBayesian correlation.\n\n135\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.050\nThis is where we look at, and\nwe essentially predict or\n\n136\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.150\nattempt to predict what may happen\nbased on statistics and probability.\n\n137\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.145\nIt's more of a mathematical approach.\n\n138\n00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:39.085\nWe're looking at the incidence of certain\nactivities and extrapolating those, and\n\n139\n00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:45.825\nsaying based on prior traffic flows,\ncurrent traffic patterns, we can say we\n\n140\n00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:51.335\noften see this kind of behavior recurring\nevery 10,000 packets, or every 30 minutes.\n\n141\n00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:55.105\nOr whatever the time value or\ndata flow rate may be.\n\n142\n00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:58.640\nAnd so we think we'll see this kind\nof activity within the next two hours\n\n143\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.440\nbased on a normal flow.\n\n144\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.270\nWe can then begin to understand and\nessentially zero in on,\n\n145\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.610\nthe kind of activity that may\noccur based on timing, or\n\n146\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.870\nvalues associated with timing and\ntraffic flow.\n\n147\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.427\nTime or Clock Time are role-based.\n\n148\n00:07:11.427 --> 00:07:14.916\nWe look at computer user behavior,\nand we look for anomalies.\n\n149\n00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:18.959\nHey, you're not supposed to be logging\nin after five o'clock in the afternoon,\n\n150\n00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.750\ncuz that's considered\noutside the normal time.\n\n151\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.840\nAnd yet you're logging on at 7 o'clock\nat night, what's going on with that?\n\n152\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.290\nSo sometimes called Temporal, by the way.\n\n153\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.270\nTime or Clock Time are role-based.\n\n154\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.780\nWhen it's time,\nit's also referred to as temporal.\n\n155\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.010\nJust another fancy word for\ntime, just so you know.\n\n156\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.650\nAnd then Route Correlation.\n\n157\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.440\nWe look at attack routes.\n\n158\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.520\nThis is looking at the routing data,\nlooking at the packet headers,\n\n159\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.260\ninformation about that, trying to\nfigure out and ascertain whether or\n\n160\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.980\nnot there may be value\nin that information.\n\n161\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.590\nWho do we send as, where do we send from,\nwho do we send to, over what network,\n\n162\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.720\nover what path, using what protocols,\nwhat IP addresses.\n\n163\n00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.721\nThat kind of stuff, right,\nwould be important for us to assess and\n\n164\n00:07:57.721 --> 00:07:58.478\nto understand.\n\n165\n00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.790\nWas there manipulation of the MAC address?\n\n166\n00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.990\nWas there manipulation of the IP address?\n\n167\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.561\nWas it a A Man-In-The-Middle attack.\n\n168\n00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:10.680\nWas it a spoof or masquerade,\nthese kind of things.\n\n169\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.440\nWe may be able to find some of\nthat based on route correlation.\n\n170\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.300\nEspecially if we see alternative\nroutes that are not normally used,\n\n171\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.580\nthat show up and stand out as red flags.\n\n172\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.150\nSo these are the correlation\nmethods that are often used, so\n\n173\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.300\nwe wanna make sure that we\nare thinking about these.\n\n174\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.890\nAnd just understanding the logic of\nhow correlation engines may work,\n\n175\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.680\nor correlation activities and\napproaches may work.\n\n176\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.550\nAgain, tools will have\ndifferent mechanisms or\n\n177\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.480\nmethods associated with them and\nit's important to think about that.\n\n178\n00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.020\nAnd just have a sense of that\nto understand how it may work.\n\n179\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.440\nSo just keeping that in mind and\nunderstanding that would be valuable.\n\n180\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.090\nI did mention NTP in our last episode.\n\n181\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.550\nI have a couple of registry keys for\n\n182\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.510\nWindows that I just thought I\nwould share with you quickly.\n\n183\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.160\nIf you're setting up NTP and synchronizing\neither to an external source,\n\n184\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.390\nyou may have to manipulate\ncertain registry settings.\n\n185\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.430\nSo if you wanna take a look\nhere real quick with me,\n\n186\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.160\nput those up on the screen for you,\nso you could see what they look like.\n\n187\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.130\nThey're right there.\n\n188\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.630\nSo these two keys spent a lot of time\nin the registry in the operating system\n\n189\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.400\nforensic section.\n\n190\n00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.780\nHKLM is just shorthand for\nHK local machine, right.\n\n191\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.960\nSo the registry high for\nthe local machine.\n\n192\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.200\nSystem current control sets\nservices W32 time parameters.\n\n193\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.960\nThe setting would be type REG_SZ\n\n194\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.350\nvalue NTP then the other one would\nbe the name of the NTP server.\n\n195\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.300\nThat is actually a placeholder,\nby the way, as we often call out.\n\n196\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.452\nWould not be a value you look for here,\nthis, in other words would not be\n\n197\n00:09:31.452 --> 00:09:35.974\nwhere you put it but rather the actual\nname for the NPT server just so you know.\n\n198\n00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.850\nSo just thought I'd point\nthose out to you real quick.\n\n199\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.810\nWith regards to event correlation,\nthought I'd show you a quick tool and\n\n200\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.320\njust show you what an event\nmanager may look like.\n\n201\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.735\nThe GFI EventsManager software package,\nif you haven't seen this before,\n\n202\n00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:54.325\navailable for download as many of the\nsoftware items we demo here are for free.\n\n203\n00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:56.255\nYou can get a 30 day trial license,\n\n204\n00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:58.865\nprovide an email when you go\nto the website and download.\n\n205\n00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.610\nAnd you're able to get a 30 day license,\n\n206\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.075\nthen obviously you have to\nlicense it after the fact.\n\n207\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.838\nBut when you go in,\nwe get status on traffic and\n\n208\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:10.858\ninformation in the logs\nas you can see here.\n\n209\n00:10:10.858 --> 00:10:12.841\nSo we have a nice little dashboard.\n\n210\n00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:17.608\nWe are looking at information color\ncoded here around a variety of events.\n\n211\n00:10:17.608 --> 00:10:21.910\nI am looking at the windows event database\nby the way, so the event logs on Windows.\n\n212\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.700\nThis tools is good for sys logging, so\nit will work with any kind of system,\n\n213\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.035\npull logs from anywhere.\n\n214\n00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:31.937\nYou can see, I can break down events based\non different applications successfully\n\n215\n00:10:31.937 --> 00:10:37.290\ninstalled, user rights assignments change,\ndifferent kinds of categories here.\n\n216\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.690\nTops services, bi events,\nthings like that.\n\n217\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.590\nYou see all the different traffic flows.\n\n218\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.580\nI can see disk space,\nphysical disk condition.\n\n219\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.700\nIt's giving me a breakdown on all\nthe different logs and the entries.\n\n220\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.650\nI can go in,\nmanipulate the time value here.\n\n221\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.050\nI've only been running this for maybe an\nhour or two, just as we're getting ready\n\n222\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.900\nto do shows for you today,\nand just gathering some data.\n\n223\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.240\nSo we're not gonna go back historically.\n\n224\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.310\nYou'd have to be running this tool for\n\n225\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.180\nmultiple days to really\nget a historical trend.\n\n226\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.570\nBut you can obviously see that.\n\n227\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.860\nI can filter and look for\nevents in any one of these areas.\n\n228\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.080\nAnd just click in View Events,\n\n229\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.380\nand It will show me a breakdown of\nevents by category here, brings them up,\n\n230\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.200\nlet's me highlight them and\nlook at the individual field data.\n\n231\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.550\nThis is essentially\nthe Windows event viewer,\n\n232\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.830\nit's just a Windows event viewer with\na lot of additional bells and whistles.\n\n233\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Looks a whole lot nicer too.\n\n234\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's got a better engine,\nbetter presentation obviously, right?\n\n235\n00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.610\nIt looks a little cleaner and it's got\nmore capabilities aside from status.\n\n236\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.550\nI can go in, if I go to General here,\n\n237\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.530\nhere we just see some general information\nversioning on the program itself.\n\n238\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.250\nI could do reporting here, I can go in and\npull reports on any of these areas,\n\n239\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.010\ngives me a little preview on\nhow to pull report obviously.\n\n240\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.680\nValuable for that, so\nI can go in and take a look.\n\n241\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.680\nI can go to event browser, I can see all\nsort of different sorts of different\n\n242\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.210\nstuff, obviously highlighting\nany one of these events.\n\n243\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.140\nAnd I can go in, and I can go,\nfor instance, all critical and\n\n244\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.420\nhigh important events.\n\n245\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.310\nHigh importance events, excuse me.\n\n246\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.180\nHard disk management issues, whatever\nthe case may be, it shows me that.\n\n247\n00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.770\nColor codes them,\nwhich obviously makes sense.\n\n248\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.970\nSo I can go in under Windows events.\n\n249\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.330\nYou'll look at security events,\nlook at the application log, et cetera.\n\n250\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.260\nSo it's got all the same\ninformation we'd see.\n\n251\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.390\nIt's just pulling right\nout of the Windows events.\n\n252\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.300\nUses an OpenSQL database or\nloads a local database on the system.\n\n253\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.840\nYou can access one remotely so\n\n254\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.260\nyou can set this up to be a syslog kind\nof interface and remote out the logs.\n\n255\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.880\nReally up to you to decide.\n\n256\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.032\nWhen you open the tool.\n\n257\n00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:32.130\nLet me just close the tool,\nwe'll bring it up here in just a second.\n\n258\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.130\nLet me just minimize,\nwe'll bring this back up.\n\n259\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.970\nJust go to my start menu,\nI have it pinned right here.\n\n260\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.630\nI installed it on my Windows 10 machine,\ncould run this on.\n\n261\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.031\nOne of the reasons I like this tool,\nyou run it on a workstation or a server.\n\n262\n00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.780\nSo you could run this on any kind of\nWindows system, going back to Windows 7,\n\n263\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.582\nall the way forward to Windows 10.\n\n264\n00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:52.950\nYou can run this on the server side,\nso server '12, server '16.\n\n265\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.997\nYou can run it on just about any platform\nin the Windows family, which is nice.\n\n266\n00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:58.825\nSo I just pinned it to\nthe start menu here.\n\n267\n00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:04.280\nJust wanna show you when I start it up\nreal quick, as soon as this opens up,\n\n268\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.790\nwe get a little handy wizard, aside from\nthe hey, you have to buy the licensing,\n\n269\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.730\nwhich obviously we know about,\nwe'll click through that.\n\n270\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.960\nBut we have a little nice\nGFI events manager wizard,\n\n271\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.940\nhey, where do you wanna go,\nwhat do you wanna do?\n\n272\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.170\nBrowse events, which is where I just was.\n\n273\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.520\nDo I wanna generate some reports?\n\n274\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.930\nTakes me out to there.\n\n275\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.520\nDo I wanna view the dashboard, right?\n\n276\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.710\nSo I can view the dashboard or\ncustomize, so we go to view dashboard.\n\n277\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.550\nJust click there.\n\n278\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.380\nIt gives me an overall heads up about\n28 almost 29,000 events that have been\n\n279\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.250\nrecorded, so far over two event sources,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n280\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.660\nSo I can go in, and\njust click on anything I want.\n\n281\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.070\nYou see the dashboards in\nthe back here as you saw.\n\n282\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.080\nBrowse events, generate reports,\nif I click browse events, it'll change and\n\n283\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.880\njust bring me to where I was, right?\n\n284\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.490\nSo, I can go in and\nI can take a look at any of these.\n\n285\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.751\nThis is my general dashboard,\nas I already showed you.\n\n286\n00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:52.684\nBut it is nice because I can go in and\n\n287\n00:13:52.684 --> 00:13:55.750\nI can also change the way\nthat I view the information.\n\n288\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:01.470\nYou'll see here, bars is what I'm looking\nat right now, but I have 3D, I have areas.\n\n289\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.890\nI have all sorts of stuff stacked 3D.\n\n290\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:09.380\nSo if I do lines 3D gives me the nice\nlittle spacial graph representation.\n\n291\n00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.250\nSo I can actually manipulate the data,\npresent it in a lot of different ways.\n\n292\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.720\nSo this is not a tool necessarily\nthat is a forensic investigator,\n\n293\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.050\nwe would always and\nhave access to on the system prior.\n\n294\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.270\nVery likely we would not\nas a matter of fact.\n\n295\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.700\nBut I like the tool because it does\nallow me, if I'm using the tool,\n\n296\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.860\nto extract the data from systems\nthat are being investigated and\n\n297\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.350\nthen present it historically in a variety\nof different ways that I can then use to\n\n298\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.560\ngenerate reports and\nthen show what we find.\n\n299\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.690\nSo, the analysis capabilities,\nthe data visualization capabilities,\n\n300\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.120\nare what we're going after here,\nwith a tool like this,\n\n301\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.254\nas opposed to the real time\nmonitoring capabilities.\n\n302\n00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:47.990\nBecause it's very unlikely that we would\nhave access to this data in real time on\n\n303\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.951\na targeted system that's been attacked,\nunless we happen to trip across a customer\n\n304\n00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:55.104\nwho may be running this,\nin which case obviously it's valuable.\n\n305\n00:14:55.104 --> 00:14:59.120\nBut the value to us as an investigator\ntraditionally in a tool like this, is\n\n306\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.020\nusually to use it to load static data from\nsystems that are captured after the fact.\n\n307\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.940\nAnd then visualize and analyze that data.\n\n308\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.587\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n309\n00:15:08.587 --> 00:15:12.997\nBut when we talk about event correlation,\nwe're talking about engines like this and\n\n310\n00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:16.765\nskills and capabilities that these\nkind of tools may provide to us.\n\n311\n00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:20.135\nAnd log management capabilities\nare really what we're looking at here.\n\n312\n00:15:20.135 --> 00:15:23.035\nTo that end, let's think about log\nmanagement for a couple minutes.\n\n313\n00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:25.955\nWe think about log management, we're\nthinking about all the things that go\n\n314\n00:15:25.955 --> 00:15:30.632\ninto understanding what data is in a log,\nwhat it looks like, what it may be,\n\n315\n00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:32.632\nwhere it is, how we manage it.\n\n316\n00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:34.442\nAll those kind of things\nare part of what we have to do.\n\n317\n00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:36.522\nThink about Log Parsing,\n\n318\n00:15:36.522 --> 00:15:39.962\nthe idea of being able to extract data\nfrom the logs is what we talk about.\n\n319\n00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:43.832\nEvent Filtering as you saw we could do,\nI just demonstrated that with the tool.\n\n320\n00:15:43.832 --> 00:15:47.632\nEvent Aggregation, the tool aggregates,\nbrings all the data together.\n\n321\n00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:51.302\nThis tool is aggregating right now\njust from the local Windows logs on my\n\n322\n00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:52.440\nWindows 10 machine.\n\n323\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.522\nBut as we set it up,\nwe have the ability to go out and\n\n324\n00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:55.918\ngrab data from alternate feeds.\n\n325\n00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:59.338\nThat syslog capability or\nSEM capability that we often talk about or\n\n326\n00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:02.521\nSEMI guess depending on where you are and\nhow you pronounce it.\n\n327\n00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:05.443\nA log rotation,\nlog compression, log archiving.\n\n328\n00:16:05.443 --> 00:16:09.247\nAll different ways we deal with\nthe storage of the log information.\n\n329\n00:16:09.247 --> 00:16:12.692\nDeduping and reducing the log data,\nso we filter out recurrent events so\n\n330\n00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:14.880\nwe can see an accurate representation.\n\n331\n00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.470\nSo we call that log reduction.\n\n332\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.090\nLog normalization.\n\n333\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.410\nLog file integrity.\n\n334\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.480\nSo, we're applying hashing\nto create file integrity.\n\n335\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.240\nWe talked about event correlation.\n\n336\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.470\nViewing, reporting, clearing.\n\n337\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.460\nThese are all activities associated with\nlog management, and we wanna be thinking\n\n338\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.800\nabout those, and have a sense of those and\nunderstand them for what they are.\n\n339\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.120\nAnother way to look at logs,\nyou'll wanna join me here,\n\n340\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.800\nwe'll just take a look at another view\nof a kind of a system that does this.\n\n341\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.510\nI'm on a server 12 right now,\nVM as you can see up here.\n\n342\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.620\nWe often demo across different OSs\nto show you different capabilities.\n\n343\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.900\nXPO Log,\nanother program that you can load.\n\n344\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.760\nYou'll see this as a web-based interface.\n\n345\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.410\nI'm using Internet Explorer\non the local machine,\n\n346\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.790\nconnecting to a secure URL port 30303,\non the local\n\n347\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:05.290\nhost to present this information in\na web-enabled API, a web-enabled app.\n\n348\n00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.863\nAgain, just another log viewer,\nanother aggregation engine I'm looking at,\n\n349\n00:17:08.863 --> 00:17:11.110\nas you could see the Windows\nevent logs here.\n\n350\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.361\nSo, I'm looking at log information for\nthe security log in particular.\n\n351\n00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:17.551\nSo I'm just presenting it and\nI'm showing it here.\n\n352\n00:17:17.551 --> 00:17:20.819\nI have filtering capabilities,\naction capabilities.\n\n353\n00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.304\nThis tool also does\na complete sys log solution.\n\n354\n00:17:23.304 --> 00:17:25.957\nYou can pull tools and\ntheir logs in from different systems.\n\n355\n00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:28.864\nJust another vision of the same tool,\njust by a different company,\n\n356\n00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:30.960\nessentially does the same kinda thing.\n\n357\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.417\nI can take any one of these entries here,\nas you see,\n\n358\n00:17:34.417 --> 00:17:38.279\nCopy, Filter, etc,\nAdd to a data capture, Customize.\n\n359\n00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:42.744\nI could export out into multiple\nformats as you see, XML, CSV,\n\n360\n00:17:42.744 --> 00:17:46.480\ntab delimited raw data so\nI can interact with it.\n\n361\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.480\nI can change the view here,\ngo from list view to tab view.\n\n362\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.900\nObviously, a little bit harder to\nread the data in this kind of a form.\n\n363\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.090\nIt may be a little bit\neasier to see it here.\n\n364\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.400\nBut I can go back and forth.\n\n365\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.630\nI can modify.\n\n366\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.670\nI can look at different logs.\n\n367\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.250\nThis is the application log\ninstead of the security log.\n\n368\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.220\nSame idea here.\n\n369\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.420\nI can create monitors.\n\n370\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.960\nI have a Tomcat monitor capability here.\n\n371\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.601\nWebSphere, WebLogic, you know\nthere's a lot of different APIs and\n\n372\n00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:15.570\nconnections out to pretty\nstandardized data sources.\n\n373\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.660\nAnd in many systems today, cross platform,\nthis would be a great example of a cross\n\n374\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.400\nplatform tool as is GFI, as opposed\nto a same OS, or same platform tool.\n\n375\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.200\nWindows event viewer would\nbe a same platform tool,\n\n376\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.370\nreally limited to looking at\nevent logs from Windows systems.\n\n377\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.960\nThese kind of enterprise tools\nare cross-platform capable.\n\n378\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.182\nAgain, a 30-day trial license here.\n\n379\n00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:40.610\nDownload, configure, and\nthen of course use as needed.\n\n380\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.690\nSo, just thinking about different\nways we can understand and\n\n381\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.530\nsee this kind of data,\nhow we would capture it.\n\n382\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.810\nAnother tool that may be valuable for\nus, just while we're here.\n\n383\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.850\nLet me just minimize my notes here for\na second.\n\n384\n00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.170\nThis is a tool that hopefully\nyou're familiar with.\n\n385\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.960\nGot a little shark fin going on, right.\n\n386\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.690\nSo used to call this\nthing Ethereal years ago.\n\n387\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.640\nLately, we call it Wireshark.\n\n388\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.960\nAnd if you're not familiar with Wireshark,\nyou could see it as a network packet\n\n389\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.710\ncapture tool on along the lines\nof Windows Network Monitor.\n\n390\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.510\nThe network analyzer\nfrom Network Chemistry.\n\n391\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.120\nA lot of different programs that do this.\n\n392\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.950\nI've been running it since we started,\n\n393\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.550\nyou can just see traffic\nis streaming through here.\n\n394\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.900\nRight, we're looking at\nindividual data packets.\n\n395\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.583\nAnd whatever it may be,\nSTP, PTP, L2TP, ARP, etc.\n\n396\n00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:31.091\nSee all the different\ntraffic coming through here?\n\n397\n00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:35.490\nIf we just grab randomly a packet,\nI think I got.\n\n398\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.170\nWhoops, I thought I got.\n\n399\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.170\nThere, got the ARP packet,\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n400\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.150\nIt's like fishing for\napples in a barrel, right?\n\n401\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So you could see,\nI could obviously stop the capture, and\n\n402\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.490\nI could then filter and\npull it if I wanted to.\n\n403\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.160\nBut I'm just letting it go and\n\n404\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.340\njust acquiring data just to show\nyou it's running in real time.\n\n405\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.385\nYou know, we got our time.\n\n406\n00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:57.590\nIt's been running for about 8,300\nseconds so far, so it's been running for\n\n407\n00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.640\nsome time now.\n\n408\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.820\nThere's our data frames, our numbers.\n\n409\n00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.220\nBut you could\n\n410\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.910\nsee here I've got close to about 760,000\npackets that I've captured so far.\n\n411\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.260\nBut you can see as we open\nany one of these packets,\n\n412\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.160\nwe can tell information about it.\n\n413\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.570\nWe've been through packets\nin depth in other shows.\n\n414\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.600\nI'm not gonna spend a lot of time\ntearing down a packet for you now.\n\n415\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.330\nBut what I just wanna show you quickly is,\nlet me just move this down a little bit so\n\n416\n00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.440\nyou can kinda see what we have here.\n\n417\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.490\nYou're depending on the protocol,\nobviously, and what we're seeing.\n\n418\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.140\nThe data in the packet will be varied and\nwill give us a lot of information.\n\n419\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.900\nBut, I do see that it\nis an Ethernet packet.\n\n420\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.640\nI see source and destination information.\n\n421\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.470\nI do see the type.\n\n422\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.910\nI see if there is any padding.\n\n423\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.360\nI can see, of course,\nthe protocol that's used, so IPv4.\n\n424\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:49.250\nI could see Mac address information in\nthe case of ARP, and IP information.\n\n425\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.290\nI do see both,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n426\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.060\nSo it does give me some correlatable,\nsome event information,\n\n427\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.820\nthat may be transferable to other\nareas as I'm doing my analysis.\n\n428\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.460\nBut ARP by itself obviously isn't enough,\nright?\n\n429\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.470\nI need other packets and\nother kinds of data.\n\n430\n00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.670\nSo something like this may\nprovide more information, right?\n\n431\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.760\nPrecision time protocol, right?\n\n432\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.630\nUDP as well as IP and TCP, so\nI may have more information in here.\n\n433\n00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.040\nWe see quite a bit of this traffic, so\n\n434\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.410\nI may wanna look at it and\nsee what's going on with it.\n\n435\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.000\nAnd I can see that there's\nmore information in here\n\n436\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.710\nthat may be valuable just as I\nscroll down, as you can see.\n\n437\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.130\nAnd I'm just opening it up so you can\nsee some of the stuff that's in here.\n\n438\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.100\nSo I've got Clock Identity,\nthis is a time synchronization packet.\n\n439\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.580\nSo I've got time information in here,\nwhich again would be valuable for\n\n440\n00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.220\nme if I'm trying to correlate log data\nwith events that are happening, right?\n\n441\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.290\nSo doing network captures is important,\nbut, again, keep in mind it's very rare\n\n442\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.660\nthat as a forensic investigator, I'm gonna\nbe having access to this live data feed,\n\n443\n00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.350\nrunning it before the event occurred,\nseeing it during, and certainly after.\n\n444\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.940\nThis is not traditionally what CHFI,\n\n445\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.440\nwhat incidence response\nwith forensics would do.\n\n446\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.370\nThis is simply something that may be\ngoing on, on the network already,\n\n447\n00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.880\nthat we may be able to take advantage\nof by getting captures after the fact.\n\n448\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.470\nOften, there are packet monitors\nthat are running in real time or\n\n449\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.420\nat least may run from time to time as we\nhave various activities taking place.\n\n450\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.280\nSo it's always important for\nus to be aware of the fact.\n\n451\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.160\nWe may find this traffic and\nsee it reactively after the fact, but\n\n452\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.350\nprobably not live and\n\n453\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.730\ncertainly very highly unlikely that\nwe would have access to this data.\n\n454\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.510\n&gt;&gt; I can only imagine the excitement of\na CHFI, sitting there, realizing that\n\n455\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.840\nthey're catching someone with their hand\nin the cookie jar at that point in time.\n\n456\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That would be very exciting.\n\n457\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.080\n&gt;&gt; You may.\n\n458\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.830\nNot yourself, in other words not me,\nbut the person who controls the IDSIP\n\n459\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.930\ninfrastructure, person that controls\nthe firewall infrastructure, the routers.\n\n460\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.910\nThere's usually of logging that takes\nplace on these devices as just the normal,\n\n461\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.180\nstandard practice.\n\n462\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.500\nWe just showed you some\nevent correlation software.\n\n463\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.340\nMost IDPS capabilities will have\nlive data capturing going on.\n\n464\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.110\nMost SEM systems are aggregating logs\noff systems today in near real-time.\n\n465\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.560\nSo we would see real-time traffic\nflows that we could report against and\n\n466\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.140\nhave access to, but\nwe'd see them after the event, right?\n\n467\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Data may have been captured\n\n468\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.130\nin real time but we won't look at it in\nreal time cuz that's just not our job.\n\n469\n00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.230\nIt's not what we do.\n\n470\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.730\nSo we just have to think about\nthe logic of that, understand that, and\n\n471\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.790\nmake sure in our minds that we're aware\nof that because that is important\n\n472\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.820\nas a distinction, something we have\nto think about and be aware of.\n\n473\n00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.380\nWe often come to this data second-hand,\nafter the fact.\n\n474\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.030\nWe have to then take time to\nvalidate through due care and\n\n475\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.690\ndue diligence the integrity and\nthe viability of the data.\n\n476\n00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.980\nWe have to correlate it back\nto events that have occurred,\n\n477\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.730\nand then we have to make sure that we\nunderstand what that data's telling us,\n\n478\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.420\nand this is all very important.\n\n479\n00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.330\nWhen we think about that,\n\n480\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.660\nyou may have seen in the notes as\nI flashed them up on the screen.\n\n481\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.480\nWe'll put them back up.\n\n482\n00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.465\nYou could look at this from\nthe Linux perspective.\n\n483\n00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:49.020\nI also gave you a list here of common\nWindows Event ID's, as I did in\n\n484\n00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.560\nsome of the other episodes we did in the\noperating systems forensics discussion.\n\n485\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.440\nWe had a bunch of Windows IDs from the\nevent viewer that would be correlatable.\n\n486\n00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.800\nSo you just wanna take note of those.\n\n487\n00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.473\nI'll scroll down and you'll see them\nin the notes there in a minute.\n\n488\n00:23:59.473 --> 00:24:03.072\nBut on the Linux side, if we're doing\nthis just like we do in Windows,\n\n489\n00:24:03.072 --> 00:24:05.817\nwe have to track commands\nthat are executed by users.\n\n490\n00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:09.543\nWe talked about the history key, for\ninstance, and the equivalent dos key in\n\n491\n00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:14.100\nWindows, and talked about all that in the\noperating system forensics conversations.\n\n492\n00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.680\nPulling the batch history file, making\nsure we understand what's going on there.\n\n493\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.510\nIf you haven't seen those episodes, really\nencourage you to go back, take a look.\n\n494\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.120\nWe did six parts on OS forensics.\n\n495\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.710\nQuite a bit of information.\n\n496\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.370\nFew of them were pretty in depth,\nhands on, looking at a lot of\n\n497\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.570\nthe things we could do in the Windows\nsystem in terms of registry manipulation,\n\n498\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.020\nthings like that,\nlot of good information there.\n\n499\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.790\nWhere logs are found your var adm,\nvar log, user adm, among many,\n\n500\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.050\nmany other areas.\n\n501\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.950\nI gave you a nice word document\ntable with all the different In log.\n\n502\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.640\nAreas and entries that you would wanna\nlook at in Linux, also on the Mac OS.\n\n503\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.720\nGave you some supporting\ndocumentation there.\n\n504\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.640\nBe good for you to go back,\n\n505\n00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.280\nreference all that,\njust make sure that you're aware of that.\n\n506\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.950\nThe lastcomm command can also\nbe used along with history and\n\n507\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.400\nthings like that, right?\n\n508\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.810\nWe talked about parsing the batch\nhistory file with the tail command\n\n509\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.440\nto see the last so many entries.\n\n510\n00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.620\nLot of different ways you could do that.\n\n511\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.100\nJust reminding you of that.\n\n512\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.340\nWe talked about common\nWindows security event IDs.\n\n513\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.070\nThere's a whole bunch listed here.\n\n514\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.390\nYou can read the shownotes to\nget a sense of what they are,\n\n515\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.360\nbut try to give you the most common ones\nspecific to the security events, just so\n\n516\n00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.230\nthat you know what they are and,\nobviously, have a sense of them.\n\n517\n00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:23.130\nWouldn't be any good conversation on\nlogging and network forensics if we don't\n\n518\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.320\ntalk about sys logging in both the Linux,\nUnix world as well as the Windows world.\n\n519\n00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.460\nAnd you can see Syslogging there and\nhow it is set up.\n\n520\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.390\nRight the idea that the client server\nsolution is used to be able to send and\n\n521\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.160\nreceive logs.\n\n522\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.340\nToday more and more, you know,\n\n523\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.600\nSyslog is kind of the old school way of\nkind of talking about this and doing this.\n\n524\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.620\nNot that we don't still do Syslogging,\nit's used very often.\n\n525\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.480\nBut a more modern interpretation\nof that would be SIEM right,\n\n526\n00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.310\nSecurity Information Event Management,\nSIEM systems.\n\n527\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.630\nAnd the ideas the same its just that their\na little bit newer they have more BI,\n\n528\n00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.800\nbusiness intelligence, data visualization,\n\n529\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.440\ndata analytics capabilities as opposed to\nolder traditional sys logging systems,\n\n530\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.850\nwhich really would have been just\nglorified file managers thatgave you basic\n\n531\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.665\nfiltering capabilities across multiple\nlogs that were archived or stored.\n\n532\n00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:13.770\nSome systems are more active, more\ninteraction and more capable today but\n\n533\n00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.440\nWe still use both systems extensively,\nso just be aware of the concept.\n\n534\n00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.780\nBoth the syslog and protocol and\nthe ability to send and\n\n535\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.910\nreceive those messages and transport them\nand store them is what syslog refers to.\n\n536\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.250\nWould you send these traditionally\nusing syslogging anyway\n\n537\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.690\nin clear text which is one of\nthe downside of using syslogs,\n\n538\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.680\nas opposed to send systems which\nmay encrypt their traffic.\n\n539\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.180\nSo, just something to be aware of.\n\n540\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.610\nBut, we do have the daemon\nof the servicer syslog.\n\n541\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.210\nTraditionally /etc/syslogd\nis where you'll see that.\n\n542\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.240\nAnd the config file,\n\n543\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.770\nas is the case in all Linux Unix systems,\nwe always have a something .conf file\n\n544\n00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.410\nto configure whatever that may be\n/etc/syslog.conf is where we'll find that.\n\n545\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.150\nListens traditionally on UDP Port 514,\nbut that could be varied and\n\n546\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.440\nmanipulated based on localization,\nsecurity parameters, things like that.\n\n547\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.170\nBut traditionally we would see sys\nlogging incurring on port 514.\n\n548\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.250\nJust make sure you're aware of\nthose things as we talk about this.\n\n549\n00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.860\nThere are a lot of different log entries\nthat we find from different systems\n\n550\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.710\ncoming into a different areas,\nright we will find for\n\n551\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.890\ninstance logging in IIS for\nthe web servers in Windows.\n\n552\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.290\nWe've talked about that a little\nbit in a web forensic solution but\n\n553\n00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.690\nwe certainly see those there.\n\n554\n00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.770\nThose logs are gonna be ascii text\nbased and we have to deal with those.\n\n555\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.760\nThere's logging on DHCP, logging for\n\n556\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.760\nDNS all sort of services and\nsystems will provide logging.\n\n557\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.350\nJust make sure you're aware of that,\njust so you understand the logic of that.\n\n558\n00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.050\nHave to think about log integrity and\n\n559\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.640\nconfidentiality when we're\nthinking about logging.\n\n560\n00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.510\nHow do we provide for that?\n\n561\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.350\nWe've been talking a lot about that, and\n\n562\n00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.660\njust the need to associate\nour thought process there.\n\n563\n00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.190\nSo it's very important for\nus to be thinking about those things, and\n\n564\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.720\nunderstand the logic of where they are.\n\n565\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.100\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n566\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.570\nAnd you know again, just thinking\nabout that as we go through and\n\n567\n00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.942\nwe understand the logic of just you know,\n\n568\n00:28:03.942 --> 00:28:07.470\nsys logging, logging across\nall the different events, etc.\n\n569\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.470\nWe want to be thinking about\nthe fact that we are, hello!\n\n570\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.620\nI always look so\nnice when I come up on camera like that.\n\n571\n00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.910\nI'm always excited to see myself.\n\n572\n00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.550\nThat's cool.\n\n573\n00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.580\nSo just think about the fact\nthat as I said integrity and\n\n574\n00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.070\nconfidentiality, very important concerns\nwhen we're thinking about logging.\n\n575\n00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.240\nAnd the validation of those\nlogs most importantly.\n\n576\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.740\nWe're talking about, of course.\n\n577\n00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.600\nForensic, forensic examination of data and\nwe have to think about the fact\n\n578\n00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.250\nthat when we are doing this, it's not\nenough just to say, hey here's the log.\n\n579\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:33.970\nIt's all good, right?\n\n580\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.400\nAnd I hand the log to Daniel.\n\n581\n00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.910\nDaniel has no idea where\nthe log's coming from.\n\n582\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:37.960\nHe knows it's coming from me but\n\n583\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.510\nhe has no idea what I did with\nit before I gave it to him.\n\n584\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.890\nSo we have to make sure that we\nare validating the integrity and\n\n585\n00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.180\nthe confidentiality around\nthat information grab.\n\n586\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.360\nRemember chain of custody,\nvery important as a concept.\n\n587\n00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.780\nKeep coming back to that idea.\n\n588\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.340\nGotta make sure we're keeping an eye\non that stuff and have a sense of that.\n\n589\n00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.600\nAnd as we present that documentary\nevidence, whatever it is, a log capture,\n\n590\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.280\na rendering of a visualization\nof the data based on a flow and\n\n591\n00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.590\neven correlation shown you different\nways we could do those things.\n\n592\n00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.300\nWe have to be able to speak\nauthoritatively, intelligently but\n\n593\n00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.990\nalso to ensure that we have the proper\nbackup, the proper documentation,\n\n594\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.355\nthe proper proof to validate\nthat that data has integrity.\n\n595\n00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:19.255\nAnd has confidentiality associated\nwith it, if that's important.\n\n596\n00:29:19.255 --> 00:29:23.155\nOf the two most likely, the integrity is\nthe more important of the two things we\n\n597\n00:29:23.155 --> 00:29:25.795\nfocus on with regards to\nthe validity of logs.\n\n598\n00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:29.215\nSo we have to be able to really\nascertain beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n599\n00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:31.785\nthat the data has not been\nmodified without consent and\n\n600\n00:29:31.785 --> 00:29:36.255\nknowledge of the system owners and/or\nthe controllers along the way.\n\n601\n00:29:36.255 --> 00:29:38.375\nAnd if we can validate that,\nwe can present that,\n\n602\n00:29:38.375 --> 00:29:40.570\nas we talked about under\nthe federal rules of evidence.\n\n603\n00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.880\nRemember rule 803, if that's in question,\nchances are good that data may not be\n\n604\n00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.490\nallowed to be presented in a case or\nin a court of law.\n\n605\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.830\nThat doesn't mean we can't use it for\noutside of the courtroom for\n\n606\n00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.510\ninvestigations that may\nnot end in a trial.\n\n607\n00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.900\nBut it means that we would not be able\nto legally present that evidence in\n\n608\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.880\na court of law.\n\n609\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.200\nSo remember administrative events or\n\n610\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.730\nadministrative investigations\nthat occur inside the company\n\n611\n00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.560\nthat may not go into a court may have very\ndifferent standards for burdens of proof.\n\n612\n00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.340\nBecause we don't have to validate\nthe data at the same level.\n\n613\n00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.590\nIt doesn't mean we just simply\nwalk away from data validation and\n\n614\n00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.430\nsay, well best effort, I think it's okay.\n\n615\n00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.060\nBut you know there's all this evidence\nof somebody tampering over here but\n\n616\n00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.290\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n617\n00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.990\nWe have to make that clear to the client\nbut the bar, the burden of proof, may or\n\n618\n00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.050\nmay not be at the same level.\n\n619\n00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.350\nIt really depends on the nature\nof the circumstances and\n\n620\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.710\nthe investigation that's taking place so\njust keep that in mind as well.\n\n621\n00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.000\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nLogging is an extremely important aspect\n\n622\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.180\nof our jobs not as just sys devices.\n\n623\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.730\nAnybody inside of IT in general we've\ngot to turn on the logging systems so\n\n624\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.630\nthat we can see the events\nthat have occurred.\n\n625\n00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.460\nAnd then it's up to us as CHFI to\ninterpret that data, be able to find\n\n626\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.480\nmaybe the fact that there has been an\nincident that has occurred and used that.\n\n627\n00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.980\nAnd then present that and keep the\nintegrity of the data so that you can take\n\n628\n00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.710\nit court if necessary or just to present\nit to someone that's hired you for, maybe,\n\n629\n00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.240\nfiring purposes or corrective\nmeasures as they need to take them.\n\n630\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.660\nThat being said.\n\n631\n00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.600\nImportance of logging can't be\nunderstated or can't be overstated,\n\n632\n00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.219\nshould I say- Because-\n&gt;&gt; It can be understated.\n\n633\n00:31:05.219 --> 00:31:06.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be understated.\n\n634\n00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.050\nIt can't be overstated.\n\n635\n00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:07.820\n&gt;&gt; It can't be overstated.\n\n636\n00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Because we're getting ready to do\na whole nother episode, more on logging.\n\n637\n00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.890\nSo, come back for that next episode.\n\n638\n00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:12.780\nIt's gonna be great.\n\n639\n00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.510\nIt is important stuff for us to know.\n\n640\n00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.210\nThat being said, it is time for\nus to sign off for\n\n641\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.600\nthis episode For ITPRO.TV,\nI've been

00:00:08.379\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.325\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:13.592\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.250\nAnd welcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.190\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode is all about CHFI version 9.\n\n8\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.138\nAnd that's right, and joining us back in\nthe studio as always, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:26.800\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.820\nAdam, we're glad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.510\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well.\n\n13\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.520\nContinues to go well, I should say.\n\n14\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.060\nWe've been doing several\nepisodes continuing our theme and\n\n15\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.370\nour thought process here.\n\n16\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400\nTalking about network forensics,\n\n17\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.260\nhow we deal with information\npertaining to the data transmission and\n\n18\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.310\nthe use and recipients and senders and\nall that kinda stuff around data.\n\n19\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.730\nHow we deal with that,\nwhere we find that information.\n\n20\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.730\nIf you haven't seen some of our prior\nepisodes, we did talk a little bit about\n\n21\n00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.350\nsome tools that may be used to do this,\ntook a look at event managers,\n\n22\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.330\nhow we parse and interact with logs\nboth on a local machine and talked about\n\n23\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.620\nthe possibility of Syslogging and\nSIEM systems and remote log management.\n\n24\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.080\nWe took a look at a few different versions\nof what that program may look like on\n\n25\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.570\ndifferent platforms, both on\nthe server side and on the client side.\n\n26\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.570\nSo we talked about some of\nthe things we could do there.\n\n27\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.920\nIt may be worth your while to go back and\ntake a look.\n\n28\n00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.764\nWe also I've talked about, specifically\nin this regard, some of the US or\n\n29\n00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:24.320\na specific US federal rule\nof evidence rule 803,\n\n30\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.090\nwhich gives us the understanding of how\nlog data may be entered into evidence.\n\n31\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.660\nWhat is the background for that legally?\n\n32\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.795\nWhere does it come from?\n\n33\n00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:32.710\nWhat's the understanding of that?\n\n34\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.030\nWe've talked about that and\n\n35\n00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.160\nactually quoted the exact verbiage from\nthe statute that would be relevant here.\n\n36\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.900\nSo we went through that as well.\n\n37\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.010\nAlso spent some time talking\nabout the methodology and\n\n38\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.160\nthe thought process associated with logs,\nlog management.\n\n39\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.690\nBut also then correlation and\nthe ideas behind event correlation.\n\n40\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.126\nWhat event correlation is?\n\n41\n00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.460\nThe idea of looking at events across\na timeline or a sequence of events and\n\n42\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.740\nassociating them in some meaningful way.\n\n43\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520\nTook a look at different event\ncorrelation methodologies.\n\n44\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.990\nTalked about different ways we\ncould use event correlation, and\n\n45\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.190\nthe ways they could apply those\nmechanisms, those methodologies.\n\n46\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.747\nAnd different tools, we see these\nin toolsets like IDS's, IPS's,\n\n47\n00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:11.630\nFirewalls, certainly log management,\nevent correlation systems.\n\n48\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.840\nSo we just made reference to a lot of\nthat kind of stuff and talked about that.\n\n49\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.840\nAnd made sure we understood\nthe value of that.\n\n50\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.670\nI also broadly, in our first episode of\nthis topic or this area, made the case\n\n51\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.320\nthat network forensics is much broader\nthan just examining network traffic.\n\n52\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.400\nAnd I want to return to that theme and\n\n53\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.010\nremind you of that as we\ngo into part four here.\n\n54\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.620\nOur last conversation on this topic as\nwe move into other knowledge areas.\n\n55\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.220\nBut keeping in mind that we are stitching\ntogether, in the network forensics area,\n\n56\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.510\na lot of our prior conversations, the\noverarching thought process about incident\n\n57\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.120\nmanagement, the themes, the methodology,\nand the operational requirements of\n\n58\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.250\nthe forensic investigator, the incident\nresponder, to do that properly.\n\n59\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.530\nChain of custody, validation of evidence.\n\n60\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.990\nAll things we've talked about.\n\n61\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.840\nTalked about hard drive forensics,\n\n62\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.730\ntalked about operating system\nforensics up until now.\n\n63\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.370\nThose themes are important here.\n\n64\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.690\nIn up coming conversations we'll be\ntalking about database forensics,\n\n65\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.690\nmobile forensics, email forensics,\n\n66\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.180\nweb forensics, all those things may play a\npart in the network forensics conversation\n\n67\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.270\nbecause traffic moves through these\nmediums, it's stored in these areas and\n\n68\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.260\nis manipulated by and is interacting\nwith applications in these areas.\n\n69\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.580\nAnd we have to understand that, as a stack\nof functionality, network forensics really\n\n70\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.300\nrepresents the distilled essence\nof all these other areas.\n\n71\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.980\nCapturing the traffic as it flows and\nunderstanding how to manipulate and\n\n72\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.130\nmanage that traffic, and\ninterpret it as part of what we do.\n\n73\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.134\nWe also did a thorough review of the\nOSI Model, and Daniel helped with that.\n\n74\n00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.790\nAnd appreciate him for\nhelping us to walk through that.\n\n75\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.210\nSo we've been down a lot of\ndifferent roads up until now, right?\n\n76\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.510\nIf we turn our attention back to\nwhat we're here to talk about,\n\n77\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.005\nwhen we analyze router logs,\nsee how seamless that was?\n\n78\n00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:48.753\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Didn't even have to say anything,\n\n79\n00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:51.642\nall I had to do was just make a slight\nmotion, he is just right there,\n\n80\n00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:52.321\non the button.\n\n81\n00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Like a simpatico thing going on.\n\n82\n00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.785\n&gt;&gt; It is almost like he's paying\nattention and watching what I do.\n\n83\n00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is is incredible, very,\n\n84\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.580\nvery responsive.\n\n85\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.060\nSo analyzing router logs, right?\n\n86\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.190\nWhen we talk about how we do this,\nput together a little list here, and\n\n87\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.240\nI said what you see is really based on\ndirection, and I mean that sincerely.\n\n88\n00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.370\nWe don't get the same information\nnecessarily in routers,\n\n89\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.520\ndepending on what direction\nthe traffic flow is going.\n\n90\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.320\nWe may, depending on the router of course,\n\n91\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.094\nand the things that we turn on and/or use,\nor third-party routing.\n\n92\n00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:20.772\nThird-party routing, that would be cool.\n\n93\n00:04:20.772 --> 00:04:21.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Third-party\n\n94\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.460\nrounding of routing\nactivity that takes place.\n\n95\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Can you route that for me, can-\n&gt;&gt; Hand that to you and relay that for\n\n96\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.010\nme if you would.\n\n97\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.620\nRemember, folks, boys and girls, relay bad\nunless it is a validated relay, right?\n\n98\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.550\nOpen relay gets you in trouble,\ndon't wanna be on that spam blacklist.\n\n99\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.752\nSo making sure we think about\nthe fact that if we do hand off\n\n100\n00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:42.361\ninterpretation of this information and\nanalysis to a third party SIEM solution or\n\n101\n00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:46.567\nsomething like that, we may see more\ndetailed discussion of the data, but\n\n102\n00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:50.906\ntraditionally In incoming logs, we tend\nto see the five things noted there,\n\n103\n00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:54.740\noutgoing logs tend to represent\nthe seven things noted there.\n\n104\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.320\nThat doesn't mean that we can't find\nmore information, incoming or outgoing,\n\n105\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.230\nbased on the kind of\nlogging we may enable and\n\n106\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.430\nthe kind of information\nmanagement we have.\n\n107\n00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.075\nBut just as a baseline, essentially I\nam just saying normally half a router,\n\n108\n00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:10.553\nno special kind of router, normal logging,\nno special kind of logging,\n\n109\n00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:13.373\njust out of the box,\nkind of standard, what would you see.\n\n110\n00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:15.570\nYou would tend to see this kind\nof information more or less.\n\n111\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.000\nSo keeping that in mind and\n\n112\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.810\nmaking sure aware that we are thinking\nabout that is important, because again,\n\n113\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.270\nwhat we get may indicate to us, or not\nindicate to us, there's been an incident.\n\n114\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.060\nWe have to think about whether or\nnot the information provided\n\n115\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.120\nis enough to be able to stand on\nauthoritatively say \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n116\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.880\nSomething has or has not happened.\n\n117\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.330\nFor instance, outgoing log details\nwhere we may get URL information and\n\n118\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.150\nports, right, will be important.\n\n119\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.120\nYou see we do have ports in both places,\nboth incoming and outgoing.\n\n120\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.780\nNot unusual.\n\n121\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.810\nBut we may not see, for incoming we're\nnot gonna see the URL information.\n\n122\n00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.280\nWe'll see IP addresses coming back and\n\n123\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.500\nforth and the ability to\ncorrelate that would be important.\n\n124\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.480\nBecause we wanna know that IP\naddress equals that web server.\n\n125\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.360\nYou know, in theory maybe if\nthat's what we're looking at.\n\n126\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.280\nAnd we have to understand that traffic.\n\n127\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.843\nAnd so, it would be helpful for us to\nsee some additional levels of detail.\n\n128\n00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:06.550\nAnd something for us to think about and\nbe concerned with.\n\n129\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.790\nI have a note there at the bottom.\n\n130\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.170\nYour R cache is important.\n\n131\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.160\nR minus eight to remind us of the fact,\nas we've shown you and\n\n132\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.790\ntalked about many times already,\nthat there are lots and\n\n133\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.350\nlots of pieces to the puzzle of\nputting together the transmission,\n\n134\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.050\nthe reception of data and looking\nat it from multiple vantage points.\n\n135\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.680\nSender, the recipient,\nthe hop count, how many devices or\n\n136\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.590\ngateways we pass through along the way,\nwhat do those gateways or\n\n137\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.520\ndevices tell us about the information,\nits status as it moved through there,\n\n138\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.370\nwas integrity ensured all the way\nthrough the transmission path.\n\n139\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.580\nWas the integrity modified?\n\n140\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.620\nIf so, where?\n\n141\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.790\nCan we zero that in?\n\n142\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.130\nThese are things we have to know about.\n\n143\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.850\nNot that the R cache by itself\nwill tell us all of that.\n\n144\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.660\nQuite the opposite tells us\nnone of that for the most part.\n\n145\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.140\nBut it does tell us the MAC address,\nIP mapping on the client in question.\n\n146\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.820\nWhatever endpoint we're looking at.\n\n147\n00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.840\nAnd it's gives us an indication\nof who's talking to who and\n\n148\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.200\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n149\n00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200\nAnd we could use that against\nthe logs to further correlate for\n\n150\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.310\nthe refiner understanding of information.\n\n151\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.580\nVery important.\n\n152\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.986\nLink that with most likely netstat,\n\n153\n00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:09.030\nalthough Nbtstat would be more preferable,\ncuz it gives us the open ports.\n\n154\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.660\nSo it's gonna help us correlate the port\ninformation we see in the router or\n\n155\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.737\nin the firewall logs.\n\n156\n00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:18.480\nNbtstat and NetBIOS names may not be of\na lot of value to us looking at a gateway\n\n157\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.970\ndevice but\ncertainly inside of the network on the LAN\n\n158\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.210\nthat would be very helpful if we are\ntalking about potentially transmissions\n\n159\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.350\nthat went between two endpoints in\nthe LAN as opposed to over the WAN.\n\n160\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.630\nAnd so nbtstat may be a valuable\nsource for additional information.\n\n161\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.240\nIpconfig/displaydns.\n\n162\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.770\nLook at the name resolver cache.\n\n163\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.820\nThat would be helpful to\ncorrelate against router and\n\n164\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.970\nfirewall logs to do some of the crosswalk\nagainst URLs, and source and\n\n165\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.800\ndestination IP mapping\nthat we'd wanna validate.\n\n166\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.478\nMy point is and we've talked about\nthis before in other episodes.\n\n167\n00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:52.169\nEspecially in the very first set of\nepisodes we did for CHFI, where we really\n\n168\n00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:57.467\nlaid out the methodological foundations of\nwhat it means to be a incident responder.\n\n169\n00:07:57.467 --> 00:08:00.799\nTo understand how to be a certified\nhacking forensic investigator and\n\n170\n00:08:00.799 --> 00:08:02.275\ndeal with digital forensics.\n\n171\n00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:06.401\nYou have to really think, like an incident\nresponder because that is in essentially\n\n172\n00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:08.360\nwhat you are doing at some level.\n\n173\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.720\nAnd in order to carry out those\nactivities, think about that,\n\n174\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.530\nhave that in our minds,\nwe have to understand and\n\n175\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.370\nreally think about the fact that\none datapoint is never enough.\n\n176\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.250\nIt may indicate to us\nthat there's a pattern,\n\n177\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.630\nmay indicate to us there's a path, gives\nus direction, gives us point of access,\n\n178\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.000\ntells us, that we should begin\nour search and start to look.\n\n179\n00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.120\nBut it doesn't provide the definitive\nauthoritative last word on the subject.\n\n180\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.040\nWe have to have multiple points of\nreference for that data to ensure its\n\n181\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.590\nvalidity, to ensure its integrity, to\nensure its liability that we are accepting\n\n182\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.490\nit is minimal and validy,\nvalidity and the value of that data.\n\n183\n00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.610\nI have to stop making up words as we talk,\nright?\n\n184\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Man,\nyour Wikipedia page is growing by days.\n\n185\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.450\n&gt;&gt; You know, we could have like an\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n186\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.717\n&gt;&gt; Just it's entry there for\n\n187\n00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:52.490\nall the different words.\n\n188\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.514\nSo good news is,\nnone of those words are on the exam.\n\n189\n00:08:54.514 --> 00:08:56.270\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n190\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.650\nSo that actually works out well for you.\n\n191\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.242\n&gt;&gt; One less thing.\n\n192\n00:08:58.242 --> 00:08:59.780\n&gt;&gt; One less thing to worry about, exactly.\n\n193\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.890\nSo the validity, and\nthe value of that data,\n\n194\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.350\nby being referenced from multiple entries\nin different tools, different systems,\n\n195\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.030\ndifferent data points, becomes so\ncritical to our success,\n\n196\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.300\nto provide accurate detailed\ninformation as an investigator.\n\n197\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.420\nTo attest to that information,\n\n198\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.060\nto provide a realistic\nassessment of what has happened.\n\n199\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.940\nTell, in other words, a realistic,\ncompelling and accurate,\n\n200\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.860\nvery important, accurate story.\n\n201\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.080\nAnd to do so authoritatively, provide\nthat guidance, that information, that\n\n202\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.340\ninterpretation, either in a court of law\nor behind the scenes in an investigative\n\n203\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.420\nhearing, that may be administrative inside\nthe company or just in a written form.\n\n204\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.860\nFor administrative action, right?\n\n205\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.520\nWhatever the case maybe,\nwe have to put our best foot forward.\n\n206\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.095\nAnd we owe it to not only the victims but\nalso the potential\n\n207\n00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:46.520\nperpetrators to get it right because\nwe don't wanna falsely accuse somebody.\n\n208\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.580\nNever wanna do that and certainly go\nout of our way to ensure we do not.\n\n209\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.530\nBut, we also have to make sure that we are\naccurately representing what did happen,\n\n210\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.390\nso we can eliminate the things\nthat did not happen.\n\n211\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.420\nIt's very, very important for\nus to be able to that.\n\n212\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.080\nAnd the more attention we pay to detail,\nthe more cross walking of data and\n\n213\n00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.980\nthe dependencies we find to\ntell that story and beef up or\n\n214\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.280\nsupport that narrative with facts that\nare represented in multiple systems.\n\n215\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.960\nThe harder it is for somebody to say,\n\n216\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.110\nthat's not possible,\nthere's no way I did that.\n\n217\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.660\nWell we've got evidence of\nthat in ten different systems.\n\n218\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.840\nWhile there's always a possibility,\nDaniel, or Adam,\n\n219\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.050\nor whoever,\nthat maybe all ten systems are lying.\n\n220\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.510\nHelp me walk through the logic of that,\nhow does that happen?\n\n221\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.790\nAnd what is the likelihood\nof that happening?\n\n222\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.360\nVery small,\n\n223\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.270\nwhen you have ten different independent\ndata points that point to the same thing.\n\n224\n00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.360\nCould somebody be framed?\n\n225\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.190\nCould somebody have potentially\nplanted all that evidence?\n\n226\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.112\nAbsolutely, I'm not saying that couldn't\nhappen, but this is not the movies.\n\n227\n00:10:37.112 --> 00:10:37.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n228\n00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:40.290\nwe're not talking about a Hollywood\nsuspense thriller here.\n\n229\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.680\nWe're not talking typically, in other\nwords, about activities that would warrant\n\n230\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.920\nthat kind of time and attention from the\npeople with resources that could do that.\n\n231\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.840\nAnd I promise you, if the people with\nresources that could that, did that.\n\n232\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.200\nYou probably would not find\nevidence of the fact they did.\n\n233\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.746\nRight?\nSo as\n\n234\n00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:53.519\na result of the-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n235\n00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.156\n&gt;&gt; You made the wrong person mad.\n\n236\n00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:56.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n237\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.000\nYou don't want to piss off the people\nwith helicopters and guns.\n\n238\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.480\nIt's never.\nNever going to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n239\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.308\n&gt;&gt; Stay on their good side.\n\n240\n00:11:01.308 --> 00:11:03.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so pay your taxes.\n\n241\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:03.950\nPay on time.\n\n242\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.630\nMake sure you do those things.\n\n243\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.020\nAs a result, just being honest with you,\nas a result,\n\n244\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.260\nwhen we find ten different systems,\neight systems, two systems, five systems,\n\n245\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.470\nfind more than one telling that story that\nessentially winds up in the same place.\n\n246\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.860\nSay narrative, our conference level\ngoes up as an investigator, and\n\n247\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.220\nour doubts are diminished.\n\n248\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.700\nThey never diminish fully, and never\na hundred percent confident, in anything\n\n249\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.760\nthat I tell a customer, every time without\nfail cuz there's always some sliver,\n\n250\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.390\nsome shadow of doubt, some unknown\nquantity that can get into the system.\n\n251\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.280\nWe talked about residual risk,\nwe talk about data remnants,\n\n252\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.770\nwe talk about remainders\nall over the place, right?\n\n253\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.830\nRemainders are something you've\ngot to pay attention to, right?\n\n254\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.100\nRemainders, so if we talk about al of\nthat, we know in the back of our minds, so\n\n255\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.810\nthat theirs always going to be\nthis little sliver of doubt.\n\n256\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.900\nEven as the best documented\nevidence provides, we can say that\n\n257\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.500\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, which is what\nwe often say, we feel this is the case.\n\n258\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.800\nWe don't say definitively no matter what,\nthis happened,\n\n259\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.190\ntheir is no other explanation.\n\n260\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.660\nAt least I would never say that,\nbecause the reality is,\n\n261\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.080\ntheir may be another explanation\nthat will come to light later.\n\n262\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.170\nBut for now, given the evidence,\n\n263\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.740\nthis is the best possible\nset of facts we can go with.\n\n264\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.760\nThat's what we're looking for.\n\n265\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.640\nAnd when we look at this kind of data,\nwe'll be thinking, where else can I find\n\n266\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.570\ncross referenceable data that's\ngoing to hep me understand that.\n\n267\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.820\nSo remember, looking at things like\nthe Arp cache, as we set NexStat,\n\n268\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.480\nNbStat, IPconfig, whatever it may be,\n\n269\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.420\ntheirs just all sorts of additional places\nwe find this data being warehoused,\n\n270\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.920\nbeing stored locally on remote\nsystems in between the two.\n\n271\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.260\nWe have to go pull as much\nof that evidence together,\n\n272\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.920\ncorrelate as much of that as we can.\n\n273\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.550\nBecomes very, very important for us to be\nthinking that way and to be doing that.\n\n274\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.780\nWith that in mind, what we do have,\nI am just going to roll up here so\n\n275\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.730\nyou can see Cisco router logs.\n\n276\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.490\nIt's kinda tucked in the corner there,\nbut just some notes.\n\n277\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.320\nI wanted to just throw a quick couple\nof documents up for you on Cisco.\n\n278\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.370\nReally wouldn't be a conversation\nabout network forensics if we were not\n\n279\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.090\ntalking about Cisco and Cisco\ninfrastructure is so pervasive today.\n\n280\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.861\n&gt;&gt; Who are they again?\n\n281\n00:12:58.861 --> 00:12:59.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little small company.\n\n282\n00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:00.958\nYou've never heard of them, right?\n\n283\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.396\nThey're kinda like-\n&gt;&gt; 85% of the market share.\n\n284\n00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:02.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're kinda like\n\n285\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.590\nthe Apple of their space, right?\n\n286\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Nobody knows who they are.\n\n287\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNever heard of it.\n\n288\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.480\n&gt;&gt; But clearly the world,\nif not the world leader, certainly,\n\n289\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.650\nright up there right at the very top\nof the scale with regards to network\n\n290\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.450\ntraffic management in the modern world,\nreally if you think about the logic of\n\n291\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.080\nwhat the world would be like\nwithout a company like Cisco.\n\n292\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.410\nIn their space, yeah we'd be talking about\na very different kind of networking and\n\n293\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.350\nthought process today.\n\n294\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.640\nBut I thought it would be good to put\nup a severity level classification for\n\n295\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.092\nsyslogging for Cisco iOS routers.\n\n296\n00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:37.030\nThese are the levels, of course\nthe system equivalents the numbers that\n\n297\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.140\nare represented and\nthe description of what they represent.\n\n298\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.250\nBe valuable for\nyou to have a sense of this again.\n\n299\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.420\nMany of you may work with Cisco\non a regular basis, you may not.\n\n300\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.330\nThere are other routing vendors\nin the world, believe it or not.\n\n301\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.670\nJuniper, among others,\nI'll mention Juniper here in a minute, but\n\n302\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.590\nthe reality is Cisco is\ncertainly pervasive.\n\n303\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.520\nAnd it would be a good idea\nif you have a sense of this.\n\n304\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.210\nSo, you could see if we see emergency\nlevel, system level zero, right system\n\n305\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.490\nunusable messages, you crash messages,\nthings have gone horribly wrong that kind\n\n306\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.490\nof thing, alert level one, immediate\naction required, critical level two.\n\n307\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.166\nIt's funny that alert, is immediate action\nrequired, where as critical is below.\n\n308\n00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.260\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the sense the higher up we go\n\n309\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.390\nfrom most important to least, and\nwe feel that a critical is not an our\n\n310\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.800\nlexicon outside of this kind of world, we\nwould say critical is probably the worst\n\n311\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.610\nthing you have, but actually alert is\nconsidered immediate action required.\n\n312\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.602\nSo, it's just kind of interesting how\nvendors will label and manage their world-\n\n313\n00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:34.687\n&gt;&gt; It really confuses me,\n\n314\n00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:36.381\nwhen I think of critical condition.\n\n315\n00:14:36.381 --> 00:14:37.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In a hospital,\n\n316\n00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:38.652\nthat's an immediate reaction.\n\n317\n00:14:38.652 --> 00:14:39.532\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We need to actually\n\n318\n00:14:39.532 --> 00:14:40.950\nwork on somebody at that point.\n\n319\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.845\nBut here,\nthey have their own nomenclature.\n\n320\n00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just, you know, that's why you\ngotta know the vendor, you gotta know\n\n321\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.940\nthe information, how they classify it, so,\nlittle bit of a different world, right.\n\n322\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.600\nSo, you see critical error warning\nnotification information debugging.\n\n323\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.890\nSo we have all of that.\n\n324\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.940\nIn addition, one other one here,\nCisco firewalls.\n\n325\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.380\nThey use what are called pneumonics.\n\n326\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.540\nThese are numerical equivalents in this\ncase for representing severity for\n\n327\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.080\nlogging purposes.\n\n328\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.780\nSo that way, when we go through and\nwe take a look, and this is a,\n\n329\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.550\nas you can see, rather long chart, right.\n\n330\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.750\nTwo pages, approximate page and a half.\n\n331\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.470\nI gave you the most common ones here and\nwhat they are.\n\n332\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.760\nSo, you could see that there are,\n\n333\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.980\nit's a little explanation of\nwhat they happen to be here and\n\n334\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.340\nyou could see the severity codes according\nto whatever the pneumonic would be.\n\n335\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.450\nAgain, if you work with Cisco, this would\nbe something that would be fairly common\n\n336\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.340\non the firewall side, specifically.\n\n337\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.510\nNot on the router side,\nthis is going to be on the firewall now.\n\n338\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.910\nBut if you work with the infrastructure\nand you're familiar with it,\n\n339\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.020\nyou would have seen those.\n\n340\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.520\nIf you don't, it would be good for\nyou to take a look at them.\n\n341\n00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.440\nAgain, I would not memorize\nthe entire two-page chart, but\n\n342\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.200\nI would be passingly\nfamiliar with the concept.\n\n343\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.466\nCan't say definitely\npick one over another,\n\n344\n00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:54.032\nbecause you're likely to see one and\nnot the other.\n\n345\n00:15:54.032 --> 00:15:57.079\nBut I can tell you that it would be\na good idea for you to have at least,\n\n346\n00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:00.668\na passing familiarity with the concepts\nwith regards to these particular items\n\n347\n00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.850\nthat I'm actually calling out, so\nthat if you're asked about them.\n\n348\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.916\nYou at least can speak\nknowledgeably about them.\n\n349\n00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:09.571\nOf the two, if I was gonna spend\nsome time focused and studying,\n\n350\n00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:13.850\nI would probably want to be a little\nbit more familiar with this right here.\n\n351\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.960\nThis is log Cisco router table, then I\nwould be about the mnemonics table for\n\n352\n00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.745\nthe firewalls but that's just me.\n\n353\n00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could just be totally off base\n\n354\n00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:23.230\nabout that.\n\n355\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.040\n&gt;&gt; And big disclaimer, I very well\ncould be, but you never know, right?\n\n356\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.090\nSo would be helpful for you to just\ntake that to heart, as they say.\n\n357\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.820\nSo just some words about Cisco,\ndon't want to leave them out.\n\n358\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.345\nI did mention I would put Juniper up,\nas well.\n\n359\n00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:40.935\nJuniper is another major provider of\ninfrastructure on the routing side.\n\n360\n00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:44.495\nCertainly perhaps not as well\nknown in certain circles as Cisco,\n\n361\n00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:48.255\nbut very well known in others,\ncertainly a big competitor of Cisco's.\n\n362\n00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:52.025\nThey have their own operating system,\njust like Cisco does, Cisco iOS.\n\n363\n00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:58.720\nJuniper is routing iOS, Juniper's\nrouting OS is the JunOS or JUNOS.\n\n364\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.190\nIt's good that you can just\nkind of randomly name your\n\n365\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.150\nstuff whatever you would like.\n\n366\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n367\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.400\n&gt;&gt; But it does provide for both system\nlogging and tracing, as you can see.\n\n368\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.600\nPretty straightforward, most vendors,\nmost systems will do this today.\n\n369\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.407\nLogs are saved.\n\n370\n00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.803\nAs you can see there var/log/ is location,\nand\n\n371\n00:17:14.803 --> 00:17:17.200\nwe do have a little bit\nof information there.\n\n372\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.790\nDepending on the series of\nthe hardware that is used,\n\n373\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.730\nthere are different designations for\nJuniper gear.\n\n374\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.220\nM, MX, T, etc., J.\n\n375\n00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.000\nThere's different locations based on\nwhat kind of device you're using, so\n\n376\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.400\nI just noted that for you.\n\n377\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.702\nThe command used to actually show\nthe logs, as you can see here,\n\n378\n00:17:34.702 --> 00:17:36.855\nuser@my-device &gt; show log messages.\n\n379\n00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:40.140\nSo show log messages will provide that for\nyou, just so you know.\n\n380\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.180\nWent through the Cisco\nfirewall log data with you.\n\n381\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.310\nI showed you the little document that I\nlisted here, just to show you what it is.\n\n382\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.090\nBut you can see the kind of data\nthat would typically show up\n\n383\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.200\nin a firewall log from Cisco.\n\n384\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.470\nGot a bunch of items listed.\n\n385\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.970\nThere, again, pretty common.\n\n386\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.330\nTake the word Cisco out of that,\njust say firewall log and\n\n387\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.050\nremove the mnemonic message.\n\n388\n00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.660\nItem number two, date and\ntime, firewall action,\n\n389\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.600\nsource, destination IP,\naddress and port and\n\n390\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.990\ntype of request, and you'd be looking\nat any firewall anywhere in the world.\n\n391\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.370\nThe only item that's really\nspecific to Cisco is number 2,\n\n392\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.640\nand only because that's what they\ncall their informational messages.\n\n393\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.360\nOther vendors may have\na different name for that, but\n\n394\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.260\nessentially they'll provide very similar\ndocumentation in their logs as well.\n\n395\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.510\nSo you could see the concept\nof what may be involved there.\n\n396\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.270\nCheckpoint as well,\nanother big firewall vendor.\n\n397\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.200\nDon't wanna leave them out.\n\n398\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.510\nJuniper has IDS,\nas you see them listed below as well.\n\n399\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.630\nLots of different companies,\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n400\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.480\nJust trying to spread the wealth, so to\nspeak, spread the knowledge a little bit\n\n401\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.130\nabout different vendors,\nhow their perspective may show up.\n\n402\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.840\nAs an investigator, remember, it's great\nif all you do is work on one platform, and\n\n403\n00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.530\nthat's all you see and all you know.\n\n404\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.360\nAnd if you're fortunate enough to do that,\nthat's great.\n\n405\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.280\nBut the reality is as a generalist,\n\n406\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.290\nyou're gonna be asked to respond to a\nbunch of different incidents on different\n\n407\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.300\nsystems from different vendors\nwith different vantage points.\n\n408\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.150\nAnd while we don't expect you\nto be an expert on all of them,\n\n409\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.030\nwe expect you to have a sense of\nthe kind of data you'll find and\n\n410\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.680\nbe able to at least\noperate securely enough\n\n411\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.280\nthat you're not gonna screw anything\nup until the experts arrive.\n\n412\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.170\nIf you're dealing with Checkpoint and\nyou've never dealt with Checkpoint before,\n\n413\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.440\nprobably wanna call in the Checkpoint\nexpert in, secure the system,\n\n414\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.950\nensure its viability\nuntil somebody arrives.\n\n415\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.980\nAnd then, let the experts gather the data.\n\n416\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.450\nBecause you may not understand\nhow to do so successfully.\n\n417\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.950\nAnd you may not understand how to\ninterpret the data that you're seeing.\n\n418\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.570\nCheckpoint, for instance, has both\nsoftware and hardware-based solutions.\n\n419\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.370\nThey have virtual appliances\nyou can use as well.\n\n420\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.570\nSo depending on the kind of\nimplementation, you may have to approach\n\n421\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.820\ndata gathering from a very different\nperspective in terms of, what do I do?\n\n422\n00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.180\nDo I secure the physical or\nappliance-based OS that the device is\n\n423\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.170\nrunning on, capture a drive image\nincluding the firewall settings?\n\n424\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.760\nOr if it's a hardware appliance,\nhow do I deal with that?\n\n425\n00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.780\nBecause it's got it's own OS.\n\n426\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.420\nIt's gonna operate differently, right?\n\n427\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.100\nSo we have to think about these variables.\n\n428\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.450\nAnd this is the case for\nmany of the systems we talk about.\n\n429\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.190\nCisco's gear is traditionally\nhardware based.\n\n430\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.690\nYou're gonna be dealing with a rackable,\nmountable, or\n\n431\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.950\nrather rackable infrastructure that is\ngonna be accessed through a console.\n\n432\n00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.650\nThough, these days, more of these things\nhave web consoles than interfaces, right?\n\n433\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.270\nSo you just want to think about that.\n\n434\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.540\nDo we have virtual routers?\n\n435\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.430\nWell, virtualization platforms do\nhave the capability to virtualize\n\n436\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.660\nthe network stack.\n\n437\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.025\nCisco may not necessarily be making them,\nbut we do have virtual switches.\n\n438\n00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:27.522\nCisco has virtual switches in market\non the VMWare platform, for instance.\n\n439\n00:20:27.522 --> 00:20:29.885\nThe Nexus series of switches\nhave been virtualized,\n\n440\n00:20:29.885 --> 00:20:31.635\nturned into virtual appliances.\n\n441\n00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:36.275\nSo it's not unlikely that we would see\nsome of this gear being virtualized, and\n\n442\n00:20:36.275 --> 00:20:39.367\ntherefore we would have to deal with that\nin perhaps a slightly different way.\n\n443\n00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:43.207\nThere's a lot of variables, is my point to\ntoday, when it comes to not just forensics\n\n444\n00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:46.017\nin the network space but\nmore broadly forensics overall.\n\n445\n00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:51.280\nThe ongoing morphing of our platforms\ninto Cloud and Internet of Things,\n\n446\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.650\nintegrated converged systems, is not\nonly complicating our efforts, but also\n\n447\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.600\nopening up additional possibilities for\nus with regards to information gathering.\n\n448\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.690\nWe have to be open to that idea as\ninvestigators, but we also have to have\n\n449\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.825\na healthy respect and fear for the fact\nthat that does expose us to additional\n\n450\n00:21:07.825 --> 00:21:11.310\nconcerns about information integrity,\navailability, and confidentiality.\n\n451\n00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.830\nAnd we have to balance those\ntwo things as we continue on\n\n452\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.360\nbecause it is a brave new world out there,\nas we say.\n\n453\n00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.410\nAnd no, for instance, conversation\nwould be complete without the Cloud,\n\n454\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.540\ndiscussions of the Cloud, and how we\ndeal with Cloud in virtualization today.\n\n455\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.170\nWe'll see that and talk about that.\n\n456\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.280\nCertainly I've already mentioned it.\n\n457\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.660\nWe'll continue to mention it in\nother shows and other episodes.\n\n458\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.880\nBut it is an ongoing trend and one that,\n\n459\n00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.570\nregardless of what other people say,\nis not going away, right?\n\n460\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.180\n&gt;&gt; I mean, if anything,\n\n461\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.470\nit's only going to intensify and\nget more involved as we continue forward.\n\n462\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.100\nLess and less our infrastructure's\ngoing to be owned by us.\n\n463\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.650\nMore and more of it is going to be out\noutsourced and managed by third parties.\n\n464\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.900\nAnd that complicates\nforensics tremendously.\n\n465\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.120\nCuz we may not be able to put our hands\ndirectly on the gear, and may not be able\n\n466\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.440\nto rely on information that is gathered\ndirectly because we may not be doing it.\n\n467\n00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.080\nAnd we don't know necessarily who the\npeople that are doing the gathering are.\n\n468\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.630\nAnd we don't know what their forensics\ncapabilities and their skill sets are.\n\n469\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.292\nHave they been trained?\n\n470\n00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:02.450\nDo they operate in\na forensically sound manner?\n\n471\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.554\nHow was the information gathered?\n\n472\n00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:04.640\nBy who?\n\n473\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.870\nUnder what conditions?\n\n474\n00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.540\nTo what end?\n\n475\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.631\nThis is all being done blindly by\nthird parties essentially operating at\n\n476\n00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:14.789\nthe request of a law enforcement agency\nmore often than not with regards to\n\n477\n00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:15.475\nthe Cloud.\n\n478\n00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:19.188\nCuz vendors are only gonna move if they\nhave a warrant or a legal document shoved\n\n479\n00:22:19.188 --> 00:22:22.129\nunder their nose telling them\nthey have to provide this data.\n\n480\n00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:25.740\nAnd when they do that, they're going\nto do it and certainly comply.\n\n481\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.720\nI'm not suggesting that\nthey're not gonna comply.\n\n482\n00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.520\nI'm not suggesting they're not gonna\nuse skilled professionals to do this.\n\n483\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.554\nWhat I'm suggesting is verification and\n\n484\n00:22:32.554 --> 00:22:35.403\nvalidation of those facts\nbecomes a lot more difficult for\n\n485\n00:22:35.403 --> 00:22:39.239\nus to present that evidence in a way\nthat allows us cross-jurisdictionally to\n\n486\n00:22:39.239 --> 00:22:42.635\nbe able to then present that evidence\ncompellingly in a court of law.\n\n487\n00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:47.050\nBecause remember, where that data is\ngathered is where the data is stored.\n\n488\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.139\nThat Cloud repository may be in a\ndifferent jurisdiction than where the case\n\n489\n00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:51.260\nis gonna be heard.\n\n490\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.030\nAnd as a result,\nmay be subject to different laws and\n\n491\n00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.760\ndifferent interpretations of whether or\nnot that data is valid.\n\n492\n00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.540\nAnd the methodologies used and\nthe approached used\n\n493\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.040\nhas to be validated in both jurisdictions\nso that data would be considered unusable.\n\n494\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.410\nAnd that's very important for us to\nconsider because if one jurisdiction casts\n\n495\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.460\ndoubt on that data and its veracity and\nintegrity, it is an even steeper hill for\n\n496\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.630\nus to climb on the other jurisdiction to\nvalidate that the data should be allowed.\n\n497\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.480\nIn other words, one court will\ngive preference to another court's\n\n498\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.270\ninterpretation of the fact\nthat the data may not be valid\n\n499\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.750\nbefore they look at the data on\nits own merits and say yes or no.\n\n500\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.552\nBecause if one court says no, that was\ngathered illegally, the other court's\n\n501\n00:23:26.552 --> 00:23:29.630\nprobably gonna say yes, you know what,\nyou're jurisdiction, your rules.\n\n502\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.410\nYou tell us it was gathered illegally,\nwe gotta go with that because we're not\n\n503\n00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.185\nthe ones who are responsible for\nsaying that.\n\n504\n00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:35.500\nAnd we're gonna believe you and\n\n505\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.940\ngive you preference, which means we can't\nactually interpret and touch that data.\n\n506\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.850\nAnd that becomes a very,\nvery big limiting factor for us.\n\n507\n00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.350\nCloud and virtualization, and I keep\nlinking these two concepts together,\n\n508\n00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.770\nI understand you can do Cloud\nwithout virtualization, and\n\n509\n00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.220\nyou can virtualize without the cloud.\n\n510\n00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.804\nI do get that, I do fully understand that,\nI know you do as well.\n\n511\n00:23:53.804 --> 00:23:56.539\nBut I keep also reminding\nyou of the fact that today,\n\n512\n00:23:56.539 --> 00:24:00.145\nin today's world, the scale and\ncomplexity of our modern systems,\n\n513\n00:24:00.145 --> 00:24:04.561\nespecially in the Enterprise space, That\ngo into these areas could not exist unless\n\n514\n00:24:04.561 --> 00:24:07.014\nthis joining of\ntechnologies was happening.\n\n515\n00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:10.817\nYou couldn't have the scalability and the\nlarge scale cloud farms that we enjoy and\n\n516\n00:24:10.817 --> 00:24:13.809\nuse today without virtualization\nunderlying that technology,\n\n517\n00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:15.071\nit wouldn't be possible.\n\n518\n00:24:15.071 --> 00:24:18.379\nAnd so when we think about the confluence\nof these technologies, and\n\n519\n00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:21.931\nhow they converge, if we're not\nthinking about this as investigators.\n\n520\n00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:25.368\nWe're not taking this on, especially\nin this area with regards to network\n\n521\n00:24:25.368 --> 00:24:29.083\nforensics, we're doing ourselves a great\ninjustice, doing our customers and\n\n522\n00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:31.115\nthe people we represent a great injustice.\n\n523\n00:24:31.115 --> 00:24:35.165\nAnd we're not fully understanding\nthe impact of the events that are causing\n\n524\n00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:38.591\nus to be investigating in the first\nplace or at the first moment.\n\n525\n00:24:38.591 --> 00:24:40.792\nAnd we don't truly understand\nthe nature of what we are seeing,\n\n526\n00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:42.275\nif we are not thinking about these things.\n\n527\n00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:44.876\nAll this data,\nalmost without exception at some point,\n\n528\n00:24:44.876 --> 00:24:47.424\nprobably passed through\nsystems that were not directly\n\n529\n00:24:47.424 --> 00:24:51.181\nin the control of our customer, along the\nway back and forth to what we were doing.\n\n530\n00:24:51.181 --> 00:24:53.293\nA lot of that would have\nbeen in the cloud and\n\n531\n00:24:53.293 --> 00:24:57.290\na lot of it would have been exposed to\nalternate solution, alternate systems and\n\n532\n00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.550\nperhaps alternate capabilities\nto monitor or manage that data.\n\n533\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.620\nWe have to at least get knowledge and\ninvestigate that possibility at the best\n\n534\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.665\nof our abilities in order\nto truly tell that story.\n\n535\n00:25:05.665 --> 00:25:08.125\nSo I just wanna make sure you're aware\nof that and thinking about that.\n\n536\n00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:11.029\nWe've talked about Checkpoint,\nwe've talked about Juniver,\n\n537\n00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:13.676\njust had some additional\ninformation about those things.\n\n538\n00:25:13.676 --> 00:25:16.127\nWhat about Honeypots and Honeynets?\n\n539\n00:25:16.127 --> 00:25:20.204\nTalked about the fact that honey spots\nare wireless access point honey pots so\n\n540\n00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:22.272\nwe set up to do some investigation, and\n\n541\n00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:26.741\npotentially to draw that access in into\na crucible and examine what they're doing.\n\n542\n00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:29.377\nHoneypots and Honeynets,\nwe've talked about before, as well.\n\n543\n00:25:29.377 --> 00:25:32.653\nThe idea of a single machine being\ndangled out there is a honeypot,\n\n544\n00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:34.125\na group of them is a honeynet.\n\n545\n00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:36.992\nI just want to make sure we understand and\nthink about the logic of that.\n\n546\n00:25:36.992 --> 00:25:38.639\nWe mentioned Wireshark before,\n\n547\n00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:42.336\nI thought it would be a good idea just\nto show you a Wiki page on Wireshark, in\n\n548\n00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:46.301\ncase you haven't seen it actually demoed\nWireshark for you in a prior episode.\n\n549\n00:25:46.301 --> 00:25:47.693\nIt's just actually my fault,\n\n550\n00:25:47.693 --> 00:25:50.643\nI forgot to bring up the page from\nwhen we were there looking at it.\n\n551\n00:25:50.643 --> 00:25:53.273\nBut they do have a great Wiki,\nif you're going to be using Wireshark,\n\n552\n00:25:53.273 --> 00:25:55.295\nprobably be a good idea for\nyou to go on and take a look.\n\n553\n00:25:55.295 --> 00:25:58.341\nKeep up to date with the most\nrecent revisions, the builds,\n\n554\n00:25:58.341 --> 00:26:00.740\nthe general how-tos,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n555\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.493\nHow do you customize,\nhow do you work with the tool, etc.\n\n556\n00:26:03.493 --> 00:26:08.283\nThe old or legacy Wireshark versus the new\none that has more of a web interface kind\n\n557\n00:26:08.283 --> 00:26:09.425\nof a look and feel.\n\n558\n00:26:09.425 --> 00:26:11.992\nA little bit different you want\nto probably invest a little time\n\n559\n00:26:11.992 --> 00:26:12.920\nto take a look at that.\n\n560\n00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.579\nSo just going out and\ntaking a look wiki.wireshark.org,\n\n561\n00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:18.991\nalways good to take a look at that and\nmake sure you know whats going on there.\n\n562\n00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:22.193\nI just have a couple of quick\nnotes here on DHCP logging and\n\n563\n00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:24.146\nWindows ODBC logging in general.\n\n564\n00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:27.013\nWe talked about a lot of different\nlog types and what happens with them.\n\n565\n00:26:27.013 --> 00:26:31.228\nDHCP logs are saved in\nthe system 32DHCP directory.\n\n566\n00:26:31.228 --> 00:26:37.335\nGet things like ID, Date/Time description,\nIP Address, Host Name, MAC Address, etc.\n\n567\n00:26:37.335 --> 00:26:39.866\nSo we do just wanna make\nsure we are aware of that.\n\n568\n00:26:39.866 --> 00:26:42.418\nYour ODBC Logging in general for\ndatabases, and\n\n569\n00:26:42.418 --> 00:26:46.590\nthe manipulation of data as we connect,\nor create the plumbing or pipes for it,\n\n570\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.604\nwhatever you wanna think about that.\n\n571\n00:26:48.604 --> 00:26:52.832\nIt's also importing record of all\nthe data properties that are going and\n\n572\n00:26:52.832 --> 00:26:56.518\nattaching to the data being used\nwith it is always good to have.\n\n573\n00:26:56.518 --> 00:26:58.352\nAnd again, you could see the kinda\nthings that we get there.\n\n574\n00:26:58.352 --> 00:27:02.496\nAmount of bytes set and received, status\ncodes, so we have web related information,\n\n575\n00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:06.443\nactions carried out, targets, these are\nthings that will be part of these logs.\n\n576\n00:27:06.443 --> 00:27:10.145\nAgain, it's good for us to have a sense of\nthat, and know that, because there may be\n\n577\n00:27:10.145 --> 00:27:12.980\ninformation there that would be\nvaluable for us to take note of.\n\n578\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.491\nOr at least be able to speak\nauthoritatively about, and\n\n579\n00:27:15.491 --> 00:27:16.940\nmake sure we are familiar with.\n\n580\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.271\nAnd probably the last thing that we just\nwanna have a little bit of a conversation\n\n581\n00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.327\nabout as we wrap up here.\n\n582\n00:27:21.327 --> 00:27:24.846\nFundamentals of reconstruction for\ninvestigation of a crime.\n\n583\n00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:29.513\nWhat are the kinds of analysis that we\nengage in is what I'm talking about here.\n\n584\n00:27:29.513 --> 00:27:32.752\nThree kinds specifically,\ntemporal, relational, and function.\n\n585\n00:27:32.752 --> 00:27:36.540\nTemporal, as I've suggested,\nis the idea of event correlation,\n\n586\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.067\ntime based correlation temporal events or\ntime based events.\n\n587\n00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:44.798\nSo sequential event trails, how do we deal\nwith telling that story compellingly,\n\n588\n00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:46.428\nbeginning, middle, end.\n\n589\n00:27:46.428 --> 00:27:49.512\nIf you think about the God and so\nabout how you write a good story and\n\n590\n00:27:49.512 --> 00:27:50.756\nhow you tell a good story.\n\n591\n00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:54.453\nWrite well structured intro,\nyour meat and potatoes in the middle,\n\n592\n00:27:54.453 --> 00:27:55.864\nwrite dessert on the end.\n\n593\n00:27:55.864 --> 00:27:58.430\nYou got to think about all that,\nput that all together.\n\n594\n00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.928\nIf temporal analysis shows,\nthat events occurred out of sequence,\n\n595\n00:28:01.928 --> 00:28:04.173\nthen something is not right there, right?\n\n596\n00:28:04.173 --> 00:28:08.202\nI mean just, it's hard to hack into\na system unless you somehow first gain\n\n597\n00:28:08.202 --> 00:28:12.106\naccess through an open door or you bust\nin a door and kick it in and get in.\n\n598\n00:28:12.106 --> 00:28:14.664\nAnd if those events did\nnot occur authoritatively,\n\n599\n00:28:14.664 --> 00:28:17.920\nwe cannot attribute them to something and\nsomehow miraculously,\n\n600\n00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.008\nmysteriously we subtly take over the\nsystem, we're missing something, right?\n\n601\n00:28:22.008 --> 00:28:24.382\nThere is something there\nwe're just not able to see,\n\n602\n00:28:24.382 --> 00:28:26.618\nthere's a part of the story\nthat we're missing.\n\n603\n00:28:26.618 --> 00:28:28.523\nIt's there,\nwe just haven't dug deeply enough,\n\n604\n00:28:28.523 --> 00:28:30.310\nand we just don't have\nenough understanding.\n\n605\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:34.382\nSo Temporal Analysis is really\nimportant cuz it lays out the facts\n\n606\n00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:38.391\nin a compelling storyline,\nlinear, progressive kind of way.\n\n607\n00:28:38.391 --> 00:28:41.542\nAnd when we could tell that story\npoint to point, moment to moment,\n\n608\n00:28:41.542 --> 00:28:45.322\nwe're also validating and checking that\nwere not missing key details, right?\n\n609\n00:28:45.322 --> 00:28:48.186\nThat would obviously shed light\nto complete the picture for us,\n\n610\n00:28:48.186 --> 00:28:49.838\nvery important aspect to what we do.\n\n611\n00:28:49.838 --> 00:28:54.784\nRelational analysis,\nthis is all about correlation of actions.\n\n612\n00:28:54.784 --> 00:28:56.119\nSo, cause and effect, right?\n\n613\n00:28:56.119 --> 00:28:57.594\nBetween suspect and victim.\n\n614\n00:28:57.594 --> 00:29:01.900\nSuspected this, victim had this happen,\nthis was the result.\n\n615\n00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.943\nTemporal and\nRelational analysis do go hand in hand.\n\n616\n00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.272\nCuz, once we lay out\nthe temporal timeline,\n\n617\n00:29:07.272 --> 00:29:11.074\nwe could begin to attribute relational\nevents or events that occurred and\n\n618\n00:29:11.074 --> 00:29:13.793\ntheir cause and\neffect to those timelines, right?\n\n619\n00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:17.699\nWe could say at t minus or\nt plus five minutes this occurred, and\n\n620\n00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:19.703\nthen this is the direct result.\n\n621\n00:29:19.703 --> 00:29:23.256\nAnd so temporal and relational analysis\noften walk down the road hand in hand.\n\n622\n00:29:23.256 --> 00:29:24.510\nIt's very important to know that.\n\n623\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.504\nAnd then Functional analysis description\nof possible conditions of a crime.\n\n624\n00:29:28.504 --> 00:29:32.504\nTestifies to whether or not the event is\nresponsible for a crime, what they were\n\n625\n00:29:32.504 --> 00:29:36.702\nand of course what their functionalities\nand relationship might be to each other.\n\n626\n00:29:36.702 --> 00:29:41.336\nIn other words you are again reinforcing\ntemporal and relational with functional,\n\n627\n00:29:41.336 --> 00:29:45.200\nbreaks it down and says okay,\nthis is what caused this event to occur.\n\n628\n00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.276\nWe have this condition, this patch\nwas missed, this port was left open,\n\n629\n00:29:49.276 --> 00:29:52.761\nthis account was not monitored,\nthis password was not reset or\n\n630\n00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:54.635\nwas too simplistic or whatever.\n\n631\n00:29:54.635 --> 00:29:57.649\nAnd as a result of these things\nI can relate these events, and\n\n632\n00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:59.552\nthey occurred during this timeline.\n\n633\n00:29:59.552 --> 00:30:01.931\nBy doing all three of these things,\n\n634\n00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.976\nwe're able to tell the story\nfrom multiple vantage points,\n\n635\n00:30:05.976 --> 00:30:10.997\nall together contributing to the complete\npicture, if you will, right?\n\n636\n00:30:10.997 --> 00:30:13.738\nThe understanding that we\nneed to create in order to\n\n637\n00:30:13.738 --> 00:30:16.050\nspeak authoritatively to what occurred.\n\n638\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.964\nSo, Temporal, Relational, and\nFunctional analysis, right?\n\n639\n00:30:18.964 --> 00:30:19.730\nVery important,\n\n640\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.751\nwe wanna make sure we understand how\nall three of these come together.\n\n641\n00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:26.321\nI wanna make sure we understand\nthe connection, as I pointed out,\n\n642\n00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:30.274\nbetween these three methods of analysis\nin order to finish up on how we're\n\n643\n00:30:30.274 --> 00:30:33.306\nreally wrap up how we in this\narea act as investigators.\n\n644\n00:30:33.306 --> 00:30:36.653\nRemember investigators first and\nforemost have to be great sleuths,\n\n645\n00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:39.612\ngreat detectives, but\nhave to be good storytellers as well.\n\n646\n00:30:39.612 --> 00:30:42.157\nIf we're not good at both,\nwe're only doing half our job.\n\n647\n00:30:42.157 --> 00:30:42.934\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n648\n00:30:42.934 --> 00:30:46.142\nAdam we do thank you for\nlike you just said, wrapping this up,\n\n649\n00:30:46.142 --> 00:30:50.155\nbringing this to the culmination of our\nnetwork forensics portion of the CHFI\n\n650\n00:30:50.155 --> 00:30:52.090\nseries that we're working on here.\n\n651\n00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.013\nBut that being said it looks like we've\ncome to the end of the networking portion.\n\n652\n00:30:56.013 --> 00:30:57.593\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n653\n00:30:57.593 --> 00:31:01.677\nBut apparently we are ready for\nsigning off, for ITProTV.\n\n654\n00:31:01.677 --> 00:31:03.001\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n655\n00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:05.322\n&gt;&gt; Say it isn't so,\nwe have other stuff to talk about.\n\n656\n00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:05.938\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n657\n00:31:05.938 --> 00:31:06.622\n&gt;&gt; In this episode.\n\n658\n00:31:06.622 --> 00:31:07.575\n&gt;&gt; In this episode.\n\n659\n00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:08.817\n&gt;&gt; Amazing, how does that happen?\n\n660\n00:31:08.817 --> 00:31:10.615\n&gt;&gt; The time ticks by.\n\n661\n00:31:10.615 --> 00:31:12.578\n&gt;&gt; That is what happens,\nit's exactly what happens.\n\n662\n00:31:12.578 --> 00:31:14.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, everybody, we're done for\n\n663\n00:31:14.738 --> 00:31:16.280\nnow, we'll see you soon for\nanother episode.\n\n664\n00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.602\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n665\n00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:24.558\n[MUSIC]\n\n666\n00:31:24.558 -->

00:00:08.366\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.468\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:14.076\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.588\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:22.326\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode where we are continuing on with\n\n8\n00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:24.502\nmore on our CHFI version nine series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:28.069\nAnd joining us yet again in the studio to\ncontinue that topic, our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.690\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.990\nAdam, glad to have you again today,\nand how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.193\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well,\nit is a web-tastic day.\n\n13\n00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:35.073\n&gt;&gt; Web-tastic.\n\n14\n00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:37.775\n&gt;&gt; Also hopefully a dry day, we'll see\nhow that goes, but it's a web-tastic day.\n\n15\n00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:38.991\n&gt;&gt; So, spider webs?\n\n16\n00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:40.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, kind of, well,\n\n17\n00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:42.459\nthat is coming out in what,\nabout three, four weeks,\n\n18\n00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.795\nthe new Spiderman movie is coming out.\n\n19\n00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:44.664\n&gt;&gt; That's true, it is.\n\n20\n00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:49.181\n&gt;&gt; They've actually started\nthe whole [INAUDIBLE].\n\n21\n00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.284\n&gt;&gt; I'm a very big Spiderman fan so\nI look forward to them-\n\n22\n00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.010\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n23\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.757\n&gt;&gt; No matter how good or\ncrappy they maybe.\n\n24\n00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.397\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think there'll be someday be a good\n\n25\n00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:56.070\none actually.\n\n26\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n27\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490\nI think its got potential.\n\n28\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.250\n&gt;&gt; It does and\nthey've got Dj Khaled doing the promos.\n\n29\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; With Spiderman for Subway.\n\n30\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.745\n&gt;&gt; I'm sold [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just,\n\n31\n00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:07.970\nI think that's gonna be awesomely\ncool just because of that alone.\n\n32\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.142\n&gt;&gt; All right, so no not quite like\nspider webs, but the web nonetheless.\n\n34\n00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:13.777\nOne of the areas that we have to,\n\n35\n00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:17.970\nwe could not really say we've done a good\njob talking about, digital forensics.\n\n36\n00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.590\nThe information required for\nbecoming a CHFI.\n\n37\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.832\nIf you are indeed you are planning\non pursuing the EC-Council exam, and\n\n38\n00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:26.150\nhopefully you will.\n\n39\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.322\nObviously very important for\nyou to be able to validate your knowledge,\n\n40\n00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.614\nvalidate your skills,\nhave the ability to do that.\n\n41\n00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:34.698\nBut we also have to talk about how you\napply this knowledge in real world and\n\n42\n00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.060\nwe try to balance those things.\n\n43\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.024\nAnd when we talk about both those things,\nwe'd be remiss if we did not also speak\n\n44\n00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:43.914\nabout integrating and\nfiguring out how the web\n\n45\n00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:48.900\nfits into the picture of investigation\nfrom a digital forensics perspective.\n\n46\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.696\nThe web forensics and the information we\nneed to know about it is what we wanna\n\n47\n00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.740\nspend some time focusing on here.\n\n48\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.732\nWhen we think about the web,\nthe world wide web,\n\n49\n00:01:56.732 --> 00:01:57.800\nspider webs-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.440\n&gt;&gt; To your point, any kind of web!\n\n51\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.250\nEspecially the world wide web,\n\n52\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.210\nperhaps the internet depending on\nhow you choose to refer to it.\n\n53\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.746\nYou can actually tell what generation\nsomebody's from by whether they refer to\n\n54\n00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:11.351\nit as the web or the internet, or now the\ninternet of things or the Cloud because-\n\n55\n00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:11.871\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n56\n00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:18.335\n&gt;&gt; More modern, younger, hipper cooler IT\ninvestigators, forensics professionals,\n\n57\n00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:24.380\nand IT folk of a certain generation will\nrefer to this as the Internet, or the Web.\n\n58\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.470\nBut, you know, I see more and\nmore as I talk to customers and\n\n59\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.060\nespecially as I deal with\nstudents coming in to classes.\n\n60\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.684\nIf they are younger, they will refer\nto it more as something like the IOT,\n\n61\n00:02:34.684 --> 00:02:37.910\nthe internet of things, or\nthey'll just call the web the cloud.\n\n62\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.360\nThey'll be like,\nwell that's the cloud, right?\n\n63\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.840\nI mean,\nisn't that what we're talking about?\n\n64\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.909\nIt's a public Cloud or it's a private\nCloud, but isn't that the Cloud?\n\n65\n00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.385\nSo, you and I are just old.\n\n66\n00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:46.025\n&gt;&gt; We are dinosaurs.\n\n67\n00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:47.992\n&gt;&gt; It's essentially, I guess,\nwhat I'm trying to point out.\n\n68\n00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:48.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n69\n00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:52.156\nwhen we think about forensics,\nthink about forensics on the web.\n\n70\n00:02:52.156 --> 00:02:56.462\nThere are some challenges that we have\nassociated associated with the web.\n\n71\n00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:58.072\nWhat would you say some of\nthe challenges are, right?\n\n72\n00:02:58.072 --> 00:02:59.812\nIf you think about just generically.\n\n73\n00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:04.282\n&gt;&gt; Hey what challenges associated with\ndealing with information management,\n\n74\n00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:07.122\nsecurity, forensics,\nin an environment like the web?\n\n75\n00:03:07.122 --> 00:03:08.932\nWhat are some things you\nmay throw up on a list?\n\n76\n00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:11.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well from a penetration\ntesting standpoint,\n\n77\n00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:14.092\nI see that it is an access point.\n\n78\n00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:16.058\nIt is always open, and\nsupposed to be available.\n\n79\n00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.101\n&gt;&gt; It being the web?\n\n80\n00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:17.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it being the web.\n\n81\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.480\n&gt;&gt; Generically, the web, right?\n\n82\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.869\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThere is,\n\n83\n00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.150\nit's just a connection to everyone.\n\n84\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.030\nAnd it's always there.\n\n85\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.335\nI can just get on and start looking for\nways to do things and connect.\n\n86\n00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.207\nSo ubiquitous, or\nalways available to anybody, in theory,\n\n87\n00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:35.317\nwhether they may or\nmay not be authorized,.\n\n88\n00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:39.298\nMay or may not be a person who should\nbe seeing that information, or\n\n89\n00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:41.012\nsome information, right.\n\n90\n00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.405\nIt may not be that, but whatever it is,\nbut, so it's always available.\n\n91\n00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:46.502\nOkay that's certainly one\nchallenge potentially.\n\n92\n00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:47.462\nIt could be a benefit though as well,\nright.\n\n93\n00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:51.752\nIn the sense that it potentially does\noffer us the opportunity to connect and\n\n94\n00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.842\ninteract with information\nboth as investigators.\n\n95\n00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:56.866\nAs IT professionals,\nsecurity professionals,\n\n96\n00:03:56.866 --> 00:04:00.007\nbut also potentially just as information\nworkers, average users, right?\n\n97\n00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:00.508\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:03.133\n&gt;&gt; So, there may be a good and\na bad to a lot of things.\n\n99\n00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:07.824\nThis Yin Yang that we sometimes\nrefer to is part of this functional\n\n100\n00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:09.201\nthought process.\n\n101\n00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:12.703\nEverything that we think of\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n102\n00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:17.273\nEverything we think of from a subset,\nin terms of forensics is part of\n\n103\n00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:21.043\nthe overarching,\nbroader thought processes of security.\n\n104\n00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:23.463\nWe have to consider, and\nwe've had this conversation right,\n\n105\n00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.083\nin several episodes prior.\n\n106\n00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:29.663\nWhere I've tried to point out, and get you\nto think about the mindset of the attacker\n\n107\n00:04:29.663 --> 00:04:32.820\nfrom the perspective now,\nof applying that to the defender.\n\n108\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.200\nEspecially in the anti-forensics\nconversations we had, right,\n\n109\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.550\nwhere we really focused exclusively\non what would the hacker do, right?\n\n110\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.695\nSo what would THD,\nwhat would the hacker do.\n\n111\n00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:44.992\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; WWTHD right, what would the hacker do?\n\n112\n00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:49.506\nBecause that's really kind of our catch\nphrase in the anti-forensics conversation\n\n113\n00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.720\nbecause that's what we're doing.\n\n114\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.380\nWe're looking from\nthe investigative perspective,\n\n115\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.970\nthe defensive perspective, right?\n\n116\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.776\nWhat would somebody coming and looking to\nattack us across the web let's say, right,\n\n117\n00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:02.197\nalways on, always available.\n\n118\n00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:03.000\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.540\n&gt;&gt; What would they be doing, how would\nthey do it, when would they do it?\n\n120\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.520\nWhere would they come from?\n\n121\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.270\nWhat kind of capabilities,\nwhat kind of tools, right?\n\n122\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.920\nWhat are the logistics involved?\n\n123\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.640\nThese are things we'd wanna have\nknowledge of as an investigator.\n\n124\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.961\nWe spent some time developing\nthat thought process there.\n\n125\n00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:23.167\nAnd I really tried to draw you out on the\nidea that in order to be better at what\n\n126\n00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:28.558\nwe do, we have to really think like\nthe people that are gonna come against us.\n\n127\n00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:32.330\nAnd try to do those things,\nbecause we understand that mindset.\n\n128\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.090\nWe may not be able to stop every\nattack,and we spoke specifically about\n\n129\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.751\nthe fact that that's really not our goal.\n\n130\n00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:40.619\nDespite what we tell you all\nthe time about information security,\n\n131\n00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.310\ndespite what you hear.\n\n132\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.150\nThat you should just be\nstanding on that border.\n\n133\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.823\nRemember A Few Good Men?\n\n134\n00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:46.808\nLike, great movie.\n\n135\n00:05:46.808 --> 00:05:48.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nGreat movie.\n\n136\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.380\n&gt;&gt; Like Jack Nicholson,\nDemi Moore, Tom Cruise certainly.\n\n137\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.060\nGot a whole bunch of really powerful\nactors and actresses In that movie.\n\n138\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Kevin Bacon was in that movie.\n\n139\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Kevin Bacon plays the prosecutor for\nthe government.\n\n140\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.630\nCertainly love Kevin Bacon.\n\n141\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.150\nAnd so when you think about that and\n\n142\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.710\nspecifically I'm thinking about that\nscene, right, in A Few Good Men.\n\n143\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.850\nWhere the first time that we meet\nthe Jack Nicholson character, right,\n\n144\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.350\nso Tom Cruise goes down to Gitmo right?\n\n145\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.336\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Essentially has his-\n\n146\n00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:16.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:17.874\n&gt;&gt; Introduction right,\n\n148\n00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:21.450\nto Jack Nicholson as\nthe commanding officer.\n\n149\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.620\nAnd they're sitting out there and\nhaving breakfast, right?\n\n150\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.360\nOn the, essentially the veranda out\nbehind I guess where he lives on base.\n\n151\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.612\nAnd they have the dialog, and he goes in\non this idea of basically I'm paid to have\n\n152\n00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:38.885\nbreakfast across from people that are\ntrained to kill me and you can't scare me.\n\n153\n00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:41.432\nI'll tell you what you want,\nI'll support you, but\n\n154\n00:06:41.432 --> 00:06:43.309\nbasically he's going into this idea.\n\n155\n00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.009\nThat basically I have a job and\nI do my job and\n\n156\n00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.369\nmy job is not to get scared by bad\npeople and worry about those things.\n\n157\n00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.342\nThen you see, fast forward to\nthe end of the movie they're,\n\n158\n00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:57.210\nconfronting each other In the courtroom,\nand they have that showdown right?\n\n159\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.083\nWhere Cruise pushes him over the edge and\n\n160\n00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:01.241\ngets him to admit that\nhe ordered the code red.\n\n161\n00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:04.020\nAgain, spoiler alert,\nthe whole premise of the movie.\n\n162\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.612\nBut the idea that when they're\nhaving this dialogue, and\n\n163\n00:07:07.612 --> 00:07:11.423\nNicholas says listen,\neither pick up a gun and stand a post and\n\n164\n00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:15.030\nbe part of the solution, or\ndon't tell me how to do my job.\n\n165\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.254\nBecause I'm doing what I think is the\nappropriate thing to defend my country,\n\n166\n00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:21.590\nand this whole big speech he goes into.\n\n167\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.130\nBut he makes the point that unless you're\ngonna be a part of the solution, you don't\n\n168\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.500\nhave a right to tell me how to do my job\nbecause you're a part of the problem.\n\n169\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.001\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n170\n00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:31.547\nI'm not suggesting that\nit's that black and white.\n\n171\n00:07:31.547 --> 00:07:36.429\nBut what I am suggesting is that unless we\nunderstand the mindset of the bad actor,\n\n172\n00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:40.820\nthe threat person, the source right,\nwhere the threat comes from.\n\n173\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.160\nIt's very difficult for us to do our\njob as a defender and a reactive or\n\n174\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.180\nproactive defender as we've\noften talked about here.\n\n175\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.120\nAnd we have to get into that mindset,\nright?\n\n176\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.560\nWe've got to be in\nthe mind of the attacker.\n\n177\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.238\nAnd web forensics is no different.\n\n178\n00:07:54.238 --> 00:07:57.993\nWe've got to understand that\nmethodologies, mechanisms, tools,\n\n179\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:01.873\ntechniques that we will put to use here\nMay be used as Daniel suggested for\n\n180\n00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:02.652\ngood or evil.\n\n181\n00:08:02.652 --> 00:08:06.472\nI mean the same techniques we're\ngonna show you or have shown you for\n\n182\n00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:10.895\nthings like going after and acquiring\ndata from a hard drive, could be used for\n\n183\n00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:15.385\ngood to show what went wrong, or it could\nbe used for ill, somebody is a bad actor\n\n184\n00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:18.970\ncan attempt to gather data from for\ninstance hypothetically.\n\n185\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.100\nWe haven't really talked about this, we'll\ntalk about it a little bit in the web area\n\n186\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.540\nin the upcoming conversations\nin cloud forensics.\n\n187\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.130\nBut what if a bad actor were to somehow\nbreak in from outside the organization?\n\n188\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.040\nGet access, either through, let's say,\nmaybe an injection attack, or\n\n189\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.680\na buffer overflow.\n\n190\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.716\nOr a privilege escalation, or\nany one or all combinations of these.\n\n191\n00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:41.460\nAnd we'll go through all these and\ntalk about what they are.\n\n192\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.730\nBut let's say hypothetically for a minute.\n\n193\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.320\nWhen you try to break into a machine,\n\n194\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.490\nyou do a lot of this kinda\nwork behind the scenes, right?\n\n195\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.506\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Daniel's actually the mass marauder.\n\n196\n00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:50.769\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't know that but\n\n197\n00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:53.400\nthat's actually his handle out\nthere in the hacker world.\n\n198\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.540\nSo when you're doing this, trying to\nhack in let's say to one of your VMs,\n\n199\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.380\nor trying to get ready to do something,\npracticing up on your pen testing skills.\n\n200\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.691\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; One of the key things you're looking to\n\n201\n00:09:02.691 --> 00:09:06.163\ndo is not just necessarily overtake and\nown that one machine but\n\n202\n00:09:06.163 --> 00:09:09.655\nassuming it's a broader network\nthat you're connecting to.\n\n203\n00:09:09.655 --> 00:09:13.874\nYou may certainly target a single machine\nbut a lot of times you're targeting that\n\n204\n00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:17.359\nmachine with the idea of using it as\na launching pad to do some recon,\n\n205\n00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:19.450\nto figure out what else is there.\n\n206\n00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.580\nAnd then, if you build that picture,\none or two more layers out, move into\n\n207\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.010\nseveral different areas and continue\nto establish a beach head broader and\n\n208\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.940\nwider, wider than ever, it's what we do.\n\n209\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.340\nAnd so, the idea that we may be able to,\nas a hacker,\n\n210\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.780\nas a bad actor, move through one or\nmore systems broadly and\n\n211\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.905\nwidely looking for information\nsuch as virtual machine templates,\n\n212\n00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:48.460\nand/or virtual machines that are stored,\nperhaps not running currently,\n\n213\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.070\nin some sort of storage\nnetwork where they would be.\n\n214\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.340\nPerhaps this blinking light display right\nbehind me here that is used for storage.\n\n215\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.090\nWho knows?\n\n216\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:03.063\nAnd imagine for a minute that, that bad\nactor goes in and gets one or more files.\n\n217\n00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:04.816\nOne or more VHDX files.\n\n218\n00:10:04.816 --> 00:10:08.710\nOne or more files,\nwhatever format those hard drives are in.\n\n219\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.582\nWhatever vendors platform\nwe're virtualizing on,\n\n220\n00:10:11.582 --> 00:10:16.363\ngrabs those, takes them, removes them from\nthe system, exfiltrates them in some way,\n\n221\n00:10:16.363 --> 00:10:20.252\nand then loads them up offline like\nwe showed you with various tools, and\n\n222\n00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.977\njust spins them up in a virtual\nenvironment, and has access to them.\n\n223\n00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:26.500\nBut wait, we don't have the password so\nyou can't get in, well,\n\n224\n00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.730\nwe know we can break through that.\n\n225\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.090\nThat's not a big deal.\n\n226\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.260\nAnd we know we can load the VHD or VHDX\nas essentially just a hard drive image.\n\n227\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.320\nWe've shown you several\ntools that'll do that.\n\n228\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.040\nWe could use the NTFS explorer,\nwe could use the access FDK tool set.\n\n229\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.800\nThere's all sorts of different ones\nwe could use that would mount and\n\n230\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.970\nread that image file.\n\n231\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.460\nWe have tools specific to virtualized\nenvironments, by the way, that will be\n\n232\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.950\ndesigned specifically to work with those\nimage files or those hard drive files.\n\n233\n00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.120\nWe could mount them as data\nfiles as opposed to running VMs.\n\n234\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.010\nWe could pull all sorts of\ninformation out of them.\n\n235\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.204\nAnd we'll talk more about\nthis in upcoming episodes,\n\n236\n00:11:01.204 --> 00:11:04.454\nespecially in the database forensics area\nwill be an upcoming set of shows we do.\n\n237\n00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:07.510\nWe'll show you how to break in,\nand grab data from a database.\n\n238\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.530\nWhat the hacker could do and\nforensically how they examine for that.\n\n239\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.080\nTake a look at that in the cloud, talk\nabout that from the malware prospective.\n\n240\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.050\nGot a lot of interesting\nstuff still to come.\n\n241\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.530\nBut the ideas that we have to really start\nthinking as we imagine the web, really\n\n242\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.620\nI like the way you framed it as this\ngateway that allows us to access content.\n\n243\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.000\nAlways on, always available and\nthe pro in that is that, yes,\n\n244\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.580\nit's always on, it's always available.\n\n245\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.113\nThe con is that, yes, it's always on,\nit's always available.\n\n246\n00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:35.270\nFor every good thing, we have a bad thing.\n\n247\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.215\nAnd so, we gotta understand,\nas investigators,\n\n248\n00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:42.872\nas we begin this part of our conversation,\nthis part of our journey, our biggest\n\n249\n00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:47.340\nchallenge with the web in terms of\nforensics, is the fact that it's the web.\n\n250\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.241\nThat it literally is always on,\nit is always there and as a result, if we\n\n251\n00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:55.794\nare not paying attention to it, and we\ndon't understand what is happening there,\n\n252\n00:11:55.794 --> 00:11:58.380\nmethods of access as Daniel pointed out.\n\n253\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.652\nHow we get in?\n\n254\n00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.360\nHow could the bad actor get in?\n\n255\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.660\nWhere would they come from?\n\n256\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.380\nWhat would they have access to?\n\n257\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.870\nUnder what conditions?\n\n258\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.035\nHow often do you use SQL Injection?\n\n259\n00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:13.930\nAnd/or once you inject in either overflow,\nor somehow get to a prompt of some kind,\n\n260\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.470\nor some credential required mechanism,\n\n261\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.440\nwhere you could then enter\na credential and then gain an access.\n\n262\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.580\nHow often do you do then, use some\nsort of privilege escalation attack,\n\n263\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.020\ntypically to get in to the box, and gain\naccess, something that's pretty often.\n\n264\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIf the SQL Injection didn't give it to\n\n265\n00:12:29.132 --> 00:12:32.332\nme immediately, then that's\nthe next exact thing I'm going for.\n\n266\n00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:34.341\n&gt;&gt; Or if you got it as part\nof the actual injection,\n\n267\n00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:38.210\nyou wouldn't even need it depending on\nthe kinda attack and the buffer overflow.\n\n268\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.220\nThat you either are able to entertain or\nultimately wind up with,\n\n269\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.916\nyou may wind up with some sort\nof elevated prompt directly.\n\n270\n00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:46.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not always but it does happen, if not,\n\n271\n00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.200\nyou're gonna go after accounts.\n\n272\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.097\n&gt;&gt; That's a good day.\n\n273\n00:12:49.097 --> 00:12:50.899\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a shorter work day,\n\n274\n00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:52.481\nit cuts down several steps for us.\n\n275\n00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.770\nBut that's the end game, that's the goal.\n\n276\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.180\nAnd if we know that going in, if we know\nthat those web applications are gonna\n\n277\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.220\nbe the front end portals that hackers\nare gonna keep chipping away at, and\n\n278\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.350\neventually if we're not smart and\nwe're not secure,\n\n279\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.700\nthey're gonna gain access through,\nwe've got our work cut out for us.\n\n280\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.308\nBecause this is where we are gonna have\nto spend a tremendous amount of time,\n\n281\n00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:16.836\nopportunity, and resources to defend.\n\n282\n00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:18.700\nI've told you, we can't stop everything.\n\n283\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.360\nWe just got to make it incredibly\ndifficult for things to happen so\n\n284\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.610\nwe can see evidence of it and\ntry to figure out it's happening and\n\n285\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.820\nif we are not good at that,\nprevent it from happening again.\n\n286\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.430\nAnd this is where we're\ngonna have to stand guard.\n\n287\n00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.450\nThis is where, as Nicholson said in\nthe movie, we gotta pick up the gun and\n\n288\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.440\nstand the post.\n\n289\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.860\nBecause as investigators, as IT\nprofessionals, if we're not vigilant,\n\n290\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.890\nespecially in this area today,\nI don't think of too many customers,\n\n291\n00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.740\ntoo many people, too many businesses that\nI know of that don't have some sort of\n\n292\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.610\npresence in the web or the cloud or\nsome combination of those things.\n\n293\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.210\nEven if it's just limited to, hey,\nwe have a portal for you to log in and\n\n294\n00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.940\nwork remotely to see your email.\n\n295\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.900\nWell, that alone may or\nmay not lead to other things.\n\n296\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.720\nI'm very hard-pressed to think of any of\nmy customers that don't have exposure\n\n297\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.590\non the Web or through the cloud either\npublic or private, today, in some form.\n\n298\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.831\nAnd remember, a lot of attacks\ncome from inside the organization.\n\n299\n00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:11.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n300\n00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:13.821\n&gt;&gt; You're running a private\ncloud on param internally,\n\n301\n00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:17.350\nyou're doing nothing different than\nwe've done for the last 45 years.\n\n302\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.920\nHosting your own infrastructure.\n\n303\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.020\nYou're just probably web enabling some\nof that infrastructure internally,\n\n304\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.920\nand that's fine.\n\n305\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.930\nHave you put safe guards in place\nto prevent people from hacking\n\n306\n00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.970\ninto those web enabled interfaces\nis what we would ask you.\n\n307\n00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.150\nAnd if you have, how strong are they and\nwhen was the last time you checked and\n\n308\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.370\nhow did you validate them?\n\n309\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.820\nAnd if you haven't done that,\nhow do you know, I mean you don't know,\n\n310\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.140\nlet's be honest,\nyou have no clue what's happening there.\n\n311\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.854\nAnd as an investigator it'll be our job\nto show up and tell you what happened,\n\n312\n00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:46.768\nbut it's gonna be hard for\nus to unwind that if you don't have\n\n313\n00:14:46.768 --> 00:14:49.305\na sense of what should be\ngoing on in the first place.\n\n314\n00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:52.383\nWe've talked about this idea of\ndocumentation, of validating and\n\n315\n00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:53.210\nverifying.\n\n316\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.550\nOf all the smart things we gotta do.\n\n317\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.160\nSo challenges with web apps being\ngenerally distributive in nature.\n\n318\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.230\nAlways on, always available.\n\n319\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.410\nVery important.\n\n320\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.540\nActivities and records around these\nactivities are distributed across\n\n321\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.960\nmultiple pieces of infrastructure, in\nperhaps one or more locations on the web.\n\n322\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.900\nThere's different platforms being used.\n\n323\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.080\nIt's a very highly\ndecentralized environment.\n\n324\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.570\nAnd as a result,\nit's a very difficult one for\n\n325\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.265\nus to do work in as a security\nprofessional looking to gather answers.\n\n326\n00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:26.470\nCuz we've got to go to multiple places and\nfind multiple things.\n\n327\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.340\nAnd they may not all be easily accessible.\n\n328\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.170\nWe'll talk about this more in\nthe cloud forensics conversation.\n\n329\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.020\nIn some cases, they may not be\naccessible and available to us at all.\n\n330\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.730\nBecause we don't have the infrastructure.\n\n331\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.060\nAnd people that do are not\ninterested in giving us access.\n\n332\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.160\nTry to go to a cloud vendor and say, hey,\nI'm showing up to do an on site audit for\n\n333\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.010\nmy little cloud tenant\npiece of your puzzle here.\n\n334\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.829\nCan I have access to my hardware?\n\n335\n00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:53.464\nYou're not even get on the phone and have\nthat conversation with them, not unless\n\n336\n00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:57.360\nyour spending several large numbers\nof zeroes at the end of a check and\n\n337\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.578\nyou have private dedicated hosting and\n\n338\n00:15:59.578 --> 00:16:04.245\neven then you don't have a right to honor\nunless you negotiate that ahead of time.\n\n339\n00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:08.576\nYou have a right to request\nthe findings and the assertions and\n\n340\n00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:13.990\nthe attestations from the vendor that\nthey have done audits and they will give\n\n341\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:19.818\nthem to you to certify they are compliant\nwith whatever standards are out there.\n\n342\n00:16:19.818 --> 00:16:21.950\nISO, 27001,\n27002 generically for the ISMS,\n\n343\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:27.470\nthe Information Security Management System\nand controls that overlay on top of that.\n\n344\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:32.500\nFor cloud ISO 27017 and 18,\nfor the overlay around cloud.\n\n345\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.180\nSOC reports and attestation letters around\naudits, and things of that nature, right?\n\n346\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.790\nYou're gonna be able to request those\nfrom large scale cloud vendors, but\n\n347\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.460\nyou're not gonna be able to walk in and\ndo your own audit.\n\n348\n00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.970\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n349\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.750\nNot unless you own your own infrastructure\nand you're hosting your own private cloud.\n\n350\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.970\nAnd so as a result, you may not have\naccess to a lot of this infrastructure,\n\n351\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.020\neven if you want to.\n\n352\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.470\nUnless you walk in with a court order and\nlegal documentation that compels\n\n353\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.610\nthe vendor to give you access,\nthey have no reason to.\n\n354\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.740\nAnd they have stated in their contracts,\nand their SLAs, and\n\n355\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.450\ntheir hosting agreements most likely,\nspecifically the opposite.\n\n356\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.790\nYou're not gonna get access,\n\n357\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.300\nbecause the physical security concerns\nin multi-tenant environments.\n\n358\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.310\nAnd so there's a lot of things we've gotta\nbe thinking about with regards to the web.\n\n359\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:19.280\nIt's not the days of old, when there was\none customer on one set of hardware,\n\n360\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.090\njust like what we have sitting back here.\n\n361\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.360\nAnd you could walk in to that server\nroom and physically you'll interject\n\n362\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.650\nwith the equipment, interact, do what you\nneed to do, cuz there's a lock on door and\n\n363\n00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.740\nyou have the capability to open that door,\ncuz you own the real state.\n\n364\n00:17:33.740

Right, and this kind of falls\ninto the whole anti-forensics thing.\n\n525\n00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:02.429\nI'm trying to obfuscate\nwhere I'm coming from, so\n\n526\n00:25:02.429 --> 00:25:06.050\neven if you do see a log of a connection,\nit's not directly me.\n\n527\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.443\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n528\n00:25:07.443 --> 00:25:11.021\nYou're gonna hit that hop from\nthe anonymizer or the exit point.\n\n529\n00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:14.510\nAnd then you're gonna have to follow\nit down to wherever it came, and\n\n530\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.422\nwherever that came, and\njump into another anonymizer.\n\n531\n00:25:17.422 --> 00:25:20.565\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And you're probably hiding, and\n\n532\n00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:22.335\nyou may have also jumped into one or\n\n533\n00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:25.587\nmore systems that you don't\nactually have direct control of.\n\n534\n00:25:25.587 --> 00:25:30.023\nIn other words, just innocent bystanders\nthat you've take over and are using,\n\n535\n00:25:30.023 --> 00:25:32.436\nin order to then jump\nthrough these hoops and\n\n536\n00:25:32.436 --> 00:25:36.825\nfurther obfuscate you, not only your\nidentity, but your origination point.\n\n537\n00:25:36.825 --> 00:25:39.006\nSo as a result, you may just, passively,\n\n538\n00:25:39.006 --> 00:25:42.342\nwithout their knowledge,\nbe jumping through their machine, or\n\n539\n00:25:42.342 --> 00:25:45.632\nmaybe using their machine as\nthe frontend to do the connection.\n\n540\n00:25:45.632 --> 00:25:47.617\nAnd who's gonna show up and talk to them?\n\n541\n00:25:47.617 --> 00:25:49.853\nWell, the law enforcement officials,\nwhat are they gonna say?\n\n542\n00:25:49.853 --> 00:25:52.725\nI don't have a clue what you're talking\nabout, well, how does that happen?\n\n543\n00:25:52.725 --> 00:25:56.646\nWell, because somebody has routed\na remote access trojan, or taken over or\n\n544\n00:25:56.646 --> 00:25:59.110\nrouted or,\nwe talk about it in different ways.\n\n545\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.713\nBut essentially installed malware\ninto one or more systems,\n\n546\n00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:06.592\nto create a tunnel that they can\nmove through, unobstructed, and\n\n547\n00:26:06.592 --> 00:26:09.520\ntherefore not viewed by\nthe security apparatus.\n\n548\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.300\nWe make it look as if somebody\nelse is doing the work for us,\n\n549\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.650\nwhich indeed they are.\n\n550\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:17.580\nAnd so a lot of times, they'll have these\npublic systems that are taken over.\n\n551\n00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.400\nAnd these systems become\nthe launching point in the frontend.\n\n552\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.797\nAnd when we go to take a look, we find out\nthat there really is somebody behind there\n\n553\n00:26:24.797 --> 00:26:27.117\npulling the strings, the puppet master.\n\n554\n00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:30.283\nBut we can't really get to them, it's very\nhard to figure out where they are and\n\n555\n00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:31.190\nwhat they're doing.\n\n556\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.710\nSo we have to be thinking about these\nas the web forensics challenges\n\n557\n00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.252\naround this area, for this infrastructure\nthat we're gonna be looking at.\n\n558\n00:26:40.252 --> 00:26:43.360\nWe're gonna come back with\nanother discussion here,\n\n559\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.060\nin just a couple of minutes.\n\n560\n00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.320\nYou're gonna just literally click on\na link and see us come right back.\n\n561\n00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.970\nBut we're going to talk about, in a lot of\ndepth here, how we take those areas and\n\n562\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.340\nextrapolate out web vulnerabilities.\n\n563\n00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.037\nNow there's OWASP Top 10 list,\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n564\n00:26:58.037 --> 00:27:01.246\nWe'll broaden that out, and have\nadditional things on there that are not\n\n565\n00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:03.742\nlisted, but\nare still Still very important to discuss.\n\n566\n00:27:03.742 --> 00:27:06.682\nWe'll go through pretty detailed\nconversation about a lot of different\n\n567\n00:27:06.682 --> 00:27:08.400\nareas we have to be concerned with.\n\n568\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.805\nAnd as a result, the investigative\nopportunities that exist when we do\n\n569\n00:27:11.805 --> 00:27:14.770\nsomething like a SQL injection,\nor buffer overflow attack.\n\n570\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.341\nCuz we're looking for\ntelltale signs of activity, and\n\n571\n00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.790\nwe're gonna target\ndatabases as an attacker.\n\n572\n00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.398\nSo as an investigator, we know we\ngotta go look for that stuff, and\n\n573\n00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:24.370\nwe'll tie that to some\nother areas in knowledge.\n\n574\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.861\nSo, we're gonna come back and\ntalk about all that, but\n\n575\n00:27:26.861 --> 00:27:28.453\nthat's gonna be I think a part two.\n\n576\n00:27:28.453 --> 00:27:31.649\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, part two,\neven though we have a little time left,\n\n577\n00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:34.383\nthis is a natural stopping spot for\nour conversation.\n\n578\n00:27:34.383 --> 00:27:37.296\nBecause now you have a little\nbit to chew on and digest.\n\n579\n00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:43.024\nAnd as we continue on you'll be able to\nbetter understand the conversation and\n\n580\n00:27:43.024 --> 00:27:47.520\nwhy things are dangerous or\nbeneficial for us as CHFIs.\n\n581\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.240\nAdam, thanks for getting us this far,\nwe look forward to continuing this talk.\n\n582\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.869\nWe hope you good folks\nout there would join us.\n\n583\n00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:56.130\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n584\n00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.110\nThanks for watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n585\n00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.614\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n586\n00:27:59.614 --> 00:28:00.477\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.573\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.573 --> 00:00:18.125\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:23.259\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing with CHFL Version nine.\n\n9\n00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.623\nAnd joining us in the studio yet again,\nI'm losing what the heck I'm even doing\n\n10\n00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:29.990\n[LAUGH] is our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.112\nAdam, glad to have again man,\nhow is it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.112 --> 00:00:33.728\n&gt;&gt; Thank you sir, always glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.590\nGoing well, hopefully going well for\nall of you out there also.\n\n14\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.350\nWe are continuing our conversations\naround investigating web attacks.\n\n15\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.169\nWeb forensics, we spoke in our last\nepisode about some of the things,\n\n16\n00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.226\nsome of the challenges\nassociated with web forensics.\n\n17\n00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:50.605\nI remind you to think about those as\nwe continue with our conversation here.\n\n18\n00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:54.614\nI wanna focus in on some of the practical\nexperiential related items that\n\n19\n00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:56.528\nare important for web forensics.\n\n20\n00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.347\nMeaning where do this vulnerabilities\nwe're gonna ultimately have\n\n21\n00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:00.910\nto investigate come from.\n\n22\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.640\nWhat is driving them, maybe a little\nbit of understanding about them and\n\n23\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.980\nput them in the broader context\nof what we're talking about.\n\n24\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.526\nOne of the best ways to do that is to\nstart of by referencing something I\n\n25\n00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:12.216\nmentioned in the last episode,\nwhich is the OWASP,\n\n26\n00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:14.373\nOpen Web Application Security Project.\n\n27\n00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.280\nTop ten web application\nvulnerability list.\n\n28\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.390\nIf you're not familiar with OWASP,\nwell you should be as they say, right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.786\n&gt;&gt; Yes they do.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you are doing security in\n\n30\n00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:27.529\nany form factor, and or fashion these days\nand you are doing things that relate to\n\n31\n00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:32.091\ncloud, relate to web, relate to any of\nthe areas that we're talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.369\nYou should have knowledge of OWASP,\nit is one of those organizations that\n\n33\n00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.923\nprovides a great deal and very important\ncontent guidance and information for\n\n34\n00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:43.206\nus in the information security world.\n\n35\n00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:47.280\nIt is an open source project, so\nit is maintained by dedicated community of\n\n36\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.880\npeople that are passionate\nabout what they do.\n\n37\n00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.690\nSome of you listening to us may be\npart of one or more of those projects.\n\n38\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.305\nAnd if you are, thank you for your\ncontinued efforts on behalf of all of us.\n\n39\n00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:01.394\nAnd I wanna take you out there,\nI wanna show you what you can do,\n\n40\n00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:04.020\nshow you where you could\nfind this information.\n\n41\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.606\nThen I wanna walk you through not just\nthe top ten that are currently there, but\n\n42\n00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:10.593\nsome additional items that have\nbeen added to round out our list,\n\n43\n00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:12.408\nbecause there are many, many things.\n\n44\n00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:16.134\nThe nice thing about OWASP, let me just\nscroll down while we're talking here, so\n\n45\n00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:18.950\nyou could see these areas,\nright over here.\n\n46\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.542\nThe nice thing about this\nparticular area for OWASP, but\n\n47\n00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:24.355\nthere are many, many projects,\nand areas, you can look at.\n\n48\n00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:28.460\nThere's a whole bunch of\nstuff going on over here.\n\n49\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.939\nBut, the top ten Web Application or\n\n50\n00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.756\nWeb Vulnerability list that they\nput out is done every three years.\n\n51\n00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:37.745\nSo, the 2013 list would have been the one\nyou probably have heard me reference\n\n52\n00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:42.720\nin a lot of other shows, in other areas\nfor CASP, CIS, PES, CP, CEH, etc.\n\n53\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.990\nBecause those shows were shot back\nwhen the 2013 list was still active.\n\n54\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.216\nIt's active for three years so\nmiddle of 2016,\n\n55\n00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:55.570\nprobably around the summer time of\nthe third year that list is out.\n\n56\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.923\nSo going on three and a half years,\nOWASP goes out, puts together a request\n\n57\n00:02:59.923 --> 00:03:05.056\nessentially to the community to gather up\ninformation, start compiling the new list.\n\n58\n00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:08.960\nIt gets released probably around\nFebruary or March of the following year.\n\n59\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.519\nAnd so the 2017 list is currently out and\nreleased candidate form and\n\n60\n00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.625\nyou can go back and track backing\nsome of the earlier ones here.\n\n61\n00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:20.113\nWhen you click on this link to see\nthe 2017 list, you will see right here,\n\n62\n00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:21.718\nthis is what it looks like.\n\n63\n00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:26.673\nAnd you're able to go in and you're able\nto look at the information from this list.\n\n64\n00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.155\nAnd so hopefully nobody is scared of bugs.\n\n65\n00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:30.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you are,\n\n66\n00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:31.506\ndon't look at that particular page.\n\n67\n00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:35.966\nBut you could see here, let's just\nscroll down past first few pages,\n\n68\n00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.549\nthe introduction, the release notes.\n\n69\n00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.773\nFirst thing you'll see is a comparison\nchart between the older list,\n\n70\n00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:44.301\nthe top ten 2013 list,\nthe top ten 2017 list.\n\n71\n00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:48.900\nAnd you'll notice that the list is almost\nidentical, it has not shifted much.\n\n72\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.570\nWhat they've done is,\nand you can see here,\n\n73\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.565\nthey've taking missing function level\naccess control from the old 2013 list,\n\n74\n00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:59.900\nwhich would have A7,\nthe seventh item in the list.\n\n75\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.381\nIt's now been merged, as it says here,\nwith the new A4 item,\n\n76\n00:04:03.381 --> 00:04:06.679\nbroken access control,\nkind of incorporates all of that.\n\n77\n00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:10.890\nSo that has been added, so\nthat made some room on the list.\n\n78\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.235\nAnd then, two additional items\nhave been added here in purple,\n\n79\n00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:20.877\nInsufficient Attack Protection and also\nunprotected APIs, these are new areas.\n\n80\n00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:23.300\nAnd so,\nthese are gonna be the areas of focus.\n\n81\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.294\nThe reason I like the OWASP documentation,\nwhen you scroll down and\n\n82\n00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:31.973\nyou look at the list,\nthere's always a summary,\n\n83\n00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:36.111\nkind of a one page executive\noverview of all of the risk.\n\n84\n00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:40.260\nAnd as a result, just one, or\ntwo sentence description of what they are.\n\n85\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.020\nWe'll be going through this\nmaterial in a few minutes.\n\n86\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.849\nAnd then they break out\neach of the attacks for\n\n87\n00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.480\nyou, starting with,\nin this case, A1 Injection.\n\n88\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.031\nThey show you the threat agents,\nthe bad actors,\n\n89\n00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.150\nthe threat sources that will\nbe executing on these attacks.\n\n90\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.630\nThey rank the attack vector.\n\n91\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.261\nRed is going to be exploitability,\nit says here is going to be easy,\n\n92\n00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:03.910\nmeaning that's it's very easy to do,\nand undertake this attack.\n\n93\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.080\nSo, it's got a high ranking, in terms of\nthe potential for this attack to be used.\n\n94\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.992\nIt's very likely it will be executed.\n\n95\n00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:13.600\nThe security weakness,\nprevalence is very common.\n\n96\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.154\nDetectability is average, meaning it's\npretty common you see this and it is easy,\n\n97\n00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:21.350\nrelatively speaking,\nto find it when it does happen.\n\n98\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.062\nWhat's the technical impact?\n\n99\n00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:23.260\nImpact is severe.\n\n100\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.645\nWe get red would typically create in\nour minds an association with caution,\n\n101\n00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:30.050\nwarning danger, something is bad.\n\n102\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.696\nSo it's very significant when these\nattacks occur, because they are going to\n\n103\n00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:36.530\nhave a high likelihood that\nthey will impact us negatively.\n\n104\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.870\nAnd it talks a bit about\nthe business impacts over here.\n\n105\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.574\nIt gives you some information around\nevery one of these about whether you're\n\n106\n00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:45.120\nvulnerable, and if so, what is that\nvulnerability profile look like?\n\n107\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.600\nHow can you prevent these attacks?\n\n108\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.907\nAnd they give you some links to other\ndocuments and opportunities here to for\n\n109\n00:05:50.907 --> 00:05:53.293\nyou to do a little due diligence and\nexercise due care.\n\n110\n00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:56.364\nGo out and figure out more about\nwhy you may be vulnerable and\n\n111\n00:05:56.364 --> 00:05:58.890\nwhat steps you can take\nin order to prevent this.\n\n112\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.617\nGive you some example attack scenarios,\nin this case,\n\n113\n00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:05.050\nmaybe some attack code that may be\nused for one or more SQL injections.\n\n114\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.290\nYou'll come in SQL injections against\ntables that may dump the information for\n\n115\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.330\nuser accounts, passwords,\none of the case may be.\n\n116\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.592\nIf you haven't seen the CEH shows\nthat I've done, go back and\n\n117\n00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:18.870\ntake a look in our ITProTV library,\nthe current CEH content.\n\n118\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.345\nYou'll see a whole section in\nthere on injection attacks and\n\n119\n00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:26.050\nactually do a live injection\nattack against a SQL database.\n\n120\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.000\nWalk you through some of the SQL query\ncode that could be used to do that.\n\n121\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.500\nIn about five or six steps dump various\naspects of the database tables.\n\n122\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.090\nShow you the usernames,\npasswords, all that stuff.\n\n123\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.060\nSo we walk you through\nthe logic of that in that area.\n\n124\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.360\nSo you can obviously go cross reference\nthat knowledge, take a look at it.\n\n125\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.634\nAnd then they've got references\nto other areas that again will\n\n126\n00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.930\ngive us information that could be helpful.\n\n127\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.290\nSQL injection, prevention cheat sheet,\nquery, parameterization cheat sheet here.\n\n128\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.480\nThe command injection,\ninformation in an article.\n\n129\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.300\nThere's all this great resource\nthat is offered to you here.\n\n130\n00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.769\nAnd this is done for\neveryone in the attacks.\n\n131\n00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:05.692\nAnd you could see and there's ten of them\nsort of walks through these step by steps.\n\n132\n00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:09.910\nSo, definitely encourage you to go out and\ntake a look at this.\n\n133\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.640\nIt's a great reference document if you're\nnot familiar with OWASP I suggested at\n\n134\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.566\nthe top of the show.\n\n135\n00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:18.954\nIt's definitely time for you get familiar\nwith it because it can certainly be a very\n\n136\n00:07:18.954 --> 00:07:21.250\nbeneficial additional tool for you.\n\n137\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.068\nBoth from a resource prospective in terms\nof actionable items from a research\n\n138\n00:07:25.068 --> 00:07:28.301\nprospective and knowledge\nacquisition prospective from many,\n\n139\n00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:29.720\nmany different scenarios.\n\n140\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.030\nSo I wanna stat walking through\nsome of these with you.\n\n141\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.150\nAgain, we've got a very long lengthy list,\nnot just the top ten,\n\n142\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.560\nwe've incorporated those.\n\n143\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.830\nBut a lot of other items that are gonna be\non that list hat we have to be aware of.\n\n144\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.339\nAll of the stuff we're gonna\ntalk about is on our show notes.\n\n145\n00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.830\nEncourage you to go out, grab a copy of\nthose for any and all shows that we do.\n\n146\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.079\nBut especially for a show like this\nwhere we've got maybe 20 or so\n\n147\n00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.583\nitems listed with some\ndiscussion about each one.\n\n148\n00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:55.216\nI'm gonna summarize, we'll talk about it.\n\n149\n00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:57.377\nDan and I will have a little\ndialogue about things,\n\n150\n00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.892\nwe'll mention a couple of movies.\n\n151\n00:07:58.892 --> 00:08:00.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sit back perhaps,\n\n152\n00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.363\ntalk extra extemporaneously\nabout various things.\n\n153\n00:08:03.363 --> 00:08:05.767\nBut we will offer you\na lot of information.\n\n154\n00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.593\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n155\n00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:11.176\nAnd as a result, It'll give you\na nice little annotated study guide,\n\n156\n00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:15.304\nthat if you're gonna plan on preparing for\nthe exam, will give you the ability to\n\n157\n00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:19.312\ncreate flash cards from, directly or\nindirectly, use study notes, and or,\n\n158\n00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:22.569\nmake great stocking stuffers,\nby the way, for the holidays.\n\n159\n00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:24.350\nSo you could do that,\njust print that page and\n\n160\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.970\nthere you go look, I got a buffer overflow\nnote, that's so awesome, all right.\n\n161\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.253\nSo let's start talking\nabout some of these.\n\n162\n00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:34.101\nSo I know you certainly, we were talking\nabout in the last episode using injection\n\n163\n00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:36.269\nattacks, you do buffer overflow's\n&gt;&gt; I do\n\n164\n00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:36.781\n&gt;&gt; Things of that nature.\n\n165\n00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:41.219\nSo maybe you could start by telling the\nkind folk out there in our ITProTV studio\n\n166\n00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:41.910\naudience.\n\n167\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.360\nHow hard is it to do a buffer overflow and\nan injection?\n\n168\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.170\n&gt;&gt; How hard is it,\n\n169\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.350\nto do a buffer overflow is hard, that's no\njoke, it take a bit of time and effort.\n\n170\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.475\nThe concepts behind them is, if you\nunderstand the concepts behind them and\n\n171\n00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:57.860\nthe technicalities, learning those skills\nnot too difficult, it's the time and\n\n172\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.140\neffort it takes, to getting everything\njust right, is a bit difficult.\n\n173\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.090\nBut once you do that once, and you figured\nthat out, it's not hard after that.\n\n174\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:07.930\nSQL Injections,\n\n175\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.660\ninjection types of attacks,\nreally kind of stupid easy a lot of times.\n\n176\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.540\nIf you just know a few things and\n\n177\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.230\njust start throwing the spaghetti against\nthe wall, and seeing what sticks,\n\n178\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.690\na lot of times something sticks, and\nyou'll gain access to a machine.\n\n179\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.720\nThose typically are a whole lot\neasier than buffer overflows are.\n\n180\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.973\n&gt;&gt; So we talk about, and it's a great way\nto start thinking about the conversation,\n\n181\n00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:32.302\nbecause there are different\nlevels of skills, knowledge, and\n\n182\n00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:36.247\nto make it plain and simple, errors that\nhave to occur on the other side, for\n\n183\n00:09:36.247 --> 00:09:38.320\nthese attacks to be successful.\n\n184\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.020\nA lot of times injection\nattacks are successful,\n\n185\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.050\nbecause the database administrator,\nand let's be clear,\n\n186\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.370\nthis is a database focused attack, you\nare doing it through a web interface, but\n\n187\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.160\nyou are doing it against the database,\nthe database administrators, and\n\n188\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.800\nor the combination of the web and\ndatabase function administration.\n\n189\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.690\nThe two sides of the same\ncoin that are in charge here.\n\n190\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:05.026\nBut mainly the database side have not\nreally done their due diligence and\n\n191\n00:10:05.026 --> 00:10:09.926\nnot applied the proper controls and\ncounter measures necessary,\n\n192\n00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:15.899\nto prevent the use of and execution of,\nthe SQL, the structure query language.\n\n193\n00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:19.308\nQueries that are pushed through into\nthe database through the web interface,\n\n194\n00:10:19.308 --> 00:10:21.941\nto allow for unrestricted,\nuncontrolled, unvalidated,\n\n195\n00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:25.555\nunverified querying against data tables,\nthat most likely should not be accessed\n\n196\n00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:29.272\nthrough anything other than a secure web\ninterface, under a very tightly controlled\n\n197\n00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:33.120\nand scripted conditions, and because of\nthat, we're able to execute these attacks.\n\n198\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.942\nBuffer overflows, a lot of time,\nwill be the end result of an injection.\n\n199\n00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:40.722\nThere may be a multi-stop process, and\nso we may start with something easy,\n\n200\n00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:44.676\nlike Daniel was suggesting, an injection\nattack, which if we are successful,\n\n201\n00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:47.740\nwould certainly dump and\nprovide certain information.\n\n202\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.200\nBut we may then escalate\nthrough that attack,\n\n203\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.678\ninto other attacks that would become,\nas Daniel rightly said, more complicated,\n\n204\n00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:57.516\nmore complex,\nrequiring higher level of skill, and\n\n205\n00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:01.090\nthis is one of the things\ninvestigators have to be aware of.\n\n206\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.820\nDepending on ultimately what happens,\nthe compelling story we have to unwind,\n\n207\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.600\nverify, and ultimately learn how to tell,\nby reading the tea leaves or\n\n208\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.050\nrolling the proverbial bones,\nof what's left over, right?\n\n209\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.630\nAnd so you would have to, as an\ninvestigator, walk backwards in time and\n\n210\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.580\nlook at all the things that occurred\nagainst this web interface,\n\n211\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.800\nthrough into this database,\nand figure out the story.\n\n212\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.050\nAnd if you see evidence of buffer\noverflows, you know you're dealing with\n\n213\n00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.150\nsomebody who's much more\nknowledgeable as an attacker,\n\n214\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.440\nthan if you just see evidence of simply a\nSQL injection, or let's just say broadly,\n\n215\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.620\ninjection, command attacks,\nwhatever they may be.\n\n216\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.420\nTraditionally they're SQL injection\nattacks, but you may be injecting\n\n217\n00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.440\na variety of different kinds of code,\nlooking to see what will work.\n\n218\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.370\nBut whatever you do, with just\nthe evidence of SQL injection and\n\n219\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.940\nnothing more, what I'm thinking in my mind\nis, this is probably somebody who found\n\n220\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.570\nthe Google Hacks Database or\nfigured out Metasploit, or in other words,\n\n221\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.226\nsomebody who is probably\nnot very knowledgeable.\n\n222\n00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:01.970\nAnd as a result, I don't mean\nthis negatively by the way for\n\n223\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.090\nanybody who's listening,\nif this is what you do for\n\n224\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.090\na living, if you defend against this\nstuff, or if you're actively doing this,\n\n225\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.290\nwhatever you do as pen tester,\nthese are hard skills to come by.\n\n226\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.330\nI'm not suggesting for a minute,\nthat you haven't worked very hard and\n\n227\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.570\ndon't do valuable things.\n\n228\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.740\nWhat I'm simply pointing out is that\nan attacker that uses these skills,\n\n229\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.970\nmay not be as knowledgeable as somebody\nwho knows how to leverage them,\n\n230\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.615\ninto the next level of attack, like\na buffer overflow, to then gain access,\n\n231\n00:12:27.615 --> 00:12:31.800\nperhaps root-level access, which is\nwhat we ultimately want in the system,\n\n232\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.970\nby breaking one or more stacks,\nwe call it smashing the stack.\n\n233\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.410\nThat's what we often refer to it as.\n\n234\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.135\n&gt;&gt; For fun and profit.\n\n235\n00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:38.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For fun and profit, right.\n\n236\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.414\nAnd so, as a result of that, [CROSSTALK]\nthat would be a great blog, right?\n\n237\n00:12:42.414 --> 00:12:43.500\nSmashing stack for fun and profit.\n\n238\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you read smashing the stack for\nfun and profit,\n\n239\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.760\nit is a paper about buffer overflows.\n\n240\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm just thinking a blog.\n\n241\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.126\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just to do a blog about that.\n\n242\n00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:50.958\n&gt;&gt; Do a blog on buffer overflows?\n\n243\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:51.514\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; But that's how you like,\n\n244\n00:12:51.514 --> 00:12:54.540\nsmashing the stack for fun and profit\n&gt;&gt; It's a great title.\n\n245\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.420\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool.\n\n246\n00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.503\nBut you know the idea what we\nrefer to as smashing the stack,\n\n247\n00:12:58.503 --> 00:13:00.733\nis just kind of short\nhand in our industry.\n\n248\n00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:05.312\nFor breaking the management of\nmemory in the system open wide, and\n\n249\n00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:09.074\nallowing us to escape that\nisolation area and memory,\n\n250\n00:13:09.074 --> 00:13:12.725\nthat we're forced to run\nin as a validated process.\n\n251\n00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:18.090\nGaining some sort of command level access,\nand hopefully escalated superuser root\n\n252\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.020\nprivilege, whatever you wanna call it, in\nsuch a way, that we then can gain control,\n\n253\n00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.236\ndo other things and ultimately execute for\nfun and profit right?\n\n254\n00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:27.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Things we're lucky to do, and\n\n255\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.630\nso when I look forensically at\nan attack and I start to unwind it, and\n\n256\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.920\nI look for evidence of tale tell signs of\nthings, I'm looking not just at the point\n\n257\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.500\nof infection, I'm not just looking at the\noutcome, I'm looking around that system,\n\n258\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.240\nI'm looking around those known activities\n&gt;&gt; What stands out?\n\n259\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.360\nWhat's out of place?\n\n260\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.560\nWhat should be there, but is not, right?\n\n261\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.630\nLocard's principle of exchange,\nwe've talked about this early on.\n\n262\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.050\nSomebody has left something behind.\n\n263\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.570\nSomebody has taken something, that\nsomebody is traditionally a bad actor, and\n\n264\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.190\nso we're looking for that.\n\n265\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.710\nBut I'm also looking for evidence of other\nactivities, that on the surface may or\n\n266\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.890\nmay not seem obvious, but are gonna\ntell me a lot about the mindset and\n\n267\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.750\nthe skills,\nof the person who executed this attack.\n\n268\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.120\nAgain, if I find evidence\nof buffer overflows,\n\n269\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.630\nI'm thinking I'm dealing with\na whole different level of attacker,\n\n270\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.960\nthan I am if I see somebody who simply\nexecuted a SQL Command Injection.\n\n271\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.745\nProbably code they literally grabbed\noff the internet, on somebody's blog\n\n272\n00:14:20.745 --> 00:14:24.145\npage about how it works, and\njust hacked away, as Daniel was saying.\n\n273\n00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:27.145\nJust keep putting stuff in there\ntill something sticks, right?\n\n274\n00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:29.255\nThrow enough grains of\nrice against the wall.\n\n275\n00:14:29.255 --> 00:14:29.775\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; One or\n\n276\n00:14:29.775 --> 00:14:32.452\nmore of them are gonna land where\nthey're supposed to be, and\n\n277\n00:14:32.452 --> 00:14:38.072\nit's just that spray with a fire hose\nattack mechanism, is very effective.\n\n278\n00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:42.632\nI'm not saying it's not, but the point\nis when all you do is that, that's not\n\n279\n00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:46.796\nthe same as somebody who's surgically\ngoing in, and skillfully weaving their way\n\n280\n00:14:46.796 --> 00:14:51.066\nthrough a system, using a series of\nattacks that build on one another, and\n\n281\n00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:54.506\nare then gonna be able to get to\nsomething that's a lot more valuable,\n\n282\n00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:56.136\nthan just simply an account database,\nright?\n\n283\n00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:59.956\nAnd so that's something that you wanna\nthink about and just be aware of.\n\n284\n00:14:59.956 --> 00:15:01.956\nAnd so when we think about\nbuffer overflows, right?\n\n285\n00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:06.636\nThis occurs when an application fails\nto guard or somehow protect Its buffer,\n\n286\n00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:11.140\nits memory space, its caches,\nits registers, the things it's using,\n\n287\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.900\nto do its job every day,\nand that's what's going on.\n\n288\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.200\nWe allocate a certain amount of\nmemory to a process when it runs.\n\n289\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.300\nA memory is addressable,\nit's laid out in such a way that,\n\n290\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.730\nnot quite logically to us, right?\n\n291\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.470\nWe don't really thing of memory\naddresses as being logical.\n\n292\n00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.410\nThey are referenced through a series of\ncoordinates that essentially to us look\n\n293\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.925\nlike absolute garbage.\n\n294\n00:15:30.925 --> 00:15:33.770\nit's just hacks, but the machine,\n\n295\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.220\nit lays out a very specific path\nin order for blocks of memory and\n\n296\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.740\n64 kilobits chunks, or\nwhatever amount of memory we're accessing.\n\n297\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.950\nAnd as a result,\nthere is literally a map, Right?\n\n298\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.315\nThere is a path document that we can look\nfor, and as a machine interact with,\n\n299\n00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:53.016\nthat says these blocks of memory here,\nare allocated to the Daniel processor, and\n\n300\n00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:56.393\nthose blocks over there\nare allocated to another process.\n\n301\n00:15:56.393 --> 00:16:00.377\nThose two may or may not have rights to\nshare information between them, and so\n\n302\n00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.639\nwe may or may not allow them to talk,\nthrough other processes.\n\n303\n00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:04.867\nYou know everything has it's place, right?\n\n304\n00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:07.583\nIt's a very neatly organized Solution.\n\n305\n00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:09.955\nAnd when everything's running normally,\nthat's how things work.\n\n306\n00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:14.832\nBut, when things are not running normally,\nwhen the Daniel memory process sucks in\n\n307\n00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:20.120\nmore information than it's supposed to\nmanage, overflows its allocated space.\n\n308\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.170\nAnd does so in an incorrect way that\ncreates what we will call an exception,\n\n309\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.890\nin plain old fashion language,\nyou call that an error, right?\n\n310\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.870\nAnd when that error is not expected and\ntherefore not handled correctly,\n\n311\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.570\nthis is where the weakness of\nthe buffer overflow can come in.\n\n312\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.890\nWe may overflow a buffer just\nto normal operation of a system.\n\n313\n00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.952\nWe may process or be asked to process\nmore information than we can or should\n\n314\n00:16:44.952 --> 00:16:48.840\nbecause an application just does something\nstupid and essentially screws up.\n\n315\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.680\nProbably all had that happen.\n\n316\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.805\nSomething locks up you\never get that in Office?\n\n317\n00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:54.341\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Not responding.\n\n318\n00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:55.989\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just yeah kind of goes gray not\n\n319\n00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:56.878\nresponding right?\n\n320\n00:16:56.878 --> 00:16:59.472\nWe've all seen evidence of this,\nthis is not unusual.\n\n321\n00:16:59.472 --> 00:17:02.765\nYou could execute buffer overflows\nagainst renowned system if you try\n\n322\n00:17:02.765 --> 00:17:06.730\nhard enough without having to do anything\nthat approaches hacking the system.\n\n323\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.282\nYou just kinda open up\nseveral read applications and\n\n324\n00:17:09.282 --> 00:17:12.588\nstart doing a bunch of stuff that\nwants you'll chew up more memory,\n\n325\n00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:16.358\nthan they're actually use room in the\nsystem to allocate it any one time given\n\n326\n00:17:16.358 --> 00:17:18.750\nthe amount of stuff in\nthe processing keys.\n\n327\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.474\nAnd you may actually experience\nmomentary locks or momentary areas or\n\n328\n00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:26.767\ntime spans where there\nmay not be enough memory.\n\n329\n00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:30.407\nAnd if you keep pushing something\nmay crash as opposed to overflowing\n\n330\n00:17:30.407 --> 00:17:34.423\nthe buffer cuz the logical behavior\nis hey, let's stop, let's figure out\n\n331\n00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:38.348\nwhat's going on there, let's get as\nmuch in and out as quickly as we can.\n\n332\n00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:39.800\nAnd let's queue staff up so\n\n333\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.550\nthat we can then process in\nthe memory buffers as we have room.\n\n334\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.500\nAnd as long as we even out that\nflow more or less, right staff,\n\n335\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.128\nin staff out, more or less that works and\nif there's little stuff backed up\n\n336\n00:17:50.128 --> 00:17:53.850\nin the queue no big deal, too much stuff\nbacked up not enough processing and\n\n337\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.270\nthings lock up on the street.\n\n338\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.090\nThat's traditional behaviors,\nthere's nothing wrong with that, right?\n\n339\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.870\nShouldn't do that of course, but\nthat is traditional behavior.\n\n340\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.920\nBut a buffer overflow takes that to\nthe next level, purposefully cramming so\n\n341\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.950\nmuch stuff in there in such a little\namount of time that we overwhelm\n\n342\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.900\nthe protective capabilities of the system.\n\n343\n00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.230\nTo queue, to buffer, to pause,\nto essentially say hey wait a second I'm\n\n344\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.310\ngonna take a break here,\nI'm not responding for a minute.\n\n345\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.980\nAnd we just crashed the system\nas a result of that.\n\n346\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.644\nNow, if we crash a system and the system\nstops working, that turns into a denial or\n\n347\n00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:26.151\na distributed denial service depending\non who's doing it and from where, and\n\n348\n00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:28.458\nthat maybe the end game and\nthe end result, right?\n\n349\n00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:30.450\nWe may just want to\ntake down that machine.\n\n350\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.098\nSo if that's the case, buffer overflows\nmay lead to denial of service, and\n\n351\n00:18:34.098 --> 00:18:36.959\nthat's in theory okay from\nthe attacker's perspective.\n\n352\n00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:40.415\nBut what often would happen is the\nattacker doesn't wanna crash the machine\n\n353\n00:18:40.415 --> 00:18:43.277\nbecause we could do that in\na variety of ways that don't require\n\n354\n00:18:43.277 --> 00:18:44.570\na buffer overflows.\n\n355\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.995\nWhat we really want is we want the ability\nto be able to get out of that buffer,\n\n356\n00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:53.700\nthat memory space, into a command prompt\nor another adjacent area, where we can\n\n357\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.705\nthen execute other code, use additional\ncredentials, or escalate our privilege.\n\n358\n00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:02.311\nPrivilege escalation attacks are often\nthe link in the chain that come\n\n359\n00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:04.155\ndirectly after buffer overflows.\n\n360\n00:19:04.155 --> 00:19:08.009\nSo, a buffer overflow will typically and\nwell for the attacker when they\n\n361\n00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:12.383\ncan escalate privilege or SU as you've\nheard us talk about super user up, right?\n\n362\n00:19:12.383 --> 00:19:16.372\nSo they will essentially execute\nthat particular command underneath\n\n363\n00:19:16.372 --> 00:19:20.237\nanother guise, another account looking for\nenhanced privilege.\n\n364\n00:19:20.237 --> 00:19:22.647\nAnd therefore has the ability\nto root the machine.\n\n365\n00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:26.307\nAnd so often times we'll see something\nlike a SQL injection perhaps leading to\n\n366\n00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:28.777\none or\nmore opportunities to buffer overflow.\n\n367\n00:19:28.777 --> 00:19:33.250\nPerhaps then a privilege escalation attack\nto then root the machine, placing malware,\n\n368\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.460\ntypically root gets in, perhaps\nremote access Trojans that allow us\n\n369\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.860\nto come back to that machine at will now\nhaving a dedicated command channel, what\n\n370\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.290\nwe call a covert channel, back door and\nallowing us to talk to that machine and\n\n371\n00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.470\ngain control of it in\nadministrative level.\n\n372\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.840\nThis is the progressive path that\na knowledgeable attacker will\n\n373\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.410\ntypically tend to follow.\n\n374\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.890\nAnd of course all along the way\nobfuscate and stealth their activities.\n\n375\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.630\nHide evidence of what they did so that\nit's not obvious that we have a back door.\n\n376\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.942\nIt's not obvious that there's\na root kit installed right?\n\n377\n00:20:03.942 --> 00:20:07.080\nEven on reboot those root\nkits are resident typically.\n\n378\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.780\nCuz they may load into memory but they're\nprobably sitting in the hard drive.\n\n379\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.930\nAnd so they'll respawn and reconnect and\n\n380\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.334\ntherefore open up that\ncovert channel again.\n\n381\n00:20:14.334 --> 00:20:17.310\nAnd so\nis kinda the progression we look at.\n\n382\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.680\nSo, buffer overflows can happen just\nby accident, without you meaning to.\n\n383\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.100\nBut when you mean to set them off,\nwe have to think about the fact\n\n384\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.930\nif we allow writing into memory\nspace beyond its allocated size.\n\n385\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.866\nAs a direct correlative\nevent to bad coding.\n\n386\n00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:35.090\nAnd let's be clear about how\nbuffer overflows can happen.\n\n387\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.140\nApplications can be written in good ways,\nand\n\n388\n00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.510\nthey could be written in not so\ngood ways, right?\n\n389\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.430\nAnd so if the code that is written for\nthat application for\n\n390\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.580\nwhatever reason has not been validated\nproperly, and things can slip by,\n\n391\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.480\nnot that somebody does it on purpose, just\nmaybe an accident, the code may not have\n\n392\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.710\nbeen tested properly,\nthe code today is relatively complex.\n\n393\n00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.008\nI mean, think about the millions of lines\nof code to make up a modern operating\n\n394\n00:20:59.008 --> 00:20:59.840\nsystems, right?\n\n395\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.920\nAnd so, validating all of the activities,\ninteractions,\n\n396\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.270\nand the cross referencing of things in\na certain way is very difficult to do.\n\n397\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.460\nYou have five lines of code,\n\n398\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.660\nyou could turn that thing all around in\nall sorts of different ways, examine it,\n\n399\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.210\nhack it up into pieces and put it\nback together again, and you're gonna\n\n400\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.660\npretty much know what it does in every\npossible permutation what it does.\n\n401\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.298\nYou got 500 million lines of code?\n\n402\n00:21:21.298 --> 00:21:22.030\nGood luck, right?\n\n403\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.130\nYou might as well not even attempt\nit because you're just not gonna\n\n404\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.280\nfigure it all out.\n\n405\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.560\nAnd so, as a result,\n\n406\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.590\nwhen applications are allowing us to\nwrite beyond the allocated memory space,\n\n407\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.150\nthat's the space we're looking for\nfor buffer overflows to happen.\n\n408\n00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.100\nAnd that is directly\ncorrelated to bad coding.\n\n409\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.110\nI mean, I'm not suggesting that\ndevelopers aren't doing a good job.\n\n410\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.060\nI'm simply pointing out that because\nwe haven't tested the code properly and\n\n411\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.440\nallowed something who occur that\nshould not be allowed to occur,\n\n412\n00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.770\nbuffer overflows are possible.\n\n413\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.380\nAnd that's why they occur.\n\n414\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.600\nMultiple different forms\nof buffer overflows.\n\n415\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.610\nWe look at heat buffer overflows,\n\n416\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.730\nlook at format string attacks,\nlots of different ones that occur.\n\n417\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.620\nThere's probably a massive list\nyou have at your disposal,\n\n418\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:22:03.177 --> 00:22:04.189\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure beyond the obvious\n\n420\n00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:04.741\nones, right?\n\n421\n00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:08.136\nBut these attacks look to corrupt\nthe execution stack of a web application.\n\n422\n00:22:08.136 --> 00:22:11.735\nThat is what they do and as a result\nof that, remember, if we knock that\n\n423\n00:22:11.735 --> 00:22:15.579\napplication, that service, that process,\nthat memory address space,\n\n424\n00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:19.150\nthat resource pull,\nit's referred to a lot of different ways.\n\n425\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.750\nWe can knock that over, and then wind up\nsomewhere as a result of that outside\n\n426\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.320\nof that contained vessel,\nthen the fun begins, right.\n\n427\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.360\nBecause then we can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n428\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.100\nDirect root traversal attacks.\n\n429\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.880\nWe could escalation of privilege,\nwe could do a lot of different things\n\n430\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.670\nincluding turning that system on itself,\nyou're and essentially making it into\n\n431\n00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.500\nan operational platform as I suggested for\nlaunching further attacks,\n\n432\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.110\nreckoning and going out and\nlooking at the lay of land of the network.\n\n433\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.020\nAnd then selectively targeting systems\nfrom that platform because now we\n\n434\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.610\nhave control over it, and this is one of\nthe things we have to be concerned about.\n\n435\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.960\nAnd think about the logic of this right,\n\n436\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.605\neven if this box is sitting in the DMZ\nwhere many web servers will sit,\n\n437\n00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:03.735\nbecause we don't want them on the inside\nof our networks serving up content to\n\n438\n00:23:03.735 --> 00:23:08.135\noutside individuals from an internally,\nhighly secured environment.\n\n439\n00:23:08.135 --> 00:23:12.363\nSo, we will put these publicly\nfacing web servers out in DMZs.\n\n440\n00:23:12.363 --> 00:23:14.545\nRight, we wanna somewhat shield them,\nsomewhat protect them,\n\n441\n00:23:14.545 --> 00:23:19.425\nbut we want them also somewhat set\noff from the inside databases and\n\n442\n00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:21.690\nthe inside systems that\nthey are referencing.\n\n443\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.298\nSo we put them in a DMZ, we open\ncertain ports in the outside firewall,\n\n444\n00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:29.212\ntraditionally 80 and 443, coming in\nto connect to the web server, and\n\n445\n00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:33.001\nthen we open up other ports behind the web\nserver in the back end of the DMZ to\n\n446\n00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:34.815\nallow for database interaction.\n\n447\n00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:39.747\nPort 1433 has to be open for the SQL\ndatabase, the Microsoft SQL database,\n\n448\n00:23:39.747 --> 00:23:41.710\nto talk to an IS web server.\n\n449\n00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.430\nThat'll be open on the internal firewall,\nbut not on the external firewall, right?\n\n450\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.320\nSo we don't allow direct access.\n\n451\n00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.343\nWell good, that makes sense.\n\n452\n00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:52.566\nBut once we gain access to the web server,\nwe can access to all the communication\n\n453\n00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:56.980\nchannels and ports that are available to\nit, now we can start launching SQL command\n\n454\n00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.270\ninjection attacks freely through the\nfirewall because what should be allowed to\n\n455\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.385\ngo Is this exact kinda traffic\nthat we're talking about?\n\n456\n00:24:04.385 --> 00:24:07.120\nWould it be easy to\nlaunch it from outside?\n\n457\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.920\nNot as easy but\n\n458\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.337\nit will be a lot easier if we're already\non the inside of the DMC owning the box.\n\n459\n00:24:12.337 --> 00:24:15.459\nAnd so this is why we have to\nthink about this as a multistep,\n\n460\n00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:19.180\nmultipronged set of attacks that\nare gonna build on each other.\n\n461\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.894\nAnd if we're not looking for\nthat as an investigator,\n\n462\n00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:24.609\nwe're missing a very large\nslot of the story, right?\n\n463\n00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:27.470\nHow hard is it to detect if you've\ndone it successfully, right?\n\n464\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.560\nIf you've done it successfully.\n\n465\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.112\nHow hard would it be for us to detect one\nof the buffer overflows that you're using?\n\n466\n00:24:32.112 --> 00:24:32.661\n&gt;&gt; Buffer overflow?\n\n467\n00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:34.937\nWell, it depends on how well\nI wrote my buffer overflow.\n\n468\n00:24:34.937 --> 00:24:38.986\nIf I did it poorly or quickly, it would\nbe very easy to detect cuz it'd crash\n\n469\n00:24:38.986 --> 00:24:41.580\nthe server and\nyou would see the server is down.\n\n470\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.844\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's logs, things like that.\n&gt;&gt; Right if I did it\n\n471\n00:24:42.844 --> 00:24:47.215\nsafely You would probably have a hard time\ndetecting that I was gaining access in and\n\n472\n00:24:47.215 --> 00:24:49.587\nout of the box,\nbecause to you, the server,\n\n473\n00:24:49.587 --> 00:24:52.897\nunless you were checking logs\non a regular basis, alerting for\n\n474\n00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:56.909\ncertain type of criteria, you're not\ngonna know that I've been in there.\n\n475\n00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:57.710\n&gt;&gt; And we'd have to check specific logs.\n\n476\n00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.069\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not just say the web server log,\n\n477\n00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:00.744\noverall.\n\n478\n00:25:00.744 --> 00:25:02.674\nWe'd have to look at the audit logs,\n\n479\n00:25:02.674 --> 00:25:05.613\nspecifically the access\ncontrol elements of that log.\n\n480\n00:25:05.613 --> 00:25:08.090\nCuz we'd have to look at what accounts for\nuse?\n\n481\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.540\nWhat processes are being spawned, right?\n\n482\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.779\nAnd what they're doing?\n\n483\n00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:15.553\nAnd this involves several different logs\nas you'll see as we get further into our\n\n484\n00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:19.070\ndiscussions than we talked about\nwhere distinct logs are by version.\n\n485\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.780\nGotta list a different default\nlog pass for you, you know Linux,\n\n486\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.880\nMac, Windows, whatever the case maybe.\n\n487\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.690\nAnd so we put that out there for you But\n\n488\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.860\nyou've gotta correlate\nall this information.\n\n489\n00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.246\nAnd Daniel made an excellent\npoint which is you know,\n\n490\n00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:33.685\ndepending on how well the buffer\nover flow is crafted,\n\n491\n00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:36.880\ncan we keep coming back to this idea\nof how well the software is written.\n\n492\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.776\nThat's really one of\nthe most important things,\n\n493\n00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:40.710\nwe have to think about as an investigator.\n\n494\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.030\nIf the attacker has done their job, and\nreally knows what they're doing, they're\n\n495\n00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:51.150\ngonna write code that is gonna go in, and\njust literally with a file laser focus.\n\n496\n00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.790\nSlice off just what they need,\nnothing more and really do minimal,\n\n497\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.488\nif any collateral damage.\n\n498\n00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:59.110\nThe tell tale evidence of, in other words,\n\n499\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.280\nthe blast radius of the attack\nis what we're looking at.\n\n500\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.625\nWhen somebody downloads one of these\nprepackaged exploits off the web that they\n\n501\n00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:08.990\ndon't know how to operate and\nthat somebody put together.\n\n502\n00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.810\nAnd they just pull the pin on the grenade\nand hopefully it does its job.\n\n503\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.250\nWe're gonna find a lot of\ncollateral damage typically,\n\n504\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.710\nbecause those attack packages, while\nthey're probably gonna be successful,\n\n505\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.660\nare gonna leave behind a lot of additional\ninformation forensically that's valuable\n\n506\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.100\nfor us,\ncuz they're not typically clean code.\n\n507\n00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.940\nThey're not written and\noptimized to be easily exploitable, right.\n\n508\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.041\nTo be easily exploitable is not the same\nthing as being written to be optimized and\n\n509\n00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:33.868\nrun in stealth mode.\n\n510\n00:26:33.868 --> 00:26:35.714\nAnd so typically they're very noisy and\n\n511\n00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:38.055\nthey're gonna cause a lot\nof additional fallout.\n\n512\n00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:40.500\nAnd we could see evidence of\nthat if we know where to look.\n\n513\n00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.209\nBut, a very well written overflow is\ngonna be something that may execute,\n\n514\n00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:49.918\nit may never be found because it's so\nfinely optimized, so finely tuned to\n\n515\n00:26:49.918 --> 00:26:54.878\noperate inside that smashed stack,\nthat additional environment we create.\n\n516\n00:26:54.878 --> 00:26:57.946\nThat it may leave behind next to new\ntraits and may be very difficult for\n\n517\n00:26:57.946 --> 00:26:59.355\nus to reconstruct the attacks.\n\n518\n00:26:59.355 --> 00:27:01.867\nSo kudos for you sir if you're\nwriting that kinda code and\n\n519\n00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:05.075\nremind me never to let you near my\nweb server if that's the case, right?\n\n520\n00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:05.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n521\n00:27:05.741 --> 00:27:07.474\nwe do wanna think about buffer overflows.\n\n522\n00:27:07.474 --> 00:27:09.603\nWhat about things like cookie poison,\n\n523\n00:27:09.603 --> 00:27:13.680\nwe talked a lot about cookies I happened\nto like the raisin cookies myself.\n\n524\n00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.787\n&gt;&gt; It's my favorite.\n\n525\n00:27:14.787 --> 00:27:15.898\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nespecially when they're just fresh.\n\n526\n00:27:15.898 --> 00:27:17.690\n&gt;&gt; They're amazing.\n\n527\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.910\nThat is such a good cookie.\n\n528\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.200\n&gt;&gt; So by one week,\nI said do not eat sweets in general.\n\n529\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.475\nI mean, it's not at all a sweet person but\n\n530\n00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.940\nfresh homemade-\n&gt;&gt; Oatmeal raisin.\n\n531\n00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.911\n&gt;&gt; Oatmeal raisin.\nBoy, that's the bomb, quote unquote,\n\n532\n00:27:27.911 --> 00:27:28.800\nright there.\n\n533\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.931\nNo pun intended, right?\n\n534\n00:27:29.931 --> 00:27:33.061\nSo cookie poisoning,\nnot the kinda cookies we're talking about.\n\n535\n00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:36.130\nBut those little pesky TXT\nfiles that are left behind.\n\n536\n00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.376\nResident on systems that store in cache\ncredentials so that it is easier,\n\n537\n00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:44.962\nput that in air quotes right easier, for\nus to log in, really not easier for us,\n\n538\n00:27:44.962 --> 00:27:49.069\nit is easier for the person who owns\nthe website to draw us back in right so\n\n539\n00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:50.937\nwe will come back and do things.\n\n540\n00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:54.864\nBut cookies, while they are potentially,\nperhaps, valuable to you as a user,\n\n541\n00:27:54.864 --> 00:27:56.910\nI don't typically care for them.\n\n542\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.779\nI look at them as a very negative\nconsequence of using the web,\n\n543\n00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:01.779\nbecause they're valuable to attackers.\n\n544\n00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:04.952\nCuz they gave us as attackers\nthe ability to be able to go in and\n\n545\n00:28:04.952 --> 00:28:09.140\nto impersonate you and to spoof and\nmasquerade and all sorts of other stuff.\n\n546\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.880\nThey give us a wealth of information,\nin other words.\n\n547\n00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.028\nAs investigators,\nwe certainly wanna look for\n\n548\n00:28:14.028 --> 00:28:16.399\ncookies cuz they do give\nus a wealth of information.\n\n549\n00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:19.276\nBut cookie poisoning is a big deal, right?\n\n550\n00:28:19.276 --> 00:28:24.455\nWe can modify or somehow manipulate\ncookies to bypass the security measures,\n\n551\n00:28:24.455 --> 00:28:28.541\ngaining unauthorized access to\ninformation on a web server.\n\n552\n00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:33.008\nMasquerading and spoofing is kind of at\nthe front of this thought process, and so\n\n553\n00:28:33.008 --> 00:28:35.220\nif we see evidence of logging in.\n\n554\n00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.874\nAnd we see evidence of use of credentials\nwhen somebody swears that it couldn't have\n\n555\n00:28:38.874 --> 00:28:42.486\nbeen them cuz they were away on vacation\nand didn't touch a computer for two weeks.\n\n556\n00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:46.218\nFirst thing in my mind I'm thinking\nokay either someone got the identity or\n\n557\n00:28:46.218 --> 00:28:47.945\nsomehow spoofed or masqueraded.\n\n558\n00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:49.320\nI'm gonna go look for cookies.\n\n559\n00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.910\nI'm gonna go look for a lot of stuff.\n\n560\n00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.504\nWhere am I gonna find\nthose cache credentials?\n\n561\n00:28:52.504 --> 00:28:54.010\nIs there evidence of tampering?\n\n562\n00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.510\nIs there evidence of access to those logs?\n\n563\n00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.283\nIs there evidence of\naccess to those caches?\n\n564\n00:28:58.283 --> 00:29:01.520\nAnd if there is I wanna track\nback right or trace back.\n\n565\n00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.598\nI wanna find out where it came from\nbecause that's what I'm looking for.\n\n566\n00:29:04.598 --> 00:29:06.410\nWhat about things like insecure storage?\n\n567\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.517\nI mentioned this for\n\n568\n00:29:07.517 --> 00:29:11.099\ninstance in the beginning of our\nconversations when talked about\n\n569\n00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:15.802\nthe potentiality of an attacker breaking\nthrough into our virtual infrastructure.\n\n570\n00:29:15.802 --> 00:29:19.230\nGoing after our storage area network,\nor our network attached storage.\n\n571\n00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.733\nSAN or NAS systems are locally attached\nstorage if we're using just hard drives on\n\n572\n00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:24.328\nthe host.\n\n573\n00:29:24.328 --> 00:29:29.360\nAnd, grabbing our VHDX or\nour flat VMDK files.\n\n574\n00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.530\nMaybe being able to grab\nour snapshot files.\n\n575\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.750\nMaybe being able to grab\nour template files.\n\n576\n00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.860\nAnd, then loading them up,\nthat's just bulk data in one of our\n\n577\n00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.330\ninvestigative tools, and\npulling data right out of the images.\n\n578\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.305\nWe've talked about this and\nwhy this is a problem.\n\n579\n00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:47.370\nSensitive information is\nabounding in our storage networks.\n\n580\n00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:52.190\nWe've got spreadsheets, we've got account\ndatabases, we've got just who knows what,\n\n581\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.980\nemail, there's all sorts of stuff,\nright, that's gonna be sitting in there.\n\n582\n00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.410\nImagine all the stuff we could go out and\nfind, an upcoming episodes and\n\n583\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.565\nshows we'll take a look at how we\ninvestigate email based attacks.\n\n584\n00:30:02.565 --> 00:30:06.180\nAnd looking at things like PST and\nOST files, loading them up and\n\n585\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.150\nreading people's email.\n\n586\n00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.360\nI'll show you how to do that,\nnot very hard to do at all.\n\n587\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.730\nI will take a look at, or\n\n588\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.950\nwe will take a look at in upcoming\nconversations about data based forensics.\n\n589\n00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.485\nWe'll dump a database, a SQLLite database.\n\n590\n00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:20.509\nWe'll take a look at it with one of\nthe tools that allow us to go in and\n\n591\n00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:21.330\ninvestigate it.\n\n592\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.830\nWe'll load the database tables up.\n\n593\n00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.710\nAnd sit right there right in front of you.\n\n594\n00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.790\nYou'll see URLs, you'll see user accounts,\n\n595\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.400\nyou'll see all sorts of stuff just\nwaiting for yu to come in and grab.\n\n596\n00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.610\nSo as an investigator I can find all that.\n\n597\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.510\nRemember if investigators can find it,\nso can bad actors, right?\n\n598\n00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.870\nIt's not a leap of faith to assume if\nthey're gonna use same kinda resources.\n\n599\n00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.860\nSame kinda tool same kinda\nknowledge that we have.\n\n600\n00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.201\nSo if there is insecure storage,\nphysically or illogically,\n\n601\n00:30:45.201 --> 00:30:49.233\nsomeone can walk in right behind me\nhere let's say, to the server room, and\n\n602\n00:30:49.233 --> 00:30:53.601\ngain access to that infrastructure and\nplug in a drive they can download content.\n\n603\n00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.461\nIf they can get through our defences,\ncross VLANs,\n\n604\n00:30:56.461 --> 00:31:00.556\ncreate an open connection to systems\nunder normally supposed off limits,\n\n605\n00:31:00.556 --> 00:31:05.070\nthen they can break physically or\nlogically, we end up with the same issue.\n\n606\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:09.291\nThe best thing we can do to defend against\ninsecure storage is to encrypt data.\n\n607\n00:31:09.291 --> 00:31:13.110\nWe've talked a lot about this and\nwhy this is so critical.\n\n608\n00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.250\nBut as an investigator, if we see\nencrypted data and we can't decrypt\n\n609\n00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.080\nit to understand whether it's been\nmodified, or not, we have a problem.\n\n610\n00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.610\nWe can't tell whether\nthe data has integrity,\n\n611\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.960\nwe don't understand whether\nthe data has been secured properly.\n\n612\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.300\nRemember crypter attacks are actually\nattacks that will seek to encrypt data and\n\n613\n00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.130\nhold it for ransom.\n\n614\n00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.015\nYou commonly call these ransom attacks,\nright?\n\n615\n00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:35.883\nSo an attacker,\ntheir main purpose may be to go in,\n\n616\n00:31:35.883 --> 00:31:40.424\ngrab hold of the storage network, encrypt\nthe entire contents fo that network,\n\n617\n00:31:40.424 --> 00:31:44.627\nor at least all the files they can get\ntheir hands on and then grab that key and\n\n618\n00:31:44.627 --> 00:31:46.735\nransom it back to the organization.\n\n619\n00:31:46.735 --> 00:31:49.600\nIf we have to investigate\nthat kind of an attack.\n\n620\n00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.970\nBreaking the encryption would\nobviously solve the problem, but\n\n621\n00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.920\nwe may not be able to\nbreak that encryption.\n\n622\n00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.672\nSo we may now have to say,\nyeah, definitively, clearly,\n\n623\n00:31:56.672 --> 00:31:57.891\ndata's been encrypted.\n\n624\n00:31:57.891 --> 00:32:00.431\nWe don't have a way of understanding that.\n\n625\n00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:03.149\nAll we know is that it\nseems like this IP address.\n\n626\n00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:07.155\nRight, was what was used to enter\nthe system and this is how they got there.\n\n627\n00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:09.070\nThis seems to be what they did.\n\n628\n00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.510\nIf we wanna get back at the data,\neither you pay or we have to have a backup\n\n629\n00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.284\nperhaps, hopefully available somewhere,\nand we can blow this data up, and\n\n630\n00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:19.850\nessentially turn it off, or forget about\nit, and restore data back to, I don't\n\n631\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:24.380\nknow, 48 hours ago, whatever it was and we\ncan then simply just do away with this and\n\n632\n00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.800\nforget about it because we're just gonna\npretend that the data never existed.\n\n633\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.120\nYes, we have to understand the logic\nof what we're looking at here.\n\n634\n00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.900\nMistakes with applying encryption can\nbe problematic from a confidentiality\n\n635\n00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.660\nstandpoint, mistakes when applying\nencryption from an investigative\n\n636\n00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.410\nstandpoint may tell us certain things\nabout the nature of the attack.\n\n637\n00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.250\nSo we do have to understand that, right?\n\n638\n00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.609\nInformation leakage, also very important.\n\n639\n00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.830\nThe unintentional or perhaps intentional\nrevelation of sensitive information to\n\n640\n00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.170\nunauthorized users.\n\n641\n00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.170\nMaybe we are able to exfiltrate\ndata out of the system.\n\n642\n00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.930\nThere was this case just recently\nwith this young lady from the NSA,\n\n643\n00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.160\nas a contractor right in\nthe United States anyway,\n\n644\n00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.460\nwho was accused of sending sensitive data\nto one or more news outlets to be able\n\n645\n00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.080\nto expose some activities that were going\non, just recently made the news, right?\n\n646\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.190\nThat kind of thing does\nnot occur often but\n\n647\n00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.625\nit seems to be occurring with more\nfrequency and regularity these days.\n\n648\n00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:18.805\nAnd that's one example\nof information leakage.\n\n649\n00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:21.425\nCould be something as simple as\nleaving system documentation\n\n650\n00:33:21.425 --> 00:33:24.555\nunprotected on an open share,\nallowing an attacker\n\n651\n00:33:24.555 --> 00:33:28.164\nthrough reconnaissance to be able to\nfigure out how to get into a system and\n\n652\n00:33:28.164 --> 00:33:31.912\nmap out your network, there's all these\nexamples of information leakage, right?\n\n653\n00:33:31.912 --> 00:33:35.128\nIt may just be social engineering,\nsomebody may overhear a conversation about\n\n654\n00:33:35.128 --> 00:33:37.720\nsystem and how it's being setup and\nwhat's being used for, and\n\n655\n00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.220\nthey may get curious and\nstart figuring out how to get into it.\n\n656\n00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.697\nI mean you just, you don't even stop and\n\n657\n00:33:41.697 --> 00:33:43.740\nthink about the stuff that we do today,\nright.\n\n658\n00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.340\nThere's all sorts of different things,\nbut we're gonna continue through\n\n659\n00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.920\nthis conversation as I said, there's a lot\nof things on this list, we've only really\n\n660\n00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.740\ntalked about the first four or so that are\non this list and we have a lot more to go.\n\n661\n00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.450\nBut I think we're gonna have to come\nback and continue that conversation.\n\n662\n00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right we're gonna\ncontinue that cuz we have plenty and\n\n663\n00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.270\nmore topics to cover.\n\n664\n00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.240\nI know we're taking a bit of a high level\noverview of these different vulnerability\n\n665\n00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.020\naspects of any web enabled system.\n\n666\n00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.950\nBut if you want a deeper look,\n\n667\n00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.572\nyou can definitely checkout our\npenetration testing shows, our CEH shows.\n\n668\n00:34:11.572 --> 00:34:12.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes.\n\n669\n00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.670\n&gt;&gt; We go into in depth, and\n\n670\n00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.280\nhands on looks at a lot of how this is\ndone especially in the pen testing show.\n\n671\n00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.990\nI'll actually show you how to do buffer\nover flows and things of that nature.\n\n672\n00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:22.180\nSo, if that interests\nyou check that out but\n\n673\n00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.778\nother than that continue watching\nwith us so you can get that CHFI.\n\n674\n00:34:25.778 --> 00:34:30.210\nJoining our, okay, I guess it looks\nlike it's, like we said time has gone.\n\n675\n00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's elapsed.\n\n676\n00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.100\nIt's expired, we're out of it.\n\n677\n00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.300\nSo, we're gonna have to sign off.\n\n678\n00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.960\nFor ITPRO.TV, thanks for watching.\n\n679\n00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.530\nI've been

00:00:08.908\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.296\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:13.801\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.970\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.344\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:23.740\nin today's episode it is more on our CHFI\nversion 9 series, a lot of fun so far.\n\n9\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.890\nJoining us back in the studio to\ncontinue our conversation on web attacks\n\n10\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.393\nis our good friend Mr. Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:31.657\nAdam, great to have you again,\nhow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:34.183\n&gt;&gt; Asia TV response code, 404.\n\n13\n00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:37.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Error not found response, acceptable.\n\n14\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.830\nIt's going well, in case you don't\nspeak HTTP Response code or HTML.\n\n15\n00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.560\nIt's going well,\nhopefully going well for all of you.\n\n16\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.289\nWe're gonna jump right back in, continue\nour conversations with regards to the hand\n\n17\n00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.423\nlist of all things we have to be\nconsidering from the web perspectives.\n\n18\n00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.210\nSpecifically, attacks that could be\nused against our web real estate.\n\n19\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.650\nAnd as a result, things we should be aware\nof to defend and obviously to investigate.\n\n20\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.520\nFollowing jump back in with a quick little\ndemonstration, not quite a hands-on but\n\n21\n00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420\na show and tell if you will.\n\n22\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.226\nWe're up to improper error\nhandling in our list and\n\n23\n00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.410\nI thought what better way to do\nwith improper error handling.\n\n24\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.241\nAnd form validation and form tampering,\nthen perhaps to talk about, I don't know,\n\n25\n00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.350\na website that may have forms, right?\n\n26\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.935\nSo I just picked the Amazon that's\nnot because Amazon is vulnerable,\n\n27\n00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:19.825\nnot because it's not.\n\n28\n00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:23.205\nJust because it's a website that I would\nthink without exception almost everybody\n\n29\n00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:25.845\nlistening to us has probably\nbeen to at some point.\n\n30\n00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:28.523\nAnd if you haven't, you would certainly\nbe familiar with it nonetheless.\n\n31\n00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:32.937\nSo, when we go to a website, any kind\nof website that has an authentication\n\n32\n00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:36.872\nform something like this,\nadd a portal where you asked to sign in.\n\n33\n00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:41.092\nOr perhaps providing some mid information\nyou probably been to a lot of this sites.\n\n34\n00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:44.480\nSay hey, I wanna download that white\npaper I wanna, download that software.\n\n35\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.990\nWhatever the case may be, and\n\n36\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.350\nthere's a form you gotta fill out in order\nto put your information in, get access to\n\n37\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.160\nthe download, that stuff gets vacuumed\nright across the divide into a database.\n\n38\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.560\nAnd that form is essentially lined up to\nmatch tables, and specifically rows and\n\n39\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.930\ncolumns in the table that will provide\naccess to you entering your data,\n\n40\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.310\nbased on mapping those form fields.\n\n41\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.250\nThat's traditionally how this is done.\n\n42\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.640\nAnd so when we go in and\nwe provide information,\n\n43\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.270\nlike we would at the Amazon\nsign-in page here, email, right?\n\n44\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.153\nIf it's a mobile account put in\nyour phone number and/or password.\n\n45\n00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:22.374\nWhat we think about with improper\nhandling what we would call un-handled or\n\n46\n00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.180\nunexpected exceptions.\n\n47\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330\nExceptions, if you remember\nfrom the last episode,\n\n48\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.718\njust a fancy term we use\nto talk about errors.\n\n49\n00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.810\nSo un-handled exception is a bad error or\n\n50\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.460\nan error that we did not anticipate and\ndid not handle correctly.\n\n51\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.156\nAnd so if I was to put in either a mobile\naccount number or an email here and\n\n52\n00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:42.601\nif we put in a mobile account number.\n\n53\n00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:49.450\nLet's do this in the traditional form,\nit will look something like that.\n\n54\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.830\nCountry code not withstanding,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n55\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.000\nBut it will clearly be numerical,\nright not alpha.\n\n56\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.030\nIn other words, we wouldn't expect\na phone number to be entering.\n\n57\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.530\nOr to have digits associated with it,\n\n58\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.150\nwe would expected digits to have\nbeen numeric but not alpha digits.\n\n59\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.715\nAnd so if I did something like this,\nright, that would be seen\n\n60\n00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:11.913\nas being an incorrect or should be\nseen as being an incorrect parameter.\n\n61\n00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:16.255\nThat we're passing through the form in\norder to possess that information and\n\n62\n00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.613\nhave it show up accurately,\nwe have to validate the input.\n\n63\n00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:24.089\nAnd input validation is often the front\nend problem for improper error handling\n\n64\n00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.630\non the back end, in other words,\nwe have two things linked together here.\n\n65\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.940\nBecause if we don't input validate on the\nform, we're probably gonna get bad data.\n\n66\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.706\nAnd if we get bad data and\nthen we don't have an exception or\n\n67\n00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:38.195\nerror handling policy that\nidentifies that error.\n\n68\n00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:42.548\nAnd spits out an appropriate response\nthat error can tip over the system and\n\n69\n00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:44.484\ncause concern, maybe crash it,\n\n70\n00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:49.520\nsmash the stack stuff we talked about in\nthe last episode with buffer overflows.\n\n71\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.035\nOr could expose unnecessarily or\n\n72\n00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.816\nimproperly information\nthat should not be seen.\n\n73\n00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:59.885\nAnd what we look for in this kind of\nan attack, as simple as this sounds and\n\n74\n00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.699\nas simple as this looks like is.\n\n75\n00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.376\nAnd I'm gonna do this I'm gonna put\ninformation in there to fill in\n\n76\n00:04:05.376 --> 00:04:08.340\nthe password field hit submit,\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n77\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.230\nWhat we should get back, or\n\n78\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.850\nwhat we will get back is essentially just\na page that zeroes out some of the data.\n\n79\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.670\nAnd says, hey by the way,\nyou put something in incorrectly, or hey,\n\n80\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.490\nsorry about this.\n\n81\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.008\nBut you didn't seem to put in data\nin the form that we're expecting.\n\n82\n00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:21.420\nCan you try again, right?\n\n83\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.170\nIn other words improper input or,\nif we put an email address in, and\n\n84\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.530\na password that doesn't match.\n\n85\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.740\nHey, those credentials\ndon't seem to line up.\n\n86\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.240\nCan you go ahead and resubmit something\nlike that would occur normally,\n\n87\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.520\nit's what we would expect.\n\n88\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.950\nWhat we don't wanna see is an un-handled\nexception or improper error handling.\n\n89\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.510\nWhere we get back the internal\ncode from the database,\n\n90\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.430\ncommunication between the web server,\nand the back-end database.\n\n91\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.640\nWhatever Amazon's running on the back-end.\n\n92\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.234\nAnd if you've seen one of those pages\nit looks not like the sign in page.\n\n93\n00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:51.198\nBut rather a database page\nthat's got a lot of yellow code,\n\n94\n00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:54.550\nbars typically up at the top with\na bunch of red angry text on it.\n\n95\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.535\nSomething like slash SQL\nerror whatever and then.\n\n96\n00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:59.305\nYou're gonna see a bunch of raw code and\n\n97\n00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:01.881\nin the code you're gonna see\nthings like account calls,\n\n98\n00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:05.975\nyou're gonna see potentially directory\npaths, you're going to see port numbers.\n\n99\n00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:09.615\nIP addresses, you're gonna see raw\ndata that's being passed back and\n\n100\n00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:12.045\nforth to explain what's going on.\n\n101\n00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.535\nBut we're not suppose to show you that.\n\n102\n00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:16.975\nThat is the output of a process\nthat the developer or\n\n103\n00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:19.230\nthe data base administrator or both.\n\n104\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.950\nEssentially messed up and screwed up\non because they did not anticipate this\n\n105\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.850\ninput, this error this way.\n\n106\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.001\nAnd write some sort of error code or\nhave a process that would run or\n\n107\n00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.113\nstored procedure that would\nexecute that would deal with this.\n\n108\n00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:38.510\nAnd as a result put out some sort of\nacceptable, what are we talking about?\n\n109\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.940\nSanitizing the data, right?\n\n110\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.070\nSo in other words,\nno data would be exposed, right?\n\n111\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.400\nSo this is what we expect and\nwhat we wanna see when we validate this.\n\n112\n00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.620\nCan we go back to our sheet here, please?\n\n113\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.200\nSo if I put something in like this and\nI put in our password,\n\n114\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.440\nwhatever it is,\nI should get back something like this.\n\n115\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.450\nThere was a problem, we cannot find\nan account with that email address, right,\n\n116\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.060\nand /or mobile number,\nright, okay, no problem.\n\n117\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.690\nLet's put an e-mail address\n12something@ whatever the case may be.\n\n118\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.610\nIt doesn't matter, totally made up.\n\n119\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.350\nAgain, some sort of password,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n120\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.900\nAgain, try to sign in.\n\n121\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.810\nRight, and it tells me hey,\nwe're not finding an account.\n\n122\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.560\nThat's a properly handled error,\n\n123\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.800\nthat's an exception,\nthat has been anticipated, right?\n\n124\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.480\nAnd is being dealt with appropriately\nbecause the web-page returns\n\n125\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.750\nessentially this.\n\n126\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.500\nLeaves it intact, zeros out the password,\ngood and puts up a little bar.\n\n127\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.930\nYou know a little message area that says,\nby the way when this happens,\n\n128\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.780\nplease take this appropriate action.\n\n129\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.130\nIf I signed in with a legitimate account\nI would be able to get through and\n\n130\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.320\nget in with no trouble, right?\n\n131\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.380\nSo we wanna see this when we test.\n\n132\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.080\nWhat we don't wanna see is\nthe unhandled exception.\n\n133\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.800\nSo keep in mind that improper handling is\na significant liability for us on the web.\n\n134\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.210\nSomething that you just wanna\nmake sure you're aware of.\n\n135\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.580\nWe could see data based dumps,\nstack traces, error codes,\n\n136\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.640\nall sorts of stuff that is important\nto the app, important to the developer.\n\n137\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.330\nBut not something that should be shown to\nsomebody whose attempting to get up to no\n\n138\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.060\ngood, certainly.\n\n139\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.608\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n140\n00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:14.500\nBroken account management this is\nwhere we are able to go in and\n\n141\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.750\nhave account functions and management\nfeatures like account updates, recovery or\n\n142\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.460\nforgotten, or lost passwords.\n\n143\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.460\nResetting the password.\n\n144\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.050\nIf we go back to our page here for\n\n145\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.210\na minute, what you'll see\ndown towards the bottom here.\n\n146\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.970\nRight there, is hey, I forgot my password.\n\n147\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.230\nOkay, no big deal, let's go over there.\n\n148\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.350\nLet's enter a valid email address,\nwhatever it is.\n\n149\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.900\nAnd, if you're on file,\nwe'll send you your password, no problem.\n\n150\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.080\nSo, again, we should have that capability.\n\n151\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.407\nWhat we should not do is put\nthe password up on the screen, right?\n\n152\n00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:47.134\nWe don't want that happen again, what we\nshould not do is validate in any way shape\n\n153\n00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:51.381\nor form that you have any access to any\nof that data until you've reset it or\n\n154\n00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:53.668\nyou have a mechanism to let you do that.\n\n155\n00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:55.696\nIf that's not working in the right way,\n\n156\n00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:59.587\nthen we've somehow created an error\nsituation where We may be able to get in.\n\n157\n00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:03.614\nWe may be able to reset the system without\nhaving to go through the legitimate or\n\n158\n00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:05.490\nauthorized account to do so.\n\n159\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.610\nThat would be bad and that would be\nan example of broken account management.\n\n160\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.770\nSo we have to look for\nthis kind of stuff and validate this.\n\n161\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.760\nRemember, a lot of these kinds of things\nare gonna be dealt with through typically\n\n162\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.460\nvulnerability assessments,\nthrough pen testing, penetration testing,\n\n163\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.840\npen for short.\n\n164\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.820\nWe don't have a pencil testing\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We know.\n\n165\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.935\n[CROSSTALK] That's right.\n&gt;&gt; We need a pen test.\n\n166\n00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:26.488\nBut the pencil lobby was obviously clearly\nnot really on top of their game that day,\n\n167\n00:08:26.488 --> 00:08:29.110\nbecause when they said,\nwhat are we going to call this.\n\n168\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.399\nWell, the pen lobby's been really\nbothering us to get in there.\n\n169\n00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.387\nThey obviously, the pencil lobby,\nthey just didn't show up.\n\n170\n00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:37.739\n&gt;&gt; Well, they were still busy using\nall snail mail to communicate.\n\n171\n00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:38.740\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's what it was.\n\n172\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.673\n&gt;&gt; It just took too long.\n\n173\n00:08:39.673 --> 00:08:42.720\n&gt;&gt; And just the pen lobby was there\nwith the new fangled technology, right?\n\n174\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.382\nAnd just therefore they got it.\n\n175\n00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:44.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n176\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.850\nyou think about just the naming and\nhow so many things come about.\n\n177\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.650\nAnd I'm just babbling on so I'll actually\nget back to what we're talking about.\n\n178\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.820\nBut just a random funny aside, that is our\nnumber one for the episode by the way.\n\n179\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.140\nDirectory traversal what\ndo we have going on there?\n\n180\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.160\nThese are often referred\nto as dot-dot-dash attacks,\n\n181\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.290\nyou may have heard them.\n\n182\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.471\nReferred to that way.\n\n183\n00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.737\nThis is where we, and sometimes called a\nwalking attack, where literally, you walk\n\n184\n00:09:08.737 --> 00:09:12.720\nthe hierarchy, or walk the file structure\nby being able to use the web browser.\n\n185\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.380\nRemember, everything we're talking about\nis being executed through a web browser,\n\n186\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.780\nor an application that is gonna\nbe able to consume web services.\n\n187\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.920\nNot every application that runs on\nthe web is always a web browser.\n\n188\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.240\nThere are many applications\nthat can run and\n\n189\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.070\ninteract within consume web services that\nare not first and foremost web browser.\n\n190\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.160\nBut many of them are, and that's where\nwe often officially see these attacks.\n\n191\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.600\nDo you ever do any directory traversal?\n\n192\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, all the time.\n\n193\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.240\n&gt;&gt; Kind of stuff you're doing right?\n\n194\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.420\n&gt;&gt; It's great stuff, because ultimately if\nI can do directory traversal, I'm probably\n\n195\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.920\nin line to do something like a remote file\ninclusion, or a local file inclusion.\n\n196\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.025\nAnd then we start getting into what you\nwere talking about before, with the logs.\n\n197\n00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:47.970\nKnowing where the logs are.\n\n198\n00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.320\nI can-\n&gt;&gt; You can erase those logs.\n\n199\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.223\n&gt;&gt; I can generate a log\n&gt;&gt; That has malicious code in it, and\n\n200\n00:09:53.223 --> 00:09:55.450\nthen use my directory traversal or\n\n201\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.312\nlocal file inclusion to use that\nlog file to give me access.\n\n202\n00:09:59.312 --> 00:10:01.181\n&gt;&gt; Yep, or to get somebody else to launch\nit at some point when they're viewing it,\n\n203\n00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:01.821\nor however you wanna do it.\n\n204\n00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:04.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.490\n&gt;&gt; Or, they may, and this is even\na more dastardly right thought process.\n\n206\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.273\nYou may actually then if you know that\nyou're targeting a web server but\n\n207\n00:10:13.273 --> 00:10:17.699\nyou know there's a SAM or Syslock system\ninvolved you could in theory set that log.\n\n208\n00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:19.959\nThat log would be sucked out, aggregated\nup to the master kind of hive system which\n\n209\n00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:21.849\nif it has certain kinds of malware\nwould then be exploited and used.\n\n210\n00:10:21.849 --> 00:10:26.686\n&gt;&gt; And could literally not only\ninfect the the one machine but\n\n211\n00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:32.314\ncould get you into the same system\nwhere at that point you could erase\n\n212\n00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:35.620\nall evidence not just of what you did\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n213\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.050\nin a kind of attack that\ntakes place at will, right?\n\n214\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.020\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Because now you've ratted that main\n\n215\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.630\nsystem where all the logs are aggregated\nand all the alerting takes place.\n\n216\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.095\n&gt;&gt; Boy, it's a lot of fun.\n\n217\n00:10:45.095 --> 00:10:47.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is just from the minds of\n\n218\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.175\nthe imagineers at Disney comes\n&gt;&gt; I'm all sorts of great things, right?\n\n219\n00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:53.915\n&gt;&gt; So can you imagine if they\nhad like a system, right?\n\n220\n00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:55.115\nLike a whole\n\n221\n00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:56.865\nunderground force that nobody knows about\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.775\n&gt;&gt; that actually just goes out and\ndoes that kind of stuff?\n\n223\n00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:00.535\n&gt;&gt; At Disney?\n\n224\n00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just I mean\n&gt;&gt; That would be funny.\n\n225\n00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:03.365\n&gt;&gt; with the great skills these guys\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n226\n00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:04.360\n&gt;&gt; have to do all sorts of\n&gt;&gt; To great things.\n\n227\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.780\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n&gt;&gt; But imagine if they put that knowledge\n\n228\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.620\nto use for bad instead of good.\n\n229\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.710\n&gt;&gt; That would be a problem.\n\n230\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.350\nMost likely.\n\n231\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're likely anti-Disney, right?\n\n232\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of Mickey Mouse you'd have like\n\n233\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.530\nthe dark hat hacker.\n\n234\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.466\n&gt;&gt; Ricky Rat or something.\n\n235\n00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.\n\n236\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Right so directory traversal and\n\n237\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.580\nby the way just to be clear,\nwe're not suggesting Disney does that.\n\n238\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.660\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Just wanna make sure\n\n239\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.830\nthat that does not come off the wrong way.\n\n240\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.490\nSo directory traversal, right?\n\n241\n00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.900\nThis is an attack that allows us to turn\nthe web browser into a file explorer,\n\n242\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.940\nbecause that's essentially what it is,\n\n243\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.820\nit's just that we don't\noften use it that way.\n\n244\n00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.848\nHave you ever taken your web browser,\nand instead of typing in http whatever,\n\n245\n00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:42.082\nftp whatever, C:\\Windows\\System32.\n\n246\n00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:45.540\nDo that, you're gonna get a listing of\nwhatever is in the Windows directory\n\n247\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.860\non your local machine.\n\n248\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.990\nA web browser is just\na web-enabled file explorer\n\n249\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.700\nin other words is what I'm suggesting you.\n\n250\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.400\nAnd as a result of that,\nit is capable of allowing us to\n\n251\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.480\nwalk through a file hierarchy on a web\nserver just like we do on a local machine.\n\n252\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.481\nIf you know the hierarchy, right?\n\n253\n00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:06.760\nSo for the inetpub\\wwwroot whatever, and\n\n254\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.540\nthen you can then specify certain number\nof directories you would like to go down,\n\n255\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.940\nassuming you have\nthe right level of access.\n\n256\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.620\nYou literally can get that to show up\nright on the screen as if you are looking\n\n257\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.520\nat the files structure locally.\n\n258\n00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.700\nAnd then as Daniel suggested,\nlocal file inclusion, and things like that\n\n259\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.120\nare child's play at that point\nbecause you've already gotten access.\n\n260\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.180\nThe best way to prevent this by the way\ndo not directly browsing from on\n\n261\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.460\nunauthorized or unknown in point.\n\n262\n00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.567\nIn other words don't talk to strangers,\nright?\n\n263\n00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:34.940\nMama always said stranger danger.\n\n264\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n265\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.086\n&gt;&gt; And she wasn't kidding, right?\n\n266\n00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:41.159\nIf you talk to strangers you\nget yourself into trouble.\n\n267\n00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:45.780\nThe quickest and dirtiest and easiest\nway to stop this behaviour is to prevent\n\n268\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.490\nunauthorized, unvalidated,\nunknown directory access through browsing.\n\n269\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.290\nThis is a setting on most web browsers, or\nexcuse me not web browsers, setting on-\n\n270\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Servers.\n\n271\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.230\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n272\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:12:56.913 --> 00:12:57.416\n&gt;&gt; Look, I wanna-\n\n274\n00:12:57.416 --> 00:12:57.954\n&gt;&gt; Turning that on.\n\n275\n00:12:57.954 --> 00:13:00.465\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I meant web servers.\nI didn't mean web browsers.\n\n276\n00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:01.711\nYou're just taking things out of context,\n\n277\n00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:03.013\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:13:03.013 --> 00:13:05.067\n&gt;&gt; But on web servers, right?\n\n279\n00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:07.345\n&gt;&gt; This is typically a check box, right?\n\n280\n00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:09.042\nIf not a check box it's a parameter you\n\n281\n00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:12.502\nset in a config file or a combination\nof both depending on what you're doing.\n\n282\n00:13:12.502 --> 00:13:13.532\nBut by default it may or\n\n283\n00:13:13.532 --> 00:13:17.003\nmay not be allowed, a lot of times it's\nnot allowed but it may be depending on\n\n284\n00:13:17.003 --> 00:13:20.096\nthe version of the web server you're\nusing, how far back it goes and\n\n285\n00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:23.662\nwhat level of security you're applying.\nWe may apply templates or\n\n286\n00:13:23.662 --> 00:13:28.133\nlock down templates or tools to web\nbrowsers to further secure them and\n\n287\n00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:30.635\ndirect re-browsing from an allowed or\n\n288\n00:13:30.635 --> 00:13:34.742\nunrestricted access is usually cut off.\nBut somebody may go in there and\n\n289\n00:13:34.742 --> 00:13:38.320\nmess around with stuff and not realize it.\nThis is where letting developers\n\n290\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.010\nhave access to production web\nservers causes a tremendous problem.\n\n291\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.655\nBecause developers may not realize the\nissues associated with certain settings\n\n292\n00:13:45.655 --> 00:13:47.547\nthey're enabling to make their job easier.\n\n293\n00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:51.300\nNot suggesting that's not something that\nyou may need to do but you would do it in\n\n294\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.185\nnon-production environments until\nyou're ready to launch the code.\n\n295\n00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:56.265\nYou gotta remember to go back and\nfix that, right?\n\n296\n00:13:56.265 --> 00:14:00.505\nSo that kind of stuff gets you into a lot\nof trouble make sure you're aware of that.\n\n297\n00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:02.090\nAgain we would look for again and\n\n298\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.020\nDaniel was very kind to describe\nevidence of local file inclusions.\n\n299\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.280\nHey, it's weird that that file was\njust included there out of the blue.\n\n300\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.220\nAll the other files in that directory\nhave a timestamp of two months ago and\n\n301\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.290\nall of sudden we're seeing new activity\nwhere we don't normally expect to see.\n\n302\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.100\nThat may be a warning sign,\nthat something's happening.\n\n303\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.480\nWhere was that access coming from?\n\n304\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.700\nIf you have inbound logging on\nthe directory access you should see\n\n305\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:30.170\ninformation about protocol, port, IP,\nvalidation, things like that taking place.\n\n306\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.510\nIf you're not vetting those connections\nthen you have no clue who is coming in and\n\n307\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.170\nno clue who those people are,\nwhat they are doing.\n\n308\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.300\nAnd chance are good that somebody like\nDaniel, somebody like myself that is\n\n309\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.600\nprobably in there up to no good and\nthat can prove to be an issue.\n\n310\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.180\nWe talked about SQL Injection attacks\nalready and the issues associated there,\n\n311\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.290\nany kind of execution of malicious\nSQL code structured query language,\n\n312\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.530\nnot Microsoft SQL necessarily.\n\n313\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:58.330\nAlthough Microsoft certainly named their\nflagship database product after SQL.\n\n314\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.900\nBut MS SQL is how we hear that refered to\ntraditionally, generically SQL statements\n\n315\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.550\nof any kind that control a web\napps data base server or\n\n316\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.090\nservers on the backend is what\na SQL Injection can do to us.\n\n317\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.635\nWe wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n318\n00:15:10.635 --> 00:15:13.080\nWe've talked about parameter and\nforeign tampering already.\n\n319\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.210\nI showed you a little example of us here.\n\n320\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.690\nManipulating the parameters that exchange\nback and forth may lead to unhandled\n\n321\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.320\nexceptions, the exposure of information,\nand as a result of that may lead to then,\n\n322\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.510\nthe ability for us to go in and\nmodify application data.\n\n323\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.700\nWe may be able to get into the back\nend and do a variety of things.\n\n324\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.870\nWe may be able to go in and through a man\nin the middle attack, spoof a masquerade\n\n325\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.190\nattack where we gather credentials, or log\nin and modify configuration parameters.\n\n326\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.000\nWe can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n327\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.090\nThat could take place and\nagain this could be very problematic.\n\n328\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.905\nHow do we find evidence of\nthis as a investigator?\n\n329\n00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.254\nWe look at those log files, right?\n\n330\n00:15:48.254 --> 00:15:51.765\nThis is where logs become so critical and\nthis is why protecting that log\n\n331\n00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:55.746\ninfrastructure It's so important because\nif you're able to execute the attack\n\n332\n00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:58.964\nDaniel and I just explained to you and\nkind of stitched together,\n\n333\n00:15:58.964 --> 00:16:02.150\nin terms of the thought process\na couple of minutes ago, right?\n\n334\n00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.840\nWith the idea that we could potentially\nexecute a directory traversal attack.\n\n335\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.425\nDo local file inclusion, include exploit\ncode in one or more logs or other files.\n\n336\n00:16:11.425 --> 00:16:12.862\nIt doesn't have to be a log file but\n\n337\n00:16:12.862 --> 00:16:15.470\nlogs are just one of any kinda\nfile that would be there.\n\n338\n00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.830\nBut certainly a log file,\n\n339\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.940\nwhich as I suggested could then\nget vacuumed up into a SIM System.\n\n340\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.440\nAggregated through some sort\nof engine at the far side,\n\n341\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.755\nwhich if that exploit code goes off.\n\n342\n00:16:26.755 --> 00:16:29.889\nCould take over the SIM System\ngiving us complete control,\n\n343\n00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:33.870\nin theory if it's done the right way\nover the logging infrastructure.\n\n344\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.820\nNot just on one machine but\nliterally for the entire enterprise.\n\n345\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.710\nI mean imagine the evil laugh, right,\n\n346\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.990\nthat would come out of the villan\nwhen that happened, right?\n\n347\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.230\nThat would be like a classical all time\nevil mou-ha-ha or whatever that would be.\n\n348\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.960\nSo that kind of stuff.\n\n349\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.192\nYou talk about the sweet spot for a tax,\nthat's the kinda thing we wanna do.\n\n350\n00:16:52.192 --> 00:16:55.440\nYou and I go after a box,\nif I'm doing penetration testing or\n\n351\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.140\nif I'm doing vulnerability assessments for\n\n352\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.640\ncustomers, I'm not interested\nin just hacking one box.\n\n353\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.710\nThat's child play.\n\n354\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.120\nAnybody can break into a box if they try\nhard enough, and look long enough, and\n\n355\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.320\nthere are enough boxes around.\n\n356\n00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.590\nAnd in most enterprise networks there's at\nleast one or more boxes that are always\n\n357\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.040\nvulnerable despite your best\nefforts to defend, right?\n\n358\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.340\nSo if I look long and hard, I'm gonna find\none or more boxes that I can get into.\n\n359\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.110\nThat's just the law of averages.\n\n360\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.740\nThat's all that is.\n\n361\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.060\nI'm suggesting that while that is\nimportant, it is not the end game for\n\n362\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.030\na skilled attacker.\n\n363\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.590\nIt is simply the beginning,\nright, as opposed to the end.\n\n364\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.610\nRemember in The Mummy,\nright, the original Mummy?\n\n365\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.920\nThey're remaking it now of course,\nbut the original Mummy, right?\n\n366\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Death is just the beginning, right?\n\n367\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.229\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n368\n00:17:31.229 --> 00:17:33.829\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea that\nwe're thinking about here,\n\n369\n00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:36.240\nthat it's not about that one machine.\n\n370\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.100\nI will use a variety of techniques against\nvariety machines until I find a door\n\n371\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.970\nthat I can easily get into\nbecause you've left in unguarded.\n\n372\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.460\nBut I don't really care about that box and\n\n373\n00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.580\nthat door it's a throwaway box for\nme, right?\n\n374\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.920\nAll I wanna is a way in.\n\n375\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.930\nWhat I then have to do is establish\na b chain as we discussed and\n\n376\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.680\nstart recounting.\n\n377\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.750\nI've got to look for the vulnerable pieces\nof real estate or the valuable items that\n\n378\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.300\nI wanna go in the case of a pentest or\nvulnerabilities assessment,\n\n379\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.180\neither assess or plant a flag on top of,\nto prove that I was there, all right?\n\n380\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.460\nThat's the end game in\nthose kind of assessments.\n\n381\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.530\nBlue team, read team exercises,\nand whatever the case may be.\n\n382\n00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.050\nPurple team exercises, which is\nkinda the combination of these two\n\n383\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.380\nall done together in one today,\nif you've heard that term or not.\n\n384\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.523\nBut however we get there, when attackers\nand doing this for real, they may or\n\n385\n00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:22.582\nmay not be interested in that one box.\n\n386\n00:18:22.582 --> 00:18:26.205\nBut they may have a broader agenda and if\nthey're smart, they're gonna come in and\n\n387\n00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.830\nthey're gonna quietly observe.\n\n388\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.630\nAnd they're gonna watch and\nthey're gonna wait.\n\n389\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.320\nAnd I talk about this lot in another\nshows, but the one thing that attackers\n\n390\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.690\nmust have and have in abundance if\nthey're smart is patience and time.\n\n391\n00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.590\nRight, because they're being paid or\nthey're on contract or loan or looking\n\n392\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.440\nto generate revenue, based on their\nability to gain valuable information or\n\n393\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.920\nachieve an end result somebody\nelse is going to pay for.\n\n394\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.110\nAnd if they're smart,\nif they're patient and\n\n395\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.650\nthey just are methodical, they will more\noften than not be able to be successful,\n\n396\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.728\nbecause we can't be all\nplaces at all times.\n\n397\n00:18:56.728 --> 00:19:00.575\nWe've establish jobs very difficult to do,\nunless we're talking about a highly\n\n398\n00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:03.541\nsecured enclave,\nwith a very specific defensive perimeter.\n\n399\n00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:08.311\nAnd very specific monitoring, that is\ndesigned to stop inbound traffic in\n\n400\n00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:13.400\ncertain ways that only allows very\nspecific authorized traffic to take place.\n\n401\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.560\nSo we do have these networks.\n\n402\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.890\nThey exist all over the place.\n\n403\n00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.150\nBut average production networks\nare not designed that way.\n\n404\n00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.200\nThey're designed to be noisy and loud and\n\n405\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.450\nfull of holes cuz that's the way things\nget done within business, right?\n\n406\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.420\nIt's easy to get things in and out.\n\n407\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.290\nWe're not worried about security,\nwe're worried about productivity.\n\n408\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.310\nThat's one of the generic challenges\nwe have in the corporate world today.\n\n409\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.650\nWhen we start worrying about\nsecurity more than productivity,\n\n410\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.599\nit will be a very different\nset of conversations, but\n\n411\n00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:36.530\nit's gonna cost a lot of time and\nmoney to get there.\n\n412\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.299\nAnd as a result we don't often\nsee that is being valuable.\n\n413\n00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:43.880\nThat's just the way we run our world,\nand this is the way we're kinda wired.\n\n414\n00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.260\nSo as a result,\nflat opportunity out there.\n\n415\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.940\nWhat we're looking for,\nin other words, is we may\n\n416\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.970\nbe able to track back as investigators\nto the door that was kicked in.\n\n417\n00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.950\nThat would be great.\n\n418\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.130\nWe need to do that.\n\n419\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.890\nBut if the attacker's smart their gonna\n\n420\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.650\neither create a bunch of fake\ndoors throw us off the trail.\n\n421\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.564\nThey'll scatter malware in a bunch of\nplaces, make it difficult for us for\n\n422\n00:20:04.564 --> 00:20:06.243\nus to know exactly which machine was used.\n\n423\n00:20:06.243 --> 00:20:10.246\nAnd or they're going to cover their\ntracks, like Dan was suggesting,\n\n424\n00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:14.290\nmaybe destroy log files,\ncreate new ones, modify existing ones.\n\n425\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.565\nThe list is just on and on and on.\n\n426\n00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:19.645\nAnd because of that, it may be very\nhard for us to find that door and\n\n427\n00:20:19.645 --> 00:20:23.370\nthen understand how to go through it and\nultimately to our advantage.\n\n428\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:28.060\nA game that understanding as\nan attacker and or as a defender,\n\n429\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.650\nas an investigator, take your pick.\n\n430\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.880\nSo we gotta understand the logic\nof those things, right?\n\n431\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.314\nI was servicely mentioned making the\nresources of a single machine unavailable\n\n432\n00:20:36.314 --> 00:20:37.911\nthrough a one on one attack.\n\n433\n00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:42.300\nI attack the web server, if I take it down\nthat's a DoS, a denial of service attack.\n\n434\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.710\nThe DDOS,\nDistributed Denial Of Service attack.\n\n435\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.610\nMyself and a bunch of my friends are gonna\nattack the web server from various points\n\n436\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.940\non the compass, ten, 100, a 1,000,\n10,000 machines, whatever the case may be.\n\n437\n00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.785\nAnd if I'm successful and\nlaunching that overwhelming tidal wave\n\n438\n00:20:57.785 --> 00:21:00.915\nof attack against one system,\nthen it's a distributed denial of service.\n\n439\n00:21:00.915 --> 00:21:03.405\nSo botnets are used for\nthis, right, or zombies.\n\n440\n00:21:03.405 --> 00:21:04.945\nYou hear them referred\nto different ways today.\n\n441\n00:21:04.945 --> 00:21:08.440\n&gt;&gt; Ellen DeGeneres actually did\na distributed denial of service attack\n\n442\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Unintentionally,\n\n443\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.020\nagainst Instagram I believe it was.\n\n444\n00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.537\nYes, Instagram.\n\n445\n00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:13.195\n&gt;&gt; Instagram.\n\n446\n00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:18.119\n&gt;&gt; She was hosting the Oscars and took\na selfie with a bunch of stars behind her\n\n447\n00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:21.107\nand posted it on Instagram-\n&gt;&gt; A selfie right, yes.\n\n448\n00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:25.070\n&gt;&gt; And it just slammed them and\nyeah, brought down Instagram.\n\n449\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.160\nGood for her, good for her, good for\nher we like Instagram we're not saying\n\n450\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.090\nthat in an a negative way just good for\nher, right?\n\n451\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.020\nThat's important, we need celebrity\nbacking the kind of conversation and\n\n452\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.940\nexecuting on our behalf,\n\n453\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.690\nbecause this is what raises social\nconsciousness and awareness.\n\n454\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.640\nAbout security,\n\n455\n00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.330\nwe have Ellen DeGeneres DDoSing a major\ninformation provider in the social world.\n\n456\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.282\n&gt;&gt; She was fantastic for them.\n\n457\n00:21:45.282 --> 00:21:46.381\nShe was helping them out.\n\n458\n00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:49.456\n&gt;&gt; Then that's a good thing.\nLet's get Oprah signed up for that.\n\n459\n00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:50.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n460\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.460\nYou get Oprah you're golden.\n\n461\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.462\n&gt;&gt; Oprah is gonna help us\ntest your system for DDoSes.\n\n462\n00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:56.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\n\n463\n00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.200\na new opportunity for her, right?\n\n464\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If things don't go well down at\n\n465\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.780\nOprah Winfrey network.\n\n466\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.920\n&gt;&gt; You never know.\n&gt;&gt; She could go into security.\n\n467\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.330\n&gt;&gt; It could go under any day now.\n\n468\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.730\nIf you're out there Oprah and\nyou're listening,\n\n469\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.510\n&gt;&gt; Join our crew.\n\n470\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.520\n&gt;&gt; And you wanna explore a new\nopportunity, be in touch with Dave.\n\n471\n00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.528\n&gt;&gt; Glad to have you.\n\n472\n00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.878\n&gt;&gt; Let him know.\nSo, log tampering we've been talking\n\n473\n00:22:11.878 --> 00:22:12.920\nabout that.\n\n474\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.310\nExplained that that could be problematic.\n\n475\n00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.180\nWe talked about unvalidated input.\n\n476\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.230\nYou know this idea of validating\nas I showed you on the web page,\n\n477\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.240\nthe stuff that's coming in.\n\n478\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.135\nRemember a lot of times, we may have and a\ngood example let me go back to the screen\n\n479\n00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:28.589\nhere for a minute let me just show\nyou something while we're talking.\n\n480\n00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:31.350\nSo I'm just gonna go over here\nI'm gonna click the customer\n\n481\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.450\nservice link contact and\njust show us a different page here.\n\n482\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.472\nRight, so it's a selecting issue,\nmake a selection, whatever.\n\n483\n00:22:38.472 --> 00:22:42.661\nAnd then did you know, there's a phone\nnumber would you like to contact us,\n\n484\n00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:45.030\nyeah contact us via email, right, okay.\n\n485\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.669\nSo click there,\nyou get a little form right?\n\n486\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.530\nYour Amazon email address from your issue,\netc.\n\n487\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.850\nRight, for something like\nthis down here for instance,\n\n488\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.190\nin this I love this just generic\ntext boxes I could put stuff into.\n\n489\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.620\nI don't know how much text can go in\nthere, though it should be An upper limit,\n\n490\n00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.420\na certain number of characters\nbecause although we wanna give people\n\n491\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.440\nthe opportunity to type out\na description of their problem.\n\n492\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.450\nhey I'm not able to log in, when I try\nthis from my mobile phone, the site does\n\n493\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.300\ndisplay the right way, whatever your\nproblem is you're gonna write it in there.\n\n494\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.550\nI don't know 1,000 characters 10,000\n\n495\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.140\ncharacters I don't know what it is,\nsomething.\n\n496\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.660\nThere should be an upper limit.\n\n497\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.820\nAnd a lot of times there will be.\n\n498\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.400\nBut if somebody's careless\nin terms of their coding,\n\n499\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.990\nthey may not put an upper\nlimit on that thing.\n\n500\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:31.130\nWhich in theory means, I could dump\na terabyte of data into that form space.\n\n501\n00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.100\nHit submit and that data would go hurdling\ndown the pipe towards that web server.\n\n502\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.960\nAnd through that web server, because the\nweb server itself doesn't do anything with\n\n503\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.300\nthat data, it simply says,\nlook a bunch of stuff I don't understand.\n\n504\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.486\nLet me throw that over to the database cuz\nthat's where it's supposed to go, right?\n\n505\n00:23:45.486 --> 00:23:47.787\nAnd it's gonna go there to be processed or\n\n506\n00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:51.352\nwhatever the internal application\nlogic of the web form may be.\n\n507\n00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:53.699\nUsually it winds up Barreling\ndown towards one or\n\n508\n00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:56.112\nmore databases through\nthe business logic tier.\n\n509\n00:23:56.112 --> 00:24:00.974\nIf that happens, and I have not put,\nessentially, a governor, a stop on that\n\n510\n00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:05.467\nform, I may be able to overwhelm\nthe system simply by DOSing the system,\n\n511\n00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:09.597\nby submitting the tremendously\nridiculously large ridonculus,\n\n512\n00:24:09.597 --> 00:24:11.328\nI believe is what you said.\n\n513\n00:24:11.328 --> 00:24:12.820\n&gt;&gt; Ridonculus, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Ridonculusly large amount of data.\n\n514\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a technical term.\n\n515\n00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:14.587\n&gt;&gt; A highly technical term.\n\n516\n00:24:14.587 --> 00:24:15.572\nIt's like the googolplex.\n\n517\n00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:17.332\n&gt;&gt; It'll be on the exam, right?\n\n518\n00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:21.650\n&gt;&gt; And so, just keep in mind that that\nis one example of unvalidated input or\n\n519\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.440\ninput validation.\n\n520\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.980\nNow another one.\n\n521\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.170\nUp here for email.\n\n522\n00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.721\nEmail addresses, traditionally, are alpha\nnumeric in their format, meaning,\n\n523\n00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:33.350\nthat they'll use letters and numbers.\n\n524\n00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.320\nBut we don't use certain special\ncharacters because certain\n\n525\n00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.140\ncharacters are not acceptable for email.\n\n526\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.540\nFor instance,\nyou may have an underscore but\n\n527\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.610\nyou won't have a space in\nthe email address, traditionally.\n\n528\n00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.670\nSo as a result, if, again, we're not\ninput validated, I may submit an email\n\n529\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.660\naddress that has incorrect characters\nin it, perhaps SQL injection code.\n\n530\n00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.240\nBecause I could write a small\nSQL injection query string,\n\n531\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.230\nmaybe 100 characters or something,\ndoesn't have to be very long,\n\n532\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.610\nto get me just a hook in the system and a\nfoot in the door to open it up enough that\n\n533\n00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.030\nI can then just get access, and I can\nstart throwing a lot more stuff at it.\n\n534\n00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.430\nBut that initial touch doesn't\nhave to require a lot of code.\n\n535\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.660\nI could do that in under 100 characters,\nit doesn't have to be very long.\n\n536\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.700\nIt can probably be 20 characters,\nnot even,\n\n537\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.700\nmaybe even less than what we're doing.\n\n538\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.405\n&gt;&gt; Look up the Google search\nLittle Bobby Tables, and\n\n539\n00:25:20.405 --> 00:25:21.870\nthat'll be a fun little comic to read.\n\n540\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.860\nIt's a little web comic, super funny,\nand basically speaks to what's happening\n\n541\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.170\nhere is somebody named their kid-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n542\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.190\n&gt;&gt; A SQL injection attack which\ndropped all the databases.\n\n543\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.760\n&gt;&gt; In the school database.\n\n544\n00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.700\n&gt;&gt; In the school databases.\n\n545\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.030\nRight, so when they entered into\nthe school database, altered it, and\n\n546\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.400\nhe said, hey, you should sanitize your\ninput and you won't have that problem.\n\n547\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.250\nSo you don't have to worry about it.\n\n548\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.640\nLittle Bobby Tables, funny stuff.\n\n549\n00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you know that kind\nof stuff can happen, literally.\n\n550\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.510\nAnd again, it's not just, hey,\nlet's not accept special characters.\n\n551\n00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.420\nWhat about the character\nlength from the email?\n\n552\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.320\nAgain, should an email be\na 1,000 characters long?\n\n553\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.850\nAn email address is not that long.\n\n554\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.610\nEven the longest email addresses are\nprobably under a 100 characters in length.\n\n555\n00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:02.250\nSo limit that field to 100 characters,\nbecause if you don't, somebody's\n\n556\n00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.404\ngonna dump 25 lines of SQL exploit\ncode in there trying to submit it and\n\n557\n00:26:06.404 --> 00:26:08.442\nsee if they could push it through.\n\n558\n00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:11.880\nI promise you this is what's done\nbecause this is how we stress test,\n\n559\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.370\nhow we load test, and also,\nhow we fuzz test web applications.\n\n560\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.460\nThis is what we're doing on the backend\nto see if we can break them.\n\n561\n00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.020\nThis is also what hackers are doing\non the front end to see if they\n\n562\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.270\ncan kick the door in.\n\n563\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.300\nWhen I have to go back and forensically\nexamine and unwind something like this,\n\n564\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.900\nI have go to the web interface and\n\n565\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.140\nI got to start doing all this stuff trying\nto figure out what they did to get in.\n\n566\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.760\nAnd the more we know ahead of time and\n\n567\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.290\nthe more we eliminate,\nthe easier our jobs become.\n\n568\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.670\nSo this is the kind of stuff\nyou gotta think about, right?\n\n569\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.240\nSo we've talked about a lot\nof these kinds of attacks.\n\n570\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.970\nWe've added a bunch to the list as well.\n\n571\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.200\nTalked about injection flaws, talked\nabout things like broken access control,\n\n572\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.290\nI'm just looking at my list.\n\n573\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.490\nWhat about platform specific exploits?\n\n574\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.960\nYeah, this will be the idea\nof maybe there is a known\n\n575\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.040\nvulnerability in the Exam server\nversion 5.2, whatever it is.\n\n576\n00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.740\nMaybe there's one in Apache\nversion 2.5.2 build 3, and\n\n577\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.240\nif you're using that and you haven't\npatched it, then that exploit's there.\n\n578\n00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.491\nIn other words, this is just\nplain old fashioned security 101.\n\n579\n00:27:12.491 --> 00:27:16.100\nFirst day on the job,\nfirst thing we'd be in India,\n\n580\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.045\nmake sure you keep up to date\nwith your vendor patches.\n\n581\n00:27:18.045 --> 00:27:21.490\nDon't put systems in production\nthat have known vulnerabilities\n\n582\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.750\nthat are not addressed.\n\n583\n00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.310\nSo what if we have platform specific\nexploits that are available\n\n584\n00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.310\ncuz there are vulnerabilities?\n\n585\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.580\nWe gotta be aware of that and\nbe thinking about that as well.\n\n586\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.600\nThat's something that we would\nhave to be concerned about, so\n\n587\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.090\nthis could get us in trouble.\n\n588\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.820\nNow, are we gonna know\nabout all those exploits?\n\n589\n00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.420\nProbably not, that's why we have this\ncategory called zero-day exploits\n\n590\n00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.260\nthat just we're not aware of but\nthat occur and\n\n591\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.770\ncan get us in trouble cuz the vendor\ndoesn't even know about them.\n\n592\n00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:45.760\nSomebody figures it out.\n\n593\n00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.705\nWe've seen ample evidence that this in\nthe last several years if you look back at\n\n594\n00:27:49.705 --> 00:27:53.395\nthings like ShellShock, Poodle, and\nall these different attacks, and they've\n\n595\n00:27:53.395 --> 00:27:56.915\nattacked web based infrastructure as\nthe cell vulnerabilities, stuff like that.\n\n596\n00:27:56.915 --> 00:28:00.750\nForget about all the other stuff\nthat exists by vendors, generically.\n\n597\n00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.730\nShellShock and Poodle, and some of these,\nwere out there for decades.\n\n598\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.116\nNobody paid attention to them,\nbecause we knew about them.\n\n599\n00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:10.913\nIn theory, they had been identified, but\nnobody thought that they were significant,\n\n600\n00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:14.558\nand therefore, really paid attention to\nstopping them until somebody went back and\n\n601\n00:28:14.558 --> 00:28:15.069\nsaid, hm,\n\n602\n00:28:15.069 --> 00:28:18.646\nthere's probably something I could figure\nout if I read that old documentation.\n\n603\n00:28:18.646 --> 00:28:23.476\nI had nothing going on, it's been\na slow week in the hacking world, and\n\n604\n00:28:23.476 --> 00:28:24.640\nthere you go.\n\n605\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.320\nYou've got exploits that to this\nday are still causing us trouble.\n\n606\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.610\nSo this is the kinda thing that does\noccur and we have to be aware of as well.\n\n607\n00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.426\nWe do have more discussion points coming\nup, things like cross-site scripting,\n\n608\n00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:35.906\ncross-site request forgery.\n\n609\n00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:38.938\nHaven't forgotten about those,\njust skipping around a little bit just to\n\n610\n00:28:38.938 --> 00:28:41.838\nget a few small ones in as we're about\nto run out of time on this episode.\n\n611\n00:28:41.838 --> 00:28:43.716\nTee them up so we can come back and\ntalk about them.\n\n612\n00:28:43.716 --> 00:28:48.238\nWhen we do come back,\ninsufficient transport layer protections,\n\n613\n00:28:48.238 --> 00:28:52.300\nthings like cryptographic storage,\nwe've talked about.\n\n614\n00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.440\nBut what about things like\nSSL TLS downgrades, right?\n\n615\n00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.200\nA lot of different stuff,\nsome of which you may be involved with.\n\n616\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.562\nDaniel's a sneaky guy, he goes off and\n\n617\n00:28:59.562 --> 00:29:01.221\ndoes stuff when nobody's around and\nlooking.\n\n618\n00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:04.714\nSo we do still have some more stuff\nto come back and talk about, but\n\n619\n00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:08.223\nI think we may be getting close to\nthe whistle blowing on this one.\n\n620\n00:29:08.223 --> 00:29:12.092\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we like to not anger the\nalmighty clock that sits across the room\n\n621\n00:29:12.092 --> 00:29:15.110\nfrom us and tells us when we're\nsupposed to stop these shows.\n\n622\n00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.750\nBut so we'll keep that at bay by\ngoing ahead and calling it a day for\n\n623\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.870\nthis episode.\n\n624\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.490\nWe will definitely be back with more for\n\n625\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.120\nthe web attacks that we\nhave to worry about.\n\n626\n00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.330\nFind out what they are, how they work,\nso that we can protect against them.\n\n627\n00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.470\nAdam, thanks so much so far.\n\n628\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.870\nLooking forward to seeing\nyou in the next one.\n\n629\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.220\nHopefully, you guys will join us there.\n\n630\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.070\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n631\n00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.040\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n632\n00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.623\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n633\n00:29:40.623 --> 00:29:44.680\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n634\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.636\n[MUSIC]\n\n635\n00:29:47.636 --> 00:29:50.839\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:06.360\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.224\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:12.099\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.171\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:17.420\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.498\nToday's episode is all about,\nwell, CHFI version nine,\n\n9\n00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.510\nbecause that's what we've\nbeen slogging through.\n\n10\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.900\nHope you guys have been enjoying it so\nfar.\n\n11\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.940\nI know I sure have.\n\n12\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.810\nJoining us back in the studio for\nthose revelries, our good friend, Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.320\nAdam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.520\nAdam, glad to have you back, man.\n\n15\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.\n\n16\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.320\nAlways glad to be here.\n\n17\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.110\nGonna continue our conversations.\n\n18\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.020\nI believe we are stepping into\na multi-part series, as you know.\n\n19\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.170\nPart four of our continuing conversations\ntrying to investigating web attacks.\n\n20\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.270\nWalking through some of\nthe different concerns we have\n\n21\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.360\nfrom the attacker perspective, so\nwe're aware of them as investigators.\n\n22\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.870\nI've been going through that\nhit list of various attacks.\n\n23\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.245\nWanna continue that conversation.\n\n24\n00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.420\nCross-Site Scripting,\ncommonly referred to as XSS attacks.\n\n25\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.790\nI know you know a little bit about these.\n\n26\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.440\n&gt;&gt; Little bit.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you're familiar with them.\n\n27\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n28\n00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.875\n&gt;&gt; Tell me from your perspective when\nyou're doing maybe some pen testing work,\n\n29\n00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.830\nthings like that, how easy is it to\nexecute and set up a cross-site scripting?\n\n30\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.355\n&gt;&gt; It is ridiculously easy, and that's\nprobably why they're a favorite amongst\n\n31\n00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:15.510\npen testers and hackers alike,\nbecause all you have to do is\n\n32\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.290\nput in a little code into an input box and\nthen it uploads it to your form.\n\n33\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.390\nAnd then anybody that goes to\nthat site with that information\n\n34\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.920\nwill run that script.\n\n35\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.890\nA lot of times,\nI like to make that script day,\n\n36\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.170\nhey, check out my website\nwhich is dishing up.\n\n37\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.780\nOr maybe even gathering information,\nsomething like session IDs.\n\n38\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.510\nThose could be very, very handy.\n\n39\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.720\nAnd then I can steal your session ID,\nwhich will allow me to\n\n40\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.769\nlog into the website as yourself\nas long as that session is valid.\n\n41\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.590\nSo, [COUGH] let's do two things.\n\n42\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.967\nLet's just take a look\nat how easy it may be,\n\n43\n00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:52.177\nnot to set up a cross-site scripting\nattack, so, not gonna do that.\n\n44\n00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:53.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.280\n&gt;&gt; But I am gonna show you\n\n46\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.420\njust a logical data we suggested.\n\n47\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.300\nBut let's also then talk about another\nkind of attack, which you also maybe\n\n48\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.280\nInvolved with from your shady,\ndark past, from what I've heard.\n\n49\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.850\nThings like cross-site request forgeries.\n\n50\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.410\nYou may be familiar with those as well and\nI'm sure Daniel is,\n\n51\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.110\nand we'll chat about\nthose in just a moment.\n\n52\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.500\nBut, join me over here for just a second.\n\n53\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.950\nSo Daniel was suggesting,\njust to show you where we are.\n\n54\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.760\nWe're back on that Amazon page\nwe were looking at before.\n\n55\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.810\nDaniel was suggesting, hey, essentially\nwhat I do with a cross-site scripting\n\n56\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.680\nattack is I create some exploit code,\ncommonly a script of some kind, right?\n\n57\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.410\nAnd I'm gonna place that somewhere on the\nwebsite, the website that I want you to go\n\n58\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.120\nto and potentially interact\nwith instantly, right?\n\n59\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.110\nAnd if I can secret it there and get you\nto click on it, perhaps it will redirect\n\n60\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.575\nyou to or you'll click on a link\nthinking you're being redirected.\n\n61\n00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.450\nIt'll execute it,\nbeing the malware or the code.\n\n62\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.410\nAnd it will either take\nover the box directly, or\n\n63\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.940\nforce you to be re-directed to somewhere\nwhere that code will then execute and\n\n64\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.590\nallow you to be exploited through\na variety of different things.\n\n65\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.320\nSo, let's say that Daniel was able to,\nin theory, modify.\n\n66\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.790\nNot that this has ever happened,\nwant to be clear, full disclaimer here,\n\n67\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.055\nwe're not saying Amazon's website\nhas ever been hacked by Daniel or\n\n68\n00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:05.650\nanybody associated with ITProTV.\n\n69\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.110\nJust using this merely as an example,\nright?\n\n70\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.590\nBut to Daniel's point,\nwhat if Daniel had somehow created codes,\n\n71\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.320\nsort of script, and been able to get\nin to the Amazon site, and modify\n\n72\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.735\nthis form on this page where people would\ncome and have to submit a problem knowing,\n\n73\n00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:25.345\nhey, most people are gonna do that,\nthey'll click the send email button.\n\n74\n00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:27.905\nWhat if I modify that send\nemail button function and\n\n75\n00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:30.405\nsome code executes when\nI click that button?\n\n76\n00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:33.045\nWell, it could flow back into the browser.\n\n77\n00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:35.775\nWhat if, through a redirect,\nyou mentioned, hey, maybe one of\n\n78\n00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:39.845\nmy favorite ones is I'll redirect you\nthrough inviting you to click on a link to\n\n79\n00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:43.125\nwhat you think is a legitimate site but\nreally will take you off into space,\n\n80\n00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:47.610\nand In a black hole, and\nwe'll come and we'll take over?\n\n81\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.570\nSo what if we wanna, perhaps he says, hey,\nyou know what, I'll go and I'll modify?\n\n82\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.250\nAnd if he's smart, I'm not just\ngonna modify one of these links,\n\n83\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.660\nrandomly hoping people click.\n\n84\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.000\nI'm gonna modify every one of them.\n\n85\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.890\nSo no matter what they click on,\nthey're gonna be hit.\n\n86\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.760\nSo, he modifies these.\n\n87\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.330\nAnd when you click, you're not\nreally taking off to, I don't know,\n\n88\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.940\nwhatever that preview says,\nAmazon.com, GP, Redirect,\n\n89\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.000\nwhatever it is, but\nit'll go somewhere else, right?\n\n90\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200\nAnd so this could be evidence of\ncross-site scripting, where we're gonna\n\n91\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.130\ntrick someone into running that exploit\nscript or potentially set them up to be\n\n92\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.020\nvulnerable to be, then, taken over by code\nthat can run, but modifying the website or\n\n93\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.210\na web page where they would commonly go,\nand then execute in code in the browser.\n\n94\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.620\nThat allows us to take over.\n\n95\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.740\nRemember, this is a web based attack.\n\n96\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.560\nWe're talking about browsers.\n\n97\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.640\n&gt;&gt; And the scary thing is you\ndon't even have to have them,\n\n98\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.990\ntrick them into doing something.\n\n99\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.830\nAs long as they go to a site where you\nhave set up cross-sites scripting script-\n\n100\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.350\n&gt;&gt; It would run.\n\n101\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.190\n&gt;&gt; That would just run-\n&gt;&gt; Normally when they close-\n\n102\n00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.933\n&gt;&gt; As they go to the site, yeah.\n\n103\n00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.847\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] more than that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's that nefarious, but\n\n104\n00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:50.530\nalso that simple.\n\n105\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.660\nIf you look at cross-sites scripting,\nit's stupid easy to do.\n\n106\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.260\nAnd once it's done, well,\nyou basically got the whole castle.\n\n107\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.660\nYou may, obviously, depending on what your\nend game is, what you're looking to do.\n\n108\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.950\nBut I think the code itself-\n&gt;&gt; I think,\n\n109\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.140\nI specifically am targeting people,\nspecifically.\n\n110\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.290\nIf I know they visit a blog and\nthey're commenting on that blog,\n\n111\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.230\nI can put it in the comment section where,\nI can see these comments.\n\n112\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.240\nI know there's a cross-site\nscript running in those comments.\n\n113\n00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.250\nThey go to those comments to read them and\n\n114\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.790\nI hit the person I'm looking for,\nusually that's how I use it.\n\n115\n00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.820\nAs that the website\nmight not be my target,\n\n116\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.900\nthe person going to\nthe website is my target.\n\n117\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.820\n&gt;&gt; It's just a vehicle that allows\nyou to gain access to them.\n\n118\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.360\nAnd see, that's something you have to\nthink about, again, as an investigator.\n\n119\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.820\nBecause Daniel raises an excellent point,\nwhich is, a lot of times,\n\n120\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.330\nit may be a person that ultimately is\nthe endgame for this kind of an attack and\n\n121\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.380\nwe're simply using the website, or\nthe cloud that delivers the software,\n\n122\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.760\nor whatever the case may be,\nas the vehicle to reach that person,\n\n123\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.780\nthe tool that's being used\nto get access to them.\n\n124\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.120\nAnd so, we have to think about that.\n\n125\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.970\nWhat's unusual about that person?\n\n126\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.300\nAre they senior executive in a company?\n\n127\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.000\nIf so, maybe they were phished and\n\n128\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.185\nthey were targeted specifically because\nof their role and the position they hold.\n\n129\n00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:08.305\nAnd then, the exploit was designed to take\nadvantage of them because we know enough\n\n130\n00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:11.425\nabout their behavior and\ntheir patterns, as Daniel was saying.\n\n131\n00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:16.675\nSocial media is such a rich treasure trove\nof information from a social engineering\n\n132\n00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.135\nand a recognizance perspective for\nboth the bad actor and\n\n133\n00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:22.435\nthe investigator today, because again,\n\n134\n00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:26.660\npeople will comment on every aspect\nof what they do traditionally today.\n\n135\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.090\nI'm at this place having lunch.\n\n136\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.060\nWell, now I know he likes to go there or\nshe likes to go there.\n\n137\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.470\nMaybe I could, in theory,\n\n138\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.565\nif I wanted them bad enough, hack into\nthe wireless network in that restaurant.\n\n139\n00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:37.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe somebody then could be exploited\n\n140\n00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.022\nthrough that.\n\n141\n00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:41.290\nMaybe I'm checking in at such and\nsuch place.\n\n142\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.640\nOr maybe I comment, as Daniel suggested,\non this or that blog entry,\n\n143\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.310\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n144\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.530\nYou know, there are person that goes and\nreads the hacking for fun and profit blog.\n\n145\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.740\nWell, let me go and, obviously,\npresent some comments.\n\n146\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.620\nYou'll innocently look and\ngo, they are there.\n\n147\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.650\nAnd as we said, once that page loads,\nthat shell script, the cross-site\n\n148\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.690\nscript is gonna be loaded, and it\nessentially executes, and will be running.\n\n149\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.140\nAnd you're making a lot\nof collateral damage.\n\n150\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.500\nPeople will be found with that\nthat you may not wanted to target.\n\n151\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.760\nBut you will also, probably,\nif you cast a broad wide enough net,\n\n152\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.185\nprobably bring in or pull in the person\nyou're looking for as well, so\n\n153\n00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:17.665\nthat's definitely something to consider.\n\n154\n00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.535\nWe've talked about injection flaws,\n\n155\n00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:22.075\nyou're injecting malicious\ncode of variety of types.\n\n156\n00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.795\nSo remember,\nthey're not just limited to SQL,\n\n157\n00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:27.060\nalthough certainly SQL injections\nare the most common form\n\n158\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.560\nwe often hear talked about, but\nthere are many different ways to do this.\n\n159\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.980\nA cross-site request forgery\nis another kind of common one.\n\n160\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.400\nYou do any of these?\n\n161\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.080\n&gt;&gt; I haven't done a lot of these.\n\n162\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.390\nI'm aware of the concept basically-\n&gt;&gt; More of the cross-site variety, right?\n\n163\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, more so\n\n164\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.180\ncross site, but just trying to keep the-\n&gt;&gt; Or the XSS, we should say, both\n\n165\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.700\nthe cross-site, but not request forgeries,\nrather, just cross-site scripts, right?\n\n166\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta cut\n\n167\n00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.290\nshort, sorry-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n168\n00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.035\nJust this, getting the victim's\nbrowser to do the requesting for you.\n\n169\n00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in other words,\n\n170\n00:07:55.146 --> 00:07:58.930\nyou're trying to manipulate the browser\ninto making a forged http request, and\n\n171\n00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.378\nthen, as a result, the browser does\nall the heavy lifting and the work and\n\n172\n00:08:02.378 --> 00:08:05.959\nYou're able to take it over and/or\ndirect it and then take over the system.\n\n173\n00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.830\nYou’ll get things like your\ncredentials out of that.\n\n174\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.084\nSo you may be able to scrape someone's\ncredentials, user session replay or\n\n175\n00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:17.148\njust a spoof from masquerade after\nthe fact to get in, things like that.\n\n176\n00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:18.772\nSo really take you over the browser and\n\n177\n00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:21.564\nusing it as the tool to allow\nthe vulnerabilities to take place and\n\n178\n00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:23.465\nmanipulating it is what\nwe would see there.\n\n179\n00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:26.799\nWe've talked about broken access\ncontrol flaws related to this.\n\n180\n00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.542\nI've mentioned this already,\nplatform specific exploits.\n\n181\n00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.630\nWhat about insecure\ndirect object references?\n\n182\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.283\nThis is one that often flies under\nthe radar we don't think about very often.\n\n183\n00:08:35.283 --> 00:08:39.052\nBut there's a lot of code\nthat underlies web pages,\n\n184\n00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.800\nwe just don't stop to think about it.\n\n185\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.166\nBut if you've ever used\nthe developer tool set or\n\n186\n00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.878\nany of the web browsers in\nthe Internet Explorer tools,\n\n187\n00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:51.222\nit's usually Internet Explorer browsers\nrather it's usually F12 as a function key.\n\n188\n00:08:51.222 --> 00:08:54.188\nChrome has a way to turn it on\nthrough the advance settings.\n\n189\n00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:56.925\nFirefox does and\nSafari browsers, they all do.\n\n190\n00:08:56.925 --> 00:08:58.201\nIt's a matter of where you go.\n\n191\n00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.344\nYou can actually preview the code for\nweb page in the browser in real time.\n\n192\n00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:04.558\nUsually at the bottom,\nthere's a little window that opens up.\n\n193\n00:09:04.558 --> 00:09:05.613\nYou may have seen this.\n\n194\n00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:08.931\nAnd when you do this,\nyou're able to then see what is there.\n\n195\n00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:12.800\nNow, a lot of times there's nothing\nof value, it's a bunch of HTML,\n\n196\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.949\nmaybe some XML code, things like that\njust may or may not be of value to you.\n\n197\n00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:21.198\nBut if the developer has been careless,\nif they've embedded or\n\n198\n00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:26.312\nhardcoded either user accounts or\ndirectory paths or version information,\n\n199\n00:09:26.312 --> 00:09:31.048\nany little tidbit of information that\nmay be valuable to the attacker.\n\n200\n00:09:31.048 --> 00:09:32.348\nWe may be able to cull and\n\n201\n00:09:32.348 --> 00:09:35.606\ngain significant insight into\nthose things by doing this.\n\n202\n00:09:35.606 --> 00:09:39.803\nSo, one of the ways that we may gain\nan advantage is by looking the underlying\n\n203\n00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:40.861\ncode of websites.\n\n204\n00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:42.325\nWe may also mirror websites.\n\n205\n00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:45.181\nWe have tools that will\nsuck in entire websites and\n\n206\n00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:48.853\ncreate literally a photocopy of\nthem that we can host offline and\n\n207\n00:09:48.853 --> 00:09:52.334\njust hack away at to our pleasure,\nhowever long it takes us.\n\n208\n00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:54.310\nHTTP mirror and tools like this.\n\n209\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.320\nAgain, we examine these tools in the CEH\nshow, so if you wanna see some of that\n\n210\n00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.578\nkinda stuff and the hands-on hey how do\nI do it piece, that's a cross-reference\n\n211\n00:10:02.578 --> 00:10:06.123\ncross-walk set of knowledge for\nCEHFI as I've mentioned before.\n\n212\n00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:07.994\nThose two skills really go together, and\n\n213\n00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:10.886\nthey are two sides of the same\ncoin that make you more effective.\n\n214\n00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:15.033\nThe hacker wants to know more about\nthe forensic investigatory process, and\n\n215\n00:10:15.033 --> 00:10:17.665\nthe forensic investigator\nget on the Wiki blog.\n\n216\n00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n217\n00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:22.668\nthe forensic investigator wants to\nknow more about the hacking process.\n\n218\n00:10:22.668 --> 00:10:25.713\nSo you may wanna think about that,\nbut going in and\n\n219\n00:10:25.713 --> 00:10:30.443\nshowing how those tools work allow us\nto understand what we may find, right?\n\n220\n00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:33.105\nYou never know when we go fishing\nwhat we're gonna pull out.\n\n221\n00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:37.030\nWe may find evidence of,\nlike I said, something as simple and\n\n222\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.759\nseemingly innocuous as a directory path.\n\n223\n00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.784\nIf I see that it's a directory\npath of a certain type,\n\n224\n00:10:41.784 --> 00:10:43.817\nI immediately know what\nkinda web server is running.\n\n225\n00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:47.882\nI don't even need to do any GET HTTP\nheader attacks against the system,\n\n226\n00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:51.407\nlaunching malform GET requests\nto get back to host headers and\n\n227\n00:10:51.407 --> 00:10:54.616\nsee whether or not I'm yeah,\nI'm running IIS 8.5.\n\n228\n00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:58.010\nI could probably tell I'm running\nIIS just by looking at the directory\n\n229\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.227\npaths that are included in insecure direct\nobject references in the underlying code.\n\n230\n00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:04.335\nSo this is a really important concept.\n\n231\n00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:05.818\nAgain very simple to solve.\n\n232\n00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:08.094\nScrub the code,\nremove all direct references,\n\n233\n00:11:08.094 --> 00:11:11.592\nuse variables instead of direct\nreferences for those kinds of things, and\n\n234\n00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:15.667\ndeclare those variables in a separate file\nwhere they're not gonna be exposed right?\n\n235\n00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:17.628\nAnd that's traditionally what is done.\n\n236\n00:11:17.628 --> 00:11:19.602\nSo want to just be thinking about that.\n\n237\n00:11:19.602 --> 00:11:21.710\nInsufficient transport layer protection.\n\n238\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.450\nWe're not encrypting our traffic,\njust very simple, very plain,\n\n239\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.876\nvery easy to understand.\n\n240\n00:11:26.876 --> 00:11:31.587\nAn incredibly, incredibly simple problem\nto solve, unfortunately an incredibly\n\n241\n00:11:31.587 --> 00:11:34.933\npervasive problem-\n&gt;&gt; I find it interesting the fact that\n\n242\n00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:39.802\na lot of the problems come from the fact\nthat we're not just employing security\n\n243\n00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:42.188\ntechniques that are available to us.\n\n244\n00:11:42.188 --> 00:11:42.688\nWe're not-\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n245\n00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:44.193\n&gt;&gt; Working in a secure way, and\n\n246\n00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:47.519\nthat's why pen testers have jobs and\nand people have to come and\n\n247\n00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.693\ngo, well here's what you're doing.\n\n248\n00:11:49.693 --> 00:11:53.830\nYou're not implementing good security,\nyou're not using any type of encryption,\n\n249\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.507\nyou're not have a good backup strategy,\nyou don't have a good updating and\n\n250\n00:11:57.507 --> 00:11:58.554\npatching strategy.\n\n251\n00:11:58.554 --> 00:12:00.342\nAnd you're using old technology.\n\n252\n00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:01.592\nThere’s your problem right there.\n\n253\n00:12:01.592 --> 00:12:06.524\nIt's just a lot of this all boils down\nto us just not taking a harder security\n\n254\n00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:07.239\nposture.\n\n255\n00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:10.222\n&gt;&gt; We're just being,\njust silly and stupid.\n\n256\n00:12:10.222 --> 00:12:11.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it all boils down to.\n\n257\n00:12:11.284 --> 00:12:12.872\n&gt;&gt; It just amazes me.\n\n258\n00:12:12.872 --> 00:12:15.189\n&gt;&gt; We're just not exercising due care and\ndue diligence is what we would say.\n\n259\n00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:17.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.954\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to actually just show you.\n\n261\n00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:21.199\nI was talking about insecure\ndirect object references.\n\n262\n00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.127\nI said typically you hit F12 or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n263\n00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:27.951\nBut if you just wanna see what\nthe console looks like for\n\n264\n00:12:27.951 --> 00:12:30.290\nthe dev tools in IE for instance.\n\n265\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.890\nIn this case in Edge, all I did was\njust simply press, function key F12,\n\n266\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.417\nwhich is no small feat on\nthe Mac keyboard by the way.\n\n267\n00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:37.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; But I did that,\n\n268\n00:12:37.932 --> 00:12:39.339\nwhile Danny was just talking.\n\n269\n00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:42.563\nSo you know all I did was just\npull up the developer toolbar here\n\n270\n00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:46.976\nin the preview window I was talking about\non that same Amazon page we're looking at.\n\n271\n00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:50.745\nAnd you could see I've got a direct\nobject explorer, DOM explorer here.\n\n272\n00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:54.231\nI have a console debugger,\nI've got performance memory emulation,\n\n273\n00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:55.952\nall sorts of stuff I could look at.\n\n274\n00:12:55.952 --> 00:13:00.194\nAnd I'm looking at the actual\nunderlying code here, right,\n\n275\n00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:04.527\ndate AUI build date right there,\nAY build version for the GUI.\n\n276\n00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:09.063\nThis is stuff that tells me when this code\nwas put in play, when it was launched,\n\n277\n00:13:09.063 --> 00:13:10.565\nwhat version I'm using.\n\n278\n00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:12.229\nThat may or may not be important.\n\n279\n00:13:12.229 --> 00:13:15.670\nI’m not suggesting that's the magic\nkey that opens the door that lets you\n\n280\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.347\nhack Amazon.\n\n281\n00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:18.991\nBut I am suggesting that that\nkind of information may or\n\n282\n00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:22.677\nmay not be valuable to somebody,\ndepending on what they're looking to do.\n\n283\n00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:24.913\nAnd it's there for the taking on the web.\n\n284\n00:13:24.913 --> 00:13:27.711\nI haven't logged in to\na secure area of Amazon.\n\n285\n00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:30.719\nI'm not in as an account holder\nlooking at other information.\n\n286\n00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:34.332\nI'm just on the front end,\nsimply looking at this and\n\n287\n00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:38.988\nagain, I can see certain things may or\nmay not be helpful to me, but,\n\n288\n00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:42.146\nas I scroll down you can\nsee the kind of things.\n\n289\n00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:44.783\nI have a link reference\nthere to some images.\n\n290\n00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:48.661\nI have a script type that's telling me,\nyou know that I'm running on JavaScript.\n\n291\n00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.670\nSo it does tell me they're support Java.\n\n292\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.482\nThat's not necessarily earth shattering\ninformation, but it does, in my mind as\n\n293\n00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:57.967\nan attacker, start zeroing me in on\na group of exploits that I'm gonna start\n\n294\n00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:01.413\nwanting to think about that I may be\nable to launch against a site like this.\n\n295\n00:14:01.413 --> 00:14:03.198\nBecause if I know they're support Java,\n\n296\n00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:05.802\nthere's a class of exploits out\nthere that may be valuable.\n\n297\n00:14:05.802 --> 00:14:09.349\nI may go out and cross reference a tool\nlike Metasploit as a framework, or\n\n298\n00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.446\nMetasploitable, right,\nas a framework that would allow me.\n\n299\n00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:16.077\nIt's great when you start out as an\nunderground hacking tool and commercialize\n\n300\n00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:19.925\nyourself and become respectable, and you\nstart make gazillions of dollars selling\n\n301\n00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:23.576\nyour skills to people that are now gonna\nuse your tools both for good and for bad.\n\n302\n00:14:23.576 --> 00:14:25.502\nAnd good for\nthem if they are able to do that.\n\n303\n00:14:25.502 --> 00:14:29.442\nBut the dark dirty secret about\nMetasploitable is that for years it was\n\n304\n00:14:29.442 --> 00:14:33.920\nan underground hacking platform that\nEastern European hackers had created and\n\n305\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.816\nwere using to break into\neverything on the planet.\n\n306\n00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:39.772\nAnd then somehow, some way, somebody\nfigured out they could sell this thing and\n\n307\n00:14:39.772 --> 00:14:41.568\nmake money and\nit became somewhat respectable.\n\n308\n00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:44.776\nSo it's kind of interesting when you\ngo back and look at this stuff but,\n\n309\n00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:48.372\nall I'm suggesting is that, using this\nkind of tool set may or not be valuable.\n\n310\n00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:51.111\nBut again, as an investigator,\nI'm going to want to go look and\n\n311\n00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:52.349\nwalk through all that code.\n\n312\n00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:54.899\nIf I find direct object references\nthat should not be there,\n\n313\n00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.455\nI'm gonna want to note that, because that\nmay have been the way the attacker got in.\n\n314\n00:14:58.455 --> 00:15:00.824\nAnd I'm gonna wanna have knowledge of\nthat, so that's the kind of stuff that\n\n315\n00:15:00.824 --> 00:15:03.169\nwe're looking at right there as a matter\nof fact right, that kind of thing.\n\n316\n00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:05.856\nAgain, the equivalent of just\nabout any browser on the planet,\n\n317\n00:15:05.856 --> 00:15:07.466\nevery browser has a way of doing that.\n\n318\n00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:10.571\nBut it may be buried right,\nyou may have to go in five, six, seven,\n\n319\n00:15:10.571 --> 00:15:13.640\nlevels deep in the advanced setting\nto figure out how to turn it on.\n\n320\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.657\nBut it's there,\nyou just have to know how to find it.\n\n321\n00:15:15.657 --> 00:15:16.908\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n322\n00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:19.265\nI talked about SSL TLS downgrade attacks.\n\n323\n00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:22.510\nI mentioned them last episode, so hey,\nthis may be something to think about.\n\n324\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.910\nProtocol downgrades certain\nbrowsers are susceptible.\n\n325\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.886\nWe're using or should be moving towards\nthe use of TLS, Transport Layer Security,\n\n326\n00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:31.342\nmore and more on the web today,\n\n327\n00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:33.816\nmoving away from especially\nolder versions of SSL.\n\n328\n00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:36.038\nCertainly not version one or version two.\n\n329\n00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:40.743\nAnd so, if we're thinking about that, if\nwe could forced the browser back to using\n\n330\n00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:44.307\nearlier versions of the SSL protocol,\nthat may not be secure or\n\n331\n00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:46.009\nas secure as newer versions.\n\n332\n00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:47.861\nWe may be able to garner information and\n\n333\n00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.679\ngain access to things that\nnormally we would not be able to.\n\n334\n00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:54.630\nSo SSL or TLS downgrade attacks\nare really carried out in this way.\n\n335\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:59.166\nWe may be able to negotiate earlier\nlevels of cryptographic protection and\n\n336\n00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:03.990\nsupport that are more easily cracked in\nother words By using earlier versions of\n\n337\n00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.031\nSSL instead of TLS, which uses\nhigher level areas of protection.\n\n338\n00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:10.930\nAnd as a result may be harder for\nus to crack, so just be aware of that.\n\n339\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.707\nThings like for instance, the POODLE\nattack, I mentioned POODLE and I mentioned\n\n340\n00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:18.498\nShellShock and some others in the last\nepisode, Heartbleed, things like that.\n\n341\n00:16:18.498 --> 00:16:23.093\nPOODLE's an example of a SSL-TLS downgrade\nattack, or at least a vector for that.\n\n342\n00:16:23.093 --> 00:16:25.761\nIf you're not familiar with it,\njust do a little Google research on it,\n\n343\n00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:27.800\nit was pretty popular,\nbeen around for awhile.\n\n344\n00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.900\nCertainly was all the rage and all talked\nabout over the last couple of years, and\n\n345\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.090\nyou may hear and\nsee more about it yet coming up.\n\n346\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.275\nDepending on you know just\nwhether if it resurfaces.\n\n347\n00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:38.002\nWhat about failure to restrict URL access,\n\n348\n00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:40.230\nwe've talked about some\nof this already as well.\n\n349\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.379\nWe may be able to bypass web security\nsite, website security, I keep inverting.\n\n350\n00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what's going\n\n351\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.980\non with me today.\n\n352\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.391\nWeb security techniques, and\n\n353\n00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:51.870\nroad blocks that are put in the way to\nprevent people from getting around it.\n\n354\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.600\nWhat I mean is, we have a common\nfrontend to log in against.\n\n355\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.045\nLet's go back here, let me just get\nrid of the toolbar for a minute,\n\n356\n00:16:59.045 --> 00:17:00.381\nlet's just go back here.\n\n357\n00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:04.880\nNow, let's just go back to Amazon\n[COUGH] just a main landing page, right?\n\n358\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.996\nIf I'm on here, just again hypothetically,\nlet's say amazon.com.\n\n359\n00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:12.091\nAnd if I wanna log in, typically,\nI've gotta go to Log In or Accounts or\n\n360\n00:17:12.091 --> 00:17:13.498\nwhatever, and I gotta sign in.\n\n361\n00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:18.043\nWhat if there was a hidden Easter egg\nkinda page somewhere that will let me get\n\n362\n00:17:18.043 --> 00:17:22.307\ninto Amazon without having to go\nthrough the authentication regime and\n\n363\n00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:27.230\njust drops me directly into the, I don't\nknow, order history bin for any user?\n\n364\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.504\nAnd there is not, by the way, I wanna\nbe clear, I'm not suggesting there is.\n\n365\n00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:34.447\nJust pointing out, what if there was,\nand what if I happened to trip across or\n\n366\n00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:37.495\nknew what it was,\ncuz I found it on a hacker site somewhere?\n\n367\n00:17:37.495 --> 00:17:40.840\nI may be able to type that URL and\ngo directly to the page.\n\n368\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.447\nAnd as long as I have the exact path and\nthe exact reference to the path,\n\n369\n00:17:44.447 --> 00:17:47.443\nI could go there and\nbypass all the frontend security, and\n\n370\n00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:49.057\nthey would never be the wiser.\n\n371\n00:17:49.057 --> 00:17:52.448\nSo, a lot of times,\nthe internal pages that are not meant for\n\n372\n00:17:52.448 --> 00:17:55.320\npublic consumption will operate this way.\n\n373\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.326\nAnd as a result, if they get\npublished without us realizing it,\n\n374\n00:17:58.326 --> 00:17:59.395\nwe may have a problem.\n\n375\n00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:03.470\nSo failure to restrict URL access,\nis akin of directory browsing.\n\n376\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.616\nIf we don't lock that down,\nwe know we've established we have issues,\n\n377\n00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:08.949\nthis may also be the problem\nthat we're facing here.\n\n378\n00:18:08.949 --> 00:18:12.835\nAgain, just another slice,\nanother movement left or right, one or\n\n379\n00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:14.245\ntwo notches on the dial.\n\n380\n00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:17.790\nAnd we wind up with a slightly\ndifferent variation of the same theme.\n\n381\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.792\nWe're not closely guarding access,\nvalidating access control,\n\n382\n00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:24.225\nunderstanding who's coming from where,\nand that leads to complications.\n\n383\n00:18:24.225 --> 00:18:27.800\nWe talked about insecure and\nimproper cryptographic use and storage.\n\n384\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.654\nWe talked about cookie modification,\n\n385\n00:18:29.654 --> 00:18:31.964\ncookie snooping would be\nanother example here.\n\n386\n00:18:31.964 --> 00:18:34.678\nOr maybe able to grab cookies in transit,\nsnoop them,\n\n387\n00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:37.750\nthen turn them back around to\nuse them to masquerade or spoof.\n\n388\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:43.320\nI talked about demilitarized zone hosting\nfor web servers, and DMZ protocol attacks.\n\n389\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.890\nI've mentioned those in one\nof our earlier discussions.\n\n390\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.220\nWhat about authentication hijacking?\n\n391\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.830\nCredential harvesting is\nessentially what this is.\n\n392\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.493\nWe're just trying to grab credentials that\nare sent across the wire, and then recycle\n\n393\n00:18:54.493 --> 00:18:57.517\nthem into the system if they're not\nsent in the clear, or, excuse me.\n\n394\n00:18:57.517 --> 00:18:59.551\nIf they are sent in the clear,\nthis will be a problem,\n\n395\n00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:01.465\nif they're not sent in the clear,\nthat's good.\n\n396\n00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:05.100\nThey should not be sent in the clear,\nbut we may be able to garner these.\n\n397\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.676\nRemember we talked about in some earlier\nepisodes the idea of rainbow table\n\n398\n00:19:08.676 --> 00:19:09.990\nattacks and hash attacks.\n\n399\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:16.870\nAnd the idea that we could take hashes of\nthe operating system's users' passwords.\n\n400\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.152\nAnd if they're stored and\nwe get access to them,\n\n401\n00:19:19.152 --> 00:19:23.178\nin the Sam Hiven Windows where we get them\nfrom, or just transmitted across the wire.\n\n402\n00:19:23.178 --> 00:19:26.780\nIf we see the hashes, we may just be\nable to use rainbow table attacks,\n\n403\n00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.057\nbe able to understand the hash, get,\nessentially through reverse engineering,\n\n404\n00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:33.090\nwhat the password was that created it.\n\n405\n00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.155\nIf we do that, we've got the username\nalready, most likely, and\n\n406\n00:19:36.155 --> 00:19:37.372\nnow we're able to log in.\n\n407\n00:19:37.372 --> 00:19:40.848\nSo it may not be that difficult to do,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n408\n00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:44.182\nWe may be able to do session hijacking,\nmasquerade as the user,\n\n409\n00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:46.468\nlegitimately log in and access resources,\n\n410\n00:19:46.468 --> 00:19:50.938\neven though we're not legitimately the\nuser, through authentication hijacking.\n\n411\n00:19:50.938 --> 00:19:54.792\nHidden field manipulation, this is kind\nof a twin brother of the XSS cross\n\n412\n00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:57.725\nsite scripting attacks that\nDaniel was talking about.\n\n413\n00:19:57.725 --> 00:20:01.420\nThat we could execute and\nhave been known to execute in the past.\n\n414\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.130\nThat's something that\nwe may be able to do.\n\n415\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.170\nWe talked about the concept,\nbut think about this.\n\n416\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.390\nHidden field manipulation would\nbe manipulating the hidden fields\n\n417\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.290\nthat are typically backing websites.\n\n418\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.382\nWe have a lot of times,\n\n419\n00:20:12.382 --> 00:20:15.438\ndata that is stored in hidden fields,\nwe may not directly see.\n\n420\n00:20:15.438 --> 00:20:19.819\nAnd if we can focus this attack in,\nwe may be able to modify information.\n\n421\n00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.490\nSo join me back here again.\n\n422\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.010\nAmazon, I'm not suggesting, again,\nto be clear, full disclaimer,\n\n423\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.630\nnot saying the site is vulnerable to this,\nnot saying we're doing this.\n\n424\n00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.460\nNot saying that this site would ever,\nin any way, shape or\n\n425\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.490\nform, necessarily have this problem.\n\n426\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.394\nJust using it merely as\na descriptive example.\n\n427\n00:20:36.394 --> 00:20:39.971\nGotta put those disclaimers out there,\nso we understand what we are and\n\n428\n00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:41.173\nare not talking about.\n\n429\n00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:45.256\nLet's say, hypothetically, this I guess\nwhat ad rotator bar, whatever you call it,\n\n430\n00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:47.280\nright here, buy 2 Echos and save $80.\n\n431\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.050\nThat sounds like it may or\nmay not be a good feel, I don't know.\n\n432\n00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.300\nI don't know how much Echos are going for\nthese days.\n\n433\n00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.721\nMy echos are free, echo, echo, echo.\n\n434\n00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:55.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to pay for them.\n\n435\n00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:59.299\nBut if you have to buy two of them and\nyou were looking to give out gifts and\n\n436\n00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:01.405\nsave $80, that may be valuable.\n\n437\n00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:05.706\nWhat if somebody was able to go in and\nmodify the hidden form field that\n\n438\n00:21:05.706 --> 00:21:09.020\nessentially generates\nthis ad on this rotator?\n\n439\n00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.173\nAnd instead of buy two, save 80,\nwhat if they said, buy four, save 800?\n\n440\n00:21:13.173 --> 00:21:16.002\nHm, right?\n\n441\n00:21:16.002 --> 00:21:17.043\n&gt;&gt; Amazon would be paying you.\n\n442\n00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:18.010\n&gt;&gt; Give me an $800 Amazon credit, exactly.\n\n443\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.741\nWe're gonna ship them to you for free.\n\n444\n00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:23.560\nWe're gonna give you four and\nwe're gonna pay you another,\n\n445\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.170\nI don't know how much that costs.\n\n446\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.637\nMaybe another $400, so\nthey cost 100 bucks apiece, whatever.\n\n447\n00:21:27.637 --> 00:21:31.780\nWe're gonna give you $400 in credit\non top of that, and give that to you.\n\n448\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.412\nWell if somebody was able to do that and\n\n449\n00:21:33.412 --> 00:21:36.320\nsuccessfully get that out there\nbefore anybody caught it, even for\n\n450\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.343\na small period of time,\nthat's a hidden field manipulation attack.\n\n451\n00:21:39.343 --> 00:21:43.865\nWe're modifying the hidden fields, this is\nreally an e-commerce centric attack, but\n\n452\n00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:47.675\nwe're modifying the hidden fields in\norder to change the way this goes on.\n\n453\n00:21:47.675 --> 00:21:51.190\nI think it was Southwest Airlines,\nit was either Southwest or JetBlue,\n\n454\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.370\nit may have happened to both of them,\nI don't remember exactly.\n\n455\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.708\nBut at least one of them in the last\ncouple of years had this happen.\n\n456\n00:21:56.708 --> 00:21:59.305\nNot directly, somebody didn't hack them,\nbut indirectly,\n\n457\n00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:01.224\nthey shot themselves in the foot and\ndid this.\n\n458\n00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:04.014\nSomebody who was responsible for\nputting content up on the web for them.\n\n459\n00:22:04.014 --> 00:22:08.170\nYou know how they do these last minute\nfare sales and those kind of stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.806\nSo they loaded up literally\nthe wrong set of information from\n\n461\n00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:14.028\nthe tables into the pricing matrix.\n\n462\n00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:18.942\nAnd instead of buy tickets for $25 off or\nwhatever, something happened, and\n\n463\n00:22:18.942 --> 00:22:22.264\nthey wound up putting up\na link that essentially said,\n\n464\n00:22:22.264 --> 00:22:25.313\nyou can buy tickets to anywhere we fly for\n$25.\n\n465\n00:22:25.313 --> 00:22:29.312\nAnd so they had sold thousands\nof these in minutes,\n\n466\n00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:32.382\nbefore they realized it and caught it.\n\n467\n00:22:32.382 --> 00:22:35.743\nThey took it down, but then the big debate\nwas, are they gonna honor the sales, or\n\n468\n00:22:35.743 --> 00:22:38.050\nare they gonna essentially say,\nno, it was a mistake?\n\n469\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.556\nAnd they wound up doing the right thing,\nthey honored the sales.\n\n470\n00:22:40.556 --> 00:22:43.760\nYou wound up having to pay a little bit\nmore, because you had to pay, by law,\n\n471\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.133\ninterestingly enough, at least in\nthe United States, and in most countries.\n\n472\n00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:50.467\nYou have to pay the minimum taxes\nthat the government requires and\n\n473\n00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:52.310\nimposes on an airline ticket.\n\n474\n00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.530\nThere's certain fees, and landing fees,\n\n475\n00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.580\nstuff like that the government\nimposes on airlines.\n\n476\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.290\nThey pass that along as part of\nthe ticket to you, essentially.\n\n477\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.470\nYou have to pay those even\nif you get a free ticket.\n\n478\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.890\nThe airline comps it, but the airline\nhas to pay those to the government.\n\n479\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.990\nSo somebody pays that, so\n\n480\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.480\ntypically you have to pay at\na minimum that amount for the ticket.\n\n481\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.883\nSo they actually had to go back and\nsay, okay, yeah, we'll honor it, but\n\n482\n00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:19.790\nyou gotta pay like $20 more for whatever\nthe fees are, and then you get the ticket.\n\n483\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.168\nAnd so it became a big deal, but\n\n484\n00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:24.880\nthey essentially fell victim to this\nthemselves, they did it to themselves.\n\n485\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.424\nSomebody manipulated the hidden fields in\nthe back end without realizing they had\n\n486\n00:23:28.424 --> 00:23:30.901\ndone it the wrong way, and\nas a result that was a problem.\n\n487\n00:23:30.901 --> 00:23:35.190\nWe like it when it's done, we just don't\nlet you pay for the outcome on that.\n\n488\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.546\nUnvalidated redirects and forwards, I'm\nsure you take advantage of this sometimes\n\n489\n00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:41.679\nwith your cross-site scripts, among\nother things, as you were suggesting.\n\n490\n00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:44.074\nUnvalidated redirects and\nforwards, as we said,\n\n491\n00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:47.859\nthis is where attackers lure the victims\nin, and have them click on these links,\n\n492\n00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.860\nwithout validating where they are.\n\n493\n00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.226\nI hovered over one of the links showing\nyou what the redirect would go to\n\n494\n00:23:53.226 --> 00:23:53.804\non Amazon.\n\n495\n00:23:53.804 --> 00:23:56.940\nWe could clearly see that it looks\nlike it's legitimate when we do that.\n\n496\n00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.201\nBut what if it goes off, and it goes\nto hackmeinthedark.org or something?\n\n497\n00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:04.346\nI mean, that's clearly not\nsome place you wanna go.\n\n498\n00:24:04.346 --> 00:24:07.403\nI'mlookingtostealyourmoney.com, don't\nclick on that link.\n\n499\n00:24:07.403 --> 00:24:11.437\nBut if you don't realize that, you may\nclick without realizing what it is.\n\n500\n00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:11.986\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n501\n00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:14.606\n&gt;&gt; So it too late to back out of that?\n\n502\n00:24:14.606 --> 00:24:17.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, can I unclick that?\n\n503\n00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:19.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One of the reasons I use a BlackBerry,\n\n504\n00:24:19.329 --> 00:24:20.632\none of the many reasons\nI use a BlackBerry.\n\n505\n00:24:20.632 --> 00:24:23.568\nAnd I am proud of using\na BlackBerry by the way,\n\n506\n00:24:23.568 --> 00:24:28.830\nis that I can preview a lot of that stuff\non the BlackBerry, on the secure browser.\n\n507\n00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.770\n[COUGH] And not worry about whether or\nnot I'm gonna infect my machine,\n\n508\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.400\nbecause I'm not using a traditional\nsystem to do that, right?\n\n509\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.652\nI'm not going out with a laptop that's\ngonna be infected with that malware.\n\n510\n00:24:38.652 --> 00:24:42.142\nIf that malware doesn't run on an Android,\nnow it's Android, but before,\n\n511\n00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:45.901\nif it didn't run on the Blackberry, well,\nthat's what you most often would not,\n\n512\n00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:48.300\nup until blackberry switched\nto Android recently.\n\n513\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.180\nOn my older Blackberries, I could preview\nthat stuff and I would not have a problem\n\n514\n00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.800\nbecause traditionally it would not\neffective install on the Blackberry.\n\n515\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.727\nSo I could preview those links\nfiguring out what they were.\n\n516\n00:24:58.727 --> 00:25:02.000\nLook, this is a hacking site and\nthen I could go do research on it but\n\n517\n00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.110\nit wouldn't actually infect the device.\n\n518\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.559\n&gt;&gt; That's great,\nthat's a great plug for Blackberry.\n\n519\n00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:09.650\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You can still do that if the Malware\n\n520\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.893\ndoesn't execute on Android, but\n\n521\n00:25:11.893 --> 00:25:16.900\nyou obviously have to be a lot more\ncareful and know a lot about it up front.\n\n522\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.680\nBut I'll use throwaway VMs for\nthe same reason.\n\n523\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.999\nWell, I say the VM-\n&gt;&gt; I do the same thing.\n\n524\n00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:21.655\n&gt;&gt; And you obviously do the same thing.\n\n525\n00:25:21.655 --> 00:25:23.584\nYou keep the memory isolated\nin what we call a sandbox.\n\n526\n00:25:23.584 --> 00:25:26.084\nAnd yeah, as a result,\nwe could do the same thing there.\n\n527\n00:25:26.084 --> 00:25:28.680\nOr I'll borrow a friend's phone and-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n528\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.376\n[LAUGH] Do you mind if I get\non your computer real quick?\n\n529\n00:25:30.376 --> 00:25:32.593\nI'm going to this\nhackmeinthedark.org site.\n\n530\n00:25:32.593 --> 00:25:33.833\nIt's awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta go shop.\n\n531\n00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:34.857\nI gotta get some gifts.\n\n532\n00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:37.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you may see some strange, but\n\n533\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.493\njust don't worry about it, it's not big.\n\n534\n00:25:39.493 --> 00:25:40.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't pay any attention, right?\n\n535\n00:25:40.364 --> 00:25:43.930\n[LAUGH] All right so,\nwhat about session fixation attacks?\n\n536\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.540\nProbably the last category, 28 of them in\nall we've been through, quite a bit, but\n\n537\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.710\nthe last one we wanna\nprobably throw out there.\n\n538\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.600\nSession fixation attacks.\n\n539\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.105\nWe try to trick the user into going out\nand accessing genuine web server using\n\n540\n00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:58.301\nsome sort of session ID value that\nwe've established ahead of time.\n\n541\n00:25:58.301 --> 00:26:00.990\nWe talked about this in\none of the other episodes.\n\n542\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.268\nWhere a search with the hacker would go\nout set up the session, create a unique\n\n543\n00:26:04.268 --> 00:26:07.253\nsession ID which you know is generated\nevery time we access a website.\n\n544\n00:26:07.253 --> 00:26:12.011\nWe would then send the link to the user,\nget them to click on it to open up\n\n545\n00:26:12.011 --> 00:26:15.330\na session to that web\nserver using that link.\n\n546\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.527\nThey have to validate and authenticate.\n\n547\n00:26:16.527 --> 00:26:20.131\nNow obviously the user has to number one,\nwanna go to this site, and number two,\n\n548\n00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:21.193\nhave a reason to log in.\n\n549\n00:26:21.193 --> 00:26:23.790\nSo you're not just hey,\nclick here and boom, you're done.\n\n550\n00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.450\nBut again, maybe to Amazon, right.\n\n551\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.853\nSo if I did that, got the user to\nlog in using my sponsored link,\n\n552\n00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:31.871\nI could then scrape their credentials,\nlogin as them,\n\n553\n00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:34.524\nand this becomes a masquerade or\na spoof attack.\n\n554\n00:26:34.524 --> 00:26:36.717\nIt's just another form\nof man in the middle,\n\n555\n00:26:36.717 --> 00:26:39.120\nis really what a session\nfixation attack is.\n\n556\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.100\nWe could exploit those credentials and\n\n557\n00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.010\nas a result take over that session from\nthe user and essentially become them,\n\n558\n00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.270\nwhether or not they realize it,\nbut that's what we would do.\n\n559\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.640\nSo there's a lot of different exploits out\nthere, lot of different things we have to\n\n560\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.520\nbe aware of, lot of different things\nwe have to be concerned about.\n\n561\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.540\nAnd when we think about that, we can\nroll that into your broader discussion\n\n562\n00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.810\nabout the methodology that we then\nwould use to investigate a web attack.\n\n563\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.170\nBut before we do that, you're gonna\nhave to come back and see us for\n\n564\n00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.920\nanother episode.\n\n565\n00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.200\nCuz we're almost out of time and\n\n566\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.380\nprobably not enough time left to\nwalk us through that methodology.\n\n567\n00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.124\nBut we do wanna interrupt\ncommon conversation and\n\n568\n00:27:11.124 --> 00:27:12.169\ngo through the methodology.\n\n569\n00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:15.482\nAs we do in many of these areas with you\nabout what the methodology would look like\n\n570\n00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:16.817\nto take all this knowledge, and\n\n571\n00:27:16.817 --> 00:27:19.570\nroll it into the steps involved\nto investigate web attacks.\n\n572\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.060\nYou've heard me talk a lot about\nthe different aspects and pieces.\n\n573\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.947\nWe're gonna put that together formally for\nyou, walk you through that.\n\n574\n00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:28.652\nWe'll take a look at some tools that we\ncan use to investigate web servers that\n\n575\n00:27:28.652 --> 00:27:29.980\nmay be running in Windows.\n\n576\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.250\nSo you just walk through some\ncommon tools there for you.\n\n577\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.404\nTake a look at logging a little bit on the\nIS, and as I mentioned one of the earlier\n\n578\n00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.204\nepisodes, on the web server\nplatforms like Apache.\n\n579\n00:27:39.204 --> 00:27:42.884\nI'm just talking about where traditional\nlogs are found, what's the structure and\n\n580\n00:27:42.884 --> 00:27:46.020\nthe format of an Apache log,\nyou may not realize what's in there.\n\n581\n00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.680\nAll the little percent S, percent T,\npercent R, things like that.\n\n582\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.120\nLanguage or syntax that you use,\nwe'll walk you through all that and\n\n583\n00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.150\nexplain how all that works.\n\n584\n00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.848\n&gt;&gt; Well that's gonna be a lot of fun, cuz\nthat's the side of the coin I need to bone\n\n585\n00:27:56.848 --> 00:27:59.580\nup on, so\nhopefully you're in the same boat as me.\n\n586\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.800\nAnd you'll come back, and we'll watch and\n\n587\n00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.100\nwe'll see how these things are done\nin an investigation process.\n\n588\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.010\nNow that we know what all the different\nattack vectors are that we might\n\n589\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.950\nbe working with.\n\n590\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.790\nThat being said, like Adam said, we're\na little bit out of time for this episode,\n\n591\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.580\nso we're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n592\n00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.073\nThank's for watching, definitely\ncome back for the next one though.\n\n593\n00:28:15.073 --> 00:28:18.140\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n594\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:18.790\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n595\n00:28:18.790 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:08.294\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:12.227\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.196\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n7\n00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:17.690\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.830\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.105\nAnd in todays episode, well, hope that\nyour in for some more on CFI version nine\n\n10\n00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.520\ncuz that's what were going through,\nspecifically, looking at the web\n\n11\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.380\napplication and web vulnerabilities,\nthat's a lot of good stuff there.\n\n12\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.651\nAnd joining us to continue that\nconversation, our good friend Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:36.720\nAdam Gordon, has so\ngraciously joined us again.\n\n14\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.330\nWelcome back, Adam.\n\n15\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.300\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't leave you.\n\n16\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.660\nI took the car keys and left and I have\nnowhere to go, so I kinda got stuck here.\n\n17\n00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.280\nSo I did decide to come back.\n\n18\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.320\nAnd hopefully,\n\n19\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.410\nwe will continue our conversations\nthe way it makes sense for you.\n\n20\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.470\nAlways appreciate the opportunity to spend\ntime with you, spending time talking,\n\n21\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.230\nin this case,\nabout how we investigate web attacks.\n\n22\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.830\nWe left off in part four.\n\n23\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.090\nIf you haven't seen those prior episodes,\njust really finishing up the thought\n\n24\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.340\nprocess around all the different kinds of\nattacks that may plague us in the web,\n\n25\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.480\nwent through 28 of them I think if i'm\nnot mistaken, and detailed them out.\n\n26\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.040\nDaniel was very helpful in helping to\nexplain, not only the methodology of some,\n\n27\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.730\nbut share some of his personal experiences\nabout things he's been involved with,\n\n28\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.385\nthings he's done by way of doing some\npen testing, vulnerability assessment,\n\n29\n00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.385\nthings like that.\n\n30\n00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.675\nAlways important to hear\nthe reality of what we do and\n\n31\n00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:26.055\nhow we do it, and mix that in with\nour knowledge of what we could do.\n\n32\n00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:29.952\nAnd really then take that and\nextrapolate that forward, so\n\n33\n00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:32.492\nwe understand how to\ninvestigate those attacks.\n\n34\n00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.202\nThat's what we're gonna\nfocus on right now.\n\n35\n00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:36.952\nI promise you, we will get into\nthe methodology conversation.\n\n36\n00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:41.112\nAnd if you join me right over here, we're\ngonna take a look at our methodology.\n\n37\n00:01:41.112 --> 00:01:45.692\nWe do have, as we often do with many\nof these particular knowledge areas,\n\n38\n00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:50.772\na methodology that is derived from common\nsense approaches, things that we've done\n\n39\n00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:54.330\nor talked about in many other areas,\nand many other approaches.\n\n40\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.650\nGonna roll those together.\n\n41\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.110\nCome up with a methodology.\n\n42\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.890\nWhy is this important?\n\n43\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.640\nSeveral reasons.\n\n44\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.040\nNumber one, certainly, if you're\nplanning on taking the exam, well,\n\n45\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.930\nyou know, we do tend to ask questions\nabout these kind of things.\n\n46\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870\nSo you do wanna make sure you know them.\n\n47\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.240\nNumber two, it's important cuz we wanna\nbe able to take this methodology,\n\n48\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.100\ncertainly localize it, modify it,\ntweak it, nip it, tuck it here and\n\n49\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.950\nthere in order to make it make\nsense in the real world for you\n\n50\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.920\nas you're doing the things that you have\nto do to be able to do investigations and\n\n51\n00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.000\nor carry out security related\nactivities in the real world.\n\n52\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.550\nAnd third and certainly not last,\nand not least by any means, well,\n\n53\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.520\nperhaps last, cuz it is number 3,\nbut not least by any means.\n\n54\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.300\nIt is important to be able to\ndocument what we're doing,\n\n55\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.430\nwrite down and\nstandardize our methodologies, so\n\n56\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.560\nthat people that will come\nafter us at some point can see,\n\n57\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.740\nby looking back on what we have done,\nthat we're doing it the right way.\n\n58\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.380\nWe can verify and validate, and\ntherefore, through an audit,\n\n59\n00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.850\nshow that we're doing the things\nwe're supposed to do.\n\n60\n00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.890\nBut all these reasons are very\nimportant to have a methodology and\n\n61\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.590\nto ensure that we're\ncommunicating in effectively\n\n62\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.940\nas people continue to come on board and\ncontinue to learn or\n\n63\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.090\nengage in these activities wanna\nstandardize the way they do that.\n\n64\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.970\nAnd as a result of that,\nensured that they are doing things\n\n65\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.310\naligned with the best practices,\nthe business values, the requirements, and\n\n66\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.060\nthe recommendations that\nare making us more secure.\n\n67\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.030\nSo you could see the 11 step\nmethodology on the screen there.\n\n68\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.210\nDaniel, I'm gonna ask you\na question if you don't mind.\n\n69\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.730\n&gt;&gt; I won't.\n\n70\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.160\n&gt;&gt; You, of the 11 steps that are there,\n\n71\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.740\nthere are many different\nways we can interpret this.\n\n72\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.330\nThere is no right or\nwrong answer, in other words,\n\n73\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.152\nto Daniel's answer to this question.\n\n74\n00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:23.665\n&gt;&gt; Hard drive.\n\n75\n00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:25.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we see, so\n\n76\n00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:28.372\nyou see [INAUDIBLE] what it is.\n\n77\n00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:31.590\nSo of the 11 steps, which one would\nyou say, and by the way they're not\n\n78\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.530\nlisted in importance but they're listed\nchronologically, in the order we would\n\n79\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.890\nengage in them in to investigate a web\nattack, just to be clear, as you look at\n\n80\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.600\nthose, there is a specific order there\nbased on, hey, we'd always have to make\n\n81\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.840\nsure we confirm that there is an attack\nbefore we even capture volatile data.\n\n82\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.893\nLike for instance, [INAUDIBLE] but\nthey are not listed in priority order but\n\n83\n00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:53.584\nrather chronological order.\n\n84\n00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:56.111\nBut having said that,\nwhich step up there would you feel,\n\n85\n00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.773\njust from your experiences in the real\nworld, doing things you've done, which one\n\n86\n00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:03.305\ndo you think would be the most critical,\nthe most important for us to execute on.\n\n87\n00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:04.823\nLet's see here, that's a great question.\n\n88\n00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:05.513\n&gt;&gt; Take a moment.\nObviously, [CROSSTALK] think about it.\n\n89\n00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:09.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, let's see,\nwe've got confirmation of the attack,\n\n90\n00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:14.262\ncapture volatile data, snapshot\nthe system, shut down, if physical,\n\n91\n00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:17.500\ncapture forensic imaging\nand/or mount snapshot,\n\n92\n00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.209\napplication documentation,\nanalyze log files, collect application and\n\n93\n00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:25.889\nhost configuration files,\nidentify abnormal activity,\n\n94\n00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.644\ncross-walk against firewalls and IDS-\n&gt;&gt; IDPS\n\n95\n00:04:28.644 --> 00:04:29.259\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, IDPS.\n\n96\n00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.130\n&gt;&gt; Either way, just combining them.\n\n97\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.510\n&gt;&gt; I would say, probably attempt,\n\n98\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.520\nno, not attempt to block the attack.\nYou might want to allow it to continue for\n\n99\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.980\ninformation gathering purposes.\n\n100\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.820\nSo I might go with, this is a though one.\n\n101\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.540\nI will say,\nsnapshot the system at virtual.\n\n102\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.240\n&gt;&gt; So we're saying number 3, cuz it's\nusually a number so we can refer to it.\n\n103\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Trying to mitigate the damage\nthat could possibly being done.\n\n104\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.830\nMaybe block the attack as well.\n\n105\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.410\n&gt;&gt; So maybe number 10 right,\njust looking at the list.\n\n106\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 3 and\n10 seem to be kind of like hand in hand.\n\n107\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right, so, and as I\nsaid, when we started this conversation,\n\n108\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.910\nno right and wrong answer here.\n\n109\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.540\nJust interested in what\nanother security professional,\n\n110\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.840\nsomebody who has been in the field,\ndoing this kind of work,\n\n111\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.390\nmay view this list as what would they say,\nwhat would you say?\n\n112\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.470\nPrepare to press your buzzers at home.\n\n113\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.300\nWe're going to light up the phone lines,\nstart taking input from you.\n\n114\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.120\nRemember, from my perspective,\nI'm only sharing with you my opinion, and\n\n115\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.920\nDaniel's kind enough to play along and\nshare his, and\n\n116\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.025\nno right and wrong way to interpret this,\njust merely opinion.\n\n117\n00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:36.245\nIf I was looking at that list and thinking\nof it and perhaps thinking of a question\n\n118\n00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:40.337\nthat I may get asked on an exam, you have\nthe methodology item associated with\n\n119\n00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:44.325\ninvestigating web attacks chronologically,\nobviously, what goes before or after what.\n\n120\n00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:46.050\nThat's a pretty clear set of questions.\n\n121\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.590\nWhich of those would be the most\ncritical to execute on successfully?\n\n122\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.380\nI would take a slightly\ndifferent approach.\n\n123\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.548\nI would focus in on step number one.\n\n124\n00:05:53.548 --> 00:05:55.940\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna go with step number one,\nbut\n\n125\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.000\ni assumed that we had\nalready gotten to that part.\n\n126\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.135\nBut there it is in the list, so.\n\n127\n00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:02.582\n&gt;&gt; But it is and yet you shared with\nus a critical thought process and\n\n128\n00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:04.726\na critical tell in your thought process,\nyou assumed.\n\n129\n00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n130\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.356\n&gt;&gt; And you know, and we often talk\nabout the fact that this is one\n\n131\n00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:11.209\nof the few activities that can cause\nus even greater harm, perhaps,\n\n132\n00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:14.666\nthan the attacker who's figured out a way-\n&gt;&gt; With denial of service ourselves.\n\n133\n00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We shoot ourselves in the foot because\n\n134\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.860\nit wasn't good enough the first time,\nwe wanted to go back and redo it again,\n\n135\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.560\nmake sure we got it right, right?\n\n136\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.780\nFrom my perspective,\nreason I would zero in on step number one\n\n137\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.580\nis just what it says, do we actually\nhave confirmation of the attack?\n\n138\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.710\nIn other words, if we are not 100%, and\nwe can never be a 100%, let's be clear,\n\n139\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.000\nbut if we're not aligned with the idea\nthat we are pretty confident,\n\n140\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.880\nthat we have an attack on our hands, and\ntherefore, have to kick off all these\n\n141\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.540\nother things that I'm actually gonna do\nthat just to separate them specifically.\n\n142\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:54.990\nBecause if we are not sure that\nwe have item number 1 relatively\n\n143\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.870\ndocumented, relatively in our minds\nhappening, all those other steps,\n\n144\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.900\nwhile they are very important, will make\nabsolutely no sense for us to engage in.\n\n145\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.900\nAnd we may actually, purposefully, be\nbeing fed information that may indicate,\n\n146\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.610\nand we've seen a lot of evidence\nof this in various attacks,\n\n147\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.420\nmay indicate to us that\nthere is something going on.\n\n148\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.626\nBut if we don't stop,\ntake our time to be critical,\n\n149\n00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.386\nand make sure that we're chasing\nsomething that is legitimate,\n\n150\n00:07:19.386 --> 00:07:22.714\nnot what I call a purple squirrel, you\nknow why we call them purple squirrels?\n\n151\n00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:23.806\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they don't exist?\n\n152\n00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:24.522\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n153\n00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:25.289\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's no such thing as\n\n154\n00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:25.837\na purple squirrel.\n\n155\n00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:27.115\n&gt;&gt; Well, there could be.\n\n156\n00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:29.295\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There should not be.\n\n157\n00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:30.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Based on the way the laws of\n\n158\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.770\nnature work, we should not normally see.\n\n159\n00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.420\n&gt;&gt; We have glowing cats now.\n\n160\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.485\n&gt;&gt; We, yes, but abnormal,\nwell, they may be.\n\n161\n00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:38.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We should not normally see,\n\n162\n00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:39.133\npurple unicorns.\n\n163\n00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:41.932\n[CROSSTALK] We do not\nchase purple unicorns.\n\n164\n00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:44.041\nThe reason for that-\n&gt;&gt; Taylor, give me a horse.\n\n165\n00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:44.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n166\n00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:49.225\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And we need a purple marker,\n\n167\n00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:53.335\nand some spray paint really quickly,\noff camera, before we finish up.\n\n168\n00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:58.164\nSo the idea is that if what we're reacting\nto something that purposely is spun\n\n169\n00:07:58.164 --> 00:08:03.066\nout there as bait To distract us right,\nto move us away from paying attention to\n\n170\n00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.370\nour real infrastructure\nthat should be protected.\n\n171\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.870\nBut if we're not vigilant, now the bad\nactors may actually be able to get in and\n\n172\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.390\nmay actually be able to do harm\nbecause we're not paying attention.\n\n173\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.986\nThis is a known, tried and\ntrue methodology,\n\n174\n00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:17.991\na mechanism that is used to attack.\n\n175\n00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:19.030\n&gt;&gt; It's like a red herring.\n\n176\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.481\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\nred herrings are a fake, right?\n\n177\n00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.935\nWe will create confusion and\nsow the seeds of discord over there and\n\n178\n00:08:23.935 --> 00:08:26.968\nthen while you're chasing that,\nputting out that fire.\n\n179\n00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:30.188\nWe're just gonna walk right through the\nfront door when nobody is paying attention\n\n180\n00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:31.477\nand go do the things we have to do.\n\n181\n00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.610\nAnd I'm not suggesting\nthat that always happens.\n\n182\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.603\nQuite the opposite,\ndoes not happen very often.\n\n183\n00:08:35.603 --> 00:08:39.976\nBut I am just pointing out that from\nmy perspective, where I would focus my\n\n184\n00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:44.773\nattention in this methodology if I was\nweighing the concerns around activity and\n\n185\n00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:48.181\nthe investment of time and\nenergy to pursue an activity.\n\n186\n00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:52.004\nI would wanna make sure I'm pursuing\nsomething that legitimately has to be\n\n187\n00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:55.380\npursued before I invest the time\nto do any of the other things.\n\n188\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.327\nNow having said that,\nI would then line up with him,\n\n189\n00:08:57.327 --> 00:08:59.333\nI would certainly agree\nwith Daniel's assessment.\n\n190\n00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:03.723\nIf, to his point, if I make the assumption\nthat we already have an attack that has in\n\n191\n00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:06.535\nsome ways have been validated, then yeah.\n\n192\n00:09:06.535 --> 00:09:07.380\nI'd wanna go ahead and\n\n193\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.910\nI'd wanna go after the other things\ncertainly in a chronological order.\n\n194\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.419\nBut I would be thinking snapshotting or\n\n195\n00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:17.761\nsomehow capturing the information\nin the system, very critical.\n\n196\n00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.761\nTrying to block the attack,\nI agree with you,\n\n197\n00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:21.873\nI would just take it in\na slightly different way.\n\n198\n00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:26.913\nI would say that all those other steps\nessentially from let's say maybe two\n\n199\n00:09:26.913 --> 00:09:32.120\nto three on are gonna help us to then\nbe prepared to block the attack, right?\n\n200\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.272\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Think that we see a lot of importance\n\n201\n00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:38.670\nin those things cuz it will really\nbe difficult to block the attack.\n\n202\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:44.330\nWe hadn't analyzed the log files if we\nhadn't looked at the config information.\n\n203\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.050\nLook for that normal activity.\n\n204\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.055\nCross reference firewall IDPS.\n\n205\n00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:50.498\nPerhaps other router logs,\nthings like that,\n\n206\n00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:52.827\nthat may show access control modification.\n\n207\n00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:54.187\nThere's a lot of things we wanna look at.\n\n208\n00:09:54.187 --> 00:09:57.850\nBut it'll be hard to tell for sure,\nthat we were armed and ready to go and\n\n209\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.479\nreally understood the attack\nfactor well enough to\n\n210\n00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:03.430\nattempt to block it if we\ndidn't do some of those things.\n\n211\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.949\nEspecially, the IDPS portion\nbecause if we have more modern IDPS\n\n212\n00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:11.411\nhybrid systems that are gonna\nbe able to respond.\n\n213\n00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.743\nThey may actually have\nalready attempted to move and\n\n214\n00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:16.509\nblock the attack in real time\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n215\n00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:20.461\nAnd we want to see evidence of that and\nensure that that seems to be accurately\n\n216\n00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:23.671\nhandling the attack,\nbecause what we will see a lot of times,\n\n217\n00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:28.183\nis that we'll see incremental attacks that\ntry different probes, different ports,\n\n218\n00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:29.590\ndifferent avenues.\n\n219\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.010\nAnd one gets blocked, but you know\nthey're walking through the ports, and\n\n220\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.770\nwe're now seeing inbound DVOS\ntraffic coming in the next port.\n\n221\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.330\nAnd the next IP,\n\n222\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.170\nand so we may have to be ever vigilant\nthere to continue that block.\n\n223\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.350\nSo, I like the way Daniel answered it.\n\n224\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.910\nI think it puts it in a really\ngreat perspective for us.\n\n225\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.810\nBut I just wanted to make\nsure we step back and\n\n226\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.520\nunderstood that the critical\ncomponent there\n\n227\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.100\nis really making sure we're not\nchasing a phantom or a ghost, right?\n\n228\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably a good idea.\n\n229\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.390\n&gt;&gt; Good to think about.\n\n230\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just as a thought, right?\n\n231\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.338\nSo having said that, let's take a look at\nsome practical application of some of this\n\n232\n00:11:01.338 --> 00:11:04.534\nknowledge on some of the tools\nthat may be on the Windows side.\n\n233\n00:11:04.534 --> 00:11:08.037\nWould help us do a little investigation\nof web attacks against web-based\n\n234\n00:11:08.037 --> 00:11:10.880\ninfrastructure, web servers\nin the Windows world.\n\n235\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.203\nI've an Admin console open here.\n\n236\n00:11:13.203 --> 00:11:15.406\nSo you can see I'm running it\nunder the admin credential.\n\n237\n00:11:15.406 --> 00:11:18.892\nAlways important to be thinking about\nthat, knowing that that's the case, right?\n\n238\n00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:21.666\nBecause we may go to execute\nsome tools that may not work and\n\n239\n00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.658\nmay not give us back the proper response.\n\n240\n00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:27.148\nMost of these command line tools will work\neither way but you know something like\n\n241\n00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:30.397\nipconfig does not require admin\ncredentials in Windows traditionally.\n\n242\n00:11:30.397 --> 00:11:34.443\nBut in a heavily modified heavily\nknocked down, heavily templated and\n\n243\n00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.610\nbaseline system, it may.\n\n244\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.955\nWe may block access and so we do want to\nknow that, so just keeping that in mind.\n\n245\n00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:43.951\nAll right, so Daniel tell me if you\nlike the tools I'm putting up or\n\n246\n00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:47.285\nmaybe have some experience with them or\nmay have seen or will see new ones.\n\n247\n00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; That you haven't seen before, right.\n\n248\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:54.640\nSo what about a tool like Netview, right\nwe can go in, give this just a second.\n\n249\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.102\nWe may wanna go in and\nwhen we're using nNtview we will see\n\n250\n00:11:58.102 --> 00:12:02.517\ntraditionally just the open shares\nthat are going to be available here.\n\n251\n00:12:02.517 --> 00:12:06.641\nYeah, we're seeing a bunch of different\nshares that are available, so you could\n\n252\n00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:10.726\nsee I've got a bunch of different stuff\nthat may be mounted in or available here.\n\n253\n00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:11.726\n&gt;&gt; Dagobah, I like that.\n\n254\n00:12:11.726 --> 00:12:12.818\n&gt;&gt; Dagobah, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:12:12.818 --> 00:12:16.434\n&gt;&gt; We've got some Star Wars fans going on\n\n256\n00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:17.114\nhere.\n\n257\n00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:20.830\nIf we just move this up just a smidge so\nI can scroll down.\n\n258\n00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.999\nNow Netview by itself just gives me\na broad listing of any shares that may be\n\n259\n00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:26.759\navailable that I can discern.\n\n260\n00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:29.630\nIf I wanna target a specific machine,\nright?\n\n261\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.468\nWe can go in, look at the help file and\nyou'll see I could specify the computer\n\n262\n00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:37.533\nname, I can look at the cache,\nI can look at all.\n\n263\n00:12:37.533 --> 00:12:41.310\nI can specify a domain, if I'm domain\njoined or I wanna target a certain domain.\n\n264\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.430\nI can put in an IP address, by the way\ndoesn't have to be a machine name, right?\n\n265\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.139\nSo I could do net view 192.168.0.4 and\ntarget that.\n\n266\n00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:48.907\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n267\n00:12:48.907 --> 00:12:52.010\n&gt;&gt; So I could use that to\nstart zeroing in on things.\n\n268\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.780\nWould access to or\nknowledge of shares be important for\n\n269\n00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.520\nlooking at web related attacks?\n\n270\n00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.630\nWell yeah if they're shares that\nare out there that are made available,\n\n271\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.390\nprobably be good to know that right?\n\n272\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.860\nSo we would wanna know that, would wanna\nhave that information available to us.\n\n273\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.420\nWhat about another net command.\n\n274\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.340\nNet by the way is a gateway\nto all sorts of commands.\n\n275\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.612\nRight a command block\nin the Windows world.\n\n276\n00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:16.400\nIt has so\nmany different tools associated with it.\n\n277\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.760\nNet view, net session,\nas I'm about to show you.\n\n278\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.775\nGot a couple of others coming up,\nnet stat, net use, etc.\n\n279\n00:13:21.775 --> 00:13:24.200\nSo a lot of depth,\na lot of capabilities there.\n\n280\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.270\nWe shouldn't overlook the obvious tools\nlaying in the OS that are available to us.\n\n281\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.792\nThey are sometimes and\nquite often very valuable add-ons for\n\n282\n00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:35.860\nadditional information\ngathering on the spot, right?\n\n283\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.380\nIn real time against the machine.\n\n284\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.790\nWe don't wanna underestimate that,\nit's very, very important.\n\n285\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.810\nSo net session,\nanother one that maybe valuable, right?\n\n286\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.130\nWe don't have any remote shares or\nsessions that are opened up,\n\n287\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.420\nI'm not connected to anything or\nhave anybody connected to me.\n\n288\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.980\nBut you could see there,\nyou do net session list.\n\n289\n00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.060\nList is implied when I do it that way and\nI have it.\n\n290\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.160\nI mean you could see I could reach out\nto a specific computer looking for\n\n291\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.070\nthat as well, right?\n\n292\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.480\nSo I can use these,\nwe talked about net use.\n\n293\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.900\nSo I said net use.\n\n294\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.420\nYou'd use c or net use on use as in\nyou'se guys right over there, right?\n\n295\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.481\nSo you'll see I do have a map to the\ndrive, the z drive here that is mapped out\n\n296\n00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:16.100\nto the admin or\nhidden share of the local C drive.\n\n297\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.818\nAdmin directory on another machine.\n\n298\n00:14:17.818 --> 00:14:19.205\nAcross another Windows network.\n\n299\n00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:22.212\nWould that piece of information alone for\nan attacker and also for\n\n300\n00:14:22.212 --> 00:14:24.025\nan investigator prove to be valuable?\n\n301\n00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:27.055\nYeah, I can think of a lot of things I\nwould do with that if I was an attacker\n\n302\n00:14:27.055 --> 00:14:30.187\nand I can also think of a lot of things\nas an investigator that would help me to\n\n303\n00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:30.815\nunderstand.\n\n304\n00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:34.530\nI would want to know why that drive is\nmapped, why is it currently unavailable?\n\n305\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.560\nWas it available during\nthe time of the attack?\n\n306\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.920\nWhat's in that drive?\n\n307\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.790\nWhy am I looking at it and what's so\n\n308\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.305\nimportant about connecting to it that I\nleft it mapped as a drive on this machine?\n\n309\n00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:45.741\nI'd want to have the answers\nto those questions,\n\n310\n00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:49.743\nbecause somewhere in that set of questions\nthere may be something that's going to\n\n311\n00:14:49.743 --> 00:14:51.728\nhelp get to the next piece of the puzzle.\n\n312\n00:14:51.728 --> 00:14:56.353\nAnd as a result, put another piece into\nmy overall understanding of what may have\n\n313\n00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:57.930\nhappened and why?\n\n314\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.810\nAnd that's gonna be very important for us.\n\n315\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.224\nWe get into some other tools here, nbt,\n\n316\n00:15:02.224 --> 00:15:05.923\nyou remember all that trouble I\nhad the last time I tried this.\n\n317\n00:15:05.923 --> 00:15:07.038\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n318\n00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:08.752\n&gt;&gt; Well apparently it hasn't debated,\nit's still there.\n\n319\n00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:09.990\n&gt;&gt; It's not going away.\n\n320\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:15.310\n&gt;&gt; So nbtstat is a tool that does\nallow us to see all sorts of stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:20.030\nWhen we do a -S, we look at as you can\nsee, different connections that may be\n\n322\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.590\nthere for [COUGH] different endpoints or\ndifferent connections on the machine.\n\n323\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:30.067\nBut nbtstat overall again, right,\nyou may not be familiar with it.\n\n324\n00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:33.270\nI could do -a for adapter.\n\n325\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.620\nI could do minus c for cash I can do\nminus capital s for sessions, sessions\n\n326\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.000\nwith destination IPs things like that I\ncan do all sorts of stuff here right.\n\n327\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.970\nSo if I do NBT Stat and I go in and\n\n328\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:53.920\nI use either my capital a or\nlowercase a or whatever the case may be.\n\n329\n00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.868\nI may be able to get certain information.\n\n330\n00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:57.713\nI don't have anything currently connected,\n\n331\n00:15:57.713 --> 00:16:00.089\nthat's why I just keep getting\nthe help file cycling back.\n\n332\n00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:03.766\nThere's nothing currently In the system\nthat I'm running on or that is connected,\n\n333\n00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:05.076\nbut you get the general idea.\n\n334\n00:16:05.076 --> 00:16:09.985\nI just don't have any information\nthat currently would be appropriate\n\n335\n00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:11.910\nto show with Nbtstat.\n\n336\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.870\nWhat about netstat, another tool\nthat would be valuable, right,\n\n337\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.090\nwe could do Netstat.\n\n338\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.860\nNow normally to do netstat -a, look for\n\n339\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.900\nopen connections supposed to Nbtstat for\nNetBIOS resolution for names.\n\n340\n00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:31.170\nAnd netstat by itself -a will show\nus the other protocol TCP UDP\n\n341\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:36.630\naddress that I'm connected to, the state\nthat I'm in etc, so that will be helpful.\n\n342\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.890\nWe could also do netstat -na which\nwill put that same information out,\n\n343\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.780\njust format it in a little bit nicer,\n\n344\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.790\neasier to just interact with, and look at\ntable, just a little bit cleaner, right?\n\n345\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.340\nWe just have a little more information\nthere, but essentially looks the same.\n\n346\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.670\nWhat about, this is one people often,\nI'll just clear the screen out again so\n\n347\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.320\nwe can see,\nthis is one people often overlook.\n\n348\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.160\nI don't know if this is something\nyou look at at all, the scheduled\n\n349\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.280\ntask executable for a scheduled\ntask running on the local machine.\n\n350\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.820\nRemember we don't need to comply exe,\nthe command prompt automatically assumes\n\n351\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.240\neverything is executable, and\ntries that before it tries anything else.\n\n352\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.370\nBut you'll see here,\nthat I just outputted the schedule tasks\n\n353\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.840\nthat are set up a rather\nlong list apparently.\n\n354\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.708\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few.\n&gt;&gt; That are set up in the system here and\n\n355\n00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:29.104\nthat I can now have knowledge of.\n\n356\n00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:33.262\nAnd I may want to output that into a file,\nhave that available for\n\n357\n00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:37.520\nme to go through.I'll find,\nlook at and start debunking.\n\n358\n00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.910\nWhy do I have the Google Update Task\nrunning, well,\n\n359\n00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.460\nit's probably scheduled cuz I have\nGoogle software running, right?\n\n360\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.860\nAdobe Acrobat Update Task, right, the next\ntime it will run, it gives me a date and\n\n361\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.140\ntime and says okay I'm teed up and\nI'm gonna run this day and time.\n\n362\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.505\nIf I start seeing some strange\nstuff in here like instead of\n\n363\n00:17:54.505 --> 00:18:00.070\nuser_feed_syncronization, let's just say\nthat's a malware update or something.\n\n364\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.590\nObviously, I'd say well that's unusual,\nbut it may not be that obvious, right?\n\n365\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.724\nBut if I'm not running any\nAdobe products at all,\n\n366\n00:18:05.724 --> 00:18:09.880\nseeing the Adobe Acrobat update task\nwould hopefully set off a red flag.\n\n367\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.530\nWhile somebody is loading something,\n\n368\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.380\nmaybe they're trying to sneak\nit in under the water and\n\n369\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.690\ncall it Adobe Acrobat update cuz who\nwould think about that as being unusual?\n\n370\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.190\nI mean, who doesn't have some sort of\nAdobe product running on their system?\n\n371\n00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.770\nIt's very likely that we would not see\nsomething like a PDF reader, right?\n\n372\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.060\nSo it's pretty obvious\nthat that should be there.\n\n373\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.000\nBut maybe my baseline says\nno Adobe used at all.\n\n374\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.090\nThat should set off some very large\nred flags and alerts and sirens.\n\n375\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.240\nSo scheduled tasks allows me to be able to\nsee whatever has been teed up and running.\n\n376\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.680\nNow could I go into the tasks manager,\nor could I go in and\n\n377\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.290\nuse the @commandscheduler to\nsee the same information?\n\n378\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.050\nI can dump this,\nit's not the only way to do this.\n\n379\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.420\nBut a lot of times people overlook, the\nchoices that we make may not be the most\n\n380\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.460\nobvious and over look the fact that there\nmay be more than one way to do this.\n\n381\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:03.174\nHere's another one, lusrmgr,\nso the local user manager.\n\n382\n00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:04.336\n&gt;&gt; The loser manager.\n\n383\n00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:05.524\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The loser manager.\n\n384\n00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:07.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The local user manager on the system,\n\n385\n00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:10.872\nagain, could you go to admin tools and\nfind this, yes of course you could,\n\n386\n00:19:10.872 --> 00:19:13.200\nit wouldn't be hard to do,\nthis is not unusual.\n\n387\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.210\nCould you make your own NMC app and\nload that, yeah,\n\n388\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.580\nof course you could absolutely.\n\n389\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.290\nBut could you write from the command\nline that colony NMC, right so\n\n390\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.510\njust be aware of that.\n\n391\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.685\nSo that would let us see users, right?\n\n392\n00:19:23.685 --> 00:19:25.921\nAlways wanna go an see what\nusers are on the system,\n\n393\n00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.692\nalways wanna see what groups are there.\n\n394\n00:19:27.692 --> 00:19:31.635\nThat's one of the very first things we do\nis we look for those accounts that had\n\n395\n00:19:31.635 --> 00:19:34.990\nbeen created or group memberships\nas you can see right here.\n\n396\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.750\nOne of the groups we wanna target.\n\n397\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.100\nYeah I wanna look and\nsee who is in that admin group,\n\n398\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.880\nwho is this Nate guy that keep showing\nin up there,why is he in there,\n\n399\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.770\nthe cause of all\nthe trouble we have right?\n\n400\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.460\nWhat about that host account, why is that\nin there, what's going on with that?\n\n401\n00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.140\nI don't I don't know,\nI mean in most systems, in your systems,\n\n402\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.910\nright, you wouldn't see Nate, our host\nin there in the admin group locally.\n\n403\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.180\nClearly there are reasons Nate is gonna\nbe there because he's made the VMs for\n\n404\n00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.820\nus, very kind of him to do that for me.\n\n405\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.580\nAnd as a result, his account is there cuz\nhe used that account to set it up, right,\n\n406\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.020\nso that's important to know.\n\n407\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.300\nBut if I didn't know that, that would\nraise a little item of interest for me,\n\n408\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.500\nI wanna flag that.\n\n409\n00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.600\nI wanna go ahead and I want to\ninvestigate, right, other areas, right,\n\n410\n00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.910\nmaybe Hyper-V admin.\n\n411\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.670\nBut remember,\nwe may not use the obvious approach.\n\n412\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.680\nDomain admin or admin local gives me full\nrights but that's so obvious, right,\n\n413\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.075\nthat's so yesterday, right?\n\n414\n00:20:25.075 --> 00:20:26.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, instead what if\n\n415\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.820\nwe were gonna grab the dynamic account\nthat has more restricted rights but\n\n416\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.340\nmay have certain rights that we could\nleverage to execute other things right?\n\n417\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.650\nIf I just wanna be able to\nspin up a VM and run that VM,\n\n418\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.630\nmaybe then launch my attack from there,\nall I want is hyper v admin rights.\n\n419\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.340\nI don't need full admin rights right, so I\nmay want that, I may go after that group.\n\n420\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.969\nSo there's things here that\nI wanna be aware of right?\n\n421\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.396\nWhat about the net start command,\nright,what does net start do for us?\n\n422\n00:20:53.396 --> 00:20:57.930\nAgain overlooking some things that\nyou may take for granted shows us all\n\n423\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.200\nof the services, the Windows\nservices that are currently running.\n\n424\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.850\nCould I then take the output of this list,\ncompare it to my task manager output,\n\n425\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.770\ncompare it to other tools like plist and\nsee whether or\n\n426\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.890\nnot I've got the same data\nacross all the interfaces.\n\n427\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:17.170\nAnd if I don't, it would zero in on some\nof those running processes that show up in\n\n428\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.250\none, we showed you autoruns\nin a prior episode, right?\n\n429\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.150\nNot in this particular discussionary, but\n\n430\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.980\nin other shows we went through a tool\ncalled autoruns that should show us\n\n431\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.020\nall running processes and we talked\nabout rootkits and things like that.\n\n432\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.270\nIf I saw some stuff listed in one I\ndidn't see in others, guess what, right?\n\n433\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.310\nThat is the process I'm gonna start\nspending a lot of time with, because\n\n434\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.010\nthat's most likely a process that I need\nto know more about as an investigator,\n\n435\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.450\ncuz it's probably malware.\n\n436\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.920\nCould been the reason why the system was\nmodified in some way, attacked, whatever.\n\n437\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.200\nAnd I wanna zero in on that, I wanna\nlook for things that are non-obvious but\n\n438\n00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.140\nthat stand out when I do comparisons and\ndo not belong.\n\n439\n00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.780\nSo that's just a quick idea of six or\nseven different tools that\n\n440\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.020\nare built right in, I don't even\nneed to go out and get anything.\n\n441\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.330\nThese are just natively in Windows, right,\nbut I can use what's in the operating\n\n442\n00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.690\nsystem to be able to do a lot of the leg\nwork I need as I start to investigate.\n\n443\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.640\nAnd this will be part of the methodology\nwhat we should hopefully\n\n444\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.190\nbe part of the methodology and\nthe approach that you're thinking of, and\n\n445\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.310\nhopefully that is making sense for you.\n\n446\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.570\nSo did you see anything\nin there that was cool?\n\n447\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean, some definite oldies but\n\n448\n00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.399\ngoodies, we tend to rely heavily on things\nlike like net view and net use, and\n\n449\n00:22:24.399 --> 00:22:28.812\nnbtstat, that's a good one,\na lot of good information can come out.\n\n450\n00:22:28.812 --> 00:22:31.860\n&gt;&gt; That BIOS, that kinda name resolution,\nthat's in the cache there.\n\n451\n00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.940\nAs you saw when nothing's in there,\nyou essentially get nothing but\n\n452\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.280\nobviously if I would connect out to\na machine, I'd have entries in there.\n\n453\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.050\nRemember not every tool's gonna\nproduce that because data\n\n454\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.960\nevery time because there just may not be\nstuff in there and that's perfectly fine,\n\n455\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.720\nyou should expect that that will happen.\n\n456\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.390\nYou should be pleasantly surprised when\nyou get data in other words instead of\n\n457\n00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.800\nassuming, right, always be thankful.\n\n458\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.112\nSo tie the web of web applications,\n\n459\n00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:55.685\nwe would really be remiss if we\ndidn't talk a little about logging.\n\n460\n00:22:55.685 --> 00:22:58.935\nI mentioned logging would be a focus for\nus, join me back over here,\n\n461\n00:22:58.935 --> 00:23:01.215\njust wanna show you that\nyou do have this site for\n\n462\n00:23:01.215 --> 00:23:05.080\nyou in the show notes a little primer and\nbackground in the IIS log file formats.\n\n463\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.060\nDon't let the IIs 6 reference\nthere throw you or fool you,\n\n464\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.860\nthe log format information is still gonna\nbe routed for the new versions of IIS.\n\n465\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.350\nSo it may be helpful just to\ngive you a little primer there,\n\n466\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.695\nremember web server log files\nare gonna be log files.\n\n467\n00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:23.290\nIIS, Apache, Examp whatever a log\nin other words I'm suggesting\n\n468\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.620\nregardless of what goes into it,\nregardless of the structure and\n\n469\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.600\nthe way which we do the logging\ngenerically as a concept.\n\n470\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.590\nLog files are log files right,\napplications are gonna create output data,\n\n471\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.110\na lot of it goes in the log files.\n\n472\n00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.800\nWe know where to look so\nwe can find it and we can then use it.\n\n473\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.287\nSo we gotta keep in mind, the log\nfiles are very important for us, and\n\n474\n00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:43.031\nthings that we do wanna spend on and\n\n475\n00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:46.365\nfocus on have a little bit of\nbetter understanding of let's say.\n\n476\n00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:50.013\nBecause we are gonna be able to use\ncertain codes in those log files or\n\n477\n00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:54.365\nsome piece of information to correlate\nagainst activities in he outside world,\n\n478\n00:23:54.365 --> 00:23:56.980\nin the server 12, 12 R2.\n\n479\n00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.327\nKind of Windows Server side.\n\n480\n00:23:58.327 --> 00:24:03.155\nLog files traditionally are stored in the\nsystem drive, so typically C:\\Windows, but\n\n481\n00:24:03.155 --> 00:24:06.714\n%SystemDrive% as a variable is\nwhat we would often put in there,\n\n482\n00:24:06.714 --> 00:24:08.000\njust as a placeholder.\n\n483\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.780\nSo the system knows to substitute\nin the installation path.\n\n484\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.394\nSo typically C:\\Windows, right?\n\n485\n00:24:13.394 --> 00:24:17.501\nInet pub, you've heard me mention that\ndirectory before, logs and then log files.\n\n486\n00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:21.592\nSo we will typically delve into that\ndirectory in Windows to look for\n\n487\n00:24:21.592 --> 00:24:25.570\nthat information when we're looking for\nIIS related logs.\n\n488\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.755\nAnd we're then going to, hopefully,\nin our mind, know that IIS logs using UTC,\n\n489\n00:24:29.755 --> 00:24:31.828\nUniversal Time Coordination, right?\n\n490\n00:24:31.828 --> 00:24:35.972\nAnd we have to know that,\nthat synchronizes the service in multiple\n\n491\n00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:40.188\ndistinct time zones and lets us then\ncome up with a way of saying okay,\n\n492\n00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:43.404\nthis offset from this base\ngives us localized time.\n\n493\n00:24:43.404 --> 00:24:46.285\nAnd therefore we can do that,\nbut coordinate that back.\n\n494\n00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:47.475\nSo, we calculate UTC,\n\n495\n00:24:47.475 --> 00:24:51.985\nwe use an offset value for the system\nclock with the system time zone.\n\n496\n00:24:51.985 --> 00:24:58.440\nSo, for instance, here, I think I put this\nlittle example in the show notes for you.\n\n497\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.929\nIf you're in military time,\nif you think about a 24 cycle,\n\n498\n00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:06.157\nwhich is how the system sees time and\ntherefore is understanding it, if you\n\n499\n00:25:06.157 --> 00:25:11.551\nthink about 00:00 being at the top of the\nclock, in other words, at 24:00, right?\n\n500\n00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:14.333\nIf you take away eight hours, let's say,\n\n501\n00:25:14.333 --> 00:25:18.892\nbecause we're gonna be at UTC -08 or\nour time offset is UTC -08,\n\n502\n00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:24.477\nthe first log entries should appear\nat 24-8, or roughly, 16:00, right?\n\n503\n00:25:24.477 --> 00:25:28.297\nIf we back off that, and then we\nshould be able to go from there, and\n\n504\n00:25:28.297 --> 00:25:32.666\nif we see disparate time zone information\nor disparate offsets in the logs,\n\n505\n00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:37.134\nknowing what that is, so yeah,\nwe're in this time zone, it should be -5.\n\n506\n00:25:37.134 --> 00:25:42.014\nAnd then we look and we don't see that,\nthat logging starts at 19:00 hours,\n\n507\n00:25:42.014 --> 00:25:46.679\nwhich would be 19 + 5 = 24, but\nrather, starts at, I don't know,\n\n508\n00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:48.740\n03 or something like that.\n\n509\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.416\nSo 03:00,\n\n510\n00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:52.425\nwe would see that there's definitely\nbeen some funny business going on.\n\n511\n00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:55.624\nAnd so we wanna be thinking about\nthat because knowledge of logs,\n\n512\n00:25:55.624 --> 00:25:59.200\nlog file formats, offsets,\nreally important for us to consider.\n\n513\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.775\nAn IIS has an owner's manual,\n\n514\n00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:04.940\nright, for logging just like Apache does,\njust like any web server does.\n\n515\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.200\nIt'd be important for you to go in and\ntake a look at some of that.\n\n516\n00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.600\nWhat are the elements of the Apache Core\nweb server functionality?\n\n517\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.380\nThere are five, if you give me just one\nsecond, I will bring them up for you.\n\n518\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.199\nShow you what they are, magic,\nclose your eyes, don't look, don't peek,\n\n519\n00:26:19.199 --> 00:26:21.032\nclose your eyes, you can't see the magic.\n\n520\n00:26:21.032 --> 00:26:23.250\nAnd as soon as I do that,\nI'm gonna bring it back up.\n\n521\n00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.380\nNo, I'm only kidding, you can watch, I'm\njust scrolling down [LAUGH] just to see.\n\n522\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.695\nAll right, so yeah, let's go full screen.\n\n523\n00:26:28.695 --> 00:26:31.710\nLike there was really something magic that\nwas gonna happen that I was gonna do.\n\n524\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.070\nWe're just gonna conjure a spell.\n\n525\n00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.383\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Make them appear.\n\n526\n00:26:34.383 --> 00:26:36.811\nIt'd be cool if I did that in invisible\nink, and I had to click a button.\n\n527\n00:26:36.811 --> 00:26:37.411\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be cool.\n\n528\n00:26:37.411 --> 00:26:38.466\n&gt;&gt; But then again, on the Mac [CROSSTALK].\n\n529\n00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:39.932\n&gt;&gt; You could done have\ndone it stenographically.\n\n530\n00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:41.934\n&gt;&gt; I could have done it stenographically.\n\n531\n00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.179\nYeah, you say that, I can't say that.\n\n532\n00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:46.130\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's go back to full screen.\n\n533\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.980\nSo what are the elements of the Apache\nCore, meaning what are the elements that\n\n534\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:55.570\nmake up the Apache web services,\nhttp_protocol, _main, _request,\n\n535\n00:26:55.570 --> 00:27:00.288\nAlloc or alloc, all lock,\nI guess, .c, either way.\n\n536\n00:27:00.288 --> 00:27:04.899\nhttp_config, these are the common\ncore elements files capabilities that\n\n537\n00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:05.700\nwe think of.\n\n538\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.059\nSo wanna just have a sense of this, again,\nif you're planning on taking the exam.\n\n539\n00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:11.042\nBeing able to do a little compare and\n\n540\n00:27:11.042 --> 00:27:15.208\ncontrast between the two major web\nserver platforms, IIS versus Apache,\n\n541\n00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:18.664\nMicrosoft versus Linux,\nin other words, would be helpful.\n\n542\n00:27:18.664 --> 00:27:21.777\n_protocol manages the routines\nthat are acting with clients,\n\n543\n00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:24.900\ntaking care of all the data exchange,\nand socket connections.\n\n544\n00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.700\nIn other words, this is how we manage\nour protocols that connect and\n\n545\n00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.570\nexchange information.\n\n546\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.916\nIf you think about the logic of that,\nhopefully that makes sense.\n\n547\n00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:35.815\nhttp_main, the actual server startups and\ntimeouts, this is the management of\n\n548\n00:27:35.815 --> 00:27:39.720\nthe connections inbound and\noutbound and the configuration that\n\n549\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.554\nis going to be done through the config,\nthat then gets applied to run the server.\n\n550\n00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:47.911\nSo the server start ups properly and\nis able to maintain a queue for\n\n551\n00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:51.767\nx number of minutes before it times out,\nthings like that, are done here.\n\n552\n00:27:51.767 --> 00:27:55.811\nhttp_request controls the step by step\nprocedures involved between various\n\n553\n00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:56.590\nmodules.\n\n554\n00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.900\nModules are programmatic elements\nthat provide functionality, right?\n\n555\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.141\nSo think of them that way,\nto complete a client request and\n\n556\n00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:03.896\nit's also responsible for error handling.\n\n557\n00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.633\nVery important for us to know that.\n\n558\n00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:10.371\nOne of the forensically important places\nwe may go and start looking for evidence\n\n559\n00:28:10.371 --> 00:28:15.050\nof wrongdoing and monkey business will\nbe logs associated with HTTP requests.\n\n560\n00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.078\nBecause that's where we'll see errors, and\n\n561\n00:28:17.078 --> 00:28:20.460\nwe may see things that would help us\nto better understand what's happening.\n\n562\n00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.082\nAlloc.c or Alloc.c handles\nthe allocation of the resource pools.\n\n563\n00:28:26.082 --> 00:28:28.918\nThis is where we actually configure and\nallocate out resources.\n\n564\n00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:33.394\nSo, if we're not gonna be, or rather,\nif we are gonna be manipulating\n\n565\n00:28:33.394 --> 00:28:36.902\nresource availability through DOS or\nDDOS solutions,\n\n566\n00:28:36.902 --> 00:28:41.022\nthen this may be one of the targets\nthat a bad actor would look for.\n\n567\n00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:45.274\nAnd then the config, well, that, hopefully\npretty obviously, deals with the actual\n\n568\n00:28:45.274 --> 00:28:49.490\nnuts and bolts, the settings associated\nwith the config file or files, right?\n\n569\n00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.121\nIn many cases, so this is gonna allow\nus to arrange all the modules, all\n\n570\n00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:57.434\nthe programmatic functionality that are\ngonna be necessary for request handling.\n\n571\n00:28:57.434 --> 00:29:01.001\nHow they're gonna be structured,\nhow they communicate, when they execute,\n\n572\n00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:04.463\nwhen they're available, all the stuff\nthat goes into just gift wrapping and\n\n573\n00:29:04.463 --> 00:29:07.730\nproviding that functionality,\ntop to bottom, is gonna be done there.\n\n574\n00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.522\nSo, when we put together all\nthe different Apache core elements,\n\n575\n00:29:11.522 --> 00:29:13.090\nwe have the Apache Server.\n\n576\n00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.218\nIf you're asked at some point,\nperhaps in the future, hey,\n\n577\n00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:19.390\nof the listed items,\nwhich ones make up the Apache core?\n\n578\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.300\nThese are the five you'd wanna focus on,\nright?\n\n579\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.884\nVery important to have knowledge of that.\n\n580\n00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:25.958\nYeah, I'm done.\n\n581\n00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:26.515\n&gt;&gt; You're done?\n\n582\n00:29:26.515 --> 00:29:28.075\n&gt;&gt; Well for this, that was what I got.\n\n583\n00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:29.779\n&gt;&gt; You dropped me like a bad transmission.\n\n584\n00:29:29.779 --> 00:29:32.612\n&gt;&gt; I did, I thought you were gonna\nbe there to catch that ball.\n\n585\n00:29:32.612 --> 00:29:34.835\n[LAUGH] No,\nwe are done with this [CROSSTALK]\n\n586\n00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:35.381\n&gt;&gt; I was so\n\n587\n00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:39.075\nenamored looking at Apache cuz-\n&gt;&gt; You were Apache-eyed.\n\n588\n00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:42.622\n&gt;&gt; I was actually, I was looking at my\nApache logs going this is good stuff,\n\n589\n00:29:42.622 --> 00:29:44.800\nI wanna take a look at this.\n\n590\n00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.727\nHe caught me watching the show-\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n591\n00:29:46.727 --> 00:29:47.887\n&gt;&gt; While I'm on the show.\n[LAUGH]\n\n592\n00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:49.195\n&gt;&gt; But all fairness to Daniel,\n\n593\n00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:52.695\nall fairness to Daniel, we are done\nwith that particular piece, because-\n\n594\n00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:54.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have more.\n\n595\n00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:57.578\n&gt;&gt; We do have some more, specifically with\nthe Apache log overview that I wanna do.\n\n596\n00:29:57.578 --> 00:29:59.761\nBut probably not enough time in two\nminutes to squeeze that in, so.\n\n597\n00:29:59.761 --> 00:30:00.739\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, no, no, no problem.\n\n598\n00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm thinking we should\njust come back, do another show.\n\n599\n00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.570\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem,\nI say we do that very thing myself.\n\n600\n00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.940\nHow about you good folks out there?\n\n601\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.633\nYou mind joining us for\none more, when it comes to-\n\n602\n00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:08.893\n&gt;&gt; I didn't promise one more only,\n\n603\n00:30:08.893 --> 00:30:10.746\nmaybe more than one-\n&gt;&gt; But at least one, right,\n\n604\n00:30:10.746 --> 00:30:12.490\nwe'll say that, at least one.\n\n605\n00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.365\nAll right, everyone,\nthanks for watching this one.\n\n606\n00:30:14.365 --> 00:30:17.178\nDefinitely come back, we do have\nanother one on the books for you, so\n\n607\n00:30:17.178 --> 00:30:18.060\ncome check that out.\n\n608\n00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.979\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n609\n00:30:22.082 --> 00:30:23.387\n&gt;&gt; That's me, I'm sorry, you caught me.\n\n610\n00:30:23.387 --> 00:30:24.059\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I caught him.\n\n611\n00:30:24.059 -->

time.\n\n614\n00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:31.007\n&gt;&gt; And we'll be back to talk\nabout that in just a minute.\n\n615\n00:30:31.007 --> 00:30:36.867\n[MUSIC]\n\n616\n00:30:36.867 -->

All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.710\nAll right.\nGreetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.710\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.810\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.970\n&gt;&gt; IT hands.\n&gt;&gt; And in today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.740\nthat's right we will have IT hands for\nour [LAUGH] CHFI v9 series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.470\nThe IT hands joining us today\nare attached to a one Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.325\nAdam, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:31.636\n[LAUGH] There's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n13\n00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.970\n&gt;&gt; It would be great if I could\ncommunicate just with these,\n\n14\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.650\nlike a certain [INAUDIBLE].\n\n15\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.160\n&gt;&gt; It's called American Sign Language.\n\n16\n00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.765\n&gt;&gt; When they're not shaking [INAUDIBLE].\n\n17\n00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:39.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But not the shaking of the hands.\n\n18\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.950\nThat's not part of sign language.\n\n19\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.380\nSo, we're gonna continue\nour conversations.\n\n20\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.050\nWe are going to wrap up actually.\n\n21\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.100\nAnd, we'll have to do so\nin a relatively short order here.\n\n22\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.210\nWe don't have too much left, but we had\njust enough that it was worth carving out\n\n23\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.060\na few extra minutes in another\nshow to finish up you.\n\n24\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.570\nWanna go back in,\ncontinue our conversations here.\n\n25\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.790\nWe were talking about logging.\n\n26\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410\nDid a quick overview of IIS versus Apache.\n\n27\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.830\nWanted to drill down on\nthe Apache side a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.070\nTalk about common Apache log formats.\n\n29\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.230\nThe default location of error\nlogs I mentioned that Daniel and\n\n30\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.750\nI had an interesting conversation\noff line between our episodes here\n\n31\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.470\njust about a thought he was having.\n\n32\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.630\nIf you remember we had that momentary\nlapse of attention, the end of our last\n\n33\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.950\nepisode for both of us and-\n&gt;&gt; Leave that part out!\n\n34\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, part of that is.\n\n35\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.019\nI mean, actually you should\nprobably narrate real quick and\n\n36\n00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:24.625\ntell the kind folk out there\nwhat you were thinking.\n\n37\n00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:25.825\nI think it's actually a really\ninteresting thing [CROSSTALK]\n\n38\n00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:26.426\n&gt;&gt; It is interesting.\n\n39\n00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:30.578\nSo we were talking about different\nHTTP servers that are available.\n\n40\n00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:36.250\nObviously we're hitting the big dogs here\nwith IIS and Apache, nginx is another one.\n\n41\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.730\nBut I typically will start up\n\n42\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.710\na simple HTTP service using Python which\nis a built in module inside of Python.\n\n43\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.700\nSo whatever directory that I'm\ncurrently in I can make my web root and\n\n44\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.460\nstart sharing files.\n\n45\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.900\nSo if I wrote a script or\nsomething in a directory somewhere I could\n\n46\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.030\njust start Python as a HTTP server and\nI could serve those up.\n\n47\n00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.840\nWhen people make connections or\na script runs and it makes a contact.\n\n48\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.849\nYes, I invite them to make connections\nto my [CROSSTALK] rogue web server to\n\n49\n00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.088\ndownload something.\n\n50\n00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:10.653\nThose connections show up in my terminal,\n\n51\n00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:14.644\nI was thinking about ways that I\ncould actually make a log file out of\n\n52\n00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:19.800\nthat by redirecting that output somewhere,\nso it could be more easily parsable.\n\n53\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.180\nAnd as well as make it\nviewable to the console still.\n\n54\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.260\nSo it's just an interesting thought\nwe're having as part of the show as he\n\n55\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.870\nmade me think it [LAUGH]\nDuring that episode.\n\n56\n00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.050\nIt was a lot of fun for us to go down but\nyou can see things like that.\n\n57\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.880\nThat wouldn't be\na standardized type format.\n\n58\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.218\nSo who knows maybe a bad\nactor gets into a system,\n\n59\n00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:45.512\nfires up a Python HTTP server, and\nstarts dishing out bad code or something,\n\n60\n00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:50.254\nmalicious code somewhere search\nusing as a repository or platform.\n\n61\n00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:54.210\nWhere we find those log files is\nthe system logging that somewhere?\n\n62\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.970\nWho knows, maybe we could find that stuff.\n\n63\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo it was a very interesting conversation.\n\n64\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As Daniel shared that idea with me\n\n65\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.640\nwe just went back and forth for a couple\nminutes about well, we could do this or\n\n66\n00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.350\nredirect the output, create a file,\ncould parse the file, look at it.\n\n67\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.660\nThere's different things you could do.\n\n68\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.398\nAnd so it's just that kind\nof thought process, right,\n\n69\n00:03:11.398 --> 00:03:13.792\nthat is part of the desire, right?\n\n70\n00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.912\nThat we have behind the scenes as\ninvestigators to always be thinking,\n\n71\n00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:18.992\nalways beyond the opportunity\nto hunt there for\n\n72\n00:03:18.992 --> 00:03:20.990\nways that we can uncover information.\n\n73\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.810\nAnd look for\nthe unobvious as we often talk about so\n\n74\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.550\nthat way we can expose that behavior\nthat may be problematic for us.\n\n75\n00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.832\nTo that end as Daniel\ncalled it the big dog.\n\n76\n00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Right. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So Apache logs\nlet's take a look at the log format,\n\n77\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.460\nthis is something we oughta put up\non the screen, a little bit hard for\n\n78\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.570\nme to throw all these terms out.\n\n79\n00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.180\n&gt;&gt; When we say big dog\nthis is the big dog right?\n\n80\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.130\nLike as far as web servers go.\n\n81\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.460\nWhat is this,\nlike 80% market share or something?\n\n82\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.040\nIt's huge.\n\n83\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.310\n&gt;&gt; This is like Microsoft has the desktop,\nclearly, the enterprise from\n\n84\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.170\nthe productivity standpoint, they have\nthat space that's essentially theirs.\n\n85\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.250\nThis is, without a doubt, hands down,\nweb hosting far and away.\n\n86\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.300\nLike by factors, orders of magnitude,\ndone on Apache versus any other platform,\n\n87\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.900\nregardless of what it is,\nthat is the king.\n\n88\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.050\nThe big dog as they say, woof woof.\n\n89\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Basically running the Internet.\n\n90\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Running the Internet as they say yes,\nrunning the Internet.\n\n91\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.627\nSo knowledge of incident response and\n\n92\n00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:18.124\ntherefore as a result certainly forensic\ninvestigation of things is common and\n\n93\n00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.755\nstraight forward as\nApache Log file formats.\n\n94\n00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.680\nWhat you can see there we're gonna go full\nscreen, so you can take a look at that.\n\n95\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.624\nIs gonna be critical to our ability to be\nsuccessful in the digital forensic space\n\n96\n00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:31.695\ncuz we don't understand the commonality\nof the log file format and what's there.\n\n97\n00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:34.455\nHow are we gonna possibly\ninterpret what we're seeing?\n\n98\n00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:38.475\nThink about that so you could see here\nthat we do have some interesting things.\n\n99\n00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:41.990\nI mentioned this in one of the earlier\nepisodes, we have some place holder,\n\n100\n00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.320\nkind of values that we're\ngonna have to interpret.\n\n101\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.195\nPercentage, kinda did this.\n\n102\n00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:49.740\nI wrote them up here and then I put them\ndown in order so you could see them.\n\n103\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.710\nPercentage represents\na client's IP address, right?\n\n104\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.645\nPercent %L represents the remote log name.\n\n105\n00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:59.705\nSo this returns, as I point out here,\na dash unless mod_ident is presented.\n\n106\n00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:03.315\nAnd identity check has been set On,\nmeaning we're actually querying for and\n\n107\n00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:06.545\ngetting the identity checks that\nwe're doing, authentication and\n\n108\n00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:07.795\nverification of the identity.\n\n109\n00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:10.605\nOtherwise, we're going\nto see no knowledge.\n\n110\n00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:12.020\nSo dash essentially, right.\n\n111\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.960\n%U the client ID.\n\n112\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.170\nRepresent t the time server was\nactually getting the request inbound,\n\n113\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.710\nthat's our timestamp for\ninbound request, very important.\n\n114\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.595\nAnd we do need to know\nthat that format would be\n\n115\n00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:27.510\nday/month/year:hour:minute:second zone.\n\n116\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.250\nAnd I laid that out for you here so\nyou can see that as well.\n\n117\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.450\nAgain, knowledge of that will be valuable\ncertainly in the real world want to apply\n\n118\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.870\nthis forensics knowledge this\nunderstanding of the information we\n\n119\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.950\nare examining.\n\n120\n00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.200\nBut also, I'm thinking perhaps for\n\n121\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.190\nthe exam, wouldn't be bad to have\na sense of something like that.\n\n122\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.758\nYou may get three or four at least I\ncould see, if I was asking the questions.\n\n123\n00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:54.098\nYou may get three or four different\nopportunities to scramble this particular\n\n124\n00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:58.306\nstring right here and say, okay,\nwhat would be the appropriate time format\n\n125\n00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:03.385\ndisplay, in Apache weblog, is it\nday/month/year: hour:minute:second zone?\n\n126\n00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:07.451\nIs it is a month/day/year, cuz we have\n[CROSSTALK] international versus what we\n\n127\n00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.159\nmay be used to depending on\nwhere you are in the world.\n\n128\n00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.565\nIs it gonna be hours/minutes/seconds?\n\n129\n00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:14.005\nMakes sense when we see it but\n\n130\n00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:19.630\nto the stress of the exam who knows what\nyou choose you're not paying attention.\n\n131\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.404\nSo you gotta think about that or\nyou may put in zone before any of that,\n\n132\n00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:25.241\nyou may put zone on the front end.\n\n133\n00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:27.440\nI can think of all these\nways to scramble that right?\n\n134\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.450\nSo keep that in mind, all right so\nthen we'll go back if we could.\n\n135\n00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:35.250\n%R in quotes there, as you can see.\n\n136\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.470\nWith the directory slash on either side.\n\n137\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.447\nMethod used for a request-response\nbetween the client and server.\n\n138\n00:06:40.447 --> 00:06:44.600\nIt was in the get, so we're doing\nthe source requested by the client.\n\n139\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.720\nAnd the protocol used.\n\n140\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.700\nWe're gonna get all that information.\n\n141\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.735\nSo wanna see that.\n\n142\n00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:51.826\n%s, or rather excuse me, not %s.\n\n143\n00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:53.886\n%, what do we call that\n[CROSSTALK] less than greater.\n\n144\n00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Like caret.\n\n145\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Caret right.\n\n146\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.020\n&gt;&gt; No, not a caret.\n\n147\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.330\nCaret, that's greater than.\n\n148\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.940\n&gt;&gt; That's great than.\n\n149\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.440\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.490\nGreater than to the right,\n\n151\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.320\nless than to the left.\n\n152\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.900\nRight?\nYeah so.\n\n153\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.190\n%&gt;s the status code\n\n154\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.790\nthe server sends back to the client.\n\n155\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.059\nObviously important,\ncuz we get to interpret things about that.\n\n156\n00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:10.800\nAnd %b lowercase, Bravo, right?\n\n157\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.530\nRepresents the size of the object\nwhich the server sends to the client.\n\n158\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.570\nAgain, that would be\nreally important to know.\n\n159\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.620\nWe're serving up a two kilobyte\nfile versus a two megabyte file,\n\n160\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.710\nthat would be important to know.\n\n161\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.410\nBecause obviously chances are good\n\n162\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.070\nthat we're gonna be having certain\nparameters we wanna be examining.\n\n163\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.550\nAnd really, really large files\nmay set off alarm bells.\n\n164\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.110\nBut remember, we don't need a lot of space\nto do a lot of damage as we talked about.\n\n165\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.220\nI mean a basic SQL query that\ncan be sent through to execute\n\n166\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.750\nan injection may be 20,\n30 characters and that's it.\n\n167\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.710\nIt doesn't have to be very\nmuch to do the basics.\n\n168\n00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.510\nSo we've established the fact that it's\nnot necessarily that there's a direct\n\n169\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.010\ncorrelation between the larger, the size\nof the download, the more damage we do.\n\n170\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.930\nIt's just that there may be more\nopportunity to hide things and\n\n171\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.820\ntherefore more space that we can leverage\nfrom a steganography perspective and\n\n172\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.910\nall sorts of other stuff there.\n\n173\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.510\nSo you want to keep that in mind.\n\n174\n00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.600\nAlso, have some default location\nof error logs that we want to\n\n175\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.240\nbe able to take a look at here,\nwe can see these up on the screen.\n\n176\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.990\nSo for Red Hat,\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, Cent OS,\n\n177\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.080\nFedora in general,\nany of those kind of Linux.\n\n178\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.750\nVarieties that are listed there,\nvar/log/httpd for\n\n179\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.528\nwriter daemon,\nerror_log is where we'll be looking.\n\n180\n00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:29.881\nDebian/Ubuntu var/log/apache2/error.log.\n\n181\n00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:34.260\nFreeBSD, I always wanna throw that Unix in\nthere cuz it's always important to know,\n\n182\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.295\nvar/log/httpd-error.log.\n\n183\n00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:39.165\nSo you can see there\nare some slight variations.\n\n184\n00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:43.985\nVar log is pretty much the standard\nstarting jumping in point for everything.\n\n185\n00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:47.065\nBut below that, we see some differences.\n\n186\n00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:49.745\nHttpd for the Debian, Apache II,\n\n187\n00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:55.600\nAndroid httpd-error just directly as\nthe log file name without a sub directory.\n\n188\n00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.864\nSo there's variables there,\nyou wanna be aware of that.\n\n189\n00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:02.779\nDefault location for access logs, so\nlet's just scroll this up here so\n\n190\n00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:03.940\nwe can see this.\n\n191\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.285\nAgain, why would we look at access longs?\n\n192\n00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:08.240\nWell that's half of the equation right?\n\n193\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.300\nError logs tell us what went wrong,\n\n194\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.970\naccess logs tell us who was\ncausing it in the first place.\n\n195\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.490\nWanna know that, if we don't know that,\n\n196\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.010\nwe really don't have a lot\nof information to go on.\n\n197\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.380\nSo again, RHEL Red Hat Enterprise,\nRed Hat overall, CentOS/Fedora.\n\n198\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.890\nWe're gonna see there var/log/http\ninstead of error log, access_log.\n\n199\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.552\nSame path, but you'll see and that\nshould be like that by the way, right,\n\n200\n00:09:32.552 --> 00:09:34.037\nhttpd/access.log.\n\n201\n00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:36.699\nJust substitute the word access for\nerror and\n\n202\n00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:39.680\nwe're getting the same information there.\n\n203\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.310\nI had a typo in mine, I don't know\nif you caught it, just in the notes.\n\n204\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.243\nIt was there with a space, I don't\nknow if in the notes it is like that.\n\n205\n00:09:46.243 --> 00:09:50.091\nSo I'm just gonna ask Daniel\nto make sure that I have that,\n\n206\n00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:51.590\nthere was a space-\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n207\n00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.250\n&gt;&gt; I corrected in real time here.\n\n208\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.530\nI'm just reminding you just to\nnote it in case it got past\n\n209\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.012\nour QA process guy in the show notes.\n\n210\n00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:00.403\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the QA process but\n\n211\n00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:01.410\nI left it in there.\n\n212\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.780\nI didn't catch it so it's probably in\nthe so make sure that gets fixed up for\n\n213\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.610\nyou before the notes get posted.\n\n214\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.440\nAnd checking the following locations for\n\n215\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.980\nApache config files to make sure we\nknow where those log files will be.\n\n216\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.900\nDaniel made an interesting reference\nin the beginning which why I had him\n\n217\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.380\nexplain that thought process\nhe'd been going through.\n\n218\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.610\nBecause he said essentially,\nhey you know what I can go in in theory.\n\n219\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.720\nI don't know where that output is.\n\n220\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.090\nMaybe there are logs maybe there are not.\n\n221\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.860\nWe don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n222\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.750\n&gt;&gt; We agree we're not sure.\n\n223\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.740\nBut even if there are where would they be?\n\n224\n00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.730\nWell not sure.\n\n225\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.270\nWe'd have to go look at the config\nfile to figure that out.\n\n226\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.730\nBut if we wanna modify that output.\n\n227\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.080\nOne way to do that would be to look in\nthe config file, figure out where the log\n\n228\n00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.260\nfiles are, and then we could go\nmodify that directory or that path.\n\n229\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.730\nAnd so knowing where to look to see\nthe authoritative directory and\n\n230\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.040\nmake sure it has not been moved or\n\n231\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.250\nmodified would also be valuable\ninformation for the investigator.\n\n232\n00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.950\nAnd we do that here as you can see,\nagain, same order, same OS's, right?\n\n233\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:11:00.112\nUser, usr short for user,\nuser/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf file.\n\n234\n00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:05.544\nVersus the Debian/Ubuntu, which would\nbe the Apache2 conf versus FreeBSD.\n\n235\n00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:10.332\nWhich would again be the httpd.con file\nbut in a different set of directories,\n\n236\n00:11:10.332 --> 00:11:14.010\netc/httpd/conf is where we'd find it for\nFreeBSD.\n\n237\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.610\nSo, again, we wanna know those paths.\n\n238\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.980\nNow, let's be realistic here.\n\n239\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.770\nAre you gonna remember all those paths?\n\n240\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.610\nJust join me in the chant and\nsay absolutely not,\n\n241\n00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.220\nbecause you're lying if you say you will.\n\n242\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.320\nBut if you work with one of\nthese systems regularly, sure,\n\n243\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.530\nyou know where they are, absolutely.\n\n244\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.680\n&gt;&gt; You'll definitely know that,\nabsolutely.\n\n245\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.520\n&gt;&gt; But the reality is if you\ndon't work with them regularly,\n\n246\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.440\nyou're not gonna know, just go do\nwhat the rest of the world does,\n\n247\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.350\nyou go look them up.\n\n248\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.190\nWhen you to know and then you forget\nabout them until you need them again.\n\n249\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.602\nThere's nothing wrong with that but\n\n250\n00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:39.241\nI'm just pointing out to you that\nwe're putting them there for you,\n\n251\n00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:42.312\ngoing over them with you, making sure you\nknow where they are and what they are.\n\n252\n00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:45.884\nBecause clearly, there maybe some\nimportance here when you're being asked to\n\n253\n00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:49.295\nanswer questions at some point to validate\nthat you would know where to go and\n\n254\n00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:51.480\nshow that you have some knowledge of that.\n\n255\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.740\nBut then in the real world,\nremember these things,\n\n256\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.130\nnot that they change all that often, those\npaths have been pretty consistent for\n\n257\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.260\nmost generations and\nmost revisions of those OSs.\n\n258\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.070\nBut could they modify over time?\n\n259\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:02.680\nAbsolutely.\n\n260\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.760\nIf you're looking at this episode, a day,\na week, a month, a year, a generation.\n\n261\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.338\nIn the future,\nwho knows how long it will be out there?\n\n262\n00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:10.710\nWouldn't it be cool if\nour episodes went viral?\n\n263\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.600\n&gt;&gt; That would be cool.\n\n264\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.742\n&gt;&gt; And we could [INAUDIBLE] that,\n\n265\n00:12:12.742 --> 00:12:14.770\n[INAUDIBLE] like the max\nhead room of the IT space.\n\n266\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.710\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n267\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.367\n&gt;&gt; Most people out there [INAUDIBLE] cool.\n\n268\n00:12:17.367 --> 00:12:18.110\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Listening to us.\n\n269\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Well the cool thing to your\npoint is life is an open book test.\n\n270\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.690\nIt's not an exam we go sit for\nin a booth life we do for the CHFI.\n\n271\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.340\n&gt;&gt; Or CEH.\n\n272\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Or CEH or any other exam, right?\n\n273\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.090\nIn real world land you get to actually go\nokay actually let me find out about that.\n\n274\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.710\nAnd figure out what the problem is.\n\n275\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.730\n&gt;&gt; But you have to be smart enough\nto look it up to know what the most\n\n276\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.160\nrecent iteration of that is,\nwhich is the other point I was gonna make,\n\n277\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.080\nwhich is you gotta know.\n\n278\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.040\n&gt;&gt; You just gotta make flashcards.\n\n279\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Well you gotta make flashcards\nto study, that's important.\n\n280\n00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.380\nBut I was just gonna point out that we\nput the information up on the screen,\n\n281\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.090\nwe talk to it, talk about it,\nwe show it to you in many respects and\n\n282\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.640\ncertainly go through it,\nput it in the show notes.\n\n283\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.720\nAll that's important.\n\n284\n00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.790\nBut keep in mind,\n\n285\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.030\nwe can not guarantee that that will\nbe the gospel going forward forever.\n\n286\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.870\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's quite possible\n\n287\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.560\nthat a vendor may decide to modify one\nof those past statements overtime.\n\n288\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.880\nAnd indeed very probable that they would.\n\n289\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.495\nI'm not suggesting it will happen, but\n\n290\n00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.555\nI'm pointing out that it's very\nlikely that over time it would.\n\n291\n00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:12.025\nWe want you to be smart enough to know\nthat you should always look that stuff up\n\n292\n00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.615\nand get the most recent information.\n\n293\n00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:16.885\nBut there's nothing wrong with starting\nwith the assumption that it may be where\n\n294\n00:13:16.885 --> 00:13:18.515\nit was the last time you checked.\n\n295\n00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:20.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But then if it's not there, go out and\n\n296\n00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:21.605\nfigure out where it is, right?\n\n297\n00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:23.098\nThat's going to be important.\n\n298\n00:13:23.098 --> 00:13:23.885\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, very good.\n\n299\n00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:27.180\nWe finally wrapped up this domain, we hope\nyou guys have gotten a lot out of this.\n\n300\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.938\nThis has probably been the most fun\ndomain I've had doing with you so far,\n\n301\n00:13:29.938 --> 00:13:31.821\nAdam I really enjoyed this so\nI thank you for that,\n\n302\n00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:32.770\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n303\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.318\n&gt;&gt; Thank you all good folks for watching,\nbut join us back we'll definitely have\n\n304\n00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:38.860\nsome more content coming for\nyou in different domains.\n\n305\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.250\nBut signing off for\nITPROTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n306\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.249\n&gt;&gt; I'm http.com.\n\n307\n00:13:44.249 --> 00:13:46.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n308\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.957\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody\n\n309\n00:13:47.957 --> 00:13:54.614\n[MUSIC]\n\n310\n00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:56.774\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:10.521\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.953\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:16.039\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.679\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.680\nwe're continuing on with\nmore on our CHFI v9 series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.120\nAnd of course, joining us back in the\nsaddle, our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.910\nAdam, glad to have you back, man.\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.363\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, glad to be back, cuz I was\ngonna say, you can call me Mr. Database.\n\n11\n00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.352\n&gt;&gt; That's true, man.\n\n12\n00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:34.741\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what we're gonna talk\nabout this particular go-around,\n\n13\n00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.410\nwe're gonna focus on database forensics.\n\n14\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.830\nYet another area where we need to\nspend some time, some attention,\n\n15\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.357\napply some thought process\nto our capabilities.\n\n16\n00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:47.959\nAnd our necessary requirements,\ntry that in a better, more friendly way.\n\n17\n00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.272\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Our necessities that we have to pay\n\n18\n00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:50.944\nattention to,\n\n19\n00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:54.330\nfrom a requirements perspective,\nwith regards to investigation.\n\n20\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.430\nWhen we are thinking about all the other\nareas we've talked about up until now, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.500\nall the other knowledge areas that will\ncome after this set of episodes and shows.\n\n22\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.320\nWe've thought about how to investigate web\nattacks already, talked about network and\n\n23\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.015\noperating system forensics.\n\n24\n00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.594\nTalked about the overall investigative\nprocess, and what that would look like.\n\n25\n00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:14.879\nGot some upcoming conversations\nabout cloud forensics,\n\n26\n00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:19.346\nmalware forensics,\nemail forensics, mobile forensics.\n\n27\n00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:23.508\nA lot of areas still to go, but\nwe've already talked about a lot of stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:25.860\nYet every one of those\nareas I just mentioned, or\n\n29\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.250\nwe have talked about, one way or another,\nwinds up at the doorstep of this topic.\n\n30\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.850\nWhich is when we go to actually\nexamine all of the data\n\n31\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.930\nthat we keep talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.560\nThe order of volatility,\nif you remember, for data, right?\n\n33\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.230\nStart with registers, caches,\ndynamic memory areas,\n\n34\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.860\nend up with static data that's\nstored in archival storage.\n\n35\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.060\nEverything, without exception,\nresides somewhere,\n\n36\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.590\na lot of that data is residing in what\nwe would think commonly of as databases.\n\n37\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.194\nOne or more distinct locations with\nsome sort of program structuring data,\n\n38\n00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:00.856\nprobably relational more often than not,\nthese days.\n\n39\n00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:05.644\nThe databases themselves form repositories\nfor lots of our business data,\n\n40\n00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:11.020\nlots of our personal data, there are many,\nmany things that will wind up there.\n\n41\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.630\nAnd we have to have a sense of\nhow to approach those systems,\n\n42\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.469\nhow to interact with them forensically.\n\n43\n00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.380\nWhat are the do's and don'ts,\nwhat are the requirements?\n\n44\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.470\nWhat are the key players, who are the big\nvendors in the database space?\n\n45\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.340\nCertainly Microsoft comes to mind,\ntheir MS SQL, Microsoft SQL product.\n\n46\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.293\nOpen SQL products, Postgres, and\ndifferent structure query language\n\n47\n00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:37.130\ndatabases of a variety of types,\npop up and should be on our radar.\n\n48\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.670\nAnd so we're gonna have to interact with\nthem, understand the structure of data,\n\n49\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.070\nunderstand the tables\nthe data may live in.\n\n50\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.642\nUnderstand how we read those tables,\ninteract with them, see them,\n\n51\n00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:47.481\nwhat that looks like.\n\n52\n00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.764\nAnd we have to really be thinking about\nthat thought process as we get started.\n\n53\n00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:53.956\nBecause we have to understand the types\nof files and the structure that we\n\n54\n00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:57.269\nare gonna encounter, in order to figure\nabout how to safeguard that data.\n\n55\n00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.821\nExamine it forensically, but\nalso make sure we don't miss anything,\n\n56\n00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.600\nwe don't leave data behind.\n\n57\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.290\nFor instance, when we go to look for\ndata in the system,\n\n58\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.520\nwe may have account databases.\n\n59\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.500\nWe may have the ability to understand, and\nthink through the logic of there being\n\n60\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.220\na synchronized, or some sort of synched\ndatabase, maybe a certificates database.\n\n61\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.070\nMaybe there is a contacts database, a list\nof contacts that we would want to see.\n\n62\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.820\nThere's all sorts of stuff that\ncan go into databases, and\n\n63\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.940\nwe have to think about that.\n\n64\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.162\nSo jumping in the beginning\nof our conversations there,\n\n65\n00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:31.700\nis where we're gonna spend some time.\n\n66\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.156\nMicrosoft as the provider of SQL,\ntheir flagship database product.\n\n67\n00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:41.277\nProbably, certainly one of the very\ncommon databases we would see on\n\n68\n00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:43.240\nthe Enterprise side today.\n\n69\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.260\nWe certainly bump into Oracle,\nwe bump into IBM's DB2, Informix,\n\n70\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.560\nall sorts of databases that are out there.\n\n71\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.510\nBut Microsoft does certainly wind up being\none of the most prevalent ones we will\n\n72\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.690\noften come up against, and\ntherefore have to spend time with.\n\n73\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.730\nThere are three distinct types of files\nthat tend to make up Microsoft SQL\n\n74\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.070\ndatabases, the primary data file,\nthe secondary data files.\n\n75\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.170\nThere may be more than one, they are\noptional, so we may have different ones,\n\n76\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.660\ntypically user-defined.\n\n77\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.860\nAnd they are gonna store user data,\nso we may see one or more of those.\n\n78\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.990\nAnd the transaction logs, as a set\nof files that hold log information.\n\n79\n00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.660\nThose are gonna be the three key\ndefining file types or types of files,\n\n80\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.610\ncategories of files, that we see and\nwe have to investigate.\n\n81\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.866\nSo let's talk about each one for\na minute, primary data file,\n\n82\n00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:31.838\nthat's the start-up information for\nthe database.\n\n83\n00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:36.318\nThis is where we are gonna find all\nthe other information that points to other\n\n84\n00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.723\nfiles in the database.\n\n85\n00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:41.188\nYou can think of this as almost like\nthe map in the configuration file, that\n\n86\n00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:44.985\ntells us how to manage the data, where\nthings are, and how they interact with it.\n\n87\n00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:48.392\nUser data and objects are stored in\nthis file, or in secondary files,\n\n88\n00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:49.856\ndepending on the structure.\n\n89\n00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:57.490\nAnd every database has one primary data\nfile, and the extension is typically .mdf.\n\n90\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.652\nMary Data Frank, right, or\nMary Delta Frank, I suppose, right?\n\n91\n00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:05.307\nSo .mdf will be the extension for\nthe primary data file.\n\n92\n00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:09.829\nAs a forensics investigator, especially\none focused in the Microsoft world, we\n\n93\n00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:14.033\nwould wanna know that, would be important\nthat we go after the right files.\n\n94\n00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.487\nAnd not just scoop up any kind of file,\nbut\n\n95\n00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:20.750\nspecifically certain kinds that\nwill yield information for us.\n\n96\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.221\nSo, .mdf will be the primary\ndata file extension.\n\n97\n00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:27.348\nSecondary data file, as I mentioned,\noptional, user-defined, may or\n\n98\n00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:28.404\nmay not have them.\n\n99\n00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:31.776\nThey're spread across multiple disks,\nwherever we're storing our data, so\n\n100\n00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:33.248\nthey can be in a variety of places.\n\n101\n00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:37.651\nThe extension for this will be .ndf,\n\n102\n00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.747\ndot N as in No, Delta, Frank, so N-D-F.\n\n103\n00:05:42.747 --> 00:05:46.235\nThat will be our secondary data files,\ntypically plural.\n\n104\n00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:50.670\nAnd our transaction log files,\nagain, we will have multiples there.\n\n105\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.979\nThey are used to restore or recover\nthe database, if we have a problem.\n\n106\n00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.496\nEvery item that is going to be entered\ninto the database, every transaction,\n\n107\n00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:01.011\nin other words, that we entertain,\nthat is committed, that is successful,\n\n108\n00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.367\nwill be written into the log.\n\n109\n00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:07.284\nSo we can walk backwards and re-invent\nthat data, or walk forwards and restore,\n\n110\n00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.030\nwhatever we need to do.\n\n111\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.240\nSo we use the log as a validation tool,\nand\n\n112\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.060\nas a mechanism to authoritatively say,\nwhat should be in the database, right.\n\n113\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.270\nThis is our written\nrecord of what's gone on.\n\n114\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.680\nThere must be at least one log file\nper database, may be more than one.\n\n115\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.340\nThe extension for log files, .ldf,\ndot Larry Delta Frank, L-D-F.\n\n116\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.413\n&gt;&gt; Do you think it was coincidental\nthat they did L, M, and N in succession?\n\n117\n00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:34.084\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps.\n\n118\n00:06:34.084 --> 00:06:37.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps, I had not thought of that.\n\n119\n00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:38.201\n&gt;&gt; Or it was there,\nI thought it was interesting.\n\n120\n00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:42.210\n&gt;&gt; I, that is, kudos, sir, kudos.\n\n121\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.576\n&gt;&gt; But a easy way, like a nice\nlittle mnemonic for you to remember.\n\n122\n00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:45.598\n&gt;&gt; But a good way to think about it,\nabsolutely, right?\n\n123\n00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:49.786\n&gt;&gt; L, M and N [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, although M primary, secondary N,\n\n124\n00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:52.062\nI mean you'd have to just\nunderstand the logic,\n\n125\n00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:54.160\nthe fact they don't match up exactly.\n\n126\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.383\nBut yeah, I mean yeah, sure,\nprobably somebody thought of that,\n\n127\n00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:57.329\nI would think, or somehow.\n\n128\n00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:58.460\nM for master data file,\n\n129\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.550\nthat's where I believe where the extension\nactually comes from, the M there.\n\n130\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.259\nI'm not sure secondary,\nwhat that N would represent but-\n\n131\n00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:06.922\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n132\n00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:09.212\n&gt;&gt; Comes after M, I suppose, I don't know.\n\n133\n00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:10.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what I'm saying.\n\n134\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.840\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps that's why it was secondary.\n\n135\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.850\nNot quite sure about the provenance\nof the secondary data file,\n\n136\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.630\nbut I could speak to the first one.\n\n137\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.810\nAnd certainly the log file, L for\nlog, so D-F, data file, so I mean,\n\n138\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.512\nthat kind of makes sense, I suppose.\n\n139\n00:07:22.512 --> 00:07:24.527\nAll right, so anyway-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.389\n&gt;&gt; Just making sure we're thinking about,\n\n141\n00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:27.940\nactually, I remember years ago.\n\n142\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.520\nThis is our random aside, by the way,\nfor our database episode.\n\n143\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.735\nSo, I remember years ago,\nI read a book, I was out at Microsoft,\n\n144\n00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:36.744\nat the campus doing some work.\n\n145\n00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:41.449\nAnd for some reason I wound up in a\nconversation with somebody after a meeting\n\n146\n00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.520\nor something I was going to,\nwhile I was working out there.\n\n147\n00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.902\nAnd I wound up, they're like, yeah,\n\n148\n00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:51.999\nyou've got to read up on all this\ncrazy history and urban myth and lore.\n\n149\n00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:54.833\nAnd there are several books that have been\nwritten over the years, for Disney and\n\n150\n00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:57.430\nall these companies, but there's a few\nout there for Microsoft as well.\n\n151\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.439\nAnd somebody said, you've gotta\nget this book, and I can't for\n\n152\n00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:00.890\nthe life of me remember which one it was.\n\n153\n00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.403\nBut there was like a book that they said,\n\n154\n00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:04.185\nyou gotta read this if\nyou're gonna be on campus.\n\n155\n00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:07.230\nAnd they'll tell you all this great\nstuff and all these secrets and things.\n\n156\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.390\nAnd it just talks about all that\ncrazy stuff like, Access 1.0 was\n\n157\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.610\ncalled this because when they bought\nit from this company they did this.\n\n158\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.360\nAnd all that kinda stuff you never\nknow about, all that back story.\n\n159\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.400\n&gt;&gt; The history of how\nthese things came about.\n\n160\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was actually pretty\nfascinating, it was kinda cool.\n\n161\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.970\n&gt;&gt; I do love stuff like that.\n\n162\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.911\n&gt;&gt; I just don't remember what the for\n\n163\n00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:24.669\nthe life of me, I can't remember\nwhat the name of that book was.\n\n164\n00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:25.412\n&gt;&gt; Will put it in the show notes.\n\n165\n00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:26.027\nWe'll figure it out.\n\n166\n00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:26.762\n&gt;&gt; I, maybe.\n\n167\n00:08:26.762 --> 00:08:28.145\nI don't remember.\n\n168\n00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:29.305\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I don't know what it is.\n\n169\n00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:30.930\nI'm not sure I'll come up with that one.\n\n170\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.510\nI can pull a lot of\nthings out of thin air.\n\n171\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.440\nBut, that may not be one of them.\n\n172\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.830\n&gt;&gt; That may be beyond your range.\n\n173\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.670\n&gt;&gt; That may be beyond the scope\nof my capabilities today.\n\n174\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.600\nAll right, so.\n\n175\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.540\nMaking sure that we understand that\nwe have these basic files types,\n\n176\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.420\nvery important but\nhey where do they live, right?\n\n177\n00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.380\nWe got to know where they are, so\n\n178\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.510\nwe can actually figure out how to\ngo find them when we need them and\n\n179\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.320\nas a result we can restore them and,\nor work with them, if necessary.\n\n180\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.540\nSo, when we think about\nthe location of these files.\n\n181\n00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.800\nYou wanna join me here, we'll take a look.\n\n182\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.743\nI got some data on the screen\nthat will help us.\n\n183\n00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:08.775\nSo the database and log files will be\nright here in Microsoft SQL server.\n\n184\n00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:09.397\nMS SQL 11.\n\n185\n00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:12.088\nLet me see if I can\nhighlight that whole thing,\n\n186\n00:09:12.088 --> 00:09:14.177\nnot run out of room on the side here.\n\n187\n00:09:14.177 --> 00:09:14.840\n[LAUGH].\n[SOUND].\n\n188\n00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.025\nMy laptop goes flying across the desk.\n\n189\n00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:22.020\nYou could see the path here MS SQL data,\neither MDF or LDF, obviously.\n\n190\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.813\nDepending on what kind of\nfile we're looking at.\n\n191\n00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.363\nJust throwing both on the same line there.\n\n192\n00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:28.944\nBecause essentially they're gonna\nbe in the same path, just so\n\n193\n00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:31.020\nyou know where they are.\n\n194\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.080\nWe see the trace files, which may be\nof interest to us as well, in the log.\n\n195\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.700\nThat will be there in the log directory,\nthat will be there.\n\n196\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.240\nSo in log,\nlog underscore whatever the number is.\n\n197\n00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.531\nRemember, we always start with zero.\n\n198\n00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:44.170\nWe iterate from there or\ndifferent trace files.\n\n199\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.600\nThe sequel server error log files\nare down here at the bottom for\n\n200\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.950\na list like here Microsoft SQL server.\n\n201\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.190\nAgain MSQL 11, MSQL server,\nMSQL Log, Error Log, right?\n\n202\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.560\nSo, no mystery or\nnot a lot of mystery there.\n\n203\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.900\nPretty easy to figure out what those\nlogs are, what the path is and\n\n204\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.970\nwhat's going on there.\n\n205\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.330\nJust by having a little bit of\na sense of the file type extensions.\n\n206\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.300\nAnd of course just paying attention\nto what those directories or\n\n207\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.860\nsub directories may indicate for us.\n\n208\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.870\nBut you again this will vary by product.\n\n209\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.010\nThis will vary by platform.\n\n210\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.760\nSo when you look at an open source SQL or\n\n211\n00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.780\nSQL database that's not Microsoft centric,\nthat path may indeed look very different.\n\n212\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.330\nWant to be aware of that,\nmake sure we are familiar with that.\n\n213\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.480\nBut for Microsoft for\nSQL The database product from Microsoft,\n\n214\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.500\nthis is where we'd be looking.\n\n215\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.116\nAgain, remember, and\nlet's keep this in perspective and\n\n216\n00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:35.380\nkinda just have the right approach and\nfocus here.\n\n217\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.663\nSome people may be out there\nlistening to us going.\n\n218\n00:10:37.663 --> 00:10:40.990\nMy God, I know nothing about database.\n\n219\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.100\nHeard nothing about Microsoft in\nparticular and their databases.\n\n220\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.490\nI'm a little concerned because now I gotta\nmaybe become an expert on databases to get\n\n221\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.530\ncertified as a CHFI or to be able\nto do this job in the real world.\n\n222\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.140\nDo I have that time?\n\n223\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.310\nDo I have that ability?\n\n224\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.270\nI don't work with them.\n\n225\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.190\nI don't know enough about them.\n\n226\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.601\nLook, like anything else, right?\n\n227\n00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:04.280\nWe're gonna talk about a lot of knowledge\nareas that you may not have contact with.\n\n228\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.000\nYou may not do mobile forensics.\n\n229\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.530\nYou may not be interested in or\nhave the ability or\n\n230\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.690\nthe focus to do database forensics.\n\n231\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.500\nAnd that's okay,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n232\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.510\nYou don't have to go out and\n\n233\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.880\nbe a specialist in every one of these\nknowledge areas in order to be good\n\n234\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.710\nat being an investigator and\nbeing a forensics professional overall.\n\n235\n00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.170\nYou just have to choose what you're gonna\nspecialize in and know your strengths.\n\n236\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.765\nAnd as a result make sure you offset those\nareas you're not as comfortable with\n\n237\n00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:32.245\nby bringing in professionals or\nextra people in your team,\n\n238\n00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:34.211\nthat are knowledgable, right?\n\n239\n00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:38.399\nDaniel, maybe indeed,\nis very knowledgeable, in for\n\n240\n00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.460\ninstance Linux,\nOpen source kind of platforms.\n\n241\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.960\nIA bias on a mission not as excited\nabout working on the Mac or Windows.\n\n242\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.600\nNot he can't do that, but it's just he\nprefers to work in those other platforms.\n\n243\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.390\nI'm sure he could do all\nthree if we pushed him to.\n\n244\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.980\nBut if you gave him a choice,\nhe'd probably say.\n\n245\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.780\nHey you know what, I'd rather work on\nsome stuff that has to do with Linux or\n\n246\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.760\nUnix cuz that's where I\nspend a lot of my time.\n\n247\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.520\nSo why don't I do that Adam and\n\n248\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.250\nmaybe you could do the Windows stuff\ncuz you do a lot of Windows stuff.\n\n249\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.480\nSo maybe together we could\nreally help each other out.\n\n250\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.590\nAnd that's the way you wanna\nstructure this and set this up.\n\n251\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.720\nBecause, ultimately, you're not gonna be\nan expert in everything I mean that's\n\n252\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.600\njust an unrealistic expectation.\n\n253\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.890\nI tell customers all the time.\n\n254\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.420\nI tell students all the time.\n\n255\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.590\nHey, I'm not the person you want\ndoing that because that's not me.\n\n256\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.250\nI know people that could do that.\n\n257\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.030\nI could explain how it's done.\n\n258\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.660\nI could tell you what's gonna happen.\n\n259\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.570\nBut I don't do it often enough that when\nthings don't work out the right way,\n\n260\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.410\nthat you want me to be the one who's\nmaking the call about what to do next.\n\n261\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.730\nJust because I may not have that answer.\n\n262\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.650\nBut if it has to do with x, y, z that I do\neveryday, I can do it with my eyes closed.\n\n263\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.850\nLet's go do that right now.\n\n264\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.599\nAnd even if it goes 360\ndegrees the exact opposite\n\n265\n00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:51.587\nof where we're- well, that would be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.You'd be right back to\n\n266\n00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:52.137\nwhere you're at.\n\n267\n00:12:52.137 --> 00:12:53.523\n&gt;&gt; 180 degrees the exact opposite way.\n\n268\n00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.090\nShow you how much I know about math.\n\n269\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.771\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n270\n00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:56.800\n&gt;&gt; There goes the math problem, right?\n\n271\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.060\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now, one of those things you want me to\n\n272\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.290\ndo, and you can see that clearly.\n\n273\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.970\nBut if it goes the opposite direction,\nexactly the way we did not want it to and\n\n274\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.020\ndid not anticipate it would.\n\n275\n00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.830\nHey, I'm the guy.\n\n276\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.620\nI'll figure it out.\n\n277\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.290\nNo big deal.\n\n278\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.640\nJust walk away, come back, and\nI'll tell you what's happening.\n\n279\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.540\nBut I may not be that person for\neverything.\n\n280\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.960\nAnd neither may you, by the way.\n\n281\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.080\nAnd there's no shame in admitting that and\ntelling somebody that.\n\n282\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.040\nI would much rather be\nupfront with a customer.\n\n283\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.690\nAnd tell them what I can do to help them\nthan explain after the fact why I couldn't\n\n284\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.880\nfigure out what they expected me to do and\nhave that embarrassing conversation.\n\n285\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.700\nAnd perhaps that risk laden conversation\nabout responsibility and blame.\n\n286\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.260\nRight?\n\n287\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.130\nSo I would much rather admit upfront\nthat I'm going to be good for\n\n288\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.670\ncertain things and not for others.\n\n289\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.840\nAnd that's a hard thing to do sometimes,\nbut\n\n290\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.220\nI am telling you from\nfirst-hand experience.\n\n291\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.440\nYou gotta be willing to do that if you're\ngonna be able to be successful at doing\n\n292\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.450\nthis kind of a job.\n\n293\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.490\nBecause there are going to be situations\nthat are not going to fit any preconceived\n\n294\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.870\nidea of what these fools do, what this\ninformation should be, and how to recover.\n\n295\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.820\nAnd you're going to have a very slim\nwindow and a very slim margin of error.\n\n296\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.810\nAnd if you're not 150% confident,\nyou're gonna blow that window up.\n\n297\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.390\nAnd you're gonna wind up\nscrewing up things badly.\n\n298\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.890\nAnd not that you did not on purpose,\nI want to be clear,\n\n299\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.200\nI'm sure you're not looking\nto do it on purpose.\n\n300\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.520\nBut that doesn't excuse the fact\nthat you made bad decisions.\n\n301\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.400\n'Cause you only get one chance to\nget it right in this kind of job.\n\n302\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.200\nAnd if don't get it right,\nit's been talked about,\n\n303\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.320\nthe liability there is that\nthe evidence is tainted permanently.\n\n304\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.890\nAnd as result bad people that\nhave done some really bad things\n\n305\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.910\nmay actually get to go do that again\nbecause we weren't able to stop them.\n\n306\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.460\nAnd that would be horrendously\nbad outcome for lots of reasons,\n\n307\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.790\nnot the least of which that you could\nhave actually had a positive impact.\n\n308\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.440\nAnd potentially stop those bad people,\nif you only thought better of it, right?\n\n309\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.230\nSo, you got to remember that and make sure\nyou're humble about what you can do and\n\n310\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.060\nhumble about the things\nyou're not able to do, right?\n\n311\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.270\nThat's the real important one.\n\n312\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.790\nRemember the search for\nthe holy grail, right?\n\n313\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where the humble man bows before god\n\n314\n00:14:50.273 --> 00:14:51.141\nand that whole thing.\n\n315\n00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:54.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He doesn't get\nhis head chopped off.\n\n316\n00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.640\n&gt;&gt; With his flying razor blades.\n\n317\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.740\nYou want to be humble.\n\n318\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.915\nDon't be that guy that stands up and\nsays me.\n\n319\n00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:01.879\n[SOUND] And here comes the razor, right?\n\n320\n00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:05.000\nThe spinning blade,\nthe saw blade or whatever it was.\n\n321\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Definitely watched that movie,\nI don't know Steven Spielberg.\n\n322\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; It was awesome though.\n\n323\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.820\n&gt;&gt; Do not want to get invited\nover to dinner at that place.\n\n324\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.690\n&gt;&gt; This is George Lucas right,\n\n325\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.730\nhe wrote the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but still, just the two of them.\n\n326\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're a power house.\n\n327\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they are just, really cool stuff.\n\n328\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.028\nAnyway, we digress.\n\n329\n00:15:20.028 --> 00:15:22.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n330\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.138\nAlso wanted to think about and\njust talk a bit about with you,\n\n331\n00:15:25.138 --> 00:15:26.414\nthe idea of another area.\n\n332\n00:15:26.414 --> 00:15:30.734\nAnother database that is in\ntransact SQL databases or\n\n333\n00:15:30.734 --> 00:15:35.345\nset ups in Transact-SQL,\nthe SP Help, sp_help.db.\n\n334\n00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:38.337\nThis is where information\nabout a specified database or\n\n335\n00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.980\nall databases will typically be reported.\n\n336\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.870\nAnd we can actually return some\ninformation from that database to tell us\n\n337\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.680\nthe structure of other databases.\n\n338\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.450\nSince you wanna join me here and\ntake a look.\n\n339\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.665\nWe can see this.\n\n340\n00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:52.660\nSo, using Transact-SQL, so\n\n341\n00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.695\nT-SQL essentially just commands\nthat can be issued, right?\n\n342\n00:15:56.695 --> 00:15:59.152\nAnd can query in this case a database.\n\n343\n00:15:59.152 --> 00:16:01.118\nSo if we query the sp_help.db,\n\n344\n00:16:01.118 --> 00:16:04.710\nwe've provide the names of\nthe end parameter here for name.\n\n345\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.971\nI just made up a name ITPROtvDEMO.\n\n346\n00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:08.510\nLet's assume that's our database.\n\n347\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.635\nIf we query that, we'll return\ninformation about the named instance,\n\n348\n00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:12.978\nthe specific database.\n\n349\n00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:17.250\nIf we wanna get all information about all\ndatabases in the system, just go ahead and\n\n350\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.410\nquery the sp_helpdb,\n\n351\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.660\nright, broadly without specifying\na name that would return any and\n\n352\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.260\nall information, or I should say, all\ninformation about any database instances.\n\n353\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.970\nSo again, just thinking about the logic\nabout how we start nibbling away at,\n\n354\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.190\nchipping away at some of the database\ninformation that's there and\n\n355\n00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.190\ninformation about it.\n\n356\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.058\nI know you do a lot of, Daniel, a lot of\nwork in the open source area in Linux,\n\n357\n00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:41.218\ncertainly Unix and even non-Unix,\nLinux, and Microsoft.\n\n358\n00:16:41.218 --> 00:16:43.902\nBut are you hacking away at those\ndatabases, spending time doing something?\n\n359\n00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:47.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit because a lot of web\nfront ends are connecting to databases on\n\n360\n00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:50.290\nthe back end, obviously using something.\n\n361\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.910\nYeah, a lot of times,\nit will be some sort of Maria DB or\n\n362\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.180\nMySQL, something to that effect.\n\n363\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.921\nSo you have to be at least a little\n[CROSSTALK] yeah, enough SQL,\n\n364\n00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.745\nand those types of database knowledge,\njust so\n\n365\n00:17:03.745 --> 00:17:07.643\nyou can kick your feet around\ninside of it, once you gain access.\n\n366\n00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:09.570\nSo you gotta be able to do that.\n\n367\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.030\nYou can grab those usernames and\n\n368\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.350\npasswords that might be lurking\ninside of that database.\n\n369\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n370\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.620\nRemember the injection, the goal, one of\nthe key goals of the SQL injection attacks\n\n371\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.500\nis to trip over that information,\nextract it out of those databases.\n\n372\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.870\nUsernames and passwords,\n\n373\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.590\nmaybe account numbers, things like that\nare traditionally targets of those tables.\n\n374\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:30.420\nWe'll take a look at how to examine what's\nin some of those databases using a tool,\n\n375\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.490\njust see them kind of walking through\nthe database here in a little bit.\n\n376\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.690\nBut another area I wanna focus on or\nthink about is the DBCC log info command.\n\n377\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.820\nThis is yet another one that can\ngive us a lot of information.\n\n378\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.293\nI have a little website that\nactually is gonna help us out here.\n\n379\n00:17:45.293 --> 00:17:48.426\nSo this particular blog\npost from SQLblog.com,\n\n380\n00:17:48.426 --> 00:17:53.054\nKalen Delaney's blog post on exploring\nthe transaction log structure,\n\n381\n00:17:53.054 --> 00:17:56.877\none of the best ones I found out\nthere on this really good one.\n\n382\n00:17:56.877 --> 00:17:59.629\nSo try to call those things out and\nrecommend them,\n\n383\n00:17:59.629 --> 00:18:03.350\nwhen we do come across them,\nprovide them to you as resources.\n\n384\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.210\nSo you can certainly check out\nthe URL in the show notes.\n\n385\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.370\nGet that, yeah, get over this [LAUGH] that\ndrop down, Edge does these weird things.\n\n386\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.968\nI'm like, I'm not even hovering,\nI'm not even near that, and\n\n387\n00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.830\nI've got this pulled down little\nwindow shape across the URL.\n\n388\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.740\nDon't know what's going on there.\n\n389\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.480\nAnyway, see, you could see here\nthat it does a really good job.\n\n390\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:27.192\nHe does a really good of exploring the\ntransaction logs, the structure of them,\n\n391\n00:18:27.192 --> 00:18:32.232\ngives us links to some other stuff,\ntalks about a great techman article\n\n392\n00:18:32.232 --> 00:18:37.100\nfrom Paul Randle about some of\nthe basic structures of SQL Server.\n\n393\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.430\nThe database and kind of how it's set up,\nand again, maybe valuable as background\n\n394\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.600\nfor you, especially if you're\nnew to database forensics.\n\n395\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.416\nYou gotta get your feet wet a little bit,\nas Daniel was suggesting.\n\n396\n00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:50.513\nMicrosoft's kind of its own little world\ncompared to some of the other databases.\n\n397\n00:18:50.513 --> 00:18:53.570\nSo there are some unique\nthings you wanna do there.\n\n398\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.800\nBut the idea is that the DBCC log info\ncommand right here returns one row\n\n399\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:05.770\nper VLF, virtual log, and includes\nthe following columner information.\n\n400\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:11.624\nSo you could see a detail breakdown of all\nthe different columns that get returned,\n\n401\n00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:16.555\nthe field id, file size, start offset,\nthe FSEC node, the status,\n\n402\n00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:21.500\nthe parity, the create command,\nall the stuff associated here.\n\n403\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.470\nSo it's just got a nice\ndescription of all this.\n\n404\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.203\nTalks a bit about what we expect to see\nfrom the transaction log as we issue\n\n405\n00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:30.995\nthis command and explore.\n\n406\n00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:35.260\nBecause this is gonna help us to, again,\nextract meaning from the information.\n\n407\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.020\nThe hard part is not figuring out\nhow to get access to the logs.\n\n408\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.660\nThe hard part is interpreting them and\nunderstanding what is in there,\n\n409\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.690\nwhat they are, and that way, for instance,\nyou have something like file size, right?\n\n410\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.330\nPretty straightforward, it's in bytes.\n\n411\n00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.034\nBut you just have to understand how to\nwork with that, the field ID, right,\n\n412\n00:19:53.034 --> 00:19:56.790\nthe start offset,\nthe offsets are always important.\n\n413\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.490\nThe value for offsets are in bytes.\n\n414\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.150\nAgain, you'd have to know that and\nunderstand how to work with that and\n\n415\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.180\nwork backwards to get meaning out of\nsome of the data that may be there.\n\n416\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.212\nSo it is important for us to think about\nthese things and have a sense of them.\n\n417\n00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.223\nBecause if we're not familiar with\nthem them, then the logs just may be\n\n418\n00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:15.836\na collection of interesting stuff, but\nsomething that we really, unfortunately,\n\n419\n00:20:15.836 --> 00:20:17.611\nare not able to make heads or\ntails out of.\n\n420\n00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:19.375\nAnd they may not be very valuable.\n\n421\n00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.106\nCollection, in other words,\n\n422\n00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:25.490\nof the active transaction logs is only\nthe beginning of the journey, right?\n\n423\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.315\nInterpreting them is really where the fun\nand the, ultimately, the value is.\n\n424\n00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:32.381\nSo that's where hard work ultimately lies.\n\n425\n00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:36.898\nBut collecting those transaction logs\nusing either SQL Server Management Studio,\n\n426\n00:20:36.898 --> 00:20:40.842\nSSMS, the standard front end graphical\ntool on the Microsoft platform,\n\n427\n00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:42.251\nis usually how we do this.\n\n428\n00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:45.466\nWe'll go and use that as our\ngraphical browser, and we can see and\n\n429\n00:20:45.466 --> 00:20:46.792\ninteract with stuff.\n\n430\n00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:50.502\nBut there's some different functions that\nwe can go in and use there, if you wanna\n\n431\n00:20:50.502 --> 00:20:53.552\ngive me just one second, I will bring\nthose up for us so we can see them.\n\n432\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.432\nHave them right here, if you just wanna\nbring those back up, we can take a look.\n\n433\n00:20:58.432 --> 00:21:02.130\nThe fn_dblog function\nallows us to retrieve\n\n434\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.760\nthe active portion of the transaction log\nfile by using that function in the SSMS,\n\n435\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.090\nwe can interact with that.\n\n436\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:13.230\nThe fn_dblog function will have\nthe ability to be filtered by,\n\n437\n00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.330\nor will filter transactions by\na couple of different parameters here.\n\n438\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.480\nTarget database object, so\nwhat database am I targeting?\n\n439\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.970\nWhere am I getting that data from?\n\n440\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.770\nWhat column or columns do I wanna see,\nso what's the information?\n\n441\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.640\nAnd the SPID and, or\ndate or time ranges, right?\n\n442\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.400\nSo the process id or whatever the id is\nthat's unique and the following query\n\n443\n00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.230\nwill display the active portion\nof the transaction log file.\n\n444\n00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.578\nSo if we just run this query right here,\nwe will get that active portion.\n\n445\n00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:46.357\nLet me just bump up one line there,\nso you can see, that will work, and\n\n446\n00:21:46.357 --> 00:21:51.040\nif we're specifying an ID indeed,\nI did specify the nulls here.\n\n447\n00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.380\nYou may see this query done\nwithout the nulls, it depends.\n\n448\n00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.200\nBut Select * from ::fn_dblog(NULL,\nNULL), the null values implied there, or\n\n449\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.292\nthe null values that they put there,\nare implying start and end points for\n\n450\n00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:06.413\nthe log sequence numbers\nare not specified, the LSNs.\n\n451\n00:22:06.413 --> 00:22:11.420\nIf I don't do the nulls, I have to specify\nwhat those sequence numbers will be.\n\n452\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.790\nSo I may, as I said,\nsee this with or without the nulls,\n\n453\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.250\ndepending on what kind of\ninformation I'm looking for.\n\n454\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.650\nIf I wanna just see everything,\nI won't specify the log sequence numbers.\n\n455\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.456\nIf I may wanna zero in on\na certain range in the logs,\n\n456\n00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:27.243\nas maybe I've done the overall search,\nnow I've got an idea of hey,\n\n457\n00:22:27.243 --> 00:22:30.072\nI wanna see this block\nright here from 25 to 50.\n\n458\n00:22:30.072 --> 00:22:33.140\nOr whatever that would be,\njust randomly making up some numbers.\n\n459\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.210\nI put the log sequence\nnumbers in from 25 to 50,\n\n460\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.080\nand I would just see that portion of log.\n\n461\n00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.050\nIt's like a filter, such,\nso it's being applied.\n\n462\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.930\nAnd as a result,\nwe return back that information.\n\n463\n00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.296\nSo, again, understanding some\nof the conceptual ideas,\n\n464\n00:22:46.296 --> 00:22:50.557\nyou want a high level between or around\nthe idea of this query being issued.\n\n465\n00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:53.895\nIt's helpful just to get\na sense of what we would see.\n\n466\n00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:55.525\nNow again, you don't have to go and\n\n467\n00:22:55.525 --> 00:22:58.115\ndo a lot of this work on your own\nif you're not comfortable with it.\n\n468\n00:22:58.115 --> 00:23:01.893\nBut I would suggest certainly for the\nexam, a query like the one I just called\n\n469\n00:23:01.893 --> 00:23:06.101\nout to you, just having a general idea of\nthe structure, why we would use the NULLs.\n\n470\n00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.065\nWhat the language of that\nquery will do for us,\n\n471\n00:23:09.065 --> 00:23:12.710\nwhat is the fn_dblog function,\nwhat does it do?\n\n472\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:16.226\nThose are things you may be wanting to\nspend a little time on with regards to\n\n473\n00:23:16.226 --> 00:23:18.905\nMicrosoft, making sure\nyou're comfortable with it.\n\n474\n00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:20.095\nJust have a sense of it,\n\n475\n00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:23.378\nmay be valuable to you when you\nget asked some questions about it.\n\n476\n00:23:23.378 --> 00:23:28.898\nThe DBCC LOG command allows us to view and\nretrieve those transaction log files for\n\n477\n00:23:28.898 --> 00:23:31.865\nthe specified database, as I suggested.\n\n478\n00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:34.470\nCould we go full screen, so you could\nsee what's going on behind me there?\n\n479\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.010\nAnd you'll see that there are other\ncommands with DBCC, right, that\n\n480\n00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.430\nwill allow us to get a bunch of additional\ninformation that are very valuable.\n\n481\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.870\nGot six of them listed here,\njust so you know, DBCC DBTABLE.\n\n482\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.670\nSo DBCC LOG is just one command,\nin other words, that DBCC can use.\n\n483\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.178\nWe have DBTABLE, DBINFO, PROCBUF,\nright, BUFFER, SHOWFILESTATS, PAGE,\n\n484\n00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:00.912\nall of these are commands that will\nbe helpful for us to be aware of.\n\n485\n00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:05.812\nThat we should have some knowledge of, and\nthat we wanna make sure that we at least\n\n486\n00:24:05.812 --> 00:24:10.878\ncan describe, one sentence definition Hey,\nwhat do I get back with DBCC DBTABLE?\n\n487\n00:24:10.878 --> 00:24:13.150\nWell, that gives us the structure\nof the selected database table.\n\n488\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.870\nIn other words, shows us all the mapping\ninformation and the structure we need.\n\n489\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.060\nWhat about the DBINFO?\n\n490\n00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.040\nAll the related information\naround the database metadata.\n\n491\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.420\nWho the creator was, when it was created,\nhow big it is, where it's stored.\n\n492\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.930\nAll the metadata stuff\nthat would be important.\n\n493\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.120\nThe stuff about stuff as we said.\n\n494\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.123\n&gt;&gt; The stuff about stuff, I like that.\n\n495\n00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:32.550\n&gt;&gt; That's what meta data is,\nit's the stuff about stuff.\n\n496\n00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.180\nI'm actually convinced it's the white,\nfluffy stuffing inside the Oreos,\n\n497\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:37.970\nthat's what meta is.\n\n498\n00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.540\nIt's the stuff about stuff\nthat makes the Oreos.\n\n499\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Man, I love that stuff.\n\n500\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Or nutter, what is it?\n\n501\n00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Fluffer nutter, yeah fluffer nutter.\n\n502\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.740\nThe white stuff right,\nthe marshmallow stuff.\n\n503\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Fluffy, Fluff, it's just called Fluff.\n\n504\n00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.990\n&gt;&gt; Shows you how often I eat that stuff.\n\n505\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.535\n&gt;&gt; My wife loves that, thinks it's great.\n\n506\n00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:54.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n507\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.860\nyou can see we have all sorts\nof different commands right.\n\n508\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.000\nSo we just again, or excuse me,\n\n509\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.060\ncommands that will draw\nadditional information down.\n\n510\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.490\nIt would be good for\nyou to have a sense of these.\n\n511\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.190\nI can honestly say that I do,\nI can't really remember\n\n512\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.420\nthe last time I had to do any kind of\nsignificant forensics, or hacking work, or\n\n513\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.550\ncombination that I didn't interact with\nat least one Microsoft database somewhere\n\n514\n00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.930\nin that enterprise-level organization.\n\n515\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.110\nIf this is a single machine\nthat's got malware,\n\n516\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.040\nor it's been broken into, and\nyou're doing, just a diagnostic or\n\n517\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.920\nan investigation on one machine,\nchances are good, unless it's a server,\n\n518\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.640\nyou're not going to come across\na Microsoft SQL database.\n\n519\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.450\nYou may see SQL Light, SQL Express,\n\n520\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.510\nin other words, localized versions they'll\nhave access to certain commands, but\n\n521\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.240\nin general,\nyou're probably not gonna see that.\n\n522\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.150\nThis is when we're dealing with\nplaying in the data center and\n\n523\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.180\nwe're dealing with lots and\nlots and lots of servers.\n\n524\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.685\nAs Daniel made a point, which I think is\nan excellent one, when you're dealing with\n\n525\n00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:49.300\nweb-related infrastructure\nyou're dealing with data bases.\n\n526\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.060\nThe only question is, where are they, what\nkind are they, and how do you get to them?\n\n527\n00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.006\nBecause there's gotta be a data base\non the back end of that web service,\n\n528\n00:25:56.006 --> 00:25:57.420\nit's just a matter of where it is.\n\n529\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.015\nCuz that's where the information gets\nstored, unless we're talking about a very\n\n530\n00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:06.217\ngeneric plane, minimal simplistic web\nserver that really does nothing but\n\n531\n00:26:06.217 --> 00:26:08.464\nserve up a, hey, welcome to home page.\n\n532\n00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:11.266\nCuz the minute you start\ndealing with foreign data,\n\n533\n00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:16.041\nyou start dealing with catalogs, you start\ndealing with multiple pages, bying stuff,\n\n534\n00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:19.750\nlogging in, seeing data we're\npulling that stuff from somewhere.\n\n535\n00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.945\nIt's not coming from local files\non the web server traditionally,\n\n536\n00:26:22.945 --> 00:26:26.075\nit's gotta be store somewhere,\nit's gotta be rendered, and we've gotta\n\n537\n00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:30.275\nbe able to managed and manipulate that\ndata using scalable data engines.\n\n538\n00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:32.035\nAnd that's what databases are, right?\n\n539\n00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:35.715\nSo, we want to think about that and\nmake sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n540\n00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:38.835\nWe also have a something called\nthe Database Plan Cache and\n\n541\n00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:44.230\nwe cam recover that using a query this\nhelps us to understand the mapping.\n\n542\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.620\nAnd the information for\n\n543\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.520\nall the rows in the query plan\nthe SQL server has loaded or cached.\n\n544\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.460\nEssentially, caching means load into\nmemory with regards to databases.\n\n545\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.140\nWhen you think about the logic of this,\nwe load databases into memory so\n\n546\n00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.210\nthey execute faster.\n\n547\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.280\nI mean,\nthat's how we performance optimize them.\n\n548\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.910\nThat's why databases take so long or\ndatabase servers take so long to cycle.\n\n549\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.820\nWhen you power them off, power them\nback on, there's a delay, typically,\n\n550\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.930\ncuz the database has to load into memory\nas you're restarting the system and\n\n551\n00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.165\nyou're getting it ready to go and if the\ndatabase is big, it could take a while.\n\n552\n00:27:15.165 --> 00:27:18.365\nSo we do wanna get this\ninformation forensically as well.\n\n553\n00:27:18.365 --> 00:27:19.985\nIt's gonna tell us what's\nsitting in memory.\n\n554\n00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:23.465\nThis is dynamic volatile data and\nwe wanna understand that.\n\n555\n00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:28.445\nSo going after the database plan cache,\ngives us essentially the road map and\n\n556\n00:27:28.445 --> 00:27:32.005\nthe dynamic layout, the grid view,\nfor what's in memory.\n\n557\n00:27:32.005 --> 00:27:34.640\nIt's actually pretty important stuff,\nso if you wanna join me here.\n\n558\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.560\nI'll show you what this looks like,\nthe query that we can issue just to\n\n559\n00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.290\npull this down right here to\ncollect the database plan cache.\n\n560\n00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.580\nFollowing queries, just so we know what\nwe're doing you can see the cache,\n\n561\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.970\nor excuse me, see the command.\n\n562\n00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.910\nLet me just, whoops,\ndidn't mean to do that.\n\n563\n00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.340\nOkay, hold on.\n\n564\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.248\n&gt;&gt; You did it anyway.\n\n565\n00:27:56.248 --> 00:27:59.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did it anyway, hold on one\nsecond, I can fix this, no problem.\n\n566\n00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:05.120\nJust give me half a second,\ncuz that is not a big deal,\n\n567\n00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.960\njust bring the notes right back up again,\njust put them right back where they were.\n\n568\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.120\nAll I was gonna do was simply move that\nquery over, so that we could see it.\n\n569\n00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.175\nLike that but instead of doing that, I\n&gt;&gt; You did the old [LAUGH].\n\n570\n00:28:18.175 --> 00:28:23.810\n&gt;&gt; Did something stupid, but\nyou know, hey, what can I tell you.\n\n571\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.154\nSo now we can see a little bit easier,\n\n572\n00:28:26.154 --> 00:28:29.417\nit's sitting in the middle of the screen,\nright?\n\n573\n00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:34.229\nSo, you'll see here,\nselect * from the sys.dm_exec_cache_plans\n\n574\n00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:38.280\ncross apply\nsys.dm_exec_sql_text(plan_handle).\n\n575\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.630\nBy issuing this query,\nwe get the row for each query planner,\n\n576\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.630\nthe rows that are entered into memory,\nright?\n\n577\n00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.790\nSo we can get this to come back and\nwe can see this information.\n\n578\n00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.065\nYou'll see we get the ability to\nbe able to look at the amount of\n\n579\n00:28:51.065 --> 00:28:54.345\nmemory that's taken by the cache plan,\nthe reused count of the cache plan.\n\n580\n00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:58.055\nWe get to see a lot of stuff that helps us\nto map out what's going on in there and\n\n581\n00:28:58.055 --> 00:29:00.115\nwe get all of that cache data.\n\n582\n00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:03.345\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe'll be able to understand and\n\n583\n00:29:03.345 --> 00:29:06.257\nsee, or at least have an expectation\nof what should be in memory,\n\n584\n00:29:06.257 --> 00:29:07.989\nand then when we go to\ndo a memory dump and\n\n585\n00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:12.547\nwe've talked about how to do a memory dump\nand different ways we could approach that.\n\n586\n00:29:12.547 --> 00:29:16.747\nWhen we think about doing that in the\nupcoming conversations in cloud forensics,\n\n587\n00:29:16.747 --> 00:29:19.668\nI'll actually demonstrate a live RAM\ncapture for you, so we'll go ahead and\n\n588\n00:29:19.668 --> 00:29:22.948\nwe'll dump some live memory from the\nmachine just so you can see how it's done.\n\n589\n00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:28.518\nShow you then how to do a quick string,\na search using any kind of a hex editor,\n\n590\n00:29:28.518 --> 00:29:30.760\nload the memory image\nup into a hex editor.\n\n591\n00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.010\nAnd then do a quick string\nsearch looking for values, so\n\n592\n00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.110\nif we have this information and we grabbed\nit, we could cross-reference it against\n\n593\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.740\nwhat we found on the dynamic memory of the\ndatabase to ensure that it's accurate so\n\n594\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.660\nthat we know that there is not\nany data that is unaccounted for.\n\n595\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.810\nThis is one of the things\nthat we may wanna do.\n\n596\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:52.210\nAnd so there is some Microsoft\ndocumentation on the data, or\n\n597\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.740\nthe exact cached plans the TSQL\ncommands and the queries for them.\n\n598\n00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.360\nAgain another really good way to go\nout and learn about some of this and,\n\n599\n00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.770\nby the way,\nI'll just point out that this particular\n\n600\n00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.340\npage we're looking at goes all the way\nback to SQL server starting with 2008,\n\n601\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.090\nwe're now on SQL 16 got several versions.\n\n602\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.820\nBut also the azure SQL databases, and\n\n603\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.920\nthe parallel data warehouse,\nas well as the azure SQL data warehouse.\n\n604\n00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.250\nMeaning, both the local\ninstalled on prem and\n\n605\n00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.460\nonline cloud-based versions of SQL\nare going to behave the same way.\n\n606\n00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.960\nThis is again imported, when we look ahead\nto the Cloud forensics conversations,\n\n607\n00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.290\ndatabases in the Cloud\nare not unusual today.\n\n608\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.360\nAnd we have to understand\nhow to operate with them.\n\n609\n00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.350\nAnd it's good to know that this kind\nof information would apply there.\n\n610\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.960\nSo this will give you the information\nof what you get back for\n\n611\n00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.950\nor from the cache plan.\n\n612\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.920\nWhen you take a look and you can see\nthe bucket id, all the columns are here\n\n613\n00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.970\nthe ref counts, the use counts,\nthe size in bytes of the information.\n\n614\n00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.250\nFor each cached object,\nwe see how big they are in memory.\n\n615\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.570\nOne of the things we often do,\n\n616\n00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.900\nwe'll compare that with an actual\nsnapshot of the memory,\n\n617\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.980\nmake sure there's no difference then we\nknow the data's not being manipulated.\n\n618\n00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.365\nSo we want to see that, the memory\nobject addresses, the cached objects,\n\n619\n00:31:02.365 --> 00:31:02.995\nwhat are they?\n\n620\n00:31:02.995 --> 00:31:06.345\nThe object types,\nthe plan handles, the pool id.\n\n621\n00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:09.635\nAll the stuff we need is\ngonna be detailed out here.\n\n622\n00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:11.135\nAnd so\nwe want to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n623\n00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.465\nSo this article may give\nyou a good grounding,\n\n624\n00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:16.135\ngood general sense of background\non this kind of stuff.\n\n625\n00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:19.160\nAnd just help us to have a better sense\n\n626\n00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.595\nof understanding how to pull in\nsome of this dynamic memory data.\n\n627\n00:31:22.595 --> 00:31:27.240\nSo dynamic data around the caching\nin memory is what I mean to say.\n\n628\n00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.960\nSo hopefully that will prove\nto be valuable for you.\n\n629\n00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.930\nBut remember SQL is this\nmulti-faceted tool,\n\n630\n00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.710\nwe're gonna have a lot\nof data hiding in there.\n\n631\n00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.540\nWe need to understand how to make heads or\ntails out of it.\n\n632\n00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.796\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nNow the good news is if you have a lot\n\n633\n00:31:37.796 --> 00:31:40.422\nof experience using a Microsoft SQL or\njust SQL,\n\n634\n00:31:40.422 --> 00:31:43.836\nT-SQL in general,\nyou shouldn't be too worried about this.\n\n635\n00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:46.549\nYou're like,\nthis is right in my wheelhouse, and\n\n636\n00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:49.956\nnow I know exactly where to focus my\nefforts so that I can understand and\n\n637\n00:31:49.956 --> 00:31:52.970\njust get right to the point of\nwhat the CHFI needs me to know.\n\n638\n00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.770\nAnd if you don't have a lot of experience\nwith databases, now is a good time for you\n\n639\n00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.380\nto start your foray into that, especially\nbecause you do need some understanding.\n\n640\n00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.350\nYou don't have to be a DBA,\nthank goodness.\n\n641\n00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.010\nYou can just focus in on what the CHFI\nhas giving us to focus in on and\n\n642\n00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.080\njust learn those aspects of it.\n\n643\n00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.300\nBut it never hurts to\ncontinue on your education.\n\n644\n00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.010\nThat being said, looks like we're\noutta time for this episode.\n\n645\n00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.710\nWe do appreciate your watching but,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n646\n00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.440\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n647\n00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n648\n00:32:21.310

host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n10\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.570\nwe're moving forward with more\nin our CHFI version nine series.\n\n11\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.490\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studios again today,\n\n12\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.020\nmore on database forensics,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.920\nAdam, we're glad to have\nyou back again today.\n\n14\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.730\nHow's it going, sir?\n\n15\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Nanu nanu.\n\n16\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Nanu nanu.\n\n17\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.760\n&gt;&gt; Mork from Ork, right?\n\n18\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n19\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the official greeting\nof the Robin Williams fan club.\n\n20\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.200\n&gt;&gt; I love how he drank milk,\nhe just stuck his finger in there.\n\n21\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was cool, that actually was.\n\n22\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.260\nHe was awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n23\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.652\n[CROSSTALK] that brilliant comic and\nclassic actor, stuff like that,\n\n24\n00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:48.521\nbefore we got back into this.\n\n25\n00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:51.620\nHe would be on the list if [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; He would definitely be on the list.\n\n26\n00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.907\nI'm a huge Robin Williams fan.\n\n27\n00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Big, big, big, larger than life person.\n\n28\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.860\nAll right, so let's get back to\nour conversations with regards to\n\n29\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.960\na little bit of just left over a little\nbit of the dregs for Microsoft SQL.\n\n30\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.900\nA couple of things just\nto clean up real quick.\n\n31\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.250\nRemind you where some log files are,\n\n32\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.050\nwe're gonna do that right\nnow while we're talking.\n\n33\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.150\nWanna go through our standard\nmethodology conversation with you.\n\n34\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.510\nWhat's the database forensics\ninvestigative methodology look like?\n\n35\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.150\nIt's kind of the equivalent of\nthe secret handshake, right, for\n\n36\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.295\nthe clubhouse or something.\n\n37\n00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.210\nSo, wanna go through that.\n\n38\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.045\nWe got a ten step process,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n39\n00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:26.450\nWanna talk a little bit about MySQL open\nsource relational database extraordinaire.\n\n40\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.020\nGo through that,\ntalk about where some log files will be.\n\n41\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.340\nJust some things we wanna\nmake sure we know about, and\n\n42\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.790\nwrap up our database forensics discussion.\n\n43\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.710\nCap that whole thing off\nwith a little show and tell.\n\n44\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.250\nWe'll talk a look at the SQL viewer,\nthe DB SQL viewer.\n\n45\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.690\nGo in, pull some tables in,\n\n46\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.970\ntake a look at what we may find as we\nforensically investigate some data.\n\n47\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.080\nYou never know what may be\nlurking in those databases.\n\n48\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.050\nSo, please join me over here if you will.\n\n49\n00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.050\nHow do we collect those trace files?\n\n50\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.340\nWe did talk in the prior episode about\nthe trace files in SQL, the .trc files,\n\n51\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.770\nyou'll see the path for them there.\n\n52\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.920\nHow do we collect SQL Server error logs?\n\n53\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.040\nYou'll see the path for those there.\n\n54\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.790\nJust reminding you where\nwe will find them.\n\n55\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.150\nRemember, it's always important to\nknow where to go find these files,\n\n56\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.390\nvalidate the data that's there.\n\n57\n00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.740\nYou never know when you're gonna\nfind stuff that will be important.\n\n58\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.760\nSo just want to take note of those.\n\n59\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.950\nOur methodology, right here.\n\n60\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.010\nWhat's our methodology for database\nforensics on the Microsoft platform?\n\n61\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.050\nIf we took away that first item and\n\n62\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.640\njust said let's examine error logs,\nlet's start with trace files, or\n\n63\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.960\nthe equivalent of trace files,\nand just kinda genericize that.\n\n64\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.180\nIt could be a methodology for\nany kinda database, forensics.\n\n65\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.450\nSo really, the Windows specific piece\nis just that first one right there for\n\n66\n00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.830\nWindows Logs and\nlooking at the Windows Logs.\n\n67\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.610\nRemember, SQL Server databases\nare installed on top of Microsoft OSs.\n\n68\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.200\nSo our OS forensics conversation,\nthat was one of the prior discussions\n\n69\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.980\nwe had heavily weighted in favor\nof Microsoft operating systems,\n\n70\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.870\ncertainly talked a little bit about\nLinux and the Mac OS there as well.\n\n71\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.260\nBut did more time on the Windows piece,\nthat would be a good cross-reference\n\n72\n00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.900\nknowledge point for\nthis particular part of the conversation.\n\n73\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.660\nSo you can see the methodology there,\nfrom an exam preparation standpoint.\n\n74\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.590\nAlways important to know what\nthose methodological steps will be\n\n75\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.080\nin the real world,\napplying that knowledge.\n\n76\n00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.960\nHow do we go after these database files,\nhow do we see what's actively in memory?\n\n77\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.600\nRemember we talked about the database plan\ncache, looking at that, dumping that,\n\n78\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.200\nmaking sure we know what\nthe memory map looks like.\n\n79\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.620\nWe showed you some web real estate that\nwill help us to decipher the kind of table\n\n80\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.140\nentries and columns and rows we're gonna\nfind there, what we're looking at.\n\n81\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.470\nTalked about the importance of things\nlike the schema, the map, the road map,\n\n82\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.830\nthe organizational\nstructure of the database.\n\n83\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.160\nAll these things are important, so we\nwanna make sure we have knowledge of them,\n\n84\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.780\nand have a sense of why we're\ngonna go after this information,\n\n85\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.515\nwhere it is, how we're gonna find it,\nand what value it may give us.\n\n86\n00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:46.880\nSo, just wrapping up our conversations\non the Microsoft SQL space.\n\n87\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.910\nWhen we think about being a DBA,\nand Daniel and\n\n88\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.540\nI have talked about the fact that you\ndon't have to be the database expert to be\n\n89\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.170\nforensic investigator on databases.\n\n90\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.630\nNot that it hurts, right?\n\n91\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.130\nMay help, wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n92\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.320\nBut if you don't have that knowledge,\nthat's okay.\n\n93\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.030\nRemember, from an exam perspective,\n\n94\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.930\nyou're not being asked to take\na Microsoft SQL exam, right?\n\n95\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.210\nYou're not gonna be tested\non being an MCDBA, right?\n\n96\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.440\nYou're being tested on just a very small\npiece of a much larger pool of knowledge\n\n97\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.200\naround some Microsoft stuff.\n\n98\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.860\nAnd if you miss one or\ntwo of those questions,\n\n99\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.050\nwell, not the worst thing in the world\nif you're not the expert there.\n\n100\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.780\nBut don't kill yourself trying to become\nthat Microsoft database expert for this\n\n101\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.990\nexam, cuz you're over-studying and it's\njust not gonna be where the questions are.\n\n102\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.480\nYou can see just based on the weighting of\nthe material, the number of episodes we've\n\n103\n00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.710\ndone in certain areas, and\nthe smaller number of episodes in others,\n\n104\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.550\nthat some stuff's just not gonna be\nas well represented on the exam in\n\n105\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.180\nterms of the volume of material as other\ntopics, and you should study accordingly.\n\n106\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.370\nJust general thought process,\nhopefully helpful for you there.\n\n107\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.620\nGive you a little insight into\nwhat we are thinking about.\n\n108\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.320\nWhen we think about MySQL,\n\n109\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.560\nopen source relational database,\ndata stored in the database,\n\n110\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.830\nit's duplicated into different files,\nlog files, things like that.\n\n111\n00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.330\nSo it's in multiple places.\n\n112\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.440\nThe average user goes in,\ndeletes data from the database front end.\n\n113\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.760\nThey're not actually technically deleting\ndata from all the database files, but\n\n114\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.990\nrather maybe just one or two of\nthe multiple places the data will live.\n\n115\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.460\nSo, we want to keep that in mind,\nwant to be aware of that.\n\n116\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.360\nAs a result, as an investigator,\nwe may have ample\n\n117\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.910\nopportunity to recover data that seemingly\nhas been removed from the system but\n\n118\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.240\nn fact lives on in residual data caches,\nin log files, in temp files.\n\n119\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.550\nThere's just a host of various\nthings that we maybe looking at.\n\n120\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.210\nSo status and\n\n121\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.230\nlog files, all that information, those\nare kinds of things you wanna look at.\n\n122\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.970\nThat path for the MySQL database, if we\ninstall it a Windows system, I have it\n\n123\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.525\nhighlighted there in the notes for you,\ntypically program data, you'll see there.\n\n124\n00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:47.115\nMySQL, MySQL Server 5.n or\nwhatever the version would be, and\n\n125\n00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:47.955\nthat's where we would see it.\n\n126\n00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:49.495\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n127\n00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:52.525\nWe may or may not see it installed\nin that particular location,\n\n128\n00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:56.162\nbut you do want to know that that's likely\nwhere we're going to start looking.\n\n129\n00:05:56.162 --> 00:05:58.462\nIn addition, there's a lot of files and\n\n130\n00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:00.672\ndata that will be contained\nin the data directory.\n\n131\n00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:04.412\nWe have the databases, tables,\nfiles, all that stuff will be there.\n\n132\n00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:07.752\nBut I broke down for\nyou the most likely characters and\n\n133\n00:06:07.752 --> 00:06:09.022\nthe cast of characters we will see.\n\n134\n00:06:09.022 --> 00:06:13.772\nHave a list here, especially with\nregards to the files that will be in\n\n135\n00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:18.440\nthe status and information in the log\nfiles and the items that will be there.\n\n136\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880\nSo wanna go through that with you.\n\n137\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.330\nThe auto.cnf file is the server_uuid will\nbe found there, unique identifier for\n\n138\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.480\nthe file, or for the database, rather.\n\n139\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.910\nThink of this as being like the GUID for\nan object in Windows, right?\n\n140\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.740\nUnique identifier for the instance and\n\n141\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.580\nthat's gonna obviously\nalways be important.\n\n142\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.690\nSo we can reference that and make sure\nwe're finding the appropriate data for\n\n143\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.090\nthat particular instance.\n\n144\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.810\nSo, that file will be imported.\n\n145\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.240\nThe servers process ID or\n\n146\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.620\nPID file has the MySQL servers process\nIDs, all the information about that.\n\n147\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.330\nThat's obviously going to be valuable.\n\n148\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.440\nAnd then in the status and\n\n149\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.880\nlog files, we're gonna have this\namount of information here.\n\n150\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.975\nSo, you could see just as we kinda\nwalk down the list of files,\n\n151\n00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.000\nI'll let you peruse them for\na minute there,\n\n152\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.500\nkinda take them in cuz there's\na lot going on, on that list.\n\n153\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.740\nBut the ten files that\nare really gonna be valuable for\n\n154\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.320\nus, we wanna pay attention to.\n\n155\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.300\nThe PID file I talked about is there,\nnumber one.\n\n156\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400\nError log, you'll see that,\n.err, is there.\n\n157\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.456\nThe general query log, the binary log,\n\n158\n00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:16.010\nthe one with the binary\nlog index taken together.\n\n159\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.950\nThe log index lists all the binary logs,\n\n160\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.590\nbinary logs essentially\nthe change control log.\n\n161\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:27.600\nThat's where all the changes are being\nreferenced and are being documented.\n\n162\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.840\nAnd so we have to look at the binary\nlog in order to see the transactions in\n\n163\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.430\nthe system.\n\n164\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.030\nAnd the binary log index tells us how many\nlogs incrementally are being created for\n\n165\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.770\nthe binary logs to store all the data.\n\n166\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.930\nWe need to cross-reference both in order\nto forensically examine the system.\n\n167\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.840\nThe relay log, the relay log index, you'll\nsee that there, the events it described.\n\n168\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.860\nThe changes that occur in the database,\nalong with all of the available data.\n\n169\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.666\nPair those with the binary log\nwhich actually describes and\n\n170\n00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:54.807\ncontains all the events that\nare actually driving the change, and\n\n171\n00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.241\nyou have a complete record\nof all the information.\n\n172\n00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.618\nThat is taking place.\n\n173\n00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:02.340\nSo, we have all those,\nwe also have a relay log info file.\n\n174\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.120\nThat is a replication slave file that\nis gonna contain the information\n\n175\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.930\nof the relay log processing\non alternate systems.\n\n176\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.962\nSo, we have that down there at the bottom,\nwe have the master info file.\n\n177\n00:08:13.962 --> 00:08:17.810\nThis is, again, one of the replication\nitems that contains all\n\n178\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.160\nthe parameters you use to connect\nback to the master/slave.\n\n179\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.030\nThe idea would be that, if we had\nmultiple instances of the database,\n\n180\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.050\nwe're going to have copies\nthat are being created.\n\n181\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.410\nThese files towards the bottom of the list\nare going to be involved with managing and\n\n182\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.310\ndocumenting all the manipulation,\nmovement, and\n\n183\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.090\ncopying of that information so\nthat we can replicate it.\n\n184\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.320\nWe need to know that's happening or\nif we have errors.\n\n185\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.710\nWe need to understand why, so\nwe have a list of these files.\n\n186\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.250\nThe slow query log tells us about\ntext files, or rather, excuse me,\n\n187\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.390\nthe information in the text file that took\na long time or longer than it should, for\n\n188\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.350\nprocessing.\n\n189\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.930\nMay get an extra large batch file, or\nbatch command, that comes in that we have\n\n190\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.020\nto deal with, and this file would at\nleast give us an indication of that.\n\n191\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.001\nPerhaps a hacker looking to\nrun queries that are going to\n\n192\n00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.935\ndump large volumes of data,\nwould tip their hand, hypothetically, and\n\n193\n00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:06.932\ncreate entries that would show\nup in the slow query log.\n\n194\n00:09:06.932 --> 00:09:11.096\nBecause maybe they asked us to dump every\naccount record out of a million account\n\n195\n00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:14.840\nfile, and that's gonna take longer\nthan a traditional transaction.\n\n196\n00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.525\nWe'd see evidence of that and wanna\nknow that, so just keep that in mind.\n\n197\n00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.885\nWould be valuable, or\nat least potentially be valuable for\n\n198\n00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:24.575\nus to query, take a look at,\nsee what's going in there.\n\n199\n00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:27.885\nThe InnoDB storage engine is\nwhat's used for these log files,\n\n200\n00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:29.625\ntraditionally in MySQL.\n\n201\n00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:30.375\nInno, I-N-N-O DB.\n\n202\n00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:35.625\nAnd we have a little guideline and\ninformation here.\n\n203\n00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:42.530\nThe MySQL InnoDB storage engine, hands-on,\nOwner's manual for the current version.\n\n204\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.950\nThis is released 5.7.\n\n205\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.510\nAgain you maybe seeing this and by that\ntime who knows we're up to 5.8, 6.2.\n\n206\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.780\nI don't know what what we would be up to,\nbut obviously they iterate these releases\n\n207\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.900\nevery so often I pulled the most recent\ndocumentation for the current version\n\n208\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.770\nas we're shooting the show, so the URL\nin the show notes will reflect that.\n\n209\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.720\nSo if you go there and\nit looks kind of weird,\n\n210\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.020\nand it's not chapter 14 any more, chapter\n14 is something else, you know why.\n\n211\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.000\nCheck the version number and\njust adjust accordingly.\n\n212\n00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.940\nNo big deal, but If you're\ninterested in taking a look there,\n\n213\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.910\nthis'll give you the information about the\nstorage engine, we have the undue logs and\n\n214\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.880\nthe redo logs, they'll be found\non the storage engine, and\n\n215\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.330\nwe just wanna make sure we\nhave a general sense of that.\n\n216\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.160\nAnd the permanent table records,\nIB Data 1 is gonna be used\n\n217\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.110\nas one of the places where we\nsee the permanent table records.\n\n218\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.620\nAnd there's just reference to all\nthis kind of stuff, the table spaces,\n\n219\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.680\nthe architecture.\n\n220\n00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.640\nTalks a bit about the concepts for\nInnoDB overall.\n\n221\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.430\nIt's a good general background, again,\nif you're familiar with MySQL and\n\n222\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.410\nthe open SQL databases,\nyou probably have a background with this.\n\n223\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.500\nIf you're not, no big deal,\nbut it's just a primer.\n\n224\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.450\nIt'll give you a little more background,\ngive you a little bit more,\n\n225\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.620\na little bit more of general\nfoundational knowledge.\n\n226\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.130\nCertainly more than adequate\nto prepare you for the exam.\n\n227\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.930\nNot suggesting that you need to read\nthrough this help file, just for\n\n228\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.980\npurposes of the exam, but\n\n229\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.330\nif you want to be more comfortable with\nwhat the back end storage architecture\n\n230\n00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.480\nlooks like, this'll be that primer that\nwill help you to understand those.\n\n231\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.410\nClick through the appropriate links,\nof course.\n\n232\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.710\nThe other thing we wanted to spend\na couple of minutes on here.\n\n233\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.260\nLittle bit of hands on piece I\nmentioned we would take a look\n\n234\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.350\nat how to do a little SQL\nlite database browsing.\n\n235\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:23.720\nSo I've got the SQL lite SQL or SQL\nlite database browsing tool right here.\n\n236\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.010\nLet me just show you this real quick.\n\n237\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.940\nAlways try to bring that up\nthe DB browser for SQL lite.\n\n238\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.730\nAll right so\n\n239\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:35.260\nthis is just a tool that we will often use\nin the forensics examination of databases.\n\n240\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.420\nAnd it's a pretty straightforward one,\nas interfaces go, right?\n\n241\n00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.290\nDo we have a new database,\nopen an existing one?\n\n242\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.660\nGo ahead, we'll open that database\nup just on the desktop here.\n\n243\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.780\nI have a folder with some SQLI\ndatabases that are just sitting there\n\n244\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.890\nwe can pull in.\n\n245\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.460\nSo we can go in and\ngrab one or more of these.\n\n246\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.570\nSo for instance,\nif I wanted to take a look at Accounts.\n\n247\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.620\nLoad that one up and we can see here,\nwe're reading the structure of\n\n248\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.170\nthe database and we're able to\nsee the tables that are here.\n\n249\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.890\nWe're able to see the indices.\n\n250\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.345\nCan we just go full screen, just so\nwe can see a little bit not only more\n\n251\n00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:16.159\nSpecifically see what is back behind me\nthere but also see it in a little bit of\n\n252\n00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:19.641\nan easier without having kind\nof a better resolution, why?\n\n253\n00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:24.168\nSo, we've got accounts table here and\nyou could see we could open that up and\n\n254\n00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:26.230\nsee information about it.\n\n255\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.200\nRight so we can see what may be\nof interest to us the ID the name\n\n256\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.460\nthe type the password\ninformation if we have what\n\n257\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.590\nkind of database it is if it's Android or\nyou know coming from a device in other\n\n258\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.790\nwords this may be coming\nfrom an Android device.\n\n259\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:48.080\nWe've got Just some general information\nas I kind of just click around in here\n\n260\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.950\non the various tables.\n\n261\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:54.750\nEach table has information associated\nwith it that gives us some insight or\n\n262\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.220\narching information that may be\nhelpful as we start to query and\n\n263\n00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.460\nlook at some of these,\ncertainly the table IDs, the account IDs.\n\n264\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.830\nThings of that nature.\n\n265\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.840\nAnd we can see As we take a look\nthat there's nothing really\n\n266\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.380\nvery interesting in the database\nstructure, but perhaps in the browse data.\n\n267\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.490\nWe can see that this does show us\nthat there are two accounts or\n\n268\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.240\ntwo types of accounts\nhere from a WhatsApp app.\n\n269\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.570\nSo this is information coming\noff of a mobile device.\n\n270\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.870\nAnd it's showing us a little bit, whoops.\n\n271\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.170\nShowing us a little bit about that,\n\n272\n00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.870\njust pulling that over,\ngot some password, hashes here, right?\n\n273\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.870\nSome strings that we maybe able to use\nto find the password associated with\n\n274\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.060\nvarious apps and or\nthe information that's there.\n\n275\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.070\nSo, browse the database,\nhelps us to understand what's going on.\n\n276\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.920\nSee some valuable information.\n\n277\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.300\nWanna open up the different database and\nby the way We could just pull this down\n\n278\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.840\nyou could see accounts, we can see any of\nthe tables here, and just pull in, right?\n\n279\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.000\nSo this is, looks like the metadata ENUS,\nENUS meaning it's an English.\n\n280\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.550\nEntries of the data will be be in English,\nso it's good to know the language so\n\n281\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.960\nthat we just pull in the tables here, and\nkind of just literally walk through them.\n\n282\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.420\nHere's the extra table,\nnot a lot, nothing in grams but\n\n283\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.640\nmay be in meta, it may or\nmay not be All right so\n\n284\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.070\nyour can see right there just don't appear\nto be very much data initially in this\n\n285\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.410\nfirst database but if give me some very\nimportant stuff told me it's an english\n\n286\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.350\nshowed me two accounts and showed me\nthe apps it with password attached.\n\n287\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.330\nNow if I cross reference with the rainbow\ntable exert I can begin to go pick those\n\n288\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.850\nhashes apart perhaps find the password for\nthose user accounts that alone.\n\n289\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.200\nMaybe valuable if you want to get into\nWhat's App on this device I could debunk\n\n290\n00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.190\nthat information in that database and\nmay be able to break in there and get in.\n\n291\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.900\nRight, so that alone would be taking some\nhacking, some forensics, kind of combine\n\n292\n00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.270\nthe two together and giving us the output\nof that hybrid that would be able to then\n\n293\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.470\nallow us to see and understand more\nlikely what's going on in there.\n\n294\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.460\nLet's take a look at one\nof the other databases.\n\n295\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.900\nLet's go in,\nMaybe take a look at downloads, right?\n\n296\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:05.420\nSo in the downloads area looks\nwe've got some urls here, right?\n\n297\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.314\nSo we can see some urls information,\nmay may not be valuable.\n\n298\n00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:18.020\nWe have let's see here Database structure.\n\n299\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.380\nSo, again, coming from a mobile device,\n\n300\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.370\nit's where we're taking this from,\njust getting some basic information.\n\n301\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.910\nLet's see if there's any\nrequest header data.\n\n302\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.640\nDoesn't appear to be, all right?\n\n303\n00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.960\nSo not too much in this one but\nif we take a look at, let's say\n\n304\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.220\nBrowser, browser too, and\nwe look at bookmarks.\n\n305\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.933\nWe can see all sorts of staff.\n\n306\n00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:48.029\nWe actually have web information.\n\n307\n00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:51.052\nWe got urls and\nall the stuff that is being accessed, so\n\n308\n00:15:51.052 --> 00:15:52.900\nthat I can literally go in.\n\n309\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.928\nAnd I can see all sorts of\nstuff that's been used here.\n\n310\n00:15:55.928 --> 00:15:57.940\nGoogle, Picasso, whatever it is.\n\n311\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.850\nAnd I can go grab those actual URLs,\nright?\n\n312\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.400\nAnd I can actually interact with them, or\njust go resolve and find out what's there.\n\n313\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.300\nWho needs to go dump the web cache?\n\n314\n00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.450\nI'll dump the contents\nfrom the app database.\n\n315\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.520\nAnd I'll find all that stuff.\n\n316\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.850\nIt's sitting in there, right?\n\n317\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.080\nSo I'm actually looking\nat that right here.\n\n318\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.560\nI may be able to go in and\nlook at the history.\n\n319\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.857\nThere's a history of all\nthe stuff that I went to and\n\n320\n00:16:17.857 --> 00:16:19.362\nhow I'm finding all that stuff.\n\n321\n00:16:19.362 --> 00:16:21.407\n&gt;&gt; That could be good information there?\n\n322\n00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:23.861\n&gt;&gt; That could also make for some\nexplanations that may be uncomfortable\n\n323\n00:16:23.861 --> 00:16:25.096\ndepending on where you've been.\n\n324\n00:16:25.096 --> 00:16:27.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what you've been doing, right?\n\n325\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.278\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna need to know why\nyou're visiting the Silk Road.\n\n326\n00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:32.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why have you been going in there?\n\n327\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.080\nWe do see that sync is enabled,\nso we are syncing this device.\n\n328\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.760\nAgain, mobile device,\nwe'll get the database from it.\n\n329\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.040\nAndroid based, as you can see,\nmay be valuable, may or\n\n330\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.240\nmay not be a valuable piece of information\nper se, but from our perspective, some\n\n331\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.410\nforensic investigator would be wanting\nto know if that device is being synced.\n\n332\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.500\nHey, where's that data going to?\n\n333\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.950\nWhat machine am I connecting to?\n\n334\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.330\nWhere's that other data source?\n\n335\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.260\nLet's cross reference that sync data\nwith what I have in the database.\n\n336\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.480\nLet's make sure that stuff's accurate,\nand if it is,\n\n337\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.180\nI know I got some pretty\ngood accurate information.\n\n338\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.470\nThat alone could be valuable, so\ngot some interesting stuff here.\n\n339\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.950\nThumbnails, right, if there's any,\nwhoops, if there's any thumbnails,\n\n340\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.870\nmay or may not be thumbnails.\n\n341\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.640\nLooks like there's one, so I may be able\nto reconstruct some thumbnails, right?\n\n342\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.493\nMay or may not be able to do that.\n\n343\n00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:22.839\nLet's take a look at message store.\n\n344\n00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.210\nI have some different messages here,\nright, so you can see.\n\n345\n00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.600\nCreation IDs, information about when\nthe message was sent and received.\n\n346\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.240\nSo I could take a look at that.\n\n347\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.968\nSo again, I'm getting the raw data,\nbut I'm able to go in and\n\n348\n00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:37.880\nactually find this information.\n\n349\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.570\nAll I'm doing is using just a tool\nthat lets me view the database.\n\n350\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.490\nI'm just reading\nthe structure of the tables.\n\n351\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.640\nBut by going in, pulling this data,\nI'm now being able to create a lot more\n\n352\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.780\ninterest and\nunderstanding of what's been going on.\n\n353\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.790\nAnd I can start to create some interesting\nobjects, what we call artifacts,\n\n354\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.060\nthat I can put into my reporting\nabout this particular system.\n\n355\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.990\nAnd I could this with\nalmost any database table.\n\n356\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.360\nI'm just using sample databases that I've\ncreated and just have available here.\n\n357\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.860\nBut I could do this with any tool or\nany set of databases,\n\n358\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.670\nrather, using a tool like this.\n\n359\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.120\nJust a SQL-like database tool,\nor database viewer.\n\n360\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.010\nSo keep in mind that when we're doing this\nwe are going in, grabbing that database\n\n361\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.430\ninformation, reading the rows inside the\ntable, understanding the data structure.\n\n362\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.250\nWe found some pretty interesting and\nvaluable things.\n\n363\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.820\nI mean imagine being able to reproduce the\nURLs, the search history, the contacts,\n\n364\n00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.410\nthe messages that have been sent by an app\nlike WhatsApp, for instance, right?\n\n365\n00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.541\nI mean, we often joke around about,\nhey, what are you doing in there?\n\n366\n00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.570\nWanna see what's going on?\n\n367\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.940\nBut dumping the databases from\na mobile forensics standpoint\n\n368\n00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.920\nallows me to link this knowledge to the\nmobile forensics conversation that will\n\n369\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.210\ncome up a little later.\n\n370\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.781\nAnd we've seen the database portion, the\nbackend portion, on the mobile forensics.\n\n371\n00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:50.638\nThe idea of getting the image\nfrom the mobile device,\n\n372\n00:18:50.638 --> 00:18:55.212\nright, using a forensically sound mobile\nediting platform, and then taking that,\n\n373\n00:18:55.212 --> 00:18:58.959\nand then using the database forensics\nthought process and mindset and\n\n374\n00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:03.590\ntool set to read the databases, allows\nme to combine those two skills together.\n\n375\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.640\nAnd now I've actually got the ability\nto be able to detail what's sitting\n\n376\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.450\non that mobile device.\n\n377\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.990\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, databases, obviously,\n\n378\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.070\nlike we've talked about are just a part\nand parcel of our everyday lives.\n\n379\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.250\nThey're hooked to just about everything.\n\n380\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.740\nIf you're messing around\non the web at all,\n\n381\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.620\nthey're almost guaranteed that you're\ntouching a database of some sort.\n\n382\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.630\nSo for us being able to work\nwith databases, understand\n\n383\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.400\nat least the basic foundations and\nunderstand their basic interoperations and\n\n384\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.100\nhow they work, just at that level, so that\nwe can extrapolate information out of them\n\n385\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.880\nto tell that story in\na forensically sound way.\n\n386\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.900\nThat's gonna help us out\na lot in the long run.\n\n387\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.520\nWe do thank you, Adam, for\nshowing us how we can do that and\n\n388\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.220\na lot of neat stuff that's available for\nus so that we can do that.\n\n389\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.880\nThat being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of our episode.\n\n390\n00:19:48.880 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.166\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.470\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.927\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we're moving forward,\n\n6\n00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:21.735\nwe're moving on.\n\n7\n00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:26.004\nPicking up the pace with more on our CHFI\nversion 9 series, and joining us yet\n\n8\n00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.950\nagain our mentor, our guiding star along\nthis journey, our friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.580\nAdam, glad to have you back, man.\n\n10\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you very much.\n\n11\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.050\nAlways glad to be here\nspending time with you and\n\n12\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.450\ntalking about all things forensics.\n\n13\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.500\nToday we're gonna spend some time\ntalking about, or at least get into,\n\n14\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.665\nthe initial points of the conversation\naround cloud and cloud forensics.\n\n15\n00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:48.768\nYet another interesting and exciting\narea linking this, if you think about\n\n16\n00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:53.576\nthe conversations we would've had in prior\nepisodes, to the web and web applications,\n\n17\n00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:57.551\nand forensics there, and even along\nthe lines of a lot of the other areas,\n\n18\n00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:01.950\nthe operating system, the network\nforensics conversations we've had.\n\n19\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.790\nThese are all gonna be areas contributed\nto the thought process of the cloud and\n\n20\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.910\ncloud forensics.\n\n21\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.855\nBut we have to obviously concede control\nand give access and potentially management\n\n22\n00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.460\noversighting and capabilities to perhaps\na third party as we run the cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.641\nAnd will talk about the specificity of\nthat kind of a conversation as we get\n\n24\n00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.640\nstarted here.\n\n25\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.540\nSo if you're gonna jump right in and\njoin me,\n\n26\n00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.550\nwe're gonna move right\nover here to this machine.\n\n27\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.300\nWe're gonna take a look at the standing\ndefinitions that we have to have and\n\n28\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.190\nuse as our baselines for\nour cloud computing.\n\n29\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.140\nThis comes to us from NIST, the NIST\ndefinition of cloud computing document.\n\n30\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.420\nSP for special publication, 800-145.\n\n31\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.106\nThis is the small, the as we say,\nversion of a bigger document,\n\n32\n00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:48.270\nSP 800-146, which is about 80 to 90\npages in length, much, much broader.\n\n33\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.080\nBut this is the condensed, executive\nversion that gives us the beginning\n\n34\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.070\nbuilding blocks, really just\nthe definitional criteria that we need.\n\n35\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.120\nAnd of these pages, really its gonna be\n\n36\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.650\npage number six and\nseven that are gonna be of interest to us.\n\n37\n00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.400\nYou could see here in this\ndefinition of cloud computing,\n\n38\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.870\nwe're gonna talk about the central\ncharacteristics of cloud really quickly.\n\n39\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.240\nWe're gonna focus on the accepted\nservice models, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.\n\n40\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.600\nWe're gonna talk about the deployment\nmodels, private, public, hybrid, and\n\n41\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.720\ncommunity cloud.\n\n42\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.240\nThat's what we're gonna spend time on, at\nleast the beginning of this conversation.\n\n43\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.910\nLet me zoom in here just a little bit so\nwe can see that.\n\n44\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.480\nAnd if we could take a look at this, we'll\nstart with the essential characteristics\n\n45\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.322\nof cloud and\nwe can see the five of them listed here.\n\n46\n00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:38.880\nOn-demand self-service,\nbroad network access,\n\n47\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.810\nresource pooling, rapid elasticity,\nand measured service.\n\n48\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.400\nLet's start with on-demand self-service.\n\n49\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.100\nThe idea of on-demand self-service\nis that a user, as it says there,\n\n50\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.880\na consumer is a user essentially,\n\n51\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.485\nsame idea, can unilaterally\nprovision computing capabilities.\n\n52\n00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:59.193\nIn other words, an individual can,\non their own, be able to go in and\n\n53\n00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:03.662\nmake a request and fill out whatever\nform may be needed on the web or\n\n54\n00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:05.955\nwhatever interface we provide.\n\n55\n00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:08.843\nAnd request an indeed provision and\nspin up one or\n\n56\n00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:12.610\nmore cloud instances allocating\nresources to them as needed.\n\n57\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.620\nYou clearly would have\nto be a paying customer,\n\n58\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.550\nyou would have to be a member of the\ninternal organization that runs the cloud.\n\n59\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.472\nIn other words,\nyou have to be a legitimated user.\n\n60\n00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:25.168\nBut the idea would be that, if we do allow\nfor self-service, that you should be able\n\n61\n00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:28.741\nto interact with the system and\nprovision resources on demand,\n\n62\n00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:33.731\nmeaning at your own pace, through your own\ncapabilities if you're an authorized user.\n\n63\n00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.295\nFirst key criteria of the cloud.\n\n64\n00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:39.109\nBroad network access,\nthe system, the cloud,\n\n65\n00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.819\nshould be available from any\nauthorized and accepted channel,\n\n66\n00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.858\nand we should be able to\naccess it from any platform.\n\n67\n00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.133\nAs you could see, thick or thin,\nmobile phone, tablet, laptop,\n\n68\n00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.580\nand workstation,\nin other words, ubiquitous.\n\n69\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.795\nIt's available all the time.\n\n70\n00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.235\nDan, and you actually said this in\none of our earlier shows, right?\n\n71\n00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.215\nIt's available all the time.\n\n72\n00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:57.760\nIt's always there, it's always on.\n\n73\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.130\nRight, that's the good\nthing about the Internet.\n\n74\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.560\nIt's also potentially the bad thing about\nthe Internet when we talk about the web.\n\n75\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.000\nSo we wanna think about that.\n\n76\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.960\nResource pooling, we have four resource\ncategories we often focus on and\n\n77\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.330\nthink about with regards\nto cloud computing.\n\n78\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.370\nAnd virtualization,\nthe underlying technology that enables\n\n79\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.970\ncloud computing to be as\nmassively scaled as it is today.\n\n80\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.020\nI often tell my customers,\ntalk to my students about this,\n\n81\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.790\nespecially when I do VMWare classes,\nthings like that.\n\n82\n00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.440\nThat we can have the idea of\ncloud as we know it today,\n\n83\n00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.590\nin the commercial space, massively\nscaled multi-tenant environments.\n\n84\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.070\nThe Google, the Amazon, the Azure\nfabrics of the world that we talk about.\n\n85\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.400\nWe could not have that\ncloud capability and\n\n86\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.000\nthose cloud platforms\nwithout virtualization.\n\n87\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.725\nWe can do cloud without virtualization\non a very limited, small scale,\n\n88\n00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:48.865\nwithout massive scalability.\n\n89\n00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:52.575\nYou could create fixed-asset\ninfrastructure that runs the cloud.\n\n90\n00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:54.075\nIt doesn't have to be virtualized.\n\n91\n00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.285\nBut it cannot be scaled massively.\n\n92\n00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:59.815\nWe could do virtualization without\nthe cloud, cuz virtualization is\n\n93\n00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:03.585\nthe underlying technology that does enable\nthe cloud, the way we think of it today.\n\n94\n00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:05.105\nBut we could break the two apart.\n\n95\n00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.750\nWe could have virtualization and\nyou do, right?\n\n96\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.470\nAll the time without using it for cloud\ncapabilities and purposes, but we really\n\n97\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.100\ncan't envision the cloud the way we think\nof it today without virtualization.\n\n98\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.389\nSo it's become that enabling technology,\nand as a result, the idea of resource\n\n99\n00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.362\npooling is the idea of taking the four\nresource groups we often think of when\n\n100\n00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:27.866\nwe think of virtualization in the cloud,\nmemory on our host, so RAM, CPU, right?\n\n101\n00:05:27.866 --> 00:05:32.127\nThe ability to be able to execute\nthrough multiple cores or CPUs.\n\n102\n00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.800\nStorage, massive storage arrays and\nnetworks.\n\n103\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.204\nAnd network, massive pipes and access.\n\n104\n00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:41.592\nAnd we pull those resources together\nallowing them to feed these cloud forms\n\n105\n00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.760\nand these cloud environments.\n\n106\n00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.678\nWe talked at some point\non one of our shows,\n\n107\n00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.110\nI forget which one,\nabout the idea of the matrix, right?\n\n108\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.623\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That analogy\n\n109\n00:05:48.623 --> 00:05:49.560\nabout-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n110\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.950\n&gt;&gt; whether they would investigate\nthe knowledge in our heads and\n\n111\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.850\nthat whole idea.\n\n112\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.050\nIf you think about the traditional vision,\nor\n\n113\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.230\nthe scene we see in the Matrix where Neo\nwakes up and realizes what the matrix is.\n\n114\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.510\nAnd he was actually shown\nwhat the Matrix is.\n\n115\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.753\nAnd is shown this,\nnot the where he's sitting with\n\n116\n00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:12.240\nMorpheus's having the conversation\nin the Barcaloungers, right?\n\n117\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.350\nBut then when he actually\nshows him the real vision.\n\n118\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.900\nAnd he shows him the power plants and the\npeople that are essentially driving this.\n\n119\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.165\nAnd you'll have babies are just\nplugged in to become d batteries.\n\n120\n00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is the vision.\n\n121\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.870\nThat's resource pooling\non a massive scale.\n\n122\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.630\nNot suggesting we're going there yet,\nbut simply throwing it out there.\n\n123\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.941\nYou never know, it could be the future.\n\n124\n00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:31.513\n&gt;&gt; Let's hope not.\n\n125\n00:06:31.513 --> 00:06:33.059\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, hey, look,\n\n126\n00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.274\nthey all look pretty happy.\n\n127\n00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:35.605\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you don't know.\n\n128\n00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:38.910\n&gt;&gt; There's the philosophical debate for\nthe day, ladies and gentlemen, go for it.\n\n129\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, I forget the character actor's\nname who plays the character, but-\n\n130\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.120\n&gt;&gt; He played Cipher.\n\n131\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Right well, yeah, he played Cipher.\n\n132\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.440\n&gt;&gt; He said, ignorance is bliss.\n\n133\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.220\n&gt;&gt; Well he says, yeah, he says,\nI wanna go plug me back in.\n\n134\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.670\nSteak tastes like this.\n\n135\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.540\nJust plug me back in.\n\n136\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.040\nI don't care.\n\n137\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.270\nIgnorance is bliss.\n\n138\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.500\nWhen he's having that dinner with.\n\n139\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.360\n&gt;&gt; Agent Smith.\n\n140\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.200\n&gt;&gt; Agent Smith.\n\n141\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.780\nSo you think about that and\nyou don't know sometimes.\n\n142\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.310\nWho knows?\nFor\n\n143\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.570\nall you know we could all be\nliving right now in the matrix.\n\n144\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.370\nThis could all be a dream.\n\n145\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.470\nWe may not be doing this for real-\n&gt;&gt; Which is why that was so\n\n146\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.780\nentertaining and fun to watch.\n\n147\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.780\n&gt;&gt; It was, it was great, the original one.\n\n148\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.130\nIt got a little wacky there towards\nthe end and that whole thing.\n\n149\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.970\nBut the very first one, it was-\n&gt;&gt; So much fun.\n\n150\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Really cool, right?\n\n151\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.146\nAnd good music too, rather.\n\n152\n00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:23.243\nAnd the good use of the,\nwhat do you call it?\n\n153\n00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:24.454\n&gt;&gt; The 360 cameras or whatever?\n\n154\n00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:27.006\n&gt;&gt; No, well that too some of\nthe fight scenes, no, but\n\n155\n00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:30.318\nthe jacket that Neo wears at the end\nwhere he's flying in the air.\n\n156\n00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:32.701\n&gt;&gt; The trench coat\n&gt;&gt; Yes the good trench coat.\n\n157\n00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:35.510\nWhen he's flying and doing all that cool\nstuff, and of course the sun glasses.\n\n158\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.660\n&gt;&gt; Yaeh.\n&gt;&gt; You can't say enough good things\n\n159\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.220\nabout sunglasses.\n\n160\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.930\n&gt;&gt; He was rocking.\n\n161\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.930\n&gt;&gt; He was, he was [LAUGH] all right so,\nlet's get back, rapid elasticity, right,\n\n162\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.960\nso we've got resource pooling,\npooling them together,\n\n163\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.460\nrunning in multi-tenant farm environments,\nwhat about rapid elasticity here?\n\n164\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.540\nThe idea of being able to scale up,\nscale out, scale down.\n\n165\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.774\nPeople often forget the fact that,\nfor every activity where we scale up,\n\n166\n00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.296\nat some point we lose that demand.\n\n167\n00:07:56.296 --> 00:07:59.795\nWe may wanna shut things off to\nconserve energy, power capabilities.\n\n168\n00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:04.431\nWe may scale up, we also may scale down So\nscaling up, scaling out, scaling down,\n\n169\n00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:08.608\nrapid bringing of resources to the fore\nand allowing them to be deployed for\n\n170\n00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:11.310\nour benefit is what we talk about here.\n\n171\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.520\nAnd then we're talking about\nmeasured services, metrics,\n\n172\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.300\ncan't say enough important things about\nhow we have to measure everything.\n\n173\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.050\nWe have to measure it\nbecause you pay as you go.\n\n174\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.610\nThink about the concept of the cloud,\n\n175\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.920\nat least in commercial\nenvironments anyway, right?\n\n176\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.090\nWe're paying for service, if we can't\nmeasure it, we can't charge you.\n\n177\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.088\nAnd as a result, we gotta measure\neverything, so we know what to charge you,\n\n178\n00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:33.179\nso that way, you pay for\nthe appropriate [CROSSTALK].\n\n179\n00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.883\n&gt;&gt; Well, and on the flip side of that,\nif you can't measure it,\n\n180\n00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.450\nyou can't say that I\nused that resource for\n\n181\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.542\nx amount of time, right, or\nthat I got what I'm paying for, yeah.\n\n182\n00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:47.092\n&gt;&gt; But we also can't hold ourselves,\nor the customer cannot hold us,\n\n183\n00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:49.870\nif we are the CSP,\nthe cloud service provider.\n\n184\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.100\nWe cannot hold each other accountable\nunder an SLA, a service-level\n\n185\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.030\nagreement framework, with regards to the\ncapabilities we're supposed to deliver and\n\n186\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.010\nthe consumption we're supposed to be\nentitled to on the service level.\n\n187\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.006\nSo there's lots of reasons\nwhy we need to measure.\n\n188\n00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:03.980\n&gt;&gt; Very beneficial.\n\n189\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.230\n&gt;&gt; Very important, absolutely.\n\n190\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.610\nSo we go from the five defining essential\ncharacteristics of the cloud down,\n\n191\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.040\nif you would join me back here,\nto the service models.\n\n192\n00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.860\nI've gotta talk about these.\n\n193\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.720\nNow, I'm gonna do these in reverse order.\n\n194\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.810\nSo I'm gonna bypass SaaS and PaaS for\na moment, come down here to IaaS.\n\n195\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.110\nSo I'm gonna go in reverse order.\n\n196\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.250\nI'm gonna start at the bottom and\nwork my way up.\n\n197\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.250\nBecause we start with the base\ninfrastructure when we're talking about\n\n198\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.400\nlaying out this foundational\nthought process.\n\n199\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.070\nThen we add the platform,\nwhich is the IDE, the Integrated Dev and\n\n200\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.980\nOS Environment.\n\n201\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.584\nAnd then the software, the apps that\nwe're gonna top on top of them.\n\n202\n00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:36.125\nAnd if you think about them that way,\n\n203\n00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:38.540\ntends to be a little bit\neasier to understand.\n\n204\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.195\nAlso, I wanna point out and\nstress here, very important,\n\n205\n00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:47.165\nthat there are many as-a-service offerings\nthat exist out there in the world today.\n\n206\n00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:47.935\nWho knows how many?\n\n207\n00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:49.315\nHard to say, don't really know.\n\n208\n00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:51.525\nHonestly, not really important\nto put a number on them, but\n\n209\n00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:52.865\njust to know that they're out there.\n\n210\n00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:57.695\nThere's dBase, right, database as\na service, there's C-Cast, security as\n\n211\n00:09:57.695 --> 00:10:02.515\na service, there is XaaS, essentially\neverything, anything as a service.\n\n212\n00:10:02.515 --> 00:10:04.880\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nthat exist out there.\n\n213\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.110\nBut we may not all agree on\nthe definitions of what they are,\n\n214\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.386\na lot of these offerings may be vendor\ndriven, and therefore, proprietary.\n\n215\n00:10:12.386 --> 00:10:15.805\nThey may be silo and\nare vertical specific, and as a result,\n\n216\n00:10:15.805 --> 00:10:18.270\nthey're not universally accepted.\n\n217\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.061\nThe only three as-a-service offerings\nthat are universally defined,\n\n218\n00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:25.851\nuniversally accepted, and are tested\non and asked about and therefore,\n\n219\n00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:30.251\nwe should be aware of, are the three in\nthis document, infrastructure, platform,\n\n220\n00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:31.870\nand software as a service.\n\n221\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.360\nThat's why we're going through them.\n\n222\n00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.570\nSo I don't want you to think that\nany of the others are not valuable.\n\n223\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.380\nI just want you to make this\ndistinction in your mind and\n\n224\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.350\nunderstand the logic of it,\nthat we don't spend time on them,\n\n225\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.620\ncuz we can't agree on what they mean,\nwhereas these are universally accepted.\n\n226\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.360\nHaving said that,\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n227\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.840\nthis is where we are going to the cloud\nprovider, can you help me out here?\n\n228\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.889\nCan you be our cloud service provider,\nor CSP?\n\n229\n00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.766\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I will provide cloud for you.\n\n230\n00:10:56.766 --> 00:11:01.970\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go to danielcloud.com,\nand I want to get some infrastructure.\n\n231\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.700\nI need to get from Daniel's\ncloud service provisioning.\n\n232\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.400\nI need to be able to\nget ten host computers,\n\n233\n00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.430\ncuz I wanna run a bunch\nof virtual machines.\n\n234\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.303\nI need to rent this infrastructure.\n\n235\n00:11:12.303 --> 00:11:15.320\nAnd this is the underlying assumption and\nthought process of the cloud.\n\n236\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.450\nI'm gonna rent this.\n\n237\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.758\nI don't wanna go out and\ninvest money and buy it.\n\n238\n00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:22.030\nI don't wanna rack and stack it,\nlike you see behind me here.\n\n239\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.420\nAnd own it, I don't wanna have to\ndeprecate it for five years and\n\n240\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.942\nthen worry about maintaining it.\n\n241\n00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:30.109\nI wanna be able to essentially pay\nsomebody to do all that for me,\n\n242\n00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:33.170\nI'm gonna push all that work\nload right over there to Daniel.\n\n243\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.061\nAnd he's gonna take it on for me and\n\n244\n00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.442\nwhat he's gonna get in return is a whole\nbig heap of my money, right, [LAUGH] so.\n\n245\n00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:40.221\n&gt;&gt; I will take that as well.\n\n246\n00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.205\n&gt;&gt; Gonna say,\nI'll take everything you got.\n\n247\n00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:43.140\nRight, give me it all,\nbut I want some money.\n\n248\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.049\n&gt;&gt; I don't care how much you have,\nI want it all.\n\n249\n00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:46.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just give me money,\n\n250\n00:11:46.264 --> 00:11:49.307\ninsert the credit card,\nlet's start the conversation, right?\n\n251\n00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:53.147\nSo, I am gonna trade, and\nessentially, push over the risk,\n\n252\n00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:58.157\nthe liability, and all that goes with it,\nto Daniel to run it all and give it to me.\n\n253\n00:11:58.157 --> 00:11:59.427\nAnd he's gonna say, Adam, no problem.\n\n254\n00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.127\nBut for a certain amount of money, you\nget a certain amount of infrastructure.\n\n255\n00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:03.790\nSo we're gonna have that conversation.\n\n256\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.210\nSo I ask is all about what kind\nof infrastructure am I getting?\n\n257\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.580\nPhysical servers somewhere\nare gonna exist that underly\n\n258\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.480\neverything we do in the cloud.\n\n259\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.890\nThere are rows, acres,\nfarmlands filled with server warehouses,\n\n260\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.110\nright, where we see rack and stack gear\nthat a cloud provider's invested in.\n\n261\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.640\nWe see power infrastructure,\nwe see networks,\n\n262\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.370\nwe see storage, we see CPUs, we see RAM.\n\n263\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.425\nWe see all that stuff cuz that's what\nwe need, right, so massive scalability,\n\n264\n00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:37.280\nright, and the ability to be\nable to bring that to bear.\n\n265\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.850\nSo I'm gonna go to Daniel and say,\nDaniel, I need ten physical servers.\n\n266\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.360\nI want each one to have 128 CPUs.\n\n267\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.909\nI want 128 CPU cores, I want each\none to have ten network adapters.\n\n268\n00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:56.216\nI want six of those adapters to be\nfiber HBAs with 40 gig fiber cards.\n\n269\n00:12:56.216 --> 00:13:01.291\nAnd I want four to be 10 gig, right,\nso I want multi-speed access,\n\n270\n00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:05.948\nI want them to have access to\na petabyte of storage each, right?\n\n271\n00:13:05.948 --> 00:13:08.050\nAnd I don't have a lot of needs, right?\n\n272\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.850\n&gt;&gt; No, no, simple set up here.\n\n273\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Simple set up, right?\n\n274\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.790\nAnd I want there to be four terabytes\nof RAM in each of those hosts, right,\n\n275\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.840\nso some massive hosting.\n\n276\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.430\n&gt;&gt; You could become your own\ncloud provider off of that.\n\n277\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.010\n&gt;&gt; I could become my\nown country with that.\n\n278\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, geeze.\n\n279\n00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:25.865\n&gt;&gt; I'm building the ultimate gaming and\nstreaming server, right?\n\n280\n00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:28.270\nSo that's what I say to Daniel, I want.\n\n281\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.805\nDaniel says okay, Adam,\nwell, I could do that.\n\n282\n00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:35.055\nLet me do some quick calculations, gonna\ncost you an arm and a leg every month.\n\n283\n00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:39.285\nNo problem, I got a warehouse full\nof arms and legs, let's get started.\n\n284\n00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.835\nSo Daniel's gonna rent that to me.\n\n285\n00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:45.458\nHe, as the cloud provider, is gonna go\nout and provision all these servers,\n\n286\n00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:46.923\ngonna set them up physically.\n\n287\n00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:49.139\nSo they're all gonna be allocated\nif he already has them, or\n\n288\n00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:52.017\nhe's gonna reposition or repurpose them,\nor he's gonna go out and buy them.\n\n289\n00:13:52.017 --> 00:13:54.921\nI don't care what he does, again,\nI'm the cloud customer, I could care less,\n\n290\n00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:56.012\nI don't wanna know.\n\n291\n00:13:56.012 --> 00:14:00.012\nI just wanna know that when I log in to\nthe web API interface you give me, right,\n\n292\n00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:02.642\nto be able to access all of this,\nit's all there.\n\n293\n00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.090\nThat's all I wanna know.\n\n294\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.287\nSo as the cloud customer, I don't have\nto worry about maintaining the servers.\n\n295\n00:14:08.287 --> 00:14:10.815\nI don't have to worry about setting\nthem up, I don't have to worry about\n\n296\n00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:13.060\nthe power consumption,\nI don't have to cable them up.\n\n297\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.420\nDaniel does all that.\n\n298\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.000\nBut at the same time, there's\na responsibility matrix here, right?\n\n299\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.790\nWho gets to do what?\n\n300\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.878\nWell, Daniel's doing\nall the heavy lifting.\n\n301\n00:14:20.878 --> 00:14:24.288\nI'm paying Daniel to do that,\nthat's fine, but as the cloud customer,\n\n302\n00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:25.670\nwhat's my responsibility?\n\n303\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.547\nIn the IAS model, I have to take\nthat hardware he's provisioned, and\n\n304\n00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:33.637\nnow I have to configure it, load it,\nset it up, and actually operate it.\n\n305\n00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:37.095\nBecause Daniel's not giving it to\nme loaded with operating systems.\n\n306\n00:14:37.095 --> 00:14:39.750\nDaniel's not configuring it for me-\n&gt;&gt; Not doing pass management or\n\n307\n00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.409\nanything like that.\n\n308\n00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:42.345\n&gt;&gt; Not doing any of that,\ncuz I didn't say I want him to do that.\n\n309\n00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:45.055\nWe're gonna get to that up in the stack,\nin pass and sass.\n\n310\n00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:46.550\nBut I didn't say I want that.\n\n311\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.465\nI just said look,\n\n312\n00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:51.515\nI want the bulk hardware, and I wanna\nhave control over loading the OSes.\n\n313\n00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:54.460\nI gotta license them, I'm responsible for\ndoing that as the customer.\n\n314\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.490\nI gotta configure them,\nI gotta network them, right?\n\n315\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.540\nI gotta link them together,\ndo whatever I wanna do.\n\n316\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.670\nI built my domain,\nI gotta install my domain controller.\n\n317\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.910\nI'm doing all that,\nI gotta manage all that.\n\n318\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.460\nDaniel's not gonna be involved with that.\n\n319\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.010\nBut as the cloud customer,\nwhat don't I see?\n\n320\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.220\nWhat don't I have access to?\n\n321\n00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.870\nPhysical security in the data center,\nI have no control over that,\n\n322\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:13.590\nthat's all Daniel.\n\n323\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.080\nI have nothing to say about that.\n\n324\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.004\nAnd even if I wanted to,\n\n325\n00:15:16.004 --> 00:15:18.660\nthere's nothing I can do because\nI don't own the infrastructure.\n\n326\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.970\nI don't even know where it is probably,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n327\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.223\nI access it all through web interfaces,\nsome sort of remote control capability\n\n328\n00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:29.330\nthat's given to me through a web API or a\nremote desktop session or whatever it is.\n\n329\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.600\nI don't know physically where it is.\n\n330\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.590\nI only know logically how to get to it,\ndoesn't really mater.\n\n331\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.670\nSo physical security is gonna be\nthe purview of the cloud provider and\n\n332\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.910\nthe IS, and in the past and\nthe sass model, by the way.\n\n333\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.870\nDoesn't change, that's always a baseline.\n\n334\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.900\nThe actual maintenance of the hardware,\nright, that's all Daniel.\n\n335\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.079\nThe data center overheats and\nthe hardware melts down, that's his fault,\n\n336\n00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:48.880\nnot mine, right?\n\n337\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.407\nBecause I'm not involved with that.\n\n338\n00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:54.295\nActually racking and stacking the gear,\nplugging in hard drives, adding storage,\n\n339\n00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:58.021\ndoing all that stuff, cabling stuff up,\nthat's all done by the cloud provider,\n\n340\n00:15:58.021 --> 00:15:59.054\nby Daniel, not by me.\n\n341\n00:15:59.054 --> 00:16:02.650\nI have no control over any of that as\na customer, nor do I want it, right?\n\n342\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.920\nBut then as a result, I don't see\nthe architecture of the cloud environment.\n\n343\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.970\nI only see what I'm being shown in my\npiece in the multi-tenant environment.\n\n344\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.640\nThe isolation, the physical and logical\nsecurity associated with isolating my gear\n\n345\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.280\nfrom everybody else's, that's all Daniel,\nI have nothing to do with that.\n\n346\n00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.510\nI don't see that, I don't know anything\nabout if it's done the right way.\n\n347\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.920\nLogging on the physical servers,\n\n348\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.490\nlogging on the storage array,\nlogging on the network security for\n\n349\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.150\nmonitoring, packet traffic,\nall that stuff, all done by the provider.\n\n350\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.730\nI have nothing to say about any of that.\n\n351\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.895\nSo, it's very heavily imbalanced in the\nresponsibility matrix as we look at it,\n\n352\n00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:42.970\ncuz Daniel essentially spins\nup the hardware, walks away,\n\n353\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.820\nand says, okay, Adam,\nI did my little piece down here.\n\n354\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.520\nAll the other stuff you gotta\ndo to stack and run that, or\n\n355\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.980\nrather to install and run that.\n\n356\n00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.028\nThat's all being done by you, right?\n\n357\n00:16:52.028 --> 00:16:56.110\nSo it's a very imbalanced matrix when we\nlook at IaaS because the provider has very\n\n358\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.920\nbasic responsibilities and\nthen walks away.\n\n359\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.890\nPlatform is a serve.\n\n360\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.740\nSo lets walk up one level\nin the cloud model.\n\n361\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.420\nPast, platform is a service,\neverything I do with IaaS, I get all that.\n\n362\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.700\nSo I still say to Daniel, here's my\nwishlist for all my hardware but,\n\n363\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.070\nby the way, I want you to load\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu or\n\n364\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.100\nDebian or Windows Server 16 or\nwhatever on every one of those instances.\n\n365\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.510\nAnd by the way,\nI'm not licensing and paying for it.\n\n366\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.710\nYou're providing the licenses,\nMr. Provider.\n\n367\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.540\nBut Daniel's smart, no problem, Adam.\n\n368\n00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.610\nIt's gonna cost you an extra $150\na month cuz he's passing the licensing\n\n369\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.700\nessentially over to me as part\nof the incorporated cost.\n\n370\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.700\nI'm paying for it,\nI'm just renting it month by month, right?\n\n371\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.370\nSo, you pay for everything.\n\n372\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.028\nLet's make this clear,\nno free lunches, right?\n\n373\n00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:39.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No free lunches.\n\n374\n00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.839\n&gt;&gt; You want everything,\nthere's a price, right?\n\n375\n00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:42.700\n[LAUGH] Just a matter of what you want,\nit's all a la carte.\n\n376\n00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Cloud can be,\n&gt;&gt; You pay for everything.\n\n377\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.045\n&gt;&gt; Cloud can be a cheaper lunch,\nbut it's not free.\n\n378\n00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:47.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean it could be cheaper\n\n379\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.740\ndepending on what you do.\n\n380\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.770\nMaybe as nutritious or more nutritious.\n\n381\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.\n\n382\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.330\n&gt;&gt; But it is gonna cost you.\n\n383\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.590\n&gt;&gt; As delicious though.\n\n384\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.890\n&gt;&gt; As soylent green, right,\nsoylent green, right.\n\n385\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.530\n&gt;&gt; It's people.\n\n386\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.626\n&gt;&gt; It's people,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:17:57.626 --> 00:17:58.422\n&gt;&gt; Another great movie, right,\n\n388\n00:17:58.422 --> 00:17:58.928\nCharlton Heston.\n\n389\n00:17:58.928 --> 00:18:01.090\nProbably one of the better movies,\nit's either that or Omega Man.\n\n390\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:01.810\n&gt;&gt; I love Omega Man.\n\n391\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.500\n&gt;&gt; Two classic movies.\n\n392\n00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Planet of the Apes obviously is\namazing, I love Planet of the Apes.\n\n393\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.090\n&gt;&gt; We talked about that.\n\n394\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.010\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me going.\n\n395\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.540\n&gt;&gt; The original Planet of the Apes.\n\n396\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, original Planet, that's right.\n\n397\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.492\n&gt;&gt; Not the new stuff\nthey've done recently,\n\n398\n00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:16.770\nthat's garbage compared to the original.\n\n399\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.740\nYou wonder why that stuff happens.\n\n400\n00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.675\nWhy do you mess with stuff?\n\n401\n00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:25.710\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Hollywood's become a bottom line\ncompany, right, bottom line business.\n\n402\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.800\nThey got a formula that says x\namount of people will go to watch\n\n403\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.930\na remake of Planet of the Apes.\n\n404\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.720\nI digress, cloud, cloud,\nthat's the problem.\n\n405\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.540\n&gt;&gt; You testify to the truth.\n\n406\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.180\nThat is important.\n\n407\n00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.590\nSo paths, let's talk about paths.\n\n408\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.350\nSo as we were talking, so\nnow we're stepping up one level.\n\n409\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.580\nResponsibility's roughly\ngonna be split equally here.\n\n410\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.620\nDaniel's got more work to do.\n\n411\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.710\nHe's gotta load and configure all\nthe OSs', he's patch managing and\n\n412\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.330\nmaintaining the hardware and the OSs'\non my behalf, I don't control them.\n\n413\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.190\nI load the ID, the integrated dev and\n\n414\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.840\nhosting environments on top,\nI run my app stack on top.\n\n415\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.230\nBut Daniel provides half\nthe infrastructure, and\n\n416\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.790\nI roughly manage the other\nhalf as the cloud customer.\n\n417\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.300\nSo I'm responsible for\nthe virtual machines running on top.\n\n418\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.320\nI have to patch manager those.\n\n419\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.380\nDaniel controls the base OS and probably\nis involved with managing that aspect cuz\n\n420\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.670\nhe's configuring it as\nthe cloud provider impasse.\n\n421\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.180\nAnd then when we go to SaaS, Software\nas a Service, top of the stack, right?\n\n422\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.149\nWe get IaaS, we get PaaS,\nnow we're getting the application running\n\n423\n00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:28.020\nthe workloads on top when I am doing that\nI've got two traditional SaaS models.\n\n424\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.320\nI could rent an individual\npiece of software.\n\n425\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.938\nThink Microsoft's Office\n365 product line and\n\n426\n00:19:33.938 --> 00:19:39.919\nthink I wanna rent as part of Office 365,\nI just want Microsoft Office 2016.\n\n427\n00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:43.830\nI want people to be able to download that\nonto every desktop in my organization.\n\n428\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.930\nFor $5 bucks a month I\nget the right to rent\n\n429\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.670\nOffice 2016 is a productivity suite for\nevery user and I install it, right?\n\n430\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.795\nThat's one form a SaaS,\nSoftware as a Service.\n\n431\n00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:56.162\nThat's the ability to just rent software.\n\n432\n00:19:56.162 --> 00:20:00.199\nBut I also have what's called hosted SaaS,\napplications in the Cloud,\n\n433\n00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.160\nExchange Online, SharePoint Online.\n\n434\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.500\nLink, right now Skype for Business Online.\n\n435\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.420\nThose, the Azure Directory Services,\nAD in the Cloud, right?\n\n436\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.000\nThese are all Software as\na Service offerings, but\n\n437\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.550\nthey're hosted, Microsoft in this case.\n\n438\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:20.710\nOr think salesforce.com, the SaaS model\nonline for the CRM product, Salesforce.\n\n439\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.670\nThese are all applications that are hosted\nby a third party in their data centers.\n\n440\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.980\nAnd as the consumer, as the customer,\n\n441\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.530\nI have to worry about only two things,\nuser access control and management.\n\n442\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.600\nI provision users, put them into\nthe system, give them rights.\n\n443\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.810\nAnd upload my data and put it in there.\n\n444\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.660\nEverything else is done by the provider.\n\n445\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.860\nSo Salesforce manages everything else,\nMicrosoft manages everything else.\n\n446\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.500\nIf you do Office 365 with Exchange Online,\nyou don't back up your Exchange Servers.\n\n447\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.370\nYou don't even administer a nine-tenths\nof what goes on with them.\n\n448\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.540\nThe primary things you do\nis User Account Control.\n\n449\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.550\nYou create, delete, and modify users and\nassign them mailboxes, right?\n\n450\n00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.900\nAnd then you basically,\nafter that, set up some rules for\n\n451\n00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.820\nthings like DLPs,\nsome basic data loss prevention.\n\n452\n00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.560\nYou could do some basic e-discovery.\n\n453\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.110\nYou get some administrative capabilities\nbut it's all around data access and\n\n454\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.150\ndata management.\n\n455\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.980\nAll the other nine-tenths of that\nstuff we gotta do maintain Exchange?\n\n456\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.420\nYou don't see, you don't have access to,\nsame to go with SharePoint.\n\n457\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.820\nYou wanna run SharePoint online?\n\n458\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.030\nNo problem, create your users, set up\nyour sites, configure this and that,\n\n459\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.730\nset everything up and you're done,\nyou don't do anything else.\n\n460\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.950\nMicrosoft does it all, they maintain it,\nthey back it up, they archive your data,\n\n461\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.260\nthey do the upgrades to the platform,\nthey control everything, right?\n\n462\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.190\nSo, Daniel is the provider,\nis really busy, right?\n\n463\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.640\nWe're the exact opposite\nway we were in IaaS.\n\n464\n00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.320\nWhere the cloud provider\nwas doing minimal stuff and\n\n465\n00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.970\nthe customer was doing everything, now in\nSaaS the cloud provider is doing almost\n\n466\n00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.520\neverything, customer is doing\na very minimal amount of stuff.\n\n467\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.360\nSo we gotta understand the logic\nhere of the service models.\n\n468\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.400\nVery important for you to be able to\nfind them, understand the key to finding\n\n469\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.290\ncharacteristics of what we get,\nand who's responsible for what.\n\n470\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.580\nYou may be asked about these, right,\nso make sure you are away of them.\n\n471\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.480\nAnd finally our cloud deployment models,\nlet's come down here and\n\n472\n00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.690\ntake a look at those if we could.\n\n473\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.170\nWe have our private cloud, community\ncloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud.\n\n474\n00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.900\nMost people I talk to have certainly\nheard of private and public cloud,\n\n475\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.760\nthey can figure out hybrid, but most\npeople have not heard of community cloud.\n\n476\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.430\nIt's not a term that we often throw\naround and hear a lot about, so\n\n477\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.860\nI wanna throw that out there for you.\n\n478\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.640\nMake sure you're familiar\nwith this one as well.\n\n479\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.310\nSo the private cloud is the internal\nprivate network of yesterday,\n\n480\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.520\nof days gone by.\n\n481\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.860\nThe intranet,\n\n482\n00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.550\nthe internal private network,\nthat is what we now call private cloud.\n\n483\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.870\nWe're just rebranding it.\n\n484\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.210\nSkinny ties are coming back by the way.\n\n485\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.160\nSo are bolos right?\n\n486\n00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes they are.\n\n487\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.960\n&gt;&gt; So private cloud is just\nthe intranet of days gone by.\n\n488\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.690\nPrivate internal network,\nnow in this case, private internal cloud.\n\n489\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.500\nNow we can run this in one of two ways,\nhosted on-prem, hosted off-prem.\n\n490\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.740\nMicrosoft Office 365 could be your private\ncloud off-prem, and Microsoft Data Center\n\n491\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.870\nfor your messaging and\nenterprise content management platform.\n\n492\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.610\nWhen you're running on AWS,\nAmazon's Web Service,\n\n493\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.010\nyou're running your private cloud for\nyour company by hosting your web servers,\n\n494\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.590\nyour database, etc there,\nthat's hosted off-prem, private cloud.\n\n495\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.440\nBut you may choose to spin up\nyour own private cloud on your\n\n496\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.450\nown infrastructure in your own data\ncenter, that's on-prem private cloud.\n\n497\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.106\nDaniel and I and Cherokee and I would\nkinda split the load for this, did a whole\n\n498\n00:23:21.106 --> 00:23:26.500\nset of shows on the MCSE private cloud\ncontent, 7746 and 246 and 247, right?\n\n499\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.967\nYou did the SCOM.\n\n500\n00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:29.293\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of the monitoring and\n\n501\n00:23:29.293 --> 00:23:30.700\nall the management stuff with me.\n\n502\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.580\nAnd Cherokee did a lot of stuff on\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager and\n\n503\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.030\nthe cloud hosting pieces.\n\n504\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.830\nGot a whole lot of content out\nthere about how to set up and\n\n505\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.380\nmaintain private cloud on\nthe Microsoft platform.\n\n506\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.920\nWe've got some shows on VMware and\nhow VMware's\n\n507\n00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.080\nproducts are used to set up private cloud\non prem inside, in the ITProTV library.\n\n508\n00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.470\nLots of vendors offer\non-prem private clouds.\n\n509\n00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.890\nSo understand that.\n\n510\n00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.860\nPublic cloud, that's the Internet,\n\n511\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.390\nworld wide web that we've been\ntalking about forever and a day.\n\n512\n00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.067\nLargest example of a public cloud\nanywhere in the world, right?\n\n513\n00:24:00.067 --> 00:24:04.843\nSo just talking about a network that's\nubiquitously available from multiple\n\n514\n00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:05.645\nlocations.\n\n515\n00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:08.063\nPublic cloud, hybrid cloud.\n\n516\n00:24:08.063 --> 00:24:11.388\nCombine two of those cloud types together\nso we have both public and private,\n\n517\n00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:12.210\nlet's say.\n\n518\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.920\nWhere you may go to a site that has,\nlike Amazon is a great example of this,\n\n519\n00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.540\nthe Amazon e-commerce site, right?\n\n520\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.210\nYou go there, the public face of it where\nyou're just shopping without logging in,\n\n521\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.350\nthat's part of the public cloud.\n\n522\n00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.010\nYou're accessing it over the Internet.\n\n523\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.220\nWhen you access it through logging in,\nand then have your own account and\n\n524\n00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.280\nare browsing securely behind\nthe scenes and ordering,\n\n525\n00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.150\ninteracting with your\ndocumentary data as a customer,\n\n526\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.240\nyou're accessing the private cloud aspect\nof that site behind the scenes, right?\n\n527\n00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.290\nAnd that's what it is.\n\n528\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.860\nYou log into AWS, and you're accessing\nyour private cloud infrastructure.\n\n529\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.180\nBut you get to it through\nthe public cloud,\n\n530\n00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.170\nthrough the Internet in\norder to gain access to it.\n\n531\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.000\nSo we see hybrids all the time.\n\n532\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.500\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n533\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.599\nCommunity cloud is that kinda crazy off\nthe corner one people don't often define.\n\n534\n00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:59.012\nCommunity clouds, what I like to think of\nthem as are subsets of the private cloud.\n\n535\n00:24:59.012 --> 00:25:02.553\nBut they are unique and defined for\na certain interest group or\n\n536\n00:25:02.553 --> 00:25:05.060\na set of users that have special needs.\n\n537\n00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.204\nSo for instance, if we take out on-prem\nhosted private cloud in a business,\n\n538\n00:25:09.204 --> 00:25:10.520\nAcnecorp.com, right?\n\n539\n00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.330\nLet's just say, and\nin Acne Corp we have traditional silos.\n\n540\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.360\nWe have sales and marketing.\n\n541\n00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.030\nWe have HR.\n\n542\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.877\nWe have finance, things like that.\n\n543\n00:25:19.877 --> 00:25:24.397\nAnd let's say that the HR entity is\nusing our private Acne Corp cloud,\n\n544\n00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:26.240\nlike everyone else is.\n\n545\n00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.390\nThey get their email there and\nstuff like that.\n\n546\n00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.000\nBut then they come to us at some point,\n\n547\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.010\nus being the IT functionality\nof the business.\n\n548\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.880\nAnd they say, we have this additional need\nto be able to have a space where we can\n\n549\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.920\nrun our own HR application that's\nuniquely used in the company,\n\n550\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.930\nto be able to manage employees.\n\n551\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.110\nAnd we want to be able to\ntrack HR related stuff.\n\n552\n00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:51.278\nWe need a separate area of the cloud that\nis just gonna be dedicated to the HR\n\n553\n00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:52.299\nfunctionality.\n\n554\n00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:55.920\nWe could either to set up a separate\nprivate cloud, is what we would tell them.\n\n555\n00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.735\nOr we can carve off a community cloud,\nessentially create a secondary cloud\n\n556\n00:25:59.735 --> 00:26:02.893\nwithin the private cloud that is\njust gonna be given access to,\n\n557\n00:26:02.893 --> 00:26:04.217\nin this case the HR group.\n\n558\n00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:07.375\nSo that would a community cloud, a cloud\nthat is dedicated to the interests of\n\n559\n00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.720\na specific audience or group,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n560\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.820\nSo I just wanna make sure we\nunderstand the basic building blocks,\n\n561\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.875\nthe definitional criteria\nof the deployment models,\n\n562\n00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:20.460\nright, the service models, and the five\nessential characteristics of the cloud.\n\n563\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.700\nAs begin our journey into the cloud, cloud\ndefinitions are critical to our ability to\n\n564\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.820\nengage in forensics, as we have to use the\nlanguage and terminology the right way.\n\n565\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.460\nSo we understand that we're investigating\nunder a certain service model\n\n566\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.780\nwith some sort of thought process around\nwhat that may mean, who's responsible for\n\n567\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.220\nwhat, in that respect.\n\n568\n00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.190\nSome sort of deployment model,\nis it private, is it public?\n\n569\n00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.178\nWhat are the central characteristics,\nare they being met?\n\n570\n00:26:44.178 --> 00:26:45.560\nIf not, why not?\n\n571\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.160\nThese are things we would wanna know about\nand make sure we're comfortable with.\n\n572\n00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.020\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n573\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.760\nWell, it looks like there's a lot of\ninformation when it comes to the cloud.\n\n574\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:58.190\nA lot of people is still, even to this day\nare a little bit fuzzy, a little hazy on\n\n575\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.900\nwhat the different cloud services are, the\ndifferent cloud miles, the deployments.\n\n576\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.800\nNow you should have a very good\nfoundational knowledge on what that is so\n\n577\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.250\nthat as we continue the conversation on\nlooking at attacks to the cloud-based\n\n578\n00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.940\nnetworks, and then forensics that are\ninvolved in detecting those attacks and\n\n579\n00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.420\nthings of that nature, well,\nthat'll be a little bit easier for\n\n580\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.960\nyou to understand and digest.\n\n581\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.740\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n582\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.120\nAnd we're gonna have to roll\ninto of our famous part twos,\n\n583\n00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.030\nso we'll see you back there for that one.\n\n584\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.630\nAs for this,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n585\n00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.440\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\n\n586\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.066\nDaniel Lowry\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n587\n00:27:32.066 -->

00:00:28.590\nAdam, glad to have you,\nman, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.030\n&gt;&gt; Cloudy with a chance of knowledge.\n\n12\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've been working on that all morning\n\n13\n00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.405\nactually.\n\n14\n00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:35.500\nIt's going well, hopefully it's\ngoing well for all of you out there.\n\n15\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.020\nOr all of you out there.\n\n16\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020\nOr wherever you are,\nas we start looking at cameras and\n\n17\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.170\ntalking, what we're gonna do is\njump back into cloud forensics.\n\n18\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.400\nWe left off in our last conversation we\njust laid down the foundational elements.\n\n19\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.756\nWe put out the knowledge\nfrom the NIST cloud overview\n\n20\n00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:53.583\ndefinitions document SP 800-145.\n\n21\n00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:57.655\nTalked about some of the characteristics\nof Cloud, the cloud service models,\n\n22\n00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:59.296\nthe cloud deployment models and\n\n23\n00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:03.020\nwent through the logic of what it means\nto actually operate in the cloud.\n\n24\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.720\nFoundational knowledge, very important for\n\n25\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.160\nus as we think about security and\ncertainly in this case in particular,\n\n26\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.630\nthink about forensics with\nregards to the Cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.270\nBut we should jump back in and\ncontinue talking about\n\n28\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.260\nthe next kind of layer of knowledge\nthat we have to build on top, and\n\n29\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.580\nnow that we know what the Cloud is, how\nit's made up, what constitutes a cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.980\nWhat kind of activities take place and\nwho's responsible for\n\n31\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.450\nthose activities as we talked about.\n\n32\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.620\nWe have to think about how we now turn our\nattention towards attacks in the cloud.\n\n33\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.610\nAnd cloud computing attacks,\nyou know a lot of times people think,\n\n34\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.460\nwell it's the cloud, there must be\nsignificant differences, there must be\n\n35\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.750\na different methodology, perhaps\na different set of tools, techniques, and\n\n36\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.440\ntherefore attacks and, in some respects,\nyes, there definitely are differences.\n\n37\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.090\nWe've talked about the heavy\nreliance on virtualization.\n\n38\n00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.060\nNot today by any means, that that is\na difference cuz we heavily rely on\n\n39\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.905\nvirtualization both inside and outside of\nCloud environments as we've discussed, but\n\n40\n00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:59.905\nthe unique nature of the cloud's\nresponsibility matrix\n\n41\n00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:04.375\nwhere we split up and distinguish between\nDaniel, our service provider, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.431\nDual role, and Adam our customer, as we\ntalked about in our last episode, and\n\n43\n00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.220\nwho will be responsible for what?\n\n44\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.890\nWhereas in traditional on prem,\ntraditional hosted models that involve\n\n45\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.086\nsimply a company with an IT function,\nmanaging and maintaining the majority of,\n\n46\n00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:25.208\nif not all of there own infrastructure,\neven in those early models who would have\n\n47\n00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:30.213\nhad a little bit of outsourcing to third\nparty's for bandwidth for instance.\n\n48\n00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:33.995\nRight, traditionally you'll buy\nbandwidth in access to the Internet,\n\n49\n00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.472\nin access to dedicated network\ncircuits from a third party vendor,\n\n50\n00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.050\nthat's just traditionally how it's done.\n\n51\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.230\nVery rare that a company has the capacity,\nthe capability,\n\n52\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.160\nthe resources, the technology, and\nthe tools to lay their own cables, and\n\n53\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.720\nto own their own pathway end-to-end.\n\n54\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.528\nYou'll cable your building, but the last\nmile out the street, so to speak, and\n\n55\n00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:57.160\nout to the rest of the world\nis owned by other companies,\n\n56\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.520\nthat's just traditional how it's done.\n\n57\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.490\nSo unless you are in a very small\n\n58\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.040\nspecific set of circumstances where\nyou own your own dedicated pathways,\n\n59\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.550\nmicrowave, short relay kind of situations\nwhere you're doing line of sight\n\n60\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.260\ntransmission between remote buildings,\nand you own that infrastructure,\n\n61\n00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.710\nyou're piggybacking on somebody else's\nnetwork, and we have been for a long time.\n\n62\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.030\nSo, in that respect, we certainly still\nsee that there are other parties involved,\n\n63\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.705\nbut we tend to, in those scenarios,\nreally focus on the internal understanding\n\n64\n00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:32.775\nthat through the use of cryptography,\nsecure transmission protocols,\n\n65\n00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:37.315\nwe can apply what we would traditionally\nsay have been robust safe guards,\n\n66\n00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:41.905\nif done correctly, against data tampering\nand against data modification and\n\n67\n00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:46.505\neven data snooping on somebody else's\nnetwork, on the wire as we say.\n\n68\n00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:51.230\nAnd so as a result, we will consider that\nbox checked-off as long as we monitor and\n\n69\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.600\nas long as we use overlay protections like\nintegrity mechanisms so we would encrypt,\n\n70\n00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.860\ndigitally sign,\nas well as use integrity checks.\n\n71\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.480\nHashing our data, whether it's e-mail or\n\n72\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.895\njust traditional bulk data going back and\nforth,\n\n73\n00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:10.640\nand by doing that, we'll consider that to\nbe a fairly robust set of protections,\n\n74\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.410\neven on the open transmission mediums of\nthe Internet and the world wide web today.\n\n75\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.760\nSo with cloud, what we really see\nthe distinction as being is not\n\n76\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.560\nwe're using brand new technology\nwe've never seen before.\n\n77\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.150\nThere may be some of that, but\nwe're really doing primarily and\n\n78\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.530\nreally where the differentiation occurs,\n\n79\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.840\nis whose hands are on the levers,\nwho's responsible for physical and\n\n80\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.040\nlogical security, at what phase, and\nat what area of the data life-cycle?\n\n81\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.400\nData on the wire, data at rest,\n\n82\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.810\ndata in use, traditional three phases\nof the life-cycle we talk about.\n\n83\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.950\nData on the wire is transmission back and\nforth, data in use in the application\n\n84\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.800\nstack, in the web stack,\ndata in storage, or data at rest,\n\n85\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.910\ndata on a back end network somewhere\non a NAS, network attached storage,\n\n86\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.300\non a SAN, storage area network system,\nlocal attached storage, or\n\n87\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.535\ndirect attached storage,\nyou hear referred to different ways.\n\n88\n00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:10.007\nWhatever it is,\nthose are the key focal points.\n\n89\n00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:12.515\nKey areas, of course,\nwith regards to management of data.\n\n90\n00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:16.028\nAnd when we bring in the third\nparty is that Daniel's, right,\n\n91\n00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:20.407\nwho are the Internet service providers,\ncloud service providers in our prior\n\n92\n00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.856\ndiscussion in our last episode\nin that example that Daniel and\n\n93\n00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:27.198\nI walked through for SaaS,\nPaaS and IaaS responsibility.\n\n94\n00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:32.398\nWhen we think about that, we are thinking\nabout the fact that we're seeing,\n\n95\n00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:37.198\nat a minimum, some sort of splits\nprobably at the low end in the IS area,\n\n96\n00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:40.430\nheavily weighted in favor of the customer.\n\n97\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.750\nHow many do the majority,\nof the set up and\n\n98\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.720\nsort out the ongoing management of\nthe use of that platform in the past\n\n99\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.520\ntrajectory or\nrather in the past platform, right?\n\n100\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.810\nSo when we're thinking of stepping up\nfrom infrastructure, adding the OS, and\n\n101\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.680\nthen splitting that responsibility,\nprobably 50-50 or\n\n102\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.760\nclose to it, between the provider and\nthe customer.\n\n103\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.880\nAnd as we go all the way to the top\nof the stack in the service models,\n\n104\n00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.240\nwith SaaS, we're thinking about, again,\ninverting that, going the other way.\n\n105\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.680\nThe customer bears almost no\ndirect responsibility for\n\n106\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.500\nmanagement and for\noversight and for monitoring.\n\n107\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.930\nBut rather the provider does the majority\nof that, as we said, the customer would\n\n108\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.910\nreally traditionally bear\nresponsibility for two distinct areas.\n\n109\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.160\nWe would see user account management\ncreation, modification, and\n\n110\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.880\ngranting or restricting of\naccess controls to the data,\n\n111\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.020\nto the web front end through the APIs,\nto the use of the application.\n\n112\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.370\nAnd we see that we are responsible for\ndata and data management,\n\n113\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.860\nwe're putting data into the system,\nwe're removing it from the system.\n\n114\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.300\nBut we're essentially doing those things.\n\n115\n00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.010\nThe provider does everything else.\n\n116\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.650\nAnd so,\nwhen we think about the differences and\n\n117\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.310\ntherefore the attack vectors, a lot of\nthem, are gonna be the same that we\n\n118\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.380\nthink of and see in traditional\nmodels when we think about the Cloud.\n\n119\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.055\nAnd this is something people often miss.\n\n120\n00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:01.370\nCuz the bulk of what we do,\nis very similar.\n\n121\n00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.190\nIt's just a question of who's doing\nit as opposed to what we're doing.\n\n122\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.140\nAnd that's the key pivot point,\nthe distinction that we want to\n\n123\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.470\nthink about from a forensics mindset,\nfrom a security provider mindset.\n\n124\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.710\nWe have to have that as we\nbegin the conversation really\n\n125\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.730\nvery specifically embedded there,\nfront and center in our thought-process,\n\n126\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.950\ncuz we have to make sure that we are\noperating with the correct assumptions and\n\n127\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.640\nthat we're taking the right\napproach in viewing the data and\n\n128\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.630\nthe perspective of what\nthat information may mean.\n\n129\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.250\nFrom the right angle, or\nwith the right thought process in mind.\n\n130\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.089\nSo, clock computing attacks,\nservice hijacking,\n\n131\n00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.528\nusing things like social engineering.\n\n132\n00:07:38.528 --> 00:07:39.086\nWe're going to masquerade.\n\n133\n00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:39.971\nWe're going to spoof.\n\n134\n00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:40.575\nWe're going to redirect.\n\n135\n00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:42.180\nWe're going to shoulder surf.\n\n136\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.880\nWe're going to steal your credentials.\n\n137\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.830\nWe're going to brute force, dumpster dive.\n\n138\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.790\nAll these things are part of any or\nall of that.\n\n139\n00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.718\nSession hijacking using XXS,\nremember cross site scripting.\n\n140\n00:07:52.718 --> 00:07:56.686\nDaniel helped us walk through the\ndifferences with cross site scripting and\n\n141\n00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:59.048\ncross site request forgery and\nthe 26 other\n\n142\n00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:00.405\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:01.462\n&gt;&gt; issues and concerns that\n\n144\n00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.323\nwe threw out there.\n\n145\n00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:04.495\nProbably our longest list or one of them,\nI would think that we've created, right?\n\n146\n00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:08.637\nBut we walk through all the different\nconcerns around acting and\n\n147\n00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:12.699\nopportunity costs, and\nthings that may go right or wrong, and\n\n148\n00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:17.857\nattacks that can happen, in the web, and\njust extending that out to the cloud.\n\n149\n00:08:17.857 --> 00:08:19.225\nRight, so we went through that.\n\n150\n00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:22.790\nIf you remember that conversation,\nthe web application and\n\n151\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.270\nweb hacking solutions that we talked\nthrough in the forensics on the web\n\n152\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.620\nepisodes would be where\nyou would go to see that.\n\n153\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.900\nWe spend probably at least two or three\nepisodes developing that thought process,\n\n154\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.460\ngoing through all the attacks and\n\n155\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.280\nconcerns that may occur based around\nthe OWASP Top 10 list, if you remember.\n\n156\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.310\nAnd we built out on that and added\na lot more depth to that conversation.\n\n157\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.990\nDNS attacks, always there,\nalways prevalent,\n\n158\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.810\nalways somewhere, whenever we mention\nthe web, whenever we mention the cloud.\n\n159\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.410\nSQL injection attacks, and injection\nattacks overall, mentioned those,\n\n160\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.210\nwent through them.\n\n161\n00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.900\nWrapping attacks, talked about that.\n\n162\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.330\nSession hijacking using network sniffing,\nin the network OS or network and\n\n163\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.120\nOS forensics episodes that we've done,\nif you haven't seen them,\n\n164\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.870\ndefinitely take the time,\ngo back and take a look.\n\n165\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.150\nWe talked extensively about the issues and\nconcerns associated with not encrypting,\n\n166\n00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.520\nand not using secure\ntransmission protocols.\n\n167\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.100\nEspecially in the network forensics area,\nwhere we're exposing data, and therefore,\n\n168\n00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.763\nallowing and\n\n169\n00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:23.575\nhiding the possibility that a bad actor\nwould be able to grab credentials.\n\n170\n00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:26.757\nYou've mentioned before,\nwe've talking the angle about things\n\n171\n00:09:26.757 --> 00:09:29.580\nlike the use of Tellnet and\nwhy that could be so bad.\n\n172\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.330\nSNMP version 1 versus version 3.\n\n173\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.150\nSSL V1 versus SSL V3, and\n\n174\n00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.350\nin theory should be TLS,\nas opposed to SSL these days, right?\n\n175\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.670\nMaking good choices, planning to be\nsecure, v ersus planning to allow\n\n176\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.500\nsomeone to find out those credentials, are\nall these kind of things we think about.\n\n177\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.660\nSession riding attacks,\nside channel attacks.\n\n178\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.390\nThe one thing that's probably unique to\nthe cloud environment that we have to be\n\n179\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.710\nconcerned about, and this is a unique\nspecific thought process to cloud.\n\n180\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.119\nFrom the attack perspective,\n\n181\n00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:04.216\nfrom the forensics perspective\nis this issue of multi-tendancy.\n\n182\n00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:08.013\nThe idea of having multiple\nindividual companies or\n\n183\n00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:14.064\nentities sharing commonly in pooling their\nback end resources from the provider.\n\n184\n00:10:14.064 --> 00:10:18.732\nAnd using common networks, common\nresourceful, although there is logical,\n\n185\n00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:21.550\nand in some cases, physical separation.\n\n186\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.840\nYou could pay extra, in other words,\nfor dedicated hosting,\n\n187\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.630\nbut you're still running\non common storage, and\n\n188\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.640\ncommon carrier networks in\nthe data center and beyond.\n\n189\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.750\nSo there is a certain point\nwhere all that traffic merges,\n\n190\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.550\nall those resources come together.\n\n191\n00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.400\nRemember, one of the five\nessential characteristics,\n\n192\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.540\ndefining characteristics of the cloud,\nright?\n\n193\n00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.430\nResource pooling, so remember that we\ntraditionally are in shared environments.\n\n194\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.319\nAnd as a result of this,\nthough it is unlikely,\n\n195\n00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:51.874\nthough it is usually not something\nwe're concerned about, provided that\n\n196\n00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:56.594\nthe provider has done their job,\nthey exercised due care and due diligence.\n\n197\n00:10:56.594 --> 00:11:02.153\nBut VM escape or VM hopping, VM guest\nattack to VM guest, that kind of thing,\n\n198\n00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:07.471\nbecause we have such a high density,\nand such a high consolidation rate.\n\n199\n00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:10.662\nSo many systems are running, so\nmany virtual instances, guest\n\n200\n00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:15.360\noperating systems, VMs, whatever you refer\nto them as, they all mean the same thing.\n\n201\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.410\nWe've got a bunch of VMs\nrunning on a set of hosts.\n\n202\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.200\nAnd if company A, company B, and company\nC, are all running on that same set of\n\n203\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.170\ninfrastructure, in theory there is\na possibility that VMs from company A,\n\n204\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.250\nB, or C could interact with each other\neven though they're not supposed to.\n\n205\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.960\nIsolation can be broken,\neither by accident or on purpose.\n\n206\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.780\nA bad actor could get into one machine,\nand\n\n207\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.920\nhop over those containment\nfences into other systems.\n\n208\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.450\nAnd again, while it is unlikely,\nit is not impossible.\n\n209\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.370\nThere is evidence to\nthe fact they can occur.\n\n210\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.430\nWe have seen these attacks occur,\nand they will continue to occur.\n\n211\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:58.169\nBecause at a certain point, if bad choices\nare made, just common sense Security 101.\n\n212\n00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:00.627\nYou don't put on VLAN identifiers, so\n\n213\n00:12:00.627 --> 00:12:04.780\nthat traffic is logically as\nwell as physically isolated.\n\n214\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.927\nYou don't use virtual firewalls, and\nsoftware to find routing stacks,\n\n215\n00:12:09.927 --> 00:12:14.576\nand security stacks, but\nrather you rely on human intervention,\n\n216\n00:12:14.576 --> 00:12:18.245\nmanual configuration,\nas opposed to automation.\n\n217\n00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:21.236\nWhen and where possible and\ncontinuous monitoring,\n\n218\n00:12:21.236 --> 00:12:25.100\nthen we may run into issues where\npeople just plainly make mistakes.\n\n219\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.883\nRight, they just make bad configuration\ndecisions, and when they do that,\n\n220\n00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:32.680\nwe're gonna propagate that out, and\nthat could lead to a compromise.\n\n221\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.810\nWhat if in the,\nlet's say platform as a service model,\n\n222\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.080\nversus the IaaS,\ninfrastructure as a service model.\n\n223\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.450\nThe patch management, whether it's\nthe provider that's doing it in PaaS or\n\n224\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.660\nthe customer that's doing it in IaaS\nof the core OS on the host and,\n\n225\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.390\nor on the VMs that are running.\n\n226\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.380\nBecause depending on what we're talking\nabout, it may be the provider, and or\n\n227\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.930\nthe customer that has to do that.\n\n228\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.670\nBut either way,\nif we're talking about the host and, or\n\n229\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.630\nwe're talking about the guest\nVMs on top of the host.\n\n230\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.350\nWhen we do patch management, if we don't\nkeep up the patching on those, let's say,\n\n231\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:15.460\nWindows boxes as hosts or, let's say,\nVMware boxes as host, CSXi, right?\n\n232\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.567\nAnd then our Windows VMs or Linux VMs,\ndoesn't matter what they are,\n\n233\n00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:22.352\nwe're not patching on a consistent basis,\nand\n\n234\n00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:26.549\neveryone around us is, our VMs,\nour host may be vulnerable to attack.\n\n235\n00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:31.324\nAnd if ours are attacked through a DoS or\nDDoS environmental solution,\n\n236\n00:13:31.324 --> 00:13:36.490\nwhere somebody comes after us, and\nattempts to knock our systems down.\n\n237\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.200\nCould they have a cascading\neffect on other VMs,\n\n238\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.360\nother hosts in that infrastructure?\n\n239\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.460\nYeah, if the provider is not able\nto cut that attack off quickly, and\n\n240\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.990\nrespond immediately,\nwe may become the initial target,\n\n241\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.260\nbut collateral damage may take out\nhuge swaths of the data center.\n\n242\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.420\nWe may effect other companies we're\nnot even planning on effecting, or\n\n243\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.700\neven had knowledge of.\n\n244\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.730\nBut because of the propagation\neffect of that attack, and\n\n245\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.050\nthe ability to suck resources out of\nthe host, because of a DDoS attack,\n\n246\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.220\nwe may actually take down\ncollateral infrastructure.\n\n247\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.690\nSo they're definitely are some differences\nin the cloud that we have to account for\n\n248\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.760\nand, as a result, as investigators,\nwe have to be thinking about this, right?\n\n249\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.482\nBecause, was the target of the attack\ncompany A that got nailed right there,\n\n250\n00:14:20.482 --> 00:14:21.947\nVM's were taken down?\n\n251\n00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:23.700\nOr was it your company C, and\n\n252\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.376\nwe just went after company A as a way to\nmake it look like it wasn't company C,\n\n253\n00:14:28.376 --> 00:14:32.929\nto hide that activity, even though we\nreally wanted to target company C?\n\n254\n00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:36.946\nThis is devious, dastardly,\ndark stuff, right, I understand that.\n\n255\n00:14:36.946 --> 00:14:42.000\nBut, the reality is sometimes the best\n\n256\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.550\noffence when we're out there trying to do\nthese bad deeds is to hide in plain sight,\n\n257\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.440\nand make it look so obvious that, it was\nsomething else that nobody bothers to\n\n258\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.640\nlook, right, and\nreally think about what possibilities are.\n\n259\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.450\nWe have to be smarter as investigators,\nright?\n\n260\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:02.120\nWe have to be the ones that say, hey,\nas crazy as this sounds, right, as just\n\n261\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.550\nout there wackadoodle as it is, that's\na technical term by the way, wackadoodle.\n\n262\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.860\nIt's right up there with, what was\nthe other one you gave me yesterday?\n\n263\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.490\n&gt;&gt; Ridonculous.\n\n264\n00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Ridonculous,\nyes it's up there with ridonculous, right?\n\n265\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.706\nSo, when we think about just how crazy and\noutlandish this may be,\n\n266\n00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:22.345\nwe see this, not all the time but\nwe certainly hear a lot about this idea.\n\n267\n00:15:22.345 --> 00:15:26.587\nWhere you eliminate every possibility, and\nas crazy and ridiculous and out there as\n\n268\n00:15:26.587 --> 00:15:30.289\nthe only other option is, is usually\nthe one that winds up being the case,\n\n269\n00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:32.425\nbecause it's the only one that's left.\n\n270\n00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:36.830\nAnd so you do have to be open to the ideas\nof the investigator, that sometimes,\n\n271\n00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.910\nit's not the obvious thing staring you\nin the face, but it's the thing that's\n\n272\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.825\ntotally ridiculous and\nnot obvious that was the intended target.\n\n273\n00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.966\nBut what I am suggesting is\na balance here, [LAUGH] right?\n\n274\n00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:47.765\nYou gotta tether yourself to reality.\n\n275\n00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:52.739\nYou don't go looking, right, for ghosts,\nand for all these scenarios where we may\n\n276\n00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:56.032\nsee these kinds of conspiracies\nas the starting point,\n\n277\n00:15:56.032 --> 00:16:00.961\ncuz you're gonna waste a lot of time and\neffort chasing things that aren't there.\n\n278\n00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:02.704\nBut there are times when they are, and\n\n279\n00:16:02.704 --> 00:16:05.606\nyou have to be open in the idea\nthat it's not always cut and dry.\n\n280\n00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:09.816\nNot always Hey, customer A was attacked,\ncustomer A was the target.\n\n281\n00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:13.190\nForget about all the collateral damage,\nit was just customer A.\n\n282\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.700\nWell that may or may not be true.\n\n283\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.833\nAnd as an investigator, it's our\nresponsibility to do some due diligence\n\n284\n00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:19.335\nand try to figure that out, right.\n\n285\n00:16:19.335 --> 00:16:22.913\nDid customer A and customer C have\nanything in common other then they\n\n286\n00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:25.487\nhappened to wind up on\nthe same infrastructure,\n\n287\n00:16:25.487 --> 00:16:28.245\nwith the same data\ncenter hosting provider?\n\n288\n00:16:28.245 --> 00:16:32.075\nMaybe, maybe not, we may be able to\nferret that out, we may not be able to.\n\n289\n00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.725\nBut those are the kind of things we gotta\nstart thinking about as well, right?\n\n290\n00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:36.275\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n291\n00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:38.215\nSo, we got a bunch of\nthese different attacks.\n\n292\n00:16:38.215 --> 00:16:41.230\nWhat we want to do is think about criminal\nactivity from three perspectives with\n\n293\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.092\nregards to the cloud.\n\n294\n00:16:42.092 --> 00:16:45.680\nAs investigators, we have to have\na frame of reference for this.\n\n295\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.160\nWe think of cloud as\nthe subject of the attack,\n\n296\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.580\ncloud as an object of the attack, and or\n\n297\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.570\ncloud as a tool of the attack, right,\nwhen we think about cloud environments.\n\n298\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.180\nSo, the cloud as a subject means\nthe crime in which the attackers\n\n299\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.069\nare trying to compromise the security\nof the cloud environment.\n\n300\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.400\nThey are, in other words,\nthe target is the cloud, right.\n\n301\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.070\nWe're trying to get in, break through\nthe cloud, get in and steal data or\n\n302\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.430\ninject some sort of malware,\nwho knows what.\n\n303\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.280\nBut the subject of the attack, essentially\nthe target, right, it's the same idea.\n\n304\n00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.340\nSo the cloud is a target,\nthe cloud is an object.\n\n305\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.680\nWe use the cloud to commit the actual\ncrime targeted towards the CSP.\n\n306\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.980\nWe are using the cloud as a way to\nget at the cloud service provider.\n\n307\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:34.110\nWe are attacking and impacting not just\none company, but broad service offerings.\n\n308\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.290\nRemember, if we wanna\ngo after company A but\n\n309\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.820\nnot be obvious, we may go after\nthe cloud provider, take down company A,\n\n310\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.430\nalso take down a lot of other\ncompanies we could care less about.\n\n311\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.620\nBut because there's 1,000\ncompanies that get affected,\n\n312\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.990\nwe're hiding the fact we wanted cloud\ncompany A or company A to be affected.\n\n313\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.220\nWe will go after the cloud\nservice provider.\n\n314\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.510\nTake on the AT&amp;T's, the Googles,\nthe Amazons of the world,\n\n315\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.970\nin order to get at a single company.\n\n316\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.290\nThat sounds crazy, but\nif you've got an orchestrated\n\n317\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.490\ngovernmental backed attack against\nan entity, they may do that\n\n318\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.160\nto hide the fact that they wanted that one\ncompany or that one asset to be affected.\n\n319\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.520\nUnusual, certainly highly suspect,\nbut could happen.\n\n320\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.440\nCloud as a tool, the attacker uses one\ncompromised cloud account to attack\n\n321\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.930\nanother one as I talked about.\n\n322\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.448\nWe jump into company A's infrastructure,\ntake control and\n\n323\n00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:26.750\nthen use that as a launching pad\nto get into other companies.\n\n324\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.090\nWe may or may not be successful.\n\n325\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.616\nSo, we have different ways of\nthinking about cloud and cloud crime.\n\n326\n00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:36.464\nAnd we have to be open to the idea as an\ninvestigator that there are quite a number\n\n327\n00:18:36.464 --> 00:18:41.312\nof these possible opportunities and things\nthat we would want to be aware of and\n\n328\n00:18:41.312 --> 00:18:45.520\nthink about, and as a result,\njust have in the back of our mind.\n\n329\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.810\nI thought it'd be interesting just to\nbreak out of our conversation around cloud\n\n330\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.350\nand the theory and all this stuff\nwe're talking about for a moment.\n\n331\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.266\nShow you a little bit of a hands-on\nthing not specific to cloud.\n\n332\n00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:58.241\nThis actually would be a demonstration\nthat would play equally well in our\n\n333\n00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:00.819\nnetwork and or\nour OS forensics in particular.\n\n334\n00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:04.829\nDiscussions that we've already had would\nplay really well in things like our\n\n335\n00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:08.345\nmalware forensics conversation that\nwould come up in a little bit,\n\n336\n00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:10.088\nor any of the other areas really.\n\n337\n00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:12.371\nBut I thought it would be\ninteresting to do it here,\n\n338\n00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:15.090\njust because it gives us\na perspective on a couple of things.\n\n339\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.027\nSo if you want to join me,\n\n340\n00:19:16.027 --> 00:19:18.769\nwant to show you how to dump the memory\nof a running instance of a machine.\n\n341\n00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:23.653\nWe talk a lot about volatile and dynamic\ndata acquisition, order of volatility,\n\n342\n00:19:23.653 --> 00:19:28.160\ngetting the contents around,\nknowing how to do that very important.\n\n343\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.330\nNo less important when we're\ndealing with the cloud.\n\n344\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.617\nNot because you're gonna\ndump the memory or\n\n345\n00:19:31.617 --> 00:19:33.017\nthe contents of the memory\non the cloud server.\n\n346\n00:19:33.017 --> 00:19:36.580\nYou're not gonna have access to that,\nwe've established that.\n\n347\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.730\nBut, could you dump\nthe contents of the running VM?\n\n348\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.770\nWell yeah, you could with tools like\nI'm gonna show you in the instance.\n\n349\n00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.689\nCould you dump the contents of the memory\non, in other words not just the running\n\n350\n00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:49.921\nVM, but perhaps on the machine\nthat is accessing the running VM?\n\n351\n00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:54.465\nLooking for evidence of confusion and\nor concern around malware and\n\n352\n00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:56.020\nthings like that.\n\n353\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.280\nCould you dump the RAM on a local\ninstance using a cloud [COUGH]\n\n354\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.030\nprogram such as Dropbox, such as OneDrive?\n\n355\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.135\nThink about these enterprise level,\nconsumer level, business grade,\n\n356\n00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:13.640\ncloud storage, cloud enterprise content\nmanagement platforms today that have\n\n357\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.442\nclient and server components.\n\n358\n00:20:15.442 --> 00:20:19.797\nAnd if we install the client piece on\nan end workstation, what are we gonna see\n\n359\n00:20:19.797 --> 00:20:24.320\nabout that, what files are there,\nwhat registry settings are modified.\n\n360\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.010\nDo we know the process is running?\n\n361\n00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.440\nIs it running the right way?\n\n362\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.100\nThere may be reasons to look at memory,\n\n363\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.820\nso knowing how to work with\nmemory I thought would be good.\n\n364\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.526\nAnd then just quickly reminding you of\nwhat kind of tools we would use to look at\n\n365\n00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:36.332\na memory image.\n\n366\n00:20:36.332 --> 00:20:40.646\nSomething like a hex editor, what we may\nfind using a string search, a technique\n\n367\n00:20:40.646 --> 00:20:45.390\nwe've already talked about and shown you\nor rather will talk about, I should say.\n\n368\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.710\nAnd show you how to use in the upcoming\nmalware forensics conversations.\n\n369\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.025\nTalked a little bit about it in\nthe OS forensics conversations.\n\n370\n00:20:53.025 --> 00:20:55.653\nWe haven't seen those on either\nside of these set of shows,\n\n371\n00:20:55.653 --> 00:20:57.085\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n372\n00:20:57.085 --> 00:20:58.935\nSo if you join me here,\nif we go full screen,\n\n373\n00:20:58.935 --> 00:21:02.335\nit's a little bit hard to see the detail\nthere, it's kind of a dark background.\n\n374\n00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:07.910\nAnd what we have is I have\na tool called the Belkasoft,\n\n375\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.360\nthis is the live RAM capture tool.\n\n376\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.050\nSo this runs as a tool that will\ncreate what's called a RAM image.\n\n377\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.182\nAnd so you could see here,\nselect a folder to output.\n\n378\n00:21:16.182 --> 00:21:18.646\nI've just launched\nthe executable on the machine,\n\n379\n00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:21.360\nthere's not a lot of mystery\nto this tool really.\n\n380\n00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.720\nWe just specify where\nwe wanna capture it to.\n\n381\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.920\nSo I've already done a capture\nthat's sitting in the folder\n\n382\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920\non the desktop here that I'm\ngonna examine in a minute,\n\n383\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.560\nbut let's just say I wanted\nto create another capture.\n\n384\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:39.006\nInstead of doing this to desktop cloud,\nif I just put the ram capture right here,\n\n385\n00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:45.784\nOn the desktop,\n\n386\n00:21:45.784 --> 00:21:51.550\nI would then be able to just create\na file sitting here locally, hit Capture.\n\n387\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.650\nYou'll see we have,\nlooks like 8 gigs of physical memory.\n\n388\n00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.760\nThis is a virtual machine,\nnot really physical memory, but\n\n389\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.030\nyou'll have virtual memory\nassigned from a host.\n\n390\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.442\nBut we're capturing the contents\nof what that memory is.\n\n391\n00:22:01.442 --> 00:22:05.353\nIt doesn't take very long, literally,\nprobably about 30 seconds or so to create.\n\n392\n00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:08.240\nBut you could see it's\ncreating it right now.\n\n393\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.523\nThis file right up here is gonna become\nthe capture file once we're done.\n\n394\n00:22:11.523 --> 00:22:16.690\nAnd once that's done, we'll have a .mem\nextension, it'll be a memory file.\n\n395\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.287\nThat is a capture of the dynamic\nmemory state of the machine.\n\n396\n00:22:19.287 --> 00:22:23.580\nWe talked about the crosswalk with this\nwhen we talked about snapshotting,\n\n397\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.350\nrunning virtual machines.\n\n398\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.030\nAnd being able to take the memory\nstate as part of that snapshot.\n\n399\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.940\nAnd then mounting that snapshot and\nexamining the registry and things like\n\n400\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.945\nthat that were going on, and were being\nused in that machine at that time.\n\n401\n00:22:35.945 --> 00:22:39.045\nSo it's just another way to\nget at that live memory state.\n\n402\n00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:43.089\nSo you see here I've got this\nparticular capture done,\n\n403\n00:22:43.089 --> 00:22:47.315\nsitting right here, .mem,\nit's got a number tag on it.\n\n404\n00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:50.515\nSo, .mem about just over 8 gigs,\nso that's it.\n\n405\n00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:51.215\nI've done that, so\n\n406\n00:22:51.215 --> 00:22:54.933\nnow that I do that, I would take\nthis file, right over here, right?\n\n407\n00:22:54.933 --> 00:23:01.040\nThat's the .mem capture file,\nand just to show you what this\n\n408\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.900\nlooks like, nothing like a little metadata\nto start the conversation off with, right?\n\n409\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.075\nSo it's got a .mem extension,\nit's about 8 gigs, right?\n\n410\n00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:13.065\nSize on drive, creation date and\ntime, you could see all that, right?\n\n411\n00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:17.259\nSo we just want to make sure we have that,\nthen we would open a tool like hex editor,\n\n412\n00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:20.975\npick your hex editor, WinHex,\nHexD, I've got a bunch.\n\n413\n00:23:20.975 --> 00:23:22.647\nI have one that I've loaded up here.\n\n414\n00:23:22.647 --> 00:23:28.687\nSo if we go in here, and we go and we take\na look as we always do, just to tell you.\n\n415\n00:23:28.687 --> 00:23:32.527\nYou can see here, right, the hex editor\nHexD, just so you know the programs we're\n\n416\n00:23:32.527 --> 00:23:35.647\nusing and if you want to go out and\ngrab a copy of them and use them.\n\n417\n00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:38.406\nTry to use programs when we're\ndoing the demonstrations,\n\n418\n00:23:38.406 --> 00:23:41.935\nthe hands-on element that are either free\nor at least you can get a demo of and\n\n419\n00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:44.085\nuse for\na period of time without having to buy,\n\n420\n00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:47.598\nnot because we don't want you to support\nthe people that make these tools.\n\n421\n00:23:47.598 --> 00:23:50.543\nVery important to do that when\nyou're working professionally, but\n\n422\n00:23:50.543 --> 00:23:53.840\nbecause we want you to have access to\nthe tools to play with, to examine them,\n\n423\n00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.841\nto get your feet wet,\nto practice, to study.\n\n424\n00:23:55.841 --> 00:23:59.132\nCertainly to get ready for an exam, so\nthat you can do that without having to\n\n425\n00:23:59.132 --> 00:24:02.124\ninvest a lot of additional Resources,\nright, in order to do that.\n\n426\n00:24:02.124 --> 00:24:05.062\nSo you have the hex editor tool,\none of many, we looked at WinHex,\n\n427\n00:24:05.062 --> 00:24:07.274\nsome of the earlier episodes,\nthings like that.\n\n428\n00:24:07.274 --> 00:24:10.594\nWe just go open,\nfind the memory file, right?\n\n429\n00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:13.327\nWe load it up,\nthis is the actual memory capture.\n\n430\n00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:14.641\nAnd what I've done is,\n\n431\n00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:18.074\nyou could see there's a whole\nbunch of stuff in here, right?\n\n432\n00:24:18.074 --> 00:24:22.173\nThat's in Hex and a whole bunch of stuff\nthat is string data that we can look at.\n\n433\n00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:26.817\nAnd the best way to do this\nwould be to do a Ctrl+F and\n\n434\n00:24:26.817 --> 00:24:32.551\nsimply do a find for the strings\nthat you want to be able to grab.\n\n435\n00:24:32.551 --> 00:24:35.880\nI searched for the term Windows just\nbecause I knew there would be a lot of\n\n436\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.891\nreferences to Windows and their services,\nsoftware, things like that, running.\n\n437\n00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:45.359\nAnd so you could see that there's an\ninstance of the word Windows right there.\n\n438\n00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:49.000\nThere's the hex code or the equivalent\nof the hex of the string in hex.\n\n439\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.940\nAnd so I'm starting to be able\nto find specific elements,\n\n440\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.362\nitems in the memory map and\nI could start marking them for analysis.\n\n441\n00:24:55.362 --> 00:25:00.046\nI can look at the offset, this particular\nstring that we're looking for.\n\n442\n00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:02.351\nLooks like it's at this offset right here.\n\n443\n00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:08.237\n000113090, and 0001130A0.\n\n444\n00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:09.642\nSo it's between those two.\n\n445\n00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:14.000\nSo I can start referring and marking\nthose offsets so I can track the data,\n\n446\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.774\nfigure out where stuff is.\n\n447\n00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:19.364\nLook, there's another instance\nof the word hack, and so\n\n448\n00:25:19.364 --> 00:25:21.721\nI wanna write that down and find that.\n\n449\n00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:23.917\nRemember in the thought process here and\n\n450\n00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:27.477\nyou'll see this in the upcoming\nconversations around malware.\n\n451\n00:25:27.477 --> 00:25:29.453\nMalware forensics where we go in,\n\n452\n00:25:29.453 --> 00:25:33.144\nwe take apart some suspicious\nquote unquote packages, right?\n\n453\n00:25:33.144 --> 00:25:36.308\nA couple of different executables that\nwill show you how to analyze them\n\n454\n00:25:36.308 --> 00:25:36.948\nstatically.\n\n455\n00:25:36.948 --> 00:25:41.710\nWe'll show you how to pull them apart, use\na hex editor, see what's going on in them,\n\n456\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.887\nuse a dependency walker tool to look at\nthe DLLs and see evidence of functions\n\n457\n00:25:45.887 --> 00:25:49.565\nthat may indicate malwares wrapped\nup somewhere in that package.\n\n458\n00:25:49.565 --> 00:25:54.336\nWe'll use a string search tool from system\ninternals called strings to be able to do\n\n459\n00:25:54.336 --> 00:25:57.677\na string verification or\ncentered string walk looking for\n\n460\n00:25:57.677 --> 00:25:59.874\nthese suspicious elements, right?\n\n461\n00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:03.791\nI'm gonna demonstrate how to do those\nthings from a static analysis perspective\n\n462\n00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:04.431\non malware.\n\n463\n00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:07.662\nThere's nothing different in memory,\nwe approach it the same way,\n\n464\n00:26:07.662 --> 00:26:09.849\nwe're looking for suspicious information.\n\n465\n00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:13.468\nSo just because it's in the cloud doesn't\nmean it's gonna be handled differently.\n\n466\n00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:17.823\nIt just means that we have to be thinking\nabout the fact that there may be evidence\n\n467\n00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:21.205\nof cloud related information\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n468\n00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:23.611\nAnd the dynamic memory of\na machine accessing the cloud,\n\n469\n00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:25.127\nwe don't wanna forget about that.\n\n470\n00:26:25.127 --> 00:26:27.621\nBecause our focus tends\nto be it's in the cloud,\n\n471\n00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:29.538\nwe gotta go to the data center, right?\n\n472\n00:26:29.538 --> 00:26:32.824\nLet's go figure out where Google's\ngot our data and let's go there and\n\n473\n00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:36.737\nget all the forensic information we need\non the server side, on the hosting Inside.\n\n474\n00:26:36.737 --> 00:26:38.989\nWell yeah,\nthere's definitely a need for that, but\n\n475\n00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:41.702\nthere's also a need to think about\nwhat was the on ramp, right?\n\n476\n00:26:41.702 --> 00:26:44.642\nWhat was the portal we opened up,\nwhere did it come from and\n\n477\n00:26:44.642 --> 00:26:46.033\nhow did we get to the cloud?\n\n478\n00:26:46.033 --> 00:26:49.151\nBecause there's gonna be valuable data,\nvaluable evidence there as well.\n\n479\n00:26:49.151 --> 00:26:53.216\nSo we gotta be looking at both sides of\nthis divide in order to ensure that we\n\n480\n00:26:53.216 --> 00:26:57.035\nunderstand the proper way to approach\nthe cloud forensics problem.\n\n481\n00:26:57.035 --> 00:27:00.931\nAnd that we're gathering evidence in both\nlocations in order to ensure we can tell\n\n482\n00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:03.472\nan accurate and complete story,\nhave an accurate and\n\n483\n00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:06.303\ncomplete picture in a sense\nof what's actually happened.\n\n484\n00:27:06.303 --> 00:27:07.727\nOtherwise we only have half the story.\n\n485\n00:27:07.727 --> 00:27:09.083\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't want half the story, right?\n\n486\n00:27:09.083 --> 00:27:12.868\nWe want the whole story, the whole kebab,\nas they say, the big enchilada, so-\n\n487\n00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:13.705\n&gt;&gt; Depends only on how hungry you are.\n\n488\n00:27:13.705 --> 00:27:15.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you can tell-\n&gt;&gt; May only want have an enchilada.\n\n489\n00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:16.778\nYou can tell where my mind is today.\n\n490\n00:27:16.778 --> 00:27:18.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n491\n00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:21.707\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\nwe're going to continue this conversation.\n\n492\n00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:23.503\nWe have plenty more to come.\n\n493\n00:27:23.503 --> 00:27:26.359\nReally cool stuff though\nwith the memory dump.\n\n494\n00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:29.080\nThat is an interesting thing to\nbe able to know how to do and\n\n495\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.106\nwork with that information to\nfind things that are happening.\n\n496\n00:27:32.106 --> 00:27:35.783\nRunning inside of your actual\nmachine at that given point in time,\n\n497\n00:27:35.783 --> 00:27:38.354\nmaybe looking for\nsome malfeasance going on.\n\n498\n00:27:38.354 --> 00:27:42.285\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, big word, big word.\n\n499\n00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:43.760\n&gt;&gt; My word of the day\ncalendar's really paying off.\n\n500\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Now the question is,\ncan you spell malfeasance?\n\n501\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.021\nCuz it's one thing to say it.\n\n502\n00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:48.875\n&gt;&gt; There's a silent J in there [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:51.962\n&gt;&gt; Along with a Z at the end,\nyou don't hear that either.\n\n504\n00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:53.983\nI could not spell that,\nI couldn't spell that to save my life.\n\n505\n00:27:53.983 --> 00:27:56.497\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right everyone,\nthanks for watching this episode.\n\n506\n00:27:56.497 --> 00:28:00.193\nDefinitely join us for part three,\nbut signing off for ITProTV.\n\n507\n00:28:00.193 --> 00:28:01.633\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n508\n00:28:01.633 --> 00:28:02.586\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n509\n00:28:02.586 --> 00:28:04.214\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n510\n00:28:04.214 -->

00:00:11.626\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.454\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:16.090\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.960\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.593\nToday's episode is more on CHFI,\nVersion 9, the most awesome version yet.\n\n8\n00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:25.925\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.365\nAdam, glad to have you man,\nhow is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:31.250\n&gt;&gt; Good you know why nine\nis more awesome than eight?\n\n11\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.780\n&gt;&gt; No, why?\n\n12\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.955\n&gt;&gt; Because there's not a bottom\nloop contain all the awesomeness\n\n13\n00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:36.305\n&gt;&gt; It's bursting out.\n\n14\n00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:38.545\n&gt;&gt; It can filter out to everybody so\nyou can get-\n\n15\n00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:39.295\n&gt;&gt; Pregnant with awesome!\n\n16\n00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:40.265\n&gt;&gt; More awesomeness,\n\n17\n00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.545\nis how that works with nine,\nwe've released, like release the craken?\n\n18\n00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:44.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Released the awesomeness.\n\n19\n00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:46.098\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; That is why is is more\n\n20\n00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:47.280\nawesome that eight.\n\n21\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.205\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n22\n00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:50.280\nhence the reason we're here\nto talk about it with you.\n\n23\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.290\n&gt;&gt; At least 75% more awesome.\n\n24\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes, but\n\n25\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.980\nonly if you don't wash it,\nyou have to wash it in cold water.\n\n26\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.510\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n27\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.220\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't shrink.\n\n28\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.705\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise you lose the awesomeness.\n\n29\n00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n30\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.750\nwe're gonna continue talking\nabout cloud and cloud forensics.\n\n31\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.732\nwe're gonna jump into our hit list\nof cloud forensics challenges.\n\n32\n00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.380\nWe talked about some attacks\nIn our prior episode.\n\n33\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.410\nThe issues and concerns around making sure\nwe understand multi-hosting environments\n\n34\n00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.460\ngave you a little piece of information\nthat's valuable there, for you,\n\n35\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.850\nwith regards to the thought process Of the\nfact that majority when facing the Cloud\n\n36\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.600\nis gonna be the same as what we\nface in non-Cloud environments.\n\n37\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.110\nBut we do have to think\nabout multi-tendency\n\n38\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.580\nas being one of the key indicators of\ndifferentiation, and therefore focus and\n\n39\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.880\nconcern for us as investigators.\n\n40\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.520\nAnd we also gave you a little hands-on\ndemo of how to capture live memory from\n\n41\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.370\na machine and how to interpret that\nusing a Hex setter, kind of cool stuff.\n\n42\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.580\nSo, lets talk about some\ncloud forensic challenges.\n\n43\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.190\nWe have a long laundry list of things\nthat we have to be aware of it and\n\n44\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.330\nconcerned about.\n\n45\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.380\nProbably near the top of that list is the\nsame kind of concern we have in non-cloud\n\n46\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.108\nenvironment, where our data is,\n\n47\n00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.985\nis certainly a primary\nconcerned in every environment.\n\n48\n00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:01.497\nBut especially with regards to,\nCloud based environments,\n\n49\n00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:05.227\nwe don't know whether our\ndata is in one location,\n\n50\n00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:09.480\nmultiple locations,\nis it just local on a work station?\n\n51\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.170\nWouldn't be in traditional\ncloud environments if it was.\n\n52\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.922\nSo we have to understand that while there\nmay be a cash copy We do have one or\n\n53\n00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:18.459\nmore repositories somewhere\nelse in the cloud.\n\n54\n00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.239\nAnd as a result, we have to deal with and\nperhaps address concerns\n\n55\n00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.777\nin multiple geographies, multiple\njurisdictions, multiple time zones and\n\n56\n00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:31.726\nwith multiple policies, processes, and\nprocedures overlaid on top of them through\n\n57\n00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:35.538\none or more cloud vendors that may or\nmay not reflect accurately.\n\n58\n00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:39.924\nAnd therefore be easily aligned with\nthe policies we use to manage the local\n\n59\n00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:41.820\ncontent in our own systems.\n\n60\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.070\nSo there's this differentiation around\nwhere data is that we have to consider.\n\n61\n00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.790\nAnd to that end, the deletion of data\nis a huge cloud forensics challenge.\n\n62\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.850\nBecause of the multi-jurisdictional,\nmulti-geographical\n\n63\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.060\nmatrix we have to consider with regards\nto cloud hosting in many cases.\n\n64\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.405\nWe may not be able to ascertain and\nvalidate with reasonable assureness,\n\n65\n00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:06.345\nor reasonable surety, that data has or\n\n66\n00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:11.305\nhas not been securely destroyed or\nindeed it is or is not remnant,\n\n67\n00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:14.947\nanother way of thinking about it on one or\nmore instances or systems.\n\n68\n00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:17.537\nYeah, you see these blinking\nlights behind me every so often.\n\n69\n00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:20.947\nI point to them in some shows, and\nrefer to the fact that this could be\n\n70\n00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:23.817\ndata center infrastructure\nalmost anywhere today,\n\n71\n00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:27.487\nand that we would see storage\nbeing used in a variety of ways.\n\n72\n00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.898\nIf this was a physical data center\nlocation for a cloud hosting model, and\n\n73\n00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:35.738\nwe had to then,\nas a forensic investigator, show up and\n\n74\n00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:39.538\ntry to do an investigation, we can't just\nliterally walk up to the front door,\n\n75\n00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:41.750\nknock on it, and\nexpect to be given access.\n\n76\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.090\nDoesn't work that way, we would\nhave to go through proper channels,\n\n77\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.750\nnegotiate with the provider.\n\n78\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.420\nProbably go through\nthe legal challenges and\n\n79\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.230\nconcerns associated with accessing\ndata under that jurisdiction.\n\n80\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.330\nMost likely get whatever passes for\na court order or a ruling from a judge\n\n81\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.920\nin that municipality, in that locality,\nwhatever that requires, wherever we are.\n\n82\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.450\nAnd even then, when we show up,\nthere may still be a process and\n\n83\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.920\na thought process around how we're gonna\nbe able to execute that search warrant,\n\n84\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.230\nis different by county and\ndifferent by incident.\n\n85\n00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.550\nWe have to partner with\nlocal law enforcement.\n\n86\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.680\nThey may or may not have a working\nrelationship with the provider,\n\n87\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.270\nthe provider may or\nmay not choose to comply right away.\n\n88\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.178\nThey may want to examine that order,\nhave their legal team involve.\n\n89\n00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:31.150\nSometime these become retracted of\nthings that have to be dealt with.\n\n90\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.120\nI'm not suggesting the cloud provider\nultimately would not comply.\n\n91\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.885\nThere's a legal requirement on the table.\n\n92\n00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:39.810\nThey do have to comply, but\nit may take time for them to comply.\n\n93\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.890\nWe may not be able to show up and\nexpect to be granted access immediately,\n\n94\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.900\nand there may be very tightly\nconstrained conditions\n\n95\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.790\naround the kind of access we are granted.\n\n96\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.030\nWe may have to walk through\nthe data center, most likely,\n\n97\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.050\nnot may have to, most likely will\nhave to being escorted by one or\n\n98\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.440\nmore security individuals or\noversight individuals.\n\n99\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.710\nWe may not be given direct\naccess to the material we seek.\n\n100\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.140\nThere may be a designated, duly appointed\nrepresentative of the cloud provider\n\n101\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.210\nthat will go execute the warrant\nwith local law enforcement.\n\n102\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.116\nAnd after we do the gathering of the data,\nthe removal of the hard drives,\n\n103\n00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:16.203\nwhatever may be, and we may or\nmay not be allowed to watch.\n\n104\n00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:19.101\nWe may or may not be able to\ndrive that process, we may or\n\n105\n00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:23.322\nmay not be able to oversee it, and we may\njust be sitting, waiting in a room until\n\n106\n00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:27.640\nthey bring us what passes for the data and\ncomplies with the search warrant.\n\n107\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.980\nSo there's a lot of ways this may\nplay out, we have to understand that.\n\n108\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.800\nSo deletion of data, revocation of\nthat ,is a significant challenge for\n\n109\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.730\nus in the cloud.\n\n110\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.670\nRecovery of overwritten data kind\nof falls into the same category.\n\n111\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.830\nWhere is the data?\n\n112\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.780\nDo we have access to the physical medium?\n\n113\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.861\nCan we get to the NAS network\nattach storage, to SAN,\n\n114\n00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:46.890\nstorage area network system.\n\n115\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.040\nIf so, how does that work?\n\n116\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.460\nAre we gonna be able to work\nforensically on that drive?\n\n117\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.650\nThere's a lot of questions and\nconcerns, right.\n\n118\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.425\nInteroperability of Cloud service\nproviders, if we're hosting And\n\n119\n00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.375\ndealing with multiple cloud scenarios.\n\n120\n00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:03.425\nDo cloud providers have\ninteroperability on their platforms?\n\n121\n00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.825\nWill they talk with other cloud providers?\n\n122\n00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:09.295\nDo they provide backwards\ncompatibility with our tool sets?\n\n123\n00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:10.775\nThere's a lot of concerns here.\n\n124\n00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.795\nA lot o these providers\nare running proprietary networks.\n\n125\n00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:16.915\nThey build their own hardware,\nthey have their own operating systems,\n\n126\n00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:19.220\nand they have their own\ntool sets to manage them.\n\n127\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.170\nWhile data formats are somewhat\nstandardized, that doesn't necessarily\n\n128\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.210\nmean that our tools will execute\nproperly in those environments.\n\n129\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.440\nAnd we may have to rely on the provider\nand their tool sets to gather the data,\n\n130\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.500\nwhether it's forensically sound or\nnot, it is up for conversation and\n\n131\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.530\ndebate in some cases.\n\n132\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.130\nSo, that can be an issue.\n\n133\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.730\nWhat about single point of failure?\n\n134\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.860\nYou have the cloud represents\na broadly scalable and\n\n135\n00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.775\nbroadly geographically dispersed\ngrid like environment.\n\n136\n00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.445\nBut that doesn't mean that there\naren't singly points of failure.\n\n137\n00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:56.043\nIt just means there are fewer and\nfarther between right?\n\n138\n00:06:56.043 --> 00:07:01.335\nBut, a single point of failure in terms\nof an on ramp to the cloud, a band width\n\n139\n00:07:01.335 --> 00:07:05.635\naccess point, perhaps a work station\nthat's primarily used to do that or that\n\n140\n00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:10.870\nis downloaded, the software the API access\nor whatever it may be to access that.\n\n141\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.500\nPerhaps key management and key storage, if\nwe only have a single copy of that key or\n\n142\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.070\naccess to it through one\ndedicated workstation,\n\n143\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.930\ncan all present potential\nsingle points of failure.\n\n144\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.390\nNothing like waking up on a Monday morning\nand finding out your encryption key is\n\n145\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.200\ngone, and you don't have a backup,\nor a key escrow and\n\n146\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.320\na key recovery mechanism, to ensure\nthat you can get back to the data.\n\n147\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.820\nAt that point, it's probably good\nto think about going on vacation.\n\n148\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGHS]\n\n149\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Let somebody else deal\n\n150\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.330\nwith that, right?\n\n151\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.950\nNo, I'm not on call for\nthe the next month, that's somebody else.\n\n152\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.261\nRight, detection of malicious activity,\nthis can be initial in the cloud for\n\n153\n00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.182\na lot of reasons we've\nall ready discussed.\n\n154\n00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:44.581\nIt may not be our systems,\n\n155\n00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:48.333\nit maybe another tenant,\nanother customer totally unrelated to us,\n\n156\n00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.481\nthat house the malicious activity\nhappening that is the origination point.\n\n157\n00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.742\nHow do we diagnose that\nas an investigator?\n\n158\n00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.551\nHow do we do we track that back?\n\n159\n00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:00.295\nWe need the help of the cloud provider, if\nthey're not willing to play ball with us,\n\n160\n00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:03.725\nit becomes very difficult, if not\nimpossible to deal with these things, and\n\n161\n00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:05.840\nthis is a significant challenge for us.\n\n162\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.845\nReal time investigations are not\noften possible, as I pointed out.\n\n163\n00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:13.429\nThe cloud provider is first and\nforemost interested in supporting and\n\n164\n00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:16.890\nmaintaining their operating\nenvironment to earn their money.\n\n165\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.540\nThey're not interested\nin delaying that for\n\n166\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.590\nany reason,\nunless absolutely compelled to by law.\n\n167\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.750\nWhich means they have no\ncompelling interest to be nice and\n\n168\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.650\nbend over backwards to help us out, unless\nsomebody's threatening them to do so.\n\n169\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.240\nLet me be clear.\n\n170\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.360\nI'm not trying to cast a bad or in any\nway negative light on cloud providers.\n\n171\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.080\nI'm not suggesting that\nthey don't follow the law.\n\n172\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.250\nI'm not suggesting that they\ndon't want to do the right thing.\n\n173\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.450\nI'm just being realistic with you about\nthe fact that they're running their\n\n174\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.380\nbusiness and if you're trying\nto get in the way of that,\n\n175\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.520\nthere has to be a compelling reason for\nthem to allow you to do that.\n\n176\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.140\nOr it just doesn't make sense for them.\n\n177\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.310\nThat's the reality.\n\n178\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.030\nYou're a nuisance, in other words, and\na delay for them and unless they are being\n\n179\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.110\ntold by a court of law that they have\nto comply, in which case they do.\n\n180\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.160\nLet's be fair and be honest,\nthey certainly will do that.\n\n181\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.533\nThen there's really probably,\nnot an overwhelming compelling reason for\n\n182\n00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:11.350\nthem to move heaven and earth to allow\nyou to do your real time investigations.\n\n183\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.010\nSo you do have to understand when you\nshow up in one of these scenarios within\n\n184\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.280\ncertain response and forensics in\nmind around cloud providers and\n\n185\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.340\ncloud activities that there\nmay not be the same agenda\n\n186\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.740\non the cloud provider's table\ntoday as there is on your table.\n\n187\n00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.540\nAnd those two things may clash.\n\n188\n00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.050\nAnd because they hold the keys to\nthe kingdom, they're gonna win, right?\n\n189\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.100\nUnless you brought law enforcement with\nyou and a piece of paper that says,\n\n190\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.300\nsorry you've gotta stop what you're doing.\n\n191\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo, just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n192\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:44.480\nYou're not gonna rely on the niceties and\nthe beneficiary of being nice is a good\n\n193\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.520\nthing, but the reality is they might just\nnot be interested in talking to you.\n\n194\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.170\nYou might not get past\nthe lobby unless you've got\n\n195\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.760\na search warrant because they just\naren't gonna pay attention to you.\n\n196\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.510\n&gt;&gt; Adam, really quickly.\n\n197\n00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.880\nIt was making me think that,\nif I'm sharing hardware resources,\n\n198\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.970\nsuch as storage, and\nmaybe even a same drive.\n\n199\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.240\nWe're sharing a drive between\ntwo different companies.\n\n200\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.230\nWhen I go back to my first\nresponder kind of idea of\n\n201\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.900\nwe're not supposed to modify\nthe drive in any way.\n\n202\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.630\nWe're not supposed to\nmake writes to the drive.\n\n203\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.650\nIf I'm not making writes but\nanother company is making writes\n\n204\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.720\nto the exact same drive, does that\ncorrupt the integrity of the data?\n\n205\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Well remember, it's not that you\nwould necessarily share the same drive.\n\n206\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.420\nI mean, yes, theoretically.\n\n207\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.080\nCertainly in terms of a large drive\nenclosure, there may be in a raid\n\n208\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.970\nscenario, or in some sort of large\nscenario where we're using a SAN,\n\n209\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.170\nstorage area network, and maybe\nstriping data, doing different things.\n\n210\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.420\nThere may very well be hard\ndrives in common, right?\n\n211\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.170\nBut the reality is,\nwe're creating partitionable space, right,\n\n212\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.930\nfor each of these individual customers,\nif you wanna just think about it that way.\n\n213\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.940\nAnd so my company's data is\ngoing onto the same common\n\n214\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.540\nstorage area network as Daniel let's say\nyour company's data but we're not gonna be\n\n215\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.550\nin the same logical space writing,\nreading to and from let's say.\n\n216\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.910\nThat data or those data sets, right,\n\n217\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.070\nbecause obviously we're not sharing\ncommon data, but those data sets\n\n218\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.520\nare stored differently from a logical\nspace management perspective.\n\n219\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.630\nEven though physically they may\nreside in the same systems, and\n\n220\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.500\nas a result we're not as\nconcerned about okay,\n\n221\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.860\nhey Daniel goes to access\nthe file called resume update.\n\n222\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.140\nAnd I go to access the file called\nspreadsheets for IP addresses.\n\n223\n00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.680\nAnd we're writing to the same\nsectors of the same drive, right.\n\n224\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.425\nYeah, we're writing to different\ndrive areas called partitions.\n\n225\n00:11:38.425 --> 00:11:41.585\nAnd those partitions are logically\nisolated from each other.\n\n226\n00:11:41.585 --> 00:11:43.494\nAnd as, maybe physically isolated as well,\n\n227\n00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.565\ndepends on obviously on\na lot of circumstances.\n\n228\n00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:48.115\nBut assuming we're not paying extras,\nwe said, for\n\n229\n00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:51.629\nlet's say hypothetically dedicated\nsystems, dedicated storage, but\n\n230\n00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:54.475\nrather on these common networks,\nwe're still isolated.\n\n231\n00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:56.920\nSo, we're not worried about that.\n\n232\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.390\nBut what we are worried about, and kind\nof a direct result of what you suggested\n\n233\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.680\nis the flip side of that which is hey,\nI show up as the forensic investigator or\n\n234\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.920\njust as a law enforcement official\ninvolved in serving a search warrant,\n\n235\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.790\nfacilitating a forensic investigation\nrequest from the court.\n\n236\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:19.010\nAnd we encumber,\nwe take the storage as part of\n\n237\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.580\nour gathering of evidence for company\nx because they're under indictment.\n\n238\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.590\nWell, the problem may be to your point\nthat there may be other companies\n\n239\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.330\nhosted on that same infrastructure.\n\n240\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.270\nWe may inconvenience and indeed actually\nshut off, for lack of a better way\n\n241\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:38.120\nof talking about it, or at least in\nthe minimum inconvenience access.\n\n242\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.290\nAnd inconvenience the ability to do\nthe company's job because we may\n\n243\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.600\nshut down and/or remove access to\nresources that are held in common.\n\n244\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.010\nAnd that can be a problem.\n\n245\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.420\nYou get caught up in this broad\nnet with regards to cloud hosting.\n\n246\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.330\nBecause if somebody's bad activities\nhappen in the same systems that you host,\n\n247\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.480\nand even though you're not doing\nanything wrong, let's be clear.\n\n248\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.030\nDaniel.\n\n249\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Did nothing wrong, right?\n\n250\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.380\nIt was all me,\nbecause the guy with the beard,\n\n251\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.730\nthat's the guy you've gotta watch, right?\n\n252\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.545\nSo it was all me.\n\n253\n00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:06.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n254\n00:13:06.045 --> 00:13:06.645\nWell, I can't say...\n\n255\n00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:07.375\nI was gonna say,\n\n256\n00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:08.625\nyou have a beard too.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n257\n00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:10.265\n&gt;&gt; But the guy with the zebra-like\n\n258\n00:13:10.265 --> 00:13:13.720\nbead is the guy you've gotta watch.\nSo when I'm up to no good, but\n\n259\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.160\nDaniel gets lumped in with me, Daniel\nhas nothing to worry about long term.\n\n260\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.508\nBut short term, Daniel's data may actually\nbe removed as part of the investigation.\n\n261\n00:13:23.508 --> 00:13:25.910\nAnd he may not be able to\nget access to it for awhile.\n\n262\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.473\nHis systems may get turned off\nas part of this investigation.\n\n263\n00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:32.103\nWhile we're doing the work on\nthe backend to gather data and\n\n264\n00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.080\nhe may have nothing to say about it,\nright?\n\n265\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.635\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, yeah,\n\n266\n00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:39.595\nthe service provider, through their SLA is\ngonna potentially owe you some money but\n\n267\n00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:42.045\nthere is an act of God\nclause in most of those.\n\n268\n00:13:42.045 --> 00:13:45.955\nAnd while investigations are not\nconsidered acts of God, just to be clear,\n\n269\n00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:49.625\nthere may also be language in your\nhosting agreements that says in certain\n\n270\n00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:54.750\ncircumstances, when you are hosting in\ncommon, in multi-tenant environments,\n\n271\n00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.950\nif there is a legal requirement for\nus to comply with a e-discovery.\n\n272\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.800\nAnd there's different language\ndepending on the provider.\n\n273\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.130\nBut essentially what they're saying is\neither e-discovery, search order, etc.\n\n274\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.210\nA legal requirements compliance\nis typically what you see.\n\n275\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.840\nAs a result, we may disrupt service\nin order to do so and we are not\n\n276\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.410\ngoing to be held liable to the terms of\nthe SLA during those disruptive events.\n\n277\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.840\nMeaning if they've got to shut\nyou off to let a team go in and\n\n278\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.100\ntear apart the SAN looking for data and\nyou're down for a day, guess what?\n\n279\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.250\nThey will do their best to move you to\nanother system and bring you back up.\n\n280\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.710\nI'm not saying you're just off and\nthat's it.\n\n281\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.330\nBut during the disruption,\nthey don't owe you anything under an SLA\n\n282\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.630\ncuz that exclusionary language says\nessentially, hey this is what is it.\n\n283\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.370\nThe law came and said we gotta do this,\nwe're doing it, we don't have a choice,\n\n284\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.940\nwe have to comply.\n\n285\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.030\nAnd you're just gonna\nhave to deal with it, so\n\n286\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.015\nit depends on your hosting agreements.\n\n287\n00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:47.220\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those things that\n\n288\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.320\na lot of people don't realize, and they\ndon't see in the Cloud because in the rush\n\n289\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.370\nto just use the technology,\na lot of us may not read the fine print.\n\n290\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.860\nYou've gotta read what's in\nthose hosting agreements.\n\n291\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.780\nYou can negotiate a right to a audit.\n\n292\n00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.810\nYou can negotiate some of these things,\nright?\n\n293\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.780\nAnd you can have coverage for that.\n\n294\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.930\nBut you've gotta spend the time up\nfront to figure these things out or\n\n295\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.340\nyou're bound by the general boilerplate\nagreement language, and that may or\n\n296\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.440\nmay not be in your favor.\n\n297\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.170\nIt really just depends on\nultimately who you're hosting with.\n\n298\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:16.770\nHow big you are,\n\n299\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.240\nhow much money you're spending and\nwhat rights you have negotiated.\n\n300\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.540\nGeo preference for hosting of data to keep\ndata in the borders of a specific country\n\n301\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.990\nregardless of event.\n\n302\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.050\nIn order to facilitate adherence\nwith statutory requirements for\n\n303\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.790\ncertain regulated environments.\n\n304\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.370\nFinancial services, healthcare, medical.\n\n305\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.763\nIn the US, and in the European Union, etc.\n\n306\n00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:43.347\nThat data cannot necessarily be\ntrans-border in its nature because\n\n307\n00:15:43.347 --> 00:15:45.876\nit may violate privacy regulations,\n\n308\n00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:51.249\nand/or expose confidential data in a way\nthat's not acceptable to customers,\n\n309\n00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:55.532\nnot acceptable to the business,\nnot acceptable under the law.\n\n310\n00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:58.962\nIf we don't look for that, and\ntoday things have changed dramatically.\n\n311\n00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:03.080\nIn the early wild west kind of frontier\ndays of Cloud there was no clear\n\n312\n00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.050\nunderstanding of let's keep the data here\nversus let's have it be transborder and\n\n313\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.628\nmove it.\n\n314\n00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:12.116\nAnd the providers just kinda did what\nthey needed to do to run their networks.\n\n315\n00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:14.881\nAnd if the data center on the east\ncoast of the US failed and\n\n316\n00:16:14.881 --> 00:16:17.935\nthe fail over target was the data\ncenter in Ireland for Europe,\n\n317\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.870\nguess what you're data was making a trip,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.210\nAnd if you didn't know about it,\nyou didn't know about it.\n\n319\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.880\nThat does certainly can still\nhappen today but more and\n\n320\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.940\nmore, most of these hosting agreements\nspecially on the business side\n\n321\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.375\nare designed specifically with\na geopreference hosting clause.\n\n322\n00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:37.251\nYour data will be guaranteed not to be\nmoved out of the secure boundaries or\n\n323\n00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:38.510\nsecurity boundaries.\n\n324\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.540\nOr national jurisdictional boundaries\nof the government that is making that\n\n325\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.110\ncommitment or let's say,\nthe country you're hosting it.\n\n326\n00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.145\nAnd because of that your data will stay\nresident in country x even if it has to\n\n327\n00:16:50.145 --> 00:16:54.192\nfail over into a data center somewhere\nelse in that country it will do that.\n\n328\n00:16:54.192 --> 00:16:58.486\nOr perhaps doesn't have a fail over\noption because there is no option in that\n\n329\n00:16:58.486 --> 00:16:59.280\ncountry.\n\n330\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.320\nYou have to be aware of that sign off\non the fact that will be the case.\n\n331\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.350\nBut government hosting in the cloud for\nthings like gov cloud in the US and\n\n332\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.820\nacross the world, this is the requirement.\n\n333\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.570\nIf you can't guarantee\nthat data does not move,\n\n334\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.300\nthe government will not host\nwith you as a provider.\n\n335\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.007\nSo these high end providers all\nhave these commitments in writing.\n\n336\n00:17:18.007 --> 00:17:21.380\nAnd they will fail the data over inside\ntheir networks within the geographic\n\n337\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.547\nboundary of the country.\n\n338\n00:17:22.547 --> 00:17:25.105\nBut they won't move it beyond\nthere because they do not,\n\n339\n00:17:25.105 --> 00:17:28.960\nthe government does not want that data\nleaving they're legal jurisdictional area.\n\n340\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.580\nThey wanna have a tight\nstranglehold on that data.\n\n341\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.416\nSo there's a lot of different\nways to interpret this.\n\n342\n00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:34.054\nWe have to think about it.\n\n343\n00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.114\nIt's a good question,\na good thought process.\n\n344\n00:17:36.114 --> 00:17:37.374\nHey, is it logical?\n\n345\n00:17:37.374 --> 00:17:37.875\nIs it physical?\n\n346\n00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:38.781\nWhat does that mean?\n\n347\n00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:39.763\nHow do we deal with it?\n\n348\n00:17:39.763 --> 00:17:41.780\nThese are the concerns\nthat we have in the Cloud.\n\n349\n00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.610\nMalicious code may break the MI selation,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n350\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.569\nVM escape, VM hopping,\ndifferent attacks and concerns there.\n\n351\n00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:50.642\nOne company doesn't do\ntheir due diligence,\n\n352\n00:17:50.642 --> 00:17:53.260\ndoesn't keep up with patch management.\n\n353\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.072\nWe have an issue there that could cascade\nover through a series of bad choices,\n\n354\n00:17:57.072 --> 00:17:57.661\nmistakes.\n\n355\n00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:02.248\nAnd failures into other companies that had\nno idea that they were even gonna have\n\n356\n00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.347\nan issue, right.\n\n357\n00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:04.216\nThey're not the target,\n\n358\n00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:06.830\nthey're just collateral damage\nlike I've been suggesting, right.\n\n359\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.879\nThat can be an issue, just going along,\nminding your own business.\n\n360\n00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:09.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:18:09.573 --> 00:18:11.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden there you are,\n\n362\n00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:14.290\nyour hard drive is gone or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n363\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.352\nWe talked about the multiple locations for\ndata concern, lack of transparency.\n\n364\n00:18:18.352 --> 00:18:20.921\nWe don't know what goes on\nin that data center, right,\n\n365\n00:18:20.921 --> 00:18:24.378\nI mean all we know is our data is in this\nmythical black box called the Cloud.\n\n366\n00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:27.703\nAnd we seemingly have access\nto it that's all we know.\n\n367\n00:18:27.703 --> 00:18:29.635\nBut really you stop and\nthink about what you do and\n\n368\n00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:32.280\ndon't know about the cloud\nprovider you do business with.\n\n369\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.950\nDo you know where their data centers are?\n\n370\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.940\nDo you know what kind of\nsecurity measures they take to\n\n371\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.070\nensure physical security\nin their data centers?\n\n372\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.770\nDo you know what kind of\nlogical measures they take?\n\n373\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.665\nDo you know what kind of background\nchecks they do on their employees?\n\n374\n00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:45.905\nIf they do them at all?\n\n375\n00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:49.943\nDo you know what kind of intake processing\nthey have for new customers to vet them\n\n376\n00:18:49.943 --> 00:18:53.453\nbefore they put them into the same\nhosting environments you're in?\n\n377\n00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:56.418\nDo you understand how they accept\ninbound shipments of equipment?\n\n378\n00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:58.785\nAnd how they vet that\nbefore they will set up and\n\n379\n00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:02.645\nallow that equipment to be essentially\nintegrated into the platform?\n\n380\n00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.950\nI mean these are things you\nhave no visibility into.\n\n381\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.503\nAnd rightly so, there's really no\nreason for you to know those things.\n\n382\n00:19:07.503 --> 00:19:11.839\nBut my point is you don't know a lot\nabout where you're putting your data, yet\n\n383\n00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:16.110\nwe freely just keep shoveling it out\nthere hoping that in there I guess you're\n\n384\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.414\ntrusting or a combination of\nboth I'm really not sure why.\n\n385\n00:19:19.414 --> 00:19:23.645\nClosing your eyes, spinning the roulette\nwheel of good fortune, whatever it maybe.\n\n386\n00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:27.790\nBut we are hoping that our data comes back\nhome and doesn't seem any worse for wear.\n\n387\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.760\nBut you think about the reality of it.\n\n388\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.500\nYou look at it this way,\n\n389\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.370\nit's the conversations I have\nwith customers all the time.\n\n390\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.240\nIf you have children you understand this.\n\n391\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.750\nWould you treat your children the same\nway you treat your Cloud data?\n\n392\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.160\nMeaning would you trust them to unknown\nthird parties and majority of the time\n\n393\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.570\nnot be involved in their direct care and\nassume that's a good idea?\n\n394\n00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.509\nMost of us would say no.\n\n395\n00:19:47.509 --> 00:19:48.640\nThat's clearly not a model we would like.\n\n396\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.376\n&gt;&gt; You get a pass on that.\n\n397\n00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, logically that does not work for\nmust of us that have children, right?\n\n398\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.700\nObviously that really\ndoesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n399\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.631\nPets, same thing, right?\n\n400\n00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:01.000\nYou're cat, dog lover,\nhey we got a model for you, right?\n\n401\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Would you do that?\n\n402\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:02.845\nThink about that.\n\n403\n00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:04.663\nIf you wouldn't do it for\nyou pets or your kids,\n\n404\n00:20:04.663 --> 00:20:07.340\nwhat makes you think it's a good\nidea to do it for your data?\n\n405\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.420\nYet we do this all the time without fail.\n\n406\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.020\nWithout even batting an eyelash or\nblinking an eye,\n\n407\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.140\nwe actually are lining up and\njust jumping for joy that we can do this.\n\n408\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.973\nIf you think about\nthe growth of the Cloud.\n\n409\n00:20:16.973 --> 00:20:21.366\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the single largest growth area\n\n410\n00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:25.270\nin IT year over year in\nterms of hosted services.\n\n411\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:30.110\nAnd the area of largest growth is\nthe use of those Cloud services for\n\n412\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.270\ncorporate data hosting,\nessentially off-prem private cloud.\n\n413\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.030\nYet we just assume it's all\ngonna magically work out.\n\n414\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.096\n&gt;&gt; It's like a torrid love affair that\nwe have with this Cloud business that's\n\n415\n00:20:41.096 --> 00:20:41.675\ngoing on.\n\n416\n00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:44.619\n&gt;&gt; It is just a wackadoodle [CROSSTALK]\nit's a wackadoodle model that's going on.\n\n417\n00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.565\n&gt;&gt; It's happening, you don't know what\nit going on, but man is it exciting?\n\n418\n00:20:48.565 --> 00:20:49.516\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n419\n00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:51.211\n&gt;&gt; It can end disastrously.\n\n420\n00:20:51.211 --> 00:20:52.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like the Cloud, don't get me wrong.\n\n421\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.480\nI mean,\nyou know you hear me speak about Cloud and\n\n422\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.260\nCloud security on a regular basis.\n\n423\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.159\nI'm an advocate of the use of the Cloud,\nI do not think the Cloud's a bad thing.\n\n424\n00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.200\n&gt;&gt; I do as well, I like it.\n\n425\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.139\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good but\n\n426\n00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:05.120\nI'm just pointing out when you\nmake it that's start a comparison.\n\n427\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.922\nI'm not saying that's a same thing to\nput your kids into this kind of a model.\n\n428\n00:21:08.922 --> 00:21:11.110\nI'm just pointing out as\ncrazy as that comparison is.\n\n429\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.375\nIf you wouldn't do it for something like\nthat then if you're gonna do it for data\n\n430\n00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:19.464\nwe gonna really step back and understand\na lot more about the requirements.\n\n431\n00:21:19.464 --> 00:21:23.400\nA lot more about the structure,\nthe functionality, the do's and dont's.\n\n432\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.773\nBecause unless we know that, we're really\nblindly choosing to do things that may or\n\n433\n00:21:27.773 --> 00:21:30.060\nmay not end well, is what I'm suggesting.\n\n434\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.544\nAnd that is a concern, confiscation of\nresource seen you multi environment,\n\n435\n00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:35.141\nwe've talked about this already.\n\n436\n00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:39.504\nErrors in management configuration of\ninfrastructure of the manifest portal,\n\n437\n00:21:39.504 --> 00:21:42.540\nexposing data in systems\nthat should not be exposed.\n\n438\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.900\nWe've seen this happen.\n\n439\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.190\nEvidence segregation in\nmulti-tenant environments.\n\n440\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.533\nSegregation in general multi-tenant\nenvironments is just a problem no\n\n441\n00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:51.077\nmatter what we do and how we do it.\n\n442\n00:21:51.077 --> 00:21:52.379\nWe gotta be thinking about that.\n\n443\n00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:56.240\nBoundaries, we talked about\ngeographic boundaries concerns there.\n\n444\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.250\nEstablishing and\nmaintaining an evidence chain of custody\n\n445\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.610\nis hard enough in the physical world where\nwe can actually encumber a resource.\n\n446\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.360\nWe have direct control over them.\n\n447\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.680\nWe can grab them,\nisolate them, properly tag and\n\n448\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.590\nbag and manage them,\nscore them and maintain them.\n\n449\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.884\nWhat about when it's in the cloud and\n\n450\n00:22:12.884 --> 00:22:14.939\nthe majority of those activities\nare beyond our control?\n\n451\n00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:17.254\nHow do you maintain or even establish?\n\n452\n00:22:17.254 --> 00:22:19.718\nLet alone maintain a chain\nof custody of evidence.\n\n453\n00:22:19.718 --> 00:22:23.125\nIncredibly challenging by today's\nstandards, decreased access and\n\n454\n00:22:23.125 --> 00:22:26.089\ndata control, your big issues there,\nwe talked about this.\n\n455\n00:22:26.089 --> 00:22:28.212\nHow do we image data,\nwe talked about that?\n\n456\n00:22:28.212 --> 00:22:29.705\nIt's very difficult to get that but\n\n457\n00:22:29.705 --> 00:22:32.960\nremember we don't back up our data\nin the Cloud, the Cloud provided us.\n\n458\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.600\nWe don't have access to the storage\narray where the backups are,\n\n459\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.730\nthe cloud provider does.\n\n460\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.570\nWe don't know how often\nthey're backing up.\n\n461\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.710\nI mean we know they're backing up at\nleast in theory should be backing up, but\n\n462\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.520\nwe don't know how often.\n\n463\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.528\nCould we find out?\n\n464\n00:22:44.528 --> 00:22:48.367\nWell in the theory in our terms of service\nit probably does tell us something about\n\n465\n00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.843\nthat, but do we know for sure?\n\n466\n00:22:49.843 --> 00:22:51.690\nAre we verifying it's happening?\n\n467\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.360\nYou ever tried to get a backup of your\nExchange Server data from Microsoft or\n\n468\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.350\na backup of your corporate data\nfrom Amazon or Salesforce?\n\n469\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.954\nYou could do that.\n\n470\n00:22:59.954 --> 00:23:03.336\nI'm not suggesting there's not\na mechanism to do that but it takes time.\n\n471\n00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:05.668\nIt's not like you just push a button and\nboom it's available,\n\n472\n00:23:05.668 --> 00:23:06.636\nthey have to generate it.\n\n473\n00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:09.548\nYes, that is a push button\nsolution typically.\n\n474\n00:23:09.548 --> 00:23:12.296\nBut if it's too big,\nthey cannot let you download it.\n\n475\n00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:16.300\nThey gotta put it on a hard drive in the\nold-fashioned way send it to you, right?\n\n476\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.369\nAnd again is it gonna be\nsecure during transit?\n\n477\n00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:21.633\nHow many times does UPS or\nFedEx lost a package, right?\n\n478\n00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:24.028\nNot saying that they are not\ngood at what they do but\n\n479\n00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:26.209\nthere's risk involved in everything we do.\n\n480\n00:23:26.209 --> 00:23:30.145\nExtrapolating that boundary of\ncontrol several companies out and\n\n481\n00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:31.415\nseveral layers out.\n\n482\n00:23:31.415 --> 00:23:35.121\nMeans there's a lot more risk involved\nin hand offs, system to system,\n\n483\n00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:37.210\nvendor to vendor, along the way.\n\n484\n00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.800\nIf the delivery mechanism for\nbacked up data is I'll put it in a box and\n\n485\n00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.940\nyou'll get it in five days,\nhere's a tracking number.\n\n486\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.685\nI'm not as excited about that\nas I would be about hey,\n\n487\n00:23:47.685 --> 00:23:50.191\nI'm gonna walk into that room,\nplug a drive in.\n\n488\n00:23:50.191 --> 00:23:53.278\nAnd when I come back in two hours\nI'm gonna have the copy of my data.\n\n489\n00:23:53.278 --> 00:23:56.228\nAnd by the way, someone's gonna stand\nat that door the entire time and\n\n490\n00:23:56.228 --> 00:23:57.581\nmake sure nobody goes in there.\n\n491\n00:23:57.581 --> 00:24:00.383\nThat way I'm pretty sure\nnothing's gonna happen.\n\n492\n00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:03.530\nAnd I've got a camera up in the corner\nthat's gonna watch that entire\n\n493\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.350\nactivity chain.\n\n494\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.980\nAnd it's gonna certify for\nme that nobody went in there and\n\n495\n00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.890\ndid anything while I'm making the copy.\n\n496\n00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.185\nI'm a lot happier about that from\na from a risk mitigation perspective.\n\n497\n00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:17.055\nThat I am about handing my hard drive\noff with a bunch of packing peanuts\n\n498\n00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:20.055\nto somebody who's going to throw\nit into the back of a truck.\n\n499\n00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:22.505\nAnd then jostle it around\non city streets for\n\n500\n00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:25.630\na few hours, until you decide\nto throw it on somebody's desk.\n\n501\n00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.720\nThat's just not the equivalent of\nwhat I'm going to be excited about.\n\n502\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.360\nAgain, this is just\nthe reality of what we see.\n\n503\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.930\nData availability is always the challenge.\n\n504\n00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.890\nWe've talked about this.\n\n505\n00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.480\nLocation of storage media.\n\n506\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.020\nWhere is it?\n\n507\n00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.730\nWe've talked about that.\n\n508\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.090\nInstead of where's Waldo.\n\n509\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.830\nWhere's my hard drive, right?\n\n510\n00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.080\nPut the little red cap on the hard drive-\n&gt;&gt; Who knows?\n\n511\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.420\n&gt;&gt; A little backpack, right, right?\n\n512\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.000\nDynamic storage, imaging,\nas we talked about, can be a challenge.\n\n513\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.420\nAll these things, resource extraction,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n514\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.420\nCryptographic key management,\nI spoke about this already.\n\n515\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.750\nData integrity, evidence preservation,\nspoke about this.\n\n516\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.120\nSpoke about the issues\nassociated with trust,\n\n517\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.840\nspoke about problems with control\nover data through logging.\n\n518\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.450\nSpoke about SLAs,\nservice level agreements.\n\n519\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.480\nOOAs, operational level agreements,\ninternal facing SLAs.\n\n520\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.500\nWhen you do private on-prem cloud,\nthe company is the IT provider and\n\n521\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.540\nthe cloud provider.\n\n522\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.360\nAnd you are essentially cloud\nservices through the guise of IT\n\n523\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.670\nback to the company.\n\n524\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.660\nYou host your own cloud\ninfrastructure in your own data center\n\n525\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.860\nyou are providing SLAs.\n\n526\n00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.980\nAt least you should be\nproviding SLAs to the company\n\n527\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.180\nto guarantee service provisioning and\nservice availability.\n\n528\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.510\nBut in the formal language of service\nmanagement we call those SLAs OLAs,\n\n529\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.970\noperational level agreements,\ninternal facing SLAs.\n\n530\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.000\nWhat about PLAs?\n\n531\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.330\nPrivacy level agreements.\n\n532\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.900\nBecoming more and more common today.\n\n533\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.940\nDealing with PII,\npersonally identifiable information, and\n\n534\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.510\nthe management of it in the cloud stack.\n\n535\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.080\nThis is an ongoing and\ncontinuing to emerge trend, but\n\n536\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.750\none that is becoming standardized\nin many systems today.\n\n537\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.220\nWe've talked about jurisdiction and\nthe concerns there.\n\n538\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.810\nGeopreference for hosting,\ntalked about that.\n\n539\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.270\nJurisdiction, remember, as your data\ntransits across borders, under sea cables\n\n540\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.450\nwherever they are, over land cables,\nwhatever, you move between one country and\n\n541\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:14.470\nanother you are moving between\njurisdictions and geography is a big deal.\n\n542\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.140\nBecause the minute that\ndata crosses that border,\n\n543\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.150\nit's not bound by\na different set of rules.\n\n544\n00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.590\nAnd it may only be resident in that\ncountry for five seconds as it moves\n\n545\n00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.360\nthrough, but for that five seconds,\nif that data is stopped, interdicted, or\n\n546\n00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.980\ncaptured, it may be essentially\nsubjected to the laws of that country.\n\n547\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.280\nTotally unrelated to the laws of where\nit came from, where it's going to.\n\n548\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.740\nAnd that can be an issue.\n\n549\n00:26:36.925 --> 00:26:38.580\nE-Discovery, we talked about\nthe challenges here and\n\n550\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.230\nwhy all these things are such\ndifficulties to deal with.\n\n551\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.930\nAgain, jurisdictional, right?\n\n552\n00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.550\nHow we follow the process and\nthe procedure.\n\n553\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.540\nWhat does it look like?\n\n554\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.160\nWhat kind of data are we entitled to?\n\n555\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.980\nWhat kind of data is off limits?\n\n556\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.620\nOne of the biggest challenges we\nhave with the discovery in the cloud\n\n557\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.740\nis the drafting of these search\nwarrants to these legal documents\n\n558\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.990\nthat the court will give you whatever\nthey're called, wherever they are.\n\n559\n00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.370\nAnd if they are too general or\ntoo broad versus too narrow and specific,\n\n560\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.670\nwe may be excluded or allowed to see\nthings that we're not supposed to see or\n\n561\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.520\nwe may need to see but we cannot.\n\n562\n00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.020\nIn the cloud we were worried about it too\nbroad e-Discovery process as we suggested\n\n563\n00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.260\nDaniel's data can gets\ncommingled with mine and\n\n564\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.600\nall that data gets grabbed because\npart of the investigation.\n\n565\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.270\nEven though Daniel's company has\nnothing to do with the investigation,\n\n566\n00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.240\ntheir data may be seized as\npart of a broad discovery.\n\n567\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.360\nWhere as if the warrant is too\nnarrowly defined we may not\n\n568\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.780\nbe able to get all the data pertinent\ntoo the investigation of this company.\n\n569\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.490\nBecause if the warrant may be\ndesigned in such as way that it says,\n\n570\n00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.710\nall data only in this system\nas opposed to in any systems\n\n571\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.240\nthat may contain that data\nwithin the provider network.\n\n572\n00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.750\nAnd because of just a subtle\nchange in language,\n\n573\n00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.920\nwe may be limited to only one copy or\nperhaps part of an instance.\n\n574\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.890\nIf we are cryptographically shredding data\nwe are gonna encrypt it, re-encrypt it,\n\n575\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.020\nand store it in ways we can't recover it,\nthat's good for us, but\n\n576\n00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.920\nif the court doesn't know that and\ndoesn't request the re-encryption keys,\n\n577\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.240\nwe may not be able to get you usable\ndata as part of the e-Discovery.\n\n578\n00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.080\nIf we're bit splitting and we're storing\ndata in multiple geographic locations and\n\n579\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.150\ndifferent stack copies to then\nreproduce it when needed on demand,\n\n580\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.340\nbut because it of it being scattered,\nit is more likely to survive,\n\n581\n00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.380\nnot only an attack, but\nalso a disaster related issue.\n\n582\n00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.700\nIt's harder to find the data,\nit's also harder to knock all it out.\n\n583\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.180\nAgain, if the court order doesn't\nspeak to that, we may only get\n\n584\n00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.680\nsome bits of the data and all of it\nis not available, so it's not usable.\n\n585\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.390\nAnd these are real life concerns when we\nthink about e-Discovery in the cloud.\n\n586\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.450\nWe've talked about the issues\nassociated with PII,\n\n587\n00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.740\npersonally identifiable information,\nDaniel's social security number,\n\n588\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.480\nmy medical history, your credit rating,\nwho knows what it is.\n\n589\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.410\nYou don't want that stuff being\ndiscussed at available broadly and\n\n590\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.940\nwe have to think about that and\nbe aware of that and understand that,\n\n591\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.400\nbecause that can lead to an issue.\n\n592\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.800\nSo again, that's something else that\nwe wanna think about and consider.\n\n593\n00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.460\nIdentifying account ownership,\nwho is ultimately responsible and\n\n594\n00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.040\ntherefore accountable for the account.\n\n595\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.270\nWho can give us rights.\n\n596\n00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.390\nThis can be confusing sometimes.\n\n597\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.580\nAccess control and\nof course training in competence,\n\n598\n00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.230\nas I've mentioned,\nthe cloud service provider's staff.\n\n599\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.180\nDo we know if these people are highly\ntrained that understand how to\n\n600\n00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.300\ndo their job well?\n\n601\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.670\nDo we know if they have\nnot been given training?\n\n602\n00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.090\nIf they're gonna do\nthe forensic investigation and\n\n603\n00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.940\nproduce the data under court order,\nwhat kind of skills do they have?\n\n604\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.120\nAre they a trained forensics investigator?\n\n605\n00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.440\nAre they just gonna go in and\nyank the hard drive and just say, hey,\n\n606\n00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.280\nokay here you go.\n\n607\n00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.830\nI don't know it's hard to say and neither\nare you and that's part of the problem.\n\n608\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.290\nSo these are kind of the master\nhit list of all the challenges, or\n\n609\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.080\nat least the majority.\n\n610\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.400\nNot all certainly it's not a comprehensive\nlist as we always point out.\n\n611\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.310\nThere's always more stuff\nthat you could put on there.\n\n612\n00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.680\nBut this is a pretty thorough hit\nlist of the high level issues and\n\n613\n00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.440\nconcerns we face with\nregards to cloud forensics.\n\n614\n00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.890\n&gt;&gt; Well there's definitely a litany\ngoing on here of complications,\n\n615\n00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.700\nconcerns that you may have to deal\nwith when it comes to working as\n\n616\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.070\na forensics investigator\nin a cloud environment.\n\n617\n00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.930\nSo we just have to keep those things\nin our mind and understand them,\n\n618\n00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.710\nhow they work how they're going to maybe\ncomplicate things for us so that we\n\n619\n00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:17.240\ncan move forward as smoothly as possible\nbut just know there are complications.\n\n620\n00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.450\nThat being said,\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n621\n00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.000\nWe're going to have to continue this\nconversation in another round so\n\n622\n00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.466\njoin us for part four on Cloud CHFI.\n\n623\n00:30:26.466 --> 00:30:27.314\n&gt;&gt; Woo!\nCloud four.\n\n624\n00:30:27.314 --> 00:30:30.294\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, all right everyone,\nthanks for joining us I've been your host,\n\n625\n00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:30.905\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n626\n00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:32.754\n&gt;&gt; I'm part four.\n\n627\n00:30:32.754 --> 00:30:33.362\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:30:33.362 --> 00:30:40.723\n[MUSIC]\n\n629\n00:30:40.723 --> 00:30:44.146\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.250\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.500\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.620\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n9\n00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.590\nin today's episode it's more\nof our CHFI Version 9 series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.915\nThis time with twice the versioning\nof the, at least four versions ago.\n\n11\n00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:29.640\n[LAUGH] And\njoining us in the studio yet again,\n\n12\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.980\nour good friend on that endeavor,\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.420\nAdam, welcome back man.\n\n14\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nwelcoming me back.\n\n15\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.150\nAlways glad to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.110\nBe here with you, be here with Daniel.\n\n17\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.701\nBe here in general,\njust being is a good thing, so.\n\n18\n00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:41.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.430\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna continue our conversations\nwith regards to the cloud forensics.\n\n20\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.580\nWe had just talked about in our last\nepisode in case you haven't seen it.\n\n21\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.820\nA list, a litany, if you will,\nof cloud forensics challenges.\n\n22\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.160\nAll sorts of things,\ndetails, considerations,\n\n23\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.340\nconcerns, that as investigators we have to\nbear in mind, we have to adjust for and\n\n24\n00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.480\nor, have knowledge of.\n\n25\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.120\nI thought we would jump back in and\n\n26\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.910\nperhaps deal with this from\na slightly different perspective.\n\n27\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.810\nTake a look at two of the very likely\nscenarios that you will come across,\n\n28\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.290\nwith regards to at some point.\n\n29\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250\nInvestigating cloud data,\nmeaning the use of one or\n\n30\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.720\nmore corporate storage mechanisms,\ncorporate networks,\n\n31\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.880\nare gonna have a variety of kinds\nof data associated with them today.\n\n32\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.624\nIt's very likely that you\nmay be storing files and\n\n33\n00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:27.240\nor employees in your organization,\nmaybe storing files.\n\n34\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.490\nUsing either Dropbox or Google Drive,\none or both, there's certainly others,\n\n35\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.590\nOne Drive, things like that,\nthings of that nature.\n\n36\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.880\nBut if we take a look at this,\nlittle bit of a deeper dive,\n\n37\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.225\njust a quick discussion on some of\nthe file locations, registry entries,\n\n38\n00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:46.100\nthings of that nature with regards to\nDropbox and Google Drive, give you a sense\n\n39\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.690\nsome of the things you may have to\nlook at when you're investigating.\n\n40\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.660\nMaybe valuable information for you,\nalso important for us to keep in mind that\n\n41\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.380\nfrom an exam perspective, we may be asked\nabout one or more of these services.\n\n42\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.390\nSo it would be good for us to,\nyou know, have a sense of that.\n\n43\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.850\nSo I thought it would be worth\njust couple minutes of our time,\n\n44\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.370\ndo a little bit of a deeper dive,\nboth with Dropbox and with Google Drive.\n\n45\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.470\nSo with Dropbox, we have a feature that's\ncalled EVH, extended version history,\n\n46\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.430\nis what they call it.\n\n47\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.270\nThis has the ability to\nsave all the deleted and\n\n48\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.752\nprevious versions of the files.\n\n49\n00:02:17.752 --> 00:02:21.890\nIt does so by default, and then allows\nyou to like most interfaces do, go in and\n\n50\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.910\nsee some sort of recovery option or\na deleted files option, to go in and\n\n51\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.120\nsee what's there, but\nit's called the EVH just so you know that.\n\n52\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.680\nThis is offered on different\nlevels of their service.\n\n53\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.681\nDrop offs, like many of the vendors in\nthe clouds today, has kind of a, hey,\n\n54\n00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:38.280\nyou can use it for\nfree version out there, right?\n\n55\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.720\nYou don't really pay, but you're not\ngetting a lot of additional benefits.\n\n56\n00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.260\nThere's the Dropbox pro variety or\nvariant,\n\n57\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260\nwhich is used by businesses traditionally,\nor users that have higher level needs.\n\n58\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.100\nMore storage, more capabilities,\nthings like that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.200\nThe free version stores the previous\nversion of the deleted files under EVH for\n\n60\n00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.000\n30 days.\n\n61\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.098\nThe pro variantor version will\nstored it for any length of time,\n\n62\n00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:02.920\nyou set a retention period for, so\nthere are some differences there.\n\n63\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.420\nAs an investigator,\nwe probably wanna be aware of that or\n\n64\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.490\nat least know, that that is the case.\n\n65\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.370\nWe can see versioning on different files.\n\n66\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.500\nGo through and recover against those files\nusing the EVH solution from Dropbox,\n\n67\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.110\nnot very difficult to do.\n\n68\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.470\nThe steps involved with doing it, may\nvary a little bit based on the version of\n\n69\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.560\nDropbox, and the time that you log in,\nversus what their API looks like, but\n\n70\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.070\ngenerically, you would log in most likely\nthrough the front end, the web front end.\n\n71\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.690\nYou would select the file option,\nusually over at the far right\n\n72\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.920\nside of the menu list, perhaps on\nthe left, again depending on versioning,\n\n73\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.174\nredesign, and\ngooey layout at any given moment in time,\n\n74\n00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:39.945\nbut at least as far as I know,\nthese days, it's on the right.\n\n75\n00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:41.015\nSo you would go up, do that,\n\n76\n00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:44.685\nright click on the file that you have,\nthat you want to recover.\n\n77\n00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:48.265\nThere should be a select previous\nversions option, from the drop down menu.\n\n78\n00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:50.768\nSo you'd imagine,\nhighlight a file, right click,\n\n79\n00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:53.097\nprevious version you would select that.\n\n80\n00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:55.127\nYou'll than be redirected out to,\n\n81\n00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:57.967\nwhere that history page is gonna\nbe associated with the file.\n\n82\n00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:01.327\nSo it's typically a different page that\ngets loaded and then you'll select\n\n83\n00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:05.477\na version from that list, maybe version\nthree, version four, whatever it is.\n\n84\n00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:08.007\nYou'll click the restore button and\nyou'll restore that version.\n\n85\n00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:10.140\nThat's essentially how\nyou bring that back up.\n\n86\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.810\nSo it's not very difficult to do, but\nit's again, something that, you know,\n\n87\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.850\nif you've never done, you're not using\nDropbox, maybe you're a big SkyDrive,\n\n88\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.970\nor OneDrive for Business fan,\nand you just don't use Dropbox.\n\n89\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.740\nYou may not know that.\n\n90\n00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.870\nSo you just wanna be aware of that,\nand have that in mind,\n\n91\n00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.885\nI use a variety different platforms, but\n\n92\n00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.625\nI traditionally will use Sky drive for\nbusiness more so than other stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:33.385\nSo just for me something that i would have\nto think about and perhaps go and look at,\n\n94\n00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.525\nbefore I do,\nbecause I may not be confident about it.\n\n95\n00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.155\nSo just something to consider and\nto be aware of, if you will.\n\n96\n00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:40.144\nYou use DropBox.\n\n97\n00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:44.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally use DropBox, I like\nDropBox, nothing wrong with getting some\n\n98\n00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:47.523\nfree storage and I like to put things\nin a multitude of different areas,\n\n99\n00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:49.402\na little diversification on my part.\n\n100\n00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:53.326\nI like to aggregate all the free\nstorage available to me,\n\n101\n00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.790\n[LAUGH] as one big storage facility.\n\n102\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.752\n&gt;&gt; Dining from the multi-vendor buffet.\n\n103\n00:04:57.752 --> 00:04:58.694\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a tapest of storage.\n\n104\n00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.030\nI got it.\n\n105\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.560\n&gt;&gt; A tapestry.\n\n106\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.890\n&gt;&gt; A little bit here,\na little bit there, yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.907\nTake a terabyte over there,\na gigabyte over here.\n\n108\n00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you,\nI'll take that, good stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Amazon actually just recently got\nrid of their unlimited data storage.\n\n110\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.230\n&gt;&gt; Did they really?\n\n111\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.360\n&gt;&gt; On the consumer side.\n\n112\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.300\nYou now have to pay.\n\n113\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.710\nThey had that package for\na long time where,\n\n114\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.840\nI think it was two years\nwhen they first started.\n\n115\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.704\nThey put it out for about two years, but\nthey had said basically unlimited for\n\n116\n00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:23.867\nx, and everybody else is doing this pay a\ncertain amount, get a certain amount kind\n\n117\n00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:27.673\nof thing, and they just came out and\nannounced, in the last week actually,\n\n118\n00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:30.943\nthat they're doing away with\nthe all you can eat free unlimited,\n\n119\n00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:34.392\nnot free, but unlimited, and\nthat they're gonna start charging,\n\n120\n00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:37.860\n$50 a year for a terabyte, or\nwhatever the going rate is.\n\n121\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.510\nBut they're gonna get in line\nwith everybody else, so yeah.\n\n122\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.280\n&gt;&gt; I guess they were feeling they were\nmissing out on that piece of that pie?\n\n123\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.980\n&gt;&gt; You know, I'm guessing it's probably\na revenue driven thing, I would think.\n\n124\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.810\nI mean obviously, if they're giving you\nunlimited storage for whatever that dollar\n\n125\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.510\nvalue was, they're clearly missing upsell\nopportunities as you want more storage,\n\n126\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.632\nso I guess yeah,\nmaybe it was probably revenue driven.\n\n127\n00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.570\n&gt;&gt; And even if they charge half of\nwhat their competitors are charging,\n\n128\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.700\nthey're still making more money than\nit was before, because it was free.\n\n129\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was unlimited.\n\n130\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.550\n&gt;&gt; It was unlimited.\n\n131\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.660\n&gt;&gt; For an initial price.\n\n132\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.510\n&gt;&gt; And it'll drive-\n&gt;&gt; Keep eating until we\n\n133\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.370\nrun out of food right?\n\n134\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love the competition\nbetween the guys right?\n\n135\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.460\nThat's awesome stuff.\n\n136\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah it's just interesting,\nI thought it was kinda cool.\n\n137\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.140\nSo when we think about Dropbox, we think\nabout installing the client software.\n\n138\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.330\nIn Windows 10 it's in the program files,\n\n139\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.940\ntypically program files x86\n&gt;&gt; Dropbox sub-directory there is where\n\n140\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.560\nyou would find it, the default folder\nthat we use on the Windows 10 client for\n\n141\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.740\nsyncing, will be the C: Drive designation,\nwhatever drive you're installed in,\n\n142\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.620\nthe users directory under your username\nname, so under Adam, let's say,\n\n143\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.870\nthere's a Dropbox folder.\n\n144\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.610\nThat's where I find my synced files,\njust so you know that.\n\n145\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.720\nBut we will obviously have a copy of\nwhatever files have been uploaded or\n\n146\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.350\ndownloaded against that client,\nlocally on the machine.\n\n147\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.500\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n148\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.530\nWe do have some registry keys\nthat are going to be there,\n\n149\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.030\nif you wanna take a look\nhere really quick with me.\n\n150\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.970\nI'll show you a list.\n\n151\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.270\nWe can go full screen just to see those.\n\n152\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.970\nWe'll show you a list of the registry\nkeys that are going to be\n\n153\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.310\npart of an installation,\nof Dropbox in a Windows environment.\n\n154\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.600\nYou'll see them listed here.\n\n155\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.750\nAll six of them.\n\n156\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.580\nWe do have, let me just move out of\nthe way, so the DOS prompt is not\n\n157\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.040\ndoing the same thing, as my little\nbox in box when we're talking to you.\n\n158\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.415\nSo you can see we have the HKLM\nthe HKEY local machine,\n\n159\n00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:22.195\nHIVE is where all these things are going\nto be found, most of them are in software.\n\n160\n00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:25.405\nFirst one is in system,\ncurrent control set,\n\n161\n00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:29.130\nservices shared access parameters\nfirewall policy, firewall rules.\n\n162\n00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.274\nThat opens up the ports and the\ncommunications pathways for us to Dropbox.\n\n163\n00:07:33.274 --> 00:07:38.192\nHKLM software, Microsoft,\nWindows current version explorer,\n\n164\n00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:43.547\nShell icon overlay, identifiers,\ndrop box txt, open parenthesis and\n\n165\n00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:48.903\nlower case, close parenthesis that\ngives us our Dropbox Information,\n\n166\n00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:54.286\nand allows us to see the icons, and\nthings we need to shop on the desktop.\n\n167\n00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:58.585\nWe have a software Microsoft Windows\ncurrent version uninstall Dropbox,\n\n168\n00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:01.176\nprobably figure out what that does, right,\n\n169\n00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:06.153\nand we have the software class is Dropbox\nupdate period or update .process launcher,\n\n170\n00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.772\nthat actually allows us\nto run the software.\n\n171\n00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:12.057\nWe have the Dropbox install path,\nthat may be important for\n\n172\n00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:15.670\nus to know that way we can see\nwhether it's installed by default or\n\n173\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.482\nperhaps modified, not saying that now,\nwhere we necessarily go and\n\n174\n00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:23.520\nmasquerade is Dropbox now,\nwe're box instead of dropbox that kind of.\n\n175\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Like what we have the modified person\n\n176\n00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:28.060\nof Dropbox, but you know what\nwould be good to just verify and\n\n177\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.599\nvalidate the install path,\nand Dropbox client version.\n\n178\n00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:33.543\nThat's how we would tell a version\nof the software is running, so\n\n179\n00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:35.290\nwe know what's going on there.\n\n180\n00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.260\nDo have, if we stay on the screens,\nsome other files I wanna share with you.\n\n181\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.670\nWe have our config database,\n\n182\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.670\nwhere we actually store\nthe configuration information.\n\n183\n00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.130\nThis is our local installation\nconfiguration, our file cache db,\n\n184\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.000\nwhere we have information\nabout file cache.\n\n185\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.303\nOur sic store db, there are some\ndatabase files that are created.\n\n186\n00:08:51.303 --> 00:08:54.770\nSo I just wanna share those with you,\nmake sure we're comfortable with them.\n\n187\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.330\nLet's start with config.db,\nI'll just roll up one at a time, so\n\n188\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.280\nwe could see them here.\n\n189\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.400\nYou could see the path form,\nsee users, user name, app data,\n\n190\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.110\nlocal Dropbox instance.\n\n191\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.080\nIt is used for information about\nthe local Dropbox install and\n\n192\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.250\nthe accounts, the version information,\n\n193\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.535\nbuild information,\nthings like that are all gonna be there.\n\n194\n00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:19.400\nConfig.dbx is an encrypted\nvariant of the config.db.\n\n195\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.310\nSo, if you see config.dbx,\n\n196\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.020\nwe have an encrypted variant of\nthe database, just so you know.\n\n197\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.500\nWe have file cache and\nsigstore, there's also host db.\n\n198\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.120\nJust put those up so\nwe can kinda go through those.\n\n199\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.340\nFilecache db, see the path there, contains\nseveral columns for the file journal.\n\n200\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.660\nThis contains the list of all the files\nin the directories, so we keep\n\n201\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.254\ntrack of everything, just to make sure\nwe know where stuff is and what it is.\n\n202\n00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:49.990\nSigstore.db, that is our typically\nshy 256, but whatever our hashing\n\n203\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.750\nalgorithms may be, our hashes and the file\nsize information associated with them.\n\n204\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.940\nVery important database for us,\nperhaps to forensically recover, and\n\n205\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.890\nvalidate the hashes on the files\nversus what we see the files as being.\n\n206\n00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.920\nWe'd re-run the hashes to ensure they are\naccurate, Maybe somebody modified a file\n\n207\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.330\nand we'll be able to tel,l based on\nthe disparity between those hashes, right?\n\n208\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.150\nOr the diversification\nas you were suggesting.\n\n209\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.190\nFine sir, right?\n\n210\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.218\nSo it could be that as well.\n\n211\n00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:16.780\nA host DB,\n\n212\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.250\nthat's a plain text file that contains\nthe hash values of our user names.\n\n213\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.960\nWanna find out who's been logged in\nin the Dropbox off that machine?\n\n214\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.460\nWell we would have hashes.\n\n215\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.490\nCross reference those against the user\nnames we pull from the local user manager,\n\n216\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.260\nand we could see which accounts\nwere used and as a result,\n\n217\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.440\nvalidate that we have\nthe right information.\n\n218\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.760\nMaybe there was an account that was used\nthat's not recorded or is not obvious,\n\n219\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.530\ncuz maybe the account has been removed.\n\n220\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.680\nA lot of times, you may have\na user account that gets deleted,\n\n221\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.130\nand unless we know to go look for evidence\nof that, we may not cross-reference\n\n222\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.730\nthat account with things that\nare going on, like access to files.\n\n223\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.300\nMaybe somebody uploaded\na bunch of files and\n\n224\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.570\nthen deleted the user account\nto cover their tracks.\n\n225\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.520\nHard to say, right?\n\n226\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.430\nSo again,\nyou've got to think about these things.\n\n227\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.660\nSo we have some additional ones here.\n\n228\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.490\nWe have uplink DB and Dropbox.cash.\n\n229\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.750\nLet's take a look at these, again database\nis associated with the use of Dropbox.\n\n230\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.850\nI've given you the past statements for\nall these.\n\n231\n00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.570\nMaybe important to know what they are.\n\n232\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.380\nShould probably take note of them.\n\n233\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.220\nYeah, never know.\n\n234\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.880\nYou might get one of those questions.\n\n235\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.550\nHey, where's that up-link db,\ndatabase traditionally located?\n\n236\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.810\nRight?\nSo, you wanna know that if\n\n237\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.920\nyou're studying for the exam.\n\n238\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.060\nThe binary database files, the uplink db,\n\n239\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.940\nthe dead Dropbox.cash and yes that\nis the way it is going to be seen,\n\n240\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.230\nby the way, it's not a typo, the file\nname or the location we are looking for,\n\n241\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.740\nrather, the item we are looking for is\nwhat I suggest, the cash is .dropbox.cash.\n\n242\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.240\nSo, make sure you know that,\n\n243\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.840\nif asked about that would be one of\nthose little oopsies that you make and\n\n244\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.022\nget it wrong because you think\nit can't be .dropbox.cache.\n\n245\n00:11:46.022 --> 00:11:48.940\nThat's silly right,\neverybody else is something dot something.\n\n246\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.530\nThat must be wrong, but that actually is\nthe name that we would look for there.\n\n247\n00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.370\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n248\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.860\n&gt;&gt; It's like a hidden file in Linux.\n\n249\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.860\n&gt;&gt; It's a hidden file yeah exactly.\n\n250\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.510\nThat's what it is,\nyou can see right there.\n\n251\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.330\nSame idea.\n\n252\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.950\nHidden directory located at\nthe root of the Dropbox folder.\n\n253\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.730\nIt's essentially a staging platform for\nupload and download.\n\n254\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.240\nIt's where, as the name implies,\n\n255\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.010\nall the files are cached as they're\nbeing moved in and out of the system.\n\n256\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.140\nRemember, we want to see\nwhat's going on in the cache.\n\n257\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.910\nThis is dynamic data and may be of\nvalue to us, so we want to know that.\n\n258\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.160\nI'll put a little, how do I clear the\nDropbox cache in Windows and Linux url,\n\n259\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.840\ndown there for you.\n\n260\n00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.420\nIt may be interesting for you to go read\nthe primer on that, as an investigator,\n\n261\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.770\nhave a sense of the kind of\nthings bad actors make it up to,\n\n262\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.320\nand what they can do there.\n\n263\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.060\nSo just again, something to consider,\nand to think about.\n\n264\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.510\nSo, you got that, I'm going to\ncontinue on with our comparison here.\n\n265\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.880\nWe got Google Drive.\n\n266\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.280\nSo I thought we'd just throw the kind of\nequivalent up on Google Drive quickly.\n\n267\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.170\nShow you some stuff there.\n\n268\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.140\nDefault location as you can see.\n\n269\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.640\nDefault user used for sync.\n\n270\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.330\nIt's essentially the same idea\nof the default folder route.\n\n271\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.090\nSame idea, except we're substituting\nGoogle Drive for Dropbox.\n\n272\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.230\nIt's basically the same idea.\n\n273\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.750\nThe drive, Google Drive and install\nregister keys, you could find them here,\n\n274\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.730\nyou'll see them should obviously go in,\nmake sure you are familiar with those.\n\n275\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.240\nGot a couple of them there,\nnotice they're both in software,\n\n276\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.560\nboth Microsoft Windows current version,\nright?\n\n277\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.092\nInstaller folders and\nrun Google drive SNHKU HKCU, right?\n\n278\n00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:09.949\nWoops, hold on one second,\nthat was silly, there that's better,\n\n279\n00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:11.683\nright okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:12.437\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what we need and\n\n281\n00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:13.458\nthat one right there, all right?\n\n282\n00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.413\nThere we go.\n\n283\n00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:18.326\nOkay now, that's what I get for\ncopying into the notes, and\n\n284\n00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:20.800\nnot paying attention when I did that.\n\n285\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.094\nWe got two registry keys, that actually\nshould have been four, that looks better,\n\n286\n00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:28.962\nand make sure you have that setup the\nright way in the notes [CROSSTALK] Again,\n\n287\n00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:32.374\nQA, my issue when I copied them over,\nI was not paying attention.\n\n288\n00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:33.980\nAll right so you have those right?\n\n289\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.581\nSo you can see where they are.\n\n290\n00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:38.992\nThe software keys, Google Drive classes,\nWindows current version,\n\n291\n00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:43.410\nrun Google drive sync and\ninstall our folder, so we have all those.\n\n292\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.570\nWe have some databases again here, so you\ncould see the sync underscore config DB.\n\n293\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.150\nRight, that's a database file for the\ndrive client, that contains information\n\n294\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.205\nabout the Google drive version, the local\nscynch path, user's email address,\n\n295\n00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:59.770\nagain that may be valuable for forensic\ninformation we'd wanna be aware of there,\n\n296\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.300\njust to make sure we know that,\nhave access to it.\n\n297\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.870\nHey, is it really this user?\n\n298\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.110\nOr again, was there a ghost account?\n\n299\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.505\nSomething somebody was doing, and\n\n300\n00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:10.055\nmaybe making it appear as if there were\nsomebody else, just be aware of that.\n\n301\n00:14:10.055 --> 00:14:12.595\nWe could take a look at\nthe database files in general, or\n\n302\n00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:15.375\nany of these database files,\nby using a browser,\n\n303\n00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:19.535\nsomething like SQLite tools could be used\nto extract the required information.\n\n304\n00:14:19.535 --> 00:14:24.065\nIn the prior discussions in our\ndatabase forensics episodes,\n\n305\n00:14:24.065 --> 00:14:26.395\nwe actually demonstrated\nthis kind of a tool and\n\n306\n00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:29.745\nshowed you how to dump the contents\nof a database using this tool.\n\n307\n00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:30.871\nSo if you haven't seen those episodes,\n\n308\n00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.900\nI definitely encourage you to go back and\ntake a look.\n\n309\n00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.070\nNot necessarily the Google Drive database\nor one of the Dropbox databases,\n\n310\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.170\nbut just a database, but doesn't really\nmatter where the data comes from.\n\n311\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.480\nThe concept is the same,\nthe tool use is the same.\n\n312\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.200\nWe actually walked you through\nthat as a hands on demonstration\n\n313\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.120\nof how to interrogate a drive file or\ndatabase file,\n\n314\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.550\nrather, and find information\nby using the tool like this.\n\n315\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.010\nSo it would be important for\nyou to just go in and take a look.\n\n316\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.440\nThere's also a sync log,\n.log that is created here for\n\n317\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.140\nGoogle Drive, and we can go in and\nparse that sync log looking for strings.\n\n318\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.390\nI've shown you several different episodes,\nthe reasons why and\n\n319\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.840\nmechanisms associated\nwith string-searching.\n\n320\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.640\nBut the reasons why string-searches are so\n\n321\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.300\nimportant, because we can find pieces of\ninformation that may be valuable, and\n\n322\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.850\nthere are some strings that\ncould aid our search here.\n\n323\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.250\nRAWEVENT[CREATE, DELETE or MODIFY,\nyou would search for these strings and\n\n324\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.010\nby doing that, you'll find\nevidence of activities in the log,\n\n325\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.810\nstarting with those items in\nthen whatever comes after,\n\n326\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.770\nwould be data that would be valuable for\ncreation, deletion or modification event.\n\n327\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.930\nSo you may want to go and\ntake a look at those, will be valuable for\n\n328\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.680\nyou to have a sense of how to just go\nthrough the mechanics of the forensics,\n\n329\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.660\nsetup, the structure, the investigation,\nthe targets that we wanna use,\n\n330\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.790\nin terms of the databases, and\nthe methodologies, in this case,\n\n331\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:52.060\ndumping the database files, and doing\nsome string searches as a result of that.\n\n332\n00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.440\nIn the discussion in the episode,\nwhere we did the memory capture and\n\n333\n00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.330\nthe memory dump, right, the raw memory\ndump, and I used just a simple Hex editor,\n\n334\n00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.450\ndid its string search, Ctrl+F, to find and\nuse the word windows, as a string.\n\n335\n00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.540\nYou saw that we found\nmultiple instances of that.\n\n336\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.710\nThat's really what we're talking about,\njust looking for those ideas and\n\n337\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.260\nthen validating the data that\ncomes after it as a result.\n\n338\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Very good stuff.\n\n339\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.440\nNow we should be much more well versed\nin both Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\n340\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.486\nA lot of great information there and\nhow we can forensically work with\n\n341\n00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:26.271\nthose to cloud storage providers,\nand then also integrate the,\n\n342\n00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:31.752\nI'm losing my mind here, the HKLMs,\nthe local machine inside the hives,\n\n343\n00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:36.366\n[CROSSTALK] That is a very important\nkind of thing for us to know.\n\n344\n00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:38.606\nSo make sure to make\nyourself some flash cards,\n\n345\n00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:42.246\nwhatever you need to do to remember all\nthese things buried into the brain, so\n\n346\n00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:45.718\nthat you don't do like I just did and\ncan't forget, or can't remember,\n\n347\n00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:48.770\nwhen it's actually happening\nfive seconds away from there.\n\n348\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.552\nMy brain is.\n\n349\n00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Just one thing-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n350\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.072\n&gt;&gt; That, I know that\n\n351\n00:16:51.072 --> 00:16:52.785\nwe point this out in other episodes but\n\n352\n00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:54.915\nto remind you especially since you and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n353\n00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:56.245\n&gt;&gt; And I appreciate you going out the way\n\n354\n00:16:56.245 --> 00:16:59.035\nto call out the importance\nof the registry keys, right?\n\n355\n00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:02.375\nBut do keep in mind,\nthose register keys that I share with you,\n\n356\n00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.432\nare the ones associated with\nthe Windows 10, on the deployment, or\n\n357\n00:17:05.432 --> 00:17:07.152\nthe installation in\na Windows 10 environment.\n\n358\n00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:12.371\nIf you go back to earlier versions of\nthe OS, maybe Windows 7, Windows 8, 8.1,\n\n359\n00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:16.070\nWindows 8.1 is probably gonna be about\nthe same, if not the same as Windows 10.\n\n360\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.250\nI'm not suggesting they are or\nnot the same in Windows 7,\n\n361\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.950\nI'm just pointing out they could vary.\n\n362\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.420\nI am pointing out that going\nforward beyond Windows 10,\n\n363\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.838\nwhile they may stay\nthe same they could vary.\n\n364\n00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:29.320\nAnd so, you'll keep in mind that\nthose kind of things that are OS or\n\n365\n00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.530\nPlatform specific, must be researched and\nverified by Platform, that's\n\n366\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.480\npart of your responsibility, the due care,\ndue diligence aspects we talked about.\n\n367\n00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.412\nBecause, yeah you could jump in and\n\n368\n00:17:39.412 --> 00:17:40.761\ngo well,\nthey're gonna be where they always are.\n\n369\n00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:41.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:43.401\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying they're\ngonna screw something up, but\n\n371\n00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:44.980\nyou're gonna waste time and effort.\n\n372\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.507\nYou may inadvertently modify data,\nby going into a registry key or\n\n373\n00:17:49.507 --> 00:17:53.710\nlooking if the equivalent of that\nsomewhere in the system, where there\n\n374\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.180\nis something different there, and again,\nyou just got to be thinking, right?\n\n375\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.890\nThe goals are, be forensically sound,\nbe methodical, be on point, right?\n\n376\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.670\nDon't waste time,\ndon't take activities out of context,\n\n377\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.617\ndon't do things that\nare not going to add value.\n\n378\n00:18:07.617 --> 00:18:10.095\nGet in, do what you need to do,\nand get out.\n\n379\n00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:12.694\nEvery second you spend in\nthat box looking at data,\n\n380\n00:18:12.694 --> 00:18:16.623\nis another second you potentially can\nmodify something, and, as a result,\n\n381\n00:18:16.623 --> 00:18:20.976\nhave a problem with the efficacy of that\nevidence, and so, you wanna minimize that,\n\n382\n00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:23.960\nif possible,\nalways verify those registry keys.\n\n383\n00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.880\nWe give you the baseline here because we\nwant you to understand what they are.\n\n384\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.360\nBy version, at the time,\nwe put the content together.\n\n385\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.390\nBut you know you may have to\nexcercise a little smarts, right?\n\n386\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.450\nAnd go out and look for that, especially\nif we are one or two versions down,\n\n387\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.960\nfrom where this content may\nhave originally been created.\n\n388\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.290\nIf there's a Windows,\nwell, they'll skip 13,\n\n389\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.220\nif there's a Windows 14 out there\nright now while you're watching this,\n\n390\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.770\nthen you know, Windows 10 may not be\nthe baseline you want to reference.\n\n391\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.280\nReference the more updated stuff.\n\n392\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.850\nDo what we do.\n\n393\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.760\nAll you do is go out and\neither install it and capture it and\n\n394\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.150\nunderstand it and/or, go out and\nlook it up from the vendor documentation.\n\n395\n00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.040\nThere's so many ways to find that data.\n\n396\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.710\nYou gotta put in the time and the energy.\n\n397\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.610\nThat doesn't mean it's not worthwhile when\nyou actually get that information, and\n\n398\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.790\nas a result apply it the right way,\n\n399\n00:19:03.790 -->

You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:14.014\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.670\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.395\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with,\n\n7\n00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.414\nyou guessed it, CHFI version 9.\n\n8\n00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:29.230\nAnd joining us yet again,\nyou guess it yet again, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.680\nAdam, welcome back man, how is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.263\n&gt;&gt; I want you to be able to do that\nlike sports announcement thing.\n\n11\n00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:35.797\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know the guy that does the crazy\n\n12\n00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:38.879\nlong-held intro, the one who sounds like-\n&gt;&gt; Michael Buffer.\n\n13\n00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.086\n&gt;&gt; I guess if that's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; He does the boxing [INAUDIBLE]\n\n14\n00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:42.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Let's get ready to rumble.\n\n16\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like super long drawn out.\n\n17\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.750\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you do that?\n\n18\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.345\nFigure that out.\n\n19\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.161\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we need to do that.\n\n20\n00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.965\nThat would be cool.\n\n21\n00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or get somebody off camera to do it.\n\n22\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.960\nWe can just have it\ndone on the background.\n\n23\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.724\nYou kind of hear rippling through.\n\n24\n00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:56.559\nActually this is our random site, but\nthis one is actually really cool,\n\n25\n00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.940\nunlike some of the ones you do\nwhich are just totally random.\n\n26\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.150\nThis one's actually interesting.\n\n27\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.967\nSo I know you're into music a lot, right?\n\n28\n00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.418\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about this.\n\n29\n00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:06.550\nSo the 50th anniversary of\nSergeant Peppers was recent.\n\n30\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.270\n&gt;&gt; Was that recent, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.693\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, last week, actually.\n\n32\n00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.025\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; Half a century.\n\n33\n00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a seminal landmark,\nand I'm probably [CROSSTALK]\n\n34\n00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Top of the-\n\n35\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.565\n&gt;&gt; Greatest albums of all times list?\n\n36\n00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.744\n&gt;&gt; It's the number one on, not only on the\nRolling Stones list, but on many lists,\n\n37\n00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:25.109\nbut I mean just technically from the, just\nthe smiting involved to put it together,\n\n38\n00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.080\none of the most important\nalbums that was ever recorded.\n\n39\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.630\nI mean, just a massively imported piece or\ncollection of pieces of music.\n\n40\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.090\nBut I saw a really interesting documentary\nin PBS about the 50th anniversary\n\n41\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.940\nthat I forgot to mention.\n\n42\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.300\nCuz we're having a chat about things\nI've seen and things that are cool.\n\n43\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.740\nBut I thought this was actually\nreally neat as we get into this,\n\n44\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.090\nbecause the technicality and they broke\ndown the technicalities some of the songs\n\n45\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.820\nthat I kinda wanted to talk about to\neach one, which I know you would enjoy.\n\n46\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.240\nBut they talked about the fact that\nall the different contributors.\n\n47\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.018\nThe fact that George Harrison\nbrought in this Indian overlay.\n\n48\n00:01:58.018 --> 00:01:58.568\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n49\n00:01:58.568 --> 00:01:59.117\n&gt;&gt; The music.\n\n50\n00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n51\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.110\n&gt;&gt; And just the technicality\ninvolved with doing that.\n\n52\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.930\nBut with regards to that announcer thing.\n\n53\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600\nSo the last A Day in the Life.\n\n54\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.844\nThe last song on the end of the album,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:07.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Side b.\n\n56\n00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:10.100\nVery famous song, in it's own right.\n\n57\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.470\nBut the way that they did that, and\nthe techniques they used at the time,\n\n58\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.200\nthis is remember, this is back in 1967,\nwhen they shopped this album, right,\n\n59\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.090\n50 years ago,\nwas ground breaking at the time.\n\n60\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.240\nBecause the way that\nPaul McCartney figured out and\n\n61\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.400\nJohn Lennon figure out how to shoot or\n\n62\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030\nhow to record rather, the ending to\nthis where they have the piano chord.\n\n63\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.520\nAnd we talk about how hard it is to\nplace certain things and get it right.\n\n64\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.390\nSo chords will fade or you know this.\n\n65\n00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.870\nEverybody else knows this as well.\n\n66\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.830\nSo that piano chord is held for\na ridiculously long time.\n\n67\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.910\nIf you listen, 43 seconds.\n\n68\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.180\n&gt;&gt; That's a ridiculously long time.\n\n69\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.370\n&gt;&gt; And that is not a single piano.\n\n70\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.960\nThey use nine different pianos\noverlaid on top of each other.\n\n71\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.460\nSeven acoustics and\n\n72\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.630\na couple of electric pianos at\nthe time to be able to record that.\n\n73\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.310\nAnd the way they did it,\n\n74\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.530\nthey did interesting little phase\nshifting They heard them all play and\n\n75\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.830\nthey had them do this and\nactually Ringo plays one of the pianos.\n\n76\n00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.788\nThey work with this whole thing\nbehind this, it's really cool, and\n\n77\n00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:07.961\nthen they record them all,\n\n78\n00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.086\nthey run them on separate tracks which\nat the time was like no small feed.\n\n79\n00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:14.762\nAnd then they use the volume faders to\nbring them up so they were fading so\n\n80\n00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:19.016\nthey would continuously move through them,\nto hold them for that amount of time.\n\n81\n00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:21.256\n[CROSSTALK] ground breaking at the time,\nit was never done before.\n\n82\n00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:24.750\nIt was just wickedly\nhard to do apparently.\n\n83\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.060\n&gt;&gt; And it just a little,\nwell obviously [INAUDIBLE]\n\n84\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.131\n&gt;&gt; Just a different approach.\n\n85\n00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:28.932\n[INAUDIBLE] thinking through.\n\n86\n00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:31.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thinking outside the box.\n\n87\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.000\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n88\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.699\nwhich is a great way to segue into our\nnew revival of the Beetles, sorry.\n\n89\n00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n90\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.933\nto get into a new distinct about that file\nprocess but from a different perspective,\n\n91\n00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.450\napply that for\nour discussions about malware.\n\n92\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.926\nThe thing that is very difficult for us as\nsecurity professionals, as investigators,\n\n93\n00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:51.735\nas the people on the right side of this\nequation, with regards to malware,\n\n94\n00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:55.970\nis the fact that the malware creators,\nthe people that are writing this code.\n\n95\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.290\nIf they're good at what they do or\nthinking outside the box.\n\n96\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.190\nAnd it's a common theme that we have to\nkeep coming back to, because it allows\n\n97\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.350\nthem to come up with innovative ways to\nfigure out how to hide that malware and\n\n98\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.790\nhave it execute without us finding it.\n\n99\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.440\nAnd if you think about the logic of this.\n\n100\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.709\nIf you do the same thing over and\nover and over again, right,\n\n101\n00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.236\nyou're gonna be found out eventually.\n\n102\n00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:17.210\nI mean this is why we tend to find a lot\nof malware and have success at finding it,\n\n103\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.464\nbecause it looks very similar to\neverything that came before and\n\n104\n00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:23.230\nit operates essentially\nin a very similar way.\n\n105\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.240\nBut we have categories in malware today.\n\n106\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.218\nI speak about these in other shows,\npolymorphic malware for instance,\n\n107\n00:04:29.218 --> 00:04:33.799\nwhich is incredibly nasty, nasty stuff\nthat changes its entire thought process.\n\n108\n00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.063\nHow it executes,\nthe files that make it up and\n\n109\n00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:39.830\nthe way it works every time it executes\nand recompiles and changes itself.\n\n110\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.010\nAnd if you think about totally being\nable to morph and change your identity,\n\n111\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.590\nevery single time you're operating,\nhow are we gonna defend against that?\n\n112\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.840\nHow are we even gonna investigate that and\nfind the evidence that there's malware?\n\n113\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.470\nIt's gonna be different every time.\n\n114\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.340\nThis is like the true concept around the\nidea of a one time, or one pad execution.\n\n115\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.376\nWhere every time it's different, we'd\nhave to quarantine the entire system and\n\n116\n00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:02.470\nsay essentially everything\nin there is suspect.\n\n117\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.350\nBecause we don't know what's good or\n\n118\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.040\nwhat's bad, from an investigatory\nstand point in other words, right?\n\n119\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.450\nWould be very difficult for us to know.\n\n120\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.600\nSo there are malware variance,\nderivatives out there\n\n121\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.960\nthat can be incredibly complicated for\nus to work with.\n\n122\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.390\nThis is a sub-area of specialty for many\nsecurity professionals that do this work.\n\n123\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.840\nThey tend to focus in this area and\n\n124\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.980\nperhaps focus on it to the exclusion\nof a lot of other areas,\n\n125\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.510\nbecause it is such a difficult area to\nreally understand and to do well with.\n\n126\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.060\nIt's not hard to learn the basics,\n\n127\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.920\nand we're not gonna go into\nincredible detail here.\n\n128\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.910\nYou need to go and\nreally spend a lot of time and\n\n129\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.890\nspend years doing this to\nreally become expert at it.\n\n130\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.310\nBut we're gonna scratch the surface.\n\n131\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.744\nBut my point is people that\nspecialize in this, if you talk\n\n132\n00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:45.753\nto them will tell you that takes a lot\nof time and a lot of book smarts.\n\n133\n00:05:45.753 --> 00:05:49.208\nAnd then a lot of real world experience to\nunderstand how to deal with malware and\n\n134\n00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:52.690\ndeal with it effectively, especially\nto break it apart and analyze it.\n\n135\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.769\nBecause you really have to understand not\njust the general concepts of malware,\n\n136\n00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.711\nyou have to understand all these other\nthings we've been talking about in all\n\n137\n00:05:58.711 --> 00:05:59.635\nthese other episodes.\n\n138\n00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:03.716\nYou gotta understand networking, you gotta\nunderstand APIs and application calls and\n\n139\n00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:06.650\nessentially be a developer to\nunderstand how to read the code.\n\n140\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.292\nYou've gotta understand what the code can\ndo and then understand what it is doing.\n\n141\n00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:14.083\nSo you've gotta be expert\nat system process and\n\n142\n00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:17.700\nunderstanding memory allocations and\nmemory mapping.\n\n143\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.270\nYou've got to understand the way that\nsystems are operating and what they're\n\n144\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.410\nbeing asked to do and what the evidence\nis of that and how that is showing up.\n\n145\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.485\nAnd all this kind of stuff in order to\nreally understand and analyze malware.\n\n146\n00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.175\nIt's incredibly complicated stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:30.785\nI don't know.\n\n148\n00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:33.010\nI know you've spent a lot of time\ndoing the front-end side of stuff.\n\n149\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like the hacking in.\n\n150\n00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:35.305\nI don't know if you ever do.\n\n151\n00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:35.905\nHave you done any work?\n\n152\n00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.358\nHave you actually written out and\ncreated malware of a more complex nature?\n\n153\n00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:42.157\nYou're not facing exploited scripts,\nbut this is really complicated stuff.\n\n154\n00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:47.870\n&gt;&gt; I mean, and we say malware,\nbasic malware, easy virus type of things.\n\n155\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.920\nYeah but nothing crazy.\n\n156\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.456\n&gt;&gt; Like virus kit 101.\n\n157\n00:06:49.456 --> 00:06:53.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, virus kit 101 stuff,\nnot the cool polymorphic.\n\n158\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.805\nOr even stuff that I usually use\nbuilders or whatever stuff that kind of,\n\n159\n00:06:57.805 --> 00:06:59.915\nyou just tell it what you want it to do\nand it kinda builds the code for you.\n\n160\n00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:02.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the point and click type\nof environments that are modulars.\n\n161\n00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:02.935\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:05.375\n&gt;&gt; Essentially like Lego blocks,\nwhen you're writing code.\n\n163\n00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:06.559\n&gt;&gt; Why reinvent the wheel?\n\n164\n00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.526\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] that's the way, that's\nthe training wheels right, right there.\n\n165\n00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:10.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's how you start out.\n\n166\n00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:14.984\nBut I mean you go from that, I mean people\nthat are writing this incredibly deep,\n\n167\n00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:17.187\ndark, scary malware that you hear about,\n\n168\n00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.572\nsometimes being used in the cyber\nwars that are raging right now.\n\n169\n00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:24.076\nThis kinda stuff,\nthe Nimdas, the code reds.\n\n170\n00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:28.586\nThe flames, the ducos right of the world,\nthese worms,\n\n171\n00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:31.406\nthese viruses,\nthese trojans that are being thrown\n\n172\n00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:34.966\nacross the world by government\nentities as opposed to individuals.\n\n173\n00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:36.500\nWriting that kind of code,\n\n174\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.343\nis way beyond where most security\nprofessionals wind up being.\n\n175\n00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:42.443\nBut you could see evidence of\nthe fact that this is done and\n\n176\n00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:43.543\ndone on a regular basis.\n\n177\n00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:46.493\nA lot of the crypto ware and\nransom ware that's out there now that's\n\n178\n00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:48.910\nmaking its way, WannaCry,\nand these variants.\n\n179\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.865\nWe think and have evidence to show,\n\n180\n00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:54.783\nis probably coming from state back\nstate sponsored entities, right.\n\n181\n00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:58.343\nWhether it's the North Korean,\nthe Chinese, the Russians, who knows,\n\n182\n00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:02.029\nwe're not saying, it's any all of them,\nwe don't know authoritatively.\n\n183\n00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:05.445\nBut we have indicators of the fact\nthat they may be Coming from one or\n\n184\n00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:06.669\nmore of those parties.\n\n185\n00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:11.040\nThese are people that are highly trained,\nhighly skilled in what they do.\n\n186\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.890\nAnd are not to be taken lightly.\n\n187\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.634\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz people that have these kind\n\n188\n00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:16.940\nof skills have skills\nto do a lot of damage.\n\n189\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.287\nAnd we really as investigators have\nto respect that, step back and\n\n190\n00:08:20.287 --> 00:08:24.233\nunderstand that and approach it from\nthe perspective of the fact that we really\n\n191\n00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:28.537\nhave to understand that what we're seeing,\nwhat we're using, what we're doing,\n\n192\n00:08:28.537 --> 00:08:31.157\ncan do us a great deal of\nharm if we're not careful.\n\n193\n00:08:31.157 --> 00:08:33.109\nIt's the equivalent of\nthe Bio 4 containment\n\n194\n00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n195\n00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.596\n&gt;&gt; Levels that we have to operate\nwith around some of the most nastiest\n\n196\n00:08:36.596 --> 00:08:37.710\ndiseases around.\n\n197\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.850\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat some types of malware.\n\n198\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.520\nWhat they, talk a bit about them.\n\n199\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.131\nSo here we have lists of all sorts\nof different kinds of malware and\n\n200\n00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:45.470\neverybody has their favorites.\n\n201\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.140\nWhat's your favorite piece of malware?\n\n202\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.400\n&gt;&gt; My favorite piece of malware,\n\n203\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:48.973\nthe nasty-\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n204\n00:08:48.973 --> 00:08:49.663\ncategory-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n205\n00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:50.984\ncategory of malware is ransomware.\n\n206\n00:08:50.984 --> 00:08:52.850\nMan that stuff or cryptoware-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n207\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.990\n&gt;&gt; These things are crazy stupid and\n\n208\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.850\nman you get bit by one of these things and\nyou never forget it.\n\n209\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.390\n&gt;&gt; So okay I like those, I actually from\nthe perspective of doing the pen testing\n\n210\n00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.720\nportion where I'm thinking\nokay I wanna send stuff in,\n\n211\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.090\nI wanna see what I can find in or\nI wanna distract.\n\n212\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.110\nAnd confuse.\n\n213\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.960\nI'm thinking things like\nmaybe spam sending malware.\n\n214\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.590\nI'm gonna overload a system for DDOS.\n\n215\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.100\nThat may be good.\n\n216\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.740\nI'm certainly thinking scareware if I can\nget people to trick them into clicking\n\n217\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.150\non something or there was this thing\na few years back, what was it the share?\n\n218\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.810\nIt was when Shareware was big.\n\n219\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.365\nIt was like the J Bear scare thing.\n\n220\n00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:31.170\n&gt;&gt; I vaguely remember this yes.\n\n221\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Where there was a file\nactually in a Windows stack.\n\n222\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.350\nThis is back in like I think Windows\n2000 maybe 2003, something like that.\n\n223\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.680\nWhere in the stack there were a couple\nfiles that had this really bizarre weird\n\n224\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.050\nliterally something bear\ndot something name.\n\n225\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.301\nAnd everybody thought okay\nthere's no way that's real, and\n\n226\n00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:52.304\nso there was a thing going around saying\nyou have to delete this, it's a virus.\n\n227\n00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:53.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's malware and\n\n228\n00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.226\npeople were deleting this and\n\n229\n00:09:55.226 --> 00:09:58.630\nblowing their servers up because\nthey were actually legitimate files.\n\n230\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.410\nAnd so you gotta be careful\nwith that kind of stuff but\n\n231\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.470\nthose kind of things I think\nare sometimes underrated.\n\n232\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.130\n&gt;&gt; I would agree yeah.\n\n233\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they can do a lot of damage, and\n\n234\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.260\nfrom my perspective, my mindset when I'm\noffensively trying to get into systems.\n\n235\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.198\nI'm targeting the average\ninformation worker-\n\n236\n00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.189\n&gt;&gt; Right the human aspect.\n\n237\n00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:18.270\n&gt;&gt; That just doesn't know.\n\n238\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.860\nAnd I'm gonna go after that\nlowest common denominator,\n\n239\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.290\nthe weakest link in the chain.\n\n240\n00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.050\nBecause I'm gonna be\neffective if I can just get\n\n241\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.530\na couple of those people to do something.\n\n242\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.790\nAnd chances are good, we all know that\nthey're probably gonna be the weakest link\n\n243\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.920\nin any execution chain cuz they have\nthe least amount of training, and\n\n244\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.760\nprobably the least involvement in day\nto day activities around this, so\n\n245\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.335\nthey just don't really know that they're\ndoing something that is unfortunately\n\n246\n00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:43.400\ngonna lead to exploitation.\n\n247\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.950\nAnd so it's the lowest hanging fruit.\n\n248\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.020\nRight, stuff like ransomware\nyeah I agree with you,\n\n249\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.980\nthe crypto-lockers,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n250\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.720\nReally nasty stuff but you know, if\nyou're smart about what you do with your\n\n251\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.290\ninformation safeguards, you're smart about\nbacking up, while it's a major pain,\n\n252\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.280\ndon't get me wrong, it's inconvenient.\n\n253\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You know.\n\n254\n00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:00.285\nThe reality is you should be able to\n\n255\n00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:04.305\nrestore that system and simply wipe\nout all traces of the cryptoware.\n\n256\n00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:05.472\nYeah, you may lose a little bit of\n\n257\n00:11:05.472 --> 00:11:06.236\ndata based on-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:08.165\n&gt;&gt; When you backed up versus\nwhen you were infected.\n\n259\n00:11:08.165 --> 00:11:12.215\nBut the reality is, you should have the\nability to be able to recover from that\n\n260\n00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:13.405\nin relatively short order.\n\n261\n00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:15.725\nI mean, if you're doing what you're\nsupposed to do all the time.\n\n262\n00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:20.705\nYou're doing the basic blocking and\ntackling of network 101 admin and\n\n263\n00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:21.585\nsecurity 101 admin.\n\n264\n00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:24.020\nYou should have backups of this stuff and\n\n265\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.190\nyou shouldn't have to\nworry that much about it.\n\n266\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.370\nIt is inconvenient, I don't-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n267\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Disagree, but you know it should\nnot cause us this much concern.\n\n268\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.190\nI think the deadliest thing on\nthe list for me, would be a root kit.\n\n269\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n270\n00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:36.468\n&gt;&gt; I mean just you know.\n\n271\n00:11:36.468 --> 00:11:38.341\nBased on what we've\nalready talked about it,\n\n272\n00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.069\nsome of the things we\nknow root kits can do,\n\n273\n00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:43.402\nbecause that's something that again in\ntheory we should be able to recover from.\n\n274\n00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:46.004\nYou have a baseline image,\nand you backup your data.\n\n275\n00:11:46.004 --> 00:11:49.552\nYou should be able to isolate that\ninstance, blow it up, turn it off, and\n\n276\n00:11:49.552 --> 00:11:51.459\nwhatever you need to do to get rid of it.\n\n277\n00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:54.724\nAnd simply re-image and\nthen bring back down the data.\n\n278\n00:11:54.724 --> 00:11:58.937\nThe problem is of course if a root kit has\nbeen integrated into the imaging process,\n\n279\n00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:01.612\nnow you're talking about\nSony level destruction.\n\n280\n00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:04.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; As opposed to anything else.\n\n281\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.540\nI saw that, I didn't see the show.\n\n282\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.400\nBut I don't watch this show.\n\n283\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.838\nAngie Tribeca?\n\n284\n00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:09.555\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n285\n00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:10.191\nHaven't seen it.\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those new comedies\n\n286\n00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:10.714\nthat's out there any way.\n\n287\n00:12:10.714 --> 00:12:13.687\nYeah but one of the clips on\nTV I saw was something about,\n\n288\n00:12:13.687 --> 00:12:15.889\nmy God it was Chipotle level destruction.\n\n289\n00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:17.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so not quite that.\n\n290\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.890\nBut it was Sony level destruction.\n\n291\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.170\nWhat I mean by that is if you've kept up\nwith your stories over the last few years,\n\n292\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.350\nSony has had more than their fair share\nof oops moments with regards to managing\n\n293\n00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.700\nmalware and rootkits, some self-inflicted,\nsome inflicted on them by others.\n\n294\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.770\nBut when you are not paying\nattention to the details,\n\n295\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.440\nyou're not managing supply chain risk,\nthese things happen.\n\n296\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.360\nAnd that's one of those underrated areas,\n\n297\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.120\nby the way, that we often don't talk about\nwith regards to investigative process,\n\n298\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.720\ncertainly, in the broader\nworld of security and hacking.\n\n299\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.260\nBut you know today, more and more,\nsupply chains are becoming extended.\n\n300\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.700\nWe are outsourcing more and more of the\ncapabilities and therefore the resourcing\n\n301\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.820\naround providing capabilities, and\nwe have to manage that risk, and\n\n302\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.710\nif we're not paying attention to\nthat as investigators, that more and\n\n303\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.530\nmore we are seeing has become\nthe avenue in the approach.\n\n304\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.330\nThe vector that bad actors are using to\ninfiltrate and if we're not examining\n\n305\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.860\nthe supply chain we may be missing\nsome very important information\n\n306\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.770\nabout where these attacks are coming from\nand as a result why they are successful.\n\n307\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.413\nAnd depending on industry obviously maybe\nmore or less impactful you know your\n\n308\n00:13:18.413 --> 00:13:21.730\nsupply chain may not be that extended,\nmay not be that involved.\n\n309\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.520\nBut depending on what you do,\nit may be very extended.\n\n310\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.400\nIt may be worldwide and\nbring multiple avenues of opportunity for\n\n311\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.500\nbad actors to infiltrate\nthat supply chain.\n\n312\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.360\nSo just think about that.\n\n313\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.610\nBut let's walk though\na common list of malware.\n\n314\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.350\nThings like backdoor programs.\n\n315\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.620\nThey open up typically remote access,\nso we call them RATs.\n\n316\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.560\nA lot of the time you hear me refer to\nthem that way in many of our discussions.\n\n317\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.020\nRemote Access Trojan, RATs,\nthey're considered backdoor malware items.\n\n318\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.790\nThey open up what we call covert\nchannels for us to be able to\n\n319\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.565\nsend information back and communicate\nwith some sort of either bot herder,\n\n320\n00:13:54.565 --> 00:13:59.405\nsomebody controlling a group of machines\nthat have been zombied or botted, and or\n\n321\n00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:04.095\nperhaps just calling home, phoning home to\nsome sort of standalone, standoff server,\n\n322\n00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:07.465\nwhere things like keyloggers may be\nuploading their files every so often.\n\n323\n00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:09.900\nThe backdoors can be used for that.\n\n324\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.955\nRoot kits, we mentioned those,\nthose are nasty.\n\n325\n00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:17.055\nThey're gonna burrow deep into the core,\nthe kernel of most OSs operate below\n\n326\n00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:20.775\nthe radar, stealth themselves from the GUI\nfrom a lot of tools that are designed to\n\n327\n00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:25.980\nfind them and we are then typically gonna\nsee exploitation code being launched\n\n328\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.530\nto secondary infection through root kits,\ncertainly the ability to operate at that\n\n329\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.270\nlevel of full access to the OS implies\nprivilege escalation among other things,\n\n330\n00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.820\nso there's a lot of things that can go\nwrong there, bot nets as just mentioned\n\n331\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.220\nwill be on this list, multiple machines\nthat have been either backdoored or\n\n332\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.540\nrooted or both will then be used\nin some sort of orchestrated or\n\n333\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.330\ncoordinated way by one or\nmore nefarious individuals, right?\n\n334\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.044\nThe Svengalis\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:14:53.044 --> 00:14:53.604\n&gt;&gt; That are pulling\n\n336\n00:14:53.604 --> 00:14:55.210\nthe strings behind the scenes, right?\n\n337\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.820\nAnd so they are going to awake\nthese machines up at some point and\n\n338\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.470\nsay okay, tap, tap, tap,\neverybody pay attention.\n\n339\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.080\nLet's go over there, let's attack that\nsystem, I need 1,000 of you lined up.\n\n340\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.850\nIt's almost like Despicable Me\nwith the Minions.\n\n341\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Right okay,\n\n342\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.780\nwe're all gonna line up to go over here\nand so you know we're gonna have that.\n\n343\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.712\nThat's what botnets are.\n\n344\n00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:14.320\nThey are machines that have been\ninfected with some sort of command and\n\n345\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.820\ncontrol software that allows somebody or\na group of somebodies to control them.\n\n346\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.610\nAnd out on the dark web, you could rent\nthese botnets by the hour or by the day.\n\n347\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:24.564\nBot net for day.\n\n348\n00:15:24.564 --> 00:15:25.399\n&gt;&gt; That is crazy.\n\n349\n00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.419\n&gt;&gt; I need a bot net and\n\n350\n00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:30.410\n1,000 machines wanna go beat\nup on some network over there.\n\n351\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.117\nYeah, for $100 you ask what ever it is I\ndon't know what the going rate would be\n\n352\n00:15:34.117 --> 00:15:36.100\nright now but we can bring the ticker up.\n\n353\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.633\nThere's an app we should create-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n354\n00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:39.749\n&gt;&gt; What's the going rate for\nbot nets on the dark web?\n\n355\n00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:43.588\n&gt;&gt; Would it be illegal for\nus to advertise the services of a bot net?\n\n356\n00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:44.891\n[LAUGH] I don't think so.\n\n357\n00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:46.166\n&gt;&gt; It's a gray area,\n\n358\n00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:48.724\nbecause we're not actually,\n&gt;&gt; Right-\n\n359\n00:15:48.724 --> 00:15:49.346\n&gt;&gt; Employing them, we're just telling you.\n\n360\n00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:51.787\n&gt;&gt; We're not using them,\nwe're simply telling you where to go.\n\n361\n00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:54.744\n&gt;&gt; You could go there and get in,\nif you break the law, that's up to you.\n\n362\n00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:55.244\n&gt;&gt; In theory we've heard that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:15:55.244 --> 00:15:56.867\n&gt;&gt; There may be opportunity on that.\n\n364\n00:15:56.867 --> 00:15:57.564\n&gt;&gt; But you're never\n\n365\n00:15:57.564 --> 00:16:00.264\ngonna see prices this low again.\n[LAUGH] End of month,\n\n366\n00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:01.302\njust for you,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:16:01.302 --> 00:16:01.918\n&gt;&gt; Close out special.\n\n368\n00:16:01.918 --> 00:16:02.606\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n369\n00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:03.924\n&gt;&gt; We've been going out of business for\n\n370\n00:16:03.924 --> 00:16:06.123\n10 years now here at crazy Rick's\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I'm going out.\n\n371\n00:16:06.123 --> 00:16:07.250\n[LAUGH] Crazy Rick's botnets.\n\n372\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.380\n&gt;&gt; Crazy Rick's botnets [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.810\nThere you go exactly, right?\n\n374\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.898\nSo when we think about that, right you\nknow I mean it's ridiculously ludicrous\n\n375\n00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:18.420\nas we were just joking around about, but\nyou know this is actually serious stuff.\n\n376\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.600\nYou can go out and there are entire areas\nof the dark web where you can trade\n\n377\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.370\nin these activities, you know.\n\n378\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.920\nSilk Road was a website that got\nshut down several years back,\n\n379\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.640\nyou may remember hearing about that.\n\n380\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.290\nYou may have known about it\nwhen it was running, who knows?\n\n381\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.610\nBut there were all sorts of stuff\nbeing traded there, weapons,\n\n382\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.030\ndrugs, I mean you name it.\n\n383\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.530\nJust all sorts of stuff that clearly was\ninappropriate, but you were also able to\n\n384\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.480\nbuy and access malware and botnets through\nthat site among all the other things.\n\n385\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.350\nIt was like a one stop shop.\n\n386\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.290\n&gt;&gt; For bad guys.\n\n387\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.490\n&gt;&gt; For bad guys yeah.\n\n388\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.500\nWe do all your outfitting.\n\n389\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.950\nTailoring while you wait for\nyour bad guy costume right?\n\n390\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.370\nAll right so we have Scareware that\nwould on the list as well I mentioned\n\n391\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.110\nsome of that kind of stuff.\n\n392\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.820\nWe call them commonly hoaxes,\nthat's a category you often hear.\n\n393\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.280\nYou know we try to trick\nyou into doing something.\n\n394\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.840\nDon't click that button,\ncuz you know what happens when you do.\n\n395\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.510\nThose kind of hoaxes that\nwill get you to do things.\n\n396\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.040\nDownloaders, sometimes you will see right?\n\n397\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.950\nAnd these often show up or form,\nthey will take the form of,\n\n398\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.800\nhey let's go to CNET for instance.\n\n399\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.360\nNot that the CNET side is bad But\nCNET to get a lot of software.\n\n400\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.420\nYou guys may be familiar with that,\n\n401\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.870\nI don't know if you ever\ngo out to that site.\n\n402\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Be that you go out and\n\n403\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.410\nyou download stuff from there all\nthe time right CNET to come downloads.\n\n404\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.940\nAnd if you go there you a lot of times you\nget the adware, the stupid advertising.\n\n405\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.310\nInstead of downloading with the link\nthat's the little unobvious link where\n\n406\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.120\nyou're supposed to go.\n\n407\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.530\nThey've got the big\n&gt;&gt; Download yeah.\n\n408\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.590\n&gt;&gt; Download here button right?\n\n409\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo you click there and you want up\ngetting the stupid download prompt for\n\n410\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.920\nsome sort of you know Garbage\nwhere they want you to install.\n\n411\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.290\nYou know those kinds of\nthings can be downloaded.\n\n412\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.810\nSo I'm not again suggesting\nthat CNET has malware.\n\n413\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.270\nI'm just pointing out that,\nthat could easily\n\n414\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.495\ntranslate into a site that may not be\nreputable involve the opportunity to\n\n415\n00:17:57.495 --> 00:18:00.705\ndeploy malware through that download\nlink that you click on by mistake.\n\n416\n00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.465\nThat's how a lot of trojans show\nup in your systems where you\n\n417\n00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:05.045\ndownload something you don't realize.\n\n418\n00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:08.775\nAnd all of a sudden you've got that\nhidden buffer iFrame thing going on.\n\n419\n00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:10.430\nThere's something running\nbehind the scenes.\n\n420\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.320\nThis is why you need real\ntime malware software,\n\n421\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.010\nanti malware software running, right?\n\n422\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.590\nBecause you have to have to have the\ncapability to see those invisible windows,\n\n423\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.340\nspotting those iFrames being loaded, those\nprograms executive so you can block them,\n\n424\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.930\nbecause this is how a lot of that now\nwhere it gets into your system, right.\n\n425\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.070\nSo we have things like that.\n\n426\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.600\nWe have launchers fall into\nthe same kinda category.\n\n427\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.480\nWorms or viruses, worms and or\nviruses, take your pick, one or both.\n\n428\n00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.500\nCertainly, probably the oldest forms\nof malware that we see historically\n\n429\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.510\nhave been around for\n\n430\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.010\nalmost as long as computer have been\naround for, since the 1980s certainly.\n\n431\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.930\nMacros viruses and worms from\nthe oldest viruses and worms we see.\n\n432\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.540\nDo you know what the key to finding\na difference would be between\n\n433\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.190\nthe worm and the virus?\n\n434\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.270\nWe talk about this all the time.\n\n435\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.020\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I do.\nThe difference between a virus and\n\n436\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.890\na worm is that a worm does not require\nuser interactions to propagate itself.\n\n437\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.140\nIt actually has built-in mechanisms so it\ncan spread itself throughout the system.\n\n438\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.830\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to a virus-\n&gt;&gt; Which needs you to click on something\n\n439\n00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.450\nand install this and then email it to your\nfriends and then they do the same thing.\n\n440\n00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Share the love, yes, share the love.\n\n441\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.772\nPass the virus\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n442\n00:19:17.772 --> 00:19:18.984\n&gt;&gt; You remember Pass the Dutchie?\n\n443\n00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:19.914\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n444\n00:19:19.914 --> 00:19:21.794\n[MUSIC]\n\n445\n00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:23.614\n&gt;&gt; Pass the virus on the left hand side,\n\n446\n00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:26.491\nthere you go right with the USB\nstick because that is a lot of\n\n447\n00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:29.810\ntimes ridiculously enough how\nthis kind of stuff propagates.\n\n448\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.750\nCertainly it propagates an email we know,\nwe've all heard the stories about\n\n449\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:37.260\nattachments being sent, you have\nmacro viruses, I think I may have,\n\n450\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.430\nnot in this group of shows but certainly\nand I think some of the others talked\n\n451\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.230\nabout the fact that you know Microsoft let\ntheir guard down a couple of years ago and\n\n452\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.590\nactually started to turn off macro virus\nsecurity settings in Office by default,\n\n453\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.230\nbecause there had been no\nevidence of this for a long time.\n\n454\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.300\nAnd then of course,\nwhat do bad actors out there do?\n\n455\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.080\nThey're paying attention.\n\n456\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.760\nSay, well look,\nthey stopped defending against it.\n\n457\n00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.270\nProbably a good time to start\nlaunching macro viruses again, right?\n\n458\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.360\n&gt;&gt; Did you notice they took the gate down,\nmoved all the guards away?\n\n459\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we may wanna go over there.\n\n460\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.580\nWe should try going that way.\n\n461\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.630\n&gt;&gt; See what's going on, right?\n\n462\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.560\nSo what do they do?\n\n463\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.510\nThey dust off all the old macro viruses\nand they start cranking them out again.\n\n464\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.220\nAnd then we get slammed with this as,\nnot zero day exploits, but\n\n465\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.280\ncertainly advanced persistent\nthreat kind of activities, and\n\n466\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.218\nthen Microsoft had to go out and\nactually start reactivating.\n\n467\n00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:24.420\nThat's security setting, and\nthose settings because they turn them\n\n468\n00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.880\noff by default and\nmany people had left them off.\n\n469\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.411\nYou know this just a simple classic\ncase of somebody thinking they are doing\n\n470\n00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:31.307\nthe right thing and\n\n471\n00:20:31.307 --> 00:20:34.574\nmake the decision that sounds like\nit makes a lot of sense at the time.\n\n472\n00:20:34.574 --> 00:20:38.424\nThere's been no activity for x number of\nyears why are we continuing to do this,\n\n473\n00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:42.333\nwell there's a very good reason because\nfirewalls and bulwarks are important or\n\n474\n00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.015\nthe bad things come back, right?\n\n475\n00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:46.303\nYou see the movie The Chinese Wall?\n\n476\n00:20:46.303 --> 00:20:47.076\n&gt;&gt; I have not seen that.\n\n477\n00:20:47.076 --> 00:20:49.282\n&gt;&gt; The one with Matt Damon,\nthe one with the Great Wall?\n\n478\n00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:53.060\nChina's Wall the great wall, you know what\nthey're fighting on the other side there.\n\n479\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.230\nThat's like the macro virus right there.\n\n480\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n481\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.033\n&gt;&gt; The movie generated\n&gt;&gt; I have to check that out.\n\n482\n00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:58.830\n&gt;&gt; The dragon beast.\n\n483\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was actually a good movie.\n\n484\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.450\nAll right, so and then things like\ncredential stealing programs, right?\n\n485\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.785\nEssentially we're just\nharvesting credentials, right?\n\n486\n00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:08.485\nWe may be using key loggers may fall\ninto this category for instance.\n\n487\n00:21:08.485 --> 00:21:12.675\nThey will often be doing that again,\npass the key logger, pass the virus.\n\n488\n00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.415\nWe just have different\ncategories on the thumb drive.\n\n489\n00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:17.105\nIt would great if you could\nput this in to get a menu.\n\n490\n00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:18.845\nWhat infection would you like today\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n491\n00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:19.635\n&gt;&gt; And it lets you choose.\n\n492\n00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:21.845\nCuz that would be the democratic\nway of doing that right?\n\n493\n00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:23.985\nGive out the malware,\nwe'll let people choose what they want.\n\n494\n00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:28.030\nSo here's one you may not have heard of\nthat actually is making the rounds and\n\n495\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.660\nis actually becoming more of a problem.\n\n496\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.060\nWe've probably, most of you out there\nhave done this at some point, I'm sure.\n\n497\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.170\nI certainly have seen people\ndo this all the time.\n\n498\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.340\nYou're traveling and\n\n499\n00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.290\nespecially if you're in an airports,\nyou've got to plug you're phone in.\n\n500\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.240\nSo a lot of time you go find a wall but\nthen the two or\n\n501\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.000\nthree smart people who figure out\nhad to camp out in front of it.\n\n502\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.930\nTake it and you're done.\n\n503\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.180\nSo now they have all\nthese charging stations.\n\n504\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.660\nYou see this in airports all the time.\n\n505\n00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.740\nWhere you can just go plug in and\nthere's ten USB ports.\n\n506\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.000\nYou plug your phone in.\n\n507\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.240\nSame thing on airplanes almost every\nseatback today if they have the video\n\n508\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.830\ndisplays, a lot of than then will\nstart having the power port so\n\n509\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.430\nthat you can plug,\nwhich is fine except for one thing,\n\n510\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.651\nwhat if there is malware lurking in\nthose ports that you're not aware of?\n\n511\n00:22:04.651 --> 00:22:08.370\nIs there a hardware based malware that\ncan be propagated through hardware?\n\n512\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.490\nYeah, there is, absolutely, I'm not\nsuggesting it's common but is it uncommon?\n\n513\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.910\nNo it's not uncommon,\nit's not just very common yet.\n\n514\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.840\nCould somebody have rig those\ncharging ports by monkeying around\n\n515\n00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.420\nwith the firmware and loaded now where\nin there that would then pass through\n\n516\n00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.900\nthe hardware into your\ndevice when you plug in?\n\n517\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.790\nYeah, they could.\n\n518\n00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.900\nIt's not unheard off.\n\n519\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.375\nAnd then are you propagating that\nmalware now wherever where you go.\n\n520\n00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:31.990\nYou very well, could be.\n\n521\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.230\nSo, next time you go plug that device in,\nthink about the fact that you that you\n\n522\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.080\ndon't know where that device is plugging\ninto, in the sense you know your device,\n\n523\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.140\nyou know where its been.\n\n524\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.640\nBut what about what's on\nthe other side of that plug?\n\n525\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.540\nHow do you know what's going on there,\nright?\n\n526\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.700\nI mean, you just don't know.\n\n527\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like when you\ngo to the gas station, right?\n\n528\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.780\nAnd you put your card in a little slot-\n&gt;&gt; Got to pull on the card reader-\n\n529\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.890\n&gt;&gt; You better mess around and\n\n530\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.140\nfiddle with that thing first.\n\n531\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.070\nI know that's real something like I'm\nnot gonna do that, what's the odds?\n\n532\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:00.540\nAsk the people that had identity theft or\ntheir bank accounts emptied.\n\n533\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.060\n&gt;&gt; The odds, they are good.\n\n534\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.300\n&gt;&gt; And they're getting better.\n\n535\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.450\n&gt;&gt; And they're getting better by the day.\n\n536\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.605\nThe odds are you'll listen.\n\n537\n00:23:07.605 --> 00:23:09.015\nIt's not just even gas stations.\n\n538\n00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:11.785\nThey've got video footage, some of\nthese attacks if you go back and look.\n\n539\n00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:16.625\nThey've had a rash of attacks in Home\nDepot and Target in many of these areas.\n\n540\n00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:19.865\nBut they've actually got overhead camera\nfootage in the stores of these guys\n\n541\n00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:23.805\nputting in the fake readers\nover the credit card machines\n\n542\n00:23:23.805 --> 00:23:28.345\nin the self checkout lanes in Home Depots\nand some of these other stores.\n\n543\n00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:32.390\nAnd you go, you watch this stuff\nafter the fact the guy comes and\n\n544\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.550\npulls it out of the bag.\n\n545\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.890\nThey've already got it figured out so\nthey know what model's there.\n\n546\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.440\nIt's designed to look identical.\n\n547\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.220\nIt fits right over the actual unit.\n\n548\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.680\nThey're not unplugging it for\nanything else.\n\n549\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.630\nThey're just putting a sleeve,\nessentially, over the original unit.\n\n550\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.620\nSo it doesn't set off any alarm bells and\nwhistles.\n\n551\n00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.260\nIt's not working,\nit's unplugged or whatever.\n\n552\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.030\nThey just put it in so that when you slide\nyour card in either on the bottom chip or\n\n553\n00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.330\nyou swipe, either way,\nthe reader is not being engaged.\n\n554\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.190\nIt's the actual reader,\nyou're getting the reader that is the fake\n\n555\n00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.980\none that's recording the data\nto an SD card or whatever.\n\n556\n00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.150\nThen they'll come back a couple hours\nlater, they'll either grab the unit or\n\n557\n00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.260\nthey'll just take the SD card out and\nwalk away.\n\n558\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.650\nThey've got everybody that scans through\nthat terminal actually there, I mean,\n\n559\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.480\njust crazy,\ncrazy stuff when you think about it.\n\n560\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's amazing.\n\n561\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.070\nI always say check those pads,\njust pull on them,\n\n562\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.010\nwiggle them, see if they move at all.\n\n563\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.336\n&gt;&gt; And if they come out in your hand,\nby that way, that's a bad sign.\n\n564\n00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a bad thing, yeah.\n\n565\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.590\n&gt;&gt; Immediately go tell somebody.\n\n566\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.060\n&gt;&gt;

watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:13.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.459\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:20.534\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well, you know what,\n\n7\n00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:22.617\nwe're back with more on our CHFI series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:24.047\nJoining me in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:28.608\nsome people know him as MC Phillips Head\nScrewdriver, you know him as Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:30.091\nAdam, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.402\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is going well, it is going\nwell, that's what I'm supposed to talk\n\n12\n00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:37.103\nabout, is 80s music references, offline\nbefore we get back on with the episode.\n\n13\n00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.030\nSo hopefully, it is going well with all\nof you, we're gonna continue with part 2.\n\n14\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.529\nAs in better than part 1, but\nnot quite there for part 3,\n\n15\n00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.880\nwhich will be coming up after\nwe're done with part 2.\n\n16\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.733\nBut part 3, in this case, is actually\ngonna be a little hands on walk through,\n\n17\n00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.542\na demonstration as they say, of some\nmalware analysis techniques and tools.\n\n18\n00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:56.000\nIt will be very interesting, definitely\nwanna come back and take a look at that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.380\nBut before we get there, basic components\nof most malware programs, what are they,\n\n20\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.350\nyou may ask.\n\n21\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.720\nWell, I'm glad you did ask that\nquestion because I have a list for you.\n\n22\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.760\nLet's take a look.\n\n23\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.920\nSo what are the basic components\nof most malware programs?\n\n24\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.190\nCan we go full screen on\nthat if you would please?\n\n25\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.393\n&gt;&gt; There they are.\n&gt;&gt; There they are right there.\n\n26\n00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:11.088\n&gt;&gt; In their glory.\n\n27\n00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:11.998\n&gt;&gt; In their glory,\n\n28\n00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:15.840\nall eight of them, all little sneaky\ndevils that we've identified.\n\n29\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690\nSo let's talk about what these things are.\n\n30\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.610\nYou heard me mention a few of these,\ndownloaders, droppers,\n\n31\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.330\nthings like that, injectors.\n\n32\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.170\nWe're talking about the concepts, but\n\n33\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.752\nyou may not always familiarize yourself\nwith them by formally defining them.\n\n34\n00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:32.960\nAnd if we're planning on preparing for,\nI don't know, perhaps an exam or two.\n\n35\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.890\n&gt;&gt; A survey, it's not a test,\nit's a survey.\n\n36\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.552\n&gt;&gt; A survey of knowledge, right, we\nwould want to know these definitions and\n\n37\n00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:42.517\ncertainly in the real\nworld as investigators.\n\n38\n00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:46.887\nWe have to know what we are looking at\nas we begin to break apart malware and\n\n39\n00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:47.683\nanalyze it.\n\n40\n00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:48.332\nSo that way,\n\n41\n00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:52.090\nwe have a better sense of the kind of\nthings that we may need to address.\n\n42\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.630\nAnd so we have crypters,\ndownloaders, droppers,\n\n43\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.610\nexploits, injectors, obfuscators,\npackers, and payloads.\n\n44\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.417\nThe crypter is the program itself that\nconceals the existence of the malware.\n\n45\n00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:06.620\nWe use this software to avoid\ndetection by anti-virus,\n\n46\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.090\nanti-malware systems as you see.\n\n47\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.820\nWe encrypt the malicious\nfile to avoid detection.\n\n48\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.620\nRemember, anything that's encrypted,\nwe have two options, right,\n\n49\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.830\neither we can decrypt it,\nexamine it, and see what's in there.\n\n50\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.920\nOr if we're not given that right or\nopportunity because we don't have access\n\n51\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.985\nto the decryption function, typically,\nthe key that is required to do that.\n\n52\n00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.405\nWe give you then try to hack a way at it,\n\n53\n00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.975\nbrute force it, guess it,\ntry to break it open.\n\n54\n00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:34.205\nBut if we can't do that, we gotta choose,\neither we allow the traffic, or\n\n55\n00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:37.105\nthe item, or whatever it is to execute,\nmove through the system,\n\n56\n00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.585\nwhatever the case may be, unchallenged.\n\n57\n00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:43.705\nNot knowing what's inside the black box,\nor we deny access.\n\n58\n00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:47.280\nWe do not allow it to run, we don't\nallow the traffic to be propagated.\n\n59\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.780\nWe throw it away, in other words,\nbecause we can't tell what it is.\n\n60\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.060\nAnd those are really the only\ntwo choices we have.\n\n61\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.830\nEither we can decrypt,\nbut if there's no way for\n\n62\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.980\nus to do that, we have to decide,\ndo we trust the software?\n\n63\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.541\nOr do we not?\n\n64\n00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.960\nAnd if we don't,\nwe should not allow it to run.\n\n65\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.100\nSo we just wanna keep that in mind.\n\n66\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.340\nBut that's what the whole\nconcept of the crypter is.\n\n67\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.090\nIt is that wrapper, that program,\ntraditionally, that is used to actually\n\n68\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.000\nhide, essentially,\nmalware components by encrypting them,\n\n69\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.280\npreventing them from being scanned or\nanalyzed.\n\n70\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.740\nSome systems will not\nallow them to be found and\n\n71\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.580\nused because we say essentially and\nthen we can't examine will not be allowed.\n\n72\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.821\nMany email systems, in other words,\nwill vet system attachments this way and\n\n73\n00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.340\nremove emails that cannot be opened and\nread.\n\n74\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.840\nBecause we don't have\nthe inline decryption keys.\n\n75\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.454\nWe'll simply drop them as spam, malware,\nwhatever you wanna call them, and\n\n76\n00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:37.660\nfilter them out.\n\n77\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.230\nBut some may allow them through, right?\n\n78\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.180\nWhat's good for everybody may\nnot always be applied equally.\n\n79\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.950\nDownloaders, we have them up there.\n\n80\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.130\nType of Trojan that, as we talked about,\nwill download different kinds\n\n81\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.340\nof malware and, or other malicious code\nthat is brought in on to the machine.\n\n82\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.310\nSo they will go out and grab a hold\nof those files from some sort of\n\n83\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.300\nrepository out there in the cloud,\non the web, wherever.\n\n84\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.000\nAnd once they're on the machine and\n\n85\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.040\nthey have been launched through\nsome sort of installation, or\n\n86\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.760\npiece of software, they will then quietly,\nin the background, start downloading.\n\n87\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.780\nIf you've ever had Windows Updates for\ninstance, right,\n\n88\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.650\ndownloaded behind the scenes while\nyou're waiting on something,\n\n89\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.030\nespecially if you use Windows 10.\n\n90\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.907\nThings like that today they download all\nthe time without even being aware of them.\n\n91\n00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:21.733\nAnd then all of a sudden, you get a prompt\nto restart because those downloads have\n\n92\n00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.420\nbeen activated, and\nthey have been applied.\n\n93\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.530\nThe downloader works like that, right?\n\n94\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.379\nAny of these program are just behind the\nscenes or running without our knowledge,\n\n95\n00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.484\nApple, for instance,\nruns the Apple, what is it?\n\n96\n00:04:34.484 --> 00:04:36.945\nThe list center or\nwhatever they call it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:39.659\nTheir little software update program for\niTunes, things like that,\n\n98\n00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.143\nthe iTunes Helper, I think they call it or\nsomething like that,\n\n99\n00:04:42.143 --> 00:04:44.449\nwhere it's running and\nit's just listening all the time.\n\n100\n00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.393\nAnd you're like, once it calls home,\nright, to Apple and says, hey,\n\n101\n00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:48.230\nare there updates?\n\n102\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.724\nAnd every so often, you see you get that\npop-up on the screen with the Apple update\n\n103\n00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:57.373\nindicator, saying hey, there's a new\nversion of iTunes and iCloud and whatever.\n\n104\n00:04:57.373 --> 00:04:59.334\nAnd you have to download it,\nthe same thing with Adobe,\n\n105\n00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:01.524\nmany of these programs run these\nservices in the background.\n\n106\n00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:05.008\nThat's what a downloader essentially is,\nbut think about one that is designed\n\n107\n00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:07.610\nspecifically to download and\npull in updates for malware.\n\n108\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.340\nCuz that's what we're doing.\n\n109\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.860\nRight, we have a dropper, this typically\nis going to be, as you can see there,\n\n110\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.130\ncan contain, I should say, unidentifiable\nmalware code that the scanners,\n\n111\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.920\nthe AV scanners may not be able to detect.\n\n112\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.660\nBut they're also capable of\ndownloading additional files needed\n\n113\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.280\nto execute malware on the system.\n\n114\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.803\nSo the dropper itself may be a form\nof a file that is a wrapper,\n\n115\n00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:35.645\nit essentially covers and\nenvelops malware code.\n\n116\n00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:39.680\nBut we may also be able to download\nadditional malware on demand.\n\n117\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.982\nSo a dropper is almost like a combination\nof a crypter and a downloader,\n\n118\n00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:44.310\nif you wanna think about it.\n\n119\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.328\nBecause it will envelop the malware code,\nperhaps making it unrecognizable for\n\n120\n00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:53.026\nthe AV software,\nthe defensive software we're running.\n\n121\n00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.445\nBut also has the download\ncapabilities go out and\n\n122\n00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:59.300\ngrab additional updates as required,\nright, and so, that's kinda nice.\n\n123\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.180\nWell, not nice for\n\n124\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.110\nus when we get infected, but nice for\nthe bad actors that have that capability.\n\n125\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.110\nExploits, one or more code the attackers\nuse to breach a system's security\n\n126\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.910\nthrough one or more vulnerabilities.\n\n127\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.190\nSo exploit or exploits are the things\nthat we often are fighting against.\n\n128\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.580\nThese are the actionable\nitems that weaknesses or\n\n129\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.470\nvulnerabilities are going\nto be turned into.\n\n130\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.655\nInjectors are programs that, as the name\nimplies, puts some sort of export and\n\n131\n00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:25.409\nmalicious code into the system.\n\n132\n00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.607\nRunning them allows us to\nthen take over the system,\n\n133\n00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:33.202\nwe talked about injection attacks and\nall sorts of things that go on there.\n\n134\n00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:36.152\nObfuscators, programs that can seal or\nattempt to hide,\n\n135\n00:06:36.152 --> 00:06:40.018\nmuch like a crypter would, the code of\nthe malware via various techniques.\n\n136\n00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:44.167\nBut specifically not just encryption,\nwhen you do just encryption,\n\n137\n00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:48.440\nyou are considered a crypter when\nyou are doing other techniques.\n\n138\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.050\nPolymorphic techniques, where we mask and\nmorph every time, where we\n\n139\n00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.810\nare transposing, where we're substituting,\nwhere we're changing the names of files.\n\n140\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.280\nThere's a bunch of stuff\nobfuscators will do.\n\n141\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.568\nThat general class of activity\nis referred to as obfuscators.\n\n142\n00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.340\nBut a specific, very,\nvery uniquely defined and\n\n143\n00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.870\nnarrowly tailored example of using\nencryption specifically to do this,\n\n144\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.890\nis carved out and called the crypter,\njust to make that clear.\n\n145\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.097\nPackers, pieces of software that\ncompress malicious malware or software,\n\n146\n00:07:17.097 --> 00:07:20.087\nconvert the code into some\nsort of unreadable format.\n\n147\n00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:24.885\nSo again, we're trying to sneak by the\nscanning engine of some kind, whatever it\n\n148\n00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:30.010\nmay be, trying to hide that code, and\nsomehow prevent people from seeing it.\n\n149\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.093\nAnd then payload's part of the malware\nthat performs the desired activity when\n\n150\n00:07:33.093 --> 00:07:33.606\nactivated.\n\n151\n00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:37.090\nWhatever that is, that is gonna\nbe the stuff that is going to,\n\n152\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.168\nfrom the bad actor's perspective,\n\n153\n00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:43.523\nyou'll really be the piece of the puzzle\nthat allows them to take control, or\n\n154\n00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:47.696\nto break in and get the file, or\nwhatever they're looking to do, right?\n\n155\n00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:51.611\nThe payload is the injection of the bad\ncode that we are using and the outcome\n\n156\n00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.674\nof that, that's the pay load that we\nare gonna go after, that kind of thing.\n\n157\n00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:57.160\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n158\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.095\nAnd when we talk about all these different\ncomponents we have to analyze malware to\n\n159\n00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:01.672\nfind them.\n\n160\n00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:05.224\nNow we have two types of techniques\nthat we use for malware analysis,\n\n161\n00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:07.560\ntwo traditional ones, there are variants.\n\n162\n00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.730\nBut traditionally we think\nof static analysis and\n\n163\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.150\nwe also think about Dynamic\nanalysis of malware code.\n\n164\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.383\nStatic analysis implies that we're looking\nat the code, breaking it down looking at\n\n165\n00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:23.617\nliterally code review line by line, we're\ngoing through without executing the code\n\n166\n00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:26.992\nwhich is the key to finding difference\nbetween the two approaches.\n\n167\n00:08:26.992 --> 00:08:30.759\nSo we're reading the code offline,\nwe may use a decompiler or\n\n168\n00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:35.265\ntext editor to break open and examine\nthe executable or the code package.\n\n169\n00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:40.564\nTrying to decompress decompile and\nto deconstruct the code looking at it and\n\n170\n00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:43.462\nthen when we are dynamically examining or\n\n171\n00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:48.295\nexecuting it inside of some sort\nof sandbox or isolated system.\n\n172\n00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.227\nTo see what the outcome of\nthat particular code may be so\n\n173\n00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:54.992\nstatic versus dynamic are the two\ndifferent kinds of malware analysis\n\n174\n00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:59.034\ntechniques that we engage in,\nwanna make sure we're familiar with that.\n\n175\n00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:01.058\nSometimes static analysis and\n\n176\n00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:06.045\nbehavioral analysis will be added along\nwith dynamic analysis to that mix.\n\n177\n00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:10.251\nYou hear behavioral and dynamic analysis\noften referred to in the same breath,\n\n178\n00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:13.352\nin the sense they both kinda\nrefer to the same idea.\n\n179\n00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:17.042\nSo static analysis, you'll executing,\nor excuse me, examining the code,\n\n180\n00:09:17.042 --> 00:09:21.282\nnot executing it, dynamic analysis,\noccasionally called behavioral analysis,\n\n181\n00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:23.340\nbut more often are called\ndynamic analysis.\n\n182\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.200\nExecuting the code usually in the virtual\nmachines we've talked about sandboxing it\n\n183\n00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.230\nand then examining and seeing what\nwill come out of that as a result.\n\n184\n00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.304\nWe may look at in static analysis things\nsuch as file fingerprinting, you know\n\n185\n00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:38.640\nwhat's the tell tale sign, the hash the\ncode, the digital signature of the file.\n\n186\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.364\nDoes that match known vectors,\nknown engines,\n\n187\n00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:46.092\nthat are used to propagate malware local\nwhere online malware scanning can be done?\n\n188\n00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:49.140\nYeah, well, I'm gonna do a demo here for\nyou and take a look at.\n\n189\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.844\nAnd given the time we're running,\nwe actually probably incorporate our\n\n190\n00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:57.040\npart three back into your part two and we\nwill always get optimized here on ITProTV.\n\n191\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.896\nIt's group on Thursday here on ITProTV.\n\n192\n00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:02.317\nWe're gonna give you two episodes for\nthe price of one.\n\n193\n00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:04.678\nWe're actually gonna write down this demo,\nand\n\n194\n00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:06.644\nactually do the the hands on piece live.\n\n195\n00:10:06.644 --> 00:10:09.347\nI'll do it for you and\nnow part of the actual discussion in and\n\n196\n00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:11.510\njust not pumped it off to a third episode.\n\n197\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.173\nSo that way we can incorporate\neverything at one time.\n\n198\n00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:16.235\nBut we'll take a look at online malware\nscanning, I'm actually gonna show you how\n\n199\n00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:18.560\nto use a site called Virus Total,\nyou may have seen that.\n\n200\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.097\nWe'll take a look at that among others.\n\n201\n00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:23.674\nWe can do string searching, I'll show you\nlittle bit about a tool called Strings we\n\n202\n00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:25.680\ncan use to actually do\nsome string searching.\n\n203\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.210\nLooking for strings or snippets of code\nthat may actually prove to be valuable.\n\n204\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.040\nWe could do identifying and look at\noficification methods and packing so\n\n205\n00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.090\nwe break apart the executable\nlooking at the core components.\n\n206\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.727\nWe may do a dependency cross walk on\nthe actual core code itself and the DLLs.\n\n207\n00:10:41.727 --> 00:10:43.984\nI'm gonna show you that with\na tool called dependency walker.\n\n208\n00:10:43.984 --> 00:10:47.074\nAnd show you that we see some\ntelltale evidence of a virus or\n\n209\n00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:50.166\nmalware in the code,we could\nsee something like a mem copy\n\n210\n00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:52.965\ncommand which really should\nnot normally be there.\n\n211\n00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:57.260\nThat's a telltale sign that we probably\nhave viruses or malware inside that code.\n\n212\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.470\nCuz why would you copy\nthe contents of memory and\n\n213\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.090\nthen try to output it somewhere else\nwhen you're executing the code?\n\n214\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.140\nThat normally is not done unless\nwe're doing something where we're\n\n215\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.790\ntrying to steal information or\nperhaps move it some place.\n\n216\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.110\nAnd so that's a telltale sign and\nwe'll look for that.\n\n217\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.530\nSo we'll take a look at some these.\n\n218\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.512\nSo why don't do the following?\n\n219\n00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:14.450\nGive me just half a second really quickly.\n\n220\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.608\nNow before we go the machine,\nI'm just gonna minimize this and\n\n221\n00:11:16.608 --> 00:11:18.331\nbring up the VM that we're\ngonna demonstrate on.\n\n222\n00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:19.940\nJust give me one second.\n\n223\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.088\nAnd let me just bring up\nthe site that we need here and\n\n224\n00:11:24.088 --> 00:11:27.090\nI need one other piece of the puzzle.\n\n225\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.178\nSo let me have that up.\n\n226\n00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:32.226\nAnd just one other one that we need.\n\n227\n00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.340\nThat's the one I just wanna\nget out of right there.\n\n228\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.240\nAll right, so\nlet me bring this up here and yeah.\n\n229\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.370\nGo ahead and bring this up.\n\n230\n00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.830\nI was just getting the right\nVM loaded because I have\n\n231\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.670\ntwo different VMs to demo on and\ntwo different things we're gonna do.\n\n232\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.210\nSo in here on this VM,\nyou can see we're running this here.\n\n233\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.422\nLet's go full screen if we could just so\n\n234\n00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:50.019\nwe can see everything\nthat's a little bit bigger.\n\n235\n00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:53.423\nSo what we're gonna do is take a look\nat the virustotal website that I\n\n236\n00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:54.660\nmentioned online.\n\n237\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.262\nThis is an online submission\nengine where we can go in and\n\n238\n00:11:58.262 --> 00:12:00.111\ncan actually take a look at.\n\n239\n00:12:00.111 --> 00:12:05.840\nAnd better understand, [COUGH] What\npotentially is making up an executable.\n\n240\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.949\nMaybe something we think may or\nmay not have a virus associated with it.\n\n241\n00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:12.040\nAnd so, what I've done is\njust gone to virustotal.com.\n\n242\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.430\nAnd I'll come out here to the new tab and\nwe'll just go ahead and\n\n243\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.300\nwe'll bring up the main sites you could\nsee what it looks like for a minute.\n\n244\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.030\nSo I already set up the demo rights\nsubmitted the executable file takes a long\n\n245\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.510\ntime to do the analysis depending\non the size of the file.\n\n246\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.910\nSo I just preloaded it so\nwe could look at the results so\n\n247\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.050\nI don't wanna mess with that page\ncuz then we'll have to do it again.\n\n248\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.419\nBut this is what the VirusTotal\nwebsite looks like.\n\n249\n00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.097\nAnd so, you could see, they just\nhave a little submission area here.\n\n250\n00:12:36.097 --> 00:12:37.960\nChoose your files, go to path through.\n\n251\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.098\nSo, if we find a potential unknown,\nor perhaps mystery executable,\n\n252\n00:12:42.098 --> 00:12:45.956\nduring an investigative process,\nif we don't have the skills,\n\n253\n00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:50.727\nthe skill sets, the ability in house to be\nable to do a thorough tear down analysis\n\n254\n00:12:50.727 --> 00:12:55.039\non the malware we may use one of these\nonline sites in instance to do that.\n\n255\n00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:56.360\nSo we would Would submit this.\n\n256\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.370\nNow, to be clear and to be fair, the virus\nvendors are running sites like these cuz\n\n257\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.750\nthey wanna get the submissions, right?\n\n258\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.957\nIt makes sense for them.\n\n259\n00:13:02.957 --> 00:13:04.824\nLet's pull stuff in from the wild.\n\n260\n00:13:04.824 --> 00:13:06.330\nLet's see what out there.\n\n261\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.810\nWe'll do the heavy lift for\nyou is what they're saying.\n\n262\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.402\nWe'll break it down to the analysis.\n\n263\n00:13:10.402 --> 00:13:13.231\nTell you whether we think it's nowhere or\nnot and\n\n264\n00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:17.371\nthen we get the benefit as the the V\nvendors have seen the latest stuff and\n\n265\n00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:20.890\nthen we can build our catalogs\nmake our definitions better,\n\n266\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.185\nmake our products better so we're\nhelping you cos you're helping us so.\n\n267\n00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:27.037\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole community thing.\n\n268\n00:13:27.037 --> 00:13:30.981\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely so just so you're clear so\nyou're comfortable with the idea that you\n\n269\n00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:34.236\nknow that this is being run by one\nof more of the big AV houses right?\n\n270\n00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:38.629\nThe Kaspersky's and\nthose kinda companies like the Symantec-\n\n271\n00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:40.832\n&gt;&gt; Symantec, McAfee.\n\n272\n00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:44.433\n&gt;&gt; They all have their own versions of\nthese sites and you pick and choose,\n\n273\n00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:46.485\nI don't care what you do it's up to you.\n\n274\n00:13:46.485 --> 00:13:49.038\nYou may like virus total you may use\nanother one I use a whole bunch of\n\n275\n00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:51.143\ndifferent ones depends on\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n276\n00:13:51.143 --> 00:13:54.156\nBut the idea is that they are you gotta\njust make sure they're reputable right you\n\n277\n00:13:54.156 --> 00:13:56.296\ngot to make sure you go onto\nthe ones that are legitimate.\n\n278\n00:13:56.296 --> 00:14:00.900\nBut you could submit the files,\nyou could just go ahead you can see here.\n\n279\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.317\nJust path to it up to a maximum of\n128 megs in the case of virustotal.\n\n280\n00:14:05.317 --> 00:14:10.370\nEvery one of these has their own different\nkinda limitations associated with it.\n\n281\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.550\nSo you just wanna understand\nthat the site may or\n\n282\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:18.370\nmay not have a hey, let's only submit\na file up to a certain size kinda limit\n\n283\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.350\nbecause they may not want you to\nsubmit these massively large files.\n\n284\n00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.429\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n285\n00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:26.259\nBut you go to the VirusTotal\nsite you submit it.\n\n286\n00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.980\nSo, let's say I've done\nthat already which I have.\n\n287\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.299\nJust hit scan it down there.\n\n288\n00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.320\nCome back over here.\n\n289\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.350\nAnd when you do that what you find is,\nit gives you a little prompt.\n\n290\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.270\nAnd says hey if it's seen the virus file\nbefore, or the potential malware before.\n\n291\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.534\nIt'll say hey this looks familiar.\n\n292\n00:14:44.534 --> 00:14:47.610\nSomebody scanned this already\nwhich may very well be.\n\n293\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.270\nAn indication that you're onto something.\n\n294\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.601\nIf it's a brand new file nobody's ever\nscanned before, that doesn't mean it\n\n295\n00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:55.850\ndoesn't act as a malware,\nit just means that maybe zero the exploit.\n\n296\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.697\nBut if you put up a piece of malware that\nthousands of people have scanned already,\n\n297\n00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:01.393\nthere's gonna be a record of that.\n\n298\n00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:05.480\nSo it may come up and prompt you and say,\nhey, by the way, we've seen this before.\n\n299\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.590\nLast time we saw it was six months ago,\nor I don't know, whenever it was.\n\n300\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.330\nDo you wanna see the results of that\nlast scam, or do you wanna rescam this?\n\n301\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.500\nSo you get a prompt.\n\n302\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.660\nIt's up to you decide.\n\n303\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.818\nSo I just went ahead and\nclicked, yeah, rescan right?\n\n304\n00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:18.880\nIf I get that prompt,\nthat's what I will typically do.\n\n305\n00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.140\nAnd then it runs through,\ngives you a shy 256 hash string for\n\n306\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.790\nthe file, tells you the name for the file.\n\n307\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.080\nI actually did the actual\nkeylogger.exe file.\n\n308\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.403\nIt's one of the hacking tools we\nuse in the CEH episodes where we\n\n309\n00:15:31.403 --> 00:15:32.602\nshow you keyloggers.\n\n310\n00:15:32.602 --> 00:15:34.440\nI just grabbed that file,\n\n311\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.630\na legitimate piece of software\nthat we use for keylogging.\n\n312\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.373\nIt is a keylogger, but\nI just submitted it, no big deal.\n\n313\n00:15:43.373 --> 00:15:47.733\nWent ahead and did the analysis earlier\ntoday, so I had it set up and ran it, and\n\n314\n00:15:47.733 --> 00:15:50.920\nthen once you do that,\nyou get the analysis output here.\n\n315\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.810\nI'm just switching the tabs here for\na minute.\n\n316\n00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.230\nYou get the analysis out.\n\n317\n00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.378\nBut I like this site, by the way,\n\n318\n00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:57.400\ncuz they have a little graphic\nwith the devil or the angel.\n\n319\n00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.179\nYou can see the arrows up in the middle\nand what the arrow indicates is,\n\n320\n00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:04.880\nclick if you think it's malicious or\nclick if you think it's not.\n\n321\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.400\nWe're kind of in the middle right now,\nwe haven't voted.\n\n322\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.150\nAlbeit this way, you can just have\na little fun, thumbs up, thumbs down,\n\n323\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.150\nthat kind of thing.\n\n324\n00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:17.840\nSo you'll see here that\nthe antivirus vendors, Avast, AVG,\n\n325\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.800\nClam Av, Scion etcetera they are finding\nthat this may actually be malware.\n\n326\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.639\nAnd they're noting in here the different\nvariants of malware that could be included\n\n327\n00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.949\nwith the anti key logger or\nkey logger software whatever I've scanned.\n\n328\n00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:34.480\nAnd they're telling us what is and\nso I'm seeing lists.\n\n329\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.420\nKaspersky sees this as not a virus\nheuristic Win32 generic monitor.\n\n330\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.302\nMcAfee sees it is Artemis.\n\n331\n00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:47.930\nAnd the McAfee GW edition says it behaves\nlike Win32 PUP vc or whatever you know.\n\n332\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.050\nSo there's all these different references.\n\n333\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.401\nHard to say for sure what it is or is not.\n\n334\n00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:56.157\nBut it does have a pedigree that seems\nindicate there may be malware somewhere\n\n335\n00:16:56.157 --> 00:16:58.510\nburied in this file, hard to say for sure.\n\n336\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.360\nNot knowing but this is the kind\nof thing we'd start going through.\n\n337\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.940\nSo now we could look at the file detail.\n\n338\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.900\nIt breaks it down for us,\nactual key logger, what file version,\n\n339\n00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.550\nwhat descriptor.\n\n340\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.730\nLooks like if there's any comments it will\ntell us that, what has been found here.\n\n341\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.510\nWhat are the individual PE sections or\n\n342\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.060\nthe code sections broken out their\naddress, their size, the raw size.\n\n343\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.120\nAnd the MD5 hash that's\nassociated with them.\n\n344\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.310\nAre there any DLLs, the PE imports\nwe'll see them there, resources.\n\n345\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.370\nI'll show you some other tools\nthat break these down even more.\n\n346\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.490\nBut we begin to see that\nthere's actual content here and\n\n347\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.290\nthere may be stuff that\ncould be valuable to us.\n\n348\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:43.240\nWe're dissecting this executable you\nwould need a program that opens up\n\n349\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.910\nthe executable, rips open the wrapper.\n\n350\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.750\nThe obfuscation program around it, and\nthen allows us to see the individual dll\n\n351\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.440\nfiles, text files, all the stuff that's\ninside that makes up the executable.\n\n352\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.250\nWe don't often stop and\n\n353\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.400\nthink about the fact that when we double\nclick on a file we're executing software.\n\n354\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.800\nThat software's made up of\na lot of different components.\n\n355\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.138\nAnd we have to understand what's in those\ncomponents to really do the virus analysis\n\n356\n00:18:05.138 --> 00:18:07.230\nAnd that's what we're looking at here.\n\n357\n00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.859\nSo we can see all of this, just kinda\nscroll back up, we can see that.\n\n358\n00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:14.519\nWe can look at any additional\ninformation that may be there,\n\n359\n00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:16.474\nit varies by program of course.\n\n360\n00:18:16.474 --> 00:18:21.500\nBut we can see,\nwe may see some additional information.\n\n361\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.450\nWe may get some additional things,\nhard to say what they are.\n\n362\n00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.530\nWe'll get File size, File type,\n\n363\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.170\nit's a 32-bit executable,\ntells us some interesting stuff.\n\n364\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.130\nIt's a Windows based program.\n\n365\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.430\nIt's on the Windows platform.\n\n366\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.950\nSo, there definitely are some\nthings that can be valuable here.\n\n367\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.150\nSo, we will see some information and\nwe can begin to pick apart just the very,\n\n368\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.810\nvery beginning phases of this.\n\n369\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.910\nBut we got to go deeper, right?\n\n370\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:43.710\nSo we gotta do more.\n\n371\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.480\nSo we've done that, that's online.\n\n372\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.560\nThat's static analysis for\nus since we're not communicating directly,\n\n373\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.600\nwe're asking the virus vendor to\ndo an analysis and show it to us.\n\n374\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.690\nThis is one example of one way\nwe may be able to do this.\n\n375\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.130\nNow, let me switch over to another machine\n\n376\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.270\ncuz I have a different VN\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n377\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.807\nWe'll come back to this tool in just\na minute this is a dependency walker tool\n\n378\n00:19:05.807 --> 00:19:08.615\nthat let's us look at file\ndependency in a piece of malware.\n\n379\n00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.464\nBut let's do a couple\nof other things here.\n\n380\n00:19:11.464 --> 00:19:15.293\nLet's take a look at the malware.\n\n381\n00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:19.010\nAnd let's say same idea right\nwe're just going to use a program.\n\n382\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.478\nI use another file this one called it's\njust another program I have laying around.\n\n383\n00:19:23.478 --> 00:19:27.140\nAnd I walked it through\na tool called strings.\n\n384\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.630\nAnd what strings allows me to do is to\nbreak apart the executable, look inside,\n\n385\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:36.865\nand search for all the different strings\nthat are found inside of the package.\n\n386\n00:19:36.865 --> 00:19:38.595\nAnd I just use the command to output this.\n\n387\n00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:42.885\nI did, whatever the package name is that I\nwanna examine, output it to a text file.\n\n388\n00:19:42.885 --> 00:19:46.485\nBecause you can see there's so much stuff\nin the string buffer that comes out,\n\n389\n00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:49.075\nthat it's so much it overflows\nthe buffer in the command shell.\n\n390\n00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:53.455\nI can't see it all, so I went ahead and\njust outputted that to a text file.\n\n391\n00:19:53.455 --> 00:19:57.632\nSo I can go in and\nwe can go here to the C drive.\n\n392\n00:19:57.632 --> 00:20:00.974\nAnd you see right there\nI have strings.txt.\n\n393\n00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:05.392\nSo I can just bring that up, and\nI have this is a sysinternal tools string,\n\n394\n00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:09.260\nthis is one of the tools we can\ndownload from the Microsoft site.\n\n395\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.900\nRemember, I showed this to you,\nwe went at it, we did auto runs,\n\n396\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.418\ngot it from Tech Net from the site.\n\n397\n00:20:14.418 --> 00:20:16.560\nIt's just one of tools.\n\n398\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.650\nFreely available,\neasy to get a hold of, easy to use.\n\n399\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.050\nAnd so we just run that and\nit deconstruct force and\n\n400\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.270\nshows us all the string fragments.\n\n401\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.940\nNow, what strings are gonna tell us,\nit's hard to say,\n\n402\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.260\nit depends on what's in there.\n\n403\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.160\nBut we may find string fragments that\nindicate that there maybe a console\n\n404\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.480\nin the program, maybe it's running,\nmaybe it's hidden.\n\n405\n00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.930\nMaybe there is a string fragment that\nindicates that there's virus activity\n\n406\n00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.845\ncuz we see words that may\nbe associated with viruses.\n\n407\n00:20:40.845 --> 00:20:42.580\nThis all these different\nthings we may see.\n\n408\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.970\nIt's hard to say for sure, but\nas we start to break this apart and\n\n409\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.470\nexamine it,\nthere's quite a bit of stuff in here.\n\n410\n00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.400\nA lot of it is just garbage that probably\nmakes absolutely no sense to us, but\n\n411\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.210\nwe do get some bigger ones as we go down.\n\n412\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.640\nAnd again I know streaming\nthrough here real quickly.\n\n413\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.020\nSeemingly randomly, it's very hard\nto tell if any of this is valuable.\n\n414\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.320\nWe would go in and\nwe would execute a string filter.\n\n415\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.210\nWe'd probably do a search here and\nstart to look for certain things.\n\n416\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.030\nI don't know if maybe this is valuable or\nnot.\n\n417\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.710\nThis particular string, it stands\nout as being bigger than the others.\n\n418\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.350\nSo typically longer strings\nmay indicate certain things.\n\n419\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.380\nSo maybe we would search for all\nstrings with certain character size and\n\n420\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.730\nthen wanna see what's in there.\n\n421\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.230\nMaybe a certain actual character itself,\n\n422\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.220\nmaybe we're looking for the word malware,\nnot that it will be that obvious.\n\n423\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna see malware,\n\n424\n00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.702\nthat would be pretty obvious.\n\n425\n00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:32.671\n&gt;&gt; But you could see things\nlike IP addresses sometimes\n\n426\n00:21:32.671 --> 00:21:33.198\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:21:33.198 --> 00:21:35.513\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of stuff, right?\n\n428\n00:21:35.513 --> 00:21:36.567\n&gt;&gt; URLs, things of that nature.\n\n429\n00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:37.497\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n430\n00:21:37.497 --> 00:21:41.670\nAnd you never know what that\ncould lead you to believe.\n\n431\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.579\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely so this is another static\nI'm just scrolling down you kinda see.\n\n432\n00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:47.313\nThis is another static\nbreakdown as you can see here,\n\n433\n00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:50.515\nwe got some bigger stuff here\nright that we're seeing.\n\n434\n00:21:50.515 --> 00:21:54.485\nThere's some CStatic, CButton,\nCList, CCombo, CEdit.\n\n435\n00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:57.195\nSo there's obviously some things\nthat are going on here so\n\n436\n00:21:57.195 --> 00:22:00.995\nwe may be able to tell a little bit\nmore about this as we go, right?\n\n437\n00:22:00.995 --> 00:22:02.565\nCFileDialog or maybe some stuff.\n\n438\n00:22:02.565 --> 00:22:05.085\nThere's a DLL reference right there.\n\n439\n00:22:05.085 --> 00:22:09.715\nMaybe we see some DLL files and\nthose files indicate traces of potential\n\n440\n00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:13.445\nmalware activity cuz they're known\nassociates of certain types an hour.\n\n441\n00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:16.541\nAnd by pulling those strings out we say,\naha!\n\n442\n00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.420\nThat one right there,\nthat is that's that classic aha moment-\n\n443\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.018\n&gt;&gt; Smoking gun, yeah.\n\n444\n00:22:21.018 --> 00:22:22.103\n&gt;&gt; That aha moment you hear about.\n\n445\n00:22:22.103 --> 00:22:25.637\nThat file, that dll may be\nthe telltale sign that we have now.\n\n446\n00:22:25.637 --> 00:22:28.121\nIt's not in this case, but I'm just\npointing out, could be, it's hard to say,\n\n447\n00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:28.910\nyou don't know.\n\n448\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.050\nSo, string analysis, again static.\n\n449\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.640\nWe are not executing the malware.\n\n450\n00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.570\nWe're simply looking at\nthe output from one or\n\n451\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.592\nmore tools,\nlooking to see what's going on in there.\n\n452\n00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:41.070\nWhat about a tool like this?\n\n453\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.596\nLet's say we go in here,\nwe execute this tool right here.\n\n454\n00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:48.580\nPE View, the name of the tool,\nyou could see it right here.\n\n455\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.060\nPE View allows us to go in,\nto the assembly programs,\n\n456\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.060\nit allows to look at the code.\n\n457\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.660\nAnd we open up and then find under\nthe executable a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n458\n00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.750\nWe can go into look at the signature.\n\n459\n00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.880\nWe can go in to look at the file header.\n\n460\n00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.445\nTell us how big this information is.\n\n461\n00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:11.485\nOr how big the program is,\n\n462\n00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:16.375\nwe're starting to look at data, maybe some\nof it is in hex, others may or may not be.\n\n463\n00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.165\nWe could look at the image header,\n\n464\n00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:21.115\nsee a lot of information in\nhere that may be valuable.\n\n465\n00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:26.055\nMajor OS, minor OS versions,\nthe Win32 version value, so\n\n466\n00:23:26.055 --> 00:23:27.695\nwe know whether it runs in Windows or not.\n\n467\n00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:30.795\nWe get a bunch of tables here,\nthe export-import table.\n\n468\n00:23:30.795 --> 00:23:31.905\nI know it's hard to see, I'm covering.\n\n469\n00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:33.220\nCould we go full screen,\nthank you very much.\n\n470\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.420\nJust scroll over so you can see that.\n\n471\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.870\nYeah, we've got the different tables and\nthe values associated with it.\n\n472\n00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.200\nCertificates, we've got\nthe DEBUG Directory.\n\n473\n00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.770\nWe've got GLOBAL POINTER Register.\n\n474\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.185\nWe've got the LOAD CONFIG Table,\nthe IMPORT Address Table.\n\n475\n00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:52.511\nThere's a lot of stuff in here that\nwould allow us to start delving in and\n\n476\n00:23:52.511 --> 00:23:56.850\nfinding more data as we continue to\ngo in and look deeper in the program.\n\n477\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.636\nSo we've got a lot of valuable stuff\nthere, we've got the text information,\n\n478\n00:24:01.636 --> 00:24:06.129\nwhich we kinda saw up there, the size\nof the raw data, by the way here, and\n\n479\n00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:08.400\nif I can highlight the virtual size.\n\n480\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.410\nThese two,\nif these two are going to be the same,\n\n481\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.640\nand they should be the same size overall,\n\n482\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.450\nwe would obviously have to translate\nthis information to find out the size.\n\n483\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.540\nBut the size should be the same, the size\nis different if the virtual size is\n\n484\n00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.660\ndifferent from the raw file size,\nthat may indicate malware.\n\n485\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.058\nRight, so we would have to be looking at\nthis stuff and start to really delve in,\n\n486\n00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:30.697\nand again this is all static,\nwe're not executing the code,\n\n487\n00:24:30.697 --> 00:24:32.920\nwe're just looking at information here,\nright.\n\n488\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.700\nWe see the R data, the size of the raw\ndata right here specifically is what we\n\n489\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.148\nwould look at, virtual size right, we'd be\nlooking at that stuff as I was suggesting.\n\n490\n00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:43.615\nHere's information, okay, just again,\n\n491\n00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:46.823\njust going through looking\nat various aspects, right.\n\n492\n00:24:46.823 --> 00:24:51.321\nSo we could begin to unravel what may be\nin here, here's the actual raw data and\n\n493\n00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:52.562\nthe values, right.\n\n494\n00:24:52.562 --> 00:24:55.133\nThe hex value in the code for\nthis information,\n\n495\n00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:59.190\nthat's all the raw data inside of here,\nthat's the text, rather.\n\n496\n00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.080\nHere is the data and\nthe raw data that is being seen,\n\n497\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.310\nand we would begin to\nexamine all this delving in.\n\n498\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.150\nLooking for more information, again\nstatic analysis using yet another tool.\n\n499\n00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.620\nFrom here we would go over to\na tool like Dependency Walker,\n\n500\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.580\nyou could see this tool right here,\nAbout Dependency Walker, right,\n\n501\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.700\nso yet another tool we may\noften find in the toolkit.\n\n502\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.440\nLooking at static analysis\nmethodologies around viruses or\n\n503\n00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.750\naround malware, support proposed malware I\nshould say, right, we don't know for sure.\n\n504\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.780\nBut I've loaded this file, then again,\nit opens up, the Dependency Walker\n\n505\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.100\ntakes apart the executable, loads all\nthe DLLs, which is what you're looking at\n\n506\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.570\nright here, and shows me the DLLs and\nthe connections between them.\n\n507\n00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.760\nSo I'm seeing a hierarchy of how\nthe code is put together here,\n\n508\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.980\nand when I come in under, in this case,\n\n509\n00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.680\none of DLLs near the top of the stack,\nI mentioned a couple of minutes ago.\n\n510\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.170\nMay be we see a mem copy function, right,\n\n511\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.380\nwhy would see mem copy function\nin the DLL traditionally?\n\n512\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.550\nWell there may be reasons, but one of the\nprimary drivers may be that we're actually\n\n513\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.460\nculling and pulling content out of memory,\n\n514\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.440\nand perhaps we're trying to examine\nthat when we're not supposed to.\n\n515\n00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.140\nThat is typically telltale evidence of\nthe fact that there may be malware or\n\n516\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.030\nvirus running inside\nthis package somewhere.\n\n517\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.510\nAnd that right there would be possible,\nand we could see down below,\n\n518\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.700\nwe have a memcpy, memory space, or\nreallocation of here, and entry point\n\n519\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.660\nthat shows us that it's executing in\na certain sequence inside the software.\n\n520\n00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.510\nAnd that it may be called to do\nsomething at a certain point.\n\n521\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.850\nWe could see how all these files\nare gonna be linked together.\n\n522\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.180\nThis is the methodology,\n\n523\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.540\nthis is the tool set, these are the things\nthat we would engage in doing if\n\n524\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.750\nwe are engaging in static analysis of some\nsort of virus, or some sort of malware.\n\n525\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.480\nAnd there's just a lot of tools\nthat do these kinds of things, but\n\n526\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.980\nI'm showing you samples of\nthe ones that are very common.\n\n527\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.940\nDynamic Behavioral analysis\nis very different,\n\n528\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.690\nwe're not gonna engage in that just to\nbe clear, because that means running\n\n529\n00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.680\nlive code in a nice laid environment and\nseeing what it does.\n\n530\n00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.740\nSo let me throw a grenade into the room,\nshut the door, wait for it to go off and\n\n531\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.720\nfind out what the result of that would be.\n\n532\n00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.400\nIs the equivalent analogy I\ncan offer you for that, but\n\n533\n00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.250\nthat would be what dynamic or\nbehavioral analysis would be.\n\n534\n00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.600\nLiterally, I would take this,\nwhat I think may be malware and\n\n535\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.888\nI would infect a system, isolating it.\n\n536\n00:27:09.888 --> 00:27:12.757\nAnd then watching,\nmaybe running some sort of monitor, and\n\n537\n00:27:12.757 --> 00:27:15.751\nbunch of different stuff to get\noutput on it or see what it does.\n\n538\n00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:18.665\nBut I'm actually executing the code,\nnot gonna go through that process,\n\n539\n00:27:18.665 --> 00:27:19.923\nwe're not gonna do there here.\n\n540\n00:27:19.923 --> 00:27:23.357\nWe're gonna stick with static as part of\nour demonstration, but I am showing you\n\n541\n00:27:23.357 --> 00:27:26.742\nfrom an investigator perspective the\nmethodology and the tools and techniques\n\n542\n00:27:26.742 --> 00:27:30.800\nand some of the things, the tell-tale\nsigns, the gives, right, that we look for.\n\n543\n00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.260\nRight, in order to be able to\nunderstand there maybe malware there.\n\n544\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll tell you what,\n\n545\n00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.570\nI didn't know that malware analysis\nwas such an interesting field.\n\n546\n00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.950\nYou've definitely piqued my interest,\nI'm gonna have to investigate that more\n\n547\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.182\njust for my own personal-\n&gt;&gt; It is wicked cool.\n\n548\n00:27:42.182 --> 00:27:44.814\n&gt;&gt; Edification, very cool stuff,\nso check that out, but\n\n549\n00:27:44.814 --> 00:27:48.398\nnow you at least have the basic and\nthe understanding of what's going on when\n\n550\n00:27:48.398 --> 00:27:50.644\nit comes to what malware\nwe have to look out for.\n\n551\n00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:54.416\nHow it infects our machines,\nwhat it's doing in the background and\n\n552\n00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:57.985\nhow we can figure out what it is and\nget it off of those machines for\n\n553\n00:27:57.985 --> 00:27:59.850\ntheir forensic purposes.\n\n554\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.910\nAdam, thank you so much,\ngreat demonstrations, we appreciate you,\n\n555\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.240\nas always, for joining us.\n\n556\n00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.830\nWe appreciate our audiences for\njoining as always as well, but\n\n557\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.260\nit looks like it's that time for\nus to part ways.\n\n558\n00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.350\nThanks for watching everyone\nsigning off for ITPro TV,\n\n559\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.390\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n560\n00:28:14.390 -->

00:00:11.540\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.693\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode\nof your CHFI version nine series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:16.450\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.640\nToday, in this episode, we'll be taking\na look at how to investigate email crimes.\n\n7\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.054\nAnd back in studios, with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:26.680\nHow is it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Going well.\n\n10\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.950\nHopefully, going well for\nall of you out there.\n\n11\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.330\nIt is always a pleasure to be\nhere spending time with Cherokee,\n\n12\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.332\nspending time with all of you.\n\n13\n00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.910\nWe're gonna continue\ntalking about different\n\n14\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.255\nways in which we investigate crimes.\n\n15\n00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:40.430\nAs digital forensic investigators, the\ncertified hacking forensic investigators,\n\n16\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.370\nthe CHFIs, we spend a lot of time in the\nfield as we've talked about in many of our\n\n17\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.740\nprior episodes doing a variety of things.\n\n18\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.380\nWe've talked about\nthe investigative process overall.\n\n19\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.340\nWe've talked about how we can examine\nvarious aspects of the server\n\n20\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.820\narchitecture, the network at large.\n\n21\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.680\nIndividual applications or programs,\n\n22\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.410\nlike database, or wireless systems\nhow we hide data with steganography,\n\n23\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.170\nall sorts of different things that as\ninvestigators we have to be aware of.\n\n24\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.640\nOne of the most common things\nthat we do any of us, all of us,\n\n25\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.290\nevery day is to communicate\nwith each other, right?\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.430\nAnd we often we'll either send texts and\nuse mobile devices and\n\n27\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.600\nwe're gonna be talking about mobile\nforensics in some upcoming episode,\n\n28\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.030\nso some interesting things for\nyou to think about and to look at there.\n\n29\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.280\nBut we spend at least at work anyway,\n\n30\n00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.240\nquite a bit of our time\ncommunicating through email.\n\n31\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.420\nThis is probably one of the more\nstandardized thought processes we have\n\n32\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.630\ntoday in the corporate worlds.\n\n33\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.260\nProbably one of the most widely used\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.210\nsystems in terms of\ncommunication collaboration.\n\n35\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.230\nWe could think of online web based\ntools today that allow us to send and\n\n36\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.680\nreceive information, collaborate,\nthings like SharePoint or Documentum or\n\n37\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.000\nWebSphere, whatever the case may be,\nwhatever platform it is and\n\n38\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.680\nthose things are important, what we\ncall ECM, enterprise content management\n\n39\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.530\nplatforms, is where we create large\nfiling cabinets in the sky, in the cloud.\n\n40\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.510\nAnd then we access information through\nthem using a variety of applications.\n\n41\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.540\nAll of that is very important, very\nspecific to what we're talking about, and\n\n42\n00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.090\nwe have to be aware of\nthose kind of things.\n\n43\n00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.510\nWe have talked about cloud forensics,\nand how cloud forensics would become\n\n44\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.550\nan important part of what we do as well,\nand some of the things to consider there.\n\n45\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.660\nBut broadly, how we feed those systems,\nhow we put information into them,\n\n46\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.610\nhow does information wind up in\nbig filing cabinets in the sky.\n\n47\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.360\nA lot of times it may be through email.\n\n48\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.090\nWe may be sending and receiving emails\nwith attachments whether they're pictures,\n\n49\n00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.990\nwhether they're documents, spreadsheets,\nwho knows what they may be,\n\n50\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.520\nwhatever they are they,\nmay go directly into these systems.\n\n51\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.724\nToday a lot of these systems are mail\nenabled so they can receive incoming mail\n\n52\n00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:43.763\nand archive and\ncatalog it into one of these libraries,\n\n53\n00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:47.399\ndirectories, folders,\nthey call it different things penny on.\n\n54\n00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.821\nWhat vendor's product you use and\nhow it's set up,\n\n55\n00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:53.520\nbut, ultimately they are just large\nfolders where we just stick information.\n\n56\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.450\nAnd we may submit directly to them or\nindirectly, right?\n\n57\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.750\nWe may email each other.\n\n58\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.330\nI may send Cherokee and email,\nshe may send me one back, and\n\n59\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.110\nthen some of that information may\nbecome part of the permanent record,\n\n60\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.450\nthe dialog around what we're doing.\n\n61\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.250\nAnd we may, somebody may submit that up\nto a system or just keep it in the email\n\n62\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.210\nserver or locally cache copy in a PST or\nOST file an offline file or\n\n63\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.080\npersonal archive on a machine,\nmirror to some sort of larger system.\n\n64\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.900\nNow this is kind of things that as CHFI's,\nwe have to start considering,\n\n65\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.590\nhave to start thinking about,\nwhere is our data with regards to email,\n\n66\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.190\nwhere is it coming from, who sent it,\nwhy did they send it, what did they send,\n\n67\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.820\ncan we validate that that data is\nlegitimately the data we're looking at.\n\n68\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.250\nWas the data sent at a certain time?\n\n69\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.550\nFrom a certain system?\n\n70\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.110\nPerhaps, an IP address helps us to\nestablish that, a MAC address, perhaps,\n\n71\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.185\na day and time stamp, or some sort of\nlog entry in the server or perhaps\n\n72\n00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:56.355\nat a service carrier, what we would call\nan ISP, an internet service provider,\n\n73\n00:03:56.355 --> 00:04:00.495\nwhen we talked about cloud forensics,\na CSP, a cloud service provider.\n\n74\n00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:03.737\nThere’s lets of moving parts and pieces to\nthe puzzle, right, if we think about it.\n\n75\n00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:07.460\nAnd we have to start bringing\ntogether a lot of the information and\n\n76\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.065\na lot of the thought processes that we've\nspent time developing in earlier parts\n\n77\n00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:16.397\nof our course, in earlier episodes of\nshows as we laid down the foundational\n\n78\n00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:18.990\nelements of the investigative process.\n\n79\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.920\nRemember, Daniel and I spent a lot of time\ngoing through those discussions with you.\n\n80\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.830\nHopefully you've had a chance\nto watch all their materials.\n\n81\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.040\nIf you haven't, definitely a good\ntime to go back, reacquaint and\n\n82\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.710\nor acquaint yourself with some\nof those materials to help you\n\n83\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.800\nunderstand the basic methodologies,\nthat we will build on and\n\n84\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.500\ntalk about with regards\nto something like emails.\n\n85\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.070\nWe'll do a deeper dive here,\n\n86\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.750\nmobile forensics as we do that in\nupcoming shows and things of that nature.\n\n87\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.430\nSo when we think about email, and\n\n88\n00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.030\nas I sneak a peek over to Cherokee and\nlook at what's she's doing,\n\n89\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.110\nI see she's actually integrating herself\nwith the email system right now.\n\n90\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.360\nSo, she's getting into character as it\nwere cuz she's looking at her emails.\n\n91\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.722\nSo, when we think of email, right, there\nare some things we wanna think about.\n\n92\n00:04:56.722 --> 00:05:00.370\nWe wanna think about the kinds of email\nsystems that we would often use, right.\n\n93\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.261\nThere are traditionally,\na lot of us would just say, an emailing,\n\n94\n00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.472\nwe don't really stop to\nthink about what that means.\n\n95\n00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:09.587\nWell, we have a client server architecture\nfirst of all and it's CHFI's,\n\n96\n00:05:09.587 --> 00:05:14.022\nwe have to be familiar with the fact that\nthere are specific systems that do certain\n\n97\n00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.955\nkinds of things when we email.\n\n98\n00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:20.545\nThere are clients right, the end user\nwill sit on a machine much like I am or\n\n99\n00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:21.805\nCherokee is now.\n\n100\n00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:26.345\nWindows based machine,\na Macintosh machine, a Chrome OS or\n\n101\n00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:30.505\na web based some sort of Android based,\ncloud based system.\n\n102\n00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:31.635\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n103\n00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:37.060\nMobile device can fall into this category\nas well, so an Android OS, an Apple or\n\n104\n00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.460\nan iOS based device, a Blackberry if\nwe're talking about mobile devices.\n\n105\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.440\nWhatever it may be, those systems are the\nclient in the client server architecture.\n\n106\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.775\nThey have some sort of operating system\nwhich we may or may not be all that\n\n107\n00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:53.915\nconcerned with with regards email but\nwe are concerned with it tangentially.\n\n108\n00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:57.285\nWe have to know where locally cached\nemail archives will be stored and\n\n109\n00:05:57.285 --> 00:06:00.437\nthat may vary by operating system and\nby application platform.\n\n110\n00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:04.545\nSo, knowledge of that may be helpful,\nbut really it's the mail application,\n\n111\n00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:08.100\nthe email app that we are using that\nis probably in more interest to use\n\n112\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.432\nwhen we talk about something like this.\n\n113\n00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:11.842\nIs it a web based app?\n\n114\n00:06:11.842 --> 00:06:15.880\nMicrosoft's OWA, Outlook Web Access,\nor whatever we call it,\n\n115\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.630\ngiven the version of\nthe platform we may be using.\n\n116\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.800\nAre we using, Microsoft Outlook,\nis what we call a desktop or a FAT or MAPI\n\n117\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.180\nclient for two different ways, installed\nas an application on a local desktop.\n\n118\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.690\nThat, these days,\ncould be on a Microsoft platform.\n\n119\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.670\nYou could have Office for\n\n120\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.340\nthe Mac and maybe using it on\na Macintosh platform today.\n\n121\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.290\nWe may have a lot of different things,\nhello, how are you, nice to see you.\n\n122\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.350\nWe have a lot of different\nthings that are going on, right?\n\n123\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.394\nSo Cherokee, I know you want to ask\nquestions, so what do you throw out?\n\n124\n00:06:43.394 --> 00:06:47.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just, the architecture that\nyou're describing, Adam, it seems like we\n\n125\n00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:50.926\nhave, you said a lot of different pieces\nto these puzzles so there's more to think\n\n126\n00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:54.448\nabout, so we have to think about not\nonly the information retained locally on\n\n127\n00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:57.790\nthat client's side, but also\nthe transmission back up to that server.\n\n128\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.450\nAnd then certain companies may have some\nsort of retention policy to have backups\n\n129\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.250\nfor their email server, so\nall of that's going to be a concern you\n\n130\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.790\ndon't just have one point of interest\nin this particular architecture.\n\n131\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n132\n00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.210\nLots and lots of moving pieces.\n\n133\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.570\nSome of them policy basis\nyou were just describing.\n\n134\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.670\nRetention policies will be really\nimportant thing for us to consider.\n\n135\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.433\nAnd almost probably without exemption\nwithin most companies today will have some\n\n136\n00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:22.736\nsort of policies as you were indicating,\nright.\n\n137\n00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:26.738\nEven if it is, and a lot of times people\nmistakes I do have this conversation,\n\n138\n00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:30.309\na lot with customers, with students\nwhen I'm in the field working,\n\n139\n00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:34.275\nauditing whatever the case may be a lack\nof policy is still a policy, right?\n\n140\n00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:38.605\nYou've made a decision specifically\nnot to address a certain item, you\n\n141\n00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:43.495\nmay have done that purposefully or through\na mission or just lack of oversight.\n\n142\n00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:47.300\nThere's different reasons why wind up not\nhaving something properly declared, or\n\n143\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.280\nperhaps stated and therefore as\na result communicated and standardized.\n\n144\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.075\nBut that's still a choice you're making.\n\n145\n00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:56.275\nAnd so there are policies in play for\na lot of these things.\n\n146\n00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:00.193\nWe may mandate, for instance, the kind of\nemail application that we'll have to use,\n\n147\n00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:03.144\nwe may have a Corporate desktop standard,\nan image or baseline,\n\n148\n00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:04.932\nyou often hear it referred to this way.\n\n149\n00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:08.504\nSo maybe your standard operating\nenvironment in a company is a Windows\n\n150\n00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:11.714\nbased machine, maybe Windows 7,\nmaybe Windows 10 today,\n\n151\n00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:13.177\nhard to say what it would be.\n\n152\n00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:18.350\nPerhaps Microsoft Office is used as your\nstandard, so Office 13, Office 16, again,\n\n153\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.320\nversioning not withstanding, that's\nthe thought process we would want to know.\n\n154\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.602\nMaybe instead, you're using\na Windows based system, but you're\n\n155\n00:08:26.602 --> 00:08:31.050\nusing Google Apps, the enterprise apps for\nGoogle Business, and you're using those..\n\n156\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.731\nSo instead of using Microsoft Office,\nyou're using a different system, and\n\n157\n00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:37.505\nthere's all sorts of\nthings that can go on.\n\n158\n00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:41.570\nAs an investigator, it's gonna be our job\nto figure out and document these things.\n\n159\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.035\nAs we've talked about extensively,\n\n160\n00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:45.927\nin every conversation we've had,\nin all the prior episodes up until now.\n\n161\n00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:47.492\nWe always come back to this idea of,\n\n162\n00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:50.432\nunderstand the operational\nenvironment we're stepping into.\n\n163\n00:08:50.432 --> 00:08:54.722\nIt's part of incident response,\nit's part of forensic investigation.\n\n164\n00:08:54.722 --> 00:08:57.766\nWe have to establish the boundaries\nof what we're gonna be able to do,\n\n165\n00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:58.810\nbased on what is there.\n\n166\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.747\nSo when I look at a system and\nI see it's running Microsoft and\n\n167\n00:09:01.747 --> 00:09:04.870\nI've got Office there,\nI have to be thinking in my mind, okay.\n\n168\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.287\nAs an investigator,\nthere's certain things I need to know,\n\n169\n00:09:07.287 --> 00:09:09.012\ncertain pieces of data I'm gonna look for.\n\n170\n00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:12.752\nThere'll be a PST or an OST or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n171\n00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:16.340\nIf it's a web based email system,\nand we're using a web frontend,\n\n172\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.330\nessentially just a browser to access it,\nwhether it's IE, whether it's Chrome,\n\n173\n00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.950\nwhether it's Firefox, whether it's Safari.\n\n174\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.549\nI could use any or all of those to access\na frontend for an Exchange online system,\n\n175\n00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:29.440\nfor instance.\n\n176\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.441\nI don't have to, like in the old days,\njust stick with IE,\n\n177\n00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:34.735\nI could essentially use\nalmost any browser.\n\n178\n00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:38.805\nAt least of the major ones that are out\nthere today, I could use almost any\n\n179\n00:09:38.805 --> 00:09:42.477\nbrowser, be able to access email\nthrough an Outlook Web Access or\n\n180\n00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:44.510\ntunneled connection over the web.\n\n181\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.820\nAnd as a result I may have to deal with\nthe peculiarities of that browser.\n\n182\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.290\nWhere does it store its information,\nwhere are the cache files?\n\n183\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.640\nDoes it cache passwords,\nand if it does, and\n\n184\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.610\nall browsers do, which is to do that,\nwhere will those items be?\n\n185\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.856\nHow will I access that temporary data, and\nmay vary a little bit, browser to browser.\n\n186\n00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:06.292\nCertain browsers may have security\nsettings that are specified by\n\n187\n00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:10.530\ndefault in a certain way, that may allow\nor deny things like previewing email.\n\n188\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.450\nAnd so attachments may or\nmay not be easily available locally,\n\n189\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.815\ncuz you may not have saved them,\nor even looked at them.\n\n190\n00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:21.606\nAnd that may or may not, as a result, have\nbeen the avenue for the attack if, let's\n\n191\n00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:26.129\nsay, somebody sent an email that perhaps\nhad an attachment that had malware or\n\n192\n00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:29.512\nsome sort of program that may\nlook to take over the system.\n\n193\n00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:31.098\nWe have malware forensics,\n\n194\n00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:35.930\nwe've talk about some of those things in\nprior episodes, prior discussions as well.\n\n195\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.452\nAnd when we think about rootkits that are\ninserted, when we think about the ability\n\n196\n00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:44.522\nto be able to RAT, remote access trojan,\na machine setting up a backdoor,\n\n197\n00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:47.980\nwhat we call a covert channel,\nto be able to communicate.\n\n198\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.488\nWe're thinking from an investigative\nstandpoint, okay, if the hacker did that,\n\n199\n00:10:52.488 --> 00:10:56.868\nwhat was the most likely avenue of attack,\nor the most likely used attack vector,\n\n200\n00:10:56.868 --> 00:10:58.151\nas we would refer to it.\n\n201\n00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:00.468\nHow did they submit that into the system,\nin other words,\n\n202\n00:11:00.468 --> 00:11:02.520\nhow did they get it in there,\nwas it through email?\n\n203\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.920\nIf it was, we may see evidence\nof that in the email system.\n\n204\n00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.008\nMaybe locally on the client,\nbut to Cherokee's point,\n\n205\n00:11:09.008 --> 00:11:11.078\nquite possibly on the server as well.\n\n206\n00:11:11.078 --> 00:11:15.374\nWe may see it in both places, because\nsomething that's stored on the server,\n\n207\n00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:19.870\ndepending on the server architecture,\ntypes of email systems that we have.\n\n208\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.005\nWe may see that email is stored at the\nserver, and made available for us to view,\n\n209\n00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:26.374\nand perhaps download locally, our choice.\n\n210\n00:11:26.374 --> 00:11:29.835\nIt may be stored and forwarded, so\nthat when we connect it is removed from\n\n211\n00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:33.470\nthe server, brought down locally,\nand no record of it left behind.\n\n212\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.362\nSo it really just depends on\nthe kind of system we use.\n\n213\n00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:40.261\nAnd depending on that, again, we would\nhave to know, or at least delve into and\n\n214\n00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:44.070\nunderstand better, the architecture\nof the server side of the system.\n\n215\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.579\nTo get a sense of whether we have to\ngo do an investigation at the provider,\n\n216\n00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:51.484\nthe Internet service provider, the mail\nprovider, whatever we will call them,\n\n217\n00:11:51.484 --> 00:11:52.465\nwhatever they are.\n\n218\n00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:55.802\nWhether that's hosted on-prem,\nwhether it is off-prem, and\n\n219\n00:11:55.802 --> 00:11:58.055\nthen today more and\nmore through the cloud.\n\n220\n00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:02.674\nWe're seeing a lot of these systems that\ntraditionally have been owned by corporate\n\n221\n00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:04.480\nIT migrating to the outside.\n\n222\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.960\nTo third party vendors, through some\nsort of private off-prem cloud scenario.\n\n223\n00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.206\nThink Microsoft Office 365,\nthink Amazon Web Services,\n\n224\n00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:16.972\nthink the Azure Fabric,\nthink VMware's vCloud Air.\n\n225\n00:12:16.972 --> 00:12:21.277\nWhatever it is, whoever's providing it,\ndoesn't really matter whose name is on\n\n226\n00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:24.888\nthat particular service agreement\nin terms of who you buy from.\n\n227\n00:12:24.888 --> 00:12:28.900\nBut as an independent investigator or\nsomebody who works for the company that's\n\n228\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.230\nbeen attacked and has to now go unravel\nthat, you've gotta understand that.\n\n229\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.526\nAnd one of the very first things we\nkeep coming back to is this idea\n\n230\n00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:36.870\nof the reconnaissance and\n\n231\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.856\nthe understanding of the lay of the land\nas you go to open up an investigation.\n\n232\n00:12:40.856 --> 00:12:42.884\nWhat are the parameters\nwe have to be aware of,\n\n233\n00:12:42.884 --> 00:12:45.640\nwhat are the properties of the system,\nwhat are the policies,\n\n234\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.340\nas Cherokee pointed out,\nthat may or may not be in place?\n\n235\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.445\nWe have to document all this before we\ntouch a system, before we do anything,\n\n236\n00:12:52.445 --> 00:12:55.556\nbefore we start going actively looking for\ninformation.\n\n237\n00:12:55.556 --> 00:12:59.880\nWe have to have a sketch and literally a\nblueprint, an understanding of the system.\n\n238\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.680\nIf we don’t have that architectural\ndiagram, it’s very difficult for\n\n239\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.820\nus to know for sure that we’re\nengaging in the right activities,\n\n240\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.350\nin the right systems, at the right time.\n\n241\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.300\nAnd most importantly, that we’re doing so\nin a forensically sound way, that will\n\n242\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.600\nnot violate the issues and the concerns\nand the rules that we have to follow.\n\n243\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.830\nDo no harm, preserve evidence,\nthings like that, we may be\n\n244\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.295\ntrampling on the very evidence we\nare looking to understand how to acquire.\n\n245\n00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:26.560\nCuz we are not aware of what it is, and\nunder what conditions it may be accessed.\n\n246\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.785\nSo these are very important\nthings to consider.\n\n247\n00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:31.424\n&gt;&gt; And even with the advent of\nour mobile devices here, and\n\n248\n00:13:31.424 --> 00:13:35.637\nyou mentioned the different variables, the\ndifferent browsers that we may encounter,\n\n249\n00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:38.640\neven the different operating systems for\nour mobile devices.\n\n250\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.660\nSo Apple inherently will go ahead and\nsave passwords there on that local device.\n\n251\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.578\nI don't know about the Android devices,\nI'm not too acclimated with that, but you\n\n252\n00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:51.734\ncan't just, you have to unturn every stone\nwhenever you're creating that blueprint.\n\n253\n00:13:51.734 --> 00:13:55.349\nBecause there are just so many little\npieces to this overall puzzle here.\n\n254\n00:13:55.349 --> 00:13:58.784\n&gt;&gt; We do, and yeah, we've had or\nwill have in upcoming conversation some\n\n255\n00:13:58.784 --> 00:14:03.160\ndiscussions about mobile devices, mobile\nforensics, and things of that nature.\n\n256\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.190\nIs there a passcode, if there is,\n\n257\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.420\nhow many shots do you get at entering it\nright before you lock out the device?\n\n258\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.507\nWe've probably all had issues surrounding\nthat or at least are aware of that.\n\n259\n00:14:11.507 --> 00:14:15.452\nAnd every device in some form will\nstore those passwords locally,\n\n260\n00:14:15.452 --> 00:14:20.220\nmay have extra security added on or not,\ndepending on what you choose to do.\n\n261\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.674\nIt's rare today that you look\nat someone's mobile device and\n\n262\n00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:25.094\nthey don't have a passcode or\nsome sort of lockout feature.\n\n263\n00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:28.891\nCuz they just don't want people randomly\npicking up a device, if somebody's there,\n\n264\n00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:30.565\nusing it, so that's pretty common.\n\n265\n00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:32.702\nBut it may not be consistently common,\n\n266\n00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:36.280\nthere are systems that don't\nhave those features enabled.\n\n267\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.498\nWhen we think about email systems,\nwe probably wanna take a step back and\n\n268\n00:14:39.498 --> 00:14:43.400\nthink about the three kinds of server\narchitectures and protocols that we see.\n\n269\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.918\nSo we have traditionally SMTP,\n\n270\n00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:50.590\nsimple mail transfer protocol,\nport 25, the idea behind that,\n\n271\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.540\nprobably most standard version of\nan email system that we see today.\n\n272\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.366\nNot because we don't use the others,\nPOP3 and IMAP4, we use them extensively\n\n273\n00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:02.145\nas well, but SMTP is really the corporate\nstandard that we're using for mail.\n\n274\n00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:06.749\nRuns on port 25, very important to know\nour ports associated with our protocols.\n\n275\n00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:09.392\nThat will store information\nin an email system,\n\n276\n00:15:09.392 --> 00:15:12.130\nallowing us to access\nit with an application.\n\n277\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.410\nSome sort of mail client, web-based\nand/or some sort of desktop-based client.\n\n278\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.660\nLeave a copy on the server, access it,\nread it, perhaps download a copy locally\n\n279\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.430\nand cache it so it's in both places,\nand SMTP will allow us to do that.\n\n280\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.620\nWe can delete it from the server,\ncertainly, and have it reside in our local\n\n281\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.160\narchive for a period of time and\ndelete it there as well.\n\n282\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.380\nSo we have the flexibility with\nSMTP to do a lot of things.\n\n283\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.691\nPOP3, Post Office Protocol,\nfun to say those kind of things, right?.\n\n284\n00:15:39.691 --> 00:15:42.285\nPOP3, almost like popcorn, but POP3.\n\n285\n00:15:42.285 --> 00:15:45.871\nSo, POP3, 3 just being the version of\nthe protocol that's currently in use.\n\n286\n00:15:45.871 --> 00:15:49.628\nPOP itself has been around for\na long time, runs on port 110,\n\n287\n00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:52.491\nthat's what we call a store and\nforward system.\n\n288\n00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:55.913\nThis is an older kind of a mail system\nthat would just act as a bridge and\n\n289\n00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.276\na gathering point, a repository for\ninformation that is stored for\n\n290\n00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:02.993\na period of time until you connect And\nthen you download that information,\n\n291\n00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:06.946\nit is actually pushed to you through\na forwarding mechanism and the information\n\n292\n00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:10.720\ndoes not stay on the server, I mean\nthe emails do not stay on the server.\n\n293\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.300\nThey are just gonna transit\nthrough there on their way to you,\n\n294\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.712\nwherever you are, you'll download them.\n\n295\n00:16:15.712 --> 00:16:19.560\nKnowing that, or at least understanding\nthat, if we were dealing with a pop client\n\n296\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.810\nwe would have to understand that\nthere's probably very limited data\n\n297\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.800\nthat we would wanna investigate and\ngather from the email server and\n\n298\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.350\nfrom the provider,\nin terms of the actual emails themselves.\n\n299\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.687\nThere are,\nunless we have not connected recently,\n\n300\n00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:35.139\nand perhaps there's some emails sitting\nin the cache there, just waiting,\n\n301\n00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:39.150\nor in the queue, waiting to be delivered\nto this device, we won't find any emails.\n\n302\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:44.060\nWhat we will find though,\nare log entries, and time stamps, and\n\n303\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.740\ninformation about system activity.\n\n304\n00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.260\nWho said what to whom, where did\nit come from, when did it come in,\n\n305\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.660\nwhat port was used, what IP address was\nused, what Mac addresses were used.\n\n306\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.810\nThose kind of things will be resident,\nat least for a period of time anyway\n\n307\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.070\nin the logs on the server, and\ndepending on the kind of architecture and\n\n308\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.530\ninfrastructure surrounding that server,\nwe may have Raduis servers, for instance,\n\n309\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.290\nat play there allowing us to be able\nto get into the environment and\n\n310\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.280\nauthenticate and as a result there may be\na more extensive auto trail of traffic and\n\n311\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.430\ntraffic management.\n\n312\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.470\nSo we have to think about the fact that\nthere are widening circles of interaction\n\n313\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.220\nwe would have to engage with or at least\nas an investigator have knowledge of.\n\n314\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.642\nThere is also IMAP 4,\nIMAP 4 runs on port 143.\n\n315\n00:17:26.642 --> 00:17:31.450\nThat access a file server much like SMTP\ndoes, the idea is that it will store our\n\n316\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.610\nmail, allow us to gather information\nby using a client to access it,\n\n317\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.900\nleave it there on the server,\nhave a copy available to us and\n\n318\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.130\nwork with if we choose to,\nby reading the mail through the server.\n\n319\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.930\nWe can leave it there, download it,\nit's up to us to decide.\n\n320\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.862\nBut IMAP and SMTP operate very similarly.\n\n321\n00:17:47.862 --> 00:17:51.018\nPOP3 is really the outlier there in terms\nof the store and forward capability.\n\n322\n00:17:51.018 --> 00:17:53.500\nSo, so you wanna be thinking about\nthat but it is important for\n\n323\n00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.320\nus to have a sense of these protocols,\nthese ports, how they operate,\n\n324\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.230\nwhat the key defining characteristics\nwill be, number one if you're\n\n325\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.220\nplanning on taking an exam, always good\nto be able to identify that information.\n\n326\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.550\nIf you are gonna become\nan investigator in the real world,\n\n327\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.460\nput these skills to use and\nhopefully you will, then you're gonna\n\n328\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.040\nhave to understand the different email\nsystems that you will trip across or find.\n\n329\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.170\nYou also,\nif you are going to be not perhaps\n\n330\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.930\npracticing these skills on a regular\nbasis, but in an advisory capacity,\n\n331\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.800\nworking as part of a broader instant or\nresponse team, or\n\n332\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.880\njust in general as an IT professional\nthat engages in security and\n\n333\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.040\non occasion may do insinuate response,\nit will be helpful to have this\n\n334\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.820\nkind of information because it makes\nyou a stronger component of that team.\n\n335\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.336\nA more valued contributor to\nthe activities of that organization, and\n\n336\n00:18:38.336 --> 00:18:42.202\nbecause of that, you're gonna be able\nto offer the proper amount of insight,\n\n337\n00:18:42.202 --> 00:18:45.308\nguidance, and direction if\nsomebody needs some assistance or\n\n338\n00:18:45.308 --> 00:18:47.260\nasks your opinion about for instance.\n\n339\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.097\nSo it's always very important to\nspeak knowledgeably about this or\n\n340\n00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.090\nthat whatever the subject may be.\n\n341\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.000\nWhat about email itself?\n\n342\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.580\nThere's a lot of different\nthings that go in to email.\n\n343\n00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.870\nEmail is not just this stream of text or\ndata or pictures and all sorts of stuff\n\n344\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.460\nthat comes along, there’s a lot to it and\nthere’s actually quite a number of things,\n\n345\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.440\nspecifically parts that we can\nbreak email down into, yes.\n\n346\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam if we break these down\nand dissect these individual parts, or\n\n347\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.910\nthe anatomy of an email,\n\n348\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.756\nwhat are the main areas that we\nshould really be looking at here?\n\n349\n00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:19.972\n&gt;&gt; Well, so we could think of an email,\nprobably traditionally be broken up into,\n\n350\n00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:23.447\nat least on the surface anyway\nInto three distinct parts, right?\n\n351\n00:19:23.447 --> 00:19:27.217\nWe could think about it being made\nup of a header, and most messages,\n\n352\n00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:31.442\nmost data that we will talk about sending\nand receiving at the network level,\n\n353\n00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:35.342\nthink the OSI model for a minute if that,\ndoesn't give you a shudder and\n\n354\n00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:39.072\nperhaps some idea of running away\nscreaming from the screen right.\n\n355\n00:19:39.072 --> 00:19:42.540\nIf you think about the OSI model and\nour ability to dissect and\n\n356\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.689\nwe'll break down the function of two\nsystems transmitting to each other\n\n357\n00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:51.178\nthrough a seven layer stack, and\nwhat functionality occurs at those layers,\n\n358\n00:19:51.178 --> 00:19:53.966\nwe talk about the data\nheader of the data packet,\n\n359\n00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:58.750\nand really the information contained\nthere in Layers 4, and Layer 3, Layer 2.\n\n360\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.850\nWe really think about the logic,\nwhat goes in the front end there, right?\n\n361\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.680\nSo the header would be one of the key\ncomponents of an email message or\n\n362\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.420\nthe parts of an email you wanna look at.\n\n363\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.570\nWhat is the addressing information, just\nlike a data packet header would be, right?\n\n364\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.120\nSender and receiver, to and from, if you\nwanna think in terms of email and sending.\n\n365\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.900\nIP address, Mac address, probably not\ngonna see Mac address, would see an IP\n\n366\n00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:25.950\naddress, would see information about the\nsystems that may have touched that email.\n\n367\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.495\nWe will see some system information, time\nstamps, travel or transit information,\n\n368\n00:20:31.495 --> 00:20:34.905\nalmost like looking at your passport and\nlooking at the visa stamps and\n\n369\n00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:36.545\nthe different countries that\nyou've been in on a trip.\n\n370\n00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:39.735\nWe can tell by date and time, more or\nless what your itinerary was, right.\n\n371\n00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:42.165\nWhere you went, and how you got there.\n\n372\n00:20:42.165 --> 00:20:48.010\nSo we would see all of that, we may see\ninformation about different addresses and\n\n373\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.580\nthere may be an alias that's\nbeing used to send an email,\n\n374\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.770\nwe would see information about that.\n\n375\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.290\nSo there' a lot of stuff that would be\nvaluable in the header and it's often one\n\n376\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.375\nof those places that the average IT\nprofessional really doesn't think of and\n\n377\n00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:02.945\nperhaps overlooks when they look at email\nbecause you have to go out of your way to\n\n378\n00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:06.155\nlook at the header of a message,\nit's not normally part of the display and\n\n379\n00:21:06.155 --> 00:21:09.480\nhow we have email set up to\nrender in most applications.\n\n380\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.310\nThe data's there, we just essentially\nhide it, we just you know mask it, and\n\n381\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.660\ndon't show it be default, because\nthere's really no value, traditionally,\n\n382\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.520\nin looking at that, at least not if you're\njust reading the email normally, right?\n\n383\n00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.520\nThere's just really no reason to go in and\nsay, hey,\n\n384\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.950\ndid this really come from IP\naddress 1.2.3.4 at system,\n\n385\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.710\nsend mail dot whatever,\nyou don't really need to know that.\n\n386\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.190\nIt's just not part of\nwhat you need to know.\n\n387\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.540\nYou wanna read the email,\n\n388\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.600\nwhich would be the second part\nof the email thought process,\n\n389\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.690\nwe could break this into the body of\nthe email, is really where we would look.\n\n390\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.545\nThat's the content itself.\n\n391\n00:21:37.545 --> 00:21:41.975\nData, the bits, the bytes, the actual\nwords, the attachments, things of that\n\n392\n00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:46.555\nnature, the structure and form of what\nmakes the email itself would be the body.\n\n393\n00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.365\nAnd then we have what's\ncalled the signature,\n\n394\n00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:50.015\nthis is just the part of the body.\n\n395\n00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:53.122\nIt would be whatever information\nis tagged on the mail and\n\n396\n00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:56.812\nprovided for\nsomebody to identify themselves, right, so\n\n397\n00:21:56.812 --> 00:22:01.322\nit may be a logo of the corporation, a\npicture, it could be contact info, right.\n\n398\n00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:03.272\nThis is my phone number,\n\n399\n00:22:03.272 --> 00:22:07.372\nthis is my email address, this is\nthe business address, here's our website,\n\n400\n00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:10.532\nthe standard stuff we would often\nthink of that goes into a signature.\n\n401\n00:22:10.532 --> 00:22:11.722\nThat could be templated, so\n\n402\n00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:14.850\nit's just gonna be stamped on\nevery email looking the same way.\n\n403\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.450\nIt may be something that's just crafted\nuniquely by the sender when they send it\n\n404\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.790\nthat one time.\n\n405\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.760\nWhatever it is, it's really hard to say,\nbut it will be that, and there may be\n\n406\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.030\na lot of information in each of these\nareas, but remember, two of them we often\n\n407\n00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.900\nsee, the body, the signature we will often\nsee in the email, even if we preview it,\n\n408\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.740\nwe'll see part of it, we may not see all\nof it, but we will tend to see part of it.\n\n409\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.580\nWhen you preview,\nyou may block things like graphic files.\n\n410\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.250\nSo, the pictures may not show\nup in the application or\n\n411\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.620\nthe browser when you preview email, for\nsecurity reasons or just other reasons,\n\n412\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.660\nbandwidth management, low latency or\nhigh latency, low bandwidth conditions.\n\n413\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.490\nYou may not choose to download those large\nfiles and put them in but you would see\n\n414\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.780\nthem if you choose to view the email\nfully, so they are gonna be there.\n\n415\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.505\nIt's a question of what we choose to see.\n\n416\n00:22:59.505 --> 00:23:03.592\nBut one thing people often have to think\nabout and forget when we look at this is,\n\n417\n00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:06.581\nin the signature itself,\nthere usually is information,\n\n418\n00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:08.657\nespecially if the email is fraudulent.\n\n419\n00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:12.966\nIf it's a phishing email of some kind,\nso it's an email that perhaps has been\n\n420\n00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:17.341\ncrafted to get us to click through, and\nas a result of clicking through a link or\n\n421\n00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:21.121\nsomething in there, we are being\nredirected and we are being sent to\n\n422\n00:23:21.121 --> 00:23:24.980\na system that may choose or\ntry to load malware into our systems.\n\n423\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.850\nThere are various things\nthat can happen and\n\n424\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.340\none of the things we have to think\nabout and educate our end users about\n\n425\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.710\nfrom a proactive security perspective is\nhow do we preview emails, and how do we\n\n426\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.640\npreview links in emails to see what they\nresolve to without clicking on them?\n\n427\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.400\nAnd, the ability to\npreview those links and\n\n428\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.820\nhover them and have them resolve in those\nlittle pop-up, text bars that show up or\n\n429\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.510\nthose little pop-up areas\nthat will preview for\n\n430\n00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.440\nus that show us without clicking through\nwhat the resolution of that link is.\n\n431\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.877\nThe link may say, click here to login.\n\n432\n00:23:54.877 --> 00:23:57.618\nBut we don't really know what click\nhere to login takes us to do.\n\n433\n00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:00.195\nWe just know that it says if I click here,\nI'm logging in.\n\n434\n00:24:00.195 --> 00:24:01.113\nBut logging in to where?\n\n435\n00:24:01.113 --> 00:24:02.077\nLogging in to what?\n\n436\n00:24:02.077 --> 00:24:04.199\nWho's gonna talk to me,\nwho am I gonna talk to?\n\n437\n00:24:04.199 --> 00:24:08.246\nThat's what we have to think about, and in\nemails, we will often find when we go back\n\n438\n00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:12.239\nand examine forensically evidence of\nthese kinds of attacks, phishing attacks,\n\n439\n00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:13.569\ncuz the evidence is there.\n\n440\n00:24:13.569 --> 00:24:18.109\nThe link has been redirected, and\nwhen we examine the email, open it up,\n\n441\n00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:22.285\nforensically examine those hyperlinks and\nsee that they point to,\n\n442\n00:24:22.285 --> 00:24:24.860\ninstall malware server one.\n\n443\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.000\nWe know that there's something going on,\nthis is the thought process.\n\n444\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.340\nSo, these three areas, headers,\n\n445\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.262\nbody, and signature, are gonna be\nthe areas that we would often think about.\n\n446\n00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:36.681\n&gt;&gt; And attackers really like those bit.ly,\nthose shortened types of addresses for\n\n447\n00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:40.408\nthat exact purpose, and some of\nthe terms that you were using there.\n\n448\n00:24:40.408 --> 00:24:41.984\nI had a question for you Adam,\n\n449\n00:24:41.984 --> 00:24:45.656\nit seems like a lot of that information\ncould be modified or spoofed.\n\n450\n00:24:45.656 --> 00:24:49.255\nYou compared the header to a packet or\n\n451\n00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:54.201\neven a passport, and so those types of-\n&gt;&gt; Well the header of a data packet,\n\n452\n00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:54.701\nspecifically.\n\n453\n00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:56.325\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the header of the-\n&gt;&gt; Not the packet itself,\n\n454\n00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:57.496\npacket itself would be the body.\n\n455\n00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:01.714\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so I know we're able to\nmodify packet header information and\n\n456\n00:25:01.714 --> 00:25:03.680\nmanipulate that.\n\n457\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.061\nAnd, even looking at a passport\nit's potentially, unlikely, but\n\n458\n00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:09.989\npotentially someone could\nmodify a passport as well, so-\n\n459\n00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:10.811\n&gt;&gt; Not supposed to say those things.\n\n460\n00:25:10.811 --> 00:25:15.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So when we're looking at if\nfrom an investigative point of view,\n\n461\n00:25:15.505 --> 00:25:19.983\nhow likely would it be that I can\nreally rely upon this information?\n\n462\n00:25:19.983 --> 00:25:25.747\nOr what would be my best use case of\nreally examining this information?\n\n463\n00:25:25.747 --> 00:25:28.800\nWhere would I really be able to obtain and\nbenefit from this info?\n\n464\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, in terms of examining it,\n\n465\n00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.680\nyou're gonna examine it by looking at\nthe e-mail, by looking at the header.\n\n466\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.497\nBut in terms of what you can get from, and\nthere are tools we can use to do that.\n\n467\n00:25:37.497 --> 00:25:40.637\nAlmost any, actually any email\nclient on the planet that you use,\n\n468\n00:25:40.637 --> 00:25:43.789\neither application or web based,\ncan show you the email headers.\n\n469\n00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:47.215\nProvided you turn on that capability or\nallow them to be seen, as I said,\n\n470\n00:25:47.215 --> 00:25:49.080\ntraditionally, those are filtered.\n\n471\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.626\nThey're just not shown by default,\nbut they're there.\n\n472\n00:25:51.626 --> 00:25:54.805\nIt's not like we suddenly dynamically\ncreate them and add them to the email.\n\n473\n00:25:54.805 --> 00:25:57.109\nWhen you say, I wanna see them,\nthey're always there.\n\n474\n00:25:57.109 --> 00:26:00.620\nIt's the standard, generic structure of\na data packet that we're talking about.\n\n475\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.384\nSo that stuff will be resident there,\nyou just have to enable the viewing of\n\n476\n00:26:04.384 --> 00:26:07.254\nthem with either the client or\nspecial forensics tools,\n\n477\n00:26:07.254 --> 00:26:11.462\nthat we will use to recover data after the\nfact, and then we can examine the header.\n\n478\n00:26:11.462 --> 00:26:13.275\nThat's really just\na matter of turning it on.\n\n479\n00:26:13.275 --> 00:26:17.279\nOr if we're doing it after the fact\nforensically, using an application that\n\n480\n00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.281\nrecovers either emails from a local cache,\na PST, or an OST file from a server\n\n481\n00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:24.997\nif we're looking online, or\nsome combination of those those things.\n\n482\n00:26:24.997 --> 00:26:28.132\nPulls those emails out, and\nthen allows us to do that deep dive and\n\n483\n00:26:28.132 --> 00:26:29.570\nthat forensic examination.\n\n484\n00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.260\nSo, we can do that,\nthere's many ways to do it.\n\n485\n00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.940\nWhat we get from it, what are the kind\nof things we would see, well,\n\n486\n00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.430\nthere's a variety of different things.\n\n487\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:41.500\nWe would see the return path, so as I\nsuggested, where did the e-mail come from?\n\n488\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.589\nWhere is it going to,\nis that return path legitimated?\n\n489\n00:26:44.589 --> 00:26:47.769\nMeaning, is it really cherokee@itpro.tv,\nor\n\n490\n00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:51.403\nis it what we think was\nCherokee's e-mail address, but\n\n491\n00:26:51.403 --> 00:26:56.951\nit goes off to Spam Central or whatever it\nis, and that's obviously gonna be spoofed.\n\n492\n00:26:56.951 --> 00:27:00.300\nIt's gonna be masquerading as something,\nand that's gonna validate or\n\n493\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.120\ninvalidate the fact that we do have or\ndon't have a legitimate communication.\n\n494\n00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.552\nThe recipient's email address, the type\nof sending email service, as I mentioned,\n\n495\n00:27:07.552 --> 00:27:08.640\nwould typically be there.\n\n496\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.840\nThe IP address of both sender and\nreceiver is captured.\n\n497\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.141\nThe names of the email server or servers,\n\n498\n00:27:14.141 --> 00:27:17.509\ngateways we've passed through,\nwould be available to us.\n\n499\n00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:19.788\nSome sort of unique tracking ID for\nthe message,\n\n500\n00:27:19.788 --> 00:27:23.460\nthere's always gonna be a unique stamp for\nthat message in that system.\n\n501\n00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.207\nThink of it as a sequence number\nin a data package generically,\n\n502\n00:27:27.207 --> 00:27:30.262\nwe're 10 of 25 uniquely\nidentified this way.\n\n503\n00:27:30.262 --> 00:27:33.507\nSo we're gonna be able to track that and\nlook at not just that, but\n\n504\n00:27:33.507 --> 00:27:36.693\nlook at other email systems, or\nrather, in that email system,\n\n505\n00:27:36.693 --> 00:27:39.980\nlook at other emails around that,\nboth before and after.\n\n506\n00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.400\nSo, the idea of being able to see what\nwas being sent through the system over\n\n507\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.300\na period, and whether this one stands\nout against the background noise,\n\n508\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.040\nis something we can look at from\na unique tracking perspective.\n\n509\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.538\nDate and time stamps, I think I mentioned\nthat before, also attachment info.\n\n510\n00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:56.279\nAll of that's part of what we would\nsee traditionally in the header.\n\n511\n00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:58.683\nSo, those are all things\nthat can be looked for, and\n\n512\n00:27:58.683 --> 00:28:01.156\nthose are the kinda things\nyou would gain value from.\n\n513\n00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:02.705\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; If you think about the logic of it,\n\n514\n00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:05.002\nwhat you would see in the email header,\nin other words.\n\n515\n00:28:05.002 --> 00:28:08.210\nSo there's a lot, lot of potential\ninformation in the header.\n\n516\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.710\nIt's probably one of the most\nrichest sources of information,\n\n517\n00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.840\nor richest source of information, we can\nfind forensically as we examine email.\n\n518\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.770\nThere's a lot to be found on the body,\nthere's a lot certainly potentially,\n\n519\n00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.480\nas I said, that may be good or\nbad in the signature.\n\n520\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.792\nBut it's of limited value in the sense\nthat it's obvious that the signature has\n\n521\n00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:28.865\nbeen modified and links are spoofed.\n\n522\n00:28:28.865 --> 00:28:30.423\nThat's a pretty quick check and\n\n523\n00:28:30.423 --> 00:28:33.317\nthat stands out pretty easily\nif we know what we're doing.\n\n524\n00:28:33.317 --> 00:28:37.369\nThe body itself is traditionally not\ngonna have anything of significance or\n\n525\n00:28:37.369 --> 00:28:41.180\nconsequence, except perhaps\nan attachment that's part of the body.\n\n526\n00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.780\nIf there's malware there in an attachment,\nobviously, we would find that, but\n\n527\n00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.070\nthe message itself traditionally doesn't\nreally yield much if any information.\n\n528\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.530\nMeet me tonight for dinner at 7 o'clock.\n\n529\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.935\nThat's just not gonna really tell us much,\n\n530\n00:28:53.935 --> 00:28:56.995\nunless it is part of a broader\ncriminal investigation.\n\n531\n00:28:56.995 --> 00:29:01.680\nAnd that email is part of establishing\nsome sort of accurate representation\n\n532\n00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.490\nof an alibi.\n\n533\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.914\nYes, you were where you said you\nwere gonna be, no you were not.\n\n534\n00:29:04.914 --> 00:29:07.282\nYou did send this email at this time,\nno, you didn't.\n\n535\n00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:10.800\nThere's things that criminalistically\nwould be valuable about the email.\n\n536\n00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.400\nBut the body itself,\nfrom a forensic standpoint,\n\n537\n00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.230\nin terms of computer-related crimes,\nIf it's a phishing email,\n\n538\n00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.140\nthe body is gonna tell us,\nyeah, it's a phishing email.\n\n539\n00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.460\nWe look at it, we can see that you\ndon't have a rich uncle in Africa or\n\n540\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.350\nin the Middle East or\nin wherever somewhere who wants to send\n\n541\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.270\nyou $200 million if you just forward\nyour bank account information.\n\n542\n00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.340\nWe can pretty much quickly\ntell that's gonna be the case.\n\n543\n00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.826\nSo while we spend tome on the body, spend\ntime on the signature, of the three, as I\n\n544\n00:29:35.826 --> 00:29:40.187\nsaid, the header is probably the richest\nmining activities that we engage in,\n\n545\n00:29:40.187 --> 00:29:43.793\nforensically, we find the most\nvalue there more often than not.\n\n546\n00:29:43.793 --> 00:29:45.771\nSo, we've talked about\nwhat can be in the header,\n\n547\n00:29:45.771 --> 00:29:48.250\nwe've talked about the value\nof what's in the header.\n\n548\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.655\nLet's talk about two other things,\n\n549\n00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:52.640\nI was alluding to some email\ncrimes just a minute ago.\n\n550\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.078\nThings that can go on, and\nthat are propagated through email,\n\n551\n00:29:55.078 --> 00:29:57.341\nprobably important just to\nthink through the logic of it.\n\n552\n00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:01.863\nWe've all, I'm sure, had access to,\nor seen, or been the recipient of,\n\n553\n00:30:01.863 --> 00:30:04.834\nemails that fall into these categories,\nmore and\n\n554\n00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:08.104\nmore today, things like spam,\nbeen around forever.\n\n555\n00:30:08.104 --> 00:30:11.514\nWe actually see, more and\nmore today, believe it or not,\n\n556\n00:30:11.514 --> 00:30:16.332\nsome studies have shown, that up to 80%\nof all emails that are sent worldwide.\n\n557\n00:30:16.332 --> 00:30:20.824\nSo if you think about it, four out of five\nemails globally in our systems around\n\n558\n00:30:20.824 --> 00:30:25.127\nthe world, at any point in time,\nare thought to be spam or spam-related.\n\n559\n00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:28.730\nSo almost every email that we send\nhas some component of spam or\n\n560\n00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.617\nsomething associated with it.\n\n561\n00:30:30.617 --> 00:30:33.156\nNot that you're sending necessarily,\nbut generically,\n\n562\n00:30:33.156 --> 00:30:34.865\njust email sent in the system broadly.\n\n563\n00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:37.838\nFour-fifths of all that traffic,\nimagine the billions,\n\n564\n00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:40.697\nliterally, billions of emails\nthat are sent every day.\n\n565\n00:30:40.697 --> 00:30:42.687\n&gt;&gt; Huge amount of waste.\n&gt;&gt; And that four-fifths of those,\n\n566\n00:30:42.687 --> 00:30:45.331\npotentiality, are spam, or\nsome way related to spam.\n\n567\n00:30:45.331 --> 00:30:48.371\nA lot of email, that's just essentially-\n&gt;&gt; Bandwidth, human time.\n\n568\n00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:48.979\n&gt;&gt; That we got rid of.\n\n569\n00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:50.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, yeah.\n\n570\n00:30:50.867 --> 00:30:52.947\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention the malware and all\nthe things that can go along with that.\n\n571\n00:30:52.947 --> 00:30:54.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All the bad stuff that would go on or\n\n572\n00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:58.323\npotentially could go on if somebody\nclicked on those, so that's bad.\n\n573\n00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:01.080\nWe have what's called mail bombing and\nmail storms.\n\n574\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.645\nThe idea is a mail storm is a DOS\nare distributed or DDOS or DOS,\n\n575\n00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:09.117\nthought process, mailbombing is more\nof a DOS process, Denial of Service.\n\n576\n00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:13.358\nYou're sending bad stuff in and trying to\nget somebody to click on it to set it off,\n\n577\n00:31:13.358 --> 00:31:17.048\nessentially taking out one or\nmore systems, it could propagate that,\n\n578\n00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:19.339\nobviously, it would be multiple systems.\n\n579\n00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:22.029\nA mail storm is a broadcast\nkind of attack,\n\n580\n00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:26.535\nyou're spamming somebody with\ntremendous amounts of email inbound.\n\n581\n00:31:26.535 --> 00:31:29.738\nTrying to overwhelm their capabilities,\nwe call it a mail storm\n\n582\n00:31:29.738 --> 00:31:33.494\nwhen we focus that as a a denial or\ndistributed denial of service activity.\n\n583\n00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:36.755\nSpam as a generic, categorical\nrepresentation of what that email looks\n\n584\n00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:39.702\nlike when it's just garbage and\ntotally irrelevant to us, yes.\n\n585\n00:31:39.702 --> 00:31:44.172\n&gt;&gt; And something like a mail relay would\nhelp mitigate those types of attacks if we\n\n586\n00:31:44.172 --> 00:31:46.283\nhad one configured for our network?\n\n587\n00:31:46.283 --> 00:31:49.031\n&gt;&gt; Well, very careful with mail relay,\nquite the opposite, actually.\n\n588\n00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:52.049\nIf we have an open mail relay,\nit actually propagates these attacks and\n\n589\n00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:52.864\nmakes them worse.\n\n590\n00:31:52.864 --> 00:31:55.016\nSo we definitely have to be specific and\n\n591\n00:31:55.016 --> 00:31:58.092\nvery careful about what we\ntalk about with mail relays.\n\n592\n00:31:58.092 --> 00:32:02.147\nThe historical problem with mail relaying,\nis that if it's what I just defined,\n\n593\n00:32:02.147 --> 00:32:05.281\nan open relay, a relay that will\nallow strangers to talk to it.\n\n594\n00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:06.098\nYou and I actually,\n\n595\n00:32:06.098 --> 00:32:08.940\nbefore we got started We're chatting\na little bit about DNS, right?\n\n596\n00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Remember the whole idea of how we do\n\n597\n00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:13.611\nzone transfers and talking to strangers\nand the history of all that, right?\n\n598\n00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Stranger danger, yeah.\n\n599\n00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.100\n&gt;&gt; So when we think about\nthe same idea with open relays,\n\n600\n00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.800\nwhen we have an open mail relay,\n\n601\n00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.670\nan open relay of any kind, we're allowing\nanybody without any authentication or\n\n602\n00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.020\nany idea of who they are to send or\nreceive and essentially propagate traffic.\n\n603\n00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.980\nLet's just broaden it,\nwhether it's email or not.\n\n604\n00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.100\nPropagate and\nbroadcast through that relay,\n\n605\n00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.760\nthat chokepoint or\nthat management point for traffic flow.\n\n606\n00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.480\nThat's what a relay is.\n\n607\n00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.493\nMail relays are systems that\nwill simply propagate and\n\n608\n00:32:39.493 --> 00:32:41.988\nsend mail on, either into or\nout of a system.\n\n609\n00:32:41.988 --> 00:32:45.120\nIf it's an open relay,\nit requires no authentication.\n\n610\n00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.420\nIt has no access control\nof any kind to validate or\n\n611\n00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.670\nverify who's connecting to that relay.\n\n612\n00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.900\nYou have an open relay?\n\n613\n00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.403\nYou're done, right, [LAUGH] because you're\nbeing used by every spambot in the world\n\n614\n00:32:54.403 --> 00:32:56.360\nand you're on every blacklist,\nmost likely.\n\n615\n00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.845\nBecause you're not gonna be able to\nsend mail to anybody cuz nobody wants to\n\n616\n00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:00.464\ntalk to you.\n\n617\n00:33:00.464 --> 00:33:02.180\nBecause they know that\nfour times out of five,\n\n618\n00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.038\nyou're probably sending them garbage,\nright?\n\n619\n00:33:04.038 --> 00:33:05.654\nYou're sending them spam.\nIt's a bad thing.\n\n620\n00:33:05.654 --> 00:33:10.048\nSo mail relays can be problematic,\nif they are set up and locked down so\n\n621\n00:33:10.048 --> 00:33:14.743\nthat the essentially or control with\nsome sort of access mechanism whether\n\n622\n00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:17.735\nit's an IP allows,\nwhether it's a user list.\n\n623\n00:33:17.735 --> 00:33:19.165\nThere's different ways you could do it.\n\n624\n00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:23.191\nBut ultimately, if we're saying,\nhey, only these servers, right,\n\n625\n00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:26.029\nfrom this range in this\narea can send through here,\n\n626\n00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:29.000\nwe could certainly use mail\nrelays to our advantage.\n\n627\n00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.313\nBut really what mail relays\nare doing is simply giving us\n\n628\n00:33:32.313 --> 00:33:36.331\nthe ability to send mail through\na system without having to set up and\n\n629\n00:33:36.331 --> 00:33:39.240\nmanage a fully functional\nemail architecture.\n\n630\n00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.470\nWe don't have to build an entire SMTP\nbased server system to be able to do this.\n\n631\n00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.690\nWe could deploy a limited\nfunctional system that really just\n\n632\n00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.000\naccepts mail in one respect.\n\n633\n00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.180\nAnd just is doing this, right, and\nsending it along to the next item down.\n\n634\n00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.600\nIt's like a router in the thought\nprocess of a hop, we're doing that, but\n\n635\n00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.200\nwe're doing that specific to mail.\n\n636\n00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.171\nSo it does give us capabilities, but\n\n637\n00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:03.108\nit may not necessarily prevent\nthis kind of behavior.\n\n638\n00:34:03.108 --> 00:34:04.527\nAs a matter of fact, as I said,\n\n639\n00:34:04.527 --> 00:34:08.368\nmost likely it actually enables this kind\nof behavior if it's set up incorrectly.\n\n640\n00:34:08.368 --> 00:34:09.753\nAnd so it's very difficult for\n\n641\n00:34:09.753 --> 00:34:13.420\nus to really deploy those effectively\nif we don't know what we're doing.\n\n642\n00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.630\nWe just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n643\n00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.618\nPhishing, standard class of attacks\nwe see today, or crimes we see today.\n\n644\n00:34:19.618 --> 00:34:23.600\nAs I just described, any number of emails\nyou get asking you to do something,\n\n645\n00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.480\ntricking you or enticing you or\nentrapping you into making bad decisions.\n\n646\n00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.308\nBecause somebody is dangling something in\nfront of you, trying to get you to click\n\n647\n00:34:31.308 --> 00:34:35.270\non them, that would be an example of\nphishing, spoofing, masquerading, right?\n\n648\n00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.536\nI'm pretending to be somebody.\n\n649\n00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:41.270\nHey, this is the IT support\ndesk here at ABC Megacorp.\n\n650\n00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.870\nPlease submit your usernames and\npasswords for audit verification.\n\n651\n00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.688\nYou'd be surprised how many times I get\nphone calls from customers about this\n\n652\n00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:48.810\nkinda stuff, right?\n\n653\n00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:51.924\nHey, did you guys send out or, hey,\nis it likely that our bank would do this?\n\n654\n00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:56.150\nOr is it likely that the bank sent this\nemail saying, we have to send this?\n\n655\n00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.720\nAbsolutely not, right?\n\n656\n00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.653\nRule of thumb, financial institutions do\nnot communicate with you via email with\n\n657\n00:35:01.653 --> 00:35:03.420\nregards to security related stuff.\n\n658\n00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.156\nThat's just a standing rule in the world\ntoday, because it is so easy to spoof and\n\n659\n00:35:08.156 --> 00:35:13.120\nto masquerade that traffic that it is just\ngonna lead to bad outcomes no matter what.\n\n660\n00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.080\nAnd most of them will\nhave standing policies.\n\n661\n00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.066\nThey will tell you unequivocally, hey,\n\n662\n00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:20.400\nwe'd never send you an email that\nsays we need your account info.\n\n663\n00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.250\nWe have your account info, there's no\nreason for you to tell it to us, right?\n\n664\n00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.400\nWe already know what it is.\n\n665\n00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.570\nYour doctors should not be communicating\nwith you via email asking for oersonally\n\n666\n00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.170\nidentifiable information, what we call\nhigh PII, P-I-I, with regards to you.\n\n667\n00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.727\nAnybody who does that in an open format,\nan email,\n\n668\n00:35:36.727 --> 00:35:38.812\nyou should look highly suspiciously on.\n\n669\n00:35:38.812 --> 00:35:43.115\nBecause there's absolutely no good\nreason from a security standpoint for\n\n670\n00:35:43.115 --> 00:35:44.352\nthat to be occuring.\n\n671\n00:35:44.352 --> 00:35:47.844\nI'm not suggesting that that doesn't mean\nthat over the web as you log in with\n\n672\n00:35:47.844 --> 00:35:48.650\na secure portal,\n\n673\n00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.730\nyou may not be asked to provide\ninformation to validate who you are.\n\n674\n00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:56.020\nIt's not the same thing as asking blindly\nthrough an email for you to submit that.\n\n675\n00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.690\nVery different,\nwantnao be clear about that, right?\n\n676\n00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.722\nBut in an email, no, absolutely not.\n\n677\n00:36:00.722 --> 00:36:05.025\nSo spoofing really happens cuz people just\ndon't think through the logic of the fact\n\n678\n00:36:05.025 --> 00:36:08.781\nthat it's probably somebody on the other\nside that's looking to get that\n\n679\n00:36:08.781 --> 00:36:10.738\ninformation under false pretenses.\n\n680\n00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:14.520\nAnd that's was a spoof or\na masquerade will often be.\n\n681\n00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.478\nSo we do see these kinds of email\ncrimes happening all the time.\n\n682\n00:36:18.478 --> 00:36:21.662\nJust wanted to finish up this particular\nepisodes talking about headers for\n\n683\n00:36:21.662 --> 00:36:22.615\njust another minute.\n\n684\n00:36:22.615 --> 00:36:26.365\nTalked about them, what you may find\nin them, detailed out the eight or\n\n685\n00:36:26.365 --> 00:36:28.740\nnine things you would\noften find to look for or\n\n686\n00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.460\nthat are of interest to\nyou in an email header.\n\n687\n00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.169\nThere's also this idea of\nwhat we call X-headers.\n\n688\n00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:35.549\nX-headers, capital X dash and then and\n\n689\n00:36:35.549 --> 00:36:38.699\nsome sort of thing that goes\non are additional items,\n\n690\n00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:43.620\nit's just a generic term that we use\nwith regards to headers in our industry.\n\n691\n00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.499\nThe capital X and\nthe hyphen with whatever comes after it,\n\n692\n00:36:46.499 --> 00:36:49.808\nrepresents the idea that we're\nproviding non-standard input.\n\n693\n00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:54.080\nWe're providing information,\nin other words, that may be descriptive,\n\n694\n00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.030\ndeclaratory, may be important just\nas additional filler material.\n\n695\n00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.218\nBut it's not gonna be part\nof the standard SMTP header.\n\n696\n00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:04.750\nNot part of the standard email packet,\nper se.\n\n697\n00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.106\nBut we can add it in,\nin order to validate or\n\n698\n00:37:07.106 --> 00:37:11.240\nadd additional information that somebody\nmay wanna put in as part of that.\n\n699\n00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.060\nSo, we call those things X-headers and\nwe'll often look at those forensically,\n\n700\n00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.710\nif they're available.\n\n701\n00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.330\nThey're not always.\n\n702\n00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.790\nBut we obviously look at the email packet,\n\n703\n00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:23.490\nthe email data, frame overall, we look at\nthe header in particular as I suggested.\n\n704\n00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.900\nAnd if we have additional\nextraneous material,\n\n705\n00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.050\nit is often referred to as these X-headers\nand that may have additional stuff in it.\n\n706\n00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.390\nIt may have specific\ninformation about point origin,\n\n707\n00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:37.110\nabout somebody who was doing\nsomething around the email.\n\n708\n00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.227\nPerhaps an additional security\nfeature that has been added in or\n\n709\n00:37:40.227 --> 00:37:43.530\na vendor's information,\nlots of things that could show up there.\n\n710\n00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.540\nWhatever it is,\nmay provide addition insight for us.\n\n711\n00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.960\nSo we just wanna make sure we're\naware of it, we're thinking about it.\n\n712\n00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.340\nAnd certainly, we have a sense in our\nminds that would be good if we trip across\n\n713\n00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.100\nthis stuff to document it, just like\nwe've talked about with everything else.\n\n714\n00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.818\nAnd then we have an accurate\nrecord of what was in that email.\n\n715\n00:37:57.818 --> 00:38:01.324\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, I think we've\nstarted on the edges of our puzzle here.\n\n716\n00:38:01.324 --> 00:38:03.580\nWe're starting to organize\nall the little colors, but\n\n717\n00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.170\nwe have a lot of little pieces to cover.\n\n718\n00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.670\nSo if you could stay with us for\nthe next episode, that'd be great.\n\n719\n00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.270\nBut for this show, we are out of time.\n\n720\n00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.720\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n721\n00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.570\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n722\n00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:14.552\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n723\n00:38:14.552 --> 00:38:15.950\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.372\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:11.517\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:13.800\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to CHFI version 9.\n\n6\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.690\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.670\nJust as promised from the last episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.570\nwe will continue to speak about\ndifferent types of email components and\n\n9\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.730\nhow they can be helpful during\nour forensic investigation.\n\n10\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.707\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordone.\n\n11\n00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:30.535\nHow are you today, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:31.485\n&gt;&gt; I am well.\n\n13\n00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.275\nI'm well.\nHopefully you are also.\n\n14\n00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.245\nLooking forward to spending some more\ntime talking about investigating email\n\n15\n00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.575\nattacks and\nforensically how we do so with you.\n\n16\n00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.395\nWe talked on our last episode\nabout a lot of things laid down\n\n17\n00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.025\nsome of the groundwork or\nthe foundation elements around.\n\n18\n00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.445\nWhat emails systems look like,\n\n19\n00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.933\nclient server model, what kind of protocol\nsupports are involved, the SMTP, POP3,\n\n20\n00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:56.200\nIMF4 talked a bit about the concepts of\nthe email header, what we may find there.\n\n21\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.690\nWhy they are valuable to us and\nwhy we would want to investigate those.\n\n22\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.420\nBut we have to talked about the steps\ninvolved with actually investigation email\n\n23\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.340\ncrimes and violations.\n\n24\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.080\nWe actually laid out what email crime\ncategories, common ones are as well.\n\n25\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.800\nBut there is a methodology involved here.\n\n26\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.140\nWe wanna make sure we\nare familiar with that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.940\nGive me just one second,\nI wanna bring that up for you.\n\n28\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.590\nLet me just get to my little handy\nstep-by-step breakdown here.\n\n29\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.950\nIf we could take a look\nat my machine here for\n\n30\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.150\njust a minute, since steps involved\nwith investigating an email crime.\n\n31\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.970\nWe have an eight-point methodology\nthat you can see here.\n\n32\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.130\nWe always start out by getting\npermission as we've talked about before,\n\n33\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.260\nwhether it's through\nobtaining a search warrant.\n\n34\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.810\nA lot of times that will be\nthe case if we are operating\n\n35\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.860\nfrom outside the organization, so\nlaw enforcement officials will do this.\n\n36\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.840\nBut keep in mind and we've made this point\nseveral times in earlier episodes around\n\n37\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.378\nthe methodology of incident response and\nthe investigative methodology overall.\n\n38\n00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:51.090\nThat that multi-layered\nthought process may involve\n\n39\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.370\ninternal administrative investigations\nthat don't require a search warrant, but\n\n40\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.300\ndo require the authority or\nthe approval of somebody that can say yes,\n\n41\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.980\ndefinitively, I'm in charge, I give you\npermission to go look at that computer.\n\n42\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.060\nGo open that door and find out what's\nin that desk that kind of thing.\n\n43\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.470\nSo, it maybe an internal function inside\nthe business if we're doing incident\n\n44\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.580\nresponse and forensic investigation for\nan internal incident for a company.\n\n45\n00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.360\nWhere part of a managed incident\nresponse team or if it's an external law\n\n46\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.340\nenforcement function, then search\nwarrants would be the order of the day.\n\n47\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.610\nSo, just be aware of that but\nexamine email messages.\n\n48\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.170\nSo we want to start going in, once we have\nthe legal requirements out of the way,\n\n49\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.210\nand the permission and the validation,\nto go search for certain things.\n\n50\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.780\nWe then want to start\ngathering them up and\n\n51\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.610\nexamining them, copying and printing\nwhatever may be of interest there.\n\n52\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.130\nView email headers, we talked about\nthat and the significance of that.\n\n53\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.970\nAnalyzing what's in the email headers.\n\n54\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.180\nRemember, viewing is not\nthe same thing as analyzing.\n\n55\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.110\nWe do distinguish and\nbreak down between these two activities,\n\n56\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.190\nbecause viewing is just,\nyou're in the first pass.\n\n57\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.485\nHey, let's look at what's there.\n\n58\n00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:58.150\nWell, that's kind of interesting and\nlooks like it was sent from this IP and\n\n59\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.180\nsent over to this machine.\n\n60\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.500\nNow let's actually go in there and\nanalyze and really see what's going on.\n\n61\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.950\nNow we just have a sense.\n\n62\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.342\nSo the first one step for reviewing,\nit's almost like our first pass,\n\n63\n00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:12.720\na quick read through whereas step five\nanalyzing is more detailed thorough and\n\n64\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.190\nthoughtful thought process about really\ndissecting and internalizing and\n\n65\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.780\nunderstanding and analyzing what is there.\n\n66\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.850\nTrace the email.\n\n67\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.520\nWalk it back through\nthe chain of transmission.\n\n68\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.250\nBetter understand where it came from.\n\n69\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.240\nWhat systems touched it along the way.\n\n70\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.100\nDid we got through relays as Cherokee\nwas asking about on the last episode?\n\n71\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.320\nIf they are there, to what end?\n\n72\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.230\nWere there anonymizers used?\n\n73\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.330\nWere we sending this from an open\npublic system, a closed private system?\n\n74\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.020\nThere's a lot of stuff we'd want to know.\n\n75\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.380\nand really better understand.\n\n76\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.630\nEnquire email archived.\n\n77\n00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.670\nThese would be the locally available\ncopies on a client, perhaps the server\n\n78\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.040\nbased archives as well, depending on\nthe type of email system we have.\n\n79\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.310\nRemember between SMTP POP and\nIMap, we may or\n\n80\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.800\nmay not have stuff stored on the server.\n\n81\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.980\nMay or may not have stuff stored locally,\nmay have it in both places.\n\n82\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.340\nMay not have it in both places.\n\n83\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.300\nWe have to understand that and\nexamine email logs.\n\n84\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.850\nWe want to understand better and\nhave complete picture representation of\n\n85\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.900\nwhat kind of email went through the system\nunder what conditions, from who to where,\n\n86\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.980\nat what time to what end, for\nwhat reasons with what attachments.\n\n87\n00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.620\nThe list goes on and on when you think\nabout the questions we would like to\n\n88\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.920\nanswer and logs help us to do a lot\nof those things pretty quick.\n\n89\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.680\nBecause they give us at\nleast on the surface anyway,\n\n90\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.530\nwe have to validate the integrity\nof the logs validate\n\n91\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.280\nthe information that is there to ensure\nthat they have not been modified.\n\n92\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.460\nWe do and\nwe have talked about in prior discussion,\n\n93\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.260\nthe fact that we have tools\nthat can modify log files.\n\n94\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.710\nWe know we have methodologies on\nthe hacker side that specifically,\n\n95\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.330\nin the anti-forensics\nconversations we had.\n\n96\n00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.130\nEarly on in some of those episodes\nabout defeating anti-forensic and\n\n97\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.140\nunderstanding the anti-forensics\ntool sets and mind sets, essentially\n\n98\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.610\nthinking like the hacker, which is\nwhat I talked about in those episodes.\n\n99\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.250\nAnd understanding how to do that, we\ntalked about the fact that we can modify\n\n100\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.970\nlog files and\nwe have tools that will do that.\n\n101\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.160\nAnd we can always and\nmust always look at logs and\n\n102\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.280\nunderstand there's a lot of\nvaluable information there.\n\n103\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.550\nWe have to look at them with\na slightly jaundiced eye.\n\n104\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.270\nA little bit of a standoff\nthought process in our mind.\n\n105\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.320\nIs that an accurate representation?\n\n106\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.810\nIs that log legitimate?\n\n107\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.490\nHas it been modified?\n\n108\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.350\nDo we forensically have\nthe ability to tell, and\n\n109\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.400\nif so, have we done our due diligence and\nexercised our due care?\n\n110\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.710\nTwo terms that we often talk about, and\nyou've heard me talk about in prior\n\n111\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.100\nepisodes, the oversight, and\nthe following of standardized process,\n\n112\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.870\nprocedure, and policy to drill through and\nbe methodical.\n\n113\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.520\nAnd the validation of verification\nactivities around ensuring that to\n\n114\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.680\nthe best of our knowledge, the best of\nour abilities, that the information we\n\n115\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.230\nprovide, the analysis we provide, the\nsummary reports and detailed information\n\n116\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.040\nthat we present as investigators,\nis as accurate as it can be.\n\n117\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.810\nAnd if we are not taking those steps and\nengaging in those methodological\n\n118\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.070\nactivities, we're not doing our job or\nwe're not doing it the right way.\n\n119\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.060\nSo we do have to make sure we gather all\nthe different points of information, but\n\n120\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.520\nwe just have to be a little bit skeptical.\n\n121\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.480\nHey, could it be that\nsomebody got in there,\n\n122\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.310\ncould it be that somebody modified that?\n\n123\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.890\nHow would I tell and have I done the test?\n\n124\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.760\nThe litmus test or have I walked\nthrough the logic to eliminate or\n\n125\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.620\nto validate the possibility one way or\nthe other.\n\n126\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.768\nVery important for us to be thinking about\nthat at all times under all conditions.\n\n127\n00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:18.371\nYes?\n\n128\n00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:21.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nothing.\n\n129\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.790\nI'm just sitting here\nthinking a lot of times,\n\n130\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.860\nlike you had mentioned,\nthinking as an attacker can really help.\n\n131\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.130\nAnd you've even seen historically where\nsome of those Black hatters maybe\n\n132\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.010\nthey've kind of shifted into some\nkind of debugging process to help and\n\n133\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.970\nflip the tables at some point, because\nthey can be beneficial in that way.\n\n134\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Do they know you're\ncalling them Black hatters?\n\n135\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.390\nIs that something you've\nchecked with them about, or\n\n136\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.810\nis that just a Cherokee-ism\nthat you've come up with?\n\n137\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.978\n&gt;&gt; I very seriously doubt that they\ncare that much to monitor me and\n\n138\n00:06:46.978 --> 00:06:47.963\nmy boring life.\n\n139\n00:06:47.963 --> 00:06:49.442\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just wondered,\n\n140\n00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:52.120\njust,not a term I've heard before so\nI was just wondering.\n\n141\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.670\nEvery time without exception\nwhen I spend time with Cherokee,\n\n142\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.550\nI do, all kidding aside I\ndo learn something new.\n\n143\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.510\nAnd it's always important for\nus to pay attention to those things.\n\n144\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.960\nEspecially things like as\ncolorful as Black hatters?\n\n145\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.250\nI was remembering the Chartreuse and a -.\n\n146\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n[LAUGH] We love colors guys.\n\n147\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.820\n&gt;&gt; Conversations we had\nfrom shows gone by.\n\n148\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.000\nI was actually replaying that recently.\n\n149\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.350\nSomebody asked, hey what do you\ndo when you go up to IT ProTV?\n\n150\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.595\nAnd when you spend time up there you sound\nlike you do all this really cool stuff.\n\n151\n00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:19.770\nCan you explain to me more or\nless what you're doing.\n\n152\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.285\nI said have I got an episode for you.\n\n153\n00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:22.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n154\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.755\nI said I actually showed them\nthat episode and they got it.\n\n155\n00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:27.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they understood it, so.\n\n156\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.660\nVery colorful when Cherokee and\nI spend time together.\n\n157\n00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.730\nAlways a lot of fun.\n\n158\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.188\nAll right, so, continue our conversation,\n\n159\n00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:37.410\none of things that actually\nwe should be thinking about.\n\n160\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.628\nAnd you actually brought up a really\ninteresting point with the black hatter,\n\n161\n00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.430\na hatterers reference.\n\n162\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A moment ago.\n\n163\n00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:46.665\nSo, we'll think about out\npotential people that are hacking,\n\n164\n00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:48.445\nthat are attacking a lot of times.\n\n165\n00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:52.025\nWe just say hey, their out they're\nhacking, they're doing this or that.\n\n166\n00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:54.442\nAnd yes,\nit's a very broad category of operation.\n\n167\n00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:56.647\nBut let's be a little bit more\nnarrowly define for moment,\n\n168\n00:07:56.647 --> 00:07:59.750\nlet's say they are up into no good, but\nmaybe there's spoofing or masquerading.\n\n169\n00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.512\nMaybe they are, those people whoever\nthey are, are hiding in the shadows, but\n\n170\n00:08:03.512 --> 00:08:06.603\nthey are trying to purport or\nrepresent themselves as somebody or\n\n171\n00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:07.860\nsomething they're not.\n\n172\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.620\nAs a forensic investigator,\nit would be our job to uncover that.\n\n173\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.954\nAn average user may not realize,\nas we talked about in a prior episode,\n\n174\n00:08:14.954 --> 00:08:18.416\nthat that email is coming from a place\nwhere it is not legitimate, right?\n\n175\n00:08:18.416 --> 00:08:21.894\nWe just don't know that our\nbank didn't send that email and\n\n176\n00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:24.550\nwe followed through and\nclicked on the link.\n\n177\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.051\nSo now we have an issue and\nnow we have to come in and investigate.\n\n178\n00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:31.588\nSo, as a result, we're now looking\nat this, let's say hypothetically,\n\n179\n00:08:31.588 --> 00:08:33.467\nhow are we gonna walk back,\nhow are we gonna trace back?\n\n180\n00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:35.403\nWell, one of the ways we can do that,\n\n181\n00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:38.150\nif you join me over here\nis gonna be a set of tools.\n\n182\n00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.080\nI love tools that are available online.\n\n183\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.030\nYou've heard me talk about this before.\n\n184\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.170\nI love tools that you have to download and\nuse and pay for, both are good.\n\n185\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.200\nBut if we could use something online and\nwe have access to it and\n\n186\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.170\nit works well, then, that's just another\ntool that we can put into our tool kit,\n\n187\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.875\nanother approach for us to have.\n\n188\n00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:56.050\nAre you gonna have access to Internet and\n\n189\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.642\nsecure communication pathways while\non site investigating incident?\n\n190\n00:08:59.642 --> 00:09:02.155\nWe've talked extensively in prior\ndiscussions about the fact,\n\n191\n00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:03.980\nyou should not rely on that.\n\n192\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.270\nIt should be an assumption\nthat it's not secure.\n\n193\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.505\nBut from a forensics lab where you've\ntaken the steps and spent the time and\n\n194\n00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:14.620\nenergy to set up secure communications,\ncan you do this kind of work?\n\n195\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.755\nAbsolutely, could you control the Internet\nconnection by having your own network\n\n196\n00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:20.550\non-site while your on site investigating?\n\n197\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.610\nYeah you could, I'm not saying its\nnot possible today with wireless\n\n198\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.020\nhotspot technology.\n\n199\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.120\nYou could spin up a secure network and\nover the Internet, through tunneling and\n\n200\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.820\nthrough encryption,\nuse secure communication channels.\n\n201\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.430\nI'm not suggesting you\nshouldn't look at the Internet.\n\n202\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.180\nAs a mechanism and a validation point for\ntools, quite the opposite,\n\n203\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.220\nI think you should.\n\n204\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.210\nBut I'm just suggesting that,\nif you're access,\n\n205\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.310\nyour on ramp to the Internet is, I'll plug\ninto the same network I'm investigating,\n\n206\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.240\nright, then probably not a good idea.\n\n207\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.660\nIf your access, your on ramp is,\nI have a secure secondary\n\n208\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.410\ncommunication channel that I control, then\nthat's probably a much better approach.\n\n209\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.605\nSo, a site like this, centralops.net,\none of the many sites out there,\n\n210\n00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:02.390\nthis allows check to validity\nof an email sender, right?\n\n211\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.912\nAmong many things we can do,\nyou can go in.\n\n212\n00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:08.639\nYou'll see we have the investigation or\nthe ability to do essentially a who is\n\n213\n00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:11.870\nlook up and look at things like\ndomain names and IP addresses.\n\n214\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.300\nWe can do domain checks.\n\n215\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.580\nWe can validate and\ntroubleshoot email addresses.\n\n216\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.690\nThey have that capability here.\n\n217\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.020\nIt's what we're kind of\ntalking about right now.\n\n218\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.650\nI'll bet you can do things like pinging,\n\n219\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.730\nyou could see you know what your browser\nviews about you, browser mirroring,\n\n220\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.470\nit does a validation check and\na best practice check against things.\n\n221\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.510\nTrace route, MS lookup, tool that\nCherokee loves to spend time with, right?\n\n222\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.930\nSo DNS lookups, stuff like that,\ncould be done through here.\n\n223\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:40.150\nAutoWhois, TCP query, analyze path,\nthis is a graphical trace route.\n\n224\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.970\nThese are really cool tools cuz they\ngive us a lot of information, and\n\n225\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.690\nthey help up to better understand things.\n\n226\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.960\nSo if we go, for instance, and\nlook at the email dossier.\n\n227\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.250\nEmail address, right, so\nyou have to test this.\n\n228\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.830\nSo let's say that we'd go in and we test,\nyou wanna be the test subject here.\n\n229\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n230\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.770\n&gt;&gt; I'll do mine so\nlet's do adam@itpro.tv cuz you sounded so\n\n231\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.500\nenthusiastic about that when I asked.\n\n232\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.656\nYou were like, not again.\n\n233\n00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:07.626\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking, definitely, I'm only\ngoing to be using my work email address\n\n234\n00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:09.780\nhere, so-\n&gt;&gt; Not again, every time.\n\n235\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.980\nI'm the one who always has\nto jump on that grenade.\n\n236\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.250\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n237\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.830\nWe'll go full screen, just so\nyou can see what I'm doing,\n\n238\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.010\nit'll be a little easier for you.\n\n239\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.782\nSo I'm just typing in my IT Pro TV\nemail address, no surprise, right?\n\n240\n00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:23.712\nadam@ itpro.tv, except that my real\nname is not Adam, it's George.\n\n241\n00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:25.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, that's not me, all right.\n\n242\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.520\nSo, adam@itpro.tv, we're gonna click\nGo here, give this just a second.\n\n243\n00:11:33.935 --> 00:11:35.020\nThere we go, all right.\n\n244\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.010\nSo validating the results, it takes\n30 secs, it doesn't take very long.\n\n245\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.610\nSo you'll see it is pretty confident,\nin terms of confidence rating that we're\n\n246\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.950\nusing an SMTP-based, or backed email\nserver, and indeed we are, right?\n\n247\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.170\nAs are many systems in the world.\n\n248\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.190\nSo the email address passed this\nlevel of validation without an error.\n\n249\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.830\nHowever, it's not guaranteed\nto be a good address.\n\n250\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.710\nMeaning, yes, it seems like it's valid.\n\n251\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.960\nWe can query the SMTP server.\n\n252\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.020\nWe could resolve ITPro.tv so\nwe can find it's a valid email domain for\n\n253\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.210\nsending and receiving.\n\n254\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.486\nWe could see an MX record out there,\nright?\n\n255\n00:12:06.486 --> 00:12:10.240\nOutlook.com, no surprise,\nwe're using Office 365.\n\n256\n00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.970\nThat's public record,\npublic knowledge information.\n\n257\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.450\nKind of thing, nothing here that in anyway\nis going to get anybody in trouble or\n\n258\n00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.120\ngonna be hard to find if you just go out\nand check anybody's email address, right?\n\n259\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.160\nSo we could see that, so we see that.\n\n260\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.580\nWe could see the SMTP session\ninformation for ITProTV mail and\n\n261\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.420\njust see some general\ninformation about it.\n\n262\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.920\nFor instance, when we were talking\nabout using SMTP, we could see\n\n263\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.960\ninformation like how we initialize\nthe connection, what day and\n\n264\n00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.010\ntime we initialized the connection at, so\nwe could see that information right there.\n\n265\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.330\nWe can see the extended HLR or\nextended hello command,\n\n266\n00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.250\nso ESMTP and\nSMTP commands are being supported.\n\n267\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.690\nGood piece of information for\nus to be aware of.\n\n268\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.220\nAnd to know and\nwe're seeing a general exchange, right?\n\n269\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.260\nRecipients, so you can see here,\nmail from, it's just a generic send.\n\n270\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.770\nWrite sender okay,\nrecipient to and recipient okay.\n\n271\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.650\nRight down here, this part right here,\nvalidates the fact\n\n272\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.730\nthat I'm a legitimate user on that system\nthat my email address, in theory, should\n\n273\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.970\nbe good, and it's not bouncing, which\nmeans it's probably a live email address.\n\n274\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.870\nAnd in theory, you could send email to it.\n\n275\n00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.270\nYou ever wonder a spam box?\n\n276\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.080\nFigure out how to just blow all sorts of\nemail into the corporate environment?\n\n277\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.500\nA lot of it is just, hey we're gonna take\nevery email address that we can find.\n\n278\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.730\nBut a lot of times they're running scripts\nbehind the scenes that are probing and\n\n279\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.570\nvalidating email addresses to narrowly\ndefine which ones are live, so\n\n280\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.540\nthat they don't get nailed as easily for\nbeing spammers.\n\n281\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.180\nAnd this is one of the ways you do this,\njust by querying the mail servers,\n\n282\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.510\nso a little bit of hacking, as well as\na little bit of forensic investigation.\n\n283\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.710\nKind of one on one here, so, we could\ndo something like this very easily.\n\n284\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.240\nNow, this in and\n\n285\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.130\nof itself doesn't really tell us much, but\nit tells us that the email is valid and\n\n286\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.610\ngives us some general information\nabout the email system.\n\n287\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.750\nFrom a forensic standpoint, would\nsomething like that be another piece of\n\n288\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.620\ninformation, a little piece of\nthe mosaic that we're building?\n\n289\n00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.500\nYeah, I wanna know\nthe email system is valid,\n\n290\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.040\nI wanna know some information about it.\n\n291\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.560\nWhat kind of email system is it?\n\n292\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.730\nWhere is it located?\n\n293\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.280\nThose are things that would be helpful,\nright?\n\n294\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.050\nAnd so doing that kind of\nlookup would be valuable,\n\n295\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.870\nit would give us some good information.\n\n296\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.010\nAnd so, as a forensic investigator,\nI wanna be able to use tools like this\n\n297\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:26.010\nbecause I wanna be able to understand the\nlogic, the architecture, the system, and\n\n298\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.650\nthe blueprint or the route, right?\n\n299\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.790\nThe map of how information moves, in this\ncase, how email is moving back and forth.\n\n300\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.030\nSo a tool like this, very simple,\neasily accessible online,\n\n301\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.130\ncould actually be very valuable for\nus, right, just as a way to do that.\n\n302\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.810\nAnd there's other tools here as well,\nby the way.\n\n303\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.440\nWe may look at something like\nanalyzing a path, right?\n\n304\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.720\nThis is just that graphical trace route\nthat gives us some information, right?\n\n305\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.830\nSo if we did something like,\nwe have to have an IP address.\n\n306\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.800\nSo let's do something here really quickly.\n\n307\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.914\nLet's go out and let's ping www.,\nI don't know, where do you wanna go today?\n\n308\n00:15:02.914 --> 00:15:04.245\n&gt;&gt; Zappos.com.\n\n309\n00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:05.497\n&gt;&gt; Zappos.com?\n\n310\n00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:06.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:15:06.264 --> 00:15:08.730\n&gt;&gt; Is that Z-A-P-P-O-S?\n\n312\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.560\n&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.\n\n313\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.511\nAll right, so\nZappos is gonna be 23.78.138.155, right?\n\n314\n00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.997\nSo we did something like this.\n\n315\n00:15:18.997 --> 00:15:24.500\nLet's just pull this over here so\nI can see this and enter it in real time.\n\n316\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.537\nJust to show you what this does, right?\n\n317\n00:15:25.537 --> 00:15:28.941\nSo if we do\n\n318\n00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:38.941\n23.78.138.155.\n\n319\n00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:42.200\nSo let's just give this a second.\n\n320\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.940\nIt doesn't take very long typically.\n\n321\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.400\nWhat we're doing is just the trace track.\n\n322\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.110\nWe're going out on hoping point to point\nfrom where we started out the ITPRO.TV\n\n323\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.300\nstudios here in sunny Burbank, Florida.\n\n324\n00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.500\nAnd we are, that was a joke,\nyou didn't get that.\n\n325\n00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, Burbank what?\n\n326\n00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.330\nDid they actually list that,\nor is just a joke.\n\n327\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.236\n&gt;&gt; Burbank, California.\n\n328\n00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:01.221\nThat's where most of\nthe TV production is done.\n\n329\n00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:04.098\nAll right, we're not going to\nmake any side jokes for Cherokee,\n\n330\n00:16:04.098 --> 00:16:05.838\ncuz she's just not paying attention.\n\n331\n00:16:05.838 --> 00:16:08.992\nSo starting out at the ITProTV\nstudio here, right?\n\n332\n00:16:08.992 --> 00:16:11.072\nAnd then hopping through\nall the connections,\n\n333\n00:16:11.072 --> 00:16:13.516\nintermediate connections all\nthe way out to wherever,\n\n334\n00:16:13.516 --> 00:16:16.510\nI don't have any idea where's\napple.com website actually is.\n\n335\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.140\nBut we're gonna go out there, it's a guest\nhexelian.com whatever that is, and\n\n336\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.520\nso we're going through here and\nwe are winding up.\n\n337\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:31.214\nYou could see we went through four or\nfive different hops and wind up down here.\n\n338\n00:16:31.214 --> 00:16:35.036\nAnd so we're just getting a representation\nof the connection points, right?\n\n339\n00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:39.196\nA trace route is nothing more than a let\nme look step by step at every path as\n\n340\n00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:40.720\nsupposed to appendages.\n\n341\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.780\nLet me start here.\n\n342\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.005\nLet me mask all the information\nin the middle and\n\n343\n00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:47.396\njust return information from the end\npoint, and show you four times that\n\n344\n00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:50.135\nyou hit it without telling you\nabout anything in between.\n\n345\n00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.373\nBoth very valuable,\n\n346\n00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:55.510\nbut the trace route gives us more\ndetailed information along the path.\n\n347\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.748\nEvery path, every hop, is actually\ngonna be documented and we can see it.\n\n348\n00:16:58.748 --> 00:17:02.778\nAnd so it produces that for us and gives\nus some information about where we wind\n\n349\n00:17:02.778 --> 00:17:06.380\nup, we are hosting, or this one is\nhosted at Alchemy Technologies.\n\n350\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.150\nSo it's probably hosted in\na main data center somewhere.\n\n351\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.150\nHard to say where, but I could probably\nresolve that and figure that out.\n\n352\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.730\nI'm just looking if Atlanta, right, so\n\n353\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.820\nit's probably in Atlanta somewhere,\nthe item.\n\n354\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.080\nI know it's kinda hard to see,\n\n355\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.200\nbut right above where the final hop\nis we see that they're in Atlanta.\n\n356\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.650\nThe several hops before,\nactually, I'll show Atlanta.\n\n357\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.335\nAnd so as a result,\n\n358\n00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:30.670\nthere;s probably a data center where the\nweb hosting is being done somewhere there.\n\n359\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.820\nAnd that's what we're seeing, so\n\n360\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.040\nwe can, again as a forensic investigator,\nzero in on some of this information.\n\n361\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.705\nDoes knowing that,\nthat site's in Atlanta help us?\n\n362\n00:17:38.705 --> 00:17:39.615\nProbably not.\n\n363\n00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:42.495\nNot in this case, and\nwe're really not interested in it per se.\n\n364\n00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:44.415\nBut in the real world,\nif we were investigating,\n\n365\n00:17:44.415 --> 00:17:45.345\nwould it be good to know that?\n\n366\n00:17:45.345 --> 00:17:47.165\nIt may actually be good to know.\n\n367\n00:17:47.165 --> 00:17:50.825\nWe could then start to peel back\nsome of the layers around that and\n\n368\n00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:52.865\nunderstand information.\n\n369\n00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:56.175\nSo you're using some of these tools\ncan actually be very valuable,\n\n370\n00:17:56.175 --> 00:18:00.345\nvery helpful for us, both with regards to\nemail investigation and even more broadly.\n\n371\n00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.300\nAnd we've talked about\nthese in some other areas.\n\n372\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.745\nIn other shows that we've done.\n\n373\n00:18:03.745 --> 00:18:07.460\nAnd for instance, the forensics\naround an operating system and\n\n374\n00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.230\nremotely accessing it to understand\nwhat's going on with it.\n\n375\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.150\nAnd looking at things like\nlog files on both local and\n\n376\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.730\nremote systems in upcoming\nconversation about mobile forensics.\n\n377\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.742\nWhere was that device when we\nwere trying to interact with it.\n\n378\n00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:23.835\nStill looking at the cell towers and\nlooking at all of the moving parts and\n\n379\n00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:28.196\npieces in a cell network to understand\nwhat kind of information we can get from\n\n380\n00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:32.380\na GPS trilocation, coordination,\nthe information services.\n\n381\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.518\nThat kind of stuff is helpful,\nwe just apply it in different avenues,\n\n382\n00:18:35.518 --> 00:18:37.389\ndifferent venues for different reason.\n\n383\n00:18:37.389 --> 00:18:41.500\n&gt;&gt; You may even hear it called\nthe looking glass site at times.\n\n384\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.440\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes refers to a little bit\nbroader concept than just this.\n\n385\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.580\nBut you could hear it sometimes\nrefer to that way as well.\n\n386\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.860\nIt's not unusual, absolutely.\n\n387\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.675\nSo just a way in which we can use\ntools in real-time to start to begin\n\n388\n00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.340\nshipping away to some of that, right?\n\n389\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.830\nCould we look at email headers using tools\non physically installed applications?\n\n390\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.853\nAbsolutely, we'll have a little show and\ntell at some point about that, and\n\n391\n00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:04.656\ntake a look at that.\n\n392\n00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:08.071\nBut there are ways we could do those\nthings and set that kind of stuff up, so\n\n393\n00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:09.630\njust keeping that in mind.\n\n394\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.636\nBut we also have to think about what kind\nof information is actually in the email,\n\n395\n00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:14.243\nin terms of the way it's encoded, right?\n\n396\n00:19:14.243 --> 00:19:17.812\nWe will chat a little bit before we get\nstarted with this episode about encoding,\n\n397\n00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:19.596\nand just different kinds of encoding and\n\n398\n00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:22.740\nthere's lots of different encoding\nthat takes place for email.\n\n399\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.135\nHow we translate characters and\nmake them available.\n\n400\n00:19:25.135 --> 00:19:29.068\nMIME, Multi-Purpose Internet Mail\nExtensions are traditionally used as desk\n\n401\n00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:30.120\nMIME or secure MIME.\n\n402\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.100\nOr just the idea of being able to send and\n\n403\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.293\nreceive securely using cryptography\nis pretty common today.\n\n404\n00:19:35.293 --> 00:19:38.057\nWe use MIME for sending and\nreceiving mail all the time, and\n\n405\n00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:41.924\nit extends the formatting around email to\nallow us to do things both traditional and\n\n406\n00:19:41.924 --> 00:19:42.933\nnon-traditional.\n\n407\n00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:45.730\nTo use ASCII as well as\nnon ASCII character sets,\n\n408\n00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.075\nattachments are available to us and\nbe able to used because\n\n409\n00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:53.770\nof multiple part message bodies where\nwe can have different things going on.\n\n410\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.560\nBelieve it or\nnot as part of the MIME standard.\n\n411\n00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.000\nSo a lot of times people don't think\nabout this they just take it for granted.\n\n412\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.209\nWe say, yeah and by the way hey we get\na zip five attachments on there and\n\n413\n00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:04.433\nbreak the email up into five different\nsteps, and do different things.\n\n414\n00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:05.999\nWe just take that for granted, but\n\n415\n00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:08.645\nthat's all part of what actually\nMIME is able to do for us.\n\n416\n00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:12.275\nSo both in the body and the header,\nright, we seethat kind of stuff so\n\n417\n00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:13.985\nwanna ll be thinking about that.\n\n418\n00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:17.607\nUUN code commonly none as\nUnix to Unix sim coding or\n\n419\n00:20:17.607 --> 00:20:19.987\nthat's what it's normally\nformally referred to.\n\n420\n00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:23.717\nUUN code is simply just the shorthand for\nthat, but UUN code is\n\n421\n00:20:23.717 --> 00:20:28.548\na utility that's used to encode and decode\nfiles shared on and between Unix systems.\n\n422\n00:20:28.548 --> 00:20:29.868\nSo it's been around forever and a day,\n\n423\n00:20:29.868 --> 00:20:34.218\nbecause Linus exception predates most\nof what we do here on the Windows side,\n\n424\n00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:36.988\nand in many of the other modern\noperating systems, as well.\n\n425\n00:20:36.988 --> 00:20:40.158\nRemember it as a great grandfather\nof just about every operating system\n\n426\n00:20:40.158 --> 00:20:44.000\non the planet, Linux directly\ntraces that lineage back to Unix\n\n427\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.740\nas does many of the operating\nsystems we use today.\n\n428\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.890\nSo we do have UUN encoding\nnot just in Unix, but\n\n429\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.960\nwe see it in many other\noperating systems as well.\n\n430\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.797\nEmail applications offer it as\nan alternate encoding method.\n\n431\n00:20:54.797 --> 00:20:57.762\nSo if we're not supporting\ntraditional character sets,\n\n432\n00:20:57.762 --> 00:21:02.056\nwe can fall back on UUN code to be able to\nsend, for email attachments in particular,\n\n433\n00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:04.490\nso we could send it to\na variety of mail systems.\n\n434\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.310\nSo just wanna be aware of that.\n\n435\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.620\nBinHex, binary to hexidecimal.\n\n436\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.440\nI know you're always excited about\nbinary and hex conversions and\n\n437\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.320\nthe whole thought process there.\n\n438\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.270\nBut it's a binary to text coding system,\nthat's what BinHex is, it's on the macOS.\n\n439\n00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.360\nSo those of you using\nthe Mac are using this.\n\n440\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.700\nYou send binary files via email\nby being able to use BinHex.\n\n441\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.244\nSo it's very similar to UUN code,\n\n442\n00:21:25.244 --> 00:21:29.360\nexcept it's a Macintosh derivative of UUN\ncode if you wanna think of it that way.\n\n443\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.130\nExtends and provides for\nfile information from the macOS.\n\n444\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.520\nSo it's different ways of\nthinking through encoding there,\n\n445\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.900\nwe also wanna think about examining these\nlog files we've referred to you before.\n\n446\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.410\nBoth on the Linux and\n\n447\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.220\nUnix based mail systems, we'll just kinda\nlump them together as one thought process.\n\n448\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.120\nAnd on the Microsoft side,\nbecause those are related to\n\n449\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.780\ntraditional large scaling of\nsystems we see more and more, and\n\n450\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.920\nreally it wanna be in one of the others\nwho are sending and receiving mails.\n\n451\n00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.912\nSo I wanna just to be thinking about\nthat and how that's gonna happen.\n\n452\n00:21:57.912 --> 00:22:02.640\nSo when we think about extending our\nexamination capabilities into logs and\n\n453\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.305\nlog systems.\n\n454\n00:22:03.305 --> 00:22:06.720\nWe're thinking about it on the server side\ntraditionally more so that the client.\n\n455\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.280\nAgain, it's not that we don't have\nlogs that are valuable on the client.\n\n456\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.240\nBut keep in mind, the majority of\nthe information about email systems\n\n457\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.290\nthat we wanna see as investigators from\na log prospective will be at the servers.\n\n458\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.030\nMeaning, the provider who owns that email\nsystem is really gonna have to step up and\n\n459\n00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.790\nwork with us.\n\n460\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.600\nWe're gonna have access to them, this is\nwhy search warrants become important.\n\n461\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.260\nBecause unless it's a corporate-owned\nasset that the head of the corporate\n\n462\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.950\nentity, or\nthe head of the security team, or\n\n463\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.890\nincident response, or whatever,\nworking internally has direct access to.\n\n464\n00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.160\nWe're talking about a third party system\nthat, while it may contain information\n\n465\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.390\npertinent to our investigation,\nis not owned by the company, or by us, and\n\n466\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.730\nis owned by a separate entity and\nis a multi-tenant system.\n\n467\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.790\nMost likely has hundreds, thousands\nof individuals being able to send and\n\n468\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.150\nreceive email through.\n\n469\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.428\nAnd we have no right to go poking around\nin there looking at other people's stuff,\n\n470\n00:22:57.428 --> 00:22:59.361\nunless we have a legal right to do so.\n\n471\n00:22:59.361 --> 00:23:02.191\nAnd a search warrant is how we\nestablish that legal right,\n\n472\n00:23:02.191 --> 00:23:05.350\nwith an e-discovery order\ntraditionally more often or not.\n\n473\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.450\nEspecially if it's cloud-based today,\nwhere we have the right\n\n474\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.130\nbased on information and presentation\nof information before a court.\n\n475\n00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.780\nAnd a judge signing off on that to be\ngiving us very specific set of operating\n\n476\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.540\nor marching instructions.\n\n477\n00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.260\nGo to this server and\nyou're able to see this, this and this.\n\n478\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.510\nYou could look for this information\nin this time-frame, pertaining to\n\n479\n00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.250\nthese particular customers or individuals,\nhowever you wanna think of it.\n\n480\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:33.300\nThis Company, anything having to do\nwith it and or individuals named herein.\n\n481\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.624\nCherokee and Adam, write anything\nhaving to do either of them.\n\n482\n00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:39.564\nWould be valuable and therefore we wanna\nsee that, but anything everything do in\n\n483\n00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:42.216\nany other companies is not to be touched,\nis not to be recorded, right?\n\n484\n00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:46.696\nThat's what traditionally a search warrant\nand/or any discovery process will engage\n\n485\n00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:47.310\nus around.\n\n486\n00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.149\nSo understanding how to\nlook at these systems and\n\n487\n00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:52.652\ninteract with them is gonna be important.\n\n488\n00:23:52.652 --> 00:24:00.446\nSo if you give me just one second to pull\nthis up here, l will do the following.\n\n489\n00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:00.982\nThere we go.\n\n490\n00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:03.688\nSo wanted to just take a look so\nthat way I can talk to you, but\n\n491\n00:24:03.688 --> 00:24:05.630\nalso take a look at them in real time.\n\n492\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.060\nSo if we can go full screen,\ncuz I'm sitting over part of it and\n\n493\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.750\nit's kind of off to the side and\nhard to see.\n\n494\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.090\nSo how do we examine the Linux\nemail based server logs?\n\n495\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.820\nSendMail is used in Linux, Unix system, so\njust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n496\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.050\nThat's the program or\nthe command, and the Daemon and\n\n497\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.430\nthe system services that are used,\nwe'll call it SendMail.\n\n498\n00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.040\nPretty straightforward, right?\n\n499\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.211\nNo misunderstanding as to\nwhat's happening there, right?\n\n500\n00:24:27.211 --> 00:24:28.547\n&gt;&gt; Sending mail.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna send mail, right?\n\n501\n00:24:28.547 --> 00:24:30.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, Linux and\n\n502\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.050\nUnix systems will also use\nwhat we call CIS log servers.\n\n503\n00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.270\nWe talk a lot about syslog in\nmany of our system discussions,\n\n504\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.500\nespecially in security.\n\n505\n00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.400\nWe think of this more broadly these days\nas SIEM, S-I-E-M, System Information or\n\n506\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.150\nSecurity Information Event Management\ncapabilities as we aggregate multiple\n\n507\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.920\nlogs from different systems opt into\na common system where we can analyze data,\n\n508\n00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.350\nvisualize things like that.\n\n509\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.540\nBut generically the technologies\nbeen referred to a syslogging for\n\n510\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.440\nlong, long time.\n\n511\n00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.920\nThis is what's done to maintain logs and\nso\n\n512\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.510\nwhat's happening on the system in general,\nlocally on individual systems.\n\n513\n00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:07.212\nThere's a config file for the syslog\ndaemon@csyslog.com is gonna be the file\n\n514\n00:25:07.212 --> 00:25:10.511\nthat determines location of\nwhere those files will be or\n\n515\n00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:12.491\nrather where these logs will be.\n\n516\n00:25:12.491 --> 00:25:14.117\nSo we have to know that\nas an investigator,\n\n517\n00:25:14.117 --> 00:25:16.525\nso that we'll be able to go in and\nfigure out where the logs are.\n\n518\n00:25:16.525 --> 00:25:21.166\nThey're maybe in a nonstandard location\nand we would have to know that and read\n\n519\n00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:25.900\nthe syslog.com file in the etc directory\nin order to be able to figure that out.\n\n520\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.118\nSo we would have to know that path.\n\n521\n00:25:27.118 --> 00:25:30.909\nYou may have to know that path if you're\nbeing asked about it, perhaps some point\n\n522\n00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:34.420\nin the future, when you're sitting in\na room, and things are flying at you\n\n523\n00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.922\nfast and furious on a computer screen and\nthere's a clock clicking down.\n\n524\n00:25:37.922 --> 00:25:40.650\nAt least that's what I've been told,\nanyway.\n\n525\n00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.860\nSyslog configuration files contain\ninformation on not just the location, but\n\n526\n00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.710\nthe logging priority where logs are gonna\nbe collected, where they're sent and\n\n527\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.200\naggregated, and other actions that\nmay pertain to their management.\n\n528\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.860\nIt's important to know and\nread up on that, or at least go in and\n\n529\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.780\ntake a look at what's there.\n\n530\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.940\nThe comp file provides location of a log\nfile, all log files including email.\n\n531\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.210\nThat's usually going to be VAR log,\nmaillog on these systems.\n\n532\n00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.140\nBut again, it could be somewhere else.\n\n533\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.175\nHard to say so again we wanna know that.\n\n534\n00:26:08.175 --> 00:26:13.915\nBut when I say var, log, maillog, var\nis the directory, log is the directory,\n\n535\n00:26:13.915 --> 00:26:18.403\nmaillog is the actual file or\nset of files that we would look at.\n\n536\n00:26:18.403 --> 00:26:22.913\n/var/log/mailog, the file there will\nhave a lot of information, right?\n\n537\n00:26:22.913 --> 00:26:26.000\nThings we traditionally think of,\nsource and destination IP addresses,\n\n538\n00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.500\nwe've talked about that.\n\n539\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.415\nDate and time stamps,\nwe talked about those.\n\n540\n00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.835\nA lot of other information\nthat may be important\n\n541\n00:26:31.835 --> 00:26:34.485\nto validate the data within an email,\nheader will be contained there.\n\n542\n00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:37.575\nSo we do wanna know that, and\njust make sure that we're aware of that.\n\n543\n00:26:37.575 --> 00:26:42.185\nThe same idea with regards to examining\nthe logs on an exchange server.\n\n544\n00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:46.075\nSo on the Microsoft side kind of same\nthought process, but what goes on there?\n\n545\n00:26:46.075 --> 00:26:50.295\nMicrosoft Exchange uses the ESE,\nthe Extensible Storage Engine.\n\n546\n00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:52.887\nSo that's the name of the technology\non the Microsoft side.\n\n547\n00:26:52.887 --> 00:26:57.150\nWe have to primarily focus on a certain\ngroup of files that are gonna be valuable\n\n548\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.779\nfor us on the Microsoft side.\n\n549\n00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:03.360\nYou'll see them listed right here,\n.edb database files provide MAPI\n\n550\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.641\ninformation and\nhave the MAPI information for us,\n\n551\n00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:11.520\n.stm string database files,\nresponsible for non MAPI information.\n\n552\n00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.380\nDepends on the versioning\nof the email system.\n\n553\n00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.080\nYou have to go backwards in time to older\nsystems, forwards to the newer ones.\n\n554\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.520\nYou still see these, but\nthey may move around and\n\n555\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.780\nmay not always be in the same place,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n556\n00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.260\nCheckpoint files, so\nthat we can reestablish and\n\n557\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.700\nvalidate information as it\ngoes into the databases.\n\n558\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.030\nAnd you'll know that it's\nbeen committed properly,\n\n559\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.060\nand restore data from a certain\npoint if there's corruption.\n\n560\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.870\nTemp files, always important to\ngo after those and look at those.\n\n561\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.024\nSo these are files and file types\nthat we would wanna be looking at.\n\n562\n00:27:40.024 --> 00:27:44.560\nCheckpoint files help us as I said to\nfigure out data, loss due to errors and\n\n563\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.931\ntherefore recovery.\n\n564\n00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:49.801\nTemp files store a bunch of information,\nespecially things that are gonna have\n\n565\n00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:53.910\nto be worked through in the system, you\ncould think of these as queues as well.\n\n566\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.743\nWe will often get a lot of information\nflooding into a system in a very short\n\n567\n00:27:56.743 --> 00:27:57.393\namount of time.\n\n568\n00:27:57.393 --> 00:27:59.169\nAnd we'll create temp files and\n\n569\n00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:03.330\nqueues to essentially buffer that\ninformation till we can get to it.\n\n570\n00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.330\nAnd if the system is compromised,\nwe may wanna look at temp files and\n\n571\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.290\nsee what's in there.\n\n572\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.020\nThere maybe evidence of the attack\nindoor things like that, right?\n\n573\n00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.420\nSo things like that would be helpful.\n\n574\n00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.920\nAnd also transaction logs that tell us\nwhat's going on in the database, so\n\n575\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.360\nwe can track what's being done and\nwhat's happening there.\n\n576\n00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.800\nWe're gonna wanna know and\nunderstand about all of that.\n\n577\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.323\nSo that's all gonna be important for\nus and\n\n578\n00:28:24.323 --> 00:28:28.530\nthings that we do after think about\nby platform as a CHFI investigator,\n\n579\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.050\ngonna wanna be able to distinguish\nbetween Linux and Unix.\n\n580\n00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:36.196\nYou could see the logic is the same,\nbut the specificity of where we go,\n\n581\n00:28:36.196 --> 00:28:40.016\nkinda files we go after,\nthe names of those files are different.\n\n582\n00:28:40.016 --> 00:28:43.877\nAnd that's the kind of information\nthat would, number one be helpful for\n\n583\n00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:45.130\nus taking into an exam.\n\n584\n00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.440\nBut number two, equally important,\n\n585\n00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.210\neven more important in many\nrespects in the real world.\n\n586\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.530\nWe have to bring to the party, right?\n\n587\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.740\nWe have to as the forensic investigator as\na security professional whose doing this\n\n588\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.160\nfor real, you gotta show up and you gotta\nbe able to know, hey, it's a mail server,\n\n589\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.810\nI've gotta go after these files\non this kind of platform.\n\n590\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.629\nYou should not be out there Googling,\nright,\n\n591\n00:29:03.629 --> 00:29:05.037\nevery step of the way to do your job.\n\n592\n00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:09.334\nThat's just not the best way to show up\nand have your game face on as they say,\n\n593\n00:29:09.334 --> 00:29:10.350\nbe prepared for.\n\n594\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.911\nI'm not suggesting that you can't look\nsomething up if you don't know it.\n\n595\n00:29:12.911 --> 00:29:15.660\nI'm not suggesting you gotta\ncommit all this stuff to memory.\n\n596\n00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.540\nWhat I am suggesting is that\nif you're gonna do this for\n\n597\n00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.080\na living, this is the kind of stuff\nthat you gotta learn how to do.\n\n598\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.560\nAnd the more you do, the more you know.\n\n599\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.450\nAnd if you're that forensic investigator\nthat doesn't specialize in email systems,\n\n600\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.000\nbut knows everything about databases,\nawesome.\n\n601\n00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.010\nTeam up, right?\n\n602\n00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.920\nThat's we've been talking\nabout that all along.\n\n603\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.270\nPlay to your strengths, minimizing\nyour weaknesses as part of that.\n\n604\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.939\nYou be the lead on\nthe database investigation,\n\n605\n00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:42.742\nget the other people that are experts\non email in as part of the team or\n\n606\n00:29:42.742 --> 00:29:47.146\ngo ask for their help, or find them and\nthen have them walk through the logic and\n\n607\n00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.107\nhave them take care of that piece.\n\n608\n00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:50.985\nBut don't get in over your head, right?\n\n609\n00:29:50.985 --> 00:29:52.929\nIt's probably the most important\nmessage we can think about,\n\n610\n00:29:52.929 --> 00:29:54.627\ncuz that's gonna prove to be a problem,\nultimately.\n\n611\n00:29:54.627 --> 00:29:56.161\n&gt;&gt; And as with just about any,\n\n612\n00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:59.916\nmost investigations you wanna think\nabout time is of the essence.\n\n613\n00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:04.432\nWe don't wanna lot of this information to\nbecome stale, if you are having to look up\n\n614\n00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:08.432\nevery single component that you wanna\nresearch or any kind of task that you\n\n615\n00:30:08.432 --> 00:30:12.330\nwanna execute, that's just gonna\nbe wasting time at that point.\n\n616\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.170\n&gt;&gt; It is and\ntime is the most crucial thing we have.\n\n617\n00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.128\nThe most crucial resource we could\nput into our pocket and validate and\n\n618\n00:30:19.128 --> 00:30:20.280\nuse to our benefit.\n\n619\n00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.800\nBut also can easily turn against us,\nit's Cherokee's point.\n\n620\n00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.869\nIf we're not able to really get in\nthere quickly Do things we have to do.\n\n621\n00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:29.271\nRemember we talked about the order\nof volatility of evidence and\n\n622\n00:30:29.271 --> 00:30:33.880\nmany of our prior conversations, both\nnon-volatile, static, volatile, right?\n\n623\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.799\nDynamic and remnant kinds of evidence that\nexist in the system three categories of\n\n624\n00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:39.289\ndata and how we deal with them.\n\n625\n00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:44.041\nAnd although there is in theory, perhaps\nnot a time ticking down event around\n\n626\n00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:47.770\ncertain kinds of volatile data,\nstuff that's in memory for\n\n627\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.880\ninstance in theory would be there\nas long as you don't lose power.\n\n628\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.440\nBut we know that certain kinds of data is\nregistered in the system with a TTL or\n\n629\n00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.710\nthe time to live and that certain\nregistrations will tick down to zero and\n\n630\n00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.680\ndisappear.\n\n631\n00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.550\nAnd if we have not captured them to your\npoint we would lose the opportunity to\n\n632\n00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.200\ndo so.\n\n633\n00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.370\nWe've talked extensively about that\nin many of our prior conversations.\n\n634\n00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.920\nSo it is important to be aware of that and\nto think about that.\n\n635\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.440\nJust wanna wrap up, because I know we\nare edging up against, actually I'm lying\n\n636\n00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.320\nwe've totally passed by our hey we're\nout of bounds and out of time marker.\n\n637\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.120\nBut I am gonna push through, because we\nhave one more thing quickly to talk about.\n\n638\n00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.680\nAnd we can go back full screen here for\njust one second.\n\n639\n00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.530\nSo I wanna throw out the US laws\nagainst email related crimes\n\n640\n00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.050\nthat you may wanna take note of them and\nbe aware of.\n\n641\n00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.480\nKeep in mind at this point, many, many\ntimes before especially in the beginning\n\n642\n00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.340\nepisodes as we took a look at\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n643\n00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.700\nAnd talked about the Federal Rules\nassociated with forensics investigation,\n\n644\n00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.670\nthings like that.\n\n645\n00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.670\nAnd why those are being talked about\nfrom the US perspective even though\n\n646\n00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.280\nwe know we have many viewers, and many\nmembers that may be looking at this around\n\n647\n00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.450\nthe world and may not be using the Federal\nRules of Evidence of the United States\n\n648\n00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.080\nstandards for instance for\nthings like this.\n\n649\n00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.212\nBut the exam specific material\nthat you would wanna know about is\n\n650\n00:31:56.212 --> 00:31:57.261\ngeared around this.\n\n651\n00:31:57.261 --> 00:32:00.370\nSo we're presenting it to make sure\nyou are aware of it, exam objectives.\n\n652\n00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.927\nIf you will, and if you're gonna\npractice in the United States,\n\n653\n00:32:03.927 --> 00:32:06.030\nclearly very important to know.\n\n654\n00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.770\nIf you're not, it's equally important to\nfigure out what the localized versions of\n\n655\n00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.070\nwhatever these laws may or\nmay not be by country, by geography,\n\n656\n00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.950\nby region will be for you.\n\n657\n00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.090\nAnd to take note of them and\n\n658\n00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.470\nto incorporate them into\nyour ability to do your job.\n\n659\n00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.190\nBut in the US,\nlaws that can seem unrelated crimes,\n\n660\n00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.320\nfour of them in particular.\n\n661\n00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.027\nThe CAN-SPAM Act, you'll see it there.\n\n662\n00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:29.770\nControlling the assault of non-solicited\npornography and marketing act is\n\n663\n00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:35.700\nwhat it actually is translated into when\nyou actually walk the whole thing out.\n\n664\n00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.896\n18 USC, 2252A, and\n\n665\n00:32:36.896 --> 00:32:40.276\n2252B transmission covering\nthe transmission of child pornography and\n\n666\n00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:43.765\nmanipulation of domain names or other\nmeans to provide access to pornography.\n\n667\n00:32:43.765 --> 00:32:47.574\nThese are the statutes that child\npornography cases are prosecuted under\n\n668\n00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:51.640\nin the United States, or international\ntreaties that deal with this as well.\n\n669\n00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.890\nBut in the US these are the statues\nthat are used when every so\n\n670\n00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.595\noften you hear about somebody being\narrested on suspicion of this or\n\n671\n00:32:58.595 --> 00:33:00.910\nbeing brought up on charges of this.\n\n672\n00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.255\nThese are the laws and acts that\nare actually used and referenced.\n\n673\n00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:08.673\nAnd residents in Washington, DC,\nspecifically, as a separate entity,\n\n674\n00:33:08.673 --> 00:33:14.003\nkind of interestingly, are governed by\nRCW 19.190.020, which is a localized\n\n675\n00:33:14.003 --> 00:33:18.792\nset of rules specific to that little\nenclave that are unique to Washington, DC.\n\n676\n00:33:18.792 --> 00:33:22.674\nBecause it has a special status, and\nit has some laws that are unique to the DC\n\n677\n00:33:22.674 --> 00:33:26.970\nenclave, even though Federal law is\nthe law of the land in the Untied States.\n\n678\n00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.220\nThere actually are certain laws in the\ncapital that are unique to that particular\n\n679\n00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.129\narea that are gonna be\napplied there as well, so\n\n680\n00:33:32.129 --> 00:33:34.061\nthat's kind of interesting\nthought process.\n\n681\n00:33:34.061 --> 00:33:38.073\nBut some things you would wanna know about\nand be aware of with regards to email\n\n682\n00:33:38.073 --> 00:33:41.680\nlaws, in this case laws related\nto crimes committed with email.\n\n683\n00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.129\nVery important take note and\nbe aware of those as well.\n\n684\n00:33:43.129 --> 00:33:44.821\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam.\n\n685\n00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:48.204\nWe've covered a lot when we focus\nabout our email centric crimes, but\n\n686\n00:33:48.204 --> 00:33:50.300\nwe do have more information to go.\n\n687\n00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.826\nSo ladies and gentlemen stay tuned for\nthis show will go ahead and sign out.\n\n688\n00:33:53.826 --> 00:33:55.392\nRemember I am your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n689\n00:33:55.392 --> 00:33:56.880\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n690\n00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.978\n&gt;&gt;

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia [INAUDIBLE].\n\n4\n00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:08.423\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:11.815\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.479\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CHFI version 9 series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:15.959\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.605\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be looking at some demonstrations,\n\n9\n00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:23.740\nand we'll be focusing on how we can\ngo ahead and use different tools and\n\n10\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.320\nutilities for email investigations.\n\n11\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.380\nAnd back in the studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.520\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Going well, hopefully going well for\nall of you out there.\n\n14\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.770\nAs Cherokee said,\nwe are gonna focus in on email, and\n\n15\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.405\na little bit of email forensics.\n\n16\n00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:39.160\nWe talked about how to do it, but\n\n17\n00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.490\nreally not worth anything unless we\nshow you how do it as well, right?\n\n18\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.021\nSo we're gonna take a look at this,\n\n19\n00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.176\nand I'm gonna show you\nsomething extra special.\n\n20\n00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:48.443\nI'm gonna show you a tool that we can use,\nfrom a forensic standpoint,\n\n21\n00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:51.384\nto zero in on and read the host headers,\nwe talked about this, or\n\n22\n00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.869\nthe email header to figure out and\ntriangulate visually, essentially take\n\n23\n00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.770\na trace router approach to visually\nrepresent where somebody is sending from.\n\n24\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.590\nBut I'm gonna show you how we can easily,\nfrom a hacker perspective,\n\n25\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.230\nfrom an anti-forensics perspective,\nas we've talked about in prior episodes,\n\n26\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.650\nbring that knowledge back a little bit and\nshow it to you here.\n\n27\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.060\nTake a slightly different approach.\n\n28\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.354\nI'm gonna show you how we modify the email\nheader to hide where we are, and\n\n29\n00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:14.868\nhow we can trick a tool like\nthis very easily by doing so.\n\n30\n00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:17.730\nAnd I'm gonna explain what I mean\nwhen we get to that part of the demo.\n\n31\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.302\nAll right, so let's take a look.\n\n32\n00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:22.740\nIf you join me here, we're gonna\nstart out on our Server 12 machine.\n\n33\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.420\nGot a couple of tools loaded up\nhere that may be of interest to us.\n\n34\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.512\nSo we can go full screen so\nwe could take a look.\n\n35\n00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:31.797\nI've already gone ahead and loaded up a\nPST file, and I've opened it up with this\n\n36\n00:01:31.797 --> 00:01:35.768\ntool that's gonna allow me to go in and\njust essentially bring up the PST and\n\n37\n00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:38.395\ninterrogate it and\nfind out what is in there.\n\n38\n00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:41.023\nThat way we could see what kind\nof information we may have.\n\n39\n00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:43.275\nSo I loaded up the file,\n\n40\n00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:47.395\njust opened up the email file using\nthis particular item right here.\n\n41\n00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:50.075\nAnd I've got, as you can see,\njust emails highlighted.\n\n42\n00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.205\nHave a bunch of stuff in\ndifferent categories.\n\n43\n00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.680\nI've got Incomplete Items,\nRecovered Items.\n\n44\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.960\nI've got All Mail, Important,\nSent Mail, Trash, Inbox, whatever.\n\n45\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.240\nAnd I'm highlighting a message and\n\n46\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.420\nI'm actually looking at the contents\nof the message right here.\n\n47\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.380\nWe can see what that\nmessage would look like.\n\n48\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.570\nI'm actually reading somebody's\nrecovered email just from their PST.\n\n49\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.940\nWhich is not magic or rocket science,\nPSTs have emails in them.\n\n50\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.470\nWe know that, we expect that.\n\n51\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.536\nBut keep in mind that I can easily,\neasy being a relative term,\n\n52\n00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.858\nI can easily get access to the contents\nif I have access to the file.\n\n53\n00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:24.140\nAnd of course, if I have tools\nthat will allow me to do so.\n\n54\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.790\nAnd all I did was open up\nthe email file by going out and\n\n55\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.510\ngrabbing one or more PST files,\nI have them here.\n\n56\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.440\nAnd just loading them up in the browser,\nand\n\n57\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.060\nthen allowing myself to be able\nto go through and find them.\n\n58\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.490\nAnd you could see here, for\ninstance, I have Incomplete Items.\n\n59\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.950\nItems that may or\nmay not have been recoverable for\n\n60\n00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.290\nsome reason, no message text found for\nwhatever reason.\n\n61\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.721\nI may be able to go in with a tool like\nthis, this is called Recover My eMail,\n\n62\n00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:54.580\nby the way, it's the name of this tool.\n\n63\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.920\nI think I may have forgotten to\nsay that while we were talking.\n\n64\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.112\nI know you always like it when I tell\nyou the name of our tools, Cherokee.\n\n65\n00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:00.671\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; So you can\n\n66\n00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.970\nmake sure everybody knows what they are.\n\n67\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.630\nSo this is called Recover My eMail,\n\n68\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.030\njust one of the many tools\nout there that does this.\n\n69\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.952\nAnd you could see that I can search, and\nI could do a pretty detailed search.\n\n70\n00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:15.612\nI could do By From, By To, By Subject,\nBy Date, By Size, By Attachment, By ID,\n\n71\n00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:21.350\nInclude messages with empty body or\nunknown bodies using special characters.\n\n72\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.820\nSo I have a fairly detailed search\n\n73\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.400\nparameter set that I can bring to\nbare on the data in this tool.\n\n74\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.808\nBut this is a pretty straightforward tool.\n\n75\n00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:32.782\nWe're not really doing anything\nincredibly mysterious with this tool.\n\n76\n00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:35.840\nWe're just looking at a PST file.\n\n77\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.440\nI could use a little bit\nmore of a bigger gun here.\n\n78\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.541\nI can use a tool,\nyou've seen me use this tool before for\n\n79\n00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.482\ninterrogating data directly\nin my Windows 10 VMs.\n\n80\n00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:50.647\nAnd you've seen me use it on my quote\nunquote forensic workstation that we're\n\n81\n00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.750\nmaking that Windows 10 machine\nto kind of approximate.\n\n82\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.962\nYou've seen me use it to be able\nto set up and open up a case.\n\n83\n00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:58.342\nThis is just another use for\n\n84\n00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:01.523\nthis tool, but this is focused\non the email specifically, and\n\n85\n00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:05.380\nI'll show you how to set the tool up\nafter we get done, as we always do.\n\n86\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.380\nOnce we take a look at the preloaded\ncontent, we'll walk back out,\n\n87\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.770\nreestablish it, and just show you quickly\nhow to walk through and open up a case.\n\n88\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.540\nBut I've gone through and\nI've loaded the Outlook Personal Storage.\n\n89\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.280\nOne of the PST files here, as you can see,\nInbox, Junk E-mail, Receipts, Travel,\n\n90\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.830\nWork, whatever the case may be.\n\n91\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.579\nI can highlight one or\nmore of these messages, and\n\n92\n00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:31.304\nyou'll see down here I can take a look\nat the email data, whatever it may be.\n\n93\n00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:36.520\nI can actually go in, I can see\ninformation about whatever the email is.\n\n94\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.620\nI can highlight it,\nit's very straightforward.\n\n95\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.120\nI can see the unique identifier string.\n\n96\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.160\nI can actually see information.\n\n97\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.420\nI could see the Properties of the message.\n\n98\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.690\nI could see what was done in\nterms of the Content Analysis.\n\n99\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.626\nSo I can drill down and I can look at\nany one of these categories, right?\n\n100\n00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.868\nBut I also can go in, and\nI can read a specific message, or\n\n101\n00:04:55.868 --> 00:04:57.860\nlook at a specific message.\n\n102\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.710\nWhichever the message may be,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n103\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.990\nBut I can go in and I can highlight it,\njust like I did in the other tool, and\n\n104\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.170\nsee the contents of the message.\n\n105\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.150\nAll these tools basically\nare working the same way.\n\n106\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.230\nThey're gonna show us, or examine for\nus, and then let us see the email data.\n\n107\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.610\nThis one just looks a little busier,\n\n108\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.680\na little bit more of an interface that's\ngot a bunch of bells and whistles.\n\n109\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.399\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's basically the same.\n\n110\n00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.362\nKeyword-\n&gt;&gt; And what was this called?\n\n111\n00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:20.810\nI think I missed it from a previous show.\n\n112\n00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.584\n&gt;&gt; It's because I haven't told you yet.\n\n113\n00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:23.830\nI'm gonna tell you,\nI'm gonna show it to you in just a minute.\n\n114\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.280\nSo I have a Keyword Search here,\nAdvanced Search, Sort Files.\n\n115\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.380\nIf I go in and do an Advanced Search,\n\n116\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.230\nfor instance, I have the ability to go in\nand search for Text and or Hex search.\n\n117\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.440\nSo I could do some pretty\ndetailed searching.\n\n118\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.110\nI can go in, do a Keyword Search, look for\n\n119\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.410\nvarious keywords,\njust like we did in the other one, right?\n\n120\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.160\nSo what we're doing,\nlet's just close out of this tool.\n\n121\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.540\nWe'll open it back up so you can see it.\n\n122\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.290\nIt's called E-mail Examiner.\n\n123\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.830\nSo just give us a second.\n\n124\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.410\nNo, okay, I already have it running.\n\n125\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.885\nI just closed it.\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n126\n00:05:58.885 --> 00:06:00.890\nYou know what I did?\n\n127\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.712\nHold on one second, I know what I did.\n\n128\n00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:06.736\nI started it up and\n\n129\n00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:11.670\nI did not do the following.\n\n130\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.780\nHold on one second, let me go in,\nthere we go right there.\n\n131\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.011\nI'll just kill that, and go in here,\n\n132\n00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:23.050\nand let me just make sure it is gone.\n\n133\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.379\nCuz it should be gone, but\nthere it is, right there.\n\n134\n00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.270\nYeah, it's running in the background.\n\n135\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.021\nSo let's just go in, and\nthere we go, End task.\n\n136\n00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:34.271\nAll right, there we go,\nthat should allow us to run that.\n\n137\n00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:39.088\nSo just to bring it up so you can see it,\n\n138\n00:06:39.088 --> 00:06:41.356\nit just asked us to activate\nit cuz it's a demo product.\n\n139\n00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:44.195\nNo big deal, we're just gonna\nclick Later normally to do that.\n\n140\n00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.729\nWe'll give it a minute.\nIt does take a minute to load, so\n\n141\n00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.920\ndon't be concerned when you don't\nsee anything coming up right away.\n\n142\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.150\nBut you'll see here, Paraben's EMX\nEmail Examiner is the name of the tool.\n\n143\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.216\nParaben is the manufacturer\nof a lot of the tools we use,\n\n144\n00:06:56.216 --> 00:07:00.338\none of the standard sets of evidence\ngathering and case management tools.\n\n145\n00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:04.672\nParaben, in this case, Email Examiner,\nlets us Add Evidence, Open a Case,\n\n146\n00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:05.900\nCreate a New Case.\n\n147\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.220\nSo I would go ahead and Create a New Case.\n\n148\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.450\nIt's what I did just to start\nout what we were doing.\n\n149\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.600\nWe just have some general\ninformation we're asked for here.\n\n150\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.250\nAgain, just like we did before.\n\n151\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.570\nWhat's the Case name?\n\n152\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.360\nI'll do ITPROtv,\nthat one was called case 1.\n\n153\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.493\nI'll do TV, case 2, E-mail, right?\n\n154\n00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:26.070\nYou would obviously give this a name\nthat is a little more meaningful.\n\n155\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.942\nSpecify the Investigator name.\n\n156\n00:07:28.942 --> 00:07:33.322\nYou'll see I've already got my name there,\nand it pre-populates all the information\n\n157\n00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:36.120\nthat I put in before,\nthe Agency, the Phone, the Fax.\n\n158\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.620\nI put a Fax in.\n\n159\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.630\nLook at that, you see that?\n\n160\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Super fancy.\n\n161\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.112\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee and\nI were talking about faxes and-\n\n162\n00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:41.770\n&gt;&gt; Bringing it way back.\n\n163\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.730\n&gt;&gt; How critical they\nare to modern business.\n\n164\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.650\nAnd so just all that stuff,\nand then I hit Finish.\n\n165\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.280\nIt's then gonna ask me\nwhere I wanna store it.\n\n166\n00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.270\nYou can see case 1's already there.\n\n167\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.520\nI'll just go ahead and\nstore it in the same folder.\n\n168\n00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.960\nTakes just a minute to open the case file,\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n169\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.964\nAnd then once we get this up and running,\nwe're asked to add our Evidence in.\n\n170\n00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:01.675\nThis is where I went in and\ngrabbed the PST file, so\n\n171\n00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:05.090\nI did the Outlook database and\njust went in and grabbed it.\n\n172\n00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.722\nBut notice all the different options here.\n\n173\n00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:11.550\nAuto-detect, AOL, offline database and\nor Outlook database, so\n\n174\n00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.130\nOST, PST files, right,\nwhatever they would be.\n\n175\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.508\nI've got Thunderbird,\ngot Outlook Express, Eudora.\n\n176\n00:08:18.508 --> 00:08:22.013\nGot Email Examiner archive, so\na Paraben Email Examiner Archive,\n\n177\n00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:25.090\none I've already created\na file from somewhere else.\n\n178\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.183\nGoogle Storage,\nWindows Mail database, right?\n\n179\n00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:30.940\nSo all sorts of different ones\nare available for the tool.\n\n180\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.460\nI would just choose\nthe option I had before.\n\n181\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.347\nGo grab the appropriate PST file and\nit loads it up for me, right?\n\n182\n00:08:37.347 --> 00:08:41.650\nSo I can go in and\ngrab whichever one it is, give it a name.\n\n183\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.330\nSpecify do I wanna scan the data base for\ndeleted messages?\n\n184\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.230\nIt makes it a little bit slower to open.\n\n185\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.810\nThis is a smaller one,\nit won't take as long.\n\n186\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.380\nSo it'll come up pretty quickly.\n\n187\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.050\nAnd then specify what I wanna do here.\n\n188\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.632\nSort Data, Index keywords, Extract and\nindex keywords for graphic files.\n\n189\n00:08:57.632 --> 00:09:00.820\nDo a little OCR,\noptical character recognition.\n\n190\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.365\nWhat language am I gonna be doing this in?\n\n191\n00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:06.421\nScan for malware, don't wanna load\nmalware obviously and execute that,\n\n192\n00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.834\nthat would be a bad thing, right?\n\n193\n00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:10.766\nNot a good way to spend the afternoon,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:13.422\nSo then include files of\nany undetected format.\n\n195\n00:09:13.422 --> 00:09:16.740\nAnd do I wanna save my choices as default,\nyes or no?\n\n196\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.041\nClick Finish, it'll take just a moment.\n\n197\n00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:19.910\nIt'll go in and open that up.\n\n198\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.030\nI could see the current content\nis being analyzed and running.\n\n199\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.677\nSo it's actually running.\n\n200\n00:09:23.677 --> 00:09:25.426\nThis is what I did to set the demo up for\n\n201\n00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:28.830\nus a few minutes ago before we actually\nwent in and saw it all completed.\n\n202\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.240\nI just preloaded all this cuz it\ntakes a few minutes to run through.\n\n203\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.430\nSo it's currently doing\nthe Content Analysis.\n\n204\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.010\nEventually you'll see,\nit doesn't take very long on a small file,\n\n205\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.660\nswitches to Completed,\nand I'm able to see.\n\n206\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.250\nI could just drill through, open this up.\n\n207\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.025\nAnd as I go through top of\nthe Outlook file, I can go through,\n\n208\n00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:53.130\nyou'll see all that and just see what I\nam going through and looking at there.\n\n209\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.428\nAnd I could just see all\nthe different messages and\n\n210\n00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.630\nall the different stuff that's there.\n\n211\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.830\nAnd if you notice, it shows me the Size,\nthe Deleted, Last Modified, Received.\n\n212\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.440\nJust all that kinda stuff, Sent, etc.\n\n213\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.996\nAll that kinda stuff is being\nshow here for the email.\n\n214\n00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:10.799\nAnd I can actually begin to build\nthe case with this, and say, okay,\n\n215\n00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:13.400\nhere is all the email I found documented.\n\n216\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.920\nIn upcoming episodes we'll talk about what\nit means to be a professional witness or\n\n217\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.630\na technically proficient expert witness.\n\n218\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.749\nHow do we generate the kind of forensic\nreports that may be needed to show and\n\n219\n00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:24.901\nactually display a trial?\n\n220\n00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:28.403\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nwhat a standard report looks like.\n\n221\n00:10:28.403 --> 00:10:30.806\nAnd you would see how to take\nsome of this information and\n\n222\n00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:33.733\nactually output it to a report and\nput it into that standard format.\n\n223\n00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:36.690\nSo it would be valuable for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n224\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.316\nI'm gonna get out of this particular\nmachine, go to my Windows 10 machine.\n\n225\n00:10:39.316 --> 00:10:41.580\nThis is my demo machine.\n\n226\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.800\nMy normal machine that I work on on a\nregular basis, I've got another tool here.\n\n227\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.950\nThis is eMailTrackerPro, yet\nanother tool that we can use.\n\n228\n00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.815\nThis is that visual traceroute\ntool that I was talking about.\n\n229\n00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:53.770\nIf you're familiar with VisualRoute,\nan oldie but\n\n230\n00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.350\na goodie, a tool that we would talk\nabout in hacking classes, for instance.\n\n231\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.202\nSo if you've ever seen any of\nthe CEH content that I've done,\n\n232\n00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:02.490\nyou would see us talk about\ntools like this here.\n\n233\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.380\nIt would be in most of your toolkits if\nyou are doing network administration,\n\n234\n00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.230\nmanaging routing, things like that.\n\n235\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.120\nIt is a visual traceroute overlay,\nso we do traceroute,\n\n236\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.290\nit gives us visual mapping capabilities,\nbeen around for a long time.\n\n237\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.280\nVery good tool.\n\n238\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.760\nWe use it for\nforensic investigation as well.\n\n239\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.210\nWe can load a email header into the tool,\nand we can then have it go through,\n\n240\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.866\ndo a traceroute,\nwhich it's doing down here at the bottom.\n\n241\n00:11:27.866 --> 00:11:32.488\nAnd it could then actually show us\nwhere the email has originated from and\n\n242\n00:11:32.488 --> 00:11:34.548\ntrace back all the way through.\n\n243\n00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:39.024\nNow I took an email header, and I modified\nit, and I changed the To and the From.\n\n244\n00:11:39.024 --> 00:11:44.853\nAnd you can probably see over here,\nI've got some email addresses,\n\n245\n00:11:44.853 --> 00:11:51.060\nadam@itpro.tv and To cisspsme@gmail.com,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n246\n00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.310\nAnd I've got information here, and\n\n247\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.750\nI sent that header into\nthe system asset to analyze it.\n\n248\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.620\nAnd it's telling me, yeah,\nit looks like it originated from Malaysia.\n\n249\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.220\nWell, it didn't originate from Malaysia.\n\n250\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.140\nI could tell you for\na fact because the email that I'm using,\n\n251\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.670\nthe header that I use is\none that I just created.\n\n252\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.620\nAnd that, in theory,\nwould emanate from Florida and\n\n253\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.370\nwould dead end in the US, not in Malaysia.\n\n254\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.112\nAnd so a tool like this can be\nmanipulated and can be modified.\n\n255\n00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:21.166\nOr the data that we put into it,\nin other words, can be manipulated, and\n\n256\n00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:23.370\nthe output of the tool can be modified.\n\n257\n00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.713\nIf we are not paying attention, and\nif, as a forensic investigator,\n\n258\n00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:31.170\nwe are not clear on that fact,\nwe may have a problem.\n\n259\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.000\nBecause a tool like this\nwill be very valuable for\n\n260\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.360\nus to figure out where the header was.\n\n261\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.530\nAnd I did the Trace Header\nright here by going in and\n\n262\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.160\njust dumping in trace\nan email I have received.\n\n263\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.090\nAnd I just put in the host\nheader information.\n\n264\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.720\nAnd you'll notice there\nthat I can go in and\n\n265\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.610\nI can actually,\nthat's the one I didn't modify.\n\n266\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.860\nThat's the standard one, that's the one\nthat I started with and then I modified.\n\n267\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.580\nBut I can go in, and I can actually\ndump in that information and modify it.\n\n268\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.610\nAnd by changing or manipulating\nthe naming and the address conventions,\n\n269\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.820\nI skew and kinda throw off,\nif you will, the reference to it.\n\n270\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.690\nI can also Look up network responsible for\nan email address, right?\n\n271\n00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:15.718\nSo I can go in and say, hey,\nif I want to adam@itpro.tv.\n\n272\n00:13:15.718 --> 00:13:21.040\nIf I wanna use this and trace that,\nI can go in, and I'm starting the trace.\n\n273\n00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.510\nAnd we'll see it go from where it\nbegins and we'll walk through.\n\n274\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.530\nIt's starting to resolve,\nas you can see there.\n\n275\n00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:34.174\nAnd when it's done, that's kinda funny,\nit went from Gainesville to Germany,\n\n276\n00:13:34.174 --> 00:13:37.405\nand then back to Redmond,\nWashington via New York.\n\n277\n00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:42.919\n[LAUGH] But remember,\nthis is going to be in a Microsoft Online,\n\n278\n00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:46.570\nExchange Online Office 365 Systems.\n\n279\n00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.400\nSo it's gonna go to one of\nMicrosoft's data centers.\n\n280\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.750\nSo not totally surprising, but\nsurprisingly would go all the way across,\n\n281\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.990\nand then back again from Germany\nback to the United States by way of,\n\n282\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.100\nessentially, a really\ncircuitous West Coast,\n\n283\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.940\nEast Coast, Europe, back East Coast,\nall the way to West Coast trip.\n\n284\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.428\nBut considering we started out in the US.\n\n285\n00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:07.355\nBut it does tell us, ultimately,\nthat it dead ends in Redmond,\n\n286\n00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:10.705\nWashington on an inbound\nprotection Outlook system,\n\n287\n00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:15.363\nwhich is essentially the output or\nthe end point for Office365 in the data\n\n288\n00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:19.420\ncenters that are hosted on\nthe West Coast of the US for Microsoft.\n\n289\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.081\nSo we can see here that we\nare able to triangulate and\n\n290\n00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.220\nlocate where that system is.\n\n291\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.010\nAnd so VisualRoute and eMailTrackerPro\ncan be useful for this kind of stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.550\nSo just another tool that we can bring\nin and throw at the problem of, hey,\n\n293\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.420\nwho's sending?\n\n294\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.530\nWhere's it coming from?\n\n295\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.180\nWhere's it going to?\n\n296\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.730\nYou could see that's my\nemail address there.\n\n297\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.010\nThere's the IP address that does\nthe lookup and the resolution.\n\n298\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.340\nAnd it is allowing us to be able to find\nthat information for the Email Summary.\n\n299\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.300\nI could look at the Network Whois and\nsee some detailed information here.\n\n300\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.146\nIt belongs to Microsoft, as we know,\nbecause we already know it's Office365.\n\n301\n00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:57.570\nBut if we didn't know that\nwe can go take a look.\n\n302\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.300\nOne Microsoft Way, right,\nso out in Redmond.\n\n303\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.090\nAnd the domain information may or\nmay not be resolved for that.\n\n304\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.410\nThat's a front-end box.\n\n305\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.210\nIt's not gonna resolve to\nMicrosoft Online, right?\n\n306\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.940\nThat's just probably the spam filter,\nor the inbound gateway,\n\n307\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.550\nthe threat mitigation gateway for\nthe inbound mail system.\n\n308\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.860\nBut at least we can see the network\ntraffic and find out what's going on.\n\n309\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.150\nSo tools like this can be very valuable.\n\n310\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.820\nWe don't wanna underestimate,\nin other words, the basic blocking and\n\n311\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.430\ntackling of name resolution,\nnetwork resolution, network lookup,\n\n312\n00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.875\nemail validation as part of\nthe forensics investigative process.\n\n313\n00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:32.453\nBecause that could tell us so\nmuch about what we're seeing and\n\n314\n00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:33.602\nwhether the data is valid.\n\n315\n00:15:33.602 --> 00:15:37.261\nAnd as a result, whether we can trust\nwhat we're seeing, or it looks like\n\n316\n00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:41.860\nit's strange, and may as a result, have\nbeen modified and may not be trustworthy.\n\n317\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.172\nSo it's very important for us to keep\nthat in mind and to be aware of that.\n\n318\n00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:45.475\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Adam, thank you for\n\n319\n00:15:45.475 --> 00:15:49.384\nshowing us those different tools that we\ncan go ahead and examine our PST files, or\n\n320\n00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:52.689\nthat header information to see if\nit has or has not been manipulated.\n\n321\n00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:53.689\nSo thank you for that.\n\n322\n00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:55.834\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in today.\n\n323\n00:15:55.834 --> 00:15:58.580\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n324\n00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.010\nFor this show, we'll sign out.\n\n325\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.940\nAs your host, remember,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n326\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.650\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n327\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.375\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n328\n00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:04.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then I guess I can't be Cherokee.\n\n329\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.860\nI must be Adam then.\n\n330\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.542\n&gt;&gt; All right, see you next time, bye.\n\n331\n00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:08.662\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n332\n00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:16.006\n[MUSIC]\n\n333\n00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:18.070\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.281\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\nCHFI version nine series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.097\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:19.664\nIn this episode we will be taking\na look at mobile forensics and\n\n6\n00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.457\nwith us today back in studios.\n\n7\n00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:22.815\nWe have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.178\nThanks for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.510\nAlways a pleasure to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.910\nMobile forensics what\nan interesting topic.\n\n12\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.146\nSo many things we can talk about.\n\n13\n00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.229\nSo many things today are so\nprevalent, so relevant to what we do,\n\n14\n00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:35.990\nboth in the security world and\njust in our everyday lives.\n\n15\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.120\nWhen you think about the number of mobile\ndevices that individually any of you\n\n16\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.530\nlistening to us now have.\n\n17\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.510\nWe have at least one, typically two, maybe\neven three depending on what we do for\n\n18\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910\na living and where we work.\n\n19\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.580\nI remember, for many,\nmany years, not now thankfully,\n\n20\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.950\nI no longer have the Batman\nutility belt of devices.\n\n21\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.660\nBut I remember for\na long time I had to carry two phones.\n\n22\n00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.730\nAnd I carried at least one pager\nalong the way there as well.\n\n23\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.346\nThat's really old school stuff.\n\n24\n00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most of you have\n\n25\n00:01:00.407 --> 00:01:01.203\nno idea what a pager is.\n\n26\n00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:04.600\nBut not only did I have a pager,\nI had a 1-800-Sky pager.\n\n27\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.490\nSo I had one of those fancy\ncool doctor-like pagers,\n\n28\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.260\nwhere you could actually send four\nlines of text to a 1800 number.\n\n29\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.180\nI'd get it anywhere in the world for\nyears.\n\n30\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.784\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n\n31\n00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.100\n&gt;&gt; When I was in the music business.\n\n32\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.970\nThat's what I did, or had for a long time.\n\n33\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810\nSo that, this is back when cell\nphones were not even happening and\n\n34\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.620\nthen when they first started happening\nI for a long time had a pager.\n\n35\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.839\nI was actually one of the last people\nin the world that had a pager probably.\n\n36\n00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:25.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I am one of the last people\n\n37\n00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:27.115\nin the world that uses a blackberry.\n\n38\n00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.657\nSo there you go, when you need old\ntechnology you know who to come see right?\n\n39\n00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.820\n[COUGH] So\nwhen we think about mobile devices and\n\n40\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.603\nmobile forensics we're thinking\nabout all these things.\n\n41\n00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:37.240\nNot pagers cuz those are way old.\n\n42\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.505\nYou don't think about those anymore.\n\n43\n00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:43.541\nBut we do think about phones certainly,\ntraditionally we think about laptops,\n\n44\n00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:48.145\ntablets, variety of different devices\nwhere we may think of them being.\n\n45\n00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:52.823\nAnd more and more today these are becoming\nour primary communication platforms,\n\n46\n00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:56.710\nprimary information management\nplatforms and mechanisms.\n\n47\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.190\nI know a lot of people that live\nliterally and do work on their phones and\n\n48\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.620\nalmost never use a computer, and\nif they do, it's probably a tablet.\n\n49\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.815\nSo between the two they are totally\nunwired from a traditional desktop\n\n50\n00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:11.816\ncorporate office thought\nprocess environment.\n\n51\n00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:15.538\nNot that they can't plug in the tablet,\nnot that they can't connect to a network,\n\n52\n00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:18.305\nbut that they're not bound by\nthose traditional borders.\n\n53\n00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.845\nAnd therefore,\nthose traditional thought processes.\n\n54\n00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:25.195\nAnd this opens up a lot of opportunities\nfor us, but also a lot of problems for us.\n\n55\n00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:29.095\nFrom the security professional IT\nprofessional side, we now have to really\n\n56\n00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:32.510\nfocus on what we call MDM,\ntraditionally mobile device management.\n\n57\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.230\nAnd focus on corporate owned but\npersonally enabled assets.\n\n58\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.654\nWhat we call COPE, C-O-P-E as an acronym.\n\n59\n00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:42.144\nThese ideas that we may be\nissuing devices to you or\n\n60\n00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:45.870\nyou may use your own\ndevice right either way.\n\n61\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.648\nBut you are putting corporate\ninformation on those devices, and\n\n62\n00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:51.842\nthere's a public private space that\nhas to be demarcated and maintained.\n\n63\n00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:55.746\nThis is one of the big issues we have on\nthe security side, it's one of the big\n\n64\n00:02:55.746 --> 00:03:00.144\nissues we have to explore and potentially\ntake notice of as a forensic investigator.\n\n65\n00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:03.668\nWhat kind of information is on the device,\nwhere is it gonna be found,\n\n66\n00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:05.522\nyou know there's removable media,\n\n67\n00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:09.340\nremovable storage mechanisms,\nsome may have only onboard storage.\n\n68\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.853\nSo for instance the key to finding\ncharacteristic between something like\n\n69\n00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:18.509\nan IOS based device, an Apple iPhone and\nmost other phones in market today is\n\n70\n00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.115\nthat the i devices have onboard\ncapability but no external capabilities.\n\n71\n00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.609\nYou can't add an SD card to an i\ndevice right, an Apple device.\n\n72\n00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.609\nAt least not currently, not the current\nversions we have in market,\n\n73\n00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.070\nmaybe in the future, who knows.\n\n74\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.510\nBut for now and since the very\nfirst generation of these devices,\n\n75\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.110\neverything has always been in an enclosed,\nkind of hermetically sealed shell,\n\n76\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.050\nin the sense that it’s\njust whatever is on board.\n\n77\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.855\nYou have 64 gigs of memory,\n128 gigs, whatever it is.\n\n78\n00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:43.575\n&gt;&gt; That’s it.\n\n79\n00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:45.107\n&gt;&gt; And that’s it, right, nothing else.\n\n80\n00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:50.219\nWhereas with Blackberry, with Android\ndevices overall, even with Windows Mobile\n\n81\n00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.550\nplatform devices, although there are not\nmany of those, but those that do exist.\n\n82\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.490\nThey traditionally do\nhave the opportunity for\n\n83\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.490\nyou to add SD card or cards, depending\non what you're doing, to the device.\n\n84\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.630\nAugmenting, adding and extending storage,\nand therefore adding, augmenting and\n\n85\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.580\nextending the possibilities for\nus to hide data.\n\n86\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.464\nWe've talked about steganography\nin prior conversations.\n\n87\n00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:15.385\nAnd just the issues associated with\nthat and to provide places for\n\n88\n00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.022\nus both legitimately\nto put information and\n\n89\n00:04:18.022 --> 00:04:21.026\nillegitimately for\nbad actors to act in that way.\n\n90\n00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:25.233\nI've talked to you in other shows,\nin other topic areas about stories from my\n\n91\n00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:29.128\ncheckered past, my checkered past,\nyou can see the thought process.\n\n92\n00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:29.987\nYou like how I did that?\n\n93\n00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:30.626\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:31.148\n&gt;&gt; That was cool, right?\n\n95\n00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:33.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So my past, with regards to being in\n\n96\n00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:37.479\nthe field doing this kind of work, for\ncustomers, as an auditor, as a forensics\n\n97\n00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.003\ninvestigator, as a pen tester,\nwhatever the case may be, whatever role.\n\n98\n00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:41.665\n&gt;&gt; As a pager user.\n\n99\n00:04:41.665 --> 00:04:43.069\n&gt;&gt; As a what?\n&gt;&gt; A pager user.\n\n100\n00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.241\n&gt;&gt; As a pager user?\n\n101\n00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.897\nYes, but that's [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam,\n\n102\n00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:48.955\nwe're not gonna have our pager\ncodes on the CHFI exam, are we?\n\n103\n00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:49.548\n&gt;&gt; No, no, we're not.\n\n104\n00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:51.603\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no but I can spell like,\n\n105\n00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:55.339\nI could write all sort of crazy stuff\nin pager language and turned it upside.\n\n106\n00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.392\nDid you ever do that with calculators?\n\n107\n00:04:57.392 --> 00:04:58.973\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah hello, [CROSSTALK].\n\n108\n00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:00.598\n&gt;&gt; Hello and all that kind of stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:02.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really the only\none I can remember right now.\n\n110\n00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:03.501\n&gt;&gt; There's a whole bunch, yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:05.149\nNow we just play video games.\n\n112\n00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:06.461\nIt's like Bubble Breaker instead.\n\n113\n00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some people will have no idea\nwhat we're talking about right now.\n\n114\n00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:09.871\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Or\nCandy Crush or whatever it is.\n\n115\n00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:11.151\nYou don't know Candy Crash?\n\n116\n00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:12.066\n&gt;&gt; I know Candy Crash.\n\n117\n00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:12.983\nWe've got Boom Beach.\n\n118\n00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:14.318\nI don't play those kind of games.\n\n119\n00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:16.831\n&gt;&gt; I don't know Boom Beach,\nI only Candy Crash,\n\n120\n00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:18.962\ncuz people in my life play Candy Crash.\n\n121\n00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:21.046\nI've heard that that's a game.\n\n122\n00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:22.821\nI don't play that personally,\nthat's not me.\n\n123\n00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.028\nBut if I did,\nthen I would know about it as well.\n\n124\n00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:27.106\nThis is our random aside,\nwe're digressing.\n\n125\n00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:29.970\nSo, let's back to what\nwe were talking about.\n\n126\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.800\nSo what I was suggesting is one of\nthe things I've talked about in prior\n\n127\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.045\ndiscussions is the fact that for\nyears, and I still do, I would,\n\n128\n00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.840\nalthough I can't do it as much now because\nI tell people this and they're like, no,\n\n129\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.930\nyou can't plug that in.\n\n130\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.300\nBut I would hide hacking tools and\nput hacking tools onto these devices and\n\n131\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.146\nbring them in to networks in order to be\nable to secret them in during a pen test.\n\n132\n00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:50.915\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Or put them on a SD card carry them\n\n133\n00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:54.802\nin on the device, and load the SD card\ninto another device on the inside,\n\n134\n00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:57.460\nwithout anybody being around and knowing.\n\n135\n00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.583\nRight I mean, this is just\nstuff you gotta think of today.\n\n136\n00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.038\nAnd as sneaky as hackers are as\ninvestigators we talked a lot\n\n137\n00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:07.594\nin prior episodes about the fact we have\nto think like hackers in order to be good\n\n138\n00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:11.025\nat Investigating and\nbe good at offensive defense right.\n\n139\n00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:14.331\nBeing able to proactively keep\nthe hackers away from our network.\n\n140\n00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.171\nThat is step one of what we have to do,\nbut\n\n141\n00:06:16.171 --> 00:06:19.260\nremember as forensic investigators\nwe are not involved with that,\n\n142\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.610\nthat's the general security mind set,\ngeneral security steps.\n\n143\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.260\nOur traditional job role is\naround incident response.\n\n144\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.349\nProactive is good, but\n\n145\n00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.675\nif proactive fails, that's where\nwe come in because we're reactive.\n\n146\n00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:34.767\nSo we're the opposite side of that coin\nbecause we're showing up after the fact\n\n147\n00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:37.883\nwhen whatever control mechanisms,\ncounter measures, and\n\n148\n00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:41.685\ndefense in depth enterprise security\nbased architectures have failed.\n\n149\n00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:45.755\nUnder the assault or the weight of\nthe assault that's in question and\n\n150\n00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:50.280\nwe now are being called in to figure\nout and unwrap whatever went wrong.\n\n151\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.270\nSo we are gonna be that reactive force,\nand\n\n152\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.610\nyou have to be clear about that in\nyour mind as a forensic investigator.\n\n153\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.360\nThere definitely is a pro-active role we\ncan play, we should be consulting with\n\n154\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.420\nsecurity professionals and talking about\nthings we see, lessons learned, right?\n\n155\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.260\nCalled from these investigations.\n\n156\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.980\nReported back into that mindset\nof the proactive security\n\n157\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.910\nprofessional on the Enterprise\nSecurity Architecture overall.\n\n158\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.390\nSo we can update and modify our behaviours\nand update and modify our controls and\n\n159\n00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.540\ncounter measures to try to offset these\nattacks so they don't keep recurring.\n\n160\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.450\nThat's definitely part of\nwhat we should be doing and\n\n161\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.560\nit is a very valuable part of what\nforensic investigators can contribute.\n\n162\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.160\nTowards the proactive stance that reduces\n\n163\n00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.622\nthe over all risks associated with\nmanaging and running a network today.\n\n164\n00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:35.930\nBut that's not our primary job,\n\n165\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.200\nour primary job is going to be to\nreactively deal with those issues so\n\n166\n00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.080\nwe can understand them and then as a by\nproduct, hey let's report that out.\n\n167\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.078\nSo when we think about mobile forensics,\nwe're just taking this mindset into a very\n\n168\n00:07:48.078 --> 00:07:51.234\nspecific, narrowly defined area\nof the corporate environment,\n\n169\n00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.741\nthe mobile device frontier\nthat we deal with today.\n\n170\n00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:57.227\nMobile forensics is used to recover\ndigital information, evidence,\n\n171\n00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.885\nwhatever the case may be from one or\nmore mobile devices, as we always say,\n\n172\n00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.932\nin a forensically sound manner, right.\n\n173\n00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.907\nSo it's just the idea\nof applying forensics.\n\n174\n00:08:04.907 --> 00:08:10.025\nTo the mobile platform, and then whatever\ncomes from that is what we're gonna do.\n\n175\n00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:13.333\nThere are different storage locations,\nthat, and I've already alluded to some of\n\n176\n00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:16.190\nthem, that we would think about\nwith regards to mobile devices.\n\n177\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.300\nInternal memory, internal phone memory,\ninternal storage, in other words,\n\n178\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.570\non the phone itself.\n\n179\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.662\nThings that are stored traditionally like\nwe would see in normal systems, in RAM or\n\n180\n00:08:25.662 --> 00:08:29.280\nROM, dynamic volatile memory,\nread only memory that's static.\n\n181\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.750\nYou will have the equivalent of a BIOS,\nthe equivalent of\n\n182\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.550\ninformation that is hard coded into\nthe phone, for instance on a SIM card.\n\n183\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.710\nYou have the SIM identifier, you have\nthe information that's stored about\n\n184\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.260\nthe configuration on the device, that's\nall stored in the equivalent of a ROM,\n\n185\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.262\nit's read only memory, it's not gonna be\nwiped out when we power down the device.\n\n186\n00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:53.220\nBut there's dynamic memory, RAM, just like\nthere is in every other computing device\n\n187\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.770\nin the world today, and what's stored\nin the dynamic areas of memory\n\n188\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.950\nis gonna disappear when we\npower off that device, right?\n\n189\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.840\nSo cache, data, temp data for the web.\n\n190\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.080\nYou were mentioning, we talk about.\n\n191\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Applications.\n\n192\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.001\n&gt;&gt; Applications, passwords.\n\n193\n00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:07.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Are gonna be stored perhaps sometimes\n\n194\n00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:10.320\nin a cache, but a lot of times\nwill be stored permanently, right?\n\n195\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.740\nSo that'll be written to\nthe onboard storage and\n\n196\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:18.850\nwhatever the storage mechanism is,\nSD cards, SSD hard drives, whatever it is.\n\n197\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.320\nWho knows, it depends on the device.\n\n198\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.893\nBut ultimately,\nthey're gonna be found there.\n\n199\n00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:24.667\nThe mobile phone's OS itself,\nthe operating environment,\n\n200\n00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.240\nis gonna be stored there.\n\n201\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.870\nThere may be flash memory.\n\n202\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.250\nAll these things are internal, right?\n\n203\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.710\nAnd then, all of that's gonna\nbe part of what we see there.\n\n204\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.550\nSo we can extract information\nfrom the internal memory,\n\n205\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.510\nthere are command sets that can be\naccessed, they vary by vendor, by OS.\n\n206\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.580\nBut remember,\nwe're talking about operating systems,\n\n207\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.190\nthey are smaller,\nthey are nowhere near as big.\n\n208\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.215\nAnd therefore their footprint is\nnot as large, their support for\n\n209\n00:09:47.215 --> 00:09:51.072\ncommands may be truncated compared to what\nwe would think of as a modern desktop OS.\n\n210\n00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:55.221\nBut these are command line or\nrather OS's that are command driven.\n\n211\n00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:59.600\nMeaning we have access to command line\nfunctions through some sort of shell.\n\n212\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.112\nWe don't traditionally\nsee that on the phone.\n\n213\n00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:03.379\nWe may need third party tools\nto hook up to the phone,\n\n214\n00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.760\nin order to interrogate the phone and\nget access to it.\n\n215\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.900\nWe may have to reboot it.\n\n216\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.590\nWe may have to go into a command\nsupervisory kind of mode,\n\n217\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.380\nkernel mode versus user mode, if you're\nfamiliar with that thought process.\n\n218\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.467\nThere's different ways to think of this,\nbut there is gonna be a command set for\n\n219\n00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:19.992\nevery OS that we can access and\n\n220\n00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:24.144\ncan generate information from as a result\nof interrogating the device that way.\n\n221\n00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:28.219\nWe may need a USB cable, may need\ninfrared, Bluetooth, however we connect.\n\n222\n00:10:28.219 --> 00:10:30.096\nMultiple ways to do that today.\n\n223\n00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.960\nBut keep in mind that there are ways to\nextract data from internal phone memory.\n\n224\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.420\nWhat about SIM card memory?\n\n225\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.546\nI just mentioned SIM card a minute ago,\nright so\n\n226\n00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:40.482\nthe data stored in the SIM card is\ngonna be equally valuable to us.\n\n227\n00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:44.474\nThere's quite a bit of data stored there,\npersonal information, so\n\n228\n00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:48.883\nthings like your phone number,\nunique identifier, some passwords maybe.\n\n229\n00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:51.300\nThe password for\nthe vendor that owns the phone.\n\n230\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.939\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat would be there.\n\n231\n00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:56.022\nAddress books, so\nall your contacts are stored there.\n\n232\n00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:59.316\nMessages, service-related information,\nwhat networks you're on,\n\n233\n00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:02.142\nwhat kind of plan you have,\nwhat kind of access you're given.\n\n234\n00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:04.137\nThose things are all going\nto be on the SIM card.\n\n235\n00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:07.910\nAnd the SIM card is traditionally a popped\nout or removable, not always, but\n\n236\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.127\ntypically, removable storage mechanism.\n\n237\n00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:12.378\nThink of it as essentially\na small SD card.\n\n238\n00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:13.694\nThat's really what it is,\n\n239\n00:11:13.694 --> 00:11:16.567\njust specifically designed to\nact in this particular way.\n\n240\n00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:18.439\nThere's also external memory.\n\n241\n00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:21.710\nThings like an SD card,\nmini SD card, micro SD.\n\n242\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.937\nThere's different versions of this.\n\n243\n00:11:22.937 --> 00:11:27.299\nBut it's a little small hard drive\nthat we plug in, right, in one form or\n\n244\n00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:31.965\nanother, and gives us some sort of\naugmented additional storage capacity.\n\n245\n00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:36.007\nPersonal information like video,\npictures, audio.\n\n246\n00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:37.890\nYou record a phone conversation.\n\n247\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.962\nYou watch something, stream a movie and\nload it on your phone.\n\n248\n00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:43.720\nThat stuff's gonna go into\nexternal memory, stored memory.\n\n249\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.890\nNow, in phones that have that,\nin phones that are gonna\n\n250\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.230\nonly have onboard internal memory,\nthen it's just being stored there.\n\n251\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.270\nBut it's stored somewhere where\nwe can access those files.\n\n252\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.333\nYou know, more and\nmore today we're seeing evidence,\n\n253\n00:11:56.333 --> 00:12:00.698\ncontinuing evidence of the fact that there\nare apps in all the major app stores,\n\n254\n00:12:00.698 --> 00:12:04.671\nthe iTunes Store, the Android Play Store,\nthe Windows Store, right,\n\n255\n00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:07.105\nall three major vendors with their stores.\n\n256\n00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:11.330\nThat malware is getting into all of\nthese despite the best efforts of these\n\n257\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.390\nparticular vendors to prevent it.\n\n258\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.860\nThere was recently in the last week or\nso a case where\n\n259\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.330\nAndroid malware had gotten into the Google\nPlay store, infected over 100,000 machines\n\n260\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.418\nbefore it was figured out, or 100,000\ndevices, before it was figured out.\n\n261\n00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:27.111\nLegitimate-looking application passed\nevery security test that Google has put in\n\n262\n00:12:27.111 --> 00:12:30.439\nplace, including the Google Bouncer\ntechnology that's relatively new,\n\n263\n00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:32.012\nthat's supposed to prevent this.\n\n264\n00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:34.263\nThe minute we see this particular\nkind of activity happen,\n\n265\n00:12:34.263 --> 00:12:36.072\nit's supposed to remove\nthe app immediately.\n\n266\n00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:38.100\nGot through every one of those screens.\n\n267\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.513\nWas able to be downloaded into and infect\nover 100,000 systems before we actually.\n\n268\n00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:46.790\nNot we, before Google ultimately figured\nit out and started to pull it back.\n\n269\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.769\nAnd that's becoming more and\nmore common today.\n\n270\n00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:53.254\nAnd so as a result, it's not just,\nhey I got this picture, and\n\n271\n00:12:53.254 --> 00:12:56.144\nI took this or that and we wanna see that.\n\n272\n00:12:56.144 --> 00:12:59.811\nA lot of times where we get into\ntrouble on these mobile platforms, is\n\n273\n00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:04.241\nusers unknowingly, unwittingly going out\nand accessing sites that can cause them\n\n274\n00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:08.790\nharm or by extension take over the device\nand use the device in a variety of ways.\n\n275\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.655\nSaw an interesting movie,\nI'm gonna ask you but\n\n276\n00:13:12.655 --> 00:13:15.689\nI just don't think probably should.\n\n277\n00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:17.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like talking to Taylor,\n\n278\n00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:19.055\nwhen I do the same thing\nwhen he's switching for us.\n\n279\n00:13:19.055 --> 00:13:20.261\n&gt;&gt; Talking to a wall over here.\n\n280\n00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:21.962\n&gt;&gt; Daniel and\nI have this ongoing thing with Taylor,\n\n281\n00:13:21.962 --> 00:13:23.186\ncuz always we'll mention movies.\n\n282\n00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:26.320\nYou see me and Daniel introduce shows,\nwe're always talking about old movies.\n\n283\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.742\nAnd we'll throw out a movie and\nTaylor, you can see Taylor's eyes.\n\n284\n00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:31.323\nHe doesn't have a clue what we're\ntalking about when you're watching him.\n\n285\n00:13:31.323 --> 00:13:34.491\nSo the most recent\ninstallment of the Bourne\n\n286\n00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:35.920\nseries,\n&gt;&gt; Jason Bourne?\n\n287\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.690\n&gt;&gt; Jason Bourne?\nProbably.\n\n288\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.720\n&gt;&gt; Did you see the most recent one?\n\n289\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.390\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; The one where they wind up in\n\n290\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:39.960\nLas Vegas.\n\n291\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.110\nI don't know if that rings a bell for\nyou or not.\n\n292\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.390\n&gt;&gt; More details.\n\n293\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.110\nLas Vegas.\n\n294\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Las Vegas is a pretty big detail.\n\n295\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.610\nYou'd remember that in the movie if you--\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't really remember it.\n\n296\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.430\n&gt;&gt; So the answer is no.\n\n297\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.140\nWe're gonna go with no,\nyou probably haven't seen the movie.\n\n298\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.831\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna go with no for\n500, Alex.\n\n299\n00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, good job,\n\n300\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.674\nI appreciate you stepping up there and\nadmitting that you haven't seen the movie.\n\n301\n00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:00.094\nSo in this movie, the reason I mention it,\n\n302\n00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:02.311\nI thought you might actually seen\nit cuz it's a more recent movie.\n\n303\n00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:04.807\nIf you haven't seen it from this\nperspective, it's actually really cool.\n\n304\n00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:05.655\nYou should take a look at it.\n\n305\n00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:09.135\nSo one of the things, kind of one of\nthe main plot points around it is,\n\n306\n00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:12.195\nthe ongoing things with him and\nwith the Bourne character but\n\n307\n00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:15.320\nthe technology that's being\nused is actually really cool.\n\n308\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.056\nThey have now this head\nof cyberwarfare and\n\n309\n00:14:18.056 --> 00:14:22.926\nstuff in the CIA department that this\nBourne character is associated with.\n\n310\n00:14:22.926 --> 00:14:24.671\nAnd so this woman, this character,\n\n311\n00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.952\nis doing all this crazy computer\nstuff in the beginning of the movie.\n\n312\n00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:31.771\nAnd at one point they're trying to\nget these files that Jason Bourne\n\n313\n00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:35.258\nis looking at on a computer in\nBerlin in the middle of nowhere.\n\n314\n00:14:35.258 --> 00:14:38.910\nAnd they go and they break through\nall the firewalls, so she hacks in.\n\n315\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.626\nAnd she says, there's a mobile phone in\nthe room, or there's a phone in the room,\n\n316\n00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:42.452\nthere's a mobile phone.\n\n317\n00:14:42.452 --> 00:14:45.412\nI can erase the files by\nleveraging the mobile phone.\n\n318\n00:14:45.412 --> 00:14:48.372\nLet me hack into the phone, and\nyou see her doing this, and\n\n319\n00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.712\nshe hacks into the phone.\n\n320\n00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:53.058\nAnd then through the phone they load\nessentially a piece of malware that\n\n321\n00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:56.197\nblows the computer's hard drive up and\neliminates all the files.\n\n322\n00:14:56.197 --> 00:15:00.560\nSo it's actually really cool technology\nand this is not stuff that's made up.\n\n323\n00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.490\nThis is not stuff the average\npeople can get access to.\n\n324\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.782\nBut these kind of technologies and\nthis kind of mechanism exist and\n\n325\n00:15:06.782 --> 00:15:08.681\nyou can do these kind of things today.\n\n326\n00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:12.070\nWe don't often think as a mobile\nphone as being an offensive weapon.\n\n327\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.665\nBut the reality is it can be\nturned into a listening device.\n\n328\n00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:17.290\nCan be turned into a monitoring device or\nrecording device.\n\n329\n00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.487\nYou can activate the microphone,\nvideo camera,\n\n330\n00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.005\nthe onboard recording capabilities.\n\n331\n00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.430\nThere's a lot of things\nthat could be done today.\n\n332\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.920\nLaptops and mobile devices in general\nthat have these capabilities can all\n\n333\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.070\nessentially be manipulated the same way.\n\n334\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.869\nFrom a forensic standpoint we\nhave to understand that and\n\n335\n00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:37.775\nknow that if the device has malware if\nit's been modified if it's been rooted,\n\n336\n00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.532\na term we often use to talk about root\nkits being introduced into the system.\n\n337\n00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:45.280\nThat there's telltale evidence that we may\nwanna look at that could indicate that\n\n338\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.980\nthere has been some sort of an issue.\n\n339\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.930\nAnd we have to think about that and\n\n340\n00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.410\nunderstand that because that is one of\nthe key areas that we're looking at or\n\n341\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.250\npotentially want to investigate and\nget knowledge of.\n\n342\n00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.590\nSo that's something just to consider,\n\n343\n00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.256\nbecause a lot of times it may be\nsomething that we just overlook.\n\n344\n00:16:00.256 --> 00:16:02.684\nIt's a cell phone, there doesn't appear to\nbe anything on there, it's probably okay.\n\n345\n00:16:02.684 --> 00:16:06.376\nWell, what if malware on that phone was\nused to actually execute the attack?\n\n346\n00:16:06.376 --> 00:16:08.228\nWe have to really be\nthinking like that more and\n\n347\n00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:09.851\nmore today as forensic investigators.\n\n348\n00:16:09.851 --> 00:16:11.060\nBecause more and more,\n\n349\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.120\nwe are finding that these mobile devices\nare actually the entry point, right?\n\n350\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.150\nThey are the pivot point where the attack\nhas actually gone, and as a result,\n\n351\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.580\nonce they are taken over,\nthey go far and wide.\n\n352\n00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.625\nWe allow them to be tethered, allow them\nto be hooked up, all sorts of stuff that\n\n353\n00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:28.065\nflies in the face of convention and\nthe logic, but is done anyway.\n\n354\n00:16:28.065 --> 00:16:30.860\nAnd as a result we we expose ourselves,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n355\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.710\nWhat is the mobile\ndevice forensic process?\n\n356\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.950\nWhat are the steps involved with\nengaging a mobile device forensics?\n\n357\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.550\nImportant for us to aware of this,\n\n358\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.610\njust like every other methodology\nthat we share with you.\n\n359\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.560\nIf you want to take a look here,\n\n360\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.290\nwe'll just put it on screen so\nyou can see it, real quick.\n\n361\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.080\nSo, you'll see right at the top here,\nour five step process\n\n362\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.460\nbefore we get into what\nare the components of a cellular network.\n\n363\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.060\nWe'll talk about those in just a minute.\n\n364\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.770\nBut the collection of evidence,\nso we start out around that.\n\n365\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.910\nI didn't put in, by the way,\nmake sure that we have the search warrant,\n\n366\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.470\nmake sure we have the authorization.\n\n367\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.050\nTalked about that in a lot of\nour episodes up until now.\n\n368\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.980\nI think you have a good sense of the fact\nthat's always gonna be important.\n\n369\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.880\nWe have to have the right to do that.\n\n370\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.233\nI'm not saying it's not important, just\npointing out that we can kind of safely\n\n371\n00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:13.600\nassume that that's gonna be part of that,\nand just reminding you of that.\n\n372\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.430\nCollection of evidence, documenting of the\nscene, and the preservation of evidence.\n\n373\n00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.450\nRemember, collection of evidence and\n\n374\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.390\npreservation of evidence,\ntwo distinctly different things, right?\n\n375\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.190\nWe collect by going around,\nfinding everything, and\n\n376\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.580\nmaking sure we know what's what.\n\n377\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.000\nWe're gonna document,\ntake our pictures, do all that.\n\n378\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.310\nPreserving is the idea of tagging and\nbagging.\n\n379\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.110\nAnd then taking it off\nto secure storage and\n\n380\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.230\nanalyzing it in the proper environment.\n\n381\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.230\nSo you wanna understand the logic of that.\n\n382\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.250\nImaging and profiling.\n\n383\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.840\nThat's where we're gonna forensically\ntake sound images of the system,\n\n384\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.210\nmake sure we're doing the bit\nstream copies that we need.\n\n385\n00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.270\nWrite blockers are used,\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n386\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.720\nwe've talked a lot about that technology\nand those things in prior discussions.\n\n387\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.290\nAnd making sure we understand the logic\nof how to be able to work with\n\n388\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.430\nthe forensically certified and\na copy that has integrity of the original,\n\n389\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.800\nleaving the original device and\nstorage intact.\n\n390\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.870\nModifying it in any way\nwould render it null and\n\n391\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.810\nvoid, we're no longer able to\nuse it as a point of evidence.\n\n392\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.340\nAnd we may blow our opportunity to be able\nto show and legitimately validate and\n\n393\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.350\nexplain what happened if we do that, so\nit's very important for us to know that.\n\n394\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.470\nAcquire the information,\nthat's where we go in and\n\n395\n00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.840\nwe start working on the copy\nto figure out what's there.\n\n396\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.550\nAnd then summarize and report,\nwe always end with summarizing and\n\n397\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.860\nreporting in one form or another.\n\n398\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.136\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware that and\nwe have a sense of that.\n\n399\n00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:27.890\nMethodology is very important,\nwe keep referring to them in almost every\n\n400\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.630\nset of episodes around any of\nthe show topics we've seen.\n\n401\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.230\nWe always have a statement that\nstarts out somewhere around\n\n402\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.860\na methodology with a series\nof numbered steps.\n\n403\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.710\nProbably a really big important point for\n\n404\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.120\nyou to pick up on with\nregards to exam preparation.\n\n405\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.770\nThinking about the logic of what\nthat methodology looks like.\n\n406\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.070\nBeing able to reproduce it if asked,\nbe able to apply it in scenarios if asked,\n\n407\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.760\nwhat am I doing at this\nstage in this environment,\n\n408\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.090\ndoes this particular steps make sense,\nam I here?\n\n409\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.930\nAm I there?\nThere's a lot of ways we can ask this\n\n410\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.590\nquestions, so you wanna make\nsure you are familiar with them.\n\n411\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.150\nWas that an errand hand motion or\n\n412\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.080\nwere you actually trying to ask me or\nsay that you wanted to ask questions.\n\n413\n00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam I was just curious\nas to what are some acceptable\n\n414\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.690\nways in which we can submit these reports?\n\n415\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.973\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, absolutely.\n\n416\n00:19:09.973 --> 00:19:12.883\nSo we we're talking in step five,\nthe last part of the methodology,\n\n417\n00:19:12.883 --> 00:19:15.908\nsaying we always wrap up, kinda\nthe very last thing we always wanna do.\n\n418\n00:19:15.908 --> 00:19:18.683\nPresent our reports or\nour findings of reports,\n\n419\n00:19:18.683 --> 00:19:20.720\nthat kind of thing in a report form.\n\n420\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.720\nAnd there's so many different\nways you could do this, right?\n\n421\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.882\nIt may be a verbal conversation\nwith an interested party, so\n\n422\n00:19:25.882 --> 00:19:28.634\nmaybe more informal is what\nI'm suggesting to you.\n\n423\n00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.820\nIt's not formal investigation but\n\n424\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.830\nperhaps an informal incident\nthat was just being addressed.\n\n425\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.240\nYou could just close it out and\nsay yep, this is kinda what we did.\n\n426\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.120\nMaybe there's a help desk ticket or\nservice desk ticket that's noted.\n\n427\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.615\nSo maybe there's a little\nbit of formality there.\n\n428\n00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:47.580\nMaybe it is more formal, maybe you write\nexecutive summary to be given to your\n\n429\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.495\nsenior leaders, perhaps there is a formal\ntechnical report that goes behind that.\n\n430\n00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:56.671\nThat is given to a law enforcement agency\nor is going to be given to auditors,\n\n431\n00:19:56.671 --> 00:20:00.575\nthird party entities or insurance company,\nfor instance, things like that.\n\n432\n00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.376\nSo maybe it is a more formal document,\nmaybe there is a set of PowerPoints that\n\n433\n00:20:04.376 --> 00:20:08.250\nare done, to be able to brief different\naudiences, for instance, hypothetically.\n\n434\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.810\nThere’s lots of different ways to do this,\nbut it really will depend,\n\n435\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.910\ncircumstantially, on the particular\naudiences involved, right?\n\n436\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.210\nThe thing we wanna think\nabout from a report and\n\n437\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.940\nhow do I report out standpoint is,\nwhat audience am I speaking to?\n\n438\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.965\nWhat’s the relevancy of\nthe information I’m providing to them?\n\n439\n00:20:25.965 --> 00:20:28.750\nAnd,or am I providing it in\na way that makes sense to them?\n\n440\n00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.551\nThat's probably the biggest\nover-arching or\n\n441\n00:20:30.551 --> 00:20:33.040\nkinda guiding factor we\nwant to think about there.\n\n442\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.730\nSo just cuz we've talked\nextensively in prior episodes\n\n443\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.335\nabout speaking to your audience and\nknowing your audience.\n\n444\n00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:40.990\nSo make sure your presenting\ninformation in a relevant way.\n\n445\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.830\nAnd that would be the most\nimportant thing to consider.\n\n446\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.896\nAnd based on that, you would then\nderive the thought process of ,okay,\n\n447\n00:20:47.896 --> 00:20:51.270\nsenior leaders in the company,\nC-level executives.\n\n448\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.360\nThey're going to want probably\na PowerPoint briefing with\n\n449\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.130\nmaybe minimal technical detail, but\nthe ability to ask questions and\n\n450\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.570\nbe given additional\ninformation as a followup.\n\n451\n00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.400\nWhereas the insurance company,\nthe auditors, are going to want much more\n\n452\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.170\ndetailed, technical information,\na pretty thorough investigative summary.\n\n453\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.605\nSo you're going to have to write\nout a pretty detailed report.\n\n454\n00:21:10.605 --> 00:21:12.668\nSo it will depend in that respect, right?\n\n455\n00:21:12.668 --> 00:21:14.580\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Or you can just give up and go home,\n\n456\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.050\nand say-\n&gt;&gt; Throw the papers at them,\n\n457\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.008\nand say you figure it out.\n\n458\n00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:19.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You, just yeah, whatever, right?\n\n459\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.280\nIt's your job.\n\n460\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.260\nI'm only here because you told me to be.\n\n461\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.976\nNo, we don't do that,\nthat's not appropriate.\n\n462\n00:21:23.976 --> 00:21:25.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go back to our list.\n\n463\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.810\nWe had another item up there\nthat was an interest to us.\n\n464\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.330\nWe can go full screen because I'm\nsitting on top of part of this.\n\n465\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.370\nWe wanted to talk about the components\nof a cellular network, what they are.\n\n466\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.030\nYeah, we all, I think without\nexception today, have one or\n\n467\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.040\nmore cell phones as I eluded to at\nthe beginning of our conversation.\n\n468\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.920\nWe use them as an extension of many\npeople's head and ear space today.\n\n469\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.400\nThey seem to be permanently bonded there.\n\n470\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.170\nAnd certainly a lot of people are using\nthem as part when one needs communication,\n\n471\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.870\nas we suggest as to we started out.\n\n472\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.391\nBoth from a work prospective,\ninteracting and creating productivity and\n\n473\n00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:00.552\ncommunicating, collaborating.\n\n474\n00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:03.625\nBut also just to communicate\naround average everyday things.\n\n475\n00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:04.532\nHey, where are you?\n\n476\n00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:08.949\nI'm sitting outside, come out so we can go\nor whatever just you do it all the time.\n\n477\n00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:11.450\nSo it's important to think about\nthe components of the cellular network.\n\n478\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.810\nWe often take them for granted.\n\n479\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.600\nPlug our phone in,\nturn it on after we charge it.\n\n480\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.110\nHook it up and\nwe just magically start communicating.\n\n481\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.211\nHow many of us really stop to think\nabout what is the infrastructure?\n\n482\n00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:24.126\nAnd all of the things that\ngo on behind it, right?\n\n483\n00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:26.960\nIt is essentially\na glorified walkie-talkie.\n\n484\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.520\nIt's a very smart radio.\n\n485\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.800\nWe're using a two-way radio network\nwhen we use cellular networks.\n\n486\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.580\nAnd we do have to think about the logic\nof that because that helps us both to\n\n487\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.400\nunderstand, as you can see on the screen,\n\n488\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.190\nwe'll go through here in just\na moment the key component parts.\n\n489\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.650\nBut also forensically\nwhere we can plug in and\n\n490\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.880\nexpect to find information as a result.\n\n491\n00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.653\nSo the mobile switching center, what's\ncalled the MSC, as you can see there,\n\n492\n00:22:47.653 --> 00:22:50.601\nthat's the switching center or\nsystem for the cell network.\n\n493\n00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:54.252\nThis would have been in the old\ntraditional analog phone systems,\n\n494\n00:22:54.252 --> 00:22:58.112\nthese would have been the switching\noffices and the central offices.\n\n495\n00:22:58.112 --> 00:23:02.857\nThe CO's that we would talk about, that\nwere used to be able to drive the phone\n\n496\n00:23:02.857 --> 00:23:06.840\ntraffic down the phone network\nthrough the analog systems.\n\n497\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.010\nIt is the same idea on the mobile side.\n\n498\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.730\nA base transceiver station,\nwhat's called a BTS,\n\n499\n00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.460\nradio transceiver equipment,\ncommunicating with the mobile phones.\n\n500\n00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.450\nThis is what allows the mobile\nphone to hookup and\n\n501\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.030\nultimately connect through the tower and\nsend its signal and\n\n502\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.060\nthen have it propagated across\nthe mobile switch network.\n\n503\n00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.190\nThe base station controller manages\nthe transceiver's equipment and\n\n504\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.470\ndoes the channel assignment.\n\n505\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.861\nThe BTS and the BSC and the BSS all\ntogether kind of form the thing that we\n\n506\n00:23:31.861 --> 00:23:34.915\nthink of when you drive by\non the side of the road or\n\n507\n00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:37.244\nin a building wherever you see them.\n\n508\n00:23:37.244 --> 00:23:40.444\nWhere you see the radio tower or\nthe cell tower,\n\n509\n00:23:40.444 --> 00:23:44.049\nyou see the [COUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; I was actually just gonna ask you about\n\n510\n00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:48.712\nthis, I have in my side but we already\nhave one so I'm kind of [LAUGH].\n\n511\n00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:50.670\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say see the antennas.\n\n512\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.550\nBut okay, go ahead, so\nI was struggling for the word.\n\n513\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.500\nBut you see the antennas right on\nthe tower which you don't often see\n\n514\n00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.541\na lot of wires going down in the tower,\nright?\n\n515\n00:23:57.541 --> 00:24:00.849\nIf you see them on the side of the road as\nopposed to up on the top of the building\n\n516\n00:24:00.849 --> 00:24:03.666\nwhere you really typically can't\nsee what's below the tower.\n\n517\n00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:06.291\nBut when you see them on the side of the\nroad if they're off kind of on their own\n\n518\n00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:08.221\nyou'd normally see there's\nlike a building, right,\n\n519\n00:24:08.221 --> 00:24:09.720\nat the base of the tower traditionally.\n\n520\n00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.048\nA lot of wires coming into it.\n\n521\n00:24:11.048 --> 00:24:14.650\nSmall little quonset hut kind\nof building typically, and\n\n522\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.390\ninside there's a lot of this gear.\n\n523\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.641\nThere's the backup power generator,\nthe UPS, the battery backup,\n\n524\n00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.752\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n525\n00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:23.825\nBut then there's all this other equipment\nthat's actually structured along\n\n526\n00:24:23.825 --> 00:24:24.470\nthese lines.\n\n527\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.330\nSo the random aside, what would that be?\n\n528\n00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.330\n&gt;&gt; So here in Florida, a lot of crazy\ndifferent things happen here in Florida.\n\n529\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:35.060\nBut in 2014, there is a gentleman\nwho you spoke about most people\n\n530\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.020\nusing their cellular devices\ntaking a lot of that head space.\n\n531\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.145\nHe didn't really jive with that whole\nconcept of people driving while being on\n\n532\n00:24:42.145 --> 00:24:42.965\ntheir phones.\n\n533\n00:24:42.965 --> 00:24:45.940\nSo he installed a jammer\non his vehicle and\n\n534\n00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.854\nwhen he would drive pass\none of these BSS's, BSS's.\n\n535\n00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:53.000\n&gt;&gt; It would blow out everybody\nconnected for two miles.\n\n536\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The FBI became involved, and\n\n537\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.336\nthey started noticing a correlation,\na pattern in time.\n\n538\n00:24:57.336 --> 00:24:59.759\nSo it was when this gentleman\nwas driving to and from work.\n\n539\n00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:00.520\n&gt;&gt; It's against the law.\n\n540\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.750\n&gt;&gt; It's totally against the law.\n\n541\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.101\nHe ended up having to pay\nthe FCC almost $50 million, and\n\n542\n00:25:05.101 --> 00:25:08.263\nthe company that sold him the jammer,\nthey were fined.\n\n543\n00:25:08.263 --> 00:25:09.199\n&gt;&gt; Well, they fined him,\nhe didn't pay that.\n\n544\n00:25:09.199 --> 00:25:12.025\nThey attempted to get it from him but.\n\n545\n00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:12.783\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know if they got it.\n\n546\n00:25:12.783 --> 00:25:14.710\n&gt;&gt; If he was walking around\nwith that kind of money,\n\n547\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.270\nhe wasn't driving to work, trust me.\n\n548\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.950\n&gt;&gt; So also the company who sold\nthe device as well, so yeah.\n\n549\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nbecause of the way he used it.\n\n550\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.260\nYeah, the case is actually\nan interesting one.\n\n551\n00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.400\nThe device itself is not illegal\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n552\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.375\nIt is illegal when you\nput it in your car and\n\n553\n00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:34.822\nmake it essentially a mobile disruptive\nforce as you move down the highway.\n\n554\n00:25:34.822 --> 00:25:37.599\nFrom a public safety standpoint, which\nis one of the key reasons they did this,\n\n555\n00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:38.890\nif you think about the logic of this.\n\n556\n00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:43.500\nHe was essentially creating roughly\na several hundred foot radius around his\n\n557\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.484\nvehicle that would be incapable of\nsending or receiving cell signals.\n\n558\n00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:50.511\nAnd when he would attach to or\ndrive by one of these towers and hit\n\n559\n00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:54.400\nthe infrastructure there, he would disrupt\nall the cell traffic in that tower,\n\n560\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.542\nwhich is usually about a two-mile radius.\n\n561\n00:25:56.542 --> 00:26:00.078\nCuz on average most of these towers will\naggregate traffic from about a two-mile\n\n562\n00:26:00.078 --> 00:26:03.094\nradius, so you're connecting within\nabout two miles of the tower,\n\n563\n00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:06.740\nand you're leapfrogging tower to\ntower through hand offs as you drive.\n\n564\n00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.110\nAnd so he was disrupting and\npropagating that disruption out around\n\n565\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.920\na rolling perimeter of about\ntwo miles as he moves down.\n\n566\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.620\nAnd from a public safety standpoint,\nsomebody needing to get on the phone and\n\n567\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.405\ntalk to\n&gt;&gt; Emergency services, or-\n\n568\n00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:21.251\n&gt;&gt; Emergency, 911,\n\n569\n00:26:21.251 --> 00:26:22.234\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n570\n00:26:22.234 --> 00:26:25.834\nThat was not possible within\nthe sphere of this disruptive area.\n\n571\n00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:29.195\nAnd that was really the main\nreason that they go after him.\n\n572\n00:26:29.195 --> 00:26:31.365\nI mean, yes, it could have been for\nother reasons.\n\n573\n00:26:31.365 --> 00:26:36.175\nThese days, potential terrorist activity\ncould be covered by doing stuff like this.\n\n574\n00:26:36.175 --> 00:26:37.485\nYou could be attacking the grid.\n\n575\n00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:40.525\nThere's all these reasons why I\ncould see they would go after him.\n\n576\n00:26:40.525 --> 00:26:43.885\nBut one of the main reasons is this\nidea of disruption of public safety.\n\n577\n00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:47.035\nAnd this is why you're not\nallowed to do this kind of stuff,\n\n578\n00:26:47.035 --> 00:26:51.198\nbecause you can literally without being\noverly dramatic, people could die.\n\n579\n00:26:51.198 --> 00:26:53.621\nNot because you directly\nare doing something but\n\n580\n00:26:53.621 --> 00:26:56.580\nindirectly as a result of\nnot being able to get help.\n\n581\n00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.290\nThey actually can die.\n\n582\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.642\nAnd this can actually overwhelm first\nresponder radio networks as well.\n\n583\n00:27:00.642 --> 00:27:02.258\nI mean, this is not just cell stuff.\n\n584\n00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:06.086\nThis is anything that this device in\ntheory is within the range to touch,\n\n585\n00:27:06.086 --> 00:27:10.700\ncan be overwhelmed because you're creating\nso much electromagnetic interference.\n\n586\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.370\nEssentially more of a stronger\nsignal than what the radios put out\n\n587\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.560\nthat you're overwhelming them and\npreventing them from broadcasting.\n\n588\n00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.140\nSo this could be seen as a direct\nthreat for lots and lots of reasons.\n\n589\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.520\nSo yeah, definitely that kind\nof stuff can be an issue.\n\n590\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.520\nAnd it's happened in several places,\nnot just here.\n\n591\n00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.319\nWe don't have a guaranteed lock on\nthe crazy kind of spooky behavior.\n\n592\n00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:28.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shucks.\n\n593\n00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:31.404\n&gt;&gt; As much as it may sound like that when\n\n594\n00:27:31.404 --> 00:27:34.120\nyou come to Florida.\nBut we are a nice place to visit,\n\n595\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.050\nbelieve it or not.\n\n596\n00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:36.897\nJust don't bring your cell jammer\nwith you and you'll be fine.\n\n597\n00:27:36.897 --> 00:27:38.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Other than that, it won't be a problem.\n\n598\n00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.790\nIf we go back to our list we\ncan finish talking about this.\n\n599\n00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.650\nSo I think if we go full screen, please?\n\n600\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.290\nWe were down around the BSC,\nthe BSS, you can see that there.\n\n601\n00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.149\nThe BSS is the base station subsystem\nthat manages the radio network and is\n\n602\n00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:57.406\ncontrolled by the MSC so its the on-site\nthing that's actually managing that.\n\n603\n00:27:57.406 --> 00:28:01.720\n&gt;&gt; It has the BSC and the base transceiver\nstation and the transcoder as well.\n\n604\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.336\nAll the different elements that would be\nin that little building that we talked\n\n605\n00:28:05.336 --> 00:28:08.400\nabout are strapped to the side of\nthe antenna on the top of the roof,\n\n606\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.310\nwherever it is,\nin some sort of protective enclosure.\n\n607\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.850\nThe Home Location Register,\nwhat's called the HLR,\n\n608\n00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.550\nis the database that is used at\nthe mobile switching center.\n\n609\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.168\nIt's the central repository with\nall the subscriber data and\n\n610\n00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:21.532\nservice information is found.\n\n611\n00:28:21.532 --> 00:28:26.956\nThat's what you often hear about the law\nenforcement agencies going after,\n\n612\n00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:30.306\nwhen they go out and\ntry to get the call records.\n\n613\n00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:33.039\nAnd they go out and serve a warrant,\neither a FISA warrant or\n\n614\n00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:35.937\nwhatever the warrant will be,\naround trying to get this data,\n\n615\n00:28:35.937 --> 00:28:39.572\nand tap into the phone systems and\nsee who's calling and what they're doing.\n\n616\n00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:43.270\nThey're trying to get access to the home\nlocation register at the mobile\n\n617\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.318\nswitching center.\n\n618\n00:28:44.318 --> 00:28:47.620\nThat's one of the places they go and\nthey try to pull information from.\n\n619\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.350\nAnd the visitor location register is also\nanother database used in conjunction\n\n620\n00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.290\nwith the HLR.\n\n621\n00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.590\nThat's for one for phones that are roaming\noutside of their service area.\n\n622\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.080\nSo if I take my phone and I'm normally\nbased in the United States, and\n\n623\n00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.190\nI go to another country and\nI hook up to their network.\n\n624\n00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.910\nI'll show up in their visitor\nlocation register instead of the home\n\n625\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.940\nlocation register,\nthe equivalent of that in their systems.\n\n626\n00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.840\nAnd you could actually\ntrack my usage overseas.\n\n627\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.600\nAnd again, this is how this stuff is done.\n\n628\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.160\nThis is where we're getting\nsome of this information from.\n\n629\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.860\nThat is separate, by the way, from us\ntapping into and listening into those\n\n630\n00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.210\nphone conversations in real time, which\nis also done legally or illegally today.\n\n631\n00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.282\nAnd it's separate from taking\nthose phone conversations and\n\n632\n00:29:27.282 --> 00:29:29.596\ndecoding them and\nbeing able to analyze them.\n\n633\n00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:32.818\nThat's separate from what we're talking\nabout here, but the repository of data\n\n634\n00:29:32.818 --> 00:29:36.284\naround who's connected, what they were\nsaying, rather, not what they're saying.\n\n635\n00:29:36.284 --> 00:29:39.385\nBut where they were sending from and\nsending to, how long they were online,\n\n636\n00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:41.479\nwho they were connected with,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n637\n00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:44.141\nThat's in the HLR and the VLR systems.\n\n638\n00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:44.885\nThey're databases.\n\n639\n00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:47.745\nWe can pull that out of the tables,\nand actually see that information.\n\n640\n00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:49.557\nSo we do wanna be aware of that and\n\n641\n00:29:49.557 --> 00:29:53.610\ndo make sure we are kind of\nthinking through the logic of that.\n\n642\n00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.100\nWe also have different cell network types.\n\n643\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.910\nWe have the components of the cellular\nnetwork, but we also have,\n\n644\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.300\nif you just bear with me here\na second as I remember how to scroll.\n\n645\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.487\nWe do have different cell networks as\nwell, and you'll see them right down here,\n\n646\n00:30:05.487 --> 00:30:06.329\ncell network types.\n\n647\n00:30:06.329 --> 00:30:10.013\nThere's quite a few of them, this is\nnot an exhaustive list, by the way, but\n\n648\n00:30:10.013 --> 00:30:10.990\ncommon ones today.\n\n649\n00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.960\nCode Division Multiple Access, CDMA.\n\n650\n00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.060\nEDGE, the Enhanced Data Rates for\nGSM Evolution.\n\n651\n00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.660\niDEN, small i, capital D-E-N.\n\n652\n00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.400\nGPRS, GSM, HSDPA, TDMA, UMTS, and UMA.\n\n653\n00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.744\nYou can see all of these there.\n\n654\n00:30:25.744 --> 00:30:28.429\nUMA is kind of interesting,\nUnlicensed Mobile Access.\n\n655\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.310\nWhat we use when we're able to be able\nto set up, almost the equivalent of\n\n656\n00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.888\na wireless network, but\nwe're not doing it on the mobile.\n\n657\n00:30:36.888 --> 00:30:41.019\nRadio networks, that we're doing stuff\nthat may not be covered by a provider,\n\n658\n00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:42.931\nnecessarily, or using services and\n\n659\n00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:46.401\nsystems in different ways than\nthey would traditionally be used.\n\n660\n00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:48.586\nYou may find some interesting\ninformation there,\n\n661\n00:30:48.586 --> 00:30:51.834\nsomebody sets up their own little system,\nand you're able to get into, and\n\n662\n00:30:51.834 --> 00:30:54.751\nyou'll see information in a building,\nthings like that, right?\n\n663\n00:30:54.751 --> 00:30:58.295\nSo radio networks inside a building,\nfor instance, may go over UMA,\n\n664\n00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:01.357\nif they're using just a very\nsmall radio network, maybe for\n\n665\n00:31:01.357 --> 00:31:05.370\nwalkie talkies inside the building,\nthat kind of stuff, you may see that.\n\n666\n00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.780\nBut these are different\ncell network types.\n\n667\n00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.682\nI get if you're taking the exam.\n\n668\n00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:13.940\nProbably a good idea for you to be aware\nof the components of the cell network,\n\n669\n00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.860\nthe six components we've\ntalked about up above,\n\n670\n00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.240\nthe different kinds of\ncellular networks that exist.\n\n671\n00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.440\nWouldn't get too detailed into\nthe parameters of all these networks.\n\n672\n00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.510\nYou're not gonna be ask about,\n\n673\n00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:26.320\nhey, what are the defining\ncharacteristics of IDEN versus GPRS.\n\n674\n00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.798\nBut if you saw a list of,\nlet's say, eight or\n\n675\n00:31:28.798 --> 00:31:32.255\nnine terms on one side of a page\nwith a drag and drop capability,\n\n676\n00:31:32.255 --> 00:31:35.669\nchoose all of the cellular network\ntypes that are in the list.\n\n677\n00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:38.630\nAnd you have some of these and you have\nothers that didn't belong there, right?\n\n678\n00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.550\nSome made up stuff or something like that.\n\n679\n00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.880\nYou would have to know which\none are cellular network types,\n\n680\n00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.460\nand obviously as a result be able\nto then ensure that you're able\n\n681\n00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.680\nto choose the appropriate ones, and\nyou'll put them in the right category.\n\n682\n00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.450\nThat would probably be the extent of\nthe kind of questions you may see there.\n\n683\n00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.652\nSo it's good to know when we\nare investigating these networks,\n\n684\n00:31:56.652 --> 00:31:59.439\nwe're not as concerned about\nthe type of cell network as\n\n685\n00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:02.901\nwe are about understanding the devices\nthat were connected to them.\n\n686\n00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:07.180\nAnd having direct physical access to\nthe device to get information from them.\n\n687\n00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.366\nAnd then on the provider side,\nbeing able to go in and\n\n688\n00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:12.797\nlook at the provider side of the equation\nto be able to understand what information\n\n689\n00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:14.610\nwill be resident in the provider network.\n\n690\n00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:19.140\nAnd we'll talk more about that as we come\nback in our next episode, I think, right?\n\n691\n00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.640\nAnd talk a bit more about things\nlike call detail records and\n\n692\n00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.000\nwhat's gonna be in those databases,\nwhat kind of stuff are we gonna see there?\n\n693\n00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.869\nWhat kind of information can we get\nfrom those provider networks from\n\n694\n00:32:27.869 --> 00:32:29.860\nan investigative standpoint?\n\n695\n00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, sounds like a plan.\n\n696\n00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.830\nWe've covered a lot here so\nfar with our mobile forensics,\n\n697\n00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.250\nbut as he had stated,\ncome back for a part two here.\n\n698\n00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.616\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n699\n00:32:38.616 --> 00:32:40.172\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n700\n00:32:40.172 --> 00:32:41.436\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n701\n00:32:41.436 --> 00:32:43.060\n&gt;&gt;

this episode we'll continue\ntalking about mobile forensics.\n\n6\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.820\nAnd back in studio with us\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.478\nThanks for joining us today Adam.\n\n8\n00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:25.120\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.840\nAlways glad to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.810\nNot quite the man I was in the prior\nepisode, I think I lost about two pounds,\n\n11\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.380\ncuz we are experiencing a heat\nwave here in the studio but.\n\n12\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.412\nBut I will do my best to buck up.\n\n13\n00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:35.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And continue to keep going.\n\n14\n00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.670\n&gt;&gt; I'll keep the fans over here waiting.\n\n15\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.635\n&gt;&gt; Get a paper towel ready.\n\n16\n00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:40.435\nGet a paper towel, you may have to mop\nme up by the time we get done here.\n\n17\n00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:40.963\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n18\n00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:43.620\n&gt;&gt; So we are gonna continue\ntalking about mobile forensics.\n\n19\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.110\nWe spoke about it in the last episode\nsome of the background information,\n\n20\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.820\nthe top processes around, what a cell\nnetwork look likes, how it's made up.\n\n21\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.079\nTalked about some of the common\ncell network types that we see.\n\n22\n00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.263\nWant to continue that conversation by\npicking up on the theme that we left off\n\n23\n00:00:57.263 --> 00:00:59.400\nwith this, we were exiting the episode.\n\n24\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.710\nI told you to remember and\n\n25\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.550\nthink about the fact that, we often\nsee two sides of the conversation.\n\n26\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.060\nThe client side, the end user side,\non the phone and the provider.\n\n27\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.180\nRight and we have to think about both,\n\n28\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110\nbecause there's gonna be valuable\ninformation in both systems or\n\n29\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.480\non the client phone, whatever that is,\nthe end user device.\n\n30\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.410\nAnd if we're talking about a cell network\nspecifically, and a cell phone call,\n\n31\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.120\nwe're talking about information that's\ngonna be at the service providers side,\n\n32\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.140\nor providers side.\n\n33\n00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350\nSo, don't forget there are two\nsides to every phone call, right.\n\n34\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.290\nAnd we have to think about the fact that\nthe service provider is gonna probably\n\n35\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.330\nhave a lot of valuable information for us.\n\n36\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.966\nNow, it's interesting today that\nalthough we do use cell networks and\n\n37\n00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.690\nwe use them traditionally.\n\n38\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.020\nLet's make a phone call over a cell\nnetwork, we also can use computers and\n\n39\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.860\nturn them into phones.\n\n40\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.600\nWe've been able to do this for\nsome time, right?\n\n41\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.330\nWe may have things that are essentially\nvoice over IP-based apps or applications.\n\n42\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.943\nThink Link, think Skype for Business,\nthink WhatsApp, think FaceTime,\n\n43\n00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:54.247\nright this kind of things.\n\n44\n00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.910\n&gt;&gt; MagicJack was one of the first\nmarketable ones that I can remember.\n\n45\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.000\nDo you remember that?\n\n46\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Well that was a piece of hardware,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.860\nSo, a piece of hardware that would\nallow you to essentially connect into\n\n48\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.150\na traditional phone system and turn it\ninto a voice over IP capable transmission.\n\n49\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.396\nIt's a funny story about magicJack.\n\n50\n00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I remember it.\n\n51\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100\nSo, it's a small world, right?\n\n52\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.040\nSo, I'm sitting on a plane.\n\n53\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.350\nI think I was coming back\n\n54\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.050\nI want to say I was in India,\nI was coming back from India.\n\n55\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.260\nSo it was probably one of my flights\ncoming back when I was in the US and\n\n56\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.020\nI get on the plane, sit down,\nsitting up in first class, right?\n\n57\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.270\nAnd sit down.\n\n58\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Fancy?\n\n59\n00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n[LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.929\n&gt;&gt; Hey, do the amount of travelling I\n\n61\n00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:36.740\ndo, okay.\n\n62\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.600\n&gt;&gt; You rack up those points.\n\n63\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.760\n&gt;&gt; You know there's a couple of\nthings you don't wanna skip on.\n\n64\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.790\nThey got to sit on a plane for\na long time.\n\n65\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.500\nAnd you know, all kidding aside,\nI travel a lot.\n\n66\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.890\nI don't normally do that, but\n\n67\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.870\nwhen I'm traveling with work specifically\nand I have to work when I'm on the plane\n\n68\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.320\nin order to do what I have to do to hit\nthe ground running when I get there.\n\n69\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.890\nI will normally do that because\nit's truly the only place\n\n70\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.360\nyou can work typically cuz there's power\nthere, you have all that stuff and\n\n71\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.480\nyou know the extra room and\nthe capabilities, so\n\n72\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.280\nI normally will do that when I have to\nactually get work done on the plane.\n\n73\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.190\nSo don't think ill of me,\njust because I said that.\n\n74\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.810\n&gt;&gt; No, that's okay, but did you see\nthe article that recently the US was\n\n75\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.480\ncontemplating banning carry-on laptops?\n\n76\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the same way they're\ndoing from the Middle East and\n\n77\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.400\nfrom certain countries because of the\nconcerns about terrorist activities with\n\n78\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.600\nlaptops and things like that, that they're\ngonna make you check them through.\n\n79\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.718\nAnd I'm just hoping, they're gonna come up\nwith a great way to give you the indemnity\n\n80\n00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:27.361\ninsurance, so when people start\nstealing laptops out of your luggage,\n\n81\n00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:30.060\nthat they're gonna pay for it,\ncuz that's just not gonna fly.\n\n82\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.360\nIt makes sense, but\nalso it makes no sense at all.\n\n83\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.222\nBut that's a whole separate conversation.\n\n84\n00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:35.664\n&gt;&gt; OK, sorry.\n[LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:36.164\n&gt;&gt; MagicJack.\n\n86\n00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:36.918\n&gt;&gt; Totally unrelated to what we're talking\n\n87\n00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:38.600\nabout.\nSo, it's just the story about magicJack.\n\n88\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440\nI'm sitting there, a very nice\ngentleman sits down next to me.\n\n89\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.090\nWe kinda get to talking a bit while we're\nworking, and you know he sees that I am\n\n90\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.990\nworking on computers, kind of as say, what\ndo you do, we will talked a little bit.\n\n91\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.470\nAnd so we start chatting like what do you\ndo, I do this, I work for this company,\n\n92\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.040\nthis is kind of what I specialize and\nnow what would you do.\n\n93\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.960\nYou know I got this crazy wacky idea, this\ncrazy wacky product trying to get people\n\n94\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.230\nto pay attention to, maybe you could\nlisten to me for five minutes and\n\n95\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.720\nmaybe you could help me to understand\nwhether it's gonna work or not.\n\n96\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.110\nTurns out it's the guy\nwho invented magicJack.\n\n97\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.850\nAnd who-\n&gt;&gt; Was that the product\n\n98\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.390\nhe was pitching you?\n\n99\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the guy, the gentleman who\nactually invented it, the guy behind it,\n\n100\n00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:14.939\nwinds up sitting on a plane next to\nme before it really became out and\n\n101\n00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.755\njust everybody knew about it,\nand when he was still looking,\n\n102\n00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:20.870\ntrying to get people to help him\nget up and running initially.\n\n103\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.940\nWe actually had a really interesting\nconversation about the idea, what it was.\n\n104\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.380\nAnd he said you know, maybe I could\nsend you one, you could start using it.\n\n105\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.230\nTook down my info, and\nsure enough like 2 weeks later,\n\n106\n00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.620\nI get a package out of the blue and\nhe sent me 2 of them.\n\n107\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.240\nI still have them to this day.\n\n108\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.450\nI have them today.\n\n109\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.920\nIt was just totally random but\nit was just so cool.\n\n110\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.620\nSince you mention that,\nI thought I would say.\n\n111\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He was one of the nicest guys I've\n\n112\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.630\never met by the way.\n\n113\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.090\nAlso, a very, very nice gentleman.\n\n114\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.730\nSo any way, with regards to that, not\nrelated to what we're talking about here.\n\n115\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.660\nBut you think about the fact that\nwe're using voice over IP software and\n\n116\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.170\nthe fact that we\nare converting our endpoint.\n\n117\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.680\nIt is could be a fixed desktop asset,\nit doesn't have to be a mobile asset.\n\n118\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.450\nBut we're converting it into,\nessentially, a phone.\n\n119\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.420\nAnd we are converting the traditional\nLAN capabilities of a local area network\n\n120\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.080\nout onto the WAN, and just, simply,\ntunneling, and sending that traffic down,\n\n121\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.050\nwith POS and all the stuff that happens,\nusing a software voice over IP capability.\n\n122\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.840\nWe are transmitting phone calls today\nover the Internet more and more.\n\n123\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.060\nAnd our forensic investigative\ncapabilities have to be able to attach\n\n124\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.760\nto that and understand that.\n\n125\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.510\nSo, harkening back to our networking 101\nOSI model conversations about what layer,\n\n126\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.230\nwhere the data is, how it's structured,\n\n127\n00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.770\nwhat kind of protocols, what we need to\ndo, and how we need to understand it.\n\n128\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.540\nMore so than ever before, right?\n\n129\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.450\nWhat's old is new again, as they say.\n\n130\n00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.360\nThat based knowledge that we need\nto have as IT professionals,\n\n131\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.240\nas network administrators,\nas security practitioners become so much\n\n132\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.000\nmore important when we start looking at\nthese kind of devices in this technology.\n\n133\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.790\nBecause without understanding that,\nit would be very difficult for\n\n134\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.580\nthe investigator to really have a good\nsense of how to manage this information,\n\n135\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.920\nhad to find it and\n\n136\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.470\nif it's not a traditional cellphone system\nwhere we go to the provider with a coder\n\n137\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.740\nand say, hey, give me all the CDRs or\nthe call detail records,\n\n138\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.620\nor the call data records depending on what\nthey are called by that particular vendor,\n\n139\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.380\nand I wanna access to the database, is\nwhat we talked about in the last episode.\n\n140\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.170\nThe visitor database and\na home records are looking.\n\n141\n00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.560\nThe home database and\nthe visitor database.\n\n142\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.300\nI don't have access to that stuff because\nthat's not being used for WhatsApp.\n\n143\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.975\nit's not being used for FaceTime,\ntotally different system.\n\n144\n00:06:25.975 --> 00:06:30.570\nSeems pieces of software transmitting\npackets over the network.\n\n145\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.740\nAnd as a result when looking at very\ndifferent kinds of investigator processes\n\n146\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.750\nin mobile forensics is coming more with\nNetwork forensics and OS forensics\n\n147\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.960\nmore and more today and Cloud forensics\nand those four things go into a blender.\n\n148\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.000\nWe've talked about every one of those\nthings by the way all along throughout our\n\n149\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.440\nconversations up until now.\n\n150\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.080\nThis being the mobile portion.\n\n151\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.620\nWe have to throw those four\nthings into the blender and\n\n152\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.480\nreally mixed them up and\nget them to become a new hybrid.\n\n153\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.500\nWhich is not just anyone of those\nthings but a combination of all of them\n\n154\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.040\nto better understand how these\ntechnologies are working today.\n\n155\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.110\nAnd we see more and more on\nthe terrorism side, on the security side\n\n156\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.520\nthat these devices and these communication\npathways that are being encrypted and\n\n157\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.470\nare being tunneled and used, are becoming\nharder and harder for us to follow\n\n158\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.260\nin many respects because we're just\nnot going to have access to the data.\n\n159\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.660\nNot the traditional people,\n\n160\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.030\ncertainly advanced law enforcement\ncapabilities at intelligence gathering\n\n161\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.010\nagencies at the government level\nthat may be a very different story.\n\n162\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.820\nBut for the average forensic\ninvestigator there's really no way for\n\n163\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.680\nus to get access to a lot of that traffic,\nespecially when it is encrypting and\n\n164\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.640\nself destructing right?\n\n165\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.149\nSo it's not just the voice traffic.\n\n166\n00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.947\nIt's a lot of the messaging traffic so\nthings like Vine and Snapchat that\n\n167\n00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:44.867\nare sending six to seven, maybe eight\nto ten second snippets of stuff, and\n\n168\n00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:48.664\nthen they're self destructing within\n30 seconds or whatever it is and\n\n169\n00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:51.927\nyou could set these options on\na lot of these platforms today.\n\n170\n00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:54.800\nOr they're designed specifically out\nof the box to work that way, right?\n\n171\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.747\nWhatever it is Those things, here today,\nliterally gone in an instant.\n\n172\n00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:03.080\nHow do you reproduce that data when it's\ntaken out of the system and is destroyed?\n\n173\n00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.590\nThere is remnant data, there are ways to\nget it back, but as an investigator to be\n\n174\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.770\nable to go get access to the pathways and\nthe servers that would allow us to do so\n\n175\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.610\nvery, very difficult if not impossible\nto do under normal conditions.\n\n176\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.170\nSo, there's a lot of subtlety here that\nwe unfortunately, are just not prepared\n\n177\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.710\nto deal with, and really understand\nhow to get over and address right now.\n\n178\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.110\nAnd this is an ongoing emerging area.\n\n179\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.030\nAnd it's changing literally\nas we're sitting here and\n\n180\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.470\ntalk about it with you today.\n\n181\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.610\nBecause these technologies\ncontinue to evolve.\n\n182\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.760\nSo it's a very interesting area that we\nspend time on and think about right now.\n\n183\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.690\nSo think about certainly that\nif we in traditional mode,\n\n184\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.810\nit's on a cellphone, delete messages from\nthe cellphone, are they really gone?\n\n185\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.030\nWe'll they're gone from the device but\nsort of try to get them back from remnant\n\n186\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.200\ndata on the memory device but\ndoes the provider have a record of that?\n\n187\n00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.480\nYeah, they probably do have the record\nof the messages, the text messages for\n\n188\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.500\ninstance, right?\n\n189\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.320\nThose things can actually\nbe brought back up.\n\n190\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.190\nSo if you delete them from your phone,\nthey're not really gone,\n\n191\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.670\nthey're sitting in the databases at\nthe provider for a period of time.\n\n192\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.877\nIf they haven't gotten rid of them,\nthen a court order and\n\n193\n00:09:02.877 --> 00:09:05.440\na discovery order can\nactually produce that.\n\n194\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.620\nYou see that a lot in the crime dramas and\nmovies, things like that.\n\n195\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.440\nI reference those opportunities for\n\n196\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.120\nyou to link to the real world through\nTV and movies wherever I can.\n\n197\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.495\nWe joke around a lot about them, but\nthere's a lot of real important stuff\n\n198\n00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:20.163\nthat you can link to that helps\nyou provide perspective and\n\n199\n00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:22.030\ncontext in those references, as well.\n\n200\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.093\nYou see a lot of this if you watch those\nkinds of shows where the police will get\n\n201\n00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:29.030\nthe device, yeah,\na burner phone wiped clean.\n\n202\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.000\nBut then they'll go pull what\nthey call the logs, right?\n\n203\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.485\nThe logs on the calls from the phone,\nand they go to the provider.\n\n204\n00:09:34.485 --> 00:09:36.850\nAnd they say, hey,\nwe need the text messages.\n\n205\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.120\nAnd they can reproduce the actual\ntranscription of conversations even though\n\n206\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.860\nit's been wiped from the phone,\nbecause it's resident in the servers.\n\n207\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.770\nWhatever the logging capabilities\nare of the provider.\n\n208\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.000\nSo, we do need to understand and\n\n209\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.930\nthink through the logic of that,\nbecause it does exist there.\n\n210\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.520\nWhat we're talking about are really\nthe CDRs, the call detail or\n\n211\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.610\ncall data records.\n\n212\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.900\nIf you join me here we'll take\na look at what they look like.\n\n213\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.840\nPlease go full screen so\nwe can see what's there.\n\n214\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.780\nAnd you'll see that we have quite\na bit of information that we capture\n\n215\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.430\nthrough the use of through the aggregation\nof the gathering of the CDRs right?\n\n216\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.080\nSo this is information about user\nactivities on the mobile phone,\n\n217\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.800\nthe service provider is\ngonna have this information\n\n218\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.180\nin those databases that we were talking\nabout, right, the home location database,\n\n219\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.240\nthe visitor database that we talked about.\n\n220\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.290\nAnd so when we get this,\nthere's a lot of stuff here.\n\n221\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.850\nCall the telephone number and numbers.\n\n222\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.655\nWho do we call?\n\n223\n00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:29.310\nSo hey, you didn't call this person.\n\n224\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.810\nYes, I did.\n\n225\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.080\nWell, there's a record of that, whether\nyou did or didn't do that and we can tell.\n\n226\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.050\nNames and addresses of subscribers and\nregistered users.\n\n227\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.760\nSo we can see not only who they are but\nwhatever information,\n\n228\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.330\nwhen we say address, it may not be\nthe actual, hey 123 Circle Street,\n\n229\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.970\nmore like the IP address of the endpoint\ntraditionally is what we'd find.\n\n230\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.470\nWe may find home information if\nyou're registered as a user for\n\n231\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.680\nbilling purposes, right?\n\n232\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.587\nWe may find that, but\nthat may be erroneous.\n\n233\n00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:54.432\nKeep in mind you may not have\ngiven your real address so\n\n234\n00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:56.800\nwe're talking about different\nkinds of information.\n\n235\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.840\nDate and time of the start and\n\n236\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.530\nend of the communication,\nhey I was on the phone for 20 minutes.\n\n237\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.200\nNo, you weren't we have a five second\nphone call when you hung up, right.\n\n238\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.750\nThat kind of thing if you're establishing\nan alibi or proving or disapproving it.\n\n239\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.870\nThe telephone service used was\na voice conference call, SMS texting,\n\n240\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.750\nmultimedia, streaming, things like that.\n\n241\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.728\n&gt;&gt; What's called the IMSI, the IMSI and\nthe IMEI, the international mobile\n\n242\n00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:24.060\nsubscriber identity and the international\nmobile equipment identity.\n\n243\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.760\nThese are unique tracking values\nthat inscribe every handset and\n\n244\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.470\nit can be used to identify you.\n\n245\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.610\nWe will talk more about a couple\nof those where they come from,\n\n246\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.710\nand how to get information\noff the SIM card and\n\n247\n00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.200\nthings like that, in the next couple\nof minutes of our conversation here.\n\n248\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.030\nThe location label, commonly called\nthe cell ID, at the start and\n\n249\n00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.250\nend of the communication.\n\n250\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.980\nThis is where we are and\nwhat cell tower we were on.\n\n251\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.940\nRemember, you've seen this\nprobably in things like NCIS,\n\n252\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.550\nif you watch NCIS, or\nany of those TV shows.\n\n253\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.260\nWhere they say, wait,\nhold on I can tell you where they are.\n\n254\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.770\nAnd they triangulate and\nlocate the cellphone when it's turned on.\n\n255\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.625\nDid they ping it to see\nif it's on the grid, and\n\n256\n00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.730\nfigure out what cell towers\nit's associated with.\n\n257\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.070\nAnd they actually try to find, law\nenforcement will then try and find you.\n\n258\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.960\nThe cell ID, the location label,\nis what we look at for that.\n\n259\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.400\nAnd we can see the hand-off\nbetween towers and\n\n260\n00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.720\nwhere you were all on the way with the\ndata mapping, excuse me, item number 8,\n\n261\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.050\nthe data mapping there between\nCell IDs and geographic location.\n\n262\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.005\nSo we can actually tell where you\nwere if you're in your car driving,\n\n263\n00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:23.580\nthen you're moving north\nright up the highway,\n\n264\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.540\nwe can tell where you were as you were\nhaving that conversation based on\n\n265\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.080\nthe number of cell towers you\nconnect to and where they are.\n\n266\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.590\nIf you're in a downtown office corridor or\nwhatever,\n\n267\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.970\nwe can tell that as well and\nyou'll see what's going on.\n\n268\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.910\nSo we actually can see and\n\n269\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.880\nfigure out all this stuff by\nlooking at the call detail record.\n\n270\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.910\nLot of stuff out there that's\nfloating around about you, right?\n\n271\n00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:45.510\nNext time you pick up that cellphone and\nturn it on, think about the fact that\n\n272\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.060\nthe we're gonna have a fairly\naccurate record of what you're doing,\n\n273\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.495\nwhere you are, who you doing it with.\n\n274\n00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:53.450\nWhat's your discussing,\nyou know the sense of the details.\n\n275\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.040\nNot perhaps the actual words used but\nsurely the structural and\n\n276\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.965\nset of information around the call.\n\n277\n00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:01.220\nWe'll be able tell all that and\nunderstand a lot of that.\n\n278\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.380\n&gt;&gt; For sure I remember\ndoing a report on the types\n\n279\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.684\nof information queries from service\nprovider and it's after 9/11,\n\n280\n00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:13.060\nand we saw that big change, a big\nshift in how information obtained but\n\n281\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.630\na lot of this service providers\nwere being inundated with so\n\n282\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.340\nmany queries that they had to go and kind\nof push back against some of those because\n\n283\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.770\nthey weren't having the resources to\nfulfill all of this information requests.\n\n284\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah in terms of government\nrequirements sort of polite requests often\n\n285\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.670\narm twisting behind the scenes, right,\nto get access to this data under files or\n\n286\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.200\norders or whatever the case may\nbe depending on what country and\n\n287\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.700\nwhat we're talking about, but yeah.\n\n288\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.475\nI'm really sure there's a lot of this data\nBut it's just been sitting out there.\n\n289\n00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:46.210\nThey may or may not be interrogated for\na variety of reasons.\n\n290\n00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.558\nA government certainly look in at a lot\nof this information to keep up with\n\n291\n00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:55.212\nthe things that are going on around\nthese kinds of investigations globally.\n\n292\n00:13:55.212 --> 00:13:58.104\nThere is no way that you can use\na cellphone today and send or\n\n293\n00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:01.471\nreceive information without there\nbeing a record of it somewhere,\n\n294\n00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:04.270\nbecause it's connected\nto multiple networks.\n\n295\n00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.340\nAnd there are electronic networks\nthat are designed specifically to\n\n296\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.910\ncapture this data, regardless of\nall steps taken to prevent that.\n\n297\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.930\nAnd you just have to\nunderstand the logic of that.\n\n298\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.010\nI'm not saying that means that anybody is\nlistening to your conversation, plucking\n\n299\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.940\nyour conversation out of the stream of\nconversations specifically and purposely\n\n300\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.260\nlistening in on it is not something\nthat's done unless you are up to no good,\n\n301\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.490\nor unless you have a reason to be doing\nsomething that people want to find you.\n\n302\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.100\nBut that doesn't mean it's not\nsitting in a database somewhere,\n\n303\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.630\nit doesn't mean it hasn't been recorded.\n\n304\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.970\nIt just means it's probably never\ngonna see the light of day and\n\n305\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.200\nnever be reproduced.\n\n306\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.530\nBut there's a record of it, right?\n\n307\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.000\nAnd we often talk about this.\n\n308\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.910\nYou don't want a record\nof what you're doing?\n\n309\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.540\nYou should prevent any kind of record\nbeing created by not using electronic\n\n310\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.860\ndevices of any kind.\n\n311\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.730\nBecause, reality is you plug anything\ninto what we would think of,\n\n312\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.850\nas a global network of any kind today.\n\n313\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.570\nSending and\nreceiving information in electronic form.\n\n314\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.820\nThere's gonna be a record of it somewhere.\n\n315\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.300\nSomebody is watching,\nsomebody's recording it.\n\n316\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.500\nThat somebody's probably a computer.\n\n317\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.830\nIt's probably not a human.\n\n318\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.750\nAnd it's probably an automated process.\n\n319\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.330\nAnd if you don't match certain\ncriteria on certain filters,\n\n320\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.630\nthat is just gonna fly under the radar and\neventually disappear.\n\n321\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.630\nBut there's a record of it.\n\n322\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.140\nAnd if you ever decide to\npop up on that radar for\n\n323\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.360\nsome reason, somebody's gonna go back and\nfind all those conversations.\n\n324\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.300\nThey exist.\n\n325\n00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.710\nEvery text you've ever sent.\n\n326\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.290\nEvery picture you've ever posted.\n\n327\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.380\nEverything you've ever said, is in\nsomeone's database in probably, multiple\n\n328\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.950\ncountries, around the world today, and\nit's been there since you said it, and\n\n329\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.500\nwill be there for hell of a long somebody\ndims it to be important to keep it.\n\n330\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.920\nThat's just the reality of\nthe world we're living today.\n\n331\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.118\nTry to impress this on my kids,\non a regular basis.\n\n332\n00:15:37.118 --> 00:15:41.880\nWhen you have young ones, younger than\nmine, but I tell them all the time.\n\n333\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.931\nMy wife tells them, too.\n\n334\n00:15:42.931 --> 00:15:45.664\nThe reality is everything you do today,\nyou don't think about it.\n\n335\n00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:47.073\n&gt;&gt; You're 16 years old, 15 years old.\n\n336\n00:15:47.073 --> 00:15:49.330\nYou're doing stupid\nstuff with your friends.\n\n337\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.917\nThat's gonna come back to haunt\nyou at some point right, and\n\n338\n00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.242\nwe see ample evidence of that.\n\n339\n00:15:53.242 --> 00:15:55.515\nAnd really it's a different world\nthan the world I grew up in,\n\n340\n00:15:55.515 --> 00:15:57.066\nthe world many of you\nmay have grown up in.\n\n341\n00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:01.860\nWhen I was 15 years old doing stupid\nstuff, I wasn't doing it on cell phones,\n\n342\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.140\nthey didn't exist when I was a kid.\n\n343\n00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.874\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not even just kids.\n&gt;&gt; It was a very different world?\n\n344\n00:16:05.874 --> 00:16:07.426\n&gt;&gt; It's not even just kids nowadays,\nyou see-\n\n345\n00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:08.972\n&gt;&gt; Listen adults are quite stupid\n\n346\n00:16:08.972 --> 00:16:09.688\non their own.\n\n347\n00:16:09.688 --> 00:16:13.408\n&gt;&gt; A comedian with a photo just recently--\n&gt;&gt; Without getting in to politics,\n\n348\n00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:14.618\njust generically, right.\n\n349\n00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:17.138\n&gt;&gt; People put things out there.\n\n350\n00:16:17.138 --> 00:16:19.324\n&gt;&gt; It's just look,\nthere's all sorts of stuff,\n\n351\n00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:23.350\nwe all do things that we on hindsight,\nright, probably would think better of.\n\n352\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.230\nBut my point is, it's just become so\nmuch easier to propagate that today, and\n\n353\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.320\nas a result, as investigators,\nwe need to understand that\n\n354\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.690\nthere's a value to us as investigators\nbecause we do have access to information.\n\n355\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.610\nBut we have to also understand,\nas the people that are generating that\n\n356\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.960\ninformation, that there are some\ndark sides of those technologies,\n\n357\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.900\nand we have to equally be aware of both.\n\n358\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.870\nSo some of the things that get covered or\nrecovered that we can find here based on\n\n359\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.490\nthis, right, call history,\nSIM card information,\n\n360\n00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.910\nwe're gonna get into SIM cards talk\nabout what they are in a minute.\n\n361\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.850\nPhone book information who you talk to,\ncontacts, things like that, subscriber and\n\n362\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.820\nequipment IDs as I pointed out to you.\n\n363\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.810\nSMS information,\n\n364\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.050\nlet me be clearer, that means\nthe actual texts you are sending right.\n\n365\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.900\nThis has gotten lots of people into\ntrouble over the years, right,\n\n366\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.530\nI didn't send that.\n\n367\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.670\nYes you did, we have a record of it\nright here, right, so that kinda stuff.\n\n368\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.274\nGPS, and Internet settings,\nco-location and geography, photos, videos,\n\n369\n00:17:11.274 --> 00:17:13.570\nall that kind of stuff can be pulled down.\n\n370\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.340\nWeb browsing history, people often forget\nwe have web browsers on these devices\n\n371\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.170\ntoday, just like we do on the desktop,\n\n372\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:25.090\nand application variety\noperating systems that we use.\n\n373\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.410\nYou have Google, you have IE, whatever it\nis on any of the devices that you use,\n\n374\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.960\nit's a web browser, works the same way.\n\n375\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.120\nJust because the screen is a third the\nsize doesn't mean that it's any more or\n\n376\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.282\nany less important.\n\n377\n00:17:36.282 --> 00:17:38.231\nEmail, all this kinda\nstuff is gonna come up and\n\n378\n00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:40.298\ncertainly be something we\nhave to think of right.\n\n379\n00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:44.070\nSo when we think about being\nable to get into SIM cards,\n\n380\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:49.480\nsubscriber identity module is what SIM\ndiscusses or is made to reference.\n\n381\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.560\nWe have to think about the fact that the\nSIM card is this onboard control center.\n\n382\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.290\nIt's this card that is acting as a storage\nmedium and a configuration medium.\n\n383\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.460\nIt tells us how to configure the device,\nhow to set up the settings,\n\n384\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.750\nconnect to the provider network,\nthings like that.\n\n385\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.140\nAuthenticating the user of the cell phone\nto the network, giving them access, and\n\n386\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.840\nallowing them to use this broad service.\n\n387\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.760\nThat's what it does, has its own file\nsystem that's in nonvolatile memory, so,\n\n388\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.320\nit's got its own operating system, or\nrather its own file system to store data.\n\n389\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.180\nAnd that file system is hierarchical, and\nit's made up of three distinct parts,\n\n390\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.750\nif you just bear with me here one second,\nI will be happy to show them to you.\n\n391\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.600\nCan we go full screen, cuz I am sitting\non top of them, thank you very much.\n\n392\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.650\nYou'll see it right here, so\nthree distinct parts, the Master File,\n\n393\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.880\nthe Dedicated File, the Elementary File.\n\n394\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.790\nThese are the three parts that make\nup the file system of the SIM card.\n\n395\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.680\nThe Master File is the root\nof the file system, one or\n\n396\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.920\nmore DFs, Dedicated Files, within it.\n\n397\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.030\nIt has one or more EFs as well,\nElementary Files, typically,\n\n398\n00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:50.460\nwe have a 2-byte file identifier that's\ngonna be of type right here, 3F00, right.\n\n399\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.570\nIdentifies the Master File and\nit's completely reserved, right, and\n\n400\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.370\nused for just the structural\ninformation that has to be maintained,\n\n401\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.150\nthat's what the Master File is for.\n\n402\n00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.005\nThen we have Dedicated File, Dedicated\nFile has only the header that holds\n\n403\n00:19:04.005 --> 00:19:07.975\ninformation, as you see here, related to\nfile structure and security information.\n\n404\n00:19:07.975 --> 00:19:10.855\nThere's a 2-byte identifier\nthat helps us to understand and\n\n405\n00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:12.945\nidentify uniquely the Dedicated File.\n\n406\n00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:15.595\nAnd then the Elementary File\nis the header in the body,\n\n407\n00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:18.405\nwhich actually has data in\na variety of different forms.\n\n408\n00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:21.885\nThat's where we actually see the stuff\nthat becomes real important for\n\n409\n00:19:21.885 --> 00:19:25.590\nus, this has unique serial numbers for\nthe individual SIM card.\n\n410\n00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:33.320\nVarious types of data for setting up and\nbeing able to construct the information.\n\n411\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.290\nThis is very similar to\nthe session area of the OSI model,\n\n412\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:42.030\nright, the layer where we structure and\nmanage and set up the rules associated\n\n413\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.700\nwith management of the exchange of\ninformation lower down in the model.\n\n414\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.360\nAnd these files help us to layout and\nunderstand the logic of how to structure\n\n415\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.900\nthe data that's gonna\nbe used in the phone.\n\n416\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.420\nAnd how to connect the phone and\nto control it, and\n\n417\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.720\nthat's what the SIM file or\nthe SIM file hierarchy and\n\n418\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.670\nthe set of files that make it\nup are going to provide for us.\n\n419\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.720\nAnd we can then go in and\nwe can acquire data from the SIM card,\n\n420\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.620\nmulti step process, not too difficult\nto do, you'll see it right here.\n\n421\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.798\nWe can go in and\nwe can access the SIM, the PIN code,\n\n422\n00:20:11.798 --> 00:20:14.680\nthe PIN is just personal\nidentification number.\n\n423\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.272\nWe may have to provide that,\nright, put that in,\n\n424\n00:20:17.272 --> 00:20:19.722\nremember if we do that multiple times and\n\n425\n00:20:19.722 --> 00:20:23.480\nwe don't get it right, depending on the\nnumber of attempts, we may get locked out.\n\n426\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.570\nTypically on a SIM card, three\nattempts before we block the card out,\n\n427\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.230\nthis is not the same as\nlogging into your phone.\n\n428\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.960\nThis is different, right,\nthis is getting into the SIM card itself,\n\n429\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.420\nthe SIM card is popped out,\nit looks just like an SD card.\n\n430\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.430\nYou pop it out, typically most of them\nanyway, can be popped out of phones\n\n431\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.180\nif it's not soldered in and\nactually wired into the phone.\n\n432\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.600\nYou can pop it out the back,\ndrop it into a meter, and\n\n433\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.510\nyou can start to hack away at it and\ntry to get access to it, right.\n\n434\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:52.140\nSo getting into the SIM card is the idea\nof what we're talking about here,\n\n435\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.740\nand there's a PIN code\nthat's required to get in.\n\n436\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.642\nAnd if you don't enter that properly\nwere gonna lock you out, so\n\n437\n00:20:57.642 --> 00:21:01.084\nfailure to enter the valid PIN,\ntypically with three attempts, will block\n\n438\n00:21:01.084 --> 00:21:04.417\nthe card and then you need what's\ncalled the eight-digit PUK, the PUK,\n\n439\n00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:07.805\nthe Personal Unlock Number that has to\nbe entered to actually gain access or\n\n440\n00:21:07.805 --> 00:21:09.910\nthe system,\nthe card itself stays lock out.\n\n441\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.290\nIf you don't get the PUK correct in ten\nattempts we disable the SIM permanently.\n\n442\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.320\nThis is just industry standard, this is\nthe way it works, this is not you're gonna\n\n443\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.820\nset this up and say okay,\nI want my PUK to go out after five.\n\n444\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.280\nThis is the way SIM cards are designed,\nso hacking into a SIM card,\n\n445\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.110\nit's a very narrow window for you to\nget in here and manipulate information.\n\n446\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.430\nIf you don't get it right,\n\n447\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.810\nyou're gonna run into a problem\ncause you're gonna get locked out.\n\n448\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.600\nSo, we do need to understand that and be\naware of that, the investigator needs to\n\n449\n00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.710\nask the network operator for the PUK,\nright, to potentially gain access to it.\n\n450\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.100\nMeaning, the cell provider,\nwhen we see the network operator there,\n\n451\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.150\nbecause the cell provider\nis gonna have that code and\n\n452\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.575\nbe able to tell you what\nit is to get to get in.\n\n453\n00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:52.815\nRemember, the SIM card belongs to them,\nthey're the ones that own it,\n\n454\n00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:53.675\nthey configure it.\n\n455\n00:21:53.675 --> 00:21:57.375\nAs a result, they have access to\nit behind the scenes, so that PUK,\n\n456\n00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:00.765\nthat personal lock number, is a unique\nnumber programmed into every card that\n\n457\n00:22:00.765 --> 00:22:06.333\nthe cell provider can provide under\ncourt order to unlock the SIM card.\n\n458\n00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:09.455\nYou hacking away at it with\na random generator is probably not\n\n459\n00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:12.520\nthe way to go because you'll\ndisable the card before you get in.\n\n460\n00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.520\nThink about the logic of randomly\nguessing an eight digit key,\n\n461\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.290\nI may be able to get the right one.\n\n462\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.787\nThere's really no good way you're\ngonna do that in ten attempts,\n\n463\n00:22:19.787 --> 00:22:21.000\nthat's just not gonna happen.\n\n464\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.406\nThis is one of the issues that, although\nnot directly related to it, but indirectly\n\n465\n00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:29.576\nrelated to it, this is one of the issues\nthat the FBI ran into a couple years ago.\n\n466\n00:22:29.576 --> 00:22:33.195\nWhere they tried to hack into the iPhones\nof the people that carried out that attack\n\n467\n00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.657\nout in California that were worried about\nthe fact that if they did this too many\n\n468\n00:22:36.657 --> 00:22:39.382\ntimes and didn't enter the right\ncodes they would lock out and\n\n469\n00:22:39.382 --> 00:22:42.446\nultimately destroy any access to\nevidence that may be in the system.\n\n470\n00:22:42.446 --> 00:22:44.766\nWhich is why they ultimately\nhad to go around and\n\n471\n00:22:44.766 --> 00:22:48.500\nhack into the system from a different\nperspective to gain access.\n\n472\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.230\nSo this is the kinda thing\nthat we think about, so\n\n473\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.310\nas an investigator we need to know that\nwe can get into the sim card but we do\n\n474\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.090\nneed to know that there are limitations\nand we may need to get some extra help.\n\n475\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.970\nWe may also wanna talk about the ICCI\nthe ICC ID or the integrated circuit\n\n476\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.700\ncard identifier, right, so\nthat's right here, and how we get in.\n\n477\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.870\nJust kinda walking down the ICC ID of\nthe SIM can be up to 20 digits long,\n\n478\n00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.960\nas you can see there\nright down at the bottom.\n\n479\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.548\nThis is going to have the industry\nidentifier prefix, so we're gonna have\n\n480\n00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:24.735\nkinda of an internationally agreed upon\nstandard way of putting your stuff in.\n\n481\n00:23:24.735 --> 00:23:27.500\n89 is the telecommunication's prefix,\n\n482\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.017\nthere's a country code associated\nwith it an issuer identifier number.\n\n483\n00:23:31.017 --> 00:23:34.210\nAnd an individual account\nidentifier number as you can see,\n\n484\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.219\nall of this is gonna be part of that ID.\n\n485\n00:23:36.219 --> 00:23:40.642\nSo we're gonna have all that, this help us\nto identify the country, point of origin,\n\n486\n00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:44.150\nand the cell provider and\nnetwork that the phone is linked too.\n\n487\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.527\nA lot of times we'll find a random\ncell phone at a crime scene,\n\n488\n00:23:46.527 --> 00:23:47.871\nwe don't know who it belongs too.\n\n489\n00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:51.174\nWe don't know who was using it,\nwe don't know what network it's on, and\n\n490\n00:23:51.174 --> 00:23:54.851\nwe don't have a way of knowing that unless\nwe get information out of the system that\n\n491\n00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:56.420\nhelps us to identify that.\n\n492\n00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.820\nMaybe it's somebody that came\ninto the country with that phone,\n\n493\n00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.570\nand that phone doesn't belong\ninside of country XYZ,\n\n494\n00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.280\nit's from a foreign national,\nwe'd have to figure that out.\n\n495\n00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.910\nSo we have to know that,\nif the ICCID does not exist on the SIM,\n\n496\n00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.550\nyou can get it by using a tool\ncalled the USIM acquisition.\n\n497\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.110\nIt can be done through tools\nlike the forensics SM Toolkit.\n\n498\n00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.640\nThere are many of them out there,\nthis is one of the more common ones.\n\n499\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.960\nWe could actually pull it out and\nactually find it but\n\n500\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.020\nwe have to use tools\nthat will let us do this.\n\n501\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.080\nSo this is another thing that\nwe can go after and look at.\n\n502\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.450\nWe also could go after the IMEI.\n\n503\n00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.630\nI mentioned that a moment ago,\nInternational Mobile Equipment Identifier.\n\n504\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.970\nAnd we could do that right here.\n\n505\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.960\nThe IMEI is gonna be a 15-digit\nnumbers you could see there,\n\n506\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.880\nindicating manufacturer, model type and\ncountry for the GSM device.\n\n507\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.630\nAgain, gives us information triangulating,\nlocating, and\n\n508\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.200\nnarrowing down where\nthe cellphone came from.\n\n509\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.240\nCellphones that come from another\ncountry are gonna have different IMEIs\n\n510\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.490\nthan cellphones native to that country.\n\n511\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.460\nAnd the first eight digits known as\nwhat are commonly known as the TAC or\n\n512\n00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.470\nType Allocation Code,\ngive us the model and origin and for\n\n513\n00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.200\npowered on GSM under UMTS phones.\n\n514\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.040\nThe international mobile\nidentifier can be obtained if\n\n515\n00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.330\nyou punch an *#06* or\n*#06# at the bottom here.\n\n516\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.500\nYou can actually get that from\nthe phone if it's powered on.\n\n517\n00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.720\nIf it's not, obviously, you get it by\ninterrogating the system separately.\n\n518\n00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.290\nBut we can't actually go in and\n\n519\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.380\ngo after this data and\nwe can get this information as well.\n\n520\n00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.968\nAgain, individual pieces of information\nmay or may not be valuable on their own.\n\n521\n00:25:29.968 --> 00:25:35.150\nBut the ICCID and the IMEI together,\nhelp us uniquely and\n\n522\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.270\nspecifically identify country of origin,\ntype of phone.\n\n523\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.280\nAnd therefore, we can then know\nwhat provider we have to go back to\n\n524\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.180\nto obtain records.\n\n525\n00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.740\nWhich will be very important\ncuz if the provider\n\n526\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.450\nis in a country that we're not resident\nin, then we have to deal with the laws and\n\n527\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.500\nthe legalities associated\nof making a request there.\n\n528\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.800\nAnd that would have to be done\ntypically through law enforcement.\n\n529\n00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.110\nAnd there may or\nmay not be a mechanism to do that.\n\n530\n00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.150\nRight?\nSo there may be a treaty,\n\n531\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.490\ndifferent things may or\nmay not be in place, hard to say,\n\n532\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.910\nbut we just have to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n533\n00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.838\nAnd finally, we have what's known as\nthe ESM, the Electronic Serial Number.\n\n534\n00:26:04.838 --> 00:26:08.695\nAnd the ESN is also unique identifier.\n\n535\n00:26:08.695 --> 00:26:11.835\nYou could see there a 32-bit\nidentifier recorded\n\n536\n00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:15.505\non to a secured chip in the mobile\nphone by the manufacturers you can see.\n\n537\n00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:18.355\nThe first 8 to 14 bits\nidentify the manufacturer.\n\n538\n00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:20.475\nMany bits identify\nthe assigned serial number.\n\n539\n00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:22.425\nThis is essential like a MAC address,\nright?\n\n540\n00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:26.435\nBut it's a MAC address for the device\nwith the manufacturer portion of the and\n\n541\n00:26:26.435 --> 00:26:28.285\nthen the unique identifier,\nthe serial number, for\n\n542\n00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:31.570\nthe device uniquely identifying\nit within the manufacturer pool.\n\n543\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.630\nIt's the equivalent of a MAC address\non a system with an IP address.\n\n544\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.440\nThe first three parts of the MAC address,\n\n545\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.920\nthe first six digits\nare representing the manufacturer,\n\n546\n00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.910\nlast six represent the unique instance of\nthat manufactured network card or device,\n\n547\n00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.940\nwhatever it is inside\nthe manufacturer's pool, or their ID.\n\n548\n00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.040\nThe ESM is the same thing.\n\n549\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.320\nIt's just the MAC address\nequivalent on a mobile phone.\n\n550\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if we, even if we are using\na device like a burner phone per se,\n\n551\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.650\nlooking at these individual pieces and\nlike you had noted, Adam,\n\n552\n00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.400\nall this electronic information\nis stored somewhere and\n\n553\n00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.460\nwe can even narrow it back down to that\nprovider and perhaps get some information.\n\n554\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.892\nThat's pertinent to sharing our\ninvestigation, so thank you for\n\n555\n00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:08.942\nsharing that with us today.\n\n556\n00:27:08.942 --> 00:27:11.058\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\n\n557\n00:27:11.058 --> 00:27:14.210\nbut we're not finished here\nwith our CHFI V9 Series.\n\n558\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.860\nStay tuned for more information.\n\n559\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.260\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n560\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.490\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n561\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.270\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n562\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.449\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.977\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:17.002\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your CHFI v9 series,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.011\nIn this episode we are taking a look at\nsome hands on demonstration of our mobile\n\n6\n00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.270\nforensics.\n\n7\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.030\nWith us back in studio today\nwe have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.440\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.740\n&gt;&gt; It is going swimmingly well\nnot just because we had rain but\n\n10\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.465\nbecause it is swimmingly good and we\nare able to go in and show you how to use.\n\n11\n00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.845\nUse some of the tools we've\nbeen talking about and\n\n12\n00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.325\nthe techniques so\nwe're going to jump right in.\n\n13\n00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.415\nWe're going to take a look at some of the\nthings you can do with a mobile platform,\n\n14\n00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.675\nhow we can clone sim cards,\nhow we can look at forensic investigation,\n\n15\n00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.895\ngather images and\ninformation on mobile devices.\n\n16\n00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.752\nI've actually got\na sample image loaded up.\n\n17\n00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:51.337\nWe're going to take a look at what\ncell phone secrets may be and\n\n18\n00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:52.878\nhow we can ascertain what they are and\n\n19\n00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:55.663\ndelve under the covers in there\na little bit and if you're really,\n\n20\n00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:59.040\nreally good I'm actually going to\ndo something extra special for you.\n\n21\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.210\nLet's take a look right here if we could,\nwe're going to go full screen because it's\n\n22\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.290\ngoing to be hard for\nyou to see some of the detail on that.\n\n23\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.390\nI'm running this particular set of\nsoftware we're going to demo here\n\n24\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.580\non Windows ten, I'm going to switch over\nto a server 12 R2 box in a few minutes and\n\n25\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.190\ndo a demo of autopsy over there and\nrun it there.\n\n26\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.690\nWe're going to switch it up a little bit,\nbut on this one\n\n27\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.760\nyou see me demo on this box in earlier\nepisode, this is the workstation box.\n\n28\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.990\nWe're mimicking what a forensic\nworkstation may look like with\n\n29\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.320\nall of our software installed and all the\nclutter on the desktop that goes with it.\n\n30\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.770\nBut Mobile Edit is a set of tools\nthat we can use for mobile forensics,\n\n31\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.580\none of the ones that's well\nknown in the industry.\n\n32\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.790\nThey have a SIM clone product right here,\n\n33\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.590\nbroken out separately from\ntheir overarching product.\n\n34\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.910\nWe're gonna take a look at\ntheir Mobile Edit forensic\n\n35\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.910\nproduct here in a just a minute.\n\n36\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.780\nIt's so dark.\n\n37\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.350\nIt's kinda hard to see on the screen\ncuz the background is black.\n\n38\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.440\nBut I'll go through this with you.\n\n39\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.690\nBut Sim Clone is right here\nis one of the options in\n\n40\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.380\nthe forensics toolkit that they provide,\nbut it's also a standalone tool.\n\n41\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.430\nSo, we'll take a look at that separately.\n\n42\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.430\nIt's a little bit easier\njust to see the detail.\n\n43\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.540\nSo, you'll see we need to have a sim\ncard reader installed on the system for\n\n44\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.890\nus to then be able to spin this\nsoftware up and actually use it.\n\n45\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.400\nI don't have a SIM card reader installed,\nwe're just showing you the software.\n\n46\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.010\nThis is a virtual environment and\nI haven't actually configured and\n\n47\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.940\nload it up SIM card reader.\n\n48\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.090\nTypically, USB based device\nwould be use for that.\n\n49\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.343\nBut we can easily plug one in in the real\nworld [SOUND] Part of our forensics lab or\n\n50\n00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.627\nforensics work station toolkit\nwould be to build that out.\n\n51\n00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:31.120\nOnce we have that,\nwe would then be able to go in, and\n\n52\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.919\nwe would be able to read the SIM card that\nwe have put into the SIM card reader, and\n\n53\n00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.642\nwe would then be able to get\ninformation on the SIM card and\n\n54\n00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:41.400\nget a readout of all the data points\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.710\nAnd all the information we\nwere talking about extracting,\n\n56\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.710\nthe unique sequence ID or\nthe serial number.\n\n57\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.450\nThe handset information, the carrier\ninformation, what country its located in,\n\n58\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.470\nthe IMEI all the things we talked\nabout would be in the sim card.\n\n59\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.770\nSo we'll be able to go in and use this,\nyou'll see down here detecting readers and\n\n60\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.860\nsim cards it hasn't found anything\nbecause we're not actually running one.\n\n61\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.420\nThis is the kind of software that\nwould be used, the mobile edit\n\n62\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.120\nForensics software as I've\nmentioned is going to be available.\n\n63\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.540\nWe would be able to plug in,\nwe need a USB cable and\n\n64\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.000\nwe download a set of drivers that's\nabout 70 mags worth the drivers and\n\n65\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.030\nthe drivers' pack and we get up data\nonce from the internet when we install\n\n66\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.870\nthe software that we would get that allow\nus to have all the appropriate drivers for\n\n67\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.570\nall the mobile platforms that\nare supported by the tool.\n\n68\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.550\nEvery so often, you go out,\nyou check, you update them.\n\n69\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.750\nSo you would plug in, it says here,\nno phone connected right now.\n\n70\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.550\nI know it's kinda hard to see the fine\nprint, but connect your phone and\n\n71\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.850\nit will automatically appear here.\n\n72\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.810\nIf not, click button to start wizard,\nthe connect button right here.\n\n73\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.620\nWe would cable this up to the workstation,\nplug it in, assuming we had all the latest\n\n74\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.000\ndrivers, and we would then be able to\ndo things once we interrogate the phone\n\n75\n00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.620\nlike SIM cloning, open up the case,\nyour hex stamp of the data,\n\n76\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.750\nyour photo viewer and forensic report\non the device, I'm going to show you,\n\n77\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.310\nwhat that will look like in another\ntool on Server 12 machine once but\n\n78\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.650\nwe usually see that's gonna be a little\neasier to interact with that gonna\n\n79\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.440\nImage of a quote unquote, mobile\ndevice that we're already gonna use.\n\n80\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.840\nSo, we've got the equivalent of what a\nphone would be loaded up as an image file.\n\n81\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.860\nWe're gonna load it into,\n\n82\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.710\nI've already preloaded it into\nthe software, and we'll take a look at it.\n\n83\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.040\nBut I wanted you to get a sense\nof what some of the common\n\n84\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.000\nforensic toolkits look like and\nthe capabilities that they have available.\n\n85\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.230\nThis is going to allow us to do\na live view of phone content.\n\n86\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.310\nOr be able to do very simple connect\nprocess, just literally cable it up,\n\n87\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.160\nrun the system, run the software\nrather on top of the system.\n\n88\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.402\nYou do need administrative rights for\nthis, but no big deal, very easy to do.\n\n89\n00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:43.480\nAnd then we're able to get in and\nsee everything.\n\n90\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.760\nWe connect phones via cable,\nBluetooth, or Wi-Fi, by the way.\n\n91\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.890\nSo we don't need the cable if we did have.\n\n92\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.800\nThis is a virtual machine.\n\n93\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.880\nWe're not obviously gonna\nhave Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\n\n94\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.160\nCapabilities in this.\n\n95\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.990\nBut if we did in the real world on\na standard forensics workstation,\n\n96\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.200\nhave Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, we could\nactually just cable up wirelessly, or\n\n97\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.180\nconnect wirelessly rather, and we wouldn't\neven need a cable in order to be able to\n\n98\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.015\nget to the system, so\ngives a lot of flexibility.\n\n99\n00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:10.265\n&gt;&gt; But, were will be able to perform\nthis tools, I guess my question is in\n\n100\n00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:14.615\nan offline state, to ultimately circumvent\nin the previous episode you were talking\n\n101\n00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.582\nabout, our pin codes and our pox, would\nthat be a way to create a clone Phone and\n\n102\n00:05:18.582 --> 00:05:21.652\nthen so we don't end up locking\nourselves out of that device?\n\n103\n00:05:21.652 --> 00:05:23.002\n&gt;&gt; Well, two very different approaches.\n\n104\n00:05:23.002 --> 00:05:26.812\nSo with there, we're looking at trying to\nget into the device while it's powered on,\n\n105\n00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:30.862\nextracting information from, let's say, a\nSIM card, whether it's powered on or off.\n\n106\n00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.502\nGetting in the device while it's\npowered on through the PIN or\n\n107\n00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:34.992\nwhatever the code would be.\n\n108\n00:05:34.992 --> 00:05:38.732\nThat would be different because we're\ntrying to get into the device live to look\n\n109\n00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:39.622\nat information.\n\n110\n00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:40.942\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the last call made,\n\n111\n00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:42.480\nsomething like that.\n\n112\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.820\nGrabbing an image of\nthe phone as we've done here.\n\n113\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.250\nWe're gonna use this software to do or\nthe other package,\n\n114\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.170\nthat was a little bit harder\nto see that we would use.\n\n115\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.160\nImages are done traditionally on and\nthen used offline.\n\n116\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.370\nSo they're gonna be used offline.\n\n117\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.840\nWe're not worried about things like-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n118\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.360\n&gt;&gt; those codes for this cuz we're\nnot interrogating the SIM card,\n\n119\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.640\nin this case we're\ninterrogating the actual phone.\n\n120\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.620\nAnd the image will allow us to see all\nthe data that's there without a PIN,\n\n121\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.170\nor pass code.\n\n122\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.050\nSo it will allow us to\ncircumvent that protection\n\n123\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.820\nto answer your question directly.\n\n124\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.670\nBut we're looking at very different\nways of gathering information.\n\n125\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.730\nOne would be traditionally getting it with\na very specific piece of software like\n\n126\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.360\nthe first one I showed you, and no,\nwe don't need the packer or the pen\n\n127\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.980\nto be able to do that with some cloner\ncuz where taking the image out of them.\n\n128\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.480\nWe can get in and work with it offline or\nwe would do something like this which is\n\n129\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.540\na full blown image of a phone and\nwe're now gonna use a okay, for instance,\n\n130\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.510\na piece of software called Autopsy, which\nis a Linux UNIX system software that we\n\n131\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.720\nhave poured into windows as well we\nuse that to investigate the thumbs.\n\n132\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.970\nWe are going to look at that right now.\n\n133\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.170\nSo, if we can go back, over here, full\nscreen if we could, just to take a look?\n\n134\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.510\nSo, what I've done is I've gone ahead and\n\n135\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.480\nI've launched the autopsy tool,\nI know it's hard to see.\n\n136\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.730\nSee the little Doberman shortcut\nsitting on the desktop there?\n\n137\n00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.130\nSo we have the autopsy tool,\nI've loaded it up and\n\n138\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.560\nI've loaded the image file and\nalready setup the case.\n\n139\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.470\nI'll walk you through that after\nwe get done because it will just\n\n140\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.840\ntakes a long time not to setup the case,\nbut to load the data source and\n\n141\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.170\nthen actually bring the data and\nthe image in and\n\n142\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.370\nhave it one takes, it took about\n30 minutes to load the image up.\n\n143\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.830\nSo I just wanted to have that all done\nalready ahead of time because otherwise\n\n144\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.510\nwe got to sit and wait for it but\nit's a fairly straightforward interface,\n\n145\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.180\nclose the case or\nopen one at the data source.\n\n146\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.390\nWhere do we get the image from,\nwe just bring that in.\n\n147\n00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.140\nGenerate the report, we have\na report here that generates out and\n\n148\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.280\nshows us all the information\nthat was found.\n\n149\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.430\nWe'll go through this,\ntake a look at this in just a minute.\n\n150\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.270\nI just pre-loaded all\nthese in data just so\n\n151\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.240\nbe a little bit clearer during the demo.\n\n152\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.870\nSo what we've done is we've going to have\nand load it up our data source we have our\n\n153\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.850\ndevice image right here in\nthe standard image format that we use.\n\n154\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.450\nAnd up under the device image I can\nsee all the different folders and\n\n155\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.420\nitems that are there.\n\n156\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.930\nIt's an Android based device\nthat we have an image of.\n\n157\n00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.180\nWe have file types here so\nI have images for\n\n158\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.970\ninstance, if i go in here there's all\nsorts of images that are available, and\n\n159\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.050\nyou'll see we have the ability to bring up\na thumbnail sketch and we can see there's\n\n160\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.440\njust category, category,category of\ndifferent images that are available there.\n\n161\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.500\nI can see all sorts of different stuff.\n\n162\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.850\nWe can see that we have a lot of\ndifferent images that I can get,\n\n163\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.860\nanyone of them as you can see.\n\n164\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.190\nI can understand the image down here.\n\n165\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.420\nTake a look at it.\n\n166\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.990\nI can see any text, the results,\nmetadata, any hex code.\n\n167\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.620\nSo the equivalent of the hex code here,\nI'd be able to see.\n\n168\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.790\nI can look at the strings associated\nwith it if there are any strings.\n\n169\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.940\nI can look at the file metadata,\nI can look at results.\n\n170\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.550\nI can see any or all of these things,\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n171\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.350\nFor any of these images.\n\n172\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.850\nSo this is all stuff that would have\nbeen recovered from the mobile phone,\n\n173\n00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.990\nfrom essentially the hard drive image, the\nimage of the phone, and I can choose any\n\n174\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.200\none of these particular images, whatever\nit may be, and I can highlight it.\n\n175\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.810\nDoesn't matter what it is.\n\n176\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.770\nYeah, you can see that kinda thing there.\n\n177\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.690\nAnd I can go ahead,\nopen it up, extract files,\n\n178\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.760\ntag them, do all sorts of stuff\nhere with the image files.\n\n179\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.020\nI can go ahead, same thing,\nI have videos here, I have audio files,\n\n180\n00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.500\njust so you can see the kind\nof stuff that's there, right?\n\n181\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.400\nSo we have all sorts of information\nthat would be available to us.\n\n182\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.250\nIf there are any deleted files,\nI would be able to see those.\n\n183\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.720\nIf there had been files\nthat were deleted and\n\n184\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.440\nwanted to bring them back,\nI could potentially see them.\n\n185\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.420\nI have IP addresses I\nhave URLs that are here.\n\n186\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.300\nAll the websites that have been visited.\n\n187\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.850\nAnything from the phone I can find.\n\n188\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.880\nI have phone numbers, email addresses,\nI have all sorts of information.\n\n189\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.170\nI have metadata tags that are here\nI can search for and recover or\n\n190\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.500\nlook through the phone information\nbased on text strings.\n\n191\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.380\nSo just by loading up an image\ntaking forensically sound image,\n\n192\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.190\nloading it in, I can see and actually\ninteract with all this information.\n\n193\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.780\nSo I can highlight and\ngo to any one of these,\n\n194\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.910\ngo Microsoft whatever this\nURL would have been, it's not\n\n195\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.130\nproperties here it's just a URL string,\nI can see all the URLs that are here, so\n\n196\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.770\nI can get a complete accurate record or\nrepresentation.\n\n197\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.040\nOf all the data, whatever the user\nwould have been, who they spoke to,\n\n198\n00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.960\nthe phone numbers, the addresses,\nthe contacts, the pictures, the videos.\n\n199\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.150\nI can listen to the audio files,\n\n200\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.290\nif there are voice mails that are stored\non the phone as opposed to in the cloud.\n\n201\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.200\nI can get any and all of that.\n\n202\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.150\nWhen I create a report, I just get an HTML\nsummary, or I get different options.\n\n203\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.540\nI'll show you the output options.\n\n204\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.730\nFor the report in a minute, I just did\nthe html one cuz it was easy to use.\n\n205\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:38.850\nBut you'll see that I get\na listing of everything here.\n\n206\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.740\nBut I can just see all\nthe information that may be here.\n\n207\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.660\nAll right so when I generate the report.\n\n208\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.280\nI have the option, you'll see,\nto do HTML, I can do Excel,\n\n209\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.130\ntext file, Google Earth, so\nI can actually do a location item and\n\n210\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.760\nshow where some of the IP addresses and\nthings came out.\n\n211\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.680\nKinda cool.\n\n212\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.430\nTSK body file so I can actually\nuse different output options for\n\n213\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.660\ndifferent tools so that I can then\nuse it from different places.\n\n214\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.430\nSo this is how we can output a report.\n\n215\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:11.780\nNow I want to load the tool up,\nlet me just close the Autopsy tool,\n\n216\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.900\nload it back up, so you can see it\nopening up, very cute little doggy.\n\n217\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.130\nYou have to be a dog person to really\nlike dogs to use this kind of a tool.\n\n218\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.430\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm trying to find the correlation.\n\n219\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.804\n&gt;&gt; If you're a cat person,\nyou just ran away right now.\n\n220\n00:11:22.804 --> 00:11:23.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're a cat person\n\n221\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.920\nyou're gone, right?\n\n222\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.800\nAll right so this is-\n&gt;&gt; I expect to see like a zombie or\n\n223\n00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.920\nsomething here but-\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no so\n\n224\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.450\njust-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n225\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.640\n&gt;&gt; We create a new case,\nthis is how the tool loads.\n\n226\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; Open an existing one right,\n\n227\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.270\nthat kind of thing, want to create a new\ncase, just walk you through what I did\n\n228\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.340\nto start the demo out before\nyou saw it just the pre-work.\n\n229\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.910\nJust so\nyou can see what it actually looks like.\n\n230\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.130\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n&gt;&gt; We give it a case name, so\n\n231\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.090\ncall this you know IT Pro\n&gt;&gt; TV, called the first case mobile one,\n\n232\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.760\ncall this mobile two specify the directory\nI use have this file setting on\n\n233\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.480\nthe desktop called autopsy\nthat is available for\n\n234\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.720\nus to be able to use and so\nif I Do this and just go\n\n235\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.620\njust to show you sitting on the desktop, I\njust have the autopsy folder right there.\n\n236\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.560\nIt's just got the device image and\nthe case mobile information there.\n\n237\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.860\nThat's the AUT file, the file that\nI created for the first case.\n\n238\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.350\nThat's got the extension in it, so\nI'm just creating a new one there.\n\n239\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.570\nCase type single or multi user.\n\n240\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.110\nThis is a demo, version of the software is\nnot fully licensed we do multi user for\n\n241\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.480\na fully licensed product.\n\n242\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.420\nThis is single user in the demo mode.\n\n243\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.480\nYou can see i set that up.\n\n244\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.840\nJust need to provide new information for\nthe report, the tracking number for\n\n245\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.160\nthe case, who was the investigator,\nso you put the name in.\n\n246\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.190\nDo that, that’s all you have to do to\ncreate the case, it then loads up and\n\n247\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.160\nit asks me or\nprompts me to add the data source.\n\n248\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.400\nAnd then, once I do that or\nonce I’m ready to do that,\n\n249\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.370\nit’ll be just a second while it builds,\nbut once I add the data source in,\n\n250\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.680\nI can then go ahead, and\nI will be able to, there we go.\n\n251\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.880\nYou'll see that I'll be able to go in and\nI'll be able to say okay,\n\n252\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.420\nwhere it might be at the file from or\nwhat kind of data,\n\n253\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.960\nkind of source image,\nlocal disk, logical file.\n\n254\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.190\nI did image file for the phone manage\nspecify where the image follow will\n\n255\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.360\nbe have the image sitting in\nthe desktop autopsy folder.\n\n256\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.922\nBut you would specify wherever it is,\nwhat's the input time zone.\n\n257\n00:13:19.922 --> 00:13:23.660\nAnd then once you go through it loads and\nstarts interrogating.\n\n258\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.810\nSo I go through there,\ngrab my image, specify all that,\n\n259\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.710\nclick next,\nspecify what kind of modules I want.\n\n260\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.730\nThere's a whole bunch of things I can\ndo here you'll see recent activity,\n\n261\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.380\nhash look up, file type identifier,\n\n262\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.830\nkeyword search it has specs on\nall the kinds of keywords I want.\n\n263\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.590\nSome of these may or may not be selected\nby default you may have to go in and\n\n264\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.580\ndrill down and add them.\n\n265\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.510\nSo I had to select phone numbers and\n\n266\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.500\nIP addresses because they're not\nselected by necessarily by default but\n\n267\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.260\nthat how I got all of that email,\nparsing to look for email.\n\n268\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.290\nNow I'm gonna go in and\nuse an Android analyzer, things like that.\n\n269\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.260\nJust whatever I may do.\n\n270\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.760\nSo I'll do all that and then also\nprocess unallocated space or empty space\n\n271\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.560\nthe system says hey there's no data in and\nwe are not gonna get fooled by that right?\n\n272\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.830\nWe just first thing the bad actors do is,\n\n273\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.570\nthey put the data they don't want us to\nfind in the unallocated spaces thinking,\n\n274\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.020\nwe're not going to be silly enough\nto go look there, why would we?\n\n275\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.860\nThere's nothing there.\n\n276\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.010\nWink, wink, nod, nod, nudge,\nnudge, don't you believe me?\n\n277\n00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.530\nClearly, we know better as investigators,\nright?\n\n278\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.670\nOne of the most common things is\nthat we will find the data hiding in\n\n279\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.510\nthe unallocated space, white space,\nslack space, referred to different ways.\n\n280\n00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.040\nRemember back to the conversations we had\n\n281\n00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.230\nin the episodes around\nunderstanding the hard drive.\n\n282\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.550\nWe went through a whole\nseries of episodes there.\n\n283\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.300\nTalked in depth about how to manage\nhard drives, how to manage space.\n\n284\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.520\nWhat a bid abide a nibble\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n285\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Allocation units.\n\n286\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.790\n&gt;&gt; Allocation units and Spindle,\n\n287\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.010\nCylinder cluster, everything you\never wanted to know in the lot and\n\n288\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.450\nyou would never want to know again,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Well to all of that but\n\n290\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.060\npart of that was we talked about\nthe use of an allocated space,\n\n291\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.900\nwhite space, black space,\nto be able to hide data, right?\n\n292\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.550\nAnd so want to make we're aware of that,\njust reminding you that, right?\n\n293\n00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.360\nSo we can grab that Click Next.\n\n294\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.000\nNow we're kind of good and\nnow it's going to start.\n\n295\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.840\nYou'll see it's already running down here.\n\n296\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.090\nNow we're not going to obviously\nlet that thing go forever,\n\n297\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.310\nI told you it takes awhile to run.\n\n298\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.790\nBut you can see it is running down at\nthe bottom there and it is going to have\n\n299\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.780\na little graph that tells us how long\nit takes and what percentage we're at.\n\n300\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.770\nAnd if you let it go, eventually\nit'll load the same kind of data I\n\n301\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.670\nwas just showing you because\nI'm using the same image.\n\n302\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.550\nBut it will load all that and\nyou'll be able to see that.\n\n303\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.510\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n304\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.770\nWe have a sense of that.\n\n305\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.880\nJust to let you see how the tool works and\nhow it is setup and\n\n306\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.350\ndesigned to be able to be available for\nus, okay?\n\n307\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.830\nSo we're gonna just minimize that.\n\n308\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.870\nWe're not gonna bother with that cuz\nwe're not gonna let run the whole time.\n\n309\n00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:53.440\nBut that way, we can at least get a sense\nof the kind of mobile forensic so\n\n310\n00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.770\nwe engage in the kind of stuff\nthat we may be able to do.\n\n311\n00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.340\nAnd some o the tools, the techniques,\nand actually how we deploy them to\n\n312\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.230\nbe able to interrogate and ultimately\nfind data inside a mobile device.\n\n313\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.050\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, thank you.\n\n314\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.790\nI love this, my favorite part when we get\nto see these concepts that we spoke about\n\n315\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.760\nbut in action and\nthat gains all the experience.\n\n316\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.220\nSo thank you for that and thank you for\njoining us today as well but for\n\n317\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.100\nthis show, we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up.\n\n318\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.530\nRemember, I'm your host Jackie Boose.\n\n319\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.243\n&gt;&gt; I am not Jackie Boose,\nI am Adam Borden.\n\n320\n00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:23.985\nSee you next time here at

00:00:12.234\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.706\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CHFI\nversion nine series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:17.080\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.680\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat our forensic report writing and\n\n7\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.140\npresentations.\n\n8\n00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.740\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.330\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going very well hopefully.\n\n11\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.060\nEqually well for all of you out there.\n\n12\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.370\nYou know, one of the very important\nthings we have to think about when we\n\n13\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.250\nare becoming a forensic investigator is,\nhow do we present the evidence.\n\n14\n00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.550\nWe've talked about this in\na lot of different areas,\n\n15\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.230\nreporting relevant information in\na fashion that makes sense to the audience\n\n16\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.160\nat hand is always a critical skill.\n\n17\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.360\nBut there are some standards that we\nactually have to adhere to and follow,\n\n18\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.820\nif we're gonna present\ninformation in a court of law.\n\n19\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820\nBeing an expert witness does involve\nmore than just showing up, and talking,\n\n20\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.640\nand speaking articulately and\nauthoritatively.\n\n21\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.156\nSo there are some things\nwe'll talk about here.\n\n22\n00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.536\nThere's something called the Daubert\nStandard that is used in the United States\n\n23\n00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:03.667\nto judge the ability for somebody to\nbe considered a technical expert, and\n\n24\n00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.820\ntherefore be allowed to testify,\nand we'll talk about what that is.\n\n25\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.150\nAn expect witness has to\nmeet certain criteria.\n\n26\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.060\nSo many years of experience, so\nmuch education, things of that nature.\n\n27\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.684\nSo we'll go through that.\nBut\n\n28\n00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:15.530\nwe also wanna talk about what\nforensic reporting looks like.\n\n29\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.253\nA lot of times we will say especially\nwhen you're starting out, hey,\n\n30\n00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:24.028\njust go do it, and set it up,\nand you'll figure it out.\n\n31\n00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:25.640\nBut you don't really have a guide.\n\n32\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.740\nYou don't have a template.\n\n33\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.414\nNobody's really taken the time to show\nit to you, and you learn as you do,\n\n34\n00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:30.958\nas we say.\n\n35\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.210\nAnd sometimes it comes out good,\nand other times not so much.\n\n36\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.080\nAnd it would be nice if there were set\nof templates, set of guidelines we could\n\n37\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.530\nlook at, indeed there are,\nyou have to know where to look for them.\n\n38\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.397\nBut there certainly is\nguidance if you go and\n\n39\n00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:44.625\nget formally trained on how\nto do some of this stuff.\n\n40\n00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.969\nYou will often find that these\nrepositories of knowledge exist,\n\n41\n00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.494\nif you remember on some prior episodes\nearlier on when we talked about\n\n42\n00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:55.728\nthe investigative process back in\nthe very beginning of our conversations.\n\n43\n00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:59.110\nI took you to several websites\nincluding one on the idea,\n\n44\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.760\njust overall of all\nthe forensic material needed,\n\n45\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.400\nall the guides about how to execute\ndifferent aspects of forensics.\n\n46\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.080\nA lot of templates were there\naround different things that you\n\n47\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.420\ncould download and use.\n\n48\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.160\nWe've shown you examples of chain of\ncustody forms, of different kinds of\n\n49\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.410\ndocuments that investigators would\ntend to have at their disposal or use.\n\n50\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.460\nSo these things exist.\n\n51\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.051\nYou just have to obviously either be\ngiven them or know how go out and\n\n52\n00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:21.756\nfind them today.\n\n53\n00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:24.843\nBut I thought it would be good for us to\ntake a look at a sample report and see and\n\n54\n00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.990\nmaybe spend just a couple minutes\ntalking about the key areas in there.\n\n55\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.870\nWhat a simple or\n\n56\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.820\nrather a traditional sample of a forensic\ninvestigative report may look like.\n\n57\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.600\nSo if you join me here,\nthanks to the modern,\n\n58\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.860\nwonderful world of Internet browsing and\n\n59\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.470\nthis URL is in the show notes as all of\nthem are that we try to present to you.\n\n60\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.940\nWe have an example of an expert\nwitness digital forensics report here.\n\n61\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.360\nJust one that I tripped across and\nfound on the web.\n\n62\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.026\nAnd you can download the PDF from\nthis site if you want to, but\n\n63\n00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:51.402\nit's available for preview.\n\n64\n00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:53.707\nYou can just go through and\ntake a look at it right here.\n\n65\n00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.490\nSo we're just gonna scroll through and\nsee.\n\n66\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.940\nFormatting not withstanding,\nthe front page, this kind of stuff.\n\n67\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.980\nTotally up to you to decide\nhow you wanna give that.\n\n68\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.170\nNot so important.\n\n69\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.740\nBut what is important is\nyou would want to specify\n\n70\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.510\nas you may be able to see down here\nyour name and the credentials.\n\n71\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.500\nWhere you come from, who you are,\nwhy you're doing this.\n\n72\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.379\nSo this person is going to represent\nthe University of Technology in Jamaica.\n\n73\n00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.600\nIs a BS in Forensic Science and\nwe have his name here.\n\n74\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.740\nSo, it's important to know that so\n\n75\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.830\nwe can establish beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, the person, their identity and\n\n76\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.800\ntheir claim to be an expert based\non their credentials right?\n\n77\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.760\nSo it would be important.\n\n78\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.467\nWe don't want to have Cherokee's\ndaughter or son writing a report right?\n\n79\n00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:32.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n80\n00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.034\n&gt;&gt; That kind of thing.\n\n81\n00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:35.513\nNot that it wouldn't be important and\nprobably interesting, but\n\n82\n00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:38.391\nit may look a little bit different and\nperhaps doesn't have as much technical\n\n83\n00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:40.460\nclout right as somebody\nwho may be trained.\n\n84\n00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.140\nSo you'll have that.\n\n85\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.420\nSo you'll have the name\nof the investigator here,\n\n86\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.610\nwhoever they are,\nthe digital forensics examiner, right?\n\n87\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.220\nThings like that.\n\n88\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.710\nSo there's a couple different\npeople identified here.\n\n89\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.766\nWe'll have the subject,\nwhat the report is, what offense or\n\n90\n00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:58.978\noffenses maybe prosecuted or\nbe examined under this particular\n\n91\n00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:02.580\nInvestigation that took place,\nwho the accused was.\n\n92\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.405\nSo we'll see the name of the accused,\nthe date that the request was made,\n\n93\n00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:10.700\nthe date of the conclusion of\nthe investigation, all that kind of stuff.\n\n94\n00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.480\nWe will then have a table of contents,\npretty traditional in that respect,\n\n95\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.220\nlisting all the key areas of the report.\n\n96\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.080\nWe then have an overview, an executive\nsummary, background to the case, right?\n\n97\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.840\nWhoever this person was.\n\n98\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.020\nAnd, as a result, this person has\nthis credential, did this, and\n\n99\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.410\nis in this position.\n\n100\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.360\nThen, questions asked that\nare relevant to the case.\n\n101\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.650\nSo, what are the suppositions or\n\n102\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.020\nthings that we're looking at, that we want\nto validate, or at least be aware of.\n\n103\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.550\nSo, we're going to see those.\n\n104\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.680\nWhat was the search and seizure and\ntransport of evidence methodology used.\n\n105\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.595\nWhat kinds of exhibits\ndo we have generated,\n\n106\n00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:51.582\nso what did we find, so we see things\nlike burgundy Wi-Fi mobile cell phone,\n\n107\n00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.980\nwith a serial number is listed here.\n\n108\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.590\nSo we can see the cellphone serial number,\nis right there.\n\n109\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.280\nWe have another cellular phone,\na thumb drive was listed.\n\n110\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.180\nA black cellphone,\nthere's a bunch of different stuff.\n\n111\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.670\nUnique identifiers for them, right?\n\n112\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.865\nAnd just listing out, in table form,\nthings that are important.\n\n113\n00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:13.576\nEvidence that was searched for,\nwhat are we going to look for\n\n114\n00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:14.700\nbased on what was found?\n\n115\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.049\nWhat are the criminal offenses that we\nthink are being detailed that we would\n\n116\n00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:20.988\nhave to investigate or\nessentially provide information around?\n\n117\n00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:24.660\nAnd as result we're going to carry out\ncertain activities in the investigation.\n\n118\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.183\nSo there's all sorts of different\nstuff that would be listed here.\n\n119\n00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:30.630\nThen the details of the examination.\n\n120\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.670\nWhat forensic tool was used.\n\n121\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.860\nSo the FTK, the forensic toolkit\nimaging solution was used here.\n\n122\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.411\nFiles were generated and\nwe see a list, of all of the md5 and\n\n123\n00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:45.061\nsha1 hashes that are generated for\nthe files.\n\n124\n00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:49.062\nSo we can validate and verify the\nintegrity of them before and after meeting\n\n125\n00:05:49.062 --> 00:05:52.910\nthe original and then the image or\nimages if there was more than one.\n\n126\n00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.294\nThat were used and be able to cross\nwalk those and validate those, right?\n\n127\n00:05:56.294 --> 00:05:57.110\nIt's very important.\n\n128\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.410\n&gt;&gt; So why would this investigator,\nthis expert,\n\n129\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.010\nchoose to have two different\ntypes of algorithms here.\n\n130\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.830\nIs that something that's pretty common?\n\n131\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.869\n&gt;&gt; Two different hashes you mean.\n\n132\n00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:05.903\n&gt;&gt; Hashout, yes.\n\n133\n00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:07.920\n&gt;&gt; When you say hash algorithms,\nMD5 and SHA-1.\n\n134\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.790\nIt is actually fairly common.\n\n135\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.570\nWe will often use different\nalgorithms on number one to provide,\n\n136\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.270\nexcuse me, additional integrity.\n\n137\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.884\nSo simply say,look I hashed and\n\n138\n00:06:18.884 --> 00:06:22.722\nyou've seen this when I've done\ndemonstrations of things like hash calc.\n\n139\n00:06:22.722 --> 00:06:26.462\nCherokee and I have demonstrated tools\nlike that in other shows where often times\n\n140\n00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:28.882\nyou, by default have five or\nsix that are selected so\n\n141\n00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:30.930\nyou'll generate multiple hashes.\n\n142\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.420\nCertain specific methodologies\nwill call for one hash or another.\n\n143\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.297\nSo you may use certain hashes for\ncertain things, certain hashes for others.\n\n144\n00:06:39.297 --> 00:06:43.812\nNot that there are any better or any worse\njust that certain methodologies we use may\n\n145\n00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:46.210\ncall for the use of sha1 versus MD5.\n\n146\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.087\nSo you traditionally\nwill generate both and\n\n147\n00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:49.811\njust have them as points of reference and\n\n148\n00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:53.472\nthat way they can then be used to further\nvalidate and provide additional integrity.\n\n149\n00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:56.660\nSo we'll see those and\nthen deleted, encrypted and or\n\n150\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.180\nsteganographicaly modified\nfiles if there were any.\n\n151\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.790\nThey may find them here.\n\n152\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.460\nSo maybe some screen captures\nof things that were found.\n\n153\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.110\nSo hierarchy screen capture of it looks\nlike the evidence tree from within\n\n154\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.860\nthe FTK tool where their finding things,\nrecovered files, whatever the case may be.\n\n155\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.580\nHighlighting them and specifying\nthe serial numbers and/or the hashes.\n\n156\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.390\nThat we were use to identify these items,\nso they can be found here.\n\n157\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.540\nSo we tend to see a lot of this\nanalysis results, what did we find?\n\n158\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.200\nWhat are the outcomes of that some\nexhibits are identified here,\n\n159\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.130\nconclusions are going to be found right or\nmade route.\n\n160\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.455\nSo this is what a standard\nforensic report would look like.\n\n161\n00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.010\nAgain generic right?\n\n162\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.680\nJust a sample of one.\n\n163\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.617\nThis could obviously be substituted for\na variety of different things, but\n\n164\n00:07:42.617 --> 00:07:46.074\nthe idea would be that we'd wanna\nhave a form something like this.\n\n165\n00:07:46.074 --> 00:07:50.727\nAnd use something like this in order\nto be able to then provide our\n\n166\n00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:53.150\noutput from our investigation.\n\n167\n00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.170\nNow keep in mind, this may be internal.\n\n168\n00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.978\nMeaning this may not see the light\nof day outside of a company.\n\n169\n00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:02.266\nThis maybe an academic exercise, this\nmay have been just somebody's thesis or\n\n170\n00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:05.347\nsomebody's research project\nthat made everything up.\n\n171\n00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:07.918\nNot that they made up the hashing and\nall that stuff,\n\n172\n00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:10.086\nthey probably did all\nthat with dummy data.\n\n173\n00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:14.398\nBut this could just be a sample presented\nto walk through in a training environment.\n\n174\n00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:16.795\nYou know what a sample report\nwould look like, things like that.\n\n175\n00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:20.475\nSo in other words it may be dummy data\nthat's not actually legitimate but\n\n176\n00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:21.325\nit could also be real.\n\n177\n00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:24.935\nCould be an actual output of a real\ninvestigation that somebody posted right?\n\n178\n00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:26.035\nWe just don't know.\n\n179\n00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:29.655\nBut my point is that a lot of\nthese investigations will be\n\n180\n00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:30.735\ninternally consumed.\n\n181\n00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:34.230\nThey will be property of the company and\ndone by an internal expert or\n\n182\n00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:39.010\nan internal incident response function and\nthey will go to senior managers, but\n\n183\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.890\nmay never go out to law enforcement.\n\n184\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.050\nLaw enforcement reports will\nlook a little different.\n\n185\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.970\nThey'll be more detailed, they'll be more\nformal, they'll be more structure and\n\n186\n00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.280\nmore sections to them.\n\n187\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.790\nThey'll be bringing in and\nspecifying laws that are referenced,\n\n188\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.220\nand you know, things like that.\n\n189\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.062\nThis is clearly an internal report that\nwas done that's not gonna be driven by law\n\n190\n00:08:56.062 --> 00:08:57.825\nenforcement, but you get the idea.\n\n191\n00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:00.270\nIt could certainly look\nsomething like that.\n\n192\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.120\nSo it's important for us as\ninvestigators to have a sense of this.\n\n193\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.422\nBecause it's not just us writing up\na bunch of bullet points on a spreadsheet,\n\n194\n00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.979\nor on a PowerPoint slide deck or\nin an e-mail.\n\n195\n00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:12.799\nI mean, that may be an informal\nway of presenting information,\n\n196\n00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.530\nthat's not by any means wrong.\n\n197\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.910\nBut when we have to\nformally present findings,\n\n198\n00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.980\nit will look something along\nthe lines of what we see here.\n\n199\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.120\nSo, we just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and have a sense of that.\n\n200\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.278\nWhat does it mean to be an expert witness?\n\n201\n00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:24.980\nOne of the things we talked about.\n\n202\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.470\nExpert witnesses, as I said,\nare typically people that have education\n\n203\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.710\nin certain areas and can validate skills\nand on the job real world experience.\n\n204\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.890\nProbably for a number of years doing\ncertain things to be considered experts.\n\n205\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.690\nAnd so there are some standards that\nwe have to match up against and\n\n206\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.470\nbe weighed against in order to\nbe considered a expert witness.\n\n207\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.032\nThe court of jurisdiction or the court\nof record will have the final say as\n\n208\n00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:51.560\nto whether or not you are considered\nan expert witness and\n\n209\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.898\nif you are recognized as such,\nallowed to testify.\n\n210\n00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:58.260\nAnd if not, we'll tell you hey sorry thank\nyou, but you don't meet these criteria.\n\n211\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.520\nIt's up to the judge in other words\nultimately to apply the standard and\n\n212\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.356\nthen to weigh your ability to\nmeet that standard or exceed it.\n\n213\n00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:07.176\nAnd decide whether or\nnot you will be given the moniker or\n\n214\n00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:11.320\nbe given the designation of being an\nexport witness so just keep that in mind.\n\n215\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.100\nYou can be a technical witness\nversus an expert witness.\n\n216\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.139\nAnd this is one of the things that\npeople don't often understand and\n\n217\n00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:18.579\ndon't differentiate around,\n\n218\n00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:21.583\ncuz we we don't often see this on\ndocu dramas and TV's and movies.\n\n219\n00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:24.057\nYou just see people testifying, and\nthey're all referred to as experts.\n\n220\n00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.700\nYou don't really know that\nthere may be a distinction.\n\n221\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.640\nA technical expert is somebody, or\nexcuse me, a technical witness, rather,\n\n222\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.620\nis somebody who can speak specifically\nto the certain functionality or\n\n223\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.670\ncertain specificity of a process or\na specific idea.\n\n224\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.870\nYou happen to be an expert in\nWindows Deployment services.\n\n225\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.870\nAnd you can speak to whether or\nnot the system is imaged a certain way.\n\n226\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.260\nAnd could it be modified?\n\n227\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.340\nThings like that.\n\n228\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.720\nBut you're very narrowly defined as\nhaving technical skills deep in one area.\n\n229\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.910\nSo you are somebody who's a practicing\nperson who does this all the time and\n\n230\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.620\ncan be called on for that skill.\n\n231\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.620\nWhereas an expert is an expert witness is\nsomebody who's more broadly knowledgeable.\n\n232\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.490\nAnd according to the U.S.\n\n233\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.940\nFederal rules of evidence, to be presented\nas an expert witness in court and\n\n234\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.780\nbe allowed to testify, you have to furnish\nand validate the following information.\n\n235\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.580\nIt's actually legal requirements.\n\n236\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.430\nYou have to have four years of previous\ntestimony, indicating experience.\n\n237\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.056\nYou have to have done this for\nawhile which begs the question,\n\n238\n00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:25.256\nyou have to have four years, how do\nyou actually become an expert witness.\n\n239\n00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:26.037\nRight if you think about the logic of it.\n\n240\n00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:26.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Chicken and\n\n241\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.340\nthe egg argument if I have to have\na certain amount of experience\n\n242\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.280\nto do what I'm doing and I can never get\nthe experience because I have to have\n\n243\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.390\nthat amount, how do I actually\nbecome an expert witness?\n\n244\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.220\nSo you have to have that, ten years of any\npublished literature that you've written\n\n245\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.070\non the subject and have a long\ntrack record associated with that.\n\n246\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.815\nPrevious payments receive when giving\ntestimony so you would have to have\n\n247\n00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:48.905\ninformation substantiate and\nvalidates that these things have happened.\n\n248\n00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:52.077\nAgain you don't hear about this on\nthese TV shows you just see somebody\n\n249\n00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:55.105\nshows up and says I'm an expert\nwitness and they testify right.\n\n250\n00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:58.135\nBut that doesn't necessary\nmean that you qualify\n\n251\n00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:02.395\ntypically you get the testimony\nexperience from a variety of places.\n\n252\n00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:05.803\nA lot of them you see doctors are called\nas expert witnesses, psychologist and\n\n253\n00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:08.084\nthings like that and\ncriminal trials for instance.\n\n254\n00:12:08.084 --> 00:12:12.107\nAnd they may not have necessary testified\nat court cases in the traditional way that\n\n255\n00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.470\nyou're seeing them.\n\n256\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.690\nMaybe they were called\nto testify the hearing.\n\n257\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.980\nNot necessarily the court case, right?\n\n258\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.077\nIs this person qualified\nto be on their own or\n\n259\n00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:23.480\nmaybe they need a guardian\nthings like that.\n\n260\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.750\nAs a psychologist you may get called\nin to offer an opinion there.\n\n261\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.870\nThat does count towards this\nidea of four years of testimony.\n\n262\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.130\nRIght going back and forth.\n\n263\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.572\nMaybe you have given testimony or\nhave been involved in internal boards and\n\n264\n00:12:35.572 --> 00:12:39.400\ncertification boards and\nthings like that in your career.\n\n265\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.480\nAnd you've sat and\n\n266\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.110\nnot only judged people in the sense that\nyou've allowed them to come before you.\n\n267\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.050\nGive testimony and talk about what\nthey did, but you may actually\n\n268\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.003\noffer testimony to a variety of\nexpert panels to explain things.\n\n269\n00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.990\nAll that's counted as part of this.\n\n270\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.345\nThat's where people get,\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps if you were an auditor of\n\n271\n00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:55.907\nsome sort?\n\n272\n00:12:55.907 --> 00:12:59.562\n&gt;&gt; As an auditor, maybe certainly that\nwould be one area as well where maybe you\n\n273\n00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.275\nwere called to testify about your,\n\n274\n00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:04.550\nfindings and over time you certainly\nrack up those kinds of things.\n\n275\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.417\nSo any or all those things would\ncertainly be part of that.\n\n276\n00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:11.252\nWe actually reference something I think\nI mentioned when we were starting out\n\n277\n00:13:11.252 --> 00:13:14.700\ncalled the daubert standard in\nthe US federal rules of evidence.\n\n278\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.770\nWe take a look here if we could just\nbring this up you'll see right here.\n\n279\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.010\nThe Deubert standard comes\nfrom a very famous case,\n\n280\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.990\nDeubert versus\nMeryl Dow Pharmaceuticals in 1993.\n\n281\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.579\nYou'll see the court\nreference right down here.\n\n282\n00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:30.723\nIt is currently used in the federal\ncourts and many state courts and\n\n283\n00:13:30.723 --> 00:13:33.432\nit replaces an older standard\ncalled the Frye standard.\n\n284\n00:13:33.432 --> 00:13:37.854\nReferenced at the bottom, to specify\nwhere you are qualified to be considered\n\n285\n00:13:37.854 --> 00:13:41.270\nan expert witness,\ncalled the Deubert standard.\n\n286\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.290\nAnd this is used by trial judges making\npreliminary assessments of the scientific\n\n287\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.880\ntestimony specific to certain kinds\nof witnesses, based on reasoning or\n\n288\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.590\nmethodology that could be proved or\ndisproved, and applied.\n\n289\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.360\nSo the idea here is, you know, we say\nthe methodology is valid if, whether\n\n290\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.970\nthe theory or technique in question can be\nand has been tested, whether it has been\n\n291\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:05.860\nsubjected to peer review in publication,\nit's known or potential error rate.\n\n292\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.610\nThe existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling it's operation, whether\n\n293\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.920\nit has attracted widespread acceptance,\nwithin the relevant scientific community.\n\n294\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.643\nSo, thse five key criteria used by\ntrial judges, at the federal level and\n\n295\n00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:20.708\nsome state levels of the United States,\nto decide whether or\n\n296\n00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:23.490\nnot something that's being\noffered into testimony.\n\n297\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.589\nOr somebody testifying about this\nmethodology or the standard will be\n\n298\n00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:32.130\nconsidered legitimate or not because\nit does or does not meet this criteria.\n\n299\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.438\nSo it's the standard\nthat's been in use now for\n\n300\n00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:38.191\nover 20 years now in the United States,\nreplaces an older standard that was\n\n301\n00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:40.633\ndislodged by the ruling\nin this particular case.\n\n302\n00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:44.491\nAnd is currently the standard that is used\nto weigh and to understand whether or\n\n303\n00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:45.900\nnot this should be allowed.\n\n304\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.270\nSo we just wanna make sure\nif you're planning on\n\n305\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.960\nIf you're giving expert\ntestimony in a scientific area,\n\n306\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.030\nyou would have to obviously be able\nto meet the criteria we discussed.\n\n307\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.300\nPlus the information you're\ngonna offer has to stand up\n\n308\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.790\nto the Deubert standard test.\n\n309\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.726\nAnd or if you're planning on studying for\n\n310\n00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:04.282\nthe exam as I'm sure a lot of\nyou may over time wanna do.\n\n311\n00:15:04.282 --> 00:15:06.346\nYou should know what\nthe Deubert standard is.\n\n312\n00:15:06.346 --> 00:15:08.519\nBecause you may be asked about it so\nit would be important for\n\n313\n00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:09.690\nyou to be aware of it.\n\n314\n00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.230\nWe also want to think about\nthe order that a trial goes in.\n\n315\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.810\nYou know a lot of times again we see\naspects, snippets of a trial on tv or\n\n316\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.570\nin the movies.\n\n317\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.694\nBut unless you've actually\nsat through a real trial and\n\n318\n00:15:18.694 --> 00:15:20.739\nhave done this professionally\nbeen involved in one.\n\n319\n00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:24.930\nThen you may not really understand\nthe scope as we call it of the trial.\n\n320\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.420\nThe flow and it has an order to\nit just like everything else.\n\n321\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.387\nWe start with motions which often will\ntake place in the beginning to set up and\n\n322\n00:15:31.387 --> 00:15:33.080\ndo a variety of things.\n\n323\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.380\nThen we'll have opening statement.\n\n324\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.700\nYou probably see those very\noften in the movies and on tv.\n\n325\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.041\nYou don't always see the motions you\nsee them throughout the trial but\n\n326\n00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.321\nyou may not see them in the beginning.\n\n327\n00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:45.336\nWhere they're talking about setting up the\nvenue, what the calendar will look like,\n\n328\n00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:49.131\nwhether or not they'll allow this or that\nto take place, will this be televised,\n\n329\n00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:51.750\nwill it be an open court,\nwill it be a closed court.\n\n330\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.761\nThese are all motions that are dealt with\nprior to actually testimony beginning.\n\n331\n00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:57.469\nSo this is all the wrangling and\n\n332\n00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:02.180\nmaneuvering that often takes place prior\nto the actual case itself being tried.\n\n333\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.320\nOpening statements will often be\ngiven both from the prosecution and\n\n334\n00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.320\nthe defense side.\n\n335\n00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.470\nPresentation of the case,\ncross examination or\n\n336\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.600\nrebuttal, goes in that order.\n\n337\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.570\nJury orders meaning the judge will give,\nif it is a jury trial.\n\n338\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.580\nRemember not all trials are jury trials.\n\n339\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.890\nYou may be tried before a judge and\nthere may be no jury.\n\n340\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.900\nSo in that case there\nare no jury orders but\n\n341\n00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.198\nassuming there is a jury he\nwill give out jury orders.\n\n342\n00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:26.150\nThe judge will instruct the jury\non what they have to do,\n\n343\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.890\nhow they have to interpret the evidence.\n\n344\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.722\nThings that they can and cannot do, sends\nthem off into the jury, you often see that\n\n345\n00:16:32.722 --> 00:16:37.647\nin movies something like that so just keep\nin mind that those things will take place.\n\n346\n00:16:37.647 --> 00:16:40.290\nActually, I'm sorry,\njury orders come after closing arguments.\n\n347\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.867\nMy apologies, we should have closing\narguments and then the jury orders, right?\n\n348\n00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:47.560\nBecause jury orders are given right\nbefore the jury goes in to deliberate.\n\n349\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.760\nSo my mistake, I apologize.\n\n350\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.888\nI got those out of order, so we would\nsee presentation of the case across\n\n351\n00:16:51.888 --> 00:16:55.558\nexamination rebuttal closing arguments and\nthen jury orders, just to make sure.\n\n352\n00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:58.450\nSo that is the order that\nwe would see at trial.\n\n353\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.090\nKind of navigating itself through and\nagain,\n\n354\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.140\nthe logical flow would be important for\nus as investigators to be aware of.\n\n355\n00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.040\nMore often than not, most forensic\ninvestigators don't show up in the court\n\n356\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.690\nof law, on a very regular basis and\ndon't often give testimony because\n\n357\n00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.180\nmany of the cases we work\non just never go to court.\n\n358\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.680\nThey just don't see\nthe light of the courtroom.\n\n359\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.550\nThey are often times\nadministrative in nature.\n\n360\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.650\nThey are gonna be internal to a company.\n\n361\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.844\nAnd as a result, we may not actually have\nto offer testimony in open court, we may\n\n362\n00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:29.748\nsit in front of a room of senior managers\nor senior leaders in the business.\n\n363\n00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:32.775\nAnd you know, be asked questions and\nreport our findings and you kinda be\n\n364\n00:17:32.775 --> 00:17:36.740\nqueried about what's going on, that's not\nthe same thing as being in a court of law.\n\n365\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.545\nNot as formal certainly,\nnot as important and\n\n366\n00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:40.501\nmeaningful in the sense\nof the weight it carries.\n\n367\n00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:44.117\nBut we certainly maybe providing\ninformation In some sort of avenue or\n\n368\n00:17:44.117 --> 00:17:47.672\nvenue like that but it's very rare\nthat you wind up going into court so\n\n369\n00:17:47.672 --> 00:17:51.380\nit's just something to consider and\nbe aware of, just to think about.\n\n370\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.791\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam thank you for\n\n371\n00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:56.782\nall that great information explaining\nthe difference between technical and\n\n372\n00:17:56.782 --> 00:18:01.522\nexpert witness and also forensic reporter\nand also taking a look at that standard.\n\n373\n00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:03.947\nAnd I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n374\n00:18:03.947 --> 00:18:05.518\nSo we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n375\n00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:07.287\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n376\n00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.812\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n377\n00:18:08.812 --> 00:18:11.174\n&gt;&gt; See you here next time on ITPRO.TV\n\n378\n00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:18.507\n[MUSIC]\n\n379\n00:18:18.507 --> 00:18:21.104\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",
