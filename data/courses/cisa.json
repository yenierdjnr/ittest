at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.250\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.930\ntoday we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n6\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.130\nAnd in this episode, we want to\ntake a little bit of time to kind\n\n7\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.630\nof go over the certification, some of\nthe requirements, and some of the dos and\n\n8\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.890\ndon'ts, and some tips on\ngetting prepared for the exam,\n\n9\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.720\ngetting registered, who provides the exam,\nand things like that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.230\nAnd with me today, is Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n11\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460\nOne of the authors,\nof the Cybex, CISA study guides.\n\n12\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.050\nAnd who better to talk to\nyou about the exam, right?\n\n13\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.030\nThan the author of the book.\n\n14\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.680\nSo, here is Mr. Brian.\n\n15\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.540\nHow's it going, Brian?\n\n16\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.310\n>> Hi, Mike, thanks.\n\n17\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.810\nThanks for having me.\n\n18\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.180\nThis morning I'd like to kick off and\ntalk a little bit about the exam,\n\n19\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.556\nthe ISACA CISA exam, as well as exam prep.\n\n20\n00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.720\nI'm not going to tell you a lot of\nspecifics about the exam in terms of\n\n21\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.410\nquestions.\n\n22\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.232\nI know you'd love to have\nthe questions and the answers.\n\n23\n00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:08.607\n>> [LAUGH] What's the answer\nto question number four?\n\n24\n00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:09.113\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:10.615\n>> But I want to talk a little bit about\n\n26\n00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:14.595\nsome of the things you should\nexpect on the exam, how to prepare\n\n27\n00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:19.590\nmore effectively for the exam so\nthat you do the best you can.\n\n28\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.810\nThe first comment I would make is that In\nall my 20 something years of taking exams,\n\n29\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820\nthe CISA exam was by far one of\nthe toughest I've ever taken.\n\n30\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.510\nVery tough exam.\n\n31\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.970\nOne of the reasons that the fail rate,\n\n32\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.710\nwhich is about 40% on average,\nis as high as it is,\n\n33\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.470\nis that often times inexperienced\nauditors take the exam before they have\n\n34\n00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.720\nactually completed time in the trenches,\nif you will, doing actual audit work.\n\n35\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.610\nSo that when they start\nstudying all this material,\n\n36\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.930\nrather than it just being memorized,\nit really should become assimilated.\n\n37\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.300\nAnd it should become part\nof your knowledge base, and\n\n38\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.770\nthat's hard to do if you haven't\nhad the real world experience.\n\n39\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.190\n>> Yeah, you know you see a lot of these\nvendors saying that they require so\n\n40\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.430\nmany years of experience before.\n\n41\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.960\nAnd a lot of times it's kind of who ha,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.050\nI mean, you can get in there if you\nknow the material you can pass the exam,\n\n43\n00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.510\nnot the case with this\nparticular exam though.\n\n44\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.100\n>> Correct.\n\n45\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.420\nThat's right.\nYou have to have a minimum\n\n46\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.500\nof five years experience.\n\n47\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.930\nAnd you have to demonstrate knowledge and\nproficiency in a very wide\n\n48\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.220\nrange of topics, some of which I'm going\nto talk about here in just a minute.\n\n49\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.780\nSo there are five domains covered in\nthe ISACA CIS exam as it stands today.\n\n50\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.078\nThe first being the process of\nauditing information systems.\n\n51\n00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:40.080\nThat covers 21% of the questions.\n\n52\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.720\nI don't know the exact number\nthat that equates out to, but\n\n53\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.440\nthe total exam is 150 questions, so\nyou can do the math if you want.\n\n54\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.990\nDomain two, which is governing and\nmanagement of IT, is 16% of the exam.\n\n55\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.462\nThat's the smallest category, although I\nthink it's one of the more important ones.\n\n56\n00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:01.480\n>> Information systems,\n>> Acquisition development implementation\n\n57\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.380\nis domain three that represents\n18% of the questions on the exam.\n\n58\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.770\nDomain four which is information systems,\noperations maintenance and\n\n59\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.240\nservice management, is 20% and\nthen domain number five is\n\n60\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.180\nthe protection of information assets\n>> Which is 25%,\n\n61\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.760\nand in my opinion,\nprobably the most important.\n\n62\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.060\nBecause, the whole purpose of this field\nof endeavor, is to ensure that we're\n\n63\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.280\nconducting good risk management practices\nin order to protect their information\n\n64\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.070\nassets to the level that our\norganizations have deemed necessary.\n\n65\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.090\n>> So, that gives you a little bit\nof outline over the five domains,\n\n66\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.660\nand the amount of information\nof each of those.\n\n67\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.210\nWe often times get the question, you know?\n\n68\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.890\nDo I have to pass every one of\nthe domains in order to pass the exam?\n\n69\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.720\nWell, my response to that is, you have to\nbe able to demonstrate proficiency and\n\n70\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.710\nunderstanding across all five domains.\n\n71\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.600\n>> Age.\n\n72\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.570\nI can't tell you whether or\n\n73\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.596\nnot you missed 12 questions in\nprotecting information assets.\n\n74\n00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:04.960\nWhether you're going to pass the exam or\n\n75\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.280\nnot because it has to do\nwith the total score.\n\n76\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.060\nThe exam, as I said earlier,\nis 150 questions.\n\n77\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.210\nThey're all multiple choice.\n\n78\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.680\nYou will have four hours\nto complete the exam\n\n79\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.950\nwith a half an hour before the four\nhours for oral instruction.\n\n80\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.270\nSo, the exams typically will run from\n9 o'clock in the morning to 1 PM.\n\n81\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.396\nTypically the oral\ninstructions take place from\n\n82\n00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:37.520\n8:30 to 9:00 and registration\nis generally from 7:30 to 8:30.\n\n83\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.930\nCouple of tips, be early,\nmake sure you have picture ID's with you,\n\n84\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.150\nmake sure you've registered for the exam,\nmake sure you have all your paperwork.\n\n85\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.170\nThis is an audit association, and they\ndon't take kindly to people showing up\n\n86\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.050\nwithout their paper work in proper order,\nif you get my drift.\n\n87\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.660\nSo, If you have to travel a fair distance\nas I did when I took my CIS exam,\n\n88\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.600\nIS exam, I would encourage you to get a\nhotel a night before if you can afford it\n\n89\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.218\nor if your employer will help, et cetera.\n\n90\n00:05:11.218 --> 00:05:15.260\nTo make sure that you\nget an adequate rest,\n\n91\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.830\ndrink plenty of fluids,\nyou know don't stuff at breakfast,\n\n92\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.380\nget a little bit of exercise,\nmake sure you sleep well the night before.\n\n93\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.920\nIf you've done your preparation, and\nI've taught college classes for years,\n\n94\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.600\nif you've done adequate preparation,\nyou're going to do fine.\n\n95\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.980\nDon't let yourself get all psyched\nup when it comes test day.\n\n96\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.600\nIf you haven't done your prep and\nyou find yourself sweating,\n\n97\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.020\nthere's a good chance you're\nnot going to pass the exam.\n\n98\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.830\nThis is a tough exam, and very few people\nget through it by the skin of their teeth.\n\n99\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.830\nYou either know it, or you don't.\n\n100\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.890\nSo, please make sure that you get a copy\nof the book, that you read through it,\n\n101\n00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.840\nthat you use the practice questions\nat the end of each chapter.\n\n102\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.820\nWhen you purchase the book,\n\n103\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.940\nit also entitles you to\na download of a practice exam.\n\n104\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.350\nI don't exactly know the URL for that,\nbut I think we can get it later if we,\n\n105\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.314\n[CROSSTALK] for posting up later.\n\n106\n00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:12.147\nPracticing questions Is a great way to\ntest you or to prepare you for the test,\n\n107\n00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:19.350\nI'm sorry, because you may see those same\nexact questions just simply reworded.\n\n108\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.970\nYears ago I played golf and\n\n109\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.330\nI learned something from my old\ngolfer buddies back in the day.\n\n110\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.170\nWe used to hear people say I've\nmade that shot before, meaning that\n\n111\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.840\nthey've stood in that very spot because\ntheir ball dropped in that very spot, and\n\n112\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.300\nit was the same distance to the green.\n\n113\n00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.650\nSo they've actually made that shot two or\nthree times and they know how to do it.\n\n114\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.240\nThey're very comfortable with it.\n\n115\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.980\nI think the same is true with prepping for\nyour questions.\n\n116\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.680\nIf you've read the material,\nyou've seen the question before.\n\n117\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.500\nWhen you see it, even though\nthe words may be a little different,\n\n118\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.670\nyou're going to understand\nwhat it's talking about.\n\n119\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.910\nYou cannot come to this exam unprepared.\n\n120\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.365\nIt will crucify you.\n\n121\n00:06:53.365 --> 00:06:55.540\n[LAUGH] So do your homework.\n\n122\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.070\nThis is one that really pays off.\n\n123\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.130\nI can't stress that enough.\n\n124\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.680\nOkay?\nSo a couple of things about the exam\n\n125\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.710\nagain, make sure you\nanswer all the questions.\n\n126\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.100\nDon't leave any blanks You won't get\nany points for questions unanswered.\n\n127\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.600\nManage your time effectively.\n\n128\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.610\nYou'll have four hours\nto complete the test.\n\n129\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.520\nThis is a pencil and paper exam.\n\n130\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.110\nI would encourage you to write notes\nin the margins of the paper exam.\n\n131\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.599\nAnd asterisk your questions, answers,\netc., for you to review later.\n\n132\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.370\nEven though you may question and\n\n133\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.040\nanswer, answer it anyway on your answer\nsheet, and then go back to it later.\n\n134\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.940\nMake sure you mark it appropriately,\ngo back to later to check.\n\n135\n00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.430\nBecause, again, if you run out of time and\n\n136\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.910\nyou didn't answer that question,\nyou're going to get zero points for it.\n\n137\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.499\nAnd every point counts, [LAUGH] At this\npoint when you've only got 150 questions.\n\n138\n00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:56.755\nThere are no lab or\nscenario based questions on the exam.\n\n139\n00:07:56.755 --> 00:07:59.878\nIt's all 150 multiple choice.\n\n140\n00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:05.463\nGenerally speaking, the best way to\nprepare for those kinds of questions,\n\n141\n00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:09.330\nis to eliminate at least\ntwo answers that are wrong.\n\n142\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.130\nThere's almost always two answers\nthat are wrong, completely wrong.\n\n143\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.480\nChoose the best answer.\n\n144\n00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.290\nNot the answer you think is right,\nbut choose the best answer.\n\n145\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.030\nRemember your study guides, and\n\n146\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.850\nyour test questions because they will\nprep you for what the best answer is.\n\n147\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.530\nThere may be questions where\nthere are two good answers, but\n\n148\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.445\nonly one of those two is the best answer.\n\n149\n00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:31.020\nOkay?\n\n150\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.030\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n151\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.280\nAnd again,\nI can't stress enough the practice exams.\n\n152\n00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.430\nThere are questions in the back of the\nchapters are the best way in the world to\n\n153\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.730\nprepare for this material.\n\n154\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.470\nBring several sharpened\nnumber two pencils.\n\n155\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.050\nThey will have some pencils there.\n\n156\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.810\nThe test proctors will have pencils,\nbut they only have so many.\n\n157\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.996\nAnd you're all grown up.\n\n158\n00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:53.355\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So take care of yourself.\n\n159\n00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:54.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bring your own pencils.\n\n160\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.130\nYou may want to bring a sweater or\na jacket with you especially for\n\n161\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.560\nthe June exams.\n\n162\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.180\nBecause the rooms can be air conditioned\nand often times quite chilly.\n\n163\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.880\nMine was, I remember I took my CSA exam in\nJune and it was quite cold in the room.\n\n164\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.490\n>> Those are good points because\na lot of us are familiar to taking\n\n165\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.370\ncertification exams for Microsoft or\n\n166\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.630\nCompTIA, and these are computer based\ntests where we're typing on a screen.\n\n167\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.990\nThis is not that way.\n\n168\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.470\nSo you do this like the old high\nschool and college days,right?\n\n169\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.700\nYou have to come with pencils sharpened,\nwith erasers and all of that.\n\n170\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.390\n>> Correct and in fact the exams are given\ntypically in a room that's set up\n\n171\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.340\nin classroom style where you'll sit\nnext to each other and the proctors will\n\n172\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.770\nspecifically assign you seats so that\n>> You not only will not be sitting next\n\n173\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.620\nto anyone with the same CIS exam as you\nbecause there are at least four of them.\n\n174\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.740\nThey mix those up.\n\n175\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.550\nBut you'll also be in the room taking\nexams with folks who are taking\n\n176\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.740\ntheir CRISC.\n\n177\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.440\nThey're CISM or they're CGIT.\n\n178\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.360\nI don't believe there's\nanyone else in the room yet.\n\n179\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.900\nI think they're doing the new nexus exams,\nthe CSX exams online.\n\n180\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.510\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n181\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.480\nYou will be in a room with other people.\n\n182\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.130\nYou're allowed to take breaks.\n\n183\n00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.630\nYou will not be allowed to bring food or\ndrink into the room.\n\n184\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.620\n>> Unless you have some type of\nmedical condition that requires\n\n185\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.090\nspecial accommodation.\n\n186\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.580\nIf that's the case,\nplease let the proctors know.\n\n187\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.870\nGenerally, you fill that\ninformation out when you apply for\n\n188\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.840\nyour exam ahead of time so they know.\n\n189\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.620\nBut if nobody is prepared for\nyou, if you are wheelchair bound,\n\n190\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.180\nor have special dietary needs,\n\n191\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.500\nor you need to take prescription medicines\n>> Or if you have a seizure disorder.\n\n192\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.270\nAnything serious like that, please let the\ntest proctor know so they understand in\n\n193\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.080\nthe even that something were to happen\nthat they'd be able to respond properly.\n\n194\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.210\n>> Very good.\n\n195\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.950\n>> Let the proctor know when you\nneed to take a bathroom break,\n\n196\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.250\nthat's perfectly legitimate.\n\n197\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.240\nThey'll ask you to close your test\nbooklet, put your pencil down,\n\n198\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.870\nleave all your stuff there and\nyou'll be checked out of the room and\n\n199\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.070\nthen you have to check back in.\n\n200\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.590\nYou can't just randomly walk back\nin the room, they don't allow that.\n\n201\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.260\nAgain, these are very\npersnickity auditors,\n\n202\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.830\nthey're very careful about the rules.\n\n203\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.880\nDrink plenty of fluids in advance so\nthat you are not thirsty.\n\n204\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.340\nI would stay away from caffeinated\nbeverages, Red Bull, excessive coffee etc.\n\n205\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.135\nMaybe have a cup like me,\nor two in the morning.\n\n206\n00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:28.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you get going but\n\n207\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.780\nkind of take it easy with that because\nit will only make you more jittery and\n\n208\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.500\nmake it harder for you to concentrate.\n\n209\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.000\nI think I mentioned being on time.\n\n210\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.180\nThat's really important because they have\na lot of people they have to shuttle in.\n\n211\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.870\nThere's a check-in process that they\ngo through, it's very methodical.\n\n212\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.350\nAnd they need plenty of time to get you\nregistered and get you in the room so\n\n213\n00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.280\nthat you're comfortable, you have\na little time to catch your breath, and\n\n214\n00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.459\nthat you have time to hear and understand\nall of the proctors or instructions.\n\n215\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.020\nRules state that no one is allowed\nin the room after the doors close so\n\n216\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.840\noral instructions have begun.\n\n217\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.050\nSo if you're late, I'm sorry but\nyou're going to have to retake the exam.\n\n218\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.970\nThey do not bend the rules on that.\n\n219\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.650\nSo you can beg and plead all you want\nbeing late because your car broke or\n\n220\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.690\nsomething and\n\n221\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.159\nchances are you'll have to plead to\nthe powers that be to get it changed.\n\n222\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.280\nNext is manage your time as much\nas you can during the exam.\n\n223\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.050\nYou've got four hours,\nwhich should be adequate.\n\n224\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.900\nIf you can't do the exam in four hours,\nand\n\n225\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.130\neither you have some test-taking problems,\nwhich you may need to address if you,\n\n226\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.000\nI can't imagine you got this far in your\ncareer and you're not aware of those.\n\n227\n00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.780\nSome people still have very severe\ntest anxiety, and it makes it hard for\n\n228\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.060\nthem to do that.\n\n229\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.140\nThis is not the kind of\na test you want to go into,\n\n230\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.360\nand never have taken an exam before.\n\n231\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.010\nAnd have test anxiety\nexplode in your face.\n\n232\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.700\nSo as I said, four hours should be\nplenty of time to answer the questions.\n\n233\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.930\nAlthough, I would advise you to use all\nof that time in reviewing your answers.\n\n234\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.670\nMost of the time your\nfirst answer is correct.\n\n235\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.710\nYour first choice of an answer is correct.\n\n236\n00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.570\nBut there are times when you go back, you\nmay read a question and go now I remember.\n\n237\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.360\nAnd go back to that previous question.\n\n238\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.510\n>> I would encourage you to do that\nbecause again, there's only 150 questions,\n\n239\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.580\nyou've gotta get enough to pass the exam.\n\n240\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.400\nSo use that time at the end to go back.\n\n241\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.550\nWrite yourself notes in\nthe margins of the pages.\n\n242\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.700\nThat's a really good way to remember\nthings after you've answered\n\n243\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.654\nanother 100 questions, you come back to\n25 and you go gosh, what was I thinking?\n\n244\n00:13:37.654 --> 00:13:39.834\n[LAUGH] I can't remember now.\n\n245\n00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:41.120\nSo write in your test booklet.\n\n246\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.890\nThat's completely legitimate.\n\n247\n00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.450\nThey will collect the test\nbooklets when you're done.\n\n248\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.380\nIf they suspect there's been any\ntype of cheating or misbehavior,\n\n249\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.190\nthey'll use that workbook for\ninvestigation.\n\n250\n00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.870\nSo that's one of the other\nreasons they collect all that.\n\n251\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.390\n>> I said complete all of your questions,\n\n252\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.790\nmake sure you do that and\nI just blanked a second ago.\n\n253\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.975\nThe one thing that frustrates students\nprobably the most with this whole process\n\n254\n00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:15.555\nit will take ISACA eight weeks to score\nyour exam and send you the results.\n\n255\n00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:18.070\n>> Hm.\n>> And when I say eight weeks, to the day.\n\n256\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.245\n>> [LAUGH] Really?\n\n257\n00:14:19.245 --> 00:14:20.900\n>> You'll get an email at eight weeks.\n\n258\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fretting about it and\n\n259\n00:14:23.955 --> 00:14:26.516\nasking them about it\nwon't change anything.\n\n260\n00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:28.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In eight weeks it will show up and\n\n261\n00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:30.810\nit's really frustrating.\n\n262\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:36.830\nAnd what's even more frustrating to\nsome folks is to get your certification,\n\n263\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.630\nthen, you can't file your paper until\nyou get your scores, obviously.\n\n264\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.210\nCuz you don't know your pass.\n\n265\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.710\nBut passing doesn't get\nyour certification.\n\n266\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.490\nThen there's still paperwork\nthat has to be filled out.\n\n267\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.750\nAnd you have to get signatures and\nyou send that out.\n\n268\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.650\nAnd that takes another eight\nweeks from when they received it.\n\n269\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.270\n>> Wow!.\n\n270\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.550\n>> So\nit can easily be 16 to 24 weeks after you\n\n271\n00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.670\ntake your exam before you\nactually get your certification.\n\n272\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.430\n>> Interesting.\n\n273\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.360\n>> So keep that in mind,\nit's not a Microsoft thing or\n\n274\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.410\nan IC squared thing where you\n>> Pass the test and, bingo,\n\n275\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.360\nyou got your certed.\n\n276\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.030\nIt does not work that way with.\n\n277\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:16.000\nThey're very thorough on reviewing\ntheir candidates' information and\n\n278\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.960\napplications, etc.\n\n279\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.840\nAnd they will go through\nthings very carefully.\n\n280\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.880\n>> Very good.\n\n281\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.696\nStuff like that, [SOUND] excuse me,\nit might be frustrating, but in the end,\n\n282\n00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:29.280\nit makes sure that the people that\nhave this certification warranted and\n\n283\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.648\nin my opinion makes it\nthat much more valuable.\n\n284\n00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:33.040\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n285\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.010\nThat's why the difference in the pay\ndifferential let you see between folks who\n\n286\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.760\nare doing audit with or without their\nCISA is roughly 20 to 25% bump.\n\n287\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.720\n>> Wow, nice.\n>> So it's pretty substantial.\n\n288\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.350\n>> I can wait 20 weeks for that.\n\n289\n00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.251\n>> The last thing I wanna bring up was I'd\n\n291\n00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:54.269\nlike to show everybody the ISACA website.\nIf you have not, I assume that you've\n\n292\n00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:59.026\nregistered for the exam, that's why\nyou're watching this video, if not,\n\n293\n00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:03.855\nyou're really running late [LAUGH] I think\nyou may not be able to take the exam But\n\n294\n00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:05.904\nI would want to encourage each and\n\n295\n00:16:05.904 --> 00:16:10.370\nevery one of you to join ISACA as\nyour professional association.\n\n296\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.840\nYou don't have to be a member\nto hold you cert, but\n\n297\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.720\nit certainly has a lot of benefit.\n\n298\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.236\nThis is the website, you can take a look\nat all the stuff that's going on, and\n\n299\n00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:24.118\nI recently just passed, I'm the president\nof the Indiana State Chapter of ISACA.\n\n300\n00:16:24.118 --> 00:16:28.763\nAnd was recently awarded a grant to\ngo to Lisbon, Portugal to a four day\n\n301\n00:16:28.763 --> 00:16:34.750\nleadership conference that didn't cost\nme anything, ISACA paid for all of it.\n\n302\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.390\nI chose not to do that for\nsome family reasons at the last minute but\n\n303\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.120\none of my other board members,\nour secretary, Jason James,\n\n304\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.010\nactually when to Lisbon Portugal, for four\ndays with his wife had an absolute blast.\n\n305\n00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.770\nISACA has these leadership conferences\nall over the world all the time and\n\n306\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.450\nthey often times pay for\nboard members to attend.\n\n307\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.510\nSo not only would I\nencourage you to join and\n\n308\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:04.210\nget involved in the organization because\nwe have over 118,000 members worldwide.\n\n309\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.110\nI think it's something like 85 countries.\n\n310\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.080\nI can't remember the exact\nnumber of countries but\n\n311\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.700\nit's over 118,000 members worldwide.\n\n312\n00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.840\nAnd get involved in your local chapter.\n\n313\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.760\nWhether that be in Indiana, or\nWisconsin, or California or whatever.\n\n314\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.310\nOnce you join, you can find your local\nchapter information on the ISACA website.\n\n315\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.760\nBecome a member.\n\n316\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.470\nGet involved in your local chapter.\n\n317\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.560\nWe typically have monthly\ntrainings with topics of interest.\n\n318\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.560\nWhether they be around security,\nsecurity audit, IT audit, risk management.\n\n319\n00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.260\nWe have folks from all different\nindustries come in and\n\n320\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.790\nspeak to our membership.\n\n321\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:47.530\nIf you wind up serving in\ncommittee capacities or\n\n322\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.470\non the board, you can earn CPEs.\n\n323\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.950\nThat's the other side of\ngetting your certifications.\n\n324\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.360\nOnce you get it, you will be\nrequired to obtain a minimum of 120\n\n325\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.730\nCPEs over the course of 3 years in\norder to keep that certification.\n\n326\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.530\nOr you have to retake your exams.\n\n327\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.090\nSo it's a great way to earn CPEs for free.\n\n328\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.600\nOur meetings, for instance,\nwe meet once a month.\n\n329\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.348\nAnd we have pizza.\n\n330\n00:18:10.348 --> 00:18:13.200\nAnd everybody gets,\nwe have 40 or 50 people show up.\n\n331\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.870\nSponsors paid for the pizza.\n\n332\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.100\nWe have a presentation.\n\n333\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.910\nEverybody gets a couple of CPEs.\n\n334\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.050\nThat's a great way to network with\nother auditing professionals.\n\n335\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.533\nWe're also just starting up a new\ninitiative where we're really pushing\n\n336\n00:18:25.533 --> 00:18:27.620\nthings more down more\nto the college level.\n\n337\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.870\nAnd trying to get college students\ninvolved in the audit industry.\n\n338\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.040\nAnd encouraging student\nchapters to get started and\n\n339\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.700\nbring them into chapters, as well.\n\n340\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.540\nSo then the one last thing I wanted to\nmention too, just off the cuff, was, so\n\n341\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:50.490\nnot only am I involved in ISACA, being the\npresident for the state chapter, but I'm\n\n342\n00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.280\nalso involved with another organization\nyou can see from my desktop here.\n\n343\n00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.060\nThe little Infragard logo over here.\n\n344\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.680\nFor those of you who don't know,\nMike let me put a little pitch out here.\n\n345\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.370\nInfragard is a private,public\npartnership with the FBI.\n\n346\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.930\nI'm the president of the state chapter.\n\n347\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.030\nWe have over 1,000 members.\n\n348\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.000\nBy the way, we have 600 members\nin ISACA for the state.\n\n349\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.250\n>> Wow.\n>> We have 1,000 members in Infragard.\n\n350\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.840\nAnd basically we do a lot of\nthe same kinds of activities\n\n351\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.110\nas ISACA except it's more around\nproviding cyber intelligence\n\n352\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:26.510\nactivities to the FBI surrounding the 16\ncritical infrastructures in the US.\n\n353\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.570\nFinancial services, water and energy,\n\n354\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.190\ncritical manufacturing, transportation,\ncommunication, stuff like that.\n\n355\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.700\nGreat op,\ngreat organization to belong to and\n\n356\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.460\nit just happens to be\non my screen desktop.\n\n357\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.270\n>> Well, thank you, Brian, a lot of\ngreat information there helping us make\n\n358\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.260\nsure that we're properly prepared when\nwe get ready to sit that exam, right?\n\n359\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.630\nWe've gotta do our studying.\n\n360\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.950\nWe've gotta prepare.\n\n361\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.826\nGood to have an idea of what to\nexpect when we do get registered.\n\n362\n00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:55.530\nAnd some great resources there.\n\n363\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.145\nWe look at that ISACA web page.\n\n364\n00:19:57.145 --> 00:20:01.289\nInfragard, both of these are find\nthat chapter in your area join,\n\n365\n00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:05.808\njoin the community, make the world\na better place is what we like to say.\n\n366\n00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:10.183\nSo we appreciate that, Brian,\nappreciate your time remember go out and\n\n367\n00:20:10.183 --> 00:20:12.836\npick up a copy of\nthe Sybex CISA study guide,\n\n368\n00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:15.648\nBrian O'hara one of\nthe authors of this book.\n\n369\n00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:18.116\nThis is the fourth edition,\nthe most current edition,\n\n370\n00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:21.685\nmake sure you get the right one and this\nis basically what

00:00:18.973\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nand today we're doing CISA,\n\n4\n00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:22.230\nor Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at domain one.\n\n6\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.562\nWhich really talks about\ndeveloping a set of procedures and\n\n7\n00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:35.042\na methodology that we can use in\nauditing that'll end up giving us\n\n8\n00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:40.860\nthe skill-set that we need to perform an\naudit on any given area in the IT world.\n\n9\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.720\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nBrian O'Hara.\n\n10\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.030\nHow are you doing, Brian?\n\n11\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.570\n>> I'm fine, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.515\nThanks for having me here again.\n\n13\n00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:52.603\nToday, we are gonna start off with\ntalking a little bit about the entry\n\n14\n00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:58.620\nlevel information in domain one, the\nprocess of auditing information systems.\n\n15\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.880\n[COUGH] And what I really wanna try and\naccomplish in this episode is to\n\n16\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.960\ntalk a little bit about some of\nthe constructs around what an audit is,\n\n17\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.600\nwhat an audit process looks like,\nhow it flows, etc.\n\n18\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.787\nHow is it built?\n\n19\n00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:17.110\nWhat's the purpose of an audit?\n\n20\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.770\nAnd what that process looks like.\n\n21\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.158\nSo to begin, I'd like to talk a little\nbit also about the format of this and\n\n22\n00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:29.031\nthe other episodes we're\ngonna be doing in the future.\n\n23\n00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:33.437\nBy taking a minute and talking\na little bit about the episode layout.\n\n24\n00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:37.503\nWe're gonna talk, we'll do a little\nintroduction to each session, or\n\n25\n00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:38.840\neach episode.\n\n26\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.200\nThen, we'll cover some key terms.\n\n27\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.870\nThen we'll talk about what ISACA calls\ntask statements and knowledge statements.\n\n28\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.520\nThese are very important in prepping for\nyour exam.\n\n29\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.948\nYou need to understand what those\nare about and how they tie together.\n\n30\n00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:55.010\nAnd then, we'll do maybe some\ntest questions depending\n\n31\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.874\non where we're at in the episode.\n\n32\n00:01:56.874 --> 00:02:00.398\nAnd then, also a summary of what\nwe've talked about during the day.\n\n33\n00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:03.900\nSo you kinda get a brief overview\nof what we're gonna talk about.\n\n34\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.970\nThen, we're gonna go talk about it,\n\n35\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.050\nand then we're gonna talk\nabout what we talked about.\n\n36\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.172\n>> Fantastic.\n\n37\n00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:10.680\nThey say when you're learning,\nand especially for\n\n38\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.481\nan exam like this where you say\nit is a lot of memorization.\n\n39\n00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:17.290\nIt's not me going in there and\nknowing what button to click or how to\n\n40\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.782\nrun that wizard or install DNS, it's\na lot of understanding these concepts,\n\n41\n00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:23.910\nbeing able to apply these concepts.\n\n42\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.285\nSo repetition is key when you're\ndoing any kind of memorization.\n\n43\n00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:31.966\nHearing it, hearing it more than once,\nand just that reiteration,\n\n44\n00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.670\nthat's really what makes it sink in.\n\n45\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.340\n>> Right.\n\n46\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.200\nAnd the reason I use the term\nconstructs is because that's really\n\n47\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.190\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n48\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.835\nWe're talking about understanding\nthe nomenclature, the concepts behind\n\n49\n00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:49.887\nthe constructs that ISACA has spent\nthe last 50 years developing.\n\n50\n00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:54.078\nSo I would assume that most students\nout there who have been in the audit\n\n51\n00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:57.701\nbusiness for a number of years\nhave done most of this but may or\n\n52\n00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:01.823\nmay not have a formal education\naround how the constructs are built,\n\n53\n00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:06.950\nwhat the concepts really are about,\nwhat their foundational purposes are.\n\n54\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.077\nAnd the complete process, because if\nyou've worked inside a particular company\n\n55\n00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:13.468\nfor 10 or\n15 years during internal audit for\n\n56\n00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:17.474\ninstance, you may not have the same\nexperience as someone who's done external\n\n57\n00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:19.834\naudits with a number of\ndifferent companies.\n\n58\n00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.460\nGetting exposed to different\nmanagement structures,\n\n59\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.280\ndifferent audit processes, etc.\n\n60\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.145\nAnd so, we need to be able to\nexplain to them the breath and\n\n61\n00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.600\nthe depth of those processes so\n\n62\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.290\nthat everybody has a good understanding\nof how the audit process actually works.\n\n63\n00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.440\n>> Very good.\n\n64\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.280\n>> So a couple of key terms\nthat I wanna talk about.\n\n65\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.750\nThe first obviously being certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n66\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.900\nWhat is an information system?\n\n67\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.918\nAn information system is really, we try to\nkeep it not specific to a computer, but\n\n68\n00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:53.159\nwhen we talk about information systems,\nwe're really talking about the hardware,\n\n69\n00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.454\nthe software, all the policies and\nthe procedures around running and\n\n70\n00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:02.439\nmanaging those applications that help us\ndo our day to day business activities.\n\n71\n00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.170\nOne example might be an electronic\nmedical records system in a hospital.\n\n72\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.870\nThat could involve hundreds of computers.\n\n73\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.300\nIt could involve hundreds of users,\nadministrators, etc.\n\n74\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.260\nThat's an information system and\nwe as auditors have to learn to\n\n75\n00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.140\nlook at those systems as a whole as\nwe go in to perform our audit tasks.\n\n76\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.590\n>> Yeah, I can see where it would be\neasy to fall in that trap of thinking.\n\n77\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.125\nA system is in this laptop.\n\n78\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:26.682\n>> Right.\n\n79\n00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:29.694\n>> When in fact that application you\nmight be looking at the front end\n\n80\n00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:32.650\nof that application but its got to\nreach back and hit a database or\n\n81\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.490\ngather information from other places and\nyou've got to look at the whole thing.\n\n82\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.100\n>> Correct.\n\n83\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.670\nAnd a great example of that when you talk\nabout databases is one of the things\n\n84\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.370\nthat's most important in financial\naudits which we won't be talking about.\n\n85\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.960\nThese are specific to IT systems,\nbut the same principles apply is\n\n86\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.840\nwhat we call completeness and\naccuracy of the transactional record.\n\n87\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.920\nSo as for being a SQL guy,\nwhenever you do a transaction with,\n\n88\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.410\nat least with Microsoft's SQL server,\nI don't know if I can say that or not.\n\n89\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.190\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n90\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.470\n>> With Microsoft's SQL server,\nit's a transactional occurrence and\n\n91\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.540\nso the record doesn't actually\nget written to the database until\n\n92\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.270\neverything's been verified and validated\nthat it is in fact correct and complete.\n\n93\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.150\nThen it gets written.\n\n94\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.728\n>> Otherwise we roll the whole thing back.\n\n95\n00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:16.350\n>> That's right.\nAnd\n\n96\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.440\nthe same thing happens\nin other IT systems.\n\n97\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.180\nThat's a large part of what we\nlook at is the completeness and\n\n98\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.910\naccuracy of transactional records, etc.\n\n99\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.830\nThere's a number of other things as well,\nbut it's important for\n\n100\n00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.720\nstudents out there to understand\nwhat an information system is.\n\n101\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.210\nIt's not necessarily just a computer.\n\n102\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.090\nToday, with the advent of cloud systems,\nthat's taken on a whole new meaning when\n\n103\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.360\nyou're doing auditing of\nCloud Information Systems.\n\n104\n00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.280\nI'm working on a project right now that's\n\n105\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.240\nstate government trying to obtain\nwhat's called FedRAMP certification.\n\n106\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.120\nAnd we have to look at what our actual\nboundaries are in the information system.\n\n107\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.210\nWe actually have to clearly define those.\n\n108\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.060\nIt's very complicated.\n\n109\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.676\n>> Should be challenging.\n\n110\n00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:55.198\nYes.\n\n111\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:55.836\n>> Yeah, very challenging.\n\n112\n00:05:55.836 --> 00:06:03.012\nSo [COUGH] the next is standard.\n\n113\n00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:05.430\nI wanna talk a little bit\nabout what standards are.\n\n114\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.500\nAnd my best example of this are the\nPayment Council Industry standards or\n\n115\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.960\nPCI standards.\n\n116\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.890\nSome of the students may or may not have\nheard of that before depending on whether\n\n117\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.670\nthey've worked in that arena or not.\n\n118\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.000\nAnd I use that because PCI is not\na state or federal law or regulation.\n\n119\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.980\nIt's a contractual obligation\nbetween payer and payee, etc.\n\n120\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.300\nBut they've done a great job of\ndefining what they call the PCI DSS or\n\n121\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.580\nData Security Standards.\n\n122\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.250\nStandards are things that must be met.\n\n123\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.943\nThey're not something you can bypass,\nthey're not something you can go,\n\n124\n00:06:39.943 --> 00:06:41.279\nwell we did 20% of that.\n\n125\n00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A standard is a standard.\n\n126\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.920\nThat is something that has to be met.\n\n127\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.460\nAnd everything that we do in\nthe audit process will revolve around\n\n128\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.290\ninsuring that our information systems\nare meeting whatever standards are being\n\n129\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.050\napplied to them.\n\n130\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.010\nThose standards could be\nlots of different things.\n\n131\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.170\nIt could be PCI,\nit could be a whole host of other things.\n\n132\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.990\nWe may even write our own standards.\n\n133\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.820\nCould be federal, etc.\n\n134\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.340\nBut one of the important pieces of\nthe auditor process is to ensure that our\n\n135\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.120\ninformation systems\nare meeting those standards.\n\n136\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.000\nAnd if they're not,\nwe need to be able to call that out and\n\n137\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.169\nmake recommendations to\nmanagement in order for\n\n138\n00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.433\nthem to meet those standards, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:25.476\n>> Okay.\n\n140\n00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:26.776\n>> Next will be guidelines.\n\n141\n00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:30.070\nThese are key terms that you need to\nunderstand the differences between.\n\n142\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.180\nStandards being mandatory,\nthose are things you must be doing.\n\n143\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.020\nGuidelines really\nare operational preferences.\n\n144\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.830\nSo your guidelines may\nsay 70% of X must occur.\n\n145\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.522\nIt's not necessarily a standard,\nthey're just guidelines.\n\n146\n00:07:48.522 --> 00:07:52.812\nAnd it's important to understand\nthe difference because you may see both\n\n147\n00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:55.579\nstandards and\nguidelines in the audit world and\n\n148\n00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:59.545\nit's important to understand\nthe distinction between those two.\n\n149\n00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:02.707\nAnother key term that we need to\ntalk about, for just a minute,\n\n150\n00:08:02.707 --> 00:08:04.806\nis computer assisted audit technology.\n\n151\n00:08:04.806 --> 00:08:11.070\nBasically, what we're talking about\nis automated auditing software, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.250\nThat's a whole new industry,\nI shouldn't say new industry.\n\n153\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.301\nIt's been around for a while,\nbut it's evolving very rapidly.\n\n154\n00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:22.531\nI've worked with a number of products\nthat are designed to do that.\n\n155\n00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:26.492\nThe challenge with using computer\nassisted audit techniques and\n\n156\n00:08:26.492 --> 00:08:30.958\ntechnologies are being careful that\nthe computer assisted techniques or\n\n157\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.365\ntechnology themselves don't introduce\nmore errors than doing things manually.\n\n158\n00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:41.570\nBut the point is you can audit a larger\nnumber of things or processes or\n\n159\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.340\npolicies or procedures using those\nkind of computer assisted techniques.\n\n160\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.689\n>> And I'm inferring with that name,\ncomputer assisted,\n\n161\n00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:54.678\nit's not like the computer or\nthe software is doing the entire job.\n\n162\n00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:57.020\n>> Right.\n>> Which is giving you some assistance.\n\n163\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.430\n>> Right, so for instance,\nwe often use what we call GRC or\n\n164\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.450\ngovernance regulatory and\ncompliance tools software.\n\n165\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.065\nThat help us pull together policies and\ndo control testing and things like that.\n\n166\n00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.401\nThat generate reports for\n\n167\n00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:13.460\nus automatically rather than us having\nto generate those things manually.\n\n168\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.755\n>> Okay.\n>> In really large complex environments\n\n169\n00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:19.735\nthose become a lot more important than\nthey are in smaller environments.\n\n170\n00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:22.795\nSo those are some of the key\nterms to talk about.\n\n171\n00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.530\nSo now, I'd like to go and\ntalk a little bit about\n\n172\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.530\nthe first set of knowledge statements,\nthat ISACA talks about in domain one.\n\n173\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.850\nThe first being that, in a knowledge\nstatement being, this is something that\n\n174\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.070\nthey expect the information system auditor\nto understand and be able to apply.\n\n175\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.225\nThat's what a knowledge\nstatement is about.\n\n176\n00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:50.679\n1.1 of ISACA assumes that the student\nunderstands the ISACA Audit and\n\n177\n00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:57.230\nAssurance Standards, Guidelines,\nand Tools and Techniques.\n\n178\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.271\nThose are all available on\nthe ISACA website, www.isaca.org.\n\n179\n00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.719\nIf you're not a member already\nbefore you take the exam,\n\n180\n00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:07.983\nI would suggest you become a member,\ngo ahead and pay your membership fees,\n\n181\n00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:10.205\nbecause it will get you\naccess to these documents.\n\n182\n00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:13.226\n>> Yeah.\n>> They actually have white papers that\n\n183\n00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:15.989\nyou can download, specific tools and\n\n184\n00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:19.450\ndocuments on techniques\nthat you can use on it.\n\n185\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.970\nIt's a wealth of resources for members, so\nI'd strongly encourage you to go ahead and\n\n186\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:30.278\njoin ISACA now, before you take the exam\nso you can begin tapping those resources.\n\n187\n00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:34.132\nGreat, great set of resources that\nthey have available for students.\n\n188\n00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:37.840\n>> All right Brian, so\ntell me a little bit about\n\n189\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.950\nhow the IT Audit process\nhelps us manage our risk.\n\n190\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.060\n>> That's a good question, Mike.\n\n191\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.612\nThanks for asking.\n\n192\n00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:44.144\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n193\n00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:49.058\nI'd like to talk now a little bit about\na couple of different types of risk, and\n\n194\n00:10:49.058 --> 00:10:52.760\nthen I'll talk some about testing and\nsampling methods.\n\n195\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.210\nBut before we get to that, what I really\nwant to talk about is the whole idea\n\n196\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.760\nof performing IT systems audits,\nis about managing risk.\n\n197\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.730\nThat's really what our business is about.\n\n198\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.230\nIt's not about check boxes,\n\n199\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.555\nit's not about making sure that people are\ndoing what they say they're doing, etc.\n\n200\n00:11:09.555 --> 00:11:11.966\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's really about managing risk for\n\n201\n00:11:11.966 --> 00:11:13.070\nthe organization.\n\n202\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.400\nWe're gonna talk a lot later on in\nother episodes about IT strategy and\n\n203\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.690\nhow your risk management\nprocesses all relate to that.\n\n204\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.886\nBut it really boils down\nto how do we manage risk?\n\n205\n00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:26.345\nAnd to do that we have to talk a little\nbit about first about what risk is and\n\n206\n00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:30.260\nwhat the different kinds of risk are and\nhow they all play into this whole process,\n\n207\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.775\nso we're gonna start off with that.\n\n208\n00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.823\nSoI want to talk a little bit,\nsome more key terms for\n\n209\n00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:40.325\nyou to make notes about,\nwhat is audit risk?\n\n210\n00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.462\nI'd ask the audience,\nif anyone want to test the next-\n\n211\n00:11:42.462 --> 00:11:44.700\n>> That's a great question.\n\n212\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.800\n>> What audit risk is?\n\n213\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.380\nAudit risk is the risk that\n\n214\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.960\nyou may miss some material finding\nin you audit efforts, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.530\nAnd if you were to do that,\nthat risk would then be transferred\n\n216\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.160\nto the company that you're working with,\nthe organization you're working with.\n\n217\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.595\nWhich means that if I forget something or\nI don't do a proper job of,\n\n218\n00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:05.552\nI don't use proper sampling methods or\ntesting methods,\n\n219\n00:12:05.552 --> 00:12:08.830\nI'm leaving risk behind without\nbeing addressed adequately.\n\n220\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.640\nAnd therefore, I put the company\nthat I'm working with at risk.\n\n221\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.730\nSo it's very important that you\ntake a look at audit risk and\n\n222\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.570\nunderstand what that term means.\n\n223\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.328\nYou can find most of these\ndefinitions in our book.\n\n224\n00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:24.624\nThe Wylie CICA Study Guide as well as\nmore information on the definitions,\n\n225\n00:12:24.624 --> 00:12:28.620\nbut I would strongly urge\nyou to read up on that.\n\n226\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.160\nThe next will be audit evidence.\n\n227\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.930\nThere's some confusion,\n\n228\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:38.240\nI've worked with a number of auditors over\nthe years about what audit evidence means.\n\n229\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.390\nTo me, audit evidence is anything\nyou discover, plain and simple,\n\n230\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.640\nwhether that be interview information\nthat you get from an interviewee,\n\n231\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.620\nwhether it be a document\nthat you get upon request.\n\n232\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.222\nAll of that is audit evidence and\nshould be stored accordingly.\n\n233\n00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:56.670\nAudit evidence typically\nis owned by the auditor or\n\n234\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.412\nthe audit company and\nit's stored hopefully, securely somewhere.\n\n235\n00:13:01.412 --> 00:13:03.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Password protected,\n\n236\n00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:06.470\nin a secure encrypted environment, etc,\n\n237\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.644\nwhatever your particular audit company's\npolicy and procedures dictate.\n\n238\n00:13:11.644 --> 00:13:14.416\nBut that audit evidence\nshould be protected and\n\n239\n00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:18.167\nit should not be shared with\nanyone outside your organization.\n\n240\n00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:22.576\nIt's very sensitive information,\nit could be damaging if released to\n\n241\n00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:26.700\nthe public in which case you\ncan be held liable etc, etc.\n\n242\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.990\nSo audit evidence is anything you\ncollect during the course of your audit\n\n243\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.050\nexperience, whether that be just stuff\nthat you write down on a piece of paper\n\n244\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.260\nfrom an interview, documents that\nyou gather from your interviewees or\n\n245\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.110\npolicies and procedures that\nthe company's written, etc.\n\n246\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.689\n>> So really then Bryan,\nany kind of output,\n\n247\n00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:49.859\nalmost like the output of the audit\nprocess becomes audit evidence.\n\n248\n00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:52.070\n>> Correct, correct.\n\n249\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.680\nThe next item we want to talk\nabout is the audit program.\n\n250\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.581\nWhat is an audit program?\n\n251\n00:13:56.581 --> 00:14:00.317\nISACA calls the audit program a step\nby step set of audit procedures and\n\n252\n00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:04.230\ninstructions that should be\nperformed to complete an audit.\n\n253\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.767\nSo in other words, it's a comprehensive\nset of steps designed to ensure\n\n254\n00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:15.031\nthat you cover all your basis when\nyou're an audit that you obtain and\n\n255\n00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:19.596\nmanage store adequately etc,\nall of your audit evidence.\n\n256\n00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:23.436\nAnd that you don't make any material\nerrors in your audit to rule out any\n\n257\n00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:24.460\naudit risk.\n\n258\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.035\nThat's really what your\naudit program is about.\n\n259\n00:14:26.035 --> 00:14:29.270\n>> So the audit program can help\nus minimize the audit risk.\n\n260\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.440\n>> Correct, correct.\n\n261\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.510\nThat's what it's designed to do.\n\n262\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.560\nNext, I wanna talk a little\nbit about testing methods.\n\n263\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.320\nThat is an area where\nmany younger auditors\n\n264\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.700\nwho aren't as experienced get\na little bit sideways sometimes.\n\n265\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.398\nThere's basically two\ntypes of testing methods.\n\n266\n00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:49.360\nWe're gonna talk about sampling\nmethods in a minute, but\n\n267\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.273\ntesting methods there's compliance and\nsubstantive.\n\n268\n00:14:52.273 --> 00:14:57.395\nCompliance testing is basically\ntesting to see whether or\n\n269\n00:14:57.395 --> 00:15:00.640\nnot you meet a compliance standard.\n\n270\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.890\nSo PCI standard, for\ninstance that would be compliance testing.\n\n271\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.780\nSubstantive testing might be something\nlike an Active Directory username and\n\n272\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.790\npassword supposed to be 12 characters,\ncomplex, etc.\n\n273\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.314\nThat's not necessary,\nyou're not necessarily testing it for\n\n274\n00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:21.328\ncompliance as much as you are for\nwhether or\n\n275\n00:15:21.328 --> 00:15:26.457\nnot it's actually being implemented,\nit's a different thing there.\n\n276\n00:15:26.457 --> 00:15:28.769\nWhen we talk about sampling methods,\n\n277\n00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.538\nattribute sampling methods and\nvariable sampling methods.\n\n278\n00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:40.732\nLet me see if I can find a note here\nabout what ISACA says on those.\n\n279\n00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:41.801\nYeah, I can't find that, sorry.\n\n280\n00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:44.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll come back to that.\n\n281\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.901\n>> We'll come back to that.\n\n282\n00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:45.621\n>> Yeah, but\n\n283\n00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.592\nagain those concepts are talked about\nin further detail both in the book.\n\n284\n00:15:50.592 --> 00:15:55.437\nAnd again on the ISACA website which\nagain, I would encourage you to\n\n285\n00:15:55.437 --> 00:16:00.112\njoin ISACA, get your membership\nup to date because there are more\n\n286\n00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:04.874\ntools techniques white papers\ndocuments etc., on the website.\n\n287\n00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:08.839\nThat you can access once you become\na member that will help you with this,\n\n288\n00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:12.100\nincluding the task guidelines,\nall the standards, etc.\n\n289\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.060\nSo now let's move on, talk a little bit,\nas I mentioned earlier,\n\n290\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.600\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about task\nstatements and then knowledge statements.\n\n291\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.020\nSo as I mentioned in the opening part of\nthe episode, we're really beginning to\n\n292\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.090\ntalk about how audit is designed\nto manage risk in an organization.\n\n293\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.100\nThe first task statement is that the CISA\n\n294\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.920\ncandidate should be able to\nexecute a risk-based audit, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.540\nThat means you're doing an audit\nthat the outcome of which will help\n\n296\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.450\nthe organization manage\ntheir risk more effectively.\n\n297\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:50.400\nYou need to be able to know\nhow to plan specific audits.\n\n298\n00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.346\nSo if you're doing a PCI audit or\na HIPAA audit or,\n\n299\n00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:57.976\nwe won't get into financial audits, but\nif you were doing a financial audit,\n\n300\n00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:02.186\nthere are different things required for\neach of those to ensure that you\n\n301\n00:17:02.186 --> 00:17:05.378\nare complete and\naccurate in your audit activities.\n\n302\n00:17:05.378 --> 00:17:10.708\nAnd then you also should be able to\nconduct your audits in accordance\n\n303\n00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:15.620\nwith the IS audits standards\nthat ISACA has established.\n\n304\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.110\nAnd again, you can download a copy\nof those from the ISACA.org website.\n\n305\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.274\nI would suggest that you review those.\n\n306\n00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:26.335\nI don't know that there will be any\nspecific material on those on the exam,\n\n307\n00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:29.565\nbut they're still a good item for\nyou to know about, okay.\n\n308\n00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:32.860\n>> Very good.\n\n309\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.830\n>> You'll need to understand\nthe risk assessment concepts and\n\n310\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.000\nagain, tools and techniques which\nare available on the ISACA website.\n\n311\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.523\nIf you go to their ISACA.org, you'll see\nthere's actually a section called tools,\n\n312\n00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:52.291\ntips and techniques that you can download,\nwhite papers, PowerPoints,\n\n313\n00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.805\nPDFs, etc., for more information.\n\n314\n00:17:54.805 --> 00:17:58.430\nYou must have a knowledge of risk based\naudit planning and project management.\n\n315\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.880\nThis is where for\n\n316\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.810\nthe very first time ISACA introduces\nthe idea of project management.\n\n317\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.099\nThey get a lot more into detail in\nthat in the CISM certification but\n\n318\n00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:10.810\nin the CISA certification it's\nintroduced for the first time.\n\n319\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.910\nThat the audit is a project in itself and\n\n320\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:19.240\nyou have to become familiar with\nbasic project management concepts.\n\n321\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.170\nIt's not a real heavy\npiece of the exam but\n\n322\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.830\nyou do need to understand that what you\nare managing is an audit, is a project.\n\n323\n00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.475\nAnd you'll even hear me talk later about\nthe IT project portfolio where you\n\n324\n00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:34.728\nmay have multiple audits\ngoing on simultaneously.\n\n325\n00:18:34.728 --> 00:18:39.016\nThe portfolio is the higher level view\nof all the different audits that might\n\n326\n00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:39.820\nbe going on.\n\n327\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.710\nA good example is in banking.\n\n328\n00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.790\nBanks typically undergo both IT and\nfinancial audits on an ongoing and\n\n329\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.628\ncontinuing basis round the calendar.\n\n330\n00:18:51.628 --> 00:18:54.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A small bank might go through 12 or\n\n331\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.170\n15 audits in a year.\n\n332\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.563\n>> Wow!\n>> You might not realize that.\n\n333\n00:18:57.563 --> 00:18:59.491\n>> Uh-uh.\n>> That there's almost constantly auditors\n\n334\n00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.060\nin there, and\na larger bank it's almost continuous.\n\n335\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.180\nThere's almost never not\nan audit team sitting on site.\n\n336\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.456\nAnd those audit teams could be anywhere\nfrom 1 or 2 people to 10 or 12,\n\n337\n00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:11.230\ndepending on the size of the organization.\n\n338\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:16.110\nI went through an extensive FDIC\naudit with a large national bank\n\n339\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.220\nin the first part of last year.\n\n340\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.151\nAnd there were actually nine FDIC and\nFFIC and\n\n341\n00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:26.470\nFederal Reserve auditors on site for\n30 days.\n\n342\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.044\n>> Wow.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:19:28.044 --> 00:19:30.570\n>> That was quite an experience,\n\n344\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.770\nboth learning and educationally wise.\n\n345\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.640\nAnd then, the one of the last things,\nnot the last completely, but\n\n346\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.080\nyou should begin becoming\nfamiliar with applicable laws,\n\n347\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.180\nsuch as HIPAA,\nFFIC guidelines for the banks.\n\n348\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.189\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nis actually the law.\n\n349\n00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.952\nFFIC is who promulgates\nthe regulations for banking.\n\n350\n00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:59.131\nYou just need to start becoming familiar\nwith those because when you go in and\n\n351\n00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:03.768\nyou start doing your audits, you are going\nto be auditing against those standards or\n\n352\n00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:05.598\nthose policies and procedures,\n\n353\n00:20:05.598 --> 00:20:10.000\ndepending on the organization that\nyou're doing your audit activities with.\n\n354\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.220\nMost auditing activities happen around,\nprobably the three largest are banking,\n\n355\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.510\nhealthcare, so FFIC and HIPAA and PCI.\n\n356\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.060\nVery little manufacturing\nunless it has to do with FDA or\n\n357\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.090\nsome kind of federal government stuff.\n\n358\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.973\nSame thing with state government if they\nare doing any business with the federal\n\n359\n00:20:27.973 --> 00:20:28.498\ngovernment.\n\n360\n00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:31.082\nThere may be FISMA or\nFedRAMP regulations involved.\n\n361\n00:20:31.082 --> 00:20:34.621\nBut it's important that you begin to\nbecome familiar with those terms.\n\n362\n00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:39.058\nYou won't necessarily need to be\nable to define them in the exam or\n\n363\n00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:42.367\nanswer questions specifically about them,\nbut\n\n364\n00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:46.560\nyou may see a reference to\nwhich of these is not a law.\n\n365\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.900\nAnswer, PCI.\n\n366\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.870\nPCI is a contractual agreement.\n\n367\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.550\nHIPAA actually is an act.\n\n368\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.150\nThat's what one of the A's in there\nstands for is an act of Congress.\n\n369\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.098\nSo it is in fact law.\n\n370\n00:20:58.098 --> 00:21:02.308\nSo moving on.\n\n371\n00:21:02.308 --> 00:21:07.092\nAnd then have some knowledge of\ncollection techniques which I\n\n372\n00:21:07.092 --> 00:21:10.410\nwant to bullet point for\nyou all right now.\n\n373\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.240\nThese become important because\nyou probably have done them or\n\n374\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.329\nwill do them, but you haven't\nreally identified or labeled them.\n\n375\n00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:20.900\nAnd they go like this.\n\n376\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.168\nObservation, and\nI always call this a walk-through.\n\n377\n00:21:24.168 --> 00:21:27.420\nA good old friend of mine\nwho is a CPA taught me this.\n\n378\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.830\nA walk-through, an observation,\n\n379\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.870\nis where you actually ask someone,\nshow me how you do that.\n\n380\n00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.680\nShow me how you create an Active Directory\naccount, or show me the group policy that\n\n381\n00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.580\nsays your passwords have to be 12\ncharacters, complex, etc., show me that.\n\n382\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.320\nThat's an observational one.\n\n383\n00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.912\nAn inquiry is when, this was [LAUGH] in\ndays gone by, in banking in particular,\n\n384\n00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:53.941\nhad a kind of a bad reputation for\nbeing, that was 98% of the audit.\n\n385\n00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:56.410\nYou sat down in a room with somebody\nwith their spreadsheet, and\n\n386\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.410\nthey started asking you questions.\n\n387\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.025\nAnd, in fact,\nI have a little side story to tell about.\n\n388\n00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:06.210\nA bank president at one time,\nwho had been a Department of\n\n389\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.380\nIndiana Financial Institution examiner at\none point, told me a story about a young\n\n390\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.600\nlady who was a new auditor who\ndidn't have any experience at all.\n\n391\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.530\nThe firm sent her out on her first job.\n\n392\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.570\nAnd she would ask him a question, and\nhe would say, I'm sorry, young lady, but\n\n393\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.940\nI don't understand you.\n\n394\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.819\n>> And\nshe would simply ask the question louder.\n\n395\n00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:27.464\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So inquiry is one of those and\n\n396\n00:22:27.464 --> 00:22:30.730\nI know we're starting to\nrun a little bit over here.\n\n397\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.050\n>> You're fine.\n\n398\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:37.060\n>> We have inspection, interview, and\n\n399\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.270\ndata analysis, and\nforensic investigations.\n\n400\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.130\nSo data analysis may be,\n\n401\n00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:47.700\nand we'll talk a little bit about\nsampling techniques and methodologies.\n\n402\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.760\nData analysis may involve,\nyou have 100 employees.\n\n403\n00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.820\nI wanna poll 20% randomly and I wanna see\nwhen their passwords were changed last.\n\n404\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.710\nOr you have a policy that all employees\n\n405\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.882\nhave a background check done\non them prior to hiring.\n\n406\n00:23:04.882 --> 00:23:08.840\nI'm gonna pull a random\nsample of your HR files for\n\n407\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.580\nthe last 12 months, or\nhaphazard sample, excuse me.\n\n408\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.780\nAnd review those to see if they actually\ndid in fact occur before the hiring\n\n409\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.610\nevent occurred, things like that.\n\n410\n00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.530\nForensic investigation gets\na little more complex.\n\n411\n00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:28.390\nThat typically is not something that\nauditors do without specialized training.\n\n412\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.470\nIt's not part of the CISA\nresponsibilities.\n\n413\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.060\nForensic investigations and\nforensic audits are oftentimes handed off\n\n414\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.970\nto specialists once a finding\nis discovered that says,\n\n415\n00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.050\nhey, we need to have somebody\nspecialized taking a look at this.\n\n416\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.100\nAnd then lastly, I'll close up\nthis episode with talking about\n\n417\n00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.070\nsampling methodologies and techniques.\n\n418\n00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:58.600\nWe talked a little bit about attribute and\nvariable testing, or excuse me, sampling.\n\n419\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.940\nAn example of attribute\nsampling might be looking at\n\n420\n00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.550\nall of a certain type of machine, a server\n2003 or sever 2008 something like that,\n\n421\n00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:15.380\nto see whether or not they have the same\nbaseline configuration done on them.\n\n422\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.851\nAnd the other, the variable,\n\n423\n00:24:17.851 --> 00:24:23.753\nwould be simply picking randomly\nacross systems, something like that.\n\n424\n00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:25.029\n>> Very good.\n\n425\n00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.974\n>> So.\n\n426\n00:24:25.974 --> 00:24:30.010\n>> All right, Brian, I tell ya, a lot of\ninformation there as we get started with\n\n427\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.900\nour dive into the world of the CISA.\n\n428\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.370\nYou really have to understand what\nis meant by an audit and understand\n\n429\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.750\nwhy we're doing it and the standards and\nthe methodologies that we've gotta have in\n\n430\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.610\nplace to ensure that we're doing a good\njob and we're not missing anything.\n\n431\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.760\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n432\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.460\n>> You're welcome.\n\n433\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.420\n>> Hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed

00:00:17.068\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:20.960\ntoday we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.480\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be continuing on in domain one and\n\n6\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.950\nwe're gonna start branching\ninto audit reporting.\n\n7\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.635\nAnd here to help me in today's episode\nis the author of the CISA Study Guide,\n\n8\n00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:34.880\nMr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.090\nHow are you doing Brian?\n\n10\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.780\n>> Hi Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.880\nThanks for having me again.\n\n12\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.380\n>> Absolutely.\n\n13\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.570\n>> So today I'd like to do just a little\nquick review over what we talked about in\n\n14\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.580\npart one of this particular domain.\n\n15\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.160\nWe talked a little bit about audit risk,\n\n16\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.910\nand audit evidence,\nhow to collect audit evidence, etc.\n\n17\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.650\nAnd we started for\n\n18\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.080\nthe first time talking about what\nthe audit program actually looks like.\n\n19\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.290\nIn this episode, what I'd like to talk\na little bit about, which is really,\n\n20\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.548\nreally, a very important\ncomponent of this whole course,\n\n21\n00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:09.330\nand the CISA knowledge base,\nis art reporting.\n\n22\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.584\nIt's the single most important piece,\nI think, of what an auditor does,\n\n23\n00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:17.176\nbecause all the future actions\nare based on the auto report..\n\n24\n00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:21.582\nSo it's important to understand\nhow your auto reports are built,\n\n25\n00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:26.080\nthe information contained in them,\nhow you go about getting them.\n\n26\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.920\nThat's where we're talking about\ntesting in the last episode.\n\n27\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.518\nThey're testing methodologies, etc.\n\n28\n00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:34.260\nSo I'm gonna give you\na little quick outline of\n\n29\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.810\nthe components of a good auto report.\n\n30\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.573\nSo for\nstudents out there take notes on this.\n\n31\n00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:43.161\nAnd then, we'll talk a little\nbit about the audit charter and\n\n32\n00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.550\nwhat that really means, and\nthen about generating findings.\n\n33\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.890\nSo to kick off with when you're\ncompiling your first audit report,\n\n34\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.040\nthere are a number of key headings that\nshould be included in any audit report.\n\n35\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.490\nThere should be an introduction.\n\n36\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.369\nThere should be an objectives section.\n\n37\n00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.084\nThere should be a limitations and\nscope section.\n\n38\n00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:09.410\nI'm gonna come back and talk a little\nbit about some of these, some more.\n\n39\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.565\nThe period that the audit covered, so\nfor instance the start and stop date,\n\n40\n00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:17.830\nthose are very important so that people\nknow exactly when you were there.\n\n41\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.158\nBecause an audit for those who do know,\nwho have done these already in the past,\n\n42\n00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.820\nis simply a snapshot of\nthe environment in time.\n\n43\n00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.890\nIt's not a reflection of\nnecessarily ongoing system status.\n\n44\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.170\nBut it is a snapshot picture.\n\n45\n00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.560\nSo having the limitation in scope\nof the audit is very important.\n\n46\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.140\nAs well as the period\nthat the audit covered.\n\n47\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.229\nThen, of course, the most important part\nis the audit findings, what exactly you\n\n48\n00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:49.334\ndiscovered, what your conclusions were\nbased on the findings that you obtained.\n\n49\n00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:54.237\nAnd then, any reservations you\nmight have to the audit results, so\n\n50\n00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:59.312\nfor instance, one of the things I might\nrun into is I might say that some\n\n51\n00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:04.301\nof my audit results were questionable\nbecause I was unable to acquire\n\n52\n00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:09.319\nadequate documentation on policies and\nprocedures from the staff.\n\n53\n00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.408\nEither because of a time limitation or\nperhaps even people were out sick, etc.,\n\n54\n00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:19.456\nor in some cases we have staff who like to\nkinda drag their feet and not cooperate.\n\n55\n00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:21.313\n>> [LAUGH] say it isn't so.\n\n56\n00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:22.253\n>> Yeah, as much as possible.\n\n57\n00:03:22.253 --> 00:03:25.829\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's always a section there for\n\n58\n00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.608\nauditor reservations.\n\n59\n00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:31.954\nBut I wanna go back and\ntalk a little bit about the objectives and\n\n60\n00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:33.929\nthe limitations and scope.\n\n61\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.580\nSo it's very important in\nan audit report to talk about\n\n62\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.790\nwhat kind of audit you're conducting, what\n\n63\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.610\nthe purpose is,\n\n64\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.280\nwho the stakeholders are that\nyou're writing the report for.\n\n65\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.460\nSo that basically when an executive picks\nup the document they can read it and\n\n66\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.970\nget a quick understanding of,\nas well as a detailed understanding,\n\n67\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.550\nof what exactly was found.\n\n68\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.490\nAnd in mentioning that, while\nthe ISACA model doesn't include this,\n\n69\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.730\nsomething that I've built into my reports\nfor years is an executive summary,\n\n70\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.060\nand that's important because, often times\nthese reports will go off the food chain\n\n71\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.290\nto higher management,\nhigher level management.\n\n72\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.970\nAnd they don't always understand\nthe specific of IT systems or\n\n73\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.610\naudit speak, if you will.\n\n74\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.519\nAnd it's important to be able\nto take your conclusions and\n\n75\n00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:38.823\nput them in a high level,\nsort of a high level summary in order for\n\n76\n00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:42.677\nupper management to understand\nwhat exactly happened.\n\n77\n00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:47.207\n>> So like if you know your audience you\ncan really cater that report to their\n\n78\n00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:48.330\nspecific needs.\n\n79\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.878\n>> Right and it's important because\nwe're continuing to stress more and\n\n80\n00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.666\nmore today in auditing,\nwe didn't so much in the past.\n\n81\n00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:56.847\nBut we're continuing to stress more and\n\n82\n00:04:56.847 --> 00:05:01.210\nmore executive management involvement\nin audit results and tracking.\n\n83\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.050\nNot so much the down in the weeds\nof how did it get done,\n\n84\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.940\nwhat was your sampling methodology,\nthey don't care about that.\n\n85\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.360\nBut the reality is because of the breaches\nin the news you read about all the time,\n\n86\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.066\nexecutives are getting more and\nmore pressure to have their fingers\n\n87\n00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:19.179\ninto the security world and know\nwhat's happening in their environment.\n\n88\n00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:22.938\nSo it's really important that you're able\nto communicate that effectively to upper\n\n89\n00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:25.310\nmanagement so that they know what to do.\n\n90\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.260\nThey know how to prioritize\ntheir resources or\n\n91\n00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.370\nwe live in a world of limited resources\nand we're constantly faced with challenges\n\n92\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.420\nregarding where to put those\nresources to best use.\n\n93\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.698\nSo in a risk based scenario for instance\nyou might have 12 different findings,\n\n94\n00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:46.593\nall with different risk\nratings from high to low.\n\n95\n00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:50.914\nYou'll have to be able to decide where\nyou're gonna put your resources to address\n\n96\n00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:52.750\nthose in a reasonable timeframe.\n\n97\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.570\nBased on the risk it poses\nto the organization.\n\n98\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.120\n>> Very good.\n>> So\n\n99\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.959\nthat's why in the previous episode\nwe talked so much about risk.\n\n100\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.860\nThere's more information\non it in the book.\n\n101\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.066\nThere's also more\ninformation at ISACA.org,\n\n102\n00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:09.820\nif you wanna read further\nin that particular manner.\n\n103\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.660\nIt's extremely important because\neverything we talk about,\n\n104\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.920\nthe rest of the episodes,\nwill revolve around risk management.\n\n105\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.080\nThat's really what we're trying to do,\nis to get our hands around.\n\n106\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.513\nNot to necessarily minimize risk,\n\n107\n00:06:22.513 --> 00:06:26.566\nwhich is what junior level\nauditors try to accomplish, but\n\n108\n00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:31.933\nto align our risk with the organization's\nrisk tolerance and risk strategy.\n\n109\n00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.337\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n110\n00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:37.417\nI know we had mentioned in a previous\nepisode, we talked about how auditing\n\n111\n00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:40.740\nis similar, has some similarities\nto project management.\n\n112\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.196\nYou had mentioned that we'll need to make\nsure we know what the scope of our audit\n\n113\n00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:47.826\nis, reminds me like in project management\nwe have something called scoped creep.\n\n114\n00:06:47.826 --> 00:06:51.825\nAnd if we're not careful,\nour project kinda gets out of scope,\n\n115\n00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:54.595\nor same thing here in auditing?\n\n116\n00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:55.845\n>> That's correct, Mike.\n\n117\n00:06:55.845 --> 00:07:00.937\nIt's very important to manage and\nmaintain scope, in audits.\n\n118\n00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:04.735\nBecause you'll start getting into areas,\nyou could have no expertise in, or\n\n119\n00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:06.986\nthe company didn't want you investigating.\n\n120\n00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:11.612\nOne of the things I've done in the past on\na couple of audits, were, where the scope\n\n121\n00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:17.020\nwasn't clearly defined, but the company\nwanted me to come in and do it anyway.\n\n122\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.390\nWhere I started poking around and was\n\n123\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.160\nable to uncover other types of\nrisk around things like HIPAA and\n\n124\n00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.195\nI was very quickly told, that's outside\nthe scope of what we wanted you here for.\n\n125\n00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:30.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I backed off.\n\n126\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.460\nBut the scope wasn't clearly defined,\nso it wasn't clear.\n\n127\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.791\nAnd initially they did want me to\npoke around until I hit something and\n\n128\n00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.602\nthey said, no.\n\n129\n00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:39.459\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's far enough.\n\n130\n00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.280\nYeah, exactly.\n\n131\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.870\nSo all those pieces are really important\nin developing your audit report.\n\n132\n00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.610\nTo help you with that, I forgot to\nmention, reading the audit charter,\n\n133\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.390\nfor instance.\n\n134\n00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.070\nIn most companies if you're\nactively involved in IT audit.\n\n135\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.200\nYou've already seen this if\nyou're a student studying, and\n\n136\n00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.410\nyou haven't had that much experience.\n\n137\n00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.130\nYou'll run across something\ncalled the IT steering committee.\n\n138\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.660\nThe IT steering committee's\ntypically generate\n\n139\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.600\na audit charter which\nsays specifically what\n\n140\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.140\naudit activities are going to take\nplace around their information systems.\n\n141\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.530\nThat could be in banking.\n\n142\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.900\nIt could be a FFIC audit, a FDIC audit.\n\n143\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.050\nIn healthcare, could be HIPAA audit.\n\n144\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.980\nHealthcare could be a PCI audit because\nmost healthcare providers accept credit\n\n145\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.690\ncards for payments, for\nco-pays, things like that.\n\n146\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.640\nSo they're involved in PCI audits,\nas well.\n\n147\n00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:44.168\nSo getting a copy of the auditor is\nreally important before you start\n\n148\n00:08:44.168 --> 00:08:48.779\nyour actual audit so\nyou understand the reporting, structures,\n\n149\n00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:52.093\nthe mechanisms, the organizational layout.\n\n150\n00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:58.110\nBut then coming back round to the other\nend of having completed your report,\n\n151\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.846\nwhat a common mistake I see in junior\nauditors and in companies sometimes\n\n152\n00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:09.863\nwho don't have an ongoing audit program,\nfor instance in manufacturing,\n\n153\n00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:16.000\nthey may oftentimes ask you to come in\nto perform an assessment, if you will.\n\n154\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.890\nBut it's basically an audit to find\nout what kind of shape they're in\n\n155\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.000\nwith regards to,\nare they handling credit cards properly?\n\n156\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.700\nAre they handling bank account,\nwire transfers properly?\n\n157\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.600\nIf they're self-insured are they handling\nemployee health records properly.\n\n158\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.730\nThose kinds of things.\n\n159\n00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.394\nWell, they're not really required\nby law to be audited in any way.\n\n160\n00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:40.515\nOne of the things that happens\nwith junior auditors and\n\n161\n00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:46.500\nwith those kinds of facilities\nis very poor follow up.\n\n162\n00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.300\nSo finding is that 20% of\n\n163\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.940\nyour staff are not completing their\nsecurity training on an annual basis.\n\n164\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.780\nAnd that, that's one of your policies,\nthat all employees will participate in and\n\n165\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.660\npass a security training\nprogram every 12 months.\n\n166\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.860\nAnd I go in and do an audit.\n\n167\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.160\nI do a haphazard pull of records,\nand I find that 20% of your\n\n168\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.000\nemployees have not completed the training\nand no one's done any follow-up.\n\n169\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.829\nWell, that's a finding.\n\n170\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.850\nThat's something that's gonna be\nwritten up in your audit findings and\n\n171\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.480\npart of your conclusions.\n\n172\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.750\nPart of your conclusions may in fact\nrelate back and say something like\n\n173\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.320\nmaybe there's a process that's not in\nplace to ensure that that happens.\n\n174\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.781\nMaybe HR wrote a policy, but\nthere's no way of enforcing it.\n\n175\n00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:42.822\nThe're no who continually checks\nto see whether that activity\n\n176\n00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:44.890\nis actually occurring or not.\n\n177\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.590\nSo one of your recommendations may be that\nyou, not that you necessarily increase\n\n178\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.130\nsecurity training efforts,\nbut that you put a new policy\n\n179\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.490\nin place with an enforcement mechanism so\nthat their managers are now responsible.\n\n180\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.660\nIf their managers don't report that\nthey've completed it that their managers\n\n181\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.570\nget written up.\n\n182\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.670\n>> Something like that.\n\n183\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:09.750\nBut what's even as important as that\nis doing your programmatic follow-up.\n\n184\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.014\nIn most of the regulated industries,\n\n185\n00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:18.630\nthis happens because they are audited\non a routine basis any way.\n\n186\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.165\nWe were talking at the break earlier,\n\n187\n00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:26.580\nthat typical small community bank may\nbe $10 billion or less in assets.\n\n188\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.250\nUndergoes 10 to 20 audits every year.\n\n189\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.900\n>> Wow. [LAUGH] >> They don't even\nhave conference rooms anymore.\n\n190\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.195\nThey're just rooms for auditors.\n\n191\n00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:37.110\nAnd you may go into,\nI've been into small banks where\n\n192\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.880\nthere was one senior auditor,\nand nine junior auditors.\n\n193\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.260\n>> Wow.\n>> Because they use those as training\n\n194\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.960\ngrounds for the new staff.\n\n195\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.550\nAnd the bank only had 20 employees.\n\n196\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.170\n>> Wow.\n[LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.455\n>> What's the deal on that?\n\n198\n00:11:49.455 --> 00:11:53.390\nAnyway, the point I'm trying to\nmake is they're used to an ongoing\n\n199\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.980\nlifestyle of having audits, where\nmanufacturing companies, etc., are not.\n\n200\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.690\nAnd so, in those regulated\nenvironments it's much more common\n\n201\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.000\nto do the follow up because\n\n202\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.380\nthey know that if somebody doesn't they're\njust gonna get clipped at the next audit.\n\n203\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:06.950\n>> Right.\n\n204\n00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:12.230\n>> So on a finding like that,\nan inexperienced\n\n205\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:17.690\nauditor might write up and say,\nyou need to put this process in place.\n\n206\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.621\nAnd then, not have any mechanism for\nfollow-up to see that it,\n\n207\n00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.170\nin fact, is done.\n\n208\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.310\nSo one of my recommendations has nothing\nto do with the exams or the requirements\n\n209\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:32.180\nis that at the conclusion of your audit\nthat you schedule with your client\n\n210\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.970\nboth a 30, a 60, and a 90 day follow up to\nfind out, are they fixing those things.\n\n211\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.460\nNow, again, in the banking world,\nyou're required to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.270\nThe bank doesn't have a choice\nbecause the next auditor\n\n213\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.490\nis gonna come around and ask them.\n\n214\n00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.030\nWhere's your results?\n\n215\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.820\n>> Gonna be the first thing\nthey're gonna ask, right?\n\n216\n00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.370\n>> Exactly.\n\n217\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.360\nExactly, that is the first\nthing I ask for.\n\n218\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.690\nSo it's important that you do your\nfollow-up work with your clients\n\n219\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.720\nin order to ensure that they're\nmanaging risk in the way that you and\n\n220\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.860\nthey both feel fits\ntheir risk tolerance and\n\n221\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.000\ntheir risk appetite and\nmatches their business strategy.\n\n222\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.379\nSo they can get to where they wanna go.\n\n223\n00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:06.450\n>> Right.\n\n224\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.500\n>> And so, one last thing I wanted\nto say about the auto report and\n\n225\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.720\nthe auto report structure as well was that\nthere should also be a general statement\n\n226\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.950\non your IS audit methodology.\n\n227\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.120\nThat's important.\n\n228\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.450\nIt may seem like fluff,\nthat's a lot of people, but\n\n229\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.395\nit's really important that you understand\nand be able to explain what the testing\n\n230\n00:13:27.395 --> 00:13:32.307\nand the sampling techniques\n\n231\n00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:37.590\nthat you used in your audit, especially if\nyou're doing any kind of special auditing.\n\n232\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.910\nWhen I say special auditing, here,\nwe're primarily talking about what we,\n\n233\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.780\nin the industry,\nwe call IT generals control audit.\n\n234\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.960\nBut I have done audits of specific\ninformation systems, to see whether or\n\n235\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.600\nnot the transactions are complete and\naccurate, and\n\n236\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.240\nthat there's no data slippage anywhere,\none way or the other.\n\n237\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.740\nThings like that.\n\n238\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.342\nAnd that's more in accounting\nsystems than anything else.\n\n239\n00:13:59.342 --> 00:14:02.601\nBut it's important to be\nable to understand and\n\n240\n00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:06.513\ndiscuss your audit methodology\nin the report as well, so\n\n241\n00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:11.892\nthat everything is covered from intro\nto objectives, limitations in scope,\n\n242\n00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:17.353\nnot necessarily in this order, your\ngeneral statement on audit methodology,\n\n243\n00:14:17.353 --> 00:14:21.080\nthe period of the audit,\nthat's really important.\n\n244\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.810\nYour findings, any conclusions,\nand reservations.\n\n245\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:31.100\nOne thing I will point out here is that\nin financial audits you may have read or\n\n246\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.820\nyou may read opinions.\n\n247\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.430\nWe do not give opinions.\n\n248\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.865\nCPA's give opinions.\n\n249\n00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those are legally binding.\n\n250\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.460\n>> Okay.\n>> And they have reverence to\n\n251\n00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.670\nthings that have to do with publicly\ntraded companies, etc., and\n\n252\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.920\nthey're specific things that\nwe typically do not do.\n\n253\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.810\nWe do not render opinions.\n\n254\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.610\nThat's another thing that,\n\n255\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:55.250\nagain, isn't covered in the book or\nthe ISACA requirements.\n\n256\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.790\nAnd that is sort of standard,\nexcuse me not non disclosure,\n\n257\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.960\nbut standard\n>> Standard practice,\n\n258\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.690\nor-\n>> Standard statements stating\n\n259\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.330\nthe fact that this is a snapshot in time.\n\n260\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.180\nThat we can't guarantee that\nsystems haven't changed.\n\n261\n00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.410\nStuff like that to prevent you for\nbeing liable for\n\n262\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.860\nanything that you might throw on a report,\ncuz again, of any IT audit system,\n\n263\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.300\nis only a snapshot picture and\ntime of that system, or systems.\n\n264\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.320\nAnd should never be viewed\nas anything more than that.\n\n265\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.160\nSo then, last couple points in this\nsession I wanted to talk about is,\n\n266\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.150\nit's also really important,\nand this is again,\n\n267\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.220\ntough for inexperience auditors,\nand it takes a mentoring.\n\n268\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.560\nThis is why the big firms typically\ntake inexperience auditors out\n\n269\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.810\nand help train them in the field is that\n\n270\n00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.310\nthey'll let you sit through several\nmeetings, and get a feel for\n\n271\n00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.820\nwhat it's like to communicate your\naudit results to the key stake holders.\n\n272\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.258\nAnd when I say key stakeholders,\nthat's often times the CEO,\n\n273\n00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:06.447\nthe CFO, the CTO, or the CIO.\n\n274\n00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:08.940\nSo you're talking to some\nvery high level folks.\n\n275\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.930\nIt could be just an audit committee which\nis a layer between the C levels and\n\n276\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.500\nthe rest of the organization.\n\n277\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.840\nIt just kinda depends.\n\n278\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.910\nBut you have to understand your audience,\nin order to communicate the audit results\n\n279\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.730\neffectively, you have to understand that\nyou can't talk really technical stuff to\n\n280\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.260\nC levels typically, but\nyou may to an audit committee.\n\n281\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.560\nJust depends on who you're dealing with.\n\n282\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.420\nSo it's really important that you learn\nto communicate effectively to those\n\n283\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.120\ndifferent audiences your audit results.\n\n284\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.410\nAnd I think I already mentioned\nthe importance of doing follow ups to make\n\n285\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.310\nsure the audit results\nare in fact being addressed.\n\n286\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.843\nBecause if I do an audit and\nI tell you all this stuffs wrong and\n\n287\n00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:49.741\nthen nobody does follow up and\nnothing gets fixed what's the point.\n\n288\n00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:50.525\n>> Right.\n\n289\n00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really accomplishes nothing.\n\n290\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.470\nSo-\n>> Now,\n\n291\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.280\nare you responsible for scheduling this\nfollow up as the auditor, or is it them\n\n292\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.790\nthat they're supposed to call you back,\nor is it all part of the same scheduling?\n\n293\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.170\nI'm gonna schedule the audit and the\nfollow up in six months at the same time.\n\n294\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.000\n>> Yeah, good question, Mike.\n\n295\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.720\nGood question, Mike.\n\n296\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.170\nWhat do you think would happen\nif you leave it up to them?\n\n297\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.070\n>> There's gonna be no follow up.\n\n298\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.140\n>> They probably won't do it.\n\n299\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.073\nYeah.\nAnd its typically covered in the cost of\n\n300\n00:17:16.073 --> 00:17:16.666\nthe audits.\n\n301\n00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:18.392\n>> Okay.\n>> Generally speaking there's no\n\n302\n00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:19.730\nadditional cost but yeah.\n\n303\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.615\nI typically made that part,\nagain typically, I'm talking generically.\n\n304\n00:17:24.615 --> 00:17:27.030\nCuz I've done this in a lot\nof different industries.\n\n305\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.802\nTypically we have what's called an exit\ninterview where we sit down the auditor or\n\n306\n00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:34.775\nthe audit team,\nmay sit down with the executives or\n\n307\n00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:39.288\nwhoever brought us in to conduct the audit\nand we share the results with them.\n\n308\n00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:42.120\nAt that time that's when I\ntypically schedule those events.\n\n309\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.887\nI just say I wanna come back in 30 days,\nlet's get it on the calendar, 60 and\n\n310\n00:17:45.887 --> 00:17:49.373\n90 days, so that they know at the end\nof that meeting that there's gonna\n\n311\n00:17:49.373 --> 00:17:53.390\nbe more follow-up and here's what's going\nto be expected of us in that timeframe.\n\n312\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.823\n>> Very good.\n\n313\n00:17:55.823 --> 00:17:57.698\n>> And I think that covers it for\nthis session\n\n314\n00:17:57.698 --> 00:17:58.840\n>> All right Brian,\n\n315\n00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.150\ngreat information there as we continue to\nlook at our auditing information systems\n\n316\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.930\nand talked a little bit about\nthe reporting side of things.\n\n317\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.990\nAnd what we need to make sure\nwe include in those reports.\n\n318\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.780\nAnd remember, if you guys want more in\ndepth coverage on any of these topics,\n\n319\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.760\njust go pick up a copy of\nthe Sybex CISA Study Guide,\n\n320\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.670\nof which Brian is one of the authors.\n\n321\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.860\nSo we're getting it right\nfrom the horse's mouth.\n\n322\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.720\nAll right,\nI hope everybody enjoyed this one.\n\n323\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.424\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n324\n00:18:25.424

00:00:17.480\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.110\ntoday we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.300\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're actually continuing our thought\n\n6\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.320\nprocess on.\n\n7\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.980\nThis is a part three.\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.110\nWe'll be looking at our\nauditing information systems.\n\n9\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.188\nAnd here with me today is one of\nthe authors of the Cybex CISA study guide,\n\n10\n00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:36.550\nMr. Bryan O'Hara.\n\n11\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.900\nHow you doing Bryan?\n\n12\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.190\n>> Good Mike.\nThanks for having me again.\n\n13\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.880\nSo Mike,\nin this last episode of domain one,\n\n14\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.880\nI'd like to talk about\na few more key terms and\n\n15\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.360\nsome tasks that are important to\nthe auditors studying for the CISA exam.\n\n16\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.590\nIn particular, we started in the last\nepisode, or in one of our previous\n\n17\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.350\nepisodes and started talking for\nthe first time about risk management.\n\n18\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.340\nAnd how that plays into\nthe entire audit life cycle.\n\n19\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.260\nToday I would like to talk a little\nbit about a new term called\n\n20\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.230\nEnterprise Risk Management or.\n\n21\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.100\nInexperienced auditors may not have ever\nread about this or seen this term before.\n\n22\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.050\nThose who've been in the field\nawhile probably understand\n\n23\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.980\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n24\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.830\nBut Enterprise Risk Management\nis really just the idea of\n\n25\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.670\nlooking at risk as a whole across\nthe entire enterprise rather than\n\n26\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.470\nkeeping it siloed into just IT.\n\n27\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.280\nSo for instance, we might look at\nEnterprise Risk Management at a bank.\n\n28\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750\nWe might look at not just IT operations,\nbut we might look at loan operations,\n\n29\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.410\nwe might look at collections,\nwe might look at home loans, mortgages in\n\n30\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.210\nother words, not home loans but\nmortgages, investments, things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.660\nNot necessarily part of our scope and\nresponsibility but it could at times be.\n\n32\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.900\nIn addition to that, excuse me,\ntoday when we talk about IT risk,\n\n33\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.880\nwe're also talking about cloud.\n\n34\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.200\nWe can't even have a conversation\ntoday without talking about the cloud.\n\n35\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.300\nSo many of our systems are cloud-based,\nso many of our applications are cloud\n\n36\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.510\nbased today that they touch almost\nall aspects of the enterprise.\n\n37\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.030\nAgain, I'll use banking as a good example,\nbut healthcare is another one where,\n\n38\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.970\nin the healthcare environment,\nthe electronic records management,\n\n39\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.700\nor Systems, touch almost every\nsingle aspect of patient care,\n\n40\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.717\nwhether it has to do with billing,\nadmitting,\n\n41\n00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:38.060\nemergency departments or\nany kind of physician care.\n\n42\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.220\nSo that you can't just look at that one\ninformation system in a silo by itself.\n\n43\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.280\nYou have to take a look at the risk\noverall to the enterprise.\n\n44\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.230\nSo it's really important\nto do some research.\n\n45\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.450\nThere's more information in the book\nabout Enterprise Risk Management.\n\n46\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.400\nI would encourage you strongly\nto understand the term and\n\n47\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.230\nget a little better feel for it.\n\n48\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.390\n>> Very good.\n\n49\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.050\n>> Next couple of concepts I wanna\ntalk about are quality assurance or\n\n50\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.440\nquality management.\n\n51\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.400\nThey're very important,\nyou'll see them on the exam, wink, wink.\n\n52\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.690\n[LAUGH] Enterprise Risk Management,\nthe same thing.\n\n53\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.710\nThey really have to do with how\nto ensure that you conduct audits\n\n54\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.760\nthat are quality based and\nthat your quality standards are met.\n\n55\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000\nSo, there has to be some type\nof quality assurance and\n\n56\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.920\nquality management built\ninto your audit process.\n\n57\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.020\nTypically, that's designed\naround the company that's\n\n58\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.470\nmanaging the audits that you work for.\n\n59\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.150\nSo, if I was going to say a three letter\nname or a two letter name of a big\n\n60\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.590\naccounting firm that I was doing\naudits for, they generally have QA and\n\n61\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.250\nQM processes in place to make sure that\nI'm doing the kinds of things I need to be\n\n62\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.120\ndoing to ensure that the audit\nresults are quality based.\n\n63\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.390\nNext two are actually\nkind of tied together.\n\n64\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.760\nThe first one is\na Key Performance Indicator or KPI.\n\n65\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.300\nISOC is notorious for acronyms.\n\n66\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.816\nSo get used to them.\n\n67\n00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:08.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> KPI is an interesting one.\n\n68\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.280\nKey performance indicators are important\n\n69\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.820\naspects of alerts to what's\nhappening in your environment.\n\n70\n00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.180\nSo a key performance indicator might\nbe something along the lines of,\n\n71\n00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.430\ngosh I'm kind of blanking here for\na second trying to think.\n\n72\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.440\nKey Performance Indicator might\nbe in the last three quarters\n\n73\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.000\nhow many times has someone not\ncompleted their security training,\n\n74\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.330\nif that number drops before a certain\namount you've got a problem.\n\n75\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.860\nYou know you expect maybe one or two every\nquarter, maybe one or two every year but\n\n76\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.590\nif you get 30 all of a sudden,\n\n77\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.440\nyou know something's wrong,\nthat's a key performance indicator.\n\n78\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.810\nAnother one of them might be,\n\n79\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.600\nthis is a great example of a very\nlarge bank I worked with a year or so\n\n80\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.090\nago where they were seeing an unusually\nlarge increase in the number\n\n81\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.300\nof vulnerabilities discovered when they\nran their monthly scans on their network,\n\n82\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.860\nthe CISO was rather upset about that.\n\n83\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because his plan was that that number\n\n84\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.530\nshould go down every month because they\nbecame more aggressive about patching.\n\n85\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.720\nWhat they came to find out was that, and\n\n86\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.150\nonly through that Key Performance\nIndicator, was that the server team\n\n87\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.320\nhad a completely different schedule for\npatching than they did for work stations.\n\n88\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd so the servers weren't getting patched\nin the same time frame that they expected\n\n89\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.800\nwork stations to be.\n\n90\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.690\nAnd so the number of\nvulnerabilities kept going up.\n\n91\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.010\nYeah, and so that\nKey Performance Indicator vulnerabilities\n\n92\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.480\nexposed every month in our scans was\ncrucial in them finding that problem.\n\n93\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.310\n>> In other words,\n\n94\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.410\nthey might not have ever known that was\ngoing on without seeing that number go up.\n\n95\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.980\n>> That's right.\n\n96\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.180\nThat's right.\nAnd so it's really,\n\n97\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.140\nthat's why it's\na Key Performance Indicator.\n\n98\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.590\nYou wanna find the ones that will tell you\nthe most about something going wrong in\n\n99\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.410\nyour environment.\n\n100\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.850\nSo if there's a change and\nit alerts you to a serious problem,\n\n101\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.220\nthat's a Key Performance Indicator.\n\n102\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.960\nOkay.\n\n103\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.160\nThose are tied very closely to something\ncalled the business scorecard,\n\n104\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.000\nthe BSC,\nthat ISACA talks a fair amount about.\n\n105\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.082\nISACA is, again, primarily an audit\nborn out of accounting association.\n\n106\n00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:16.594\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:17.974\n>> And so they have a tendency to want to\n\n108\n00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:22.380\nscore card and analyze and\ndrive metrics on things.\n\n109\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.350\nAnd a balanced score card\nreally has to do with making\n\n110\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.420\nsure that the activities that\nyou're engaged in with regards\n\n111\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.530\nto your audit are in fact balanced with\nthe strategic plans of the enterprise.\n\n112\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.670\nThat's why we talked in one of the\nprevious episodes about understanding what\n\n113\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.050\nthe strategic plans are and\nwho your key stakeholders are etc.\n\n114\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.790\nThose two become really important.\n\n115\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.010\nAnd the key performance\nindicators help you see on that\n\n116\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.670\nbalance scorecard whether or not you're\nmeeting those requirements or not.\n\n117\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.586\nThen the last couple of things that\nI want to talk about are vendor\n\n118\n00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:03.420\nselection and controls.\n\n119\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.839\nWe haven't actually attacked\nthe concept of controls yet,\n\n120\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.660\nbut controls are the policies,\nprocedures, processes,\n\n121\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.400\netc that are put in place to control and\nmanage risk.\n\n122\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.060\nAn example would be a firewall.\n\n123\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.170\nA firewall is a control mechanism.\n\n124\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.710\nThat’s a technical control mechanism;\nthere are physical control mechanisms.\n\n125\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.440\nThere are administrative\ncontrol mechanisms.\n\n126\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.640\nAn example of an administrative control\nmechanism might be a policy that's\n\n127\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.930\nimplemented via group policy that forces\na user to change their password every 30,\n\n128\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.540\nto 60, to 90 days or whatever and\nrequires that their passwords be complex,\n\n129\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.160\nthat they can only re-use after\nthe last 24, etc, etc, etc.\n\n130\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.830\nSo those are controls,\n\n131\n00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.990\nyou need to understand what\nthose are because the controls\n\n132\n00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.450\nare primarily what you're going to\nbe testing in your audit activities.\n\n133\n00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.470\nYou're going to be testing to see whether\nor not they're effective and whether or\n\n134\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.950\nnot they're actually being followed.\n\n135\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.290\nAre your policies that say you're going\nto be implementing this kind of control\n\n136\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.190\nactually taking place?\n\n137\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.420\nIf not, then you've got findings.\n\n138\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.010\nBut you also need to take\na look at the controls\n\n139\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.300\nto be able to evaluate\ntheir effectiveness.\n\n140\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.270\nAre they good controls?\n\n141\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.200\nHere's a great one I ran, [LAUGH] I\ncouldn't believe I ran across this,\n\n142\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.650\njust a few weeks ago, in an environment\nthat I do some consulting with\n\n143\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.570\nwhere the group policy requires users\n\n144\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.095\nto not be able to reuse any\nof their last 24 passwords.\n\n145\n00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:40.120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n146\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.950\n>> However, there's no date specified on\nthe length of lifetime of the password.\n\n147\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.970\nSo the password can be less than\nan hour old and be changed again.\n\n148\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.500\nSo one of the developers who was joking\naround with me in a staff meeting one day\n\n149\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.020\ntold me that he wrote a powershell script\nthat will change his password 23 times,\n\n150\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.410\nso on the day that he\nchanges his password,\n\n151\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.820\nhe just runs a script, changes it another\n23 times, and he can reuse his password.\n\n152\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.830\nThat completely bypasses\nthe intention of the control.\n\n153\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.260\n>> Pretty much making\nthat control ineffective.\n\n154\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.870\n>> Ineffective.\n\n155\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.920\nSo all you have to do, there's one little\ncheck box in your group policy that you\n\n156\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.590\nchange, and\nthat control then becomes effective.\n\n157\n00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.430\nSo when you're looking at controls,\nyou're doing your audit work,\n\n158\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.970\nyou have to take a look at not only\nthe results of your control testing,\n\n159\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.440\nbut the effectiveness of the control.\n\n160\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.240\nAre they actually doing,\n\n161\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.170\nare they performing the spirit\nof the policy if you will.\n\n162\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.760\nThe spirit of the policy was to not\nget users to reuse their passwords.\n\n163\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.210\nIf they can get around that,\nthen the control is not effective.\n\n164\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.332\nIt's basically a bypass, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.987\nExcuse me.\n\n166\n00:09:43.987 --> 00:09:49.605\nAnd then I wanted to talk a little\nbit about vendor selection.\n\n167\n00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:51.770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or vender management as we call it.\n\n168\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.470\nCuz this again goes back.\n\n169\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.820\nWe also use a balance score\ncard in vendor management,\n\n170\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.350\nwhere we try to talk about vendor risk.\n\n171\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.610\nFor those of you who may not have\nread the news, it was a third party\n\n172\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.560\nvendor who breached Target several\nyears ago, was an HVAC vendor,\n\n173\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.150\nwho's system was able to get\ninto their inner network and\n\n174\n00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.860\none of their machines became infected and\nthereby compromised the Target systems.\n\n175\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:33.100\nSelecting vendors is more than just\nseeing if they're good at what they do.\n\n176\n00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.210\nI routinely evaluate contracts for\n\n177\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.340\nvendors who say that they do\neverything under the sun.\n\n178\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.950\nYeah, we do backups, and\nas an auditor, my mantra is proven.\n\n179\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.520\n[LAUGH] Show me the results of your audit\nthat that was tested and it in fact works\n\n180\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.650\nbecause if all you're doing is telling\nme that you do it, it's worthless.\n\n181\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.240\nIt's just paper, it means nothing to me.\n\n182\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.610\nNo matter how good you are.\n\n183\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.090\nI'm sure the vendors are great.\n\n184\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.440\nBut it's really important that when I come\nin and I do a vendor management audit,\n\n185\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.110\nthat's one of the things I'm gonna look\nat is, has anyone done the due diligence,\n\n186\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.800\nthe fiduciary due diligence for\nthe corporation or the organization,\n\n187\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.070\nto ensure that those vendors are in fact\ndoing what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n188\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.730\n>> It's something that I'm sure is tough,\nbut\n\n189\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.830\ngotten much more important\nover the last few years.\n\n190\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.890\nThe way everything is interconnected, and\n\n191\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.370\nyou're giving somebody\naccess to your network.\n\n192\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:29.170\nNow you might be secure, and done your\ndue diligence and had your audit.\n\n193\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.060\nBut what about this person that's\nnow connected to your network?\n\n194\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.610\nAnd you basically assume that risk\nwhen you bring that vendor in.\n\n195\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.960\n>> That's absolutely correct, and\n\n196\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.590\nin fact it's been codified\nunder the HIPAA regulations.\n\n197\n00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.810\nToday, anyone who does business with what\nwe call a covered entity is required by\n\n198\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.000\nlaw to sign a business\nassociate agreement and\n\n199\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.660\nin that business associate agreement you\nagree to abide by all this same rules and\n\n200\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.590\nregulations and laws that the covered\nentity is bound to abide by.\n\n201\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.700\nSo, but,\nyou have to take it one step farther.\n\n202\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.890\nWhich is anyone can sign the agreement.\n\n203\n00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.290\n>> Correct.\n>> You still need to do your due\n\n204\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.840\ndiligence to audit them,\n\n205\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.200\nto be able to insure that they're in fact\ndoing what they said they were doing.\n\n206\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.690\nSo, if they say that they do backups\nnightly and they store them off site.\n\n207\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.690\nOkay, show me the proof of that.\n\n208\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.880\nOne of the more dangerous\naspects of working with vendors,\n\n209\n00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.560\nespecially cloud based vendors,\nis that I have run across\n\n210\n00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.180\nis asking them, well, what happens if\none of your other customers is breached.\n\n211\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.440\nDo you have a policy to tell me that?\n\n212\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.250\nBecause even though it may not\nhave impacted me directly,\n\n213\n00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.730\nit certainly impacted me indirectly and\nI believe I have a right to know that.\n\n214\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.980\nThe other part of vendor\nmanagement that we audit,\n\n215\n00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.180\noftentimes are what are called SLAs,\nor service level agreements.\n\n216\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.500\nTypically in the IT world,\nwhen you hear people talk about SLAs,\n\n217\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.140\nthey're talking about 99.99 uptime for\nservers.\n\n218\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.990\nWhat we're talking about is if I go\ninto a bank and I'm doing an audit, and\n\n219\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.690\npart of the audit is vendor management,\nthat's part of the scope, and\n\n220\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.230\nthe objectives of the audit is I\nwill look at all the contracts for\n\n221\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.005\nall the vendors,\nincluding the cleaning company.\n\n222\n00:13:12.005 --> 00:13:13.100\nOkay.\n\n223\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.170\nCleaning companies have physical\ndirect access to the bank after hours.\n\n224\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.910\n>> Absolutely.\n\n225\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.476\n>> I have stumbled upon them doing\nlots of things they shouldn't be\n\n226\n00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:23.400\ndoing in my history of doing this.\n\n227\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.970\nSo, I look at those and I'll say, for\n\n228\n00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.960\ninstance, it says here you do background\nchecks on all your employees.\n\n229\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.780\nPull five records in the last\n12 months and show me.\n\n230\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.400\nGive me proof of that.\n\n231\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.270\nNow, it gets a little more complicated\nwhen you get into a really large\n\n232\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.720\norganization, like a very large national\nbank, or a very large hospital.\n\n233\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.290\nThey may have thousands of vendors.\n\n234\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:52.590\nAnd you can't always provide that level\nof scrutiny for that many vendors.\n\n235\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.440\nSo we go back, we fall back onto our\nrisk management model and we risk rank\n\n236\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.380\nthose vendors and we provide the most\nscrutiny to the highest risk of vendors.\n\n237\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:08.040\nSo for instance, there may be\nan office supply place that we\n\n238\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.289\nbuy all of our toner and paper from, they\ncan't get into the building after hours,\n\n239\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.510\nwe're never out of toner or paper for\nvery long, so what is the problem?\n\n240\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.020\nThey don't have access to anything.\n\n241\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.570\n>> Right.\n>> Very low risk vender.\n\n242\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.120\nAgain, cleaning staff,\nvery high risk of vendor.\n\n243\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.020\nYou may not think about it,\n\n244\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.700\nbut with physical access to the facilities\nthey can do a lot of damage.\n\n245\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.960\n>> Yeah.\n>> They can see things people forget and\n\n246\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.650\nleave out on their desks.\n\n247\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.210\nIn bank audits one of the things that we\noften times do is what's called a clean\n\n248\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.160\ndesk policy audit where we literally\nwalk around after the bank is closed\n\n249\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.710\nwhile no one knows we're coming.\n\n250\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.290\nWe go in with a security officer and\nwe go around and we look on desks to see\n\n251\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.620\nwhat kind of confidential information\nmay have been left out on a desktop.\n\n252\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.800\nThat could expose a customer or\nexpose a bank to some risk or liability.\n\n253\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.730\n>> Interesting.\n\n254\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.030\n>> So\nevaluating those SLA's is very important.\n\n255\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.090\nThe last component of that is\nalso ensuring that the customers\n\n256\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.120\ngetting what they pay for.\n\n257\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.010\nAnother example is, this happens all\nthe time in very large organizations,\n\n258\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.320\nI worked in a health core organization\na couple years ago where they were paying\n\n259\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.680\nin the millions for connectivity\nto all their regional hospitals.\n\n260\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.450\nAnd they had a specialist come in and\ndo an audit, who does nothing but that.\n\n261\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.610\nThey work with telecommunications company.\n\n262\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.620\nSave them a half billion\ndollars in the first year.\n\n263\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.520\n>> Really?\n>> Because they had\n\n264\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.710\ncircuits they were paying for\n\n265\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.130\nthat had never been turned on because they\ndidn't have the staff to follow up on it.\n\n266\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.260\nSo they brought this young lady in,\nshe did an audit of all their circuits and\n\n267\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.940\nsaved them a half million\ndollars the first year,\n\n268\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.020\nright out the gate, just by identifying\ncircuits that they weren't even using.\n\n269\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.220\nDidn't even know that they had them.\n\n270\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.940\nSo, evaluating those service level\nagreements is really important in terms of\n\n271\n00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.800\ndriving value for your audit and\nhelping your customer also manage risk.\n\n272\n00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.850\nBecause having those circuits, for\nexample, was a risk to the organization\n\n273\n00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.510\ncuz maybe they were plugged into routers,\nmaybe they weren't.\n\n274\n00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.910\nMaybe people could burrow into your\nnetwork if they got into them.\n\n275\n00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.690\nIf you don't have visibility into it,\nit's a risk.\n\n276\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.430\n>> Absolutely.\n\n277\n00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.850\nThey're sitting there unmonitored, unused.\n\n278\n00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.220\nHuge risk.\n\n279\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.770\n>> Yeah.\nPlain and simple.\n\n280\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.850\nPlain and simple.\n\n281\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.670\nSo, last couple things I wanna touch on\nare, I think we have a few minutes left,\n\n282\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.040\nis to talk a little bit\nabout project management.\n\n283\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.670\nWe talked about that in one\nof the previous episodes.\n\n284\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.090\nMaking sure that you understand your\nproject management practices, and\n\n285\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.896\nhow you're applying them to projects.\n\n286\n00:16:30.896 --> 00:16:35.150\nAnd then I wanna talk a little bit\nabout enterprise architecture,\n\n287\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.400\njust for a second.\n\n288\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.210\nWe talked about enterprise risk\nmanagement, I mentioned a little bit of\n\n289\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:45.180\nit, but in enterprise architecture, what\nwe're talking about are concepts like LAN,\n\n290\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.630\nWAN, MAN, which doesn't get used\nmuch anymore, local area network,\n\n291\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:56.450\nwide area network, metro area network but\ntoday also, cloud, virtualization.\n\n292\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.090\nThat enterprise architecture is very\nimportant because what you'll find is\n\n293\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:07.310\nthe information systems that you're\nauditing can span the globe.\n\n294\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.950\nYou literally could have an Office 365\nenterprise with data residing in Ireland.\n\n295\n00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.980\nIt could be residing in Mexico,\ndo you even know?\n\n296\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.460\nCan you find out if you need to?\n\n297\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.510\nAgain another large national\nbank I worked with in the past\n\n298\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.430\nactually required Microsoft,\nwhen they moved to Office 365,\n\n299\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.980\nto host their data within the boundaries\nwithin the physical boundaries of\n\n300\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.620\nthe United States because they're\nrequired to by FDIC regs.\n\n301\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.450\nMicrosoft was able to do that.\n\n302\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.290\nBut for most companies,\n\n303\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.730\nyou don't have the clout to do that,\nyou're not buying 18 thousand licenses.\n\n304\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.430\n>> Right.\n>> So you don't have the clout, so\n\n305\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.860\nyour data could be anywhere in the world.\n\n306\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:47.080\nOne of the classic bank audit questions\ntoday is do you know where your data is?\n\n307\n00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.510\nAnd if you can't answer that question\n\n308\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.980\nunequivocally you're gonna be on\nthe hot seat for a couple of days.\n\n309\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.977\nYeah you're gonna really get grilled,\nit's extremely important And\n\n310\n00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:01.000\nI think that's probably it for today.\n\n311\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.150\nAnd I think that's probably it for\nthe day.\n\n312\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.660\nI think that should\nwrap up our domain one.\n\n313\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.726\nAgain as Mike said there's more\ninformation in the CISA study guide fourth\n\n314\n00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:08.317\nedition.\n\n315\n00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:13.252\nThere's plenty of stuff on\nthe ISACA website, www.isaca.org.\n\n316\n00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:16.130\nAnd I think that's probably a wrap.\n\n317\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.000\n>> Very good Mark.\n\n318\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.630\nWell heck I think you did a good\njob wrapping it up yourself there.\n\n319\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:25.280\nAs he said, make sure you guys check\nout the CISA study guide a book\n\n320\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.955\nwritten by one of the authors sitting\nright here next to me, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n321\n00:18:27.955 --> 00:18:30.495\nAnd that is the fourth edition, so\nmake sure you get that latest one.\n\n322\n00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:34.495\nSo, you get the most current information\nto make sure you pass that exam.\n\n323\n00:18:34.495 --> 00:18:36.425\nWe do thank you for\nall of that information.\n\n324\n00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:37.625\nBrian, fantastic stuff.\n\n325\n00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.785\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n326\n00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.715\nSigning off for\nITPro.TV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n327\n00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:43.795\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n328\n00:18:43.795 --> 00:18:46.434\n>> And, we'll see you next time.\n\n329\n00:18:46.434 --> 00:18:53.849\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.811\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:20.439\nAnd today, we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.270\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be getting into domain two,\n\n6\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.819\nwhich is gonna deal with governance and\nmanagement in the IT framework.\n\n7\n00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.893\nAnd here with me today\nis one of the authors\n\n8\n00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:38.674\nof the Cibex CISA study guide,\nfourth edition.\n\n9\n00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:39.794\nMr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n10\n00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:41.112\nHow are you doing, Brian?\n\n11\n00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:41.892\n>> Good morning, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:43.952\nThanks for having me again.\n\n13\n00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:47.199\nThis morning, I'd like to start\ntalking about domain two.\n\n14\n00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.319\nI wanna dive in to governance and\nmanagement of IT.\n\n15\n00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:56.348\nDomain two is only allocated 16% of\nthe resources for the CISA exam,\n\n16\n00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:01.489\nbut I believe it's one of\nthe most underrepresented areas.\n\n17\n00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.314\nMostly because once your audit\nactivities have taken place,\n\n18\n00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:17.299\nthe output of those audits is\ngovernance and management of IT.\n\n19\n00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.621\nThat's the whole purpose of going\nthrough the audit exercises to provide\n\n20\n00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.749\ninformation, as input for\nthe governance and management purposes.\n\n21\n00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.515\nSo, I wanted to start off talking just\nlittle bit about those concepts or\n\n22\n00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.270\nconstructs.\n\n23\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.665\nWhat is governance?\n\n24\n00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:36.046\nAnd how is it structured?\n\n25\n00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:37.825\nHow does it actually\noccur inside a company?\n\n26\n00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:40.846\nCuz it can take on a whole\nlots of different forms.\n\n27\n00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:46.802\n[COUGH] Basically, governance of IT\nreally just means putting structures and\n\n28\n00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:50.569\nmechanisms in place like\nsteering committees.\n\n29\n00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.850\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about those in a few minutes\n\n30\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.523\nto be able to better manage\nthe results of audit work and\n\n31\n00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:05.211\ndrive the organization\ntowards its strategic goals.\n\n32\n00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:11.491\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more\nlater about the IT strategic plan,\n\n33\n00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.812\nIT architecture and\nthe differences between strategic and\n\n34\n00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:20.019\ntactical management objectives.\n\n35\n00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.725\nSo again, I wanna go back to talking just\na little bit about what governance is\n\n36\n00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:24.649\nreally all about.\n\n37\n00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.135\nGovernance is providing\nthe oversight necessary for,\n\n38\n00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:34.489\nespecially larger organizations\nto manage a lot of moving parts.\n\n39\n00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.889\nOne of the terms you hear us talk about\nmore frequently is a steering committee.\n\n40\n00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.099\n>> What exactly is a steering committee.\n\n41\n00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.459\nIt sounds like maybe\nthey're driving things.\n\n42\n00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.103\n[LAUGH]\n>> You made a joke earlier: does it\n\n43\n00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:49.899\ninvolve cattle?\n\n44\n00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.972\nNo.\nA steering committee is really a group of\n\n45\n00:02:53.972 --> 00:03:00.109\nstakeholders, sometimes at the low\nto mid-level of management.\n\n46\n00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.730\nIn larger organizations,\n\n47\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.399\nit's often composed of higher\nlevel executive management.\n\n48\n00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.939\nIt's designed to do exactly that.\n\n49\n00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.928\nSteer IT in the direction that will\nhelp them meet their strategic and\n\n50\n00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:16.160\ntactical goals, and objectives.\n\n51\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.421\nThose goals and\nobjectives typically will be in line with\n\n52\n00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:23.538\nthe company's overall strategic plan.\n\n53\n00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:29.386\nOftentimes, when I see in doing audits\n[COUGH] and going into IT organizations.\n\n54\n00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:34.181\nWhen I see things run afoul,\nit's generally because the IT organization\n\n55\n00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:39.051\nhas gotten sidetracked with doing what\nthey think is the best IT solution or\n\n56\n00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:43.924\nthe best security solution without\ntrying to understand what the business\n\n57\n00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:47.428\nstrategy is and\nwhat they're trying to accomplish.\n\n58\n00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:52.260\nA simpler way of describing it might be.\n\n59\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.338\nWhat does it mean to move\nthe football down the field?\n\n60\n00:03:57.338 --> 00:04:01.463\nWhat are the things that you are doing\nthat will help accomplish the strategic\n\n61\n00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:02.998\ngoals of the organization?\n\n62\n00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:07.288\nOne of the things, as a side note\nabout this [COUGH] that a lot of less\n\n63\n00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:11.190\nexperienced auditors don't\nunderstand when they go in and\n\n64\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.934\nthey ask for, can I see a copy\nof your business strategy,\n\n65\n00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:20.290\net cetera is trying to understand\nexecutive compensation, for instance.\n\n66\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.088\nExecutive compensation is oftentimes tied\ndirectly to the company's strategic goals.\n\n67\n00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:29.993\nSo that if those strategic goals are met,\nthe executives are compensated for\n\n68\n00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:31.438\nmeeting those goals.\n\n69\n00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.823\nSo it's really important to understand\nthat, because that's how you get buy-in\n\n70\n00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:37.838\nfrom them when you have an initiative\nthat you think is really important.\n\n71\n00:04:37.838 --> 00:04:42.172\nAnd if it fits with those long-term\nstrategic goals, you're more likely to get\n\n72\n00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:46.138\nbuy-in by senior management,\nbecause it's going to help them as well.\n\n73\n00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:46.978\n>> That makes sense.\n>> Yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:50.101\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So and then I haven't mentioned yet\n\n75\n00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.597\ntalking a little about\nthe difference between strategic and\n\n76\n00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:59.090\ntactical, because we're going\nto see this come up again and\n\n77\n00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.578\nagain when we're talking later on\nabout organizational structure etc.\n\n78\n00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:09.688\nTypically, when you're talking strategic\nplans, you're talking high-level.\n\n79\n00:05:09.688 --> 00:05:13.318\nYou're talking long range,\nthree to five years.\n\n80\n00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.218\nTactical is more short-term.\n\n81\n00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:15.878\n>> Okay.\n\n82\n00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:16.958\n>> One year.\n\n83\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.178\nOne to three years.\n\n84\n00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:22.039\nAnd so\nwhen you're talking strategic planning,\n\n85\n00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.568\nyou're generally talking about C levels.\n\n86\n00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:27.268\nThey're the ones who set the tone for\nyour organization.\n\n87\n00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:31.288\nTypically not always, but typically they\nwill set the tone for the organization.\n\n88\n00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:34.268\nThey'll setup the strategy for\nthe company.\n\n89\n00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:39.961\nThe IT strategy and\nall the activities around audit and\n\n90\n00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:44.178\nIT development and acquisition, etc.\n\n91\n00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:48.671\nShould flow right up into\nthat larger global company\n\n92\n00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.378\nstrategy in order to meet\nthe company's objectives.\n\n93\n00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:57.746\nSo one of the first things that I do\nwhen I land on autojob is I ask for\n\n94\n00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:01.559\na copy of the business's\nstrategic plan and I also ask for\n\n95\n00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.708\na copy of the IT strategic plan\nto see if A, they even have one.\n\n96\n00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:08.628\nAnd me, if they do,\nare they in line with each other?\n\n97\n00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:14.808\nAre they fighting each other, are those\nplans completely disconnected, etc.\n\n98\n00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:20.001\nLet me give you a picture,\nlet me show you a picture\n\n99\n00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:25.948\nof the typically the folks\ninvolved at the higher level.\n\n100\n00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:27.768\nCan you see that okay or\ndo I need to scroll in?\n\n101\n00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:30.426\n>> Zoom in just a little, my old eyes.\n\n102\n00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:31.166\n>> That a little bit better?\n\n103\n00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.931\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see there that the staring\n\n104\n00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:38.014\ncommittee is at the top level along\nwith the CEO, the Project sponsor,\n\n105\n00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.118\nthe CFO and the CO.\n\n106\n00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:43.901\nTypically, this is the level where\nyour strategic planning is occurring,\n\n107\n00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:49.350\nbecause it needs to have the folks who\nhave the vision and the direct ties.\n\n108\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.440\nFor instance,\nif it's a publicly traded company,\n\n109\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.220\nto shareholders, et cetera in terms\nof what they've been tasked to do.\n\n110\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.828\nSo, this is the strategic level\nwe're talking about here.\n\n111\n00:06:58.828 --> 00:07:00.968\nLet me move on now.\n\n112\n00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:04.028\nWe can close that out.\n\n113\n00:07:04.028 --> 00:07:06.888\nGive me just one second here.\n\n114\n00:07:06.888 --> 00:07:11.389\n>> [LAUGH] And that kinda falls in line\nwith some of the stuff we've talked about\n\n115\n00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.390\nlike in project management, for\nexample, where we see that it's\n\n116\n00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.908\nthe higher ups as you said, the C\nlevels that have that long-term vision.\n\n117\n00:07:19.908 --> 00:07:24.398\nThey know where the company's going where\nit wants to be in five years, ten years.\n\n118\n00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:27.798\nIT down in the trenches,\nwe're dealing with the day to day stuff.\n\n119\n00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:29.996\nOur goals are more about\nthe end of the week,\n\n120\n00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:33.748\ntomorrow that kind of thing month to\nmonth and really getting the job done.\n\n121\n00:07:33.748 --> 00:07:38.718\nBut if those goals aren't in line with the\noverall strategy that the C-level people\n\n122\n00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:43.276\nwanna see the company in In five years,\nthen we're never going to get there.\n\n123\n00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.376\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n124\n00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:51.588\nI got one other diagram I wanna bring\nup here really quick and show you.\n\n125\n00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:52.671\nCan you see that okay?\n\n126\n00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.796\n>> Can you zoom in just a hair and\nwe can scroll up and down maybe.\n\n127\n00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:57.570\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n128\n00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.856\n>> There we go I like that.\n\n129\n00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.360\nDoesn't seem to want to scroll for\nsome reason.\n\n130\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.241\n>> Of course, eh computers,\nthey never play along nicely.\n\n131\n00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:04.867\n>> All right.\n\n132\n00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:08.314\n[LAUGH]\n>> So anyway, basically this is just a,\n\n133\n00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:09.847\nsort of an outline.\n\n134\n00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:14.250\nThis graph, by the way, is in the book\nin chapter six I believe it is,\n\n135\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.050\nit's called, titled,\nThe Steering Committee Process.\n\n136\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.338\nAnd it gives you kind of\nan idea of the tactical or\n\n137\n00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:27.369\ndaily functional activities that\nhappen inside a steering committee.\n\n138\n00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:30.968\nAnd we talk about things in here\nlike business continuity planning,\n\n139\n00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.451\nbusiness process re-engineering strategy,\n\n140\n00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:37.547\nand steering committee member review\nanalysis, board of directors review,\n\n141\n00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:41.658\nexecutive review, stuff like that, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and pull out that.\n\n142\n00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:42.193\n>> All right.\n\n143\n00:08:42.193 --> 00:08:42.889\n>> Thanks.\n\n144\n00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.574\nSo I guess what I'm trying to convey is\n\n145\n00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:52.080\nthat governance is\na company-wide activity.\n\n146\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.190\nIt typically involves senior level\nmanagement all the way down to\n\n147\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.019\nfield staff.\n\n148\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.810\nThe more tactical operations typically\noccur from the director level down.\n\n149\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.300\nAnd ISACA does have kind of a habit\nin their exam prep material and\n\n150\n00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.750\nin the exam of thinking only\nof very large organizations.\n\n151\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.938\nKeep in mind that ISACA is\nan international organization with over\n\n152\n00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:21.590\n118,000 members worldwide.\n\n153\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:29.120\nSo the work that goes into\nthe domain preparation materials for\n\n154\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.360\nthe CSA exam is built and\n\n155\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.640\ncomes off of the work of that\ninternational organization.\n\n156\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.320\nSo they typically are looking at and\ndescribing very large organizations.\n\n157\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.608\nIf you go into, excuse me,\nif you go into, for instance,\n\n158\n00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:51.200\neven a medium-size bank\nof 10 billion in assets,\n\n159\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.420\nthat's not a bank that\nmight run four states.\n\n160\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.890\nThat's a large community bank.\n\n161\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.040\nTypically, their steering committee\ndoes not always include senior\n\n162\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.810\nlevel management.\n\n163\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.550\nIt may include an information security\nmanager, because those people,\n\n164\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.900\nthere's fewer layers between senior\nmanagement and the field staff.\n\n165\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.020\n>> Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n166\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.670\nYour small organizations,\nyou've got people wearing many hats, so-\n\n167\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.630\n>> That's correct.\n\n168\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.100\n>> Those upper level and\nlower level, are the same people.\n\n169\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.610\nSo they know what's going on.\n\n170\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.570\nBut as we grow, and\nas we get the separation between those,\n\n171\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.990\nthat's when it's extremely important\nto make sure we have these plans, so\n\n172\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.930\nwe can all stay on the same page.\n\n173\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.193\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n174\n00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:37.590\nIn fact, in smaller health care\norganizations, often times,\n\n175\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.940\nthe privacy officer and\nthe security officer are the same person,\n\n176\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.880\nthey may not even share\na different [INAUDIBLE].\n\n177\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.970\nSame thing with medium sized banks,\n\n178\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.940\nthe IT Director may also be the\ninformation security officer for the bank.\n\n179\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.480\nSo you're right,\nthey tend to wear many different hats.\n\n180\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.180\nSo I can't emphasize enough,\nstudying up about the differences between\n\n181\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.120\nstrategic and tactical, and the\ndifferences between a strategic plan and\n\n182\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.800\na tactical plan,\nyou'll need to know the timeframes,\n\n183\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.590\nstrategic plans being three to five years,\ntactical being one to three.\n\n184\n00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.960\nThose are things that\nare going to be on the exam,\n\n185\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.000\nyou're gonna be expected to know that.\n\n186\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.760\n>> What are you gonna do,\n\n187\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.880\nknock on the board like\nthe teacher used to do at school?\n\n188\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.340\nThis is important, write this down, right?\n\n189\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.940\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n190\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.546\n>> Make sure you-\n>> Wink, wink, wink.\n\n191\n00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:32.190\nThat's what I would say, wink, wink.\n\n192\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.010\nSo the steering community\ncan actually look\n\n193\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.240\nvery different depending on\nthe organization that you are working in.\n\n194\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.390\nIt can be as simple as three or\nfour people in mid tier management\n\n195\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.830\nwho report to the CEO, or it could be\nthe CEO, CFO, CIO depending on whether or\n\n196\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.030\nnot you have those level of\nfolks in your organization.\n\n197\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:59.981\nI wanna talk now, just for a minute, about\n\n198\n00:12:04.485 --> 00:12:07.320\nSarbanes-Oxley.\n\n199\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.900\nI wanna take a little\nbit of a shift here and\n\n200\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.775\ntalk about how governance\nplays into all that.\n\n201\n00:12:11.775 --> 00:12:14.010\nSarbanes-Oxley, or SOX,\n\n202\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.830\nas it's typically called, came out of\nthe Enron scandal back in the early 2000s.\n\n203\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.280\nActually, it was in 2000, prior to 9/11.\n\n204\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.990\nThere was a huge fraud that was\nperpetrated by the company.\n\n205\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.020\nAnd as a result to that,\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed,\n\n206\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:41.090\nwhich now requires all publicly traded\norganizations to establish these processes\n\n207\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.530\nthat I'm talking about, governance,\nsteering committees, all of that stuff.\n\n208\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.770\nThose are all required now by law,\nby any company that is publicly traded.\n\n209\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.050\nLots of folks tend to think\nthat publicly traded companies\n\n210\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.440\nare a great big giant corporation.\n\n211\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.450\nThat's not always the case.\n\n212\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.120\nI worked with a bank, two years ago,\nthat was simply one location,\n\n213\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.960\nthat didn't even have a branch,\npublicly traded company.\n\n214\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.400\nWe typically call them penny stocks,\netc., but those companies,\n\n215\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.270\nonce they make the decision that\nthey wanna be publicly traded, and\n\n216\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:19.330\nthey put shares up for sale,\nthey fall under the Sarbanes-Oxley act,\n\n217\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.000\nand are therefore required\nto have these structures in\n\n218\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.130\nplace in order to provide governance and\noversight for their operations,\n\n219\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.530\njust to prevent, hopefully, another\nincident like Enron from happening again.\n\n220\n00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.640\nThat hasn't happened to\ndate that we know of.\n\n221\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.552\nThere have been other financial crisis\nthat we're all very familiar with.\n\n222\n00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:43.690\nBut that key one has not\nhappened since that time.\n\n223\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.520\nSo I wanna talk about, that's just one of\nthe sort of incidents over the last 20 or\n\n224\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.740\n30 years that has really\nbegun to drive this.\n\n225\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.340\nIn addition to that,\nmore recently, there have been,\n\n226\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.590\nI believe it was the Target\nbreach that you may or\n\n227\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.990\nmay not have read about a year or\ntwo ago, where\n\n228\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.250\nliability now has been\nheld to the board level.\n\n229\n00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:17.150\nTo the point that share holders\non the target corporation have,\n\n230\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.480\nI don't know that they've been successful,\nbut several of them have filed\n\n231\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.310\nclass action share holder suits\nagainst the corporation for not\n\n232\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.840\nfollowing due diligence in governance and\noversight to have prevented that attack.\n\n233\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.180\nSo now, it's no longer a case of,\nwell, I'm just the CEO.\n\n234\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.140\nI'm protected because it's a corporation.\n\n235\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.330\nYou can see the corp,\nbut you can't see me.\n\n236\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.500\nThat's not the case anymore.\n\n237\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.325\nThey're actually able to go after board\nmembers and officers of a corporation.\n\n238\n00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:50.090\nAnd so,\nwhat you're seeing today is much more\n\n239\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.490\nemphasis on direct board involvement\nin the governance process.\n\n240\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.280\nI see it much more in banking than\nanywhere else because they're so\n\n241\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.450\nclosely tied to the financial\nsystem infrastructure\n\n242\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.980\nthat the government keeps\nextremely close tabs on them.\n\n243\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.133\nFor instance, go ahead [CROSSTALK].\n\n244\n00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.247\n>> Yeah, I was thinking a good\nthing in the end though,\n\n245\n00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:11.750\nhaving a little more\naccountability at that C level.\n\n246\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.927\n>> It is, it is actually, and\nit's actually begun to drive change,\n\n247\n00:15:14.927 --> 00:15:17.962\nif I can give you a couple more,\nsort of war stories [CROSSTALK].\n\n248\n00:15:17.962 --> 00:15:18.682\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n249\n00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:24.452\n>> I had a vice president of a bank\na couple of years ago, I won't say where,\n\n250\n00:15:24.452 --> 00:15:30.227\nwho sort of came unglued at some of my\naudit results that had to do with some\n\n251\n00:15:30.227 --> 00:15:36.550\nvery serious security problems that I\nfelt needed to be addressed in the bank.\n\n252\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.290\nOne of them had to do with,\nit's kind of an off subject, but\n\n253\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.690\nit had to do with user access control,\nthe little sign on Windows 7 and\n\n254\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.230\n10 that beeps up when you go to try\nto install a piece of software.\n\n255\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.393\nHe didn't like it so\nhe told the IT department to turn it off.\n\n256\n00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:53.273\nAnd he's the CEO, so you do what the CEO-\n>> They turned it off, right?\n\n257\n00:15:53.273 --> 00:15:54.758\n>> They turned it off on their base image,\n\n258\n00:15:54.758 --> 00:15:57.058\nwhich means that every machine\nin the bank had it turned off.\n\n259\n00:15:57.058 --> 00:15:57.696\n>> Wow.\n\n260\n00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:00.739\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nwhich is a huge security problem.\n\n261\n00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:04.730\nIt's going around your controls.\n\n262\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.480\nAnd he didn't like hearing that and\nI said, well you may not like hearing it.\n\n263\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.800\nBut when the FDIC comes in and\n\n264\n00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.530\nsees it, you're going to get\ncalled on the carpet about it.\n\n265\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.020\nAnd sure enough,\nhe got called on the carpet about it.\n\n266\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.970\n>> Wow.\n>> But I was just an external vendor and,\n\n267\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.479\nbut I mean, he really kind of\ncame unglued at me about it.\n\n268\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.450\nAnd so today, when you work in that bank,\nthe UAC's turned off.\n\n269\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.870\n>> You still see it, yeah.\n\n270\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.470\nOr you see it now.\n\n271\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.200\n>> No, it's turned on now.\n\n272\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.460\nThe UAC's turned on now.\n\n273\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.770\nYeah, they fixed that.\n\n274\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:38.100\nAnd the reason, again, is because the\nfederal government, the FDIC and FFIC and\n\n275\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.980\nthe regulatory agencies in\nbanking are enforcing that now.\n\n276\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.740\n>> Mm.\n>> That the board must be aware,\n\n277\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.405\nthey must be involved in\nthe Steering Committee process.\n\n278\n00:16:47.405 --> 00:16:48.140\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n279\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.140\n>> They must be involved in completing\ntheir fiduciary responsibilities to\n\n280\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.400\ntheir shareholders.\n\n281\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.200\n>> To ensure that those adequate\ntypes of controls are in place.\n\n282\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.140\n>> So no more hiding behind I'm the CEO\nand I don't see the daily stuff.\n\n283\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.840\n>> Well, or, that was ITs problem.\n\n284\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.670\nIt's not ITs problem anymore, it's a\ncompany problem and it's a board problem.\n\n285\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.830\n>> Very good.\n\n286\n00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.830\n>> The good side of that is, you now have\n>> stakeholders with\n\n287\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.470\nresources at your finger tips to be able\nto get project initiatives started and\n\n288\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.490\nfunded well and get things accomplished.\n\n289\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.170\n>> Very good.\n\n290\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.650\n>> So, excuse me.\n\n291\n00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.890\nSo I just want to talk about Sarbanes\nOxley because it was a pretty big deal\n\n292\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.800\nin terms of how it changed the way\nthat we view governance and\n\n293\n00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.990\nview board involvement.\n\n294\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.730\nI can make a comment too about HIPAA.\n\n295\n00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.710\nIn the HIPAA regulations today it's very\nclear, very clearly stated in their senior\n\n296\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.390\nmanagement must be involved in\nthe risk assessment process, and\n\n297\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:50.620\nin all the governance activities that take\nplace within the healthcare organization.\n\n298\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:56.550\nNow, that culture still hasn't come\nto full fruition in healthcare.\n\n299\n00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.140\nThey tend to still be kinda dragging\ntheir feet just a little bit.\n\n300\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.270\nBanking on the other hand has been heavily\nregulated for well over 50 or 60 years.\n\n301\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.080\nSo to them it's just okay\nwhat do we gotta do now?\n\n302\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.910\n>> Another regulation that\nwe have to deal with.\n\n303\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.490\n>> What do we have to change to\nmake sure that we meet the rules?\n\n304\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.700\nAnd they're beginning to understand and\nsee it.\n\n305\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.310\nIt's actually kind of rewarding to\ngo in and do some audit work, and\n\n306\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.395\nactually have a CEO ask\nan intelligent question.\n\n307\n00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:24.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And be engaged in the process.\n\n308\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.880\nBecause in the past, they wouldn't have.\n\n309\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.580\nThey would have just come in and\nstomped their feet,\n\n310\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.290\nand said why are you charging me so\nmuch money?\n\n311\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.366\n>> And yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\n312\n00:18:31.366 --> 00:18:33.286\nAnd so.\n\n313\n00:18:33.286 --> 00:18:37.386\n>> [LAUGH] Now for this particular exam\nwe've talked about a couple of these\n\n314\n00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:40.220\ndifferent, the HIPAA, the Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n315\n00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.075\nDo we need to be familiar with the details\nof those types of regulations?\n\n316\n00:18:44.075 --> 00:18:46.395\nAnd what they entail and what they state?\n\n317\n00:18:46.395 --> 00:18:49.435\nOr is it more about just being familiar\nwith the fact that they're there and.\n\n318\n00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:51.135\n>> Yeah that's a great question, Mike.\n\n319\n00:18:51.135 --> 00:18:54.905\nNo you do not have to know the details\nof any of those for the exam.\n\n320\n00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:58.687\nYou won't be questioned on any of\ntheir their specific regulations.\n\n321\n00:18:58.687 --> 00:19:00.917\nBut you do need to be\naware of what they are.\n\n322\n00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:05.437\nThose are the ones where you may\nsee a question or two, wink wink,\n\n323\n00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:09.567\nwhere they throw a term like that at\nyou and it's clearly a wrong answer.\n\n324\n00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:11.497\nYou do not have to know\nthe details of that.\n\n325\n00:19:11.497 --> 00:19:15.627\nIn fact, one of the things we'll talk\non in a future sessions is COBIT,\n\n326\n00:19:15.627 --> 00:19:22.760\nwhich is an Isaca Policy framework that\nstands for control objectives for it.\n\n327\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.920\nBeen around for 40 or 50 years now.\n\n328\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.620\nYou will not have to know\nthe details of that either.\n\n329\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.240\n>> Okay.\n\n330\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.860\n>> But you will you will need\nto be able to spot the name and\n\n331\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.990\nunderstand what it means.\n\n332\n00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.530\nBeyond that I can't say much more though.\n\n333\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.030\n>> Okay very good.\n\n334\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.110\n>> Yeah.\nVery good.\n\n335\n00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.060\n>> So that pretty much wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n336\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.870\nI just wanted to talk about, again,\n\n337\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.990\nas I mentioned it's only 16%\nof the questions on the exam.\n\n338\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.470\nBut, to me, it's one of the most\nimportant pieces, because you know all\n\n339\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.560\nof your audit work revolves around the\nsteering committee and those activities.\n\n340\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.250\nThey're the ones who set\nup the audit charter.\n\n341\n00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.870\nWe talked about it in a previous episode.\n\n342\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.310\nThey set the audit schedule.\n\n343\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.960\nThey're the ones who\nwill be responsible for\n\n344\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.930\nthe follow up that we talked about\nin one of the previous episodes,\n\n345\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.730\nabout how important it is to,\nwhen you complete your audit,\n\n346\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.220\nto set up follow up with them for\n30, 60, and 90 days.\n\n347\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.240\nSo you can go back and actually see and\ntrack whether or not they're\n\n348\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.200\nmaking progress on addressing the findings\nthat came out in the audit and etcetera.\n\n349\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200\nSo.\n\n350\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.630\n>> All right Brian, a lot of great\ninformation there as we dive into domain\n\n351\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.600\ntwo, Governance and Management of IT.\n\n352\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.600\nAnd remember, if you guys want to get any\nmore in depth information on the topics\n\n353\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.710\nwe're discussing, go get your copy\nof the Sybex CISA Study Guide,\n\n354\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.900\nfourth edition of which Brian O'Hara is\none of the authors, so check that out.\n\n355\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.910\nAll right, hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n356\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.110\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n357\n00:20:51.110 -->

specifically, in this episode,\nwe're going to continue on in domain two,\n\n6\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.520\nwhich deals with governance and\nmanagement in IT.\n\n7\n00:00:29.520 -->

how you doing, Brian?\n\n10\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.110\n>> Good Mike, thanks for having me again.\n\n11\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.030\nMike, before we get started this morning\none of the things I wanted to mention was\n\n12\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.130\nthat I think the staff are gonna\npost it out on the website, but\n\n13\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.850\nI'd like to give everyone\nmy email address.\n\n14\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.374\nIt's just brian.ohara@ci-isocka.org.\n\n15\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.790\nThat's not an isaca.org email.\n\n16\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.100\nThat's centralindiana-isaca.org.\n\n17\n00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.130\n>> Okay.\n\n18\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.420\n>> But, I'd love to hear from any of you.\n\n19\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.810\nI won't answer test prep questions,\nbut I'd love to hear from any of you\n\n20\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.290\nabout whether or not you found the video\nseries helpful, whether you found the book\n\n21\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.960\nhelpful, any suggestions you might\nhave to make the material better.\n\n22\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.920\nAnd also what I'd really love to hear from\nyou being an old teacher is I'd really\n\n23\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.650\nlove to hear from you if\nyou pass the exam in June.\n\n24\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.460\n>> Very good.\n>> I wish you all the best of luck and\n\n25\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.230\nwanna make sure that you find this stuff\nuseful and can get through your exams.\n\n26\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.170\n>> Very good.\nSo that's brian.ohara@ci -Isocka.org.\n\n27\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.820\nThat is at the very beginning of theses\nvideos, you'll see it underneath his name,\n\n28\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.470\nand we'll make sure it's\non the site as well.\n\n29\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.780\nLet Brian know that these videos\nhelped you pass the exam.\n\n30\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450\n>> Thanks Mike, appreciate it.\n\n31\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.280\nSo this morning I'd like to talk some more\nabout governance and management of IT.\n\n32\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.140\nIn particular this morning I'd\nlike to talk a little bit about,\n\n33\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.160\nin one of the previous episodes we started\nthe discussion going about the steering\n\n34\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.570\ncommittee and the idea of governance\noverall in the organization.\n\n35\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.810\nAnd the importance of both strategic and\ntactical planning and\n\n36\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.776\nhow all those things wrap\naround the organizational,\n\n37\n00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:20.480\nthe organization's strategy.\n\n38\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.240\nIn this episode I'd like to begin talking\na little bit more down in the weeds and,\n\n39\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.620\nlike I said in the previous session,\n\n40\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420\nI think this is a domain that is a little\nbit overlooked in my opinion by Isaka.\n\n41\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.830\nIt only represents 16% of\nthe questions on the exam.\n\n42\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.600\nBut to me it's one of the more important\nfunctions as an auditor because once your\n\n43\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.620\naudit's done, if you're working inside\nan organization and you're doing internal\n\n44\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.650\nwork, your real work begins after\nthe audit, not during the audit.\n\n45\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.430\nIt's after the audit.\n\n46\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.130\nIt's going through the findings and\n\n47\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.760\ndeciding how to risk rank each of those,\nand getting stakeholder buy in,\n\n48\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.420\ngetting upper level management to read\nyour findings and take them seriously.\n\n49\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.165\nBecause they don't always like hearing\nthat their baby might not be pretty.\n\n50\n00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:08.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> But that's true.\n\n51\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.420\nYou go through the audit and\n\n52\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.920\nit's the results of the audit where\nyou get your actionable items.\n\n53\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.800\nAnd that's where now we've got\nto actually put this in place.\n\n54\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.380\n>> That's right.\n\n55\n00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.040\nThat's right, Mike.\n\n56\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.100\nSo today in this episode, I'd like to\ntalk a little bit about policies and\n\n57\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.850\nprocedures and standards first.\n\n58\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.540\nAnd then we'll talk some\nabout control frameworks.\n\n59\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.235\nAnd then we'll finally get into\nthe weeds and talk about controls.\n\n60\n00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:32.100\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n61\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.280\n>> That's all auditors tend to talk\nabout when you have lunch, or you're at\n\n62\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.110\nyour central Indiana ISACA meeting every\nmonth, we talk a lot about controls.\n\n63\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.640\nAnd there's a lot of misconceptions\nabout what controls are and\n\n64\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.550\nwhat they're designed to do, ect.,\nso we're gonna talk some about that.\n\n65\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.860\nTo start off with, though, I just wanted\nto clarify make sure you understand\n\n66\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.600\nthe differences between policies,\nprocedures, and standards.\n\n67\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.430\nNot only from a definitional perspective.\n\n68\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.861\nI mean you can read the book,\nthere's plenty of definitions in there and\n\n69\n00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:06.720\non the ISACA.org website.\n\n70\n00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.070\nBut that you sort of fundamentally\nunderstand the differences.\n\n71\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.860\nPolicies are management's way\nof addressing their concerns.\n\n72\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.860\nSo a policy is s written document,\ntypically.\n\n73\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.015\nThey can be unwritten.\n\n74\n00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.440\n[LAUGH] But those are not the best kind.\n\n75\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.080\nThey're a little harder to follow up on.\n\n76\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.820\nExcuse me.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.970\n>> But they're typically management's\n\n78\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.519\nexpression of their desires for\nhow things should be in your organization.\n\n79\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.250\nSo policy might be, so most of you have\nsigned at one point in your career,\n\n80\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.360\nan Acceptable Use Policy, that says\nhere are the rules for accessing and\n\n81\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.340\nusing our computer systems and\nour data inside this company.\n\n82\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.670\nYou have to assign that\nagreement to that policy.\n\n83\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.370\nAnd then there's actually\ngenerally another policy\n\n84\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.220\nthat says everyone must sign one of those.\n\n85\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.150\nSo there's a policy for the policy.\n\n86\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.255\nA little inside joke there.\n\n87\n00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:05.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So again, policies are those\n\n88\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.850\nexpressions of management's\ndesire of how things ought to be.\n\n89\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.750\nHandled inside your organization.\n\n90\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.800\nProcedures are typically\n\n91\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.090\nthe steps designed to explain\nhow you're going to do that.\n\n92\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.020\nHere's another good example.\n\n93\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.440\nGroup policy in active directory,\nyou don't have to understand\n\n94\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.490\nactive directory or\ngroup policy to to pass the exam.\n\n95\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.610\nI'm an old MCSE from way back in the day,\nso\n\n96\n00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.860\nI tend to talk in these\nkind of terms sometimes.\n\n97\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.175\nBut in group policy, a procedure for\nadding a new user would\n\n98\n00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:46.520\nbe step-by-step instructions on\nthe clicks, the screen clicks.\n\n99\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.020\nIn fact, in federal environments that\nare very, very, very tightly regulated and\n\n100\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.710\ncontrolled, you actually create\nwhat are called work instructions.\n\n101\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.290\nWhich are literally screen shots\nof the clicks on each step\n\n102\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.840\nthrough creating a user.\n\n103\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.700\nTo where you set their initial password.\n\n104\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.420\nTo what groups you put them into.\n\n105\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.840\nTo what privileges you give them.\n\n106\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.650\nEtcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\n107\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.100\nSo those are the procedures.\n\n108\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.540\nSo we have policies, procedures.\n\n109\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.410\nAnd the third one are standards.\n\n110\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.200\nAnd I'm going to talk about something\nthat's not a regulation in the terms of\n\n111\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.520\na law, but it's a regulation in terms\nof a contractual obligation, and\n\n112\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.150\nthat's called PCI, or\nPayment Card Industry Council standards.\n\n113\n00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.990\nThe Payment Council Industry developed\na set of standards a number of years ago\n\n114\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.150\ncalled the PCI DSS or\nData Security Standards.\n\n115\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.160\nYou can look online for\nthe PCI Council and find them.\n\n116\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.591\nThere are references to them in both\nthe book as well as on the ISACA website,\n\n117\n00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:48.489\nwww.isaca.org.\n\n118\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.020\nThe PCI standards are I think\na great reference point to get\n\n119\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.470\na clear understanding what standards are.\n\n120\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.390\nBecause they've defined them\nvery well over the years.\n\n121\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.550\nThere, and again,\nyou do not have to know this for the exam.\n\n122\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.440\nIt's just something that I'm using for\nteaching purposes.\n\n123\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.570\nThey have something we call the dirty\ndozen which are the 12 PCI standard\n\n124\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.480\nfamilies.\n\n125\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.590\nThere are a number of subcontrols and\n\n126\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.870\nstandards built into those but\nthere's basically 12 of them.\n\n127\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:26.030\nThose standards and all standards\nare designed to be met without exception.\n\n128\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.580\nSo if you have a standard that says\nyou must have a firewall in place.\n\n129\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.960\nThen you must have a firewall.\n\n130\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.780\nThat is a standard.\n\n131\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.710\nIt's not a.\n>> There's no grey there.\n\n132\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.700\n>> Yeah.\nThere's no grey there.\n\n133\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.000\nIf you don't have a policy, I mean,\n\n134\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.770\nif you don't have a firewall in place,\nyou're in violation with the standard.\n\n135\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.180\nYou do not meet the standard.\n\n136\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.200\nIn the PCI world,\nif you do not meet the standards,\n\n137\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.130\nthat could get your contract to accept\ncredit cards revoked so it's not a.\n\n138\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.478\nWe'd really like to have this policy and\n\n139\n00:07:55.478 --> 00:08:00.603\nI'll tell you another example in the world\nof banking or in healthcare, for instance.\n\n140\n00:08:00.603 --> 00:08:08.866\nWhen a FDIC auditor or state financial\ninstitution auditor comes into a bank and\n\n141\n00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:14.046\ndoes an audit there are policies and\nguidelines,\n\n142\n00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:20.828\nwhich should be adhered to, but\nif they're not findings occur,\n\n143\n00:08:20.828 --> 00:08:28.650\nnot revocation of your ability to do\nbanking unless they're really bad.\n\n144\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.240\nThere are different levels of\nseverity involved in there.\n\n145\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.150\nAnd there are banks who really fall\ndown so badly that they get shut down.\n\n146\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:42.530\nI don't know if you saw on the news\nover the last couple days, this is just\n\n147\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.480\nI don't even know how to describe this,\nit's so incredibly stupid and dangerous.\n\n148\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.450\nThere was a bank,\nI believe it was in Bangladesh,\n\n149\n00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.670\nthat was popped for about $15 million or\nsomething like that.\n\n150\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.975\nThey had actually plugged their network\nInto the internet with $10 routers.\n\n151\n00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, it's not funny.\n\n152\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.560\nIt gets really serious.\n\n153\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.440\nThey were plugged into what's called the\nSWIFT network, which is the international\n\n154\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.020\nnetwork that allows banks to move\nmoney between banks securely.\n\n155\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.740\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah,\n\n156\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:19.410\nthat's how you do wire transfers from\nhere to Europe, to South America, etc.\n\n157\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.760\nThat endangered the entire\nSwift network worldwide.\n\n158\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.490\n>> Wow.\n\n159\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.890\n>> Yeah, and all because no\none was doing any audit work.\n\n160\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:33.530\nThe countries, the regulatory system's\nnonexistent, let's just face it.\n\n161\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.820\nAnd what really surprised me was\nthat the SWIFT organization,\n\n162\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.790\nyou don't have to know any of this for\nthe exam.\n\n163\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:45.530\nThe Swift organization is the organization\nthat provides the network for banks\n\n164\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.060\nin order for you do what are called wire\ntransfers, not ACH, but wire transfers.\n\n165\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:55.057\nSo I can do a transfer from a bank\nhere in the US to a bank in\n\n166\n00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:59.433\nGermany [SOUND] just like\nthat the money is gone.\n\n167\n00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:05.925\n>> So is Swift allowed this to happen this\nbank to connect using these cheap routers?\n\n168\n00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:09.285\n>> They never bothered to look.\n\n169\n00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:13.310\nSorry I got a little sidetracked on\nthat one because a friend of mine\n\n170\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.240\nsent me a little article about it\nthis morning before the session.\n\n171\n00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.910\nAnd reminding me about it and I thought\nit'd be a great time to bring it up.\n\n172\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n173\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.230\n>> So a very clear\n\n174\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.930\nexample of what happens when there's\npoor governance and oversight in place.\n\n175\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:33.700\nThat literally could have exposed\nthe entire world wide Swift network\n\n176\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.329\nto compromise.\n\n177\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.260\nI don't know if it did or not.\n\n178\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.910\n[LAUGH] Maybe perhaps the bank in\nBangladesh was the only one that got hit.\n\n179\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.600\nBut the fact that they\nwere operating a bank and\n\n180\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.600\ndoing worldwide cash transfers or\nwire transfers behind $10 routers.\n\n181\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.110\nLiterally $10.\n\n182\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.130\nThey bought them used.\n\n183\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.940\n$10 routers, no firewalls.\n\n184\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.820\n>> That is scary.\n\n185\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.190\nThat's really scary.\n\n186\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.920\n>> It's insane in today's world.\n\n187\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.390\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Completely insane.\n\n188\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.980\n>> Now was it auditors\nthat discovered this?\n\n189\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.440\nOr how was it all brought to the light?\n\n190\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.850\n>> I know it was the Swift organization.\n\n191\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.320\n>> Okay\n>> Yeah because the bank said\n\n192\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.690\nhey we got hacked.\n\n193\n00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.190\nWe lost them.\n\n194\n00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.090\n>> Yeah, it really does underscore or\n\n195\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.200\nhighlight the importance of-\n>> Governance and\n\n196\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.160\ndoing audits and adhering to these\npolicies, procedures and standards.\n\n197\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.240\n>> Yeah, correct.\n\n198\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.240\nYeah, its, I can't emphasize enough how\nimportant proper governance and IT is.\n\n199\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.180\nAnd this is just a clear example of\nwhere everything in the chain failed.\n\n200\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.670\nEverything.\nIt just completely,\n\n201\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.970\ncould have been more\ndisastrous than it was,and\n\n202\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.002\nI don't even know how to\nbegin to say more than that.\n\n203\n00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.110\n[LAUGH] It's that bad.\n\n204\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.270\nBut, it's a clear case of there\nwere no policies and procedures or\n\n205\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.750\nstandards in place.\n\n206\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.080\nEvidently Swift,\n\n207\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.160\nI don't know what there standards\nare because I've never worked with them.\n\n208\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.730\nI don't know what their rules are for\n\n209\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.620\nallowing people to attach\nto their networks.\n\n210\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.710\nBut at the break Mike and were having\na side bar about, it's not a lot different\n\n211\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.070\nthan what we talked about on one of the\nprevious sessions with vendor management\n\n212\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.890\nwhere you're allowing that company\nto connect, that bank in this case,\n\n213\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.120\nto connect to the same network that\neveryone else is connected to.\n\n214\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.810\nYou'd think there would be\nsafeguards in place to protect\n\n215\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.200\nthe other people on that network.\n\n216\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.253\nAnd so it goes to due diligence\nof making sure [CROSSTALK].\n\n217\n00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:24.650\n>> It's a chain.\n\n218\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.640\nSwift is then accepting the risk\nof allowing them to connect.\n\n219\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.960\nBut then other people that\nare connected to Swift.\n\n220\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.570\nAre unknowingly accepting that same risk.\n\n221\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.270\n>> Well that's it.\n\n222\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.930\nThey're accepting risk.\n\n223\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.600\nThey don't have the authority to accept.\n\n224\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.880\n>> Yes.\n>> Because they're biting off risk for\n\n225\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.130\nother companies that don't know about it.\n\n226\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.570\nSo, hopefully this triggered Swift to\ndo a little more due diligence and\n\n227\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.750\nmaybe put some policies and\nprocedures in place.\n\n228\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.370\n>> Well this only came\nto light in the last,\n\n229\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.890\nI think I read about initially the day\nbefore I left or on the flight down here.\n\n230\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.010\n>> Okay.\n\n231\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.290\n>> That that had happened and\nwas again was reminded this morning.\n\n232\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.790\nSo, anyway, back to the discussion\nof governance and management of IT,\n\n233\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.360\nit just goes to show you that proper\noversight, management of the projects,\n\n234\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.490\nmaking sure that the right resources\nare assigned to the right initiatives,\n\n235\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.700\nto ensure not only the safety and\noperational capabilities of\n\n236\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.800\nthe organization but that they meet\nthe strategic demands of the organization.\n\n237\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.350\nSo, I don't think we have any\nquestions coming in online yet.\n\n238\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.880\n>> Not yet.\n\n239\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.550\n>> So I'll go on and talk a little\nbit now about control frameworks.\n\n240\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.820\nI'll say this.\n\n241\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.179\nIn the book, there are three specifically\nthat you need to know about.\n\n242\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.490\nAnd I've got a graphic I want to\nbring up to show you real quick here.\n\n243\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.574\n>> Okay.\n>> Give me just a second.\n\n244\n00:13:49.574 --> 00:13:53.731\nYeah, there it is.\n\n245\n00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:54.973\nThere we go.\n\n246\n00:13:54.973 --> 00:14:01.074\nYeah, these are organizational\norganizations\n\n247\n00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:08.514\nexcuse me these are organizations\nthat build standards and\n\n248\n00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:13.422\nprocedures but I brought it up because I\n\n249\n00:14:13.422 --> 00:14:18.200\nwanted you to see COSO in particular.\n\n250\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.210\nIt's composed of the G10 countries.\n\n251\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.190\nThere might be a question wink,\nwink on the exam about what it\n\n252\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.970\ntakes to become a member of the G10 or\n\n253\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:37.470\nCOSO and the other to that would\nprobably be something like a government.\n\n254\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wink, wink so I thought I'll bring that\n\n255\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.270\nlittle piece up and mention COSO because\nI'm gonna talk about it as well.\n\n256\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.350\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna close that down now.\n\n257\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.220\nThank you.\n\n258\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.968\n>> And COSO stands for?\n\n259\n00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:56.350\n>> You just got me off guard.\n\n260\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.130\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations.\n\n261\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.220\nIt's an international organization,\nmuch like the ISO.\n\n262\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.618\nAnd the reason I bring it up\nis a lot of the initial work\n\n263\n00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:14.904\nin Copid five which is one\nof the control frameworks.\n\n264\n00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:18.360\nCOSO developed one,\nthere's one called B-A-S-E-L.\n\n265\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.794\nAnd then Cobet which is\ncontrolled objectives for\n\n266\n00:15:21.794 --> 00:15:25.550\nIT which was developed by\nISACA back in the 80s.\n\n267\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.150\nThese were all developed out\nof international efforts.\n\n268\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.140\nAnd again remember ISACA is\na very large worldwide network.\n\n269\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.709\nThis is not a US-centric organization with\na few member countries around the world.\n\n270\n00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:41.030\nWe have a 118,000 members worldwide.\n\n271\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.180\nWe have them in Dubai,\n\n272\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.380\nwe have them in Egypt, we have them in\nSouth America, we have them in Japan.\n\n273\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.350\nIn, all over Southeast Asia.\n\n274\n00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.205\nThey are, literally, all over the world,\nand covered over Europe.\n\n275\n00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:55.342\n>> Mm-mm.\n>> Very large organizations,\n\n276\n00:15:55.342 --> 00:15:57.971\nCOSO works very closely with with ISACA.\n\n277\n00:15:57.971 --> 00:15:59.050\nThey have for years.\n\n278\n00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.951\nISACA has a seat at that\ntable as an organization.\n\n279\n00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:04.450\nI believe they're the only ones that do.\n\n280\n00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.550\nEverybody else has to\nbe a world government.\n\n281\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.350\nSo it's a big organization.\n\n282\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.750\nSo they tend to think in very big terms.\n\n283\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.930\nExcuse me, I didn't mean to click on that.\n\n284\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.979\nSo it's important that you,\nreview the control frameworks in the book.\n\n285\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.450\nBe familiar with them.\n\n286\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.360\nYou will not have to answer\nspecific questions about them.\n\n287\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.300\nSo for instance, everybody, students,\noftentimes get uptight about COBIT and\n\n288\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.620\nhaving all the inners and outers of COBIT.\n\n289\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.740\nYou do not have to do that.\n\n290\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.200\nIt is not on the exam.\n\n291\n00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.381\nBut, you need to know the names\nof the frameworks and\n\n292\n00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:41.287\nwhere they fit in the bigger\npicture of things.\n\n293\n00:16:41.287 --> 00:16:43.409\n>> So it's really important that\nwe understand what it is, but\n\n294\n00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:45.121\nwe don't have to know the details-\n>> Details\n\n295\n00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:46.306\n>> Of it, at least for the exam.\n\n296\n00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:50.900\n>> Not at all, not at all.\nSo, moving on.\n\n297\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.570\nSo we talked a little bit\nabout control frameworks.\n\n298\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.496\nThe frameworks, the COBIT.\n\n299\n00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:59.470\nThere are other control frameworks.\n\n300\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.700\nNIST has one.\n\n301\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.980\nThe National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology.\n\n302\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.400\nThere are a number of other\norganizations that have those as well.\n\n303\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.790\nBut I want to talk a little bit about\ndown in the weeds about controls and\n\n304\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.920\nwhat those are.\n\n305\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.300\nAt the top of the session we\ntalked a little bit about that.\n\n306\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.320\nControls are really\nthe means of managing risk,\n\n307\n00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.733\nthrough policy, procedures,\nguidelines, practices,\n\n308\n00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:34.814\nand organizational standards, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:39.060\nSo when we say managing risk,\nthat's why they're called controls.\n\n310\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.024\nControls are put in place to manage risk.\n\n311\n00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:47.416\nWe set a user's password\nexpiration link for 90 days,\n\n312\n00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:52.542\nbecause we know that if we change\nthose regularly, if someone were\n\n313\n00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:57.681\nto get a hold of that account be\nable to get into that user's stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:01.617\nBy changing their password every 90 days\nthat bad person would then immediately\n\n315\n00:18:01.617 --> 00:18:03.340\nlose access to the system.\n\n316\n00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.110\nSo it's a good idea to keep\nthose passwords changed so\n\n317\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.900\nthat if someone were to gain access,\nthey wouldn't keep it forever.\n\n318\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.260\nLet me think of another good example.\n\n319\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.370\nFirewalls.\n\n320\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.170\nFirewalls are a great control mechanism.\n\n321\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.400\nFirewalls, there are,\nwell I don't wanna jump ahead, for\n\n322\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.760\njust a second, we'll come back.\n\n323\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.130\nThere are basically four or\nfive types of controls.\n\n324\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.290\nAnd it's important that you know these.\n\n325\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.550\nSo, I used to tell my students,\nwrite these down.\n\n326\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.130\n>> Right.\n>> Okay, these are important.\n\n327\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.278\nThere are administrative controls,\ntechnical controls,\n\n328\n00:18:40.278 --> 00:18:47.690\nmanagement controls, legal controls,\nthose are the ones outlined in the book.\n\n329\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.418\nAnd the one that I think should have been\nadded that we just didn't have time to\n\n330\n00:18:52.418 --> 00:18:54.477\nput it in was physical controls.\n\n331\n00:18:54.477 --> 00:18:59.323\nAnd the reason I say that is there's\na spot in the HIPAA regulations which\n\n332\n00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:03.706\nis the Health Information Portability and\nAccountability Act.\n\n333\n00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:05.750\nWhich has to do with all\nof our health records.\n\n334\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.560\nThat breaks out what they call,\nthey don't call them controls,\n\n335\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.170\nthey call them safeguards.\n\n336\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.500\nIt's the same thing, tomato, tomato.\n\n337\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.960\nFor the purposes of this exam,\nit's controls.\n\n338\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.160\nWhen you're working in the world of HIPAA,\nthey're called safeguards.\n\n339\n00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.730\nAnd they break them down into\nadministrative, technical and physical.\n\n340\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:26.790\nAnd when we talk physical,\n\n341\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.750\nwe're talking about things like locks\non doors, okay, things like that.\n\n342\n00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.427\nThose are very important.\n\n343\n00:19:33.427 --> 00:19:38.797\nI believe, because the provide, generally\nthe first layer and foundation of\n\n344\n00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:44.428\nany defense system in terms of protecting\nyour information and security assets.\n\n345\n00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:48.440\nWhich we'll talk about in the very\nlast series of the videos.\n\n346\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.900\nThat's covered in the last\nchapter of the book.\n\n347\n00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.220\nSo we have controls which\nconsist of policies,\n\n348\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.620\nprocedures, guidelines, practices and\norganizational standards.\n\n349\n00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.770\nPolicies we already talked a little bit\nabout which are those written documents\n\n350\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.230\nthat tell us how we\nshould be doing things or\n\n351\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.380\nexcuse me,\nwhat the environment should look like.\n\n352\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:17.410\nProcedures are the steps involved\nin implementing those policies.\n\n353\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.800\nGuidelines are really just references.\n\n354\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.152\nSo a guideline might be, we prefer\nthat you come in between eight and\n\n355\n00:20:23.152 --> 00:20:23.980\nnine in the morning.\n\n356\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.690\nThat's a guideline.\n\n357\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.830\nIt doesn't say you must be here by nine.\n\n358\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.840\nAnd I'm very cautious when\nI'm working with folks,\n\n359\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.410\nin terms of writing or\nupdating their policies and procedures.\n\n360\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.160\nBe very careful with must and should.\n\n361\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.800\nAnd will always.\n\n362\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.056\nTerms like that, because they can get you\nin trouble, because as an auditor, and\n\n363\n00:20:43.056 --> 00:20:44.797\nagain, this isn't on the exam.\n\n364\n00:20:44.797 --> 00:20:49.384\nBut, as an auditor, one of the things that\nI will often do is look at your policy and\n\n365\n00:20:49.384 --> 00:20:52.729\nsay, you wrote in here that\nyou must do this, you're not.\n\n366\n00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:54.847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, now,\n\n367\n00:20:54.847 --> 00:20:58.600\nall you have to do is to change\nthat to shall, Or should.\n\n368\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.280\nAnd all of a sudden you're off the hook.\n\n369\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.770\nSo just some minor massaging in\nlanguage can make a big difference\n\n370\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.030\nin terms of whether you get\nan audit fining or not.\n\n371\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.750\nNow, I'm not suggesting that you change\nthose without checking with management,\n\n372\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.460\nand do they still meet your criteria,\nyour standards, etc.\n\n373\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.620\nBut it's a common error for inexperienced\nauditors who want to jump all over that.\n\n374\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.770\nYou must do this!\n\n375\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.760\nWell, not really depends on\nwhat the organization wants.\n\n376\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.910\nYou need to review that with management.\n\n377\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.610\nPractices and procedures are,\npractices would be something more like.\n\n378\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.580\nSomething you might see\nin a doctor's office.\n\n379\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.800\nMy wife's a physician and\nsome of the practices might be you\n\n380\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.080\nalways wash your hands before and\nafter you see a patient.\n\n381\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.980\nThat's a practice.\n\n382\n00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.910\nIt's not a policy, it's not a procedure.\n\n383\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.350\nYou don't need to, okay you put your hand\nunder the water and turn the faucet.\n\n384\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.580\nThat's a procedure,\n\n385\n00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.630\na practice is just something that\nshould be done on a regular basis and\n\n386\n00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.870\nif you don't there can be consequences for\nthat, but does that make sense?\n\n387\n00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.490\n>> Yes.\n>> To you, Mike,\n\n388\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.990\nin terms of what a practice is?\n\n389\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.140\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then the last part is\n\n390\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.510\nthe organizational structure.\n\n391\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.290\nAs an auditor you need to\nbe able to take a look and\n\n392\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.560\nbe learning about how organizational\nstructures are designed.\n\n393\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.320\nTo see whether or\n\n394\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.330\nnot the organizational structure in\nplace actually supports your controls.\n\n395\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.260\nSo for instance, if you have\nactive directory, wait a minute,\n\n396\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.510\nhere's a better one.\n\n397\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.578\nI just ran into this the other day.\n\n398\n00:22:32.578 --> 00:22:36.667\nYou have Firewall rules that say or\n\n399\n00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:41.884\na policy that says we\nwill block any outbound\n\n400\n00:22:41.884 --> 00:22:47.665\ntraffic that's headed to\nknown malware sites or\n\n401\n00:22:47.665 --> 00:22:50.353\nknown hacking sites.\n\n402\n00:22:50.353 --> 00:22:54.853\nAnd I get on the computer and\nI go [SOUND] then I go to unknown and\n\n403\n00:22:54.853 --> 00:22:57.376\nI'm able to go to a hacking site.\n\n404\n00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:00.830\nThe reason is because the Firewall\nadministrator doesn't\n\n405\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.650\nhave time to adequately find out whether\nor not the policies are working.\n\n406\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.030\nSo the organizational structure isn't in\nplace where there isn't enough staff,\n\n407\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.850\nthere isn't enough staff time, there are\nnot enough time slices in the day, etc.\n\n408\n00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.950\nTo actually get the work done.\n\n409\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.510\nAnd so\nto me the finding is not necessarily\n\n410\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.380\nthat I can go to hacking sites.\n\n411\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.130\nThe finding might be that your\norganizational structure doesn't support\n\n412\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.720\nthe implementation and\nmanagement of that control mechanism.\n\n413\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.330\n>> See, that's something I wouldn't\nhave thought about it that way.\n\n414\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.040\nThat's interesting.\n\n415\n00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.950\n>> Right.\nSo you have to think,\n\n416\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.100\nsometimes, at a little higher level.\n\n417\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:41.380\nAnd we'll talk in a future episode about\ndoing what we call root cause analysis.\n\n418\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.250\nAnd talking a little bit more about\nlooking at the bigger picture.\n\n419\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.939\nOne last example of that might be,\n\n420\n00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:52.009\nthat's one of the things I\ntry to teach young auditors.\n\n421\n00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:56.237\nExcuse me, inexperienced auditors,\n\n422\n00:23:56.237 --> 00:24:02.265\nis always ask the question,\nnot How do I wanna say this?\n\n423\n00:24:02.265 --> 00:24:06.328\nWhat are the other things leading\nup to this not being done?\n\n424\n00:24:06.328 --> 00:24:12.247\nWhat other extemporaneous\nforces are not supporting\n\n425\n00:24:12.247 --> 00:24:16.989\nthis control to be implemented properly?\n\n426\n00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:18.540\nYou may find a number of things.\n\n427\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.570\nAnother one, a great one,\nis change management.\n\n428\n00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.110\nChange management as in an organization\nis not working properly.\n\n429\n00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.900\nFirewall rules won't be\npromulgated properly.\n\n430\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.660\nAnd so, if you jump on\nthe firewall administrator and\n\n431\n00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.740\nsay why aren't these rules in place\nyou say they're supposed to be.\n\n432\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.070\nThe real problem is change management\nboard is inadequately handling them.\n\n433\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.680\nSo it may not always be the employee.\n\n434\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.520\nYou have to do some root cause analysis.\n\n435\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.322\n>> Really have to, yeah exactly.\n\n436\n00:24:40.322 --> 00:24:43.190\nYou said that root cause\nof what the problem is.\n\n437\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.200\n>> Right.\n\n438\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200\nSo then the last couple things\nthat have been tying up.\n\n439\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.650\nI know we're a little bit over time here.\n\n440\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.760\nSo I wanna talk some more a little\nbit about the administrative\n\n441\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.660\ntechnical management legal stuff.\n\n442\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.810\nSo administrative controls as I said,\nexcuse me.\n\n443\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.260\nControls can be administrative,\ntechnical, management, legal.\n\n444\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:06.240\nAn example of an administrative\ncontrol would be a policy.\n\n445\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.130\nA written policy that says this and\nthis and this.\n\n446\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:14.610\nAn example of a technical control might\nbe something like a group policy.\n\n447\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.590\nBecause that group policy can\nthen be applied to all users.\n\n448\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.980\nAnd it doesn't require intervention\nby a person all the time.\n\n449\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.800\nSo you're putting a technical control in\nplace that forces them to change their\n\n450\n00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.370\npasswords regularly to make them complex,\netc.\n\n451\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.950\nSo there's a technical control\nin place to enforce that.\n\n452\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:38.140\nA management one might be, for\ninstance, that management routinely\n\n453\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:45.750\nreviews pre-hire records.\n\n454\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.100\nTo ensure that employees\nhave had the adequate\n\n455\n00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.030\nscreening done before they're hired.\n\n456\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.739\nAnd legal ones might be things like\n\n457\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:59.730\nin a bank robbery situations there\nare certain things that have to be done.\n\n458\n00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.510\nIn terms of meeting legal requirements for\nthe banks.\n\n459\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.160\nAlso in breach notification situations.\n\n460\n00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.560\nWhere a healthcare organization or\nbank has had a data breach occur.\n\n461\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.580\nThere are certain legal things that\n\n462\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.070\nhave to be addressed immediately\nprior to any technical stuff etc.\n\n463\n00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.300\nRegulars have to be notified,\nattorneys have to be brought in etc.\n\n464\n00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.230\nSo.\n\n465\n00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.770\n>> Very good.\n\n466\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.510\n>> Yeah, I think that's it for\nthis session.\n\n467\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.823\nI think that's enough for\nfolks to chew on for a while.\n\n468\n00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:33.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We covered a lot of material, thanks.\n\n469\n00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:34.630\n>> But it was great,\ngreat information there.\n\n470\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.690\nGreat stories that really kinda\ntake what we're talking about and\n\n471\n00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.570\nput it in a real world scenario.\n\n472\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.950\nThat definitely helps it sink in, and\nI think explains the concept very well.\n\n473\n00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.820\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n474\n00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.630\nRemember, if you guys want more\ninformation, a little more in depth\n\n475\n00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.150\ncoverage on these topics, go out and\ngrab a copy of the Cybex CISA\n\n476\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.490\nstudy guide fourth edition, of which\nBryan O'Hara is one of the authors.\n\n477\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.730\nSo go get that, take a look at that.\n\n478\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.160\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n479\n00:27:01.160 -->

00:00:17.470\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.740\nwe're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.830\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nthis is actually a part three, so\n\n6\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.700\nwe're continuing on our look at\ngovernance and management in IT.\n\n7\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.140\nAnd with me today is one of\nthe authors of the Sybex,\n\n8\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.230\nCISA, study guide,\nfourth edition, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.900\nHow you doing, Brian?\n\n10\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.660\n>> Good, Mike, thanks.\n\n11\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910\nSo, for this session today\nwe're gonna cover three or\n\n12\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.390\nfour key points that are in the chapter,\nin the book on governance and\n\n13\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.590\nmanagement of IT as well as covered in\nsome of the study materials you can get\n\n14\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.020\nfrom the ISACA website at www.isaca.org.\n\n15\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.200\nThe first couple are, I'd like to start\noff with sort of a general conversation\n\n16\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.260\nabout regulatory requirements so\n\n17\n00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.800\nthat the folks watching at home,\nor wherever they happen to be,\n\n18\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.580\nbecome a little bit more familiar and\ncomfortable with the terms.\n\n19\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.170\nI'm sure most all of you\nhave either heard these or\n\n20\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.210\nmaybe you know already what they're about\nand have some in depth understanding.\n\n21\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.860\nBut it's important that you\nbe able to identify and\n\n22\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.740\nbe able to understand the context of\nthem in the realm of IT audit and,\n\n23\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.580\nmore importantly, why they are important.\n\n24\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.830\nBecause any organization\nthat has any type of\n\n25\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.310\nregulatory requirements is gonna probably\nfall into one of these four areas.\n\n26\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.160\n>> So Brian, these are different from our\norganization requirements that we might\n\n27\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.080\nhave in place already?\n\n28\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.640\n>> That's right.\n\n29\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.780\nThat's right.\nThe organization requirements generally\n\n30\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.330\nare things that senior\nmanagement have felt\n\n31\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.540\nare necessary in order to help the\nbusiness achieve their strategic goals.\n\n32\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.280\nThese may be some of the same, but\n\n33\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.730\nthey may also be different depending\non the nature of their business.\n\n34\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.380\nOne example might be in a health care\nsetting where the first one I'm going to\n\n35\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.380\ntalk about, PCI or the Payment Card\nIndustry Council, requirements\n\n36\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.650\nwhile they are not statutory in nature,\nthey are contractual in nature.\n\n37\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.870\nSo we still consider them\nregulatory-like requirements.\n\n38\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.340\nA health care organization, for\ninstance, may have organizational needs\n\n39\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.850\nto protect information that go above and\nbeyond PCI.\n\n40\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.840\nBut they're concerned with PCI as well,\nbecause that's how they\n\n41\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.830\naccept co-payments from patients,\nthat's how\n\n42\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.800\nthey receive payments over the phone for,\nI guess what you'd call co-payments.\n\n43\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.800\nThe rest of your deductibles for\npayment services, that kind of stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.130\nSo the first term payment card\nindustry council requirements\n\n45\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.423\nare really contractual in\nnature they are not statutory.\n\n46\n00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:56.030\nBut again it's important\nthat we talk about them,\n\n47\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.082\nbecause you can go almost nowhere today\nwhere any type of commerce occurs where\n\n48\n00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:05.260\nyou aren't going to use your credit card\nor debit card or something of that nature.\n\n49\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.670\nSo it's important that you understand\nwhat the standards are and\n\n50\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.350\nsort of a fundamental understanding of\nthe requirements, which are to protect and\n\n51\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.380\nwe will talk about in the last\nfew episodes of the series,\n\n52\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.660\nwe'll talk about protecting\ninformation assets.\n\n53\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.270\nBut it's really about protecting\n\n54\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.180\ncardholders from having their\ninformation compromised in any way.\n\n55\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.120\nSo the second group that I'd\nlike to talk about is HIPPA or\n\n56\n00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.310\nthe Health Information Privacy Portability\nand Accountability Act.\n\n57\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.190\nThe HIPPA act was\noriginally passed back in\n\n58\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.650\nthe mid 90s during\nthe Clinton Administration.\n\n59\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.215\nIn its early days was really designed\naround allowing people to be able\n\n60\n00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:52.030\nto move from job to job without\nlosing insurance coverage.\n\n61\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.220\nIt's become much more of a behemoth\ntoday with both a security and\n\n62\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.860\nprivacy rule that govern requirements\naround healthcare systems.\n\n63\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.080\nHow healthcare data is handled,\nand managed, and protected.\n\n64\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.649\nSo it is statutory in nature.\n\n65\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.420\nHIPPA is an act, that's what the last\nA in the HIPPA stands for is Act.\n\n66\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.560\nIt is a federal regulation promulgated\ndown through the Department of Health and\n\n67\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.950\nHuman Services.\n\n68\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.970\nYou don't need to know all that for the\nISACA exam, but it's just important that\n\n69\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.710\nyou have some familiarity with who the\norganization is that manages all that and\n\n70\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.190\nsome of what their regulatory\nrequirements are about.\n\n71\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.910\nOne of the interesting things I always\nfind about HIPAA is that they have,\n\n72\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.640\nwe talked in one of the previous episodes\na little bit about administrative and\n\n73\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.710\ntechnical and physical types of safeguards\nis what it's called in healthcare, or\n\n74\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.430\ncontrol mechanisms.\n\n75\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.560\nAnd in addition to that,\nthose safeguards have attributes\n\n76\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.580\nunder the HIPAA regulations that say that\nthey're either required or addressable.\n\n77\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.950\nThis one is really kind of interesting.\n\n78\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.990\nIt's a little sidenote.\n\n79\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.880\nYou don't have to know this for the exam.\n\n80\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.140\nBut again, it's good to know.\n\n81\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.390\nAnd that is that,\n\n82\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.990\nif something is addressable that does\nnot mean that it's not required.\n\n83\n00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.720\nIt just means that if\nyou decide not to do it\n\n84\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.490\nyou had better have good reasons\nnot to and have it documented.\n\n85\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.810\nAnd a perfect example is,\nfolks again this is not on the test, so\n\n86\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.980\nixnay on the writing this\ndown if you don't want to.\n\n87\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.280\nEncryption of data at rest is not\nrequired under HIPAA regulations,\n\n88\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.840\nhowever it is addressable.\n\n89\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.530\nWhich means,\n\n90\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.280\nif you don't encrypt your data at rest,\nyou better have a good reason, and\n\n91\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.870\nit better be documented or you're going\nto get called on the carpet for it later.\n\n92\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.390\n>> Interesting.\n\n93\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.080\n>> So, yeah, it is, it's an interesting\nform that really only seems to apply.\n\n94\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.130\nI'm not sure who came up with, or why,\nor how they came up with that kind of\n\n95\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.660\nlanguage but it's really interesting\nin that they call it addressable,\n\n96\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.330\nbut it really means is,\nit's required but if you can\n\n97\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.500\njustify not doing it you can get away with\nit but you better have really good reason.\n\n98\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.400\nBecause it's the first thing I'm gonna\nlook at is how many of these requirements\n\n99\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.100\nthat are addressable have you not done?\n\n100\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.850\n>> Right.\n\n101\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.810\n>> And, I wanna see the documentation.\n\n102\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.034\n>> Are you spending all of your time\ntrying to meet these addressable issues or\n\n103\n00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:23.359\nare you spending all of your time coming\nup with excuses to avoid having to deal\n\n104\n00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:23.937\nwith those?\n\n105\n00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:24.808\n>> For why you're not.\n\n106\n00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:25.957\n>> Yes.\n\n107\n00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:29.848\nSo I would think you'd want them to, if\nyou're avoiding every single one of them,\n\n108\n00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.165\nyeah something's wrong.\n\n109\n00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:32.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n110\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.370\nExactly.\n\n111\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.450\nSo again that's just a little\nside note piece of information.\n\n112\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.090\nIt's not gonna be on the test or\nanything like that.\n\n113\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.718\nAnother group of regulatory\nrequirements fall under what's\n\n114\n00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:47.050\ncalled the Gramm Leach Bliley Act.\n\n115\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.487\nGLBA is what we call it in banking for\nshort, because if you try and\n\n116\n00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:52.800\nsay Gramm Leach Bliley\nthree times in a row,\n\n117\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.655\nyou'll probably spit your\ntongue out on the street.\n\n118\n00:06:55.655 --> 00:06:57.675\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a mouthful.\n\n119\n00:06:57.675 --> 00:07:00.990\nBut the Gramm Leach Bliley Act is the act,\n\n120\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.500\nI don't recall at the moment\nthe exact year it was passed, but\n\n121\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.170\nit actually requires banks to have\nan official information security program.\n\n122\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.990\nIt's called the ISP.\n\n123\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.250\nIt's absolutely required under the law.\n\n124\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.910\nIt's not optional,\nit's not addressable, it is required.\n\n125\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.990\nAnd there are certain standards and\nguidelines listed in that\n\n126\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.630\nas well as strong recommendations\nabout certain types of policies.\n\n127\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.560\nThe act, much like the HIPAA act,\ncalls out that the bank\n\n128\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.750\nmust in fact name a security officer for\nthe organization.\n\n129\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.971\nDoesn't say what their qualifications\nneed to be, or anything like that, but\n\n130\n00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:44.361\nthere must be a named one.\n\n131\n00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:50.891\nNow, one of the interesting things in\nbanking that's a little bit different\n\n132\n00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:57.722\nthan in healthcare is that in banking very\nclearly in the GLBA regs it calls out and\n\n133\n00:07:57.722 --> 00:08:01.841\nstates that the organization Must,\nnot shall,\n\n134\n00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:07.469\nmust provide adequate resources\nincluding financial in order for\n\n135\n00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:13.620\nthe security officer to carry\nout the functions of their job.\n\n136\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.410\n>> Interesting\n>> So\n\n137\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.230\nwhat that means is, if i'm an FDIC\nauditor, and I come in to your bank and\n\n138\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:24.050\nI find that your security officer can't\nget his or her initiatives accomplished\n\n139\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.610\nbecause they're not being funded by the\nboard, the board's gonna get written up.\n\n140\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.860\nThat is gonna be a finding.\n\n141\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.610\n>> Interesting.\n\n142\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.450\n>> Yeah, so again, it goes back to what\nwe talked about in one of the previous\n\n143\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.960\nepisodes, where we're finding that\nboth regulatory environment and\n\n144\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.260\njust culturally, we're beginning\nto drive responsibility for\n\n145\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.680\nmanaging these risks,\nback up to the board of directors.\n\n146\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.020\nIt's no longer something that can be\nrelegated to the IT department, or\n\n147\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.300\neven to your internal auditors, it has to\nbe embraced by senior level management,\n\n148\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.660\nor there's gonna be some price to pay for\nthat.\n\n149\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.750\n>> And that's a good thing, I see in\na lot of these organizations sometimes\n\n150\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.710\nit is tough to get by, and from those\nupper levels to spend money on things that\n\n151\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.280\nare going to protect us, but\nthere's no immediate results from it.\n\n152\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.368\nSo sometimes it's hard to get them\nto spend money on things like that.\n\n153\n00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:17.017\n>> Right.\n>> Where as you try to explain to\n\n154\n00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:19.900\nthem if that you don't spend\nthe money this is what could happen.\n\n155\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.730\nThey're like, yeah maybe but.\n\n156\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:27.520\n>> Yeah that's exactly why, that's exactly\n\n157\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.010\nwhy it's written into the regulation,\nyou do not have a choice with it.\n\n158\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.780\nIt's very clear in there\nthat it's required.\n\n159\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.530\nThe DHHS regs, Department of Health and\nHuman Services, who administers\n\n160\n00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.260\nthe HIPAA regulations, comes pretty\nclose to doing the same thing, and\n\n161\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.680\nwe're seeing more and\nmore organizations do that.\n\n162\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.230\nSomehow try to put it in\neither contractually,\n\n163\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.730\nor somehow in legislation,\nbut again banking is such\n\n164\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.180\na critical part of our infrastructure\nthat the powers that be decided\n\n165\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.410\na long time ago that it was not something\nthat was optional, it's very mandatory.\n\n166\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.170\n>> That's good.\n\n167\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.800\n>> So, on another side note,\n\n168\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.990\nI always look towards banking regulations,\nif you go back and read the early work\n\n169\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:19.100\non Cobit that ISACA did,\nand the COSA Organization,\n\n170\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.660\nyou'll find that most all of these rules\nand regulations that were promulgated\n\n171\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.440\nover the last 50 or 60 years,\nhave come from the banking industry.\n\n172\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.764\nAnd the reason is because the risk is so\nhigh there.\n\n173\n00:10:29.764 --> 00:10:34.141\nWe talked in the previous episode this\nmorning, and I checked while at lunch,\n\n174\n00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.206\nthe loss of the bank in\nBangladesh was $15 million.\n\n175\n00:10:37.206 --> 00:10:38.786\n>> Wow, 15 million.\n\n176\n00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:43.322\n>> Yeah, due to a technical error, and of\ncourse the Swift organization claim that\n\n177\n00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:46.457\nhad nothing to do with their software,\ntheir systems,\n\n178\n00:10:46.457 --> 00:10:50.360\nthat it was totally the banks fault,\nbut the money's gone.\n\n179\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.040\n>> Wow.\n\n180\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.110\n>> We'll come back to\nthat story another day.\n\n181\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.618\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I guess the point is that in the US,\n\n182\n00:10:57.618 --> 00:11:03.635\nbanking regulations require that the board\nof directors be intimately involved, they\n\n183\n00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:09.105\nmust actually sign off on the security\nprogram every year, at least annually.\n\n184\n00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:11.962\nAnd I saw a CEO get written up for\nthis one time,\n\n185\n00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:16.502\nthere actually has to be documentation\nin the board of director minutes,\n\n186\n00:11:16.502 --> 00:11:21.119\nwhere the security officer delivered\nthe annual security program updates\n\n187\n00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:26.060\nto the board of directors and\nthat they were agreed upon and accepted.\n\n188\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.040\n>> Wow.\n>> He got written up because even\n\n189\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.450\nthough they did it they didn't put it\nin the minutes, boom, got a finding.\n\n190\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.030\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n191\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.290\n>> And in banking what that means,\na finding typically in\n\n192\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.720\nother environments that might\nlead to a fine or such.\n\n193\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.930\nTypically in banking it's a little\ndifferent than that, they give you\n\n194\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:50.920\na little time to get things squared away,\nbut it's a mark on your record.\n\n195\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.560\nSo if you have for instance, they call\nthem memorandums requiring attention or\n\n196\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.540\nmemorandums requiring immediate attention,\nthings like that,\n\n197\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.610\nwhat that means is it's kind of like\nthe IRS if you don't pay your taxes.\n\n198\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.630\nThey're gonna red flag you\nthe next time they do an audit and\n\n199\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.770\nthey're going to really take a deep\ndive to make sure you're doing\n\n200\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.230\nthe things that you're doing,\nand they're not going to let up\n\n201\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.900\nuntil they've gone through a couple more\naudits where there's none of those left.\n\n202\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.600\n>> So it increases the scrutiny that\nthey're going to face when they go through\n\n203\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.660\ntheir next audit, until they start showing\nthat they're doing their due diligence.\n\n204\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.430\n>> Absolutely.\n\n205\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.220\nAbsolutely.\n\n206\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.489\nIt's pay now or pay later, plain and\nsimple in the audit world.\n\n207\n00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:30.910\n[LAUGH] Yeah, if you don't pay,\nyou're going to sooner or later.\n\n208\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.350\nSo then the last one of regulatory\nrequirements that I wanted to talk\n\n209\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.480\na little bit about was FISMA,\n\n210\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.240\nwhich is the Federal Information\nSecurity Management Act.\n\n211\n00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.544\nI've got something up on the screen if you\n\n212\n00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:42.550\ncould have-\n>> Sure.\n\n213\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.250\n>> Titus pick that up for us.\n\n214\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.922\nIt's a definition, it was passed in 2002.\n\n215\n00:12:47.922 --> 00:12:52.002\nLet me see if I can blow this up\njust a little bit without losing\n\n216\n00:12:52.002 --> 00:12:53.290\nit off the screen.\n\n217\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.320\nThere, so everybody can read that.\n\n218\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.140\nYou do need to be familiar with\nthese regulatory requirements.\n\n219\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.510\nYou don't need to know them\nin any intimate detail.\n\n220\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.865\nYou just should know that HIPAA's\ndifferent than FISMA, and FFIC or\n\n221\n00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:08.510\nGWE's different from FISMA.\n\n222\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.670\nFISMA is the act that was signed\nin 2002 that actually governs\n\n223\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.200\nall federal information systems.\n\n224\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.940\nThere are actually a subset of these\nregulations today called FedRAMP,\n\n225\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.740\nwhich is a smaller subsection for\ncloud service providers only,\n\n226\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.280\nto tell them how they must\nconfigure their systems,\n\n227\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.080\ndefine the boundaries of those systems,\nIT systems etc,\n\n228\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.460\nin order to do business with\nthe federal government.\n\n229\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.430\nOkay, so these are musts.\n\n230\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.776\nYeah you can go ahead and close that.\n\n231\n00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:45.495\nThese are musts, you can't get away with.\n\n232\n00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:47.340\n>> It's not a shall or should.\n\n233\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:47.898\n>> No.\n\n234\n00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:48.617\nNot at all.\n\n235\n00:13:48.617 --> 00:13:50.560\nYou must or it doesn't fly.\n\n236\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.490\nAnd quite honestly,\nthat's one of the reasons why, and\n\n237\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:58.695\nI know people will jump on\nthe OMB breach of late, and Mr.\n\n238\n00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:03.379\nSnowdon's releases etc, but\nby and far when you look at\n\n239\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:10.030\nthe banking system overall,\nand the federal government,\n\n240\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:15.770\nthe number of breaches and\nintrusions actually is pretty small.\n\n241\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.710\nThey really do a pretty\ngood job of managing,\n\n242\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.250\nwe forget that sometimes\nbecause we like the headlines.\n\n243\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.457\n>> They're sensational, they make\nthe news because it's government or\n\n244\n00:14:24.457 --> 00:14:29.012\nit's lots of money, but if you saw the\nnumber of attacks that were thwarted or\n\n245\n00:14:29.012 --> 00:14:31.886\nnever succeeded that happen per day or\nper hour,\n\n246\n00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:35.562\nyou'd realize that they're\nreally doing a pretty good job.\n\n247\n00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:38.627\n>> Yeah exactly, and so\nyou know you're talking about,\n\n248\n00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:43.293\nwith the federal government that's not\neven counting the Department of Defense,\n\n249\n00:14:43.293 --> 00:14:47.354\nall the black networks that they have\nthat we don't even know about, and\n\n250\n00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:51.883\nhow they protect all those, and of course\nif there was a breach we would never know\n\n251\n00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:56.295\nabout, they would never tell us because\nof national security excuse me etc.\n\n252\n00:14:56.295 --> 00:15:01.430\nBut, we live in a hyper\nconnected world today where PCI,\n\n253\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.680\nHIPAA, GLBA, and\nFISMA all touch each other.\n\n254\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.520\nThese don't run in\nindependent silos anymore,\n\n255\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.580\nthey're all touching\neach other all the time.\n\n256\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.070\nFor instance, you go to a VA hospital,\nthey have HIPAA responsibilities, but\n\n257\n00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.865\nthey're part of the Federal Government,\nso they also have FISMA responsibilities.\n\n258\n00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:23.456\nAnd guess what, everybody there pays with\na credit card if they're buying medicine\n\n259\n00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:26.150\nor that kind of stuff even though\nthey have veteran's benefits,\n\n260\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.090\nthere are still copays involved sometimes,\nand they pay for\n\n261\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.290\nall that with credit cards, which\ngoes back through our banking system.\n\n262\n00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.320\nSo they're all super hyper connected,\nyou simply can't extract them and\n\n263\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.070\npretend like they're in silos anymore.\n\n264\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:45.004\nSo, what that really does is bring me\nto my next topic for this episode,\n\n265\n00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:46.252\nwhich is IT risk.\n\n266\n00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:49.324\nAnd talking a little bit about,\nin the previous episodes\n\n267\n00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:53.804\nwe talked about risk in general, we talked\nabout enterprise risk management, but\n\n268\n00:15:53.804 --> 00:15:56.364\nwe haven't actually\ntalked about IT risk yet.\n\n269\n00:15:56.364 --> 00:15:59.882\nSo I wanna, wink wink,\nwrite this down, it's in the book.\n\n270\n00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:01.844\nIt's in the study materials.\n\n271\n00:16:01.844 --> 00:16:04.630\nIT risk is business risk.\n\n272\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.040\nBusiness risk associated with\nownership and operation of IT assets.\n\n273\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.150\nNow what's an IT asset?\n\n274\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.940\nServers, software,\nhardware, human capital,\n\n275\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.980\nyour operators, the people who take care\nof all of that stuff, those are IT assets.\n\n276\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.730\nWithout them, you're broke.\n\n277\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.410\n>> That's right.\n\n278\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.970\n>> You know, after you have a power outage\non the weekend and everything shuts down,\n\n279\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.570\neverybody is off on the golf course,\nthat's an asset you can't have.\n\n280\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.950\nThey even, Isaac even goes down into\nidentifying things like firm work\n\n281\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.060\nand the most important point I\nwanna make about IT risk and\n\n282\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.980\nthe asset aspect is\ntalking about inventories.\n\n283\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.730\nThis is one of the most boring topics-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.500\n>> In the entire [LAUGH] study guide or\n\n285\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.330\nin the world of IT audit.\n\n286\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.640\nBut it's extremely important.\n\n287\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.790\nHere's why, if you don't have proper and\nadequate inventories,\n\n288\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.060\nyou don't have any visibility into\nyour complete inventory of risk.\n\n289\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.010\nBecause it's those assets that you own\nthat bring risk to the organization,\n\n290\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.630\nit's the ownership, operation,\netc., of those assets.\n\n291\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.850\nWell if there's 12 of them that you\ndon't know about that's unknown risk.\n\n292\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.705\nYou're not managing-\n>> Right.\n\n293\n00:17:28.705 --> 00:17:30.830\nMm-hm.\n>> That's extremely dangerous.\n\n294\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.420\nAn old, this is an old story\nhappened 30 years ago.\n\n295\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.530\nWhen I was first starting up in IT down in\nIndianapolis a very good friend of mine.\n\n296\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.360\nAn old New Horizons\ninstructor of mind actually.\n\n297\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.460\nWho taught me everything\nI know about Novell and\n\n298\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.170\nIP, was doing a group wise migration for\n\n299\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.380\nthe school system, and one of the first\ntasks he did was a complete network scan.\n\n300\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.560\nNow we're talking mid 90s.\n\n301\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.420\nThat's real rocket science back then.\n\n302\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.510\nYou didn't have tools.\n\n303\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.290\nYou did everything from raw keyboard.\n\n304\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.752\nAnd we discovered a Novell 2.1\n\n305\n00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:10.720\nserver running in one of the school system\nthe school didn't even know they had.\n\n306\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.370\n>> Really?\n>> [LAUGH] It was actually in a closet\n\n307\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.040\nwith the door shut.\n\n308\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.470\nNobody ever bothered,\nno one even knew what was on it.\n\n309\n00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.290\nBut it was sitting there\njust chugging away, and\n\n310\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.150\nwhen you did a sweep of the network,\nit showed up.\n\n311\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.190\n>> You saw it, right?\n\n312\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.330\nYeah so knowing what those assets are,\nwhere they are, what they're doing, etc.,\n\n313\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.680\nis vitally important.\n\n314\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.440\n>> Absolutely, if that's sitting in\na closet, it's not being patched,\n\n315\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.030\nit's not being maintained at all,\nso who knows what's going on.\n\n316\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.420\nIt could have been, I don't know if we had\nWarez servers back then but it could have\n\n317\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.600\nbeen doing any number of things that you\nprobably didn't want on that network.\n\n318\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.210\n>> Right.\nExactly.\n\n319\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.420\nIt was probably host to some gaming\nstuff cause it was only a two x server\n\n320\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.840\nwhich was basically doss\nremember in those days.\n\n321\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.170\nSome students in the classroom\nprobably playing games on it.\n\n322\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.160\nNot World of WarCraft or\nanything like that.\n\n323\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.110\n>> No.\n>> But anyway.\n\n324\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:03.850\nAnd then you know to bring that up\ninto a more modern day scenario,\n\n325\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.350\nthis is something that I talk about\nall the time and that's shadow IT.\n\n326\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.230\nThat's not something that's on the test,\nit's not even in the book.\n\n327\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.000\nBut it's something as professionals\nwe run into all the time.\n\n328\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.180\nIt's important you know what that's about.\n\n329\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.670\nShadow IT is when I come into a network\nlike this, and I connect to the wireless,\n\n330\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.139\nand they have no idea that I've done that.\n\n331\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.920\nOr, maybe they do know that I do it, but\n\n332\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.730\nit's not with an authorized device, it's\nnot with something that's been scanned or\n\n333\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.480\nhad preinstalled software checked on it,\netc.\n\n334\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.720\nOr when one of the, maybe one of your\nfilm editors needs some more space or\n\n335\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.560\nneeds to move something to another office\nand he throws it up on DropBox real quick,\n\n336\n00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.640\nbecause he's got a free DropBox account.\n\n337\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.770\nYou don't know anything about that.\n\n338\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.200\nYou have no visibility into that.\n\n339\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.820\n>> Here's your corporate data\nleaving your secured environment and\n\n340\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.330\ngoing out to a public cloud server.\n\n341\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.770\n>> Exactly,\nthat corporate data is an asset and\n\n342\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.290\nyou've lost complete track of that.\n\n343\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.960\nSo what you've done is lost track\nof the risk associated with it.\n\n344\n00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.500\nSo that's why it seems like we're such\nbullies, being security and audit people,\n\n345\n00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.720\nwhen we start coming down hard on\nfolks about data loss prevention or\n\n346\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.650\nDLP and\nwe talk about content filtering for\n\n347\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.660\nwebsites so that users aren't going\nwherever they want to go, etc, etc, etc.\n\n348\n00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.460\nIt's because with the proliferation\nof tablets and phones,\n\n349\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.370\netc, and other devices It's extremely\nhard to track all those assets and\n\n350\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.620\nbe able to manage those\nin an effective way.\n\n351\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.550\nWe won't even get into BYOD.\n\n352\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.450\nWe'll talk about that in another session.\n\n353\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:40.470\nBut, so that's kinda what I wanted to talk\nabout in terms of knowing your IT assets.\n\n354\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.610\nI use the term visibility all the time,\ncuz I'm an old network jock.\n\n355\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.100\nI started out in Layer 2 and\n3 and 4 and 1.\n\n356\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.690\nAnd so i think of visibility,\n\n357\n00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.790\nbeing able to touch all of\nthose assets somehow, someway.\n\n358\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.490\nAnd when you lose touch capability or\n\n359\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.320\nvisibility, your risk just\ngoes up dramatically.\n\n360\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.600\n>> Alright, well Brian, again,\n\n361\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.370\na lot of great information there in the\nworld of governance and management and IT.\n\n362\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.860\nRemember, if you guys want to get a more\nin depth look at any of the material that\n\n363\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.580\nwe're going over, it's all coming\nstraight out of the book that Brian\n\n364\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.160\nis one of the authors of,\nthe Cybex CISA study guide fourth

00:00:17.060\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.760\ntoday we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.180\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.620\nwe're continuing our conversation\non governance and management of IT.\n\n7\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.760\nI want to remind everybody that if you\nneed a little more in depth coverage,\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.490\nmake sure you go pick up a copy\nof the Sybex CISA study guide,\n\n9\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.970\nfourth edition of which, Mr.\nBrian O'Hara is one of the authors, and\n\n10\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.310\nhe happens to be sitting\nnext to me right now.\n\n11\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.530\nHow's it going, Brian?\n\n12\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.060\n>> Hi, Mike, good.\n\n13\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.210\nThanks for having me again.\n\n14\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.650\nToday we're gonna talk a little\nbit more about Domain two and\n\n15\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.920\nthe ISACA exam prep series having to do\nwith governance and management of IT.\n\n16\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.400\nIn the previous episodes, we've talked a\nlittle bit about regulatory requirements,\n\n17\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.770\nthings like HIPAA, GLBA, FISMA, etc.\n\n18\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.350\nAnd even talked about some examples of\nplaces where those have been implemented.\n\n19\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.360\nI wanna make sure all the students out\nthere understand that they need to be\n\n20\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.040\nfamiliar with those terms.\n\n21\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.440\nYou do not have to understand them in\nany depth or detail for the ISOCA exam,\n\n22\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.530\nbut it is helpful for you to understand\nthat they are regulatory requirements and\n\n23\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.520\nhow they fit into the world of IT audit.\n\n24\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.030\nAnd then lastly we talked a little bit\nabout we got started talking about IT risk\n\n25\n00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.480\nbeing the business risk associated with\nownership at operation of IT assets.\n\n26\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.510\nIn this episode I'd like to pick\nthat conversation back up and\n\n27\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.060\nstart off by talking\nabout risk management.\n\n28\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.240\nIn the previous episodes we talked\na little bit about enterprise risk\n\n29\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.960\nmanagement, we talked about\n>> IT risk a little bit.\n\n30\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.790\n>> IT risk a little bit, etc.\nYeah, sorry.\n\n31\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.210\nAnd today we want to start talking\na little bit about down in the weeds\n\n32\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.770\nspecifics about risk management and\nhow it all fits into the IT audit world.\n\n33\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.415\nRisk management definition,\nwrite this down.\n\n34\n00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:17.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good students out there.\n\n35\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.650\nIt's in the book.\n\n36\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.570\nIt's also in the ISOCA study guides.\n\n37\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.370\nRisk management is the coordinated\nactivities, coordinated being key.\n\n38\n00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.920\nIt means not one person's doing this,\nokay.\n\n39\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.949\nCoordinated activities to manage\nIT risk to acceptable levels.\n\n40\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.280\nMike's gonna ask me now,\nwhat are acceptable levels, right?\n\n41\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.870\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n42\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.920\nThat's what my question is.\n\n43\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.680\nHow do we know what\nan acceptable level is?\n\n44\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.820\nIs there a standard for that or does that\nvary amongst different organizations?\n\n45\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.500\n>> Yeah.\n>> Who determines what it is?\n\n46\n00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.720\n>> Yeah, so, that's the loaded\n$64 million question of the day.\n\n47\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.390\nIs, what is an acceptable level?\n\n48\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.210\nFor some of this,\n\n49\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.990\nyou'll have to go back to the previous\nepisodes where we talked about the IT\n\n50\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.000\nstrategy, the overall business\nstrategy of the organization, ect.\n\n51\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.270\nBecause what acceptable levels\nreally means is that your activities\n\n52\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.010\naround managing IT risk bring them\nto a level that's commensurate with,\n\n53\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.900\nwhat we consider or what we call\nthe organizations risk appetite, or\n\n54\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.250\nrisk tolerance level.\n\n55\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.260\nA good example of this might be,\nlet's take a bank and an investment house.\n\n56\n00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.500\nThere's two good examples,\nboth in financial services, correct?\n\n57\n00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.290\nSo both have a lot of the same kinds of.\n\n58\n00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.060\nRegulations around the banking being GLBA,\ndepending on the kind of financial\n\n59\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.950\nservices it could SEC guidelines,\nor something like that.\n\n60\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.940\nBoth in financial services, though,\nvery different risk profiles.\n\n61\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.570\nA bank tends to be very risk averse.\n\n62\n00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.740\nThey wanna make sure that they have\ncollateral's for their home loans,\n\n63\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.280\nor mortgages they give out.\n\n64\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.820\nIf you want to buy a new car and\n\n65\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.830\nfinance with them, they're going to make\nsure that they've got a title to that car,\n\n66\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.800\nthey've got a lien on it in\ncase you default on the loan.\n\n67\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.070\nThey may ask for a second signer, etc.\n\n68\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.640\nVery risk averse organization.\n\n69\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.280\nSo the activities, or excuse me,\nthe acceptable levels for\n\n70\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.980\na bank will be very different than\nthey are for an investment house.\n\n71\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.560\nAn investment house makes\nprofit by taking risks.\n\n72\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.090\nSo, now that doesn't mean\nthey take undue risk.\n\n73\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.850\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n74\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.810\nThey do their homework very well,\nthey're very well versed in that, but\n\n75\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.950\nthey make profit by taking risks.\n\n76\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.440\nSo the riskier they're.\n\n77\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.730\nExcuse me.\nThe riskier their investments become,\n\n78\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.970\nthe potential for more profit.\n\n79\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.660\nNow occasionally they lose.\n\n80\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.140\nAnd they have all of their\nformulas that they use.\n\n81\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.140\nI can't even begin to talk to\nyou about how risk managers and\n\n82\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.220\ninvestment firms work.\n\n83\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.560\nIt's extremely complicated work.\n\n84\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.140\nBut they're obviously very good at it.\n\n85\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.140\nOur investment houses completely\nrebuilt themselves after the burnout\n\n86\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.290\nin 2008 and 2009.\n\n87\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.810\nWe don't need to have a conversation\nabout whether that was right or\n\n88\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.780\nwrong in terms of who got bailed out.\n\n89\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.850\nBut the reality is, they're obviously\nback on track and making lots of money.\n\n90\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.780\nSo to answer the question,\nwhat's an acceptable level?\n\n91\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.760\nIt has to do with your organization's risk\ntolerance, or what we call risk appetite.\n\n92\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.290\nHow aggressively do they seek risk.\n\n93\n00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.258\nWhat happened in the housing\ncrisis crash back in '08 and\n\n94\n00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:29.640\n'09, was the housing\nmarket Got too aggressive.\n\n95\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.740\nAnd in doing so,\n\n96\n00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.510\nwhat they did is they started, I don't\nwanna explain all the financial stuff, but\n\n97\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.350\nthey got into derivatives, they\nstarted making riskier and riskier and\n\n98\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.510\nriskier transactions and, eventually,\nthe whole house of cards crashed.\n\n99\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.960\nAnd we all, as taxpayers,\nwound up paying the bill for that.\n\n100\n00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.080\nBut that's exactly what happened\nwas their acceptable levels or\n\n101\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.770\ntheir risk tolerance changed.\n\n102\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.640\nIt was very different than yours or mine.\n\n103\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.350\nWe have to worry about retirement.\n\n104\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.260\nWe, there's only so much out there.\n\n105\n00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.490\nIn terms of resources, so\nwe have to manage that stuff very careful.\n\n106\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.320\nAs you get older and you realize that\nthe number of years you're gonna work is\n\n107\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.315\nbecoming less and less and\ngetting into maybe sub two digits.\n\n108\n00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:14.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You start becoming a lot\n\n109\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.910\nmore conservative about how you spend\n\n110\n00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.760\nyour money-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n111\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.090\n>> And how you save your money,\nversus when you're 25 or 30.\n\n112\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.010\nAnd you think you have your\nwhole life in front of you.\n\n113\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.870\nAnd you got plenty of time\nto work things out, etc.\n\n114\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.770\nSo that's what we're really\ntalking about when we're talking\n\n115\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.790\nabout what are acceptable levels of risk.\n\n116\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.170\nThink about the young person versus\nthe retirement age person like\n\n117\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.760\nthe old fogey like me.\n\n118\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.440\nWhere I'm starting to think about gosh,\n\n119\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.790\ndo I have enough money to be able to\nstay on the beach in a nice place?\n\n120\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.650\nOr am I gonna have to go live in\na homeless shelters and work as I didn't\n\n121\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.260\nsave enough all those years that I thought\nI had the rest of my life in front of me.\n\n122\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.890\nSo, it's a very loaded term,\nI am glad you have asked the question.\n\n123\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.670\nBut it's a very important one for\nfolks to understand.\n\n124\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.650\nEvery organization you go into,\nthat answer will be different.\n\n125\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.650\nEvery single organization,\nit will be different.\n\n126\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.810\nBecause every business is different.\n\n127\n00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.530\nIn manufacturing it's different.\n\n128\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.000\nIn medical it's different.\n\n129\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.150\nImagine the risk averse\nof a medical facility.\n\n130\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.610\nExtremely risk averse.\n\n131\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.960\nThey don't want to take risks on anything\nbecause the outcome can be fatal.\n\n132\n00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.040\nOkay.\n>> And that poses another question then.\n\n133\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.320\nEven within the organization you can have\ndifferent levels of acceptable risks for\n\n134\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.030\ndifferent risks?\n\n135\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.980\n>> Say more about that.\n\n136\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.570\n>> Does that make sense?\n\n137\n00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.570\nSome risks I might be okay dealing with\nI'm trying to think of an example.\n\n138\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.890\nI might tolerate the risk of\nsomebody gaining access to\n\n139\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.960\na less secure area, but other areas that\nare more secure, I have less adversity.\n\n140\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.350\n>> Yes, I see what you're saying.\n\n141\n00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.260\n>> Does that make sense?\n\n142\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.740\n>> Yes it does make sense, yes.\n\n143\n00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.470\nExactly.\n\n144\n00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.720\nAnd so the of the type and\nthe strength of the controls\n\n145\n00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.260\nthat you use in the systems will vary\nbased on the risk associated with those.\n\n146\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.390\nSo just like you said, in the case of\nhealthcare, electronic medical records,\n\n147\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.050\nhumongous number of controls built\naround those systems because if any one\n\n148\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.060\nperson's records were compromised,\nthe ensuing\n\n149\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.160\ndisaster could be horrific,\nsomebody could die, etc.\n\n150\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.430\nSo, it's a very Fluid term.\n\n151\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.770\nAnd what I, for the exam and\nthe purposes of this conversation,\n\n152\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.320\nwhat I really wanna just stress is\nthat you need to understand that\n\n153\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.690\nthe acceptable levels will change for\nevery organization and perhaps,\n\n154\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.220\neven from project to project\ninside the same organization.\n\n155\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.230\nOrganization.\n\n156\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.760\n>> Okay.\n\n157\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.740\nSo it's a really,\nreally important concept to get down.\n\n158\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.830\nThe next one I'd like to talk about, as we\ndon't have any questions from the audience\n\n159\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.370\nthere, is the concept of\nauditor independence.\n\n160\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.020\nThese typically get a little\ncouple paragraphs in the book but\n\n161\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:02.694\nthey're extremely important from\na pragmatic or practical perspective.\n\n162\n00:09:02.694 --> 00:09:09.028\nAuditor independence means\nthat the work that you\n\n163\n00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:14.890\ndo, Is held above reproach.\n\n164\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.579\nThere can be no sign of\nconflict of interest.\n\n165\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.180\nSo for instance, and this happens all\nthe time with internal audit programs.\n\n166\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.910\nBanking is a good example because\nbanks typically have internal audit\n\n167\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.050\ndepartments because they're so many audits\ngoing on all the time that they have\n\n168\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.280\nto stay in a fairly prepared state so\nthat when external auditors show up.\n\n169\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.180\nThey already have kind\nof their ducks in a row.\n\n170\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.330\nCuz if they didn't,\nthey wouldn't survive all of them.\n\n171\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.190\nThey have far too many of those.\n\n172\n00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.340\nAuditor independence is really talking\nabout in the grandest scheme if you will,\n\n173\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.890\nin the best of worlds,\n\n174\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.530\nyou would be an external person coming\nin to do an audit for a company.\n\n175\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.940\nYou work for a third party vendor that has\nno business connections to the company.\n\n176\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.020\nThere's no political ties, there's no\nfriendships, any of that kinds of stuff.\n\n177\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.470\nYou go and do your audit work and\nit's absolutely pristine and clan and\n\n178\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.580\nclear, right?\n\n179\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.920\nYou turn in your results and\nyou walk away.\n\n180\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.050\nThat's the notion of auditor independence.\n\n181\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:26.720\nIn the real world, that rarely happens\nbecause there are always pressures from\n\n182\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:33.650\nmanagers, from sea levels,\nto perhaps ulterior results of you audit.\n\n183\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.280\nTo maybe softening the words a little bit.\n\n184\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.610\nAs an auditor you have the authority\nto do that if you feel in good\n\n185\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:48.430\nconscience that you haven't\ncomprised your ethics or\n\n186\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.280\nthe findings that would result in\nundue risk to the organization.\n\n187\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.420\nIt's a very difficult term to get.\n\n188\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.500\nAnd it's an even more difficult term\nto maintain or a different concept to\n\n189\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.750\nmaintain when typically you're going into\nan organization to perform an audit and\n\n190\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.070\nthe people you're auditing\ndon't really want you there.\n\n191\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.850\n>> Right.\n>> They really don't want you being there.\n\n192\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.320\n>> Because you're going to expose\nany place that they might not have\n\n193\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.800\ndone everything they need to\ndo to find their weaknesses.\n\n194\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.716\n>> If you're doing your\njob you will find things.\n\n195\n00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:22.850\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n196\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.730\nSo it takes, it took me a number of years\nto learn the skill of trying to put\n\n197\n00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.330\nthose people at ease and\n\n198\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.175\nto get them to understand that\nI was really on their side.\n\n199\n00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:37.550\nAnd that the reason I was doing the audit\nwas to help them protect their assets.\n\n200\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.220\nThat's changing in the art world,\nfortunately.\n\n201\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.890\nBut in years gone by,\nit's been much more horrible.\n\n202\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.710\nI think I might have mentioned to you at\nthe break a good friend of mine who was\n\n203\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.219\ndoing audit work in Detroit\nduring the 2008-2009 crash,\n\n204\n00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:55.350\nwhen the auto industry\nwas completely tanked.\n\n205\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.140\nAnd they were,\nthe city was going bankrupt, etc.\n\n206\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.540\nLots of companies going bankrupt and so\n\n207\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.270\nin order to do bankruptcy work, you have\nto have a full financial audit completed.\n\n208\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.990\nAnd that means every nook and cranny\nneeds to be looked under because people\n\n209\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:16.160\nare trying to hide resources, they're\ntrying to hide money and he got spit on.\n\n210\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.340\nFood thrown on him, his tire slashed.\n\n211\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.500\nYeah really nasty.\n\n212\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.720\n>> Wow.\n>> And that's an extreme but\n\n213\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.790\nit's pretty ugly stuff.\n\n214\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.600\nThey did not like people coming around.\n\n215\n00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.510\n>> No.\n\n216\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.050\n>> So.\nAuditor independence can at times be\n\n217\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.630\nvery tough.\n\n218\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.830\nBut it's vitally important, it's part\nof your Isaca ethical guidelines.\n\n219\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.770\nAnd it's a really important\nfunction of your job,\n\n220\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.170\nis to maintain some level of independence.\n\n221\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.340\nAs you grow in your profession, and\nyou become a little more skilled,\n\n222\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.760\nI think you'll find that you can do\nthat without insulting people, or\n\n223\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.470\nwithout hurting feelings and\njust being professional\n\n224\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.580\nabout what you do.They'll understand that\nyou're simply there trying to do your job.\n\n225\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.230\n>> Do you feel that pressure\na lot when you go out there and\n\n226\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.190\nyou're doing an audit?\n\n227\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:05.420\nDo you have people trying to present you\nwith gifts or slyly offer things or?\n\n228\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.590\n>> I've never personally\nhad that experience.\n\n229\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.680\nI know auditors who have.\n\n230\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:18.220\nAnd it's probably more because I've done a\nlarge number of industrial audits before.\n\n231\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.410\nMy biggest experience is\nin the financial sector and\n\n232\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.310\nthey've been getting audited for\nso decades.\n\n233\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.320\nThey're kind of used to it and\nthey know the rules.\n\n234\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.230\nThey know that if they got caught\ndoing something like that,\n\n235\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.615\nit could mean serious bad stuff for them.\n\n236\n00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:34.060\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> They could lose their seat in it.\n\n237\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.050\nIf they're on a publicly traded bank,\n\n238\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.450\nthey could lose their seat\non the board of directors.\n\n239\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.750\nThey could get fired.\n\n240\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.240\n>> Just for the attempt of\nmodifying an auditor's opinion or\n\n241\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.430\nif you were trying to dissuade them.\n\n242\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.990\n>> Right.\nYeah,\n\n243\n00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.620\nyou'd get brought up on criminal charges.\n\n244\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.210\n>> Wow.\n\n245\n00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:53.320\n>> So, yeah it's never happened to me but\nI know it has happened.\n\n246\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.140\nAnd it doesn't so much anymore.\n\n247\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.600\nBut you never know.\n\n248\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.640\nSo any other questions on that?\n\n249\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.240\nI don't think so.\n\n250\n00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.940\n>> Nope.\n\n251\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.370\n>> And then lastly I wanted to\ntalk about the concept today.\n\n252\n00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.700\nSeparation, or I use the term segregation.\n\n253\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.660\nThe words are actually\na little bit different, but\n\n254\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.930\nin the modern world they\nmean the same thing.\n\n255\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.730\nSeparation or segregation of duties.\n\n256\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.810\n>> Yeah, separation of duties seems\nto be a really important part\n\n257\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.119\nof the IT audit process.\n\n258\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.270\n>> It is Mike.\n\n259\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.350\nIn fact let me rewind here and\nread you a definition of that.\n\n260\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.860\nSeparation of duties,\nwrite this down students,\n\n261\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:40.320\nimportant piece to remember is\nan internal control that prevents or\n\n262\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.590\ndetects errors, irregularities\nby assigning to separate people.\n\n263\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.780\nThe responsibility for initiating and\nrecording transactions, and for\n\n264\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.520\ncustody of assets.\n\n265\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.675\n>> Wow.\nCan you put that in laymen terms for us.\n\n266\n00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:53.360\n[LAUGH].\n>> Yeah,\n\n267\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.035\nso, really what we're talking about is\nnot letting the fox guard the henhouse.\n\n268\n00:14:58.035 --> 00:15:01.610\n>> [LAUGH]. Yeah. >> We're trying to\nfind a way to separate duties, so\n\n269\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.340\nthat, no one person or\n\n270\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.790\npersons can complete a transaction without\na check and balance being in place.\n\n271\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:13.750\nThe perfect example is in a business\nwhere accounts receivable and\n\n272\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.430\naccounts payable occur.\n\n273\n00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.670\nIncome comes in,\nit needs to go into the bank account,\n\n274\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.720\nchecks need to be endorsed and put into\ndeposit that needs to go into the system,\n\n275\n00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.210\nbut then bills need to go out as well.\n\n276\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.470\nThe accounts payable.\n\n277\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.810\nTypically the accounts payable and\n\n278\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.950\nthe account receivable functions\nare completely separate so\n\n279\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.530\nthat neither one of those has any\nidea of the other transactions.\n\n280\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:40.190\nBecause if they did they could actually\ndefraud the organization of funds.\n\n281\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.110\nAnd in fact another piece of that\nin really large organizations is\n\n282\n00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.410\nnot only will they keep\nthose functions separate,\n\n283\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.350\nthey will actually rotate\nemployees through the jobs.\n\n284\n00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.980\nSo no one person stays in AR for\nmore than six or eight weeks at a time, so\n\n285\n00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.800\nthat if they were to be able to get into\ncollusion with the person in AP that that\n\n286\n00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.420\nwould break it, that those people continue\nto rotate in and out of those positions.\n\n287\n00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.740\nSo it's really designed to,\n\n288\n00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.650\nif they're just going to outright\nsteal money from you, they will, but\n\n289\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:16.830\nit keeps them from colluding together and\nsetting up defraud operations.\n\n290\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.330\nA good example of that was a bank in\nSouthern Indiana that I worked with years\n\n291\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:26.060\nago, had gone through ten years\nworth of financial audits, and\n\n292\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.150\nfor some reason,\nthe audit company never spotted anything.\n\n293\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.680\nAnd after their, this was several years\nago, after their most recent audit at that\n\n294\n00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.820\ntime, the bank president noticed something\nfunny about one of the accounts.\n\n295\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.880\nThis was a small bank.\n\n296\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.210\nSo it was very easy.\n\n297\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.770\nEverybody wore multiple hats.\n\n298\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.640\nSo AP and AR, things like that,\nweren't separated.\n\n299\n00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.580\nThis had to do with a teller.\n\n300\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.760\nAnd come to find out that this teller\nhad been siphoning money off of customer\n\n301\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.780\naccounts for over seven years.\n\n302\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.760\n>> Wow.\n>> Totaled about $2.3 million.\n\n303\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.060\n>> Holy cow.\n\n304\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.680\n>> And the auditors didn't catch it.\n\n305\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.680\nOne of the reasons I believe,\nunfortunately,\n\n306\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.520\nwas that they made the assumption\nthat because it was a small bank\n\n307\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.230\nthat they didn't really have to\nworry about any collusion going on.\n\n308\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.400\nWell didn't because it was all done by.\n\n309\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.110\nSo that's a great example\nof where separation or\n\n310\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.005\nsegregation of duties\nbecomes incredibly important.\n\n311\n00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.740\nCuz it could wind up costing\nyour organization a fortune.\n\n312\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.765\n>> It could have helped maybe even\nprevent that type of from happening.\n\n313\n00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:22.600\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n314\n00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.160\nAnother good example is in the telecom\nbusiness years ago when I was working\n\n315\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.200\nin that field, I used to work with\na number of large cellular providers.\n\n316\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.150\nAnd one of the rules that they generally\nwork with what we call a maintenance when\n\n317\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.520\nthey're on the weekends, when they\nwould make firewall up, change updates,\n\n318\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.320\nthat kinds of stuff or\nthey bring new gear online, etc.\n\n319\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.220\nSo that if it something malfunctions they\ncould either roll it back or turn it off.\n\n320\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.820\nAnd they would it between the hours\nof say 12 midnight Sunday and\n\n321\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.970\n6 AM Sunday morning so that they would\nminimize any disruption to customers.\n\n322\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.830\nBut one of the separation of duties they\ndid was they would not allow the actual\n\n323\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.880\nfirewall engineers to\nwrite any policy changes.\n\n324\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.060\nThe policy changes were written by\na completely different group of engineers.\n\n325\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.480\nHanded to the security\nfirewall engineers and\n\n326\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.630\nthe firewall engineers then proceeded\nwith implementing those policies so\n\n327\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:24.070\none person wasn't able to complete any one\npiece of the pie without the other person.\n\n328\n00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.280\n>> If that engineer that was doing the\napplication thought something was funny he\n\n329\n00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.700\nmight not have applied it.\n\n330\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.540\nSo there's no way for\nthat one person to get something done?\n\n331\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.020\n>> Right, right exactly.\n\n332\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.740\nSo you can see that the concept of\nnot only auditor independence, but\n\n333\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:43.600\nseparation of duties goes back to what we\nstarted this session with which was risk\n\n334\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.250\nmanagement and keeping those activities,\nexcuse me, making sure that those.\n\n335\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.695\nActivities continue to keep\nrisk at acceptable levels.\n\n336\n00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:57.210\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> So, that's it for this session.\n\n337\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.290\n>> All right, Brian again,\n\n338\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:03.140\nfantastic stuff, great stories in there\nand just a bunch of great information that\n\n339\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.380\nwe really need to make sure we're familiar\nwith as we prepare for this exam.\n\n340\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:07.980\nAnd remember,\n\n341\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.370\nif you want more information, you can\nalways get a copy of the book that Brian\n\n342\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.830\nis one of the authors of\nThe Sybex CISA Study Guide Fourth Edition,\n\n343\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.620\nthat's the content that we're\ncovering here in these episodes.\n\n344\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.160\nSo thank you for that Brian,\nwe appreciate it.\n\n345\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n346\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.970\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n347\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:28.990\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n348\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.013\n>>

00:00:17.384\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.330\ntoday we're doing our certified\ninformation systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.250\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.190\nwe'll be diving into information systems,\nacquisition,\n\n7\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.930\ndevelopment and implementation, if I\ncan get all that out, it's a mouthful.\n\n8\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.557\nWe got a lot to talk about.\n\n9\n00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:38.167\nSo here to help me with all of\nthat is one of the authors of\n\n10\n00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:43.704\nthe Sybex CISA Study Guide Fourth Edition,\nMr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n11\n00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:44.819\nHow you doing, Brian?\n\n12\n00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:45.975\n>> Hi Mike, good thanks.\n\n13\n00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.671\nThanks for having me again.\n\n14\n00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.977\nWell good morning out there in TV land.\n\n15\n00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.086\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:56.708\nI wanna talk a little bit about\ninformation systems, acquisition,\n\n17\n00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:59.270\ndevelopment, and implementation.\n\n18\n00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.173\nAnd I'll start off by talking a little\nbit about why that's even important.\n\n19\n00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:08.918\nOne of the ground rules or\none of the requirements that ISACA has for\n\n20\n00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:13.663\nCISA candidates, is that you be\nable to provide assurances that,\n\n21\n00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:18.492\n[COUGH] excuse me, that practices for\nthe acquisition, etc, etc,\n\n22\n00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:22.563\nand testing implementation\nof information systems meet\n\n23\n00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:26.238\nthe organization's strategies and\nobjectives.\n\n24\n00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:28.560\nYou've heard this through\na number of episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.040\nWe just finished a couple\nof episodes earlier today\n\n26\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.120\nwhere we talked a great deal about\nthe organizational strategies and\n\n27\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.160\nobjectives and\nhow that all ties to risk management.\n\n28\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.270\nThe idea being that everything we do\nin IT systems should in some way,\n\n29\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.820\nthe term I use is move\nthe ball down the field.\n\n30\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200\nIt should be helping the organization\nto meet his goals and\n\n31\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.330\nobjectives, and\nbe in line with his strategies.\n\n32\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.294\nSo if the strategy is to build 37\nmore websites next year then all\n\n33\n00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:02.715\nof the IT efforts should be,\nif that's its primary goal,\n\n34\n00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:05.785\nshould be aligned with that strategy and\n\n35\n00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:09.869\nnot get sidetracked in to\nother kinds of activities.\n\n36\n00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.940\nDid you have a question Mike?\n\n37\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.605\n>> No.\n\n38\n00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:12.758\n>> Thought maybe you had a question.\n\n39\n00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:17.803\nSo let's start off with a little\nbit about talking about how this\n\n40\n00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:24.350\nbegins to wrap things around the\norganizational strategies and objectives.\n\n41\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.840\nSo we've talked about risk, risk\nmanagement, risk management activities.\n\n42\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.650\nWe've talked about or starting to\ntalk about systems development and\n\n43\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.740\nacquisition, and you begin to\nsee how all of this wraps around\n\n44\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.650\nthe risk strategy of\nthe organization as well.\n\n45\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.791\nThat should be also in alignment with\nthe organizations, strategies and\n\n46\n00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:52.347\nobjectives and we mentioned this\nin one of the previous episodes.\n\n47\n00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:58.110\nWe're trying to manage risk to a level\nthat allows the organization to meet\n\n48\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.517\nits objectives and is aligned with its\nstrategies not necessarily choking it out.\n\n49\n00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:09.413\nBecause we think that they\nshouldn't be absorbing risk that\n\n50\n00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:14.214\nwe don't like for\nwhatever reasons we may have about that.\n\n51\n00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:19.481\nSo the first part of this\nis talking a little bit\n\n52\n00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:25.570\nabout IT supplier selection,\nand contracts, etc.\n\n53\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.268\nI call this vendor management.\n\n54\n00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:34.320\nWe'll talk about how to do\nadequate reviews of vendors.\n\n55\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.820\nOne of the key components to\nthis conversation in this\n\n56\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.420\nepisode has to do with the risk\nassociated with doing or\n\n57\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.910\nnot doing business with\na particular vendor.\n\n58\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.565\nSomething I haven't mentioned before\nmaybe it'd be useful is that when you're\n\n59\n00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:56.404\ntalking about risk,\nyou're also talking about opportunities.\n\n60\n00:03:56.404 --> 00:04:00.450\nIt's the flip side of the same coin,\nwith every risk come opportunities.\n\n61\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.900\nIn the last episode or\nin a previous episode,\n\n62\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.460\nwe talked about banking and\nfinancial investment, houses.\n\n63\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.750\nAnd how banks are typically more\nrisk averse than investment houses,\n\n64\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.910\nbecause investment houses make\ntheir money taking large risk.\n\n65\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.050\nBanks make their money and\ncontrol their income by managing risk\n\n66\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.990\nat a more effective level,\nso they're more risk averse.\n\n67\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.769\nSo I'm trying to think where I was at\nwith that sorry, had a senior moment for\n\n68\n00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:33.634\na minute there.\n\n69\n00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:36.949\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So in talking about vendor selection\n\n70\n00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.878\nwhich is a very important piece\nof working in IT systems.\n\n71\n00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:45.504\nBecause so much of what we do is\npurchasing from other vendors or\n\n72\n00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:50.587\noutsourcing services to other vendors etc,\nactivities like that.\n\n73\n00:04:50.587 --> 00:04:55.131\nThat vendor management, the selection\nprocess, how we review their,\n\n74\n00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:58.109\nthe risks that they bring\nto the organization in\n\n75\n00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:02.519\ncomparison to the opportunities tha\nthey bring to the organization.\n\n76\n00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:06.339\n>> And it's something that was sometimes,\nwe forget to think about I think when\n\n77\n00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.409\nwe're looking at vendors,\na lot of times it's bottom line.\n\n78\n00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.610\nWho's gonna give me the best bid?\n\n79\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.280\nWho's gonna give me the best price?\n\n80\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.790\nBut that doesn't always equate to the best\nchoice when it comes to a vendor, right?\n\n81\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.630\n>> It also doesn't equate to the best\nopportunity for the organization.\n\n82\n00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.870\nSo let me talk about another example we've\nmentioned in a couple of previous episodes\n\n83\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.990\nand that is the target breech.\n\n84\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.680\nThe breech occurred because\na third party vendor the HVAC or\n\n85\n00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.720\nheating and air conditioning company\nthat was managing Target's power in\n\n86\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.830\nterms of managing their power and heating\nand cooling bills to help them save money.\n\n87\n00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.190\nThere was risk associated with\ndoing business with that vendor.\n\n88\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.670\nThey assumed that that risk or\n\n89\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.040\nthey made the determination\nthat that risk was acceptable.\n\n90\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.020\nAnd what they found out later was\nthat somebody along the line didn't\n\n91\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.210\ncheck out some of the ways those\nvendors connect to the organization,\n\n92\n00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.680\nand risk came along with\ndoing business with them.\n\n93\n00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.965\nThe other side of that is,\nyou've got to have an HVAC vendor, so\n\n94\n00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:15.243\nyou can't not do business with them,\nright?\n\n95\n00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:16.273\n>> Right.\n\n96\n00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.678\n>> So you got to have somebody so\nthere is both opportunities and\n\n97\n00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.915\nrisks that go along with that.\n\n98\n00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:24.095\nThe point of risk management is to\nfind the balance of those two and\n\n99\n00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:28.741\nwhere risks are above and beyond what\nyou are willing and able to accept.\n\n100\n00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:34.620\nThen you need to put controls in place to\nbring those down to acceptable levels.\n\n101\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.999\nFor instance had a risk\nassessment been completed and\n\n102\n00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:43.010\nwe're beginning to talk about\nthat doing risk assessment work.\n\n103\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.930\nHad a risk assessment and\nadequate been completed,\n\n104\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.640\nthere's a very good chance that\nthe vulnerability that the organization\n\n105\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.800\nsuffered from would have been identified\nand controls would have been put in place.\n\n106\n00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.950\nCuz it really boil down to a very\nsimple solution of the HVAC vendor\n\n107\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.580\nwas doing a remote desktop session\ndirectly into the LAN network.\n\n108\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.890\nThere was no segmentation,\n\n109\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.120\nthey were not coming through\na secure connection, anything.\n\n110\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.167\nAnd so exposed Target's internal network\nto all kinds of vulnerabilities.\n\n111\n00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:18.127\n>> Wow.\n\n112\n00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.521\n>> A good risk assessment\nwould have identified that.\n\n113\n00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:23.850\n>> Now you say risk assessment,\nwhat do you mean by risk assessment?\n\n114\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.750\n>> Well so that's a great question.\n\n115\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:34.530\nThat's a huge part of the CISA\nknowledge base, if you will.\n\n116\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.320\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more in\ndetail about it in another session.\n\n117\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.000\nBut basically, what we're talking about is\ntaking a look at the controls that are in\n\n118\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.050\nplace, trying to identify\nvulnerabilities that are in place.\n\n119\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.247\nAnd determining whether or\n\n120\n00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:54.987\nnot the controls that you have in place\nbring the risk down to the level.\n\n121\n00:07:54.987 --> 00:07:59.684\nWe talked about that in our previous\nsection about bringing risks into line\n\n122\n00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.481\nwith your organizational.\n\n123\n00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.613\nThe organizations of goals or\nobjectives, so\n\n124\n00:08:04.613 --> 00:08:08.549\nrisk assessments is designed\nto ferret out those risks and\n\n125\n00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:13.366\nfind out if they are in fact in line\nwith the organizations tolerance and\n\n126\n00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:17.970\nif not what controls can they put\nin place to bring them in line.\n\n127\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.900\nBecause you have to assume some risk\nIn order to do business with them.\n\n128\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.250\nHowever, you need to be\nable to minimize that so\n\n129\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.350\nthat it meets your own company's\nstrategies and objectives.\n\n130\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.140\n>> Very good.\n\n131\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.040\n>> In the previous session,\n\n132\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.230\nI also talked about how that's\ndifferent from every organization.\n\n133\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.500\nFor instance, in the health care industry,\n\n134\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.340\nwith HIPAA regulations there's something\ncalled a business associate agreement.\n\n135\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:49.130\nAny health care facility, for instance,\nto not get too far in the weeds with this,\n\n136\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:54.080\na hospital, or a physician clinic,\nis what we'd call a covered entity.\n\n137\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.770\nAnyone they do business with, period,\ntoday, didn't used to be this way till\n\n138\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.240\ntwo years ago, when the,\nsome new rules were promulgated.\n\n139\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.920\nAnyone who does business with a healthcare\nentity is a business associate.\n\n140\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.700\nBusiness associates, or subcontractors, or\nvendors, or whatever term you want to use\n\n141\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.380\nfall under the exact same\nregulations as a covered entity.\n\n142\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.490\nSo if a hospital for instance, and\n\n143\n00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.900\nthis is one of the challenges we deal with\ntoday If a hospital for instance wants to\n\n144\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.330\ndo business with a small local vendor who\ndoes a really good job at what they do.\n\n145\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.920\nIn order to do business with them,\nthose subcontractors or\n\n146\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.880\nvendors have to have to\nsame kind of controls in\n\n147\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.990\nplace as the healthcare organization\nin order to do business with them.\n\n148\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.740\n>> So me as a vendor even though\nI'm not a healthcare provider, but\n\n149\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.030\nI want to do business with a healthcare\nprovider, I must then comply with HIPAA?\n\n150\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.220\n>> That's correct.\n\n151\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:03.140\nNot only that, but if you can't\nthe organization can get into some really,\n\n152\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.340\nreally dangerous territory\nwith both auditors and\n\n153\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.360\nthe federal government in terms\nof not only introducing risk that\n\n154\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.550\nthey can't manage but they can get fined\nwell into the millions of dollars for\n\n155\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.920\nnot following procedures and\npolicies under the HIPAA guidelines.\n\n156\n00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.420\nSo it can be quite expensive to get caught\ndoing business with someone who's not\n\n157\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.550\nproviding those.\n\n158\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.460\nThe idea really boils down to, and\nI've said this before, we live in such\n\n159\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.450\na hyperconnected world that anyone\nwho touches any one of those systems\n\n160\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.520\nhas to have adequate controls in place or\nsomething bad is going to go wrong.\n\n161\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.320\nIn one of the previous episodes we\ntalked about the bank in Bangladesh\n\n162\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.760\nthat just had an $18 million breach.\n\n163\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.590\nThat could have very easily\nimpacted the entire world wide or\n\n164\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.470\nat least the European Wire\ntransfer model because they touch\n\n165\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.410\nthe Swift operating system,\nwhich is the backbone for\n\n166\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.980\norganizations outside the U.S.\nto be able to do wire transfers.\n\n167\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.040\nAn adequate risk assessment\nhad not been done, and\n\n168\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.900\nas a result a breach, or\nnot a breach occurred.\n\n169\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.300\nYou could call it a breach.\n\n170\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.830\nBasically an account takeover occurred,\nof the bank, not\n\n171\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.740\na member or an account of the bank,\nbut the bank itself.\n\n172\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.255\nTheir money was stolen which is that\nobviously ergo customer's money.\n\n173\n00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:39.470\n[LAUGH] It's not really\ntheir money to begin with.\n\n174\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.750\n>> And I'm thinking about it from that\nsmall vendor side because they're doing\n\n175\n00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.250\nthe same things.\n\n176\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.860\nThey've gotta do risk assessment and look\nat that and it might be to where I look\n\n177\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.410\nat this and I think, I really wanna do\nbusiness with this healthcare provider but\n\n178\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.620\nthat means that I'm gonna\nhave to comply with HIPAA.\n\n179\n00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.040\nAnd, if I ever get out of compliance,\nthey could costs be a lot of money and\n\n180\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.790\nput me out of business.\n\n181\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.480\nSo, the risk is, I could make money\nby doing business with them or\n\n182\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.840\nI could avoid the risk by not doing\nbusiness with healthcare associates.\n\n183\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.610\n>> Right.\nAnd, in fact, one of the problems is that,\n\n184\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:14.720\nit's It's creating a barrier to entry for\nvendors who could actually do a better job\n\n185\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.830\nbut they can't afford the compliance\nrequirements to get into the business.\n\n186\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.280\nSo it's actually harming\na number of businesses and\n\n187\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.770\nI think the federal government's.\n\n188\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.230\nTrying to find ways to deal with that.\n\n189\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.080\nBut for today, it just means that\nthe hospitals, A can't afford to do\n\n190\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.510\nbusiness with you because they'll get in\ntrouble, and you may not be able to afford\n\n191\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:40.700\nto do business with them because you can't\nafford to put the controls in place.\n\n192\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.949\nBanking's in the same situation in that\n\n193\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.180\nwhile they don't have a specific\nregulation like HIPAA that says\n\n194\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.540\nanyone who does business with\nyou is required to fallow these,\n\n195\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.250\nthey have in recent years, in fact there\nhave been a couple of what we would call.\n\n196\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.390\nI forget what they're called now, they're\nnot rulings, but statements by the FFIEC,\n\n197\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.950\nwhich is the Federal Financial\nInstitution Examination Council.\n\n198\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:13.040\nThey're the people who actually\npromulgate the polices and\n\n199\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.310\nstandards, etc., from the FDIC.\n\n200\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.000\nThat anyone who does business with a bank\nin the US, falls under their jurisdiction.\n\n201\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.560\nNow they haven't begun enforcing that yet,\nbut that's the precursor to saying\n\n202\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.090\nif you're a subcontractor with a bank,\nyou'd better have GLBA in place.\n\n203\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.780\nNow if you think about that, a mom and\npop bank with what I would call mom and\n\n204\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.010\npop bank,, was say maybe six branches.\n\n205\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.690\nThat's typically a community\nfamily owned bank.\n\n206\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.950\nIt's been in the family for generations.\n\n207\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.110\nDad and grandpa were presidents.\n\n208\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.360\nThey're on the board of directors.\n\n209\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.240\nMaybe they're publicly traded,\nmaybe they're not.\n\n210\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.340\nAnd they hire Aunt Sally to clean\nthe bank building for them.\n\n211\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.360\nThat means they may not be\nable to do that in the future.\n\n212\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.590\n>> Because that person or\nthat business may not, in fact,\n\n213\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:09.040\nbe able to meet the requirements\nin order to do that.\n\n214\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.910\nAnd here's another good example.\n\n215\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.400\nOne of those little side stories\nI've talked about in other sessions,\n\n216\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.870\nwhere I was doing a bank\naudit in another state and\n\n217\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:27.040\nwas at a branch location after\nhours looking to see whether or\n\n218\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.580\nnot financial papers had been left out on\ndesktops at night, that kind of stuff.\n\n219\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.930\nI call it a clean desk policy sweep,\n\n220\n00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.710\nwhere we go into a branch unannounced\nafter hours and kind of look\n\n221\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.200\nto see if the branch managers are ensuring\nthat things are locked up at night, etc.\n\n222\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.480\nAnd came in and not only did we find,\nI shouldn't laugh about this,\n\n223\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.240\nit's not funny, but it was a small town,\ncouple of branches, not a big bank.\n\n224\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.200\nEverybody knows everybody.\n\n225\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.870\nWe found their coin counting\nmachine full and unlocked.\n\n226\n00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.980\n>> No.\n>> With about $10,000 in coins in it.\n\n227\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.060\nAnd not only that, did we discover that,\nbut while we were on site,\n\n228\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.180\nthis was with the security officer of\ncourse, the cleaning crew came in,\n\n229\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.860\nafter hours, and\ncould have taken a whole bag of money and\n\n230\n00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.630\nwalked right out the door with it and no\none would have ever known the difference\n\n231\n00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.380\nbecause it wasn't being\naudited on an on going basis.\n\n232\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.820\nAnd when we asked him about it he said\nyeah, it was pretty common practice that\n\n233\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.410\nhe would see the bags full\nof coins when he came in.\n\n234\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.760\nHonest person.\n\n235\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.280\n>> Luckily.\n>> Probably related to\n\n236\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.120\nsomebody at the bank.\n\n237\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.170\nYeah, exactly.\n\n238\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.410\nBut you can't continue to take those\nkinds of risks ad infinitum or\n\n239\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.700\nit's going to cost you problems.\n\n240\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.480\nIt's going to definitely\ncause you problems.\n\n241\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.441\nSo that's one of the, that's one\nof the areas where I came in and\n\n242\n00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:51.143\npart of what I was doing was an audit,\nbut I was also doing a risk assessment.\n\n243\n00:15:51.143 --> 00:15:55.852\nCuz any time you're doing an audit,\nyou're doing discovery work.\n\n244\n00:15:55.852 --> 00:15:59.506\nAnd that's really what risk\nassessments are about is discovery, or\n\n245\n00:15:59.506 --> 00:16:03.286\nYou wanna go into an organization,\nin a full-blown risk assessment,\n\n246\n00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:07.570\nthere are processes and procedures\nwe'll talk about in future episodes.\n\n247\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.340\nBut again, basically,\nyou're doing discovery work.\n\n248\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.240\nYou're doing what I call reconnaissance.\n\n249\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.010\nYou're going in and looking at operations\nfrom every possible angle that you can.\n\n250\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:24.860\nTrying to discover weakness is not\nto point out problem areas where\n\n251\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.720\nmaybe a bank or a healthcare facility or\nwhatever the companies you worked with is\n\n252\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.570\ndoing a bad job, but you're trying to\nexpose risk that they're unaware of.\n\n253\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.000\nRemember I talked to that early and\n\n254\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.920\nthen the previous session about\nvisibility, it's really important.\n\n255\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.560\nI would much rather know about\nthat risk than to not and\n\n256\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.300\nhave it come back to\nbite me down the road.\n\n257\n00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.030\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n258\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:51.300\nAnd sometimes I think maybe they\ntake the auditor's assessments or\n\n259\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.050\nfindings personally and that is as you've\nsaid several times, that's not what it is.\n\n260\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.260\nIt's not an attack, but I'm trying to help\nyou, I'm trying to point these things out\n\n261\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.150\nso that you can do something about it so\nthat you don't have to deal with\n\n262\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.530\nthe consequences of somebody bad\nfinding that same vulnerability.\n\n263\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:13.070\n>> All right, so one last item under\nevaluating IT supplier selection.\n\n264\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.970\nIn contract, processes etc.\n\n265\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.570\nI wanna talk a little bit about in\ndetail is, something called an SLA or\n\n266\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.510\nService Level Agreement.\n\n267\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.350\nIt's a rather important\npiece of documentation for\n\n268\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.970\nauditors to understand and be able\nto interpret and read and evaluate.\n\n269\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.530\nIt's something that I think is\njust as consumers we see a lot,\n\n270\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.780\ncuz just about everything we do we\nhave to either an electronic form\n\n271\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.130\nas we get a lot of these SLA's.\n\n272\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.221\n>> But as we probably don't have a good\nidea what's, most of us have actually\n\n273\n00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.934\nnever read to see what's in those and\nwhat they actually define.\n\n274\n00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:46.859\n>> Yeah, not very much unlike\nan End User License Agreement.\n\n275\n00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:49.755\n>> Yes. [LAUGH] >> Most of us just\ngo click, click, click, next, next,\n\n276\n00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:50.775\nnext, next.\n\n277\n00:17:50.775 --> 00:17:53.205\nYeah, service level agreements\nare pretty boring stuff.\n\n278\n00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.955\nMost of it's boiler plate.\n\n279\n00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:57.635\nHalf or\nthree fourths of it is legalese stuff.\n\n280\n00:17:57.635 --> 00:18:02.225\nBut what's really important and\nhere's where I've found this\n\n281\n00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:06.220\na number of times over the years,\nworking in banking and\n\n282\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.237\nin healthcare, is that it's not so\nmuch that the vendor is promised.\n\n283\n00:18:11.237 --> 00:18:14.935\nThe typical is, the 99.9% up time,\n\n284\n00:18:14.935 --> 00:18:18.959\nthat we'll only be down\n2 hours every year.\n\n285\n00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:23.804\nNow there's a saying at SLA that\nthat two hours can't be during your\n\n286\n00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:25.251\npeak sales season.\n\n287\n00:18:25.251 --> 00:18:28.079\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Between Thanksgiving and Christmas or\n\n288\n00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:29.154\non Black Friday.\n\n289\n00:18:29.154 --> 00:18:31.337\nWhat happens if you're out\ntwo hours on Black Friday?\n\n290\n00:18:31.337 --> 00:18:33.670\nYou're broke,\nyou're bankrupt for the year.\n\n291\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.970\nSo reading those carefully\nis really important.\n\n292\n00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.280\nAnd in particular and\nI've found this more in banks and\n\n293\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.450\nhealth care than anywhere else is that,\nthat's where I do most of my work,\n\n294\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.340\nit's still in banking and healthcare,\nI see a lot of this where\n\n295\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.910\nsenior level management doesn't\nreally read those things.\n\n296\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.494\nThey ask their IT director or their CO\nare we getting what we're paying for,\n\n297\n00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:56.296\nand most of the time the answer is yes.\n\n298\n00:18:56.296 --> 00:19:00.196\nBut the reality is you're not getting\nwhat you're paying for very often, and\n\n299\n00:19:00.196 --> 00:19:04.450\nin fact there may be a host of things that\nyou're not getting that you're paying for,\n\n300\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.788\nbut you're getting the most\nimportant stuff you're paying for.\n\n301\n00:19:07.788 --> 00:19:08.449\n>> Right.\n\n302\n00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:11.428\n>> And so as an auditor you need\nto be able to read an SLA and\n\n303\n00:19:11.428 --> 00:19:14.090\nunderstand what\nthe customer's not getting.\n\n304\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.770\nAn example of this might\nbe in a health care group I\n\n305\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.540\nworked with a couple of years ago, they\nactually brought in a separate auditor.\n\n306\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.502\nThis is a separate audit\nfrom the IT audit,\n\n307\n00:19:26.502 --> 00:19:31.866\nwhere they brought a specialist in who\nspeciality was telecommunications.\n\n308\n00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:36.213\nShe came in, this is a very\nlarge healthcare organization,\n\n309\n00:19:36.213 --> 00:19:40.729\nthey're spending well in\nthe millions every year on, shoot,\n\n310\n00:19:40.729 --> 00:19:43.696\nnot frame relay, what am I blanking on,\n>> ATM?\n\n311\n00:19:43.696 --> 00:19:44.682\n>> MPLS.\n\n312\n00:19:44.682 --> 00:19:46.190\n>> Okay.\n>> MPLS circuits.\n\n313\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.927\nThey have seven hospitals,\nlots of branches, lots of clinics, etc.\n\n314\n00:19:50.927 --> 00:19:56.381\nLots of circuits, T1s, out in some\nof the outlying areas, bonded T1s,\n\n315\n00:19:56.381 --> 00:20:02.830\nfiber here, fiber there, redundant\ncircuits across data centers, etc.\n\n316\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.960\nShe did a full audit to find out what they\nwere being billed for, and what they were\n\n317\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.810\nactually used, and she saved them in\nthe first year a half million dollars.\n\n318\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.310\n>> Wow.\n\n319\n00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.350\n>> For circuits that were being paid for\nthat weren't being utilized.\n\n320\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.550\n>> Wow.\n>> And the simple reason being that\n\n321\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.560\nan organization that size has so\n\n322\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.280\nmany moving parts that there was no\none in charge of managing all that.\n\n323\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.100\nAnd so a T1 would get bought here and\n\n324\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.640\na T1 would get bought there,\nmaybe it never got turned up.\n\n325\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.030\nWho owns all the IP ranges,\nall that stuff.\n\n326\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.078\nSo again, in the first year it\nsaved thea a half million dollars.\n\n327\n00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:32.925\n>> Wow, that is impressive.\n\n328\n00:20:32.925 --> 00:20:38.179\n>> [COUGH] In SLA Agreements with banks\nwhere they're paying for, if most\n\n329\n00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:44.790\nof you don't know this, banks have been\ngoing to the cloud long before most of us.\n\n330\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.130\nBecause the regulations have become so,\nand I don't mince words about this,\n\n331\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.900\ncrushing that they simply don't have the\nexpertise to implement lots of that stuff.\n\n332\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.680\nSo they outsource their\nfire-walling to companies,\n\n333\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.710\nI can't say the company names I guess.\n\n334\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.240\nBut they outsource a lot of that\nmanagement cuz they simply don't have\n\n335\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.500\nthe expertise.\n\n336\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.810\nNor, and this is a really important one,\n\n337\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.230\nwhen we have a conversation\nabout outsourcing.\n\n338\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.030\nIt's not their core business.\n\n339\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.180\nTheir core business is banking.\n\n340\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.357\nA hospital's core business is healthcare,\nnot building data centers,\n\n341\n00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:22.788\nnot building communication\ninfrastructures.\n\n342\n00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:27.512\nAnd what's happened to a large degree\nis and I go off a side note here for\n\n343\n00:21:27.512 --> 00:21:32.399\na minute, but I really think that\nbusinesses and organizations did this\n\n344\n00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:36.746\ninitially because there was no one\nelse around to do it for them.\n\n345\n00:21:36.746 --> 00:21:41.098\nBut they're moving more and more to\nCloud based solutions, and moving more\n\n346\n00:21:41.098 --> 00:21:45.690\nto outsourcing critical infrastructure\nmanagement activities for them.\n\n347\n00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.270\nCuz it's not their core business.\n\n348\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.190\nThey shouldn't be doing that.\n\n349\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.900\nThey should be focusing on delivering\nthe best healthcare possible.\n\n350\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:57.000\nNot having the faster network\nthan the guy in the next state\n\n351\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.990\nbecause they got more money to do A,\nB, or C, or something like that.\n\n352\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.695\n>> Yeah, that kinda rolls back\ninto our risk assessment.\n\n353\n00:22:02.695 --> 00:22:06.720\nOne of the solutions for risk is to\ntransfer that risk to somebody else.\n\n354\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.715\n>> That's right.\n>> Which is really what that health care\n\n355\n00:22:08.715 --> 00:22:12.118\norganization is doing is saying\nwe're not firewall experts.\n\n356\n00:22:12.118 --> 00:22:12.965\n>> That's right.\n\n357\n00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:15.112\n>> We're gonna outsource it and\nthe risk goes with it.\n\n358\n00:22:15.112 --> 00:22:16.000\n>> Right.\n\n359\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.910\nAnd it's just happened\nsort of historically.\n\n360\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.946\nBack in the late 90s there was no cloud,\nso everybody built their own data centers.\n\n361\n00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:29.016\nWe built these monolithic walls\naround it to try to protect him and\n\n362\n00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:31.020\nit just doesn't work anymore.\n\n363\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.240\nIt's just not the best use of resources.\n\n364\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.652\nSo, SLA's are extremely important.\n\n365\n00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:43.386\nBeing able to read them, understand them,\ngo behind another auditor and\n\n366\n00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:49.701\nread their notes in terms of how\nthey've dealt with that in the past.\n\n367\n00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.830\nExcuse me.\n\n368\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.870\nSo then,\nthe next concept I want to move on to,\n\n369\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.230\nis talking about project management.\n\n370\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.080\nWe have talked a little bit\nabout this in the past.\n\n371\n00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.560\nIn terms of information systems\nacquisition development and\n\n372\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.790\nimplementation, What we wanna\ntalk about is those information\n\n373\n00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.240\nsystem projects, the acquisition,\ndevelopment, and implementation of them.\n\n374\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.600\nAnd the two key points\nI wanna bring up are,\n\n375\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.810\nare the projects proceeding on schedule?\n\n376\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.580\nThat's the biggest problem with\nsystem acquisition, development, and\n\n377\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.050\nimplementation is Product lag time.\n\n378\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:34.120\nYou et up a project, you say we're gonna\nhave this live by September first.\n\n379\n00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.690\nYou order the systems.\n\n380\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.440\nSomething happens,\nthey get delayed in manufacturing.\n\n381\n00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.170\nThey get delayed in shipping.\n\n382\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.110\nYou don't get them in time to do adequate\n\n383\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.750\nbeta testing in a lab before you put\nthem into production, etc, etc, etc.\n\n384\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.389\nSo, a project management\nis extremely important.\n\n385\n00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.785\nAnd one of the things that ISACA\nemphasizes very strongly is timely and\n\n386\n00:23:56.785 --> 00:24:02.446\naccurate reporting of that project\nThat projects lifecycle if you will.\n\n387\n00:24:02.446 --> 00:24:07.391\nSo two terms and then we'll wrap this\nsession up, two terms that are tied\n\n388\n00:24:07.391 --> 00:24:12.560\nto that are called total cost of\nownership and return on investment.\n\n389\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.600\nWink wink.\n\n390\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.980\nWrite those down, look them up they're\nin the book do some googling on them\n\n391\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.800\nmake sure you understand,\nwhat they are and the difference.\n\n392\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.030\nTotal cost of ownership has to do with,\nit's just a pure simple definition.\n\n393\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.940\nWhat did it cost you to own that\nin terms of not just the hardware,\n\n394\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.400\nnot the hardware and the software,\nbut the time it took your staff to\n\n395\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.260\nbuild it, deploy it, test it,\nput it into production.\n\n396\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.950\nAll of those go into\ntotal cost of ownership.\n\n397\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.310\nAnd what happens often times is you'll\nsee vendors talk about TCO terms\n\n398\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.720\nthat don't include all that.\n\n399\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.050\nThey have typically tendency\nto include just the actual\n\n400\n00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.870\nphysical cost of the devices or\nthe software.\n\n401\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.700\nThe return on the investment,\nthat's a really nebulous term.\n\n402\n00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:06.710\nI would bet that most of you like me have\nthought for years that when you're buying\n\n403\n00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.540\nhardware, you're investing in the company,\nor when you're buying software.\n\n404\n00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.730\nYou're not.\n\n405\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.560\nIt's actually a purchase.\n\n406\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.870\nOkay?\nYou're not investing.\n\n407\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:22.920\nYou're investing in the hope that\nyou will earn money with that,\n\n408\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.970\nbeyond it's lifetime.\n\n409\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.230\nSo, you're purchasing it,\n\n410\n00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.310\nyou write it down over three\nyears in your accounting cycle.\n\n411\n00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.520\nAnd then, it becomes an investment.\n\n412\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.780\nBut initially,\nit's really just a purchase.\n\n413\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.849\nWhat happens if you spend 80,000 or\n100,000 dollars, on a new\n\n414\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.190\nvirtual infrastructure, and\nit crashes and burns in three years.\n\n415\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.860\nWas that an investment?\n\n416\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.440\nOr was that a purchase.\n\n417\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.970\nYou still had to pay the bill so\nit was a purchase.\n\n418\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.450\nIn my opinion it really doesn't\nbecome an investment until\n\n419\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.800\nafter it begins to pay back beyond\nwhat it cost you initially.\n\n420\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.070\nAn investment is something typically that\nstarts to pay you dividends immediately.\n\n421\n00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.020\nWhen you invest money in the stock market,\n\n422\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.340\nyou expect to get returns immediately,\ndon't you?\n\n423\n00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.420\n>> Yes.\n>> With hardware,\n\n424\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.342\nacquisition and development and\nimplementation, that rarely occurs.\n\n425\n00:26:12.342 --> 00:26:16.220\n>> So your ROI doesn't really occur\nuntil you've finished paying for it,\n\n426\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.490\nthen it's no longer a purchase.\n\n427\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.200\n>> Til it's already written\ndown off your books.\n\n428\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.150\nYeah, exactly.\n\n429\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:25.740\nBut nevertheless, I don't want to get into\narguing tomatoes and tomatoes over that.\n\n430\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.380\nMake sure you understand\nthat those two terms,\n\n431\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.200\nyou're gonna hear them more as\nwe go through the next sessions.\n\n432\n00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.660\nAnd I think that's probably a wrap for\nthis one.\n\n433\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.225\n>> All right Bryan, again, fantastic\nstuff, you've got me riveted here.\n\n434\n00:26:38.225 --> 00:26:40.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hope you guys out there are enjoying it\n\n435\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.460\nas much as I am.\n\n436\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.440\nRemember, if you wanna get a more in depth\nlook at any of this information as you're\n\n437\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.090\npreparing for the exam, go out and pick\nup a copy of the book that Brian helped\n\n438\n00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.930\nwrite, the Sybex CISA Study Guide,\nFourth Edition.\n\n439\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.240\nSo make sure that's on your desk.\n\n440\n00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.340\nAll right, Brian, again, great episode.\n\n441\n00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.290\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n442\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.270\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n443\n00:27:04.270 -->

00:00:18.546\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing our\n\n4\n00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.966\nCertified Information Systems Auditor,\nand specifically in this episode we're\n\n5\n00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:27.259\nactually continuing on our conversation,\ndealing with information systems,\n\n6\n00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.320\nacquisition development and\nimplementation.\n\n7\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.460\nAnd here with me today\nis one of the authors\n\n8\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.650\nof the Sybex CISA Study Guide\nFourth Edition, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.610\nHow you doing Brian?\n\n10\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360\n>> Hi Mike, good, thanks,\nthanks again for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.780\nSo in today's session, I'd like to start\noff talking about, we're at the point\n\n12\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.130\nin the sessions where we begin talking\nabout software development life cycle, or\n\n13\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.730\nsystem development life cycle tools and\ntechniques.\n\n14\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.790\nI wanna make sure that viewers\nunderstand that they can go to get\n\n15\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.849\nmore information, not only at\nthe CSI study guide in the book,\n\n16\n00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.495\nbut also to the ISACA website, Isaca.org.\n\n17\n00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:12.150\nThere's more information on the SDLC tools\nand techniques located there as well.\n\n18\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.310\nBut before we get started with that,\n\n19\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.440\nI wanna talk just a little bit about gap\nanalysis and vulnerability management,\n\n20\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.420\nthose are two concepts that you'll\nneed to be familiar with for\n\n21\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.550\nyour CISA exam coming up here,\nhopefully in the next month or so.\n\n22\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.130\nGap analysis is a concept that\nhas to do with the difference\n\n23\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.759\nbetween where an organization would\nlike to be and where they actually are.\n\n24\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.124\nMaybe I did that backwards.\n\n25\n00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:48.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The idea being,\n\n26\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.710\nfor instance, an organization\nI'm working with right now.\n\n27\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.450\nThey don't really understand\nwhere they are, but\n\n28\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.860\nthey know where they'd like to be.\n\n29\n00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.550\nSo we're doing a gap analysis to find\nout where in there information system\n\n30\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.770\nan acquisition, development life cycle,\netc., that they may have gaps.\n\n31\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.650\nIt's a very large shop that develops a lot\nof applications, and they wanna make sure\n\n32\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.410\nthat they're doing the best that they\ncan in ensuring that the applications\n\n33\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.060\nnot only meet their customer needs but are\ndeveloped in a timely manner, etc., etc.\n\n34\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.729\nSo I've been asked to come in and\ndo a gap analysis.\n\n35\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.600\nAnd explain to them the things that\nI uncover during my gap analysis.\n\n36\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.480\nMy gap analysis could also\nbe thought of as an audit\n\n37\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.080\nin the sense that I'm actually looking\nat what they say they wanna be doing or\n\n38\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.860\nwhat they are attempting to do and\nwhat they are actually accomplishing.\n\n39\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.905\nSo again, we're doing some reconnaissance.\n\n40\n00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:46.630\nWe're asking a lot a very\nhard questions to find out\n\n41\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.400\nwhere there might be risk in\nthe process that they were unaware of.\n\n42\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.240\nAnd the reason for that again,\nis not to make it personal or\n\n43\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.650\nnot to shoot down their products or\ntheir processes or their people.\n\n44\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.520\nBut to find areas that we can bolster\ntheir risk management practices and\n\n45\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.310\nput controls in place to ensure that the\nwork that they're doing is effective and\n\n46\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.580\nmeets the organization and the IT\ndepartment or organization's strategic and\n\n47\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.040\ntactical plans and operations, okay?\n\n48\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.650\nOne of the ways we do that is by\nconducting a vulnerability assessment.\n\n49\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.520\nAnd, helping them with\nvulnerability management.\n\n50\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.010\nAny time you're dealing with a large\nnumber of information systems,\n\n51\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.780\nyou're going to run into vulnerabilities.\n\n52\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.640\nExposed by the operating system\nby applications running on those\n\n53\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.100\noperating systems.\n\n54\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.850\nWhether that be even a mainframe\ncan have vulnerabilities exposed.\n\n55\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.170\nBut desktops, servers, and even Linux\nboxes, and yes, my favorite Apple,\n\n56\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.495\nI don't know if you're aware of it but\nApple in 2015 actually had more\n\n57\n00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:02.610\nvulnerabilities identified and\nremediated than Windows 10.\n\n58\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.730\n>> Really?\n\n59\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.826\n>> Yeah, Windows 8.1, Windows 10\nhadn't been released at that point.\n\n60\n00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:09.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They did it quicker and\n\n61\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.750\nmore efficiently than Microsoft\nhad done in the previously year,\n\n62\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.038\nbut the number was larger.\n\n63\n00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:20.280\nSo a big piece of any type\nof Software development or\n\n64\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.640\nsystem development life cycle management\ninvolves vulnerability management.\n\n65\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.720\nHow to identify vulnerabilities,\nwhat to do with them when you find them,\n\n66\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.826\nhow to risk rank them so\n\n67\n00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:39.340\nthat you're utilizing resources\nthe most effectively, etc.\n\n68\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.820\nA good example might be you're\ngetting ready to roll out,\n\n69\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.150\nthis happened to me not too long ago.\n\n70\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.870\nComing getting ready to roll out a new,\nnot\n\n71\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.430\na customer portal but a,\nthey're a co-op, and so they have\n\n72\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.540\nwhat they call members which are their\ncustomers but their not retail customers.\n\n73\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.680\nThey're wholesale customers who buy from\nthe company, they rolled out an invoice\n\n74\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.540\nmanagement system, and in that invoice\nmanagement system we discovered\n\n75\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.020\nbanking information that was not only\nnot needed, but had been inadvertently\n\n76\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.890\nloaded into the database on the back-end\nbecause it came from another source.\n\n77\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.080\nAnd the company hadn't identified that.\n\n78\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.390\nSo that was a vulnerability\nthat we discovered.\n\n79\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.020\nWe were able to remove that\ntable from the database.\n\n80\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.970\nIt wasn't being published.\n\n81\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.310\nThe users, as far as we know,\nwere never able to access it.\n\n82\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.290\nBut there was no reason for\nit to be in the database, so\n\n83\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.910\nwe removed the table completely.\n\n84\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.275\n>> Hm, very cool.\n\n85\n00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:44.403\n>> So, and when we talk about\nvulnerability management we also talk\n\n86\n00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:49.438\nabout how do you determine how\nthat happened in the first place,\n\n87\n00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:54.800\nand then how you prevent it\nfrom happening in the future.\n\n88\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.950\nHow do you build ongoing monitoring\n\n89\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.220\nto ensure that those kinds of\nthings don’t happen over and over?\n\n90\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.190\nAnd in your other applications as well.\n\n91\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.120\nSo that's part of what vulnerability\nmanagement means in the respective of\n\n92\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.080\nsystem acquisition,\ndevelopment, and management.\n\n93\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.290\nNext, we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout some SDLC tools and techniques.\n\n94\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.937\nYou'll hear me use the term SDLC\ncuz it's a lot easier than saying\n\n95\n00:06:24.937 --> 00:06:29.070\nsystem development life cycle\ncontrol management etc., etc., etc.\n\n96\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.965\nSDLC's a lot shorter.\n\n97\n00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:36.451\nThere are a number of SDLC techniques\nthat are used in application development,\n\n98\n00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:40.090\nthe first of which I wanna\ntalk about is called Agile.\n\n99\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.810\nYou don't have to know details of what\nAgile is or what it means for the exam,\n\n100\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.780\nbut it's important that you understand\nthat it is a very viable form of software\n\n101\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.560\ndevelopment model in use\ntoday in a lot of shops.\n\n102\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.760\nAgile is built around\nthe idea that traditional,\n\n103\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.509\nwhat we would have called\nwaterfall models in the past which\n\n104\n00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.430\ninvolved step B could not even\nstart until step A was completed.\n\n105\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.880\nStep C could not start until step\nB was completed which means,\n\n106\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.250\nstep C also couldn't be started\nunless A and B were both completed.\n\n107\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.630\nThat tended to drag out IT\nsoftware development projects,\n\n108\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.490\nwe found ourselves in a situation where\n\n109\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.390\ncompanies were continually missing\ndeadlines, costs were skyrocketing,\n\n110\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.730\nit was just not a really great model for\nmanaging software development.\n\n111\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.840\nSo a number of decades ago,\n\n112\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.130\nsome folks came up with the idea\nof what we would call, Agile.\n\n113\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.630\nWhich really has to do\nwith focusing more on\n\n114\n00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.960\nthe outcome of the software\ndevelopment than the process.\n\n115\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.590\nSo the customer's input and\n\n116\n00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.490\nthe user experience becomes far more\nimportant than whether or not certain\n\n117\n00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.590\ncritical functions were performed\nduring the process of development.\n\n118\n00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.113\nThat's rolled into another term we\ncall today, DevOps or development ops,\n\n119\n00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:10.908\nwhich is taking that same model,\nand rolling it into IT management.\n\n120\n00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:14.810\nOne of the activities that\nyou conduct here at ITProTV,\n\n121\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.873\nI'm not sure if you know it or not,\nthat it's part of the Agile concept,\n\n122\n00:08:19.873 --> 00:08:22.630\nis the morning meetings that you have.\n\n123\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.170\n>> Our scrum.\n\n124\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.110\n>> Yeah, your scrums.\n\n125\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.649\nThat's exactly, that's an Agile term.\n\n126\n00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.400\nWhere everyone comes in the room and\nyou very quickly go around the room and\n\n127\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.890\ntalk about what you're gonna do for\nthe day and then you get to it.\n\n128\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.100\nThere's not a lot of meetings.\n\n129\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.020\nYou don't go on and on and\n\n130\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.330\non ad nauseam about the kinds of\nthings you've been thinking about.\n\n131\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.660\nIt's what are we doing today?\n\n132\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.510\nLet's go to it.\n\n133\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.850\n>> Okay.\n>> Plain and simple, very quick.\n\n134\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.610\nThere are some pitfalls with that idea.\n\n135\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.990\nIt can be taken to extremes.\n\n136\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.790\nIf certain types of security testing or\n\n137\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.060\nsecurity mechanisms aren't built\ninto the software development\n\n138\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.440\nmechanisms properly,\nproblems can creep into the code.\n\n139\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.440\nFor instance, part of what's called\ncontinuous development has to do with\n\n140\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.440\ntesting nightly builds of codes to\nensure that they meet certain criteria.\n\n141\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.790\nSide note, this is not on the test,\nyou won't even see or\n\n142\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.280\nhear this term on the test, but there\nis something called the OWASP Top 10.\n\n143\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.847\nThe Open Web Application\nSecurity Project Top 10.\n\n144\n00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:30.030\nThose include things like SQL injection,\ncross-site scripting, etc., etc.\n\n145\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.350\nEnsuring that code is not\nsusceptible to any of those,\n\n146\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.120\nbecause they're called the top ten,\nbecause they're the ten most frequently\n\n147\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.620\nseen vulnerabilities on the Internet,\nyear after year after year, I might add.\n\n148\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.140\nThat if your code is not susceptible to\nany vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10,\n\n149\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.949\nyou're probably doing a pretty good job of\nmanaging your code and doing development.\n\n150\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.120\nAnother concept in SDLC tools and\ntechniques we talk about is prototyping.\n\n151\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.473\nAnd that's building prototypes of\napplications that you've never\n\n152\n00:10:01.473 --> 00:10:02.410\nbuilt before.\n\n153\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.950\nYou have no idea whether they're going\nto work but you gotta try something, so\n\n154\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.880\nyou prototype them.\n\n155\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.830\nThat's where you'll see\nvery quick revisions.\n\n156\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.460\nThe oldest example I can think of,\nthis is with Windows.\n\n157\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.212\nMost people may remember Windows 3 or\nWindows 3.1.\n\n158\n00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:22.850\nBut very few people have ever\nseen Windows 1 or Windows 2.\n\n159\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.290\nThere was a Windows 1 and\na Windows 2 version.\n\n160\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.830\nVery few people have ever seen it.\n\n161\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.521\n>> I have not.\n\n162\n00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:31.178\n>> And Windows 3 and 3.1 and\n3.5 stayed around not very long.\n\n163\n00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:34.530\n3.5 in particular was very short-lived.\n\n164\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.867\nBut those were the testbeds before,\nI don't think 1 or\n\n165\n00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:41.428\n2 were ever actually released\nto the public for purchase.\n\n166\n00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:45.760\nI believe 3.0 was the very first\nversion of Windows ever released,\n\n167\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.040\nthat I'm aware of.\n\n168\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.100\nThere's another one called\nrapid application development.\n\n169\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.200\nThat's another model that you used.\n\n170\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.510\nIt's very similar to Agile and\n\n171\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.915\nthat is designed for\nrapid application development.\n\n172\n00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:02.925\nIt is the idea that we want to\nvery quickly move through modules,\n\n173\n00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:06.495\nto get to where we need to go, and\nwe'll worry about security, and\n\n174\n00:11:06.495 --> 00:11:08.955\nthe process on the back-end of all that.\n\n175\n00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:13.995\nAgain, I think you can see,\nthat these kind of models tend to\n\n176\n00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:19.390\nhave the propensity to\nintroduce vulnerabilities\n\n177\n00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.570\nbecause we're sometimes moving faster\nwith function than we are with security.\n\n178\n00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.020\nMy goal, my hope is some day we'll\nbe able to marry the two of those.\n\n179\n00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.700\nI don't think they're incongruent, but\n\n180\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.600\na lot of coding people don't\nseem to care about that.\n\n181\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.530\nOr aren't willing to invest in\nlearning about how to change that.\n\n182\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.510\nTheir process and security people\nhave a tendency historically to kinda\n\n183\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.680\nstomp their feet and\nnot want to work with developers either.\n\n184\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.590\nI think there's a way we can find\nsome happy ground with that.\n\n185\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:58.780\nAnd in those lines, are what\nare called secure coding practices.\n\n186\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.630\nMore and more you are starting to see,\nI don't know if it happens\n\n187\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.790\nat New Horizons here, but more and\nmore around the country I am seeing\n\n188\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.500\ncourses on secure coding practices\nbeing deployed in colleges and\n\n189\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.650\nuniversities it is just beginning\nto creep into the curriculum.\n\n190\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.710\nMore training facilities like this.\n\n191\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.666\nWhere you're seeing more and\nmore secure coding practice classes.\n\n192\n00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:26.130\nSo that we develop applications from\nthe ground up, thinking that well,\n\n193\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:31.098\nif I'm gonna create a form field, then the\nfirst thing I need to do is to ensure that\n\n194\n00:12:31.098 --> 00:12:35.490\nI've instructed the application to\nonly accept certain kinds of data,\n\n195\n00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.449\ncertain length strings, etc., etc., etc.\n\n196\n00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:39.775\nSo that those aren't vulnerable.\n>> There's validation in there.\n\n197\n00:12:39.775 --> 00:12:42.360\n>> Yeah, exactly so\nthat they aren't vulnerable later on.\n\n198\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.750\nRather than just creating them on\nthe fly and worrying about it later,\n\n199\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.523\nbecause we all know that those\nkind of vulnerabilities.\n\n200\n00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:49.361\n>> Later never comes.\n\n201\n00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:51.880\n>> Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n202\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.420\nSo we're seeing more and\nmore secure coding practices being\n\n203\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.330\nbaked into the the culture\nin coding environments, but\n\n204\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.480\nit's still not as widespread\nas I'd like to see it.\n\n205\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.670\n>> Right.\n\n206\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.360\n>> And then the last piece I wanna\ntalk about, sort of ties together with\n\n207\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.370\na couple of these and that has to do\nwith system version control systems.\n\n208\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:21.030\nSo things like Git,\nI can't remember what Microsoft changed,\n\n209\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.710\nit used to be called\nthe team something server.\n\n210\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.830\n>> GitHub or?\n\n211\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.740\n>> GitHub was one but\nthe Microsoft product were code where\n\n212\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.510\nyour code repositories, team server\nI think is what it was called but\n\n213\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.350\nthey change it about every year or\nevery two years something like that.\n\n214\n00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.980\nBut basically the idea is\nthat you check code in and\n\n215\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.220\nout as it's developed,\nmuch like you would a document.\n\n216\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.140\nBecause you may have three different\ncoders or a dozen different coders working\n\n217\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.930\non the same software but on different\nmodules and you wanna ensure that you have\n\n218\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.010\ncorrect code versioning so\nthat you don't break some functionality.\n\n219\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.640\nWhere this becomes really important is,\nI see this I don't\n\n220\n00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.360\nsee it directly anymore because most of\nthis has moved up to cloud providers.\n\n221\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.290\nBut in days gone by,\nwhen banks still used mainframes for\n\n222\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.580\nconducting their transactions in-house,\nthey would typically buy a mainframe or\n\n223\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.460\nthey will lease it from IBM or\nHP, something like that.\n\n224\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.830\nAnd then IBM or HP will take care of\nthe software for them anytime there were\n\n225\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:28.370\nsoftware changes which were very,\nvery rare and coming, they\n\n226\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.620\nwould come with very specific instructions\non how the code was to be upgraded.\n\n227\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.370\nAnd it was pretty much built\nin that you couldn't break it.\n\n228\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.900\nIt was, you push this tape in and\nleave it alone.\n\n229\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.100\nThe coders had already\ndesigned it to install itself.\n\n230\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.940\nYou couldn't mess anything up.\n\n231\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.376\nAnd generally the changes were very small.\n\n232\n00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:56.237\nIt was very rare that they would\nactually change any of their code.\n\n233\n00:14:56.237 --> 00:15:00.696\nSort of the one of the standing\ntestimonials to mainframes is that their\n\n234\n00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:02.650\ncode is so rock solid.\n\n235\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.769\nThat we run our banking transactions\nall over the country and\n\n236\n00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:10.890\nacross the world on mainframes\ntoday that were still running\n\n237\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.543\ncode that was written in COBOL 50 or\n60 years ago.\n\n238\n00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:15.705\n>> That is impressive.\n\n239\n00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:17.345\n>> It's extremely reliable.\n\n240\n00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:18.559\nIt's extremely resilient.\n\n241\n00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:22.601\nIt's almost no one understands the code\nanymore, so in terms of hacking it's\n\n242\n00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:26.091\nnothing like a web page where you\nmight be able to do a SQL injection or\n\n243\n00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.495\nsomething like that.\n\n244\n00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:29.705\nIt's really, really robust.\n\n245\n00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:36.810\nIt's extremely fast, can handle millions\nand millions of transactions in real time.\n\n246\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.530\nAnd it's also extremely secure.\n\n247\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.850\nIt's been tested decade after decade.\n\n248\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.330\nThose early mainframes were all built\non Department of Defense models, so,\n\n249\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.725\nthe code and the architecture,\nthe hardware architecture,\n\n250\n00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:54.572\netc., was built from the ground up to be\nreliable, resilient and secure, all three.\n\n251\n00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:55.568\n>> Wow, nice.\n\n252\n00:15:55.568 --> 00:16:00.283\n>> So, that pretty much wraps it up for\nthe first session of the software\n\n253\n00:16:00.283 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and\n\n4\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.540\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our series of the CISA.\n\n5\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.830\nThat's right we've got this\nlovely book right here for\n\n6\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.590\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.980\nAnd guess what with me\ntoday is our SME Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.020\nBrian O'Hare who is actually one\nof the authors of this here book.\n\n9\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.200\nBrian welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.680\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.480\n>> Good, thanks Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.460\nThanks for having me on again.\n\n13\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.040\nWe're going to pick up were we\nleft off in the last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.807\nThis is part three of domain three,\nInformation Systems Acquisition,\n\n15\n00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:48.810\nDevelopment and Implementations.\n\n16\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.640\n>> It's a bit of a mouth full.\n\n17\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.080\n>> Quite a mouth full to talk about.\n\n18\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.580\nWe have quite a bit of\ninformation to cover.\n\n19\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.610\nSo I wanna get started this morning.\n\n20\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.490\nYesterday, or in the previous session,\nexcuse me, we talked a little bit about\n\n21\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.790\nreturn on investment, and\ntotal cost of ownership for\n\n22\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.220\nprojects of acquiring systems,\ndeveloping them, and implementing them.\n\n23\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.920\nToday I'd like to talk a little\nbit more deeply about that.\n\n24\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.490\nIn terms of, what are the actual\nsteps involved for an auditor or for\n\n25\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.780\nan auditor to review in terms of\nwhat an organization is doing and\n\n26\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.770\nhow they acquire systems and how they\nhandle the lifecycle of those systems.\n\n27\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.310\nAgain, just for review,\n\n28\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.620\nwhen we talk about systems we're really\ntalking about software, hardware,\n\n29\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.640\nfirmware, and human resources, the people\nthat it takes to run those systems.\n\n30\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.100\nSo for instance, mainframes require\na lot of tender loving care, TLC.\n\n31\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.430\nIf any of you have ever worked\nin a mainframe environment,\n\n32\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.110\nyou know that they're very, very powerful,\nbut very, very sensitive systems.\n\n33\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.840\nThey do not take kindly\nto being messed with.\n\n34\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.060\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout project management again.\n\n35\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.535\nThis will be the second or the third time\nthat that's come up in the series because\n\n36\n00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:09.760\n[INAUDIBLE] places a great bit of\nvalue and information on project\n\n37\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.400\nmanagement throughout the five domains and\nthrough the materials we talk about.\n\n38\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.610\nBecause they part of our role as\nauditors is auditing the project\n\n39\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.890\nmanagement function of IT departments when\nwe go in and we look either from inside\n\n40\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.820\nan internal audit department or\ncoming in as an external auditor.\n\n41\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.850\nPart of our responsibilities include\nbeing able to evaluate assess and\n\n42\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.240\nmake recommendations, or come up with\nfindings about how those processes work.\n\n43\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.220\nAre they effective?\n\n44\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.930\nRemember in one of the previous\nepisodes we talked about\n\n45\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.920\nkey performance indicators.\n\n46\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.720\nSo are projects happening on time,\nand on budget?\n\n47\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.900\nOr are they coming in late constantly and\n\n48\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310\nover budget, which is kind of typical for\nIT in a lot of organizations.\n\n49\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.890\nI'm sure you've never seen\nthat before have you?\n\n50\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.495\n>> Never, never.\n\n51\n00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:06.040\n>> [LAUGH] So, what I want to do is\nI'd like to bring up a graphic here.\n\n52\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.720\nWe'll start with just\nthe top part of this.\n\n53\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990\nI think we have it on the screen there.\n\n54\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.140\nI'm don't know if I need to\nblow that up any more or not.\n\n55\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.690\nDo I, Daniel?\n\n56\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.100\nDo you think that's good enough for folks?\n\n57\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.190\nYeah, let's take it to about right, right\nthere, cuz we're only gonna be reviewing.\n\n58\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.560\nRight now, we're only gonna be\nreviewing the first part of that.\n\n59\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.850\nAnd then I'm gonna talk about\na couple of key terms in the book,\n\n60\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.190\nas well as in the ISACA\nstudy materials you\n\n61\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.440\nshould know by now that there are both\nknowledge statements and task statements\n\n62\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.680\nthat ISACA has laid out very clearly\nto ensure that the CSI understands.\n\n63\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.010\nWe're gonna go over a couple\nof those terms this morning.\n\n64\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.200\nThe first being request for\nproposal or RFP.\n\n65\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.950\nIf you haven't ever heard of those before,\nyou need to read up a little bit about it.\n\n66\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.500\nYou can go online to Google,\n\n67\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.030\nand you can find more RFPs than you can\nshake a stick at, in 30 seconds or less.\n\n68\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.310\nSo you get a feel for\nwhat a request for proposal looks like.\n\n69\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.360\nThe really difficult part is figuring\nout how those are written, and\n\n70\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.180\nhow they're put together.\n\n71\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.780\nIf you've never written an RFP,\nit's quite a bit of work and\n\n72\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.690\nthat's part of what I\nwanna talk about here.\n\n73\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.270\n>> Brian, are they standardized in any\nway or is it basically just any kind of,\n\n74\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.530\nas long as it is in some\nsort of formal write up or\n\n75\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.170\ndo you need to follow this procedure?\n\n76\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.380\n>> Well, there are a lot of different\nformats out there that you will see and\n\n77\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.270\nyou'll run across\n>> We're gonna talk specifically about\n\n78\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.740\nthe steps involved that recommends.\n\n79\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.680\nAnd that they've shown, that we're\ngonna talk about in this graphic.\n\n80\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.770\nSo they should follow this\ngeneral guideline but\n\n81\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.430\nI've seen them all over the place.\n\n82\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.890\nWhat it really boils down to\nif you look at it from a,\n\n83\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.170\nthere's two ways to approach it.\n\n84\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.120\nOne is from the check box view, which\nis did it meet all these requirements\n\n85\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.480\nthat you see here on the screen, or\nnumber two, did it get the job done?\n\n86\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.960\nAnd as an auditor, I think what you'll\nfind over time is that there's a balance\n\n87\n00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.040\nbetween the two of those that you need to\nfind, and that any organization needs to\n\n88\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.940\nfind when writing this, so that It's\nnot only, tries to meet all of these,\n\n89\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.410\nall of these steps, but\nalso meets the requirements and gets done.\n\n90\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd is in line with what\nthe organization needs and\n\n91\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.190\nis in alignment with our strategy,\nthe overall idea and company strategy.\n\n92\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.350\nSo, the first step\nbefore you even begin to\n\n93\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.780\nwrite an RFP is to define\nyour requirements.\n\n94\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.450\nYou'll see that in phase\ntwo on the screen.\n\n95\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.900\nI don't think I can, yeah,\nthere I can highlight that.\n\n96\n00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.550\nPhase two requirement's definition, that's\nmore challenging than you might think,\n\n97\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.850\nbecause when you sit down to the table and\nyou start talking to all the people\n\n98\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.380\ninvolved with purchasing a new system or\nacquiring a new system of some type.\n\n99\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.410\nMaybe you want to look at implementing\na virtual desktop environment.\n\n100\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.230\nBDIs, or\nmaybe you want to buy a new firewall.\n\n101\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.030\nThose sound like great ideas,\n\n102\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.370\nbut those can be very expensive\npropositions in large companies.\n\n103\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.270\nYou have to have very clear requirement\ndefinitions in order to be able to get\n\n104\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.260\nyour stakeholders to buy into that.\n\n105\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.730\nOtherwise, they're going to say,\nthis is crazy,\n\n106\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.680\nyou just want to spend a bunch of money.\n\n107\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.550\nSo writing you requirements\nin the definitions for\n\n108\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.240\nwhat you're trying to accomplish\nis really very important.\n\n109\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.960\nThe feasibility study, which Isaka\npoints out, that comes before that.\n\n110\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.820\nI'm not sure I can get\nthat one to highlight.\n\n111\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.790\nThere we go, how's that?\n\n112\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.920\nThe feasibility study really\nis sort of a quick and\n\n113\n00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.740\ndirty look at is this something we can\nactually do, do we have the resources.\n\n114\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.238\nNecessary to do this, if we could put our\nrequirements definition together or not.\n\n115\n00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:50.480\nThen after requirements\ndefinitions are completed,\n\n116\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.850\nthere's a review process that happens.\n\n117\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.080\nAnd the review process should be\ndone in an environment where you've,\n\n118\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.990\nagain, separated.\n\n119\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.147\nWe talked yesterday for\nthe first time about separation of duties.\n\n120\n00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:06.175\nIf you think about it,\nit doesn't make good sense for\n\n121\n00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:10.632\nan organization to have the guys who want\nthe firewall to review the proposal.\n\n122\n00:07:10.632 --> 00:07:11.937\n>> Might be a little\nconflict of interest there.\n\n123\n00:07:11.937 --> 00:07:16.807\n>> Exactly, exactly, you want that\nreviewed by somebody else who doesn't have\n\n124\n00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:20.730\ninvested interest in the outcome but\n>> You also wanna make sure that\n\n125\n00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.160\nit's not being reviewed and\nsigned off by people who are trying to\n\n126\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.480\ncut costs, or who don't have\nthe company's interests in mind,\n\n127\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.770\nor whose efforts don't align\nwith the business strategy or\n\n128\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.570\nthe IT strategy which should also\nalign with the business strategy.\n\n129\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.790\n>> So Brian is this usually done\nby a third party that has no\n\n130\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.460\nvested interest, or\n>> Do they typically use some sort of in\n\n131\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.370\nhouse, set of people that okay we\ntrust them to do this correctly?\n\n132\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.493\n>> Yeah, generally it's done\nby the IT steering committee,\n\n133\n00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:52.198\nwhich we talked about in\nthe previous episode.\n\n134\n00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:56.460\nGenerally the IT steering committee,\ndoes the review, because the IT steering\n\n135\n00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.596\ncommittee, we didn't get into the real\nmeat and details of it yesterday, but\n\n136\n00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:04.545\ntypically consists and that there\nare pictures in a book that you can look,\n\n137\n00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:08.138\ngraphs in the book that show\nthe The organizational design of that.\n\n138\n00:08:08.138 --> 00:08:11.310\nBut, the steering committee\ntypically consists of\n\n139\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.880\nsenior level managers from all\nthe different competing departments.\n\n140\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.510\nHR, IT, Operations,\nthe CFO could be involved.\n\n141\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.790\nLots of different people.\n\n142\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:28.590\nWe talked yesterday too, about the fact\nthat those committees can be very\n\n143\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.390\nconvoluted at times because in smaller\norganizations people wear multiple hats.\n\n144\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.760\nThat makes it a little tougher.\n\n145\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.570\nThe bigger the organization the more\nyou can sort of spread the love\n\n146\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.275\naround, as we say.\n\n147\n00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:43.347\nThen hopefully any sort\n\n148\n00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:47.720\nof political agenda or financial agendas\nwill get watered down by the fact that\n\n149\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.550\nthere are enough people involved that\nyou will get a decent review done.\n\n150\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.190\nAt that point you choose to buy or\nbuild a system, plain and simple.\n\n151\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.600\nIn house, out of house,\ncloud based, internally based.\n\n152\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.440\nAll those kind of decisions get made.\n\n153\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.240\nAnd I wanna kinda stop at that point,\n\n154\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.510\nI don't think we have any questions\ncoming in, but I want to drop out of\n\n155\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.720\nthis diagram, we'll come back\nto this in just a little bit.\n\n156\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.650\nOkay.\n\n157\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.500\nWe'll come back around because I\nwant to talk a little bit about\n\n158\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.630\nproject management, the project portfolio.\n\n159\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.340\n>> Project management,\nit's always a fun, fun topic.\n\n160\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.700\n>> Yeah.\n>> I did the project plus course with\n\n161\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.020\nRonnie so I, it's a lot of detail,\n\n162\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.660\na lot of thinking in terms that you\nprobably never thought you'd think in.\n\n163\n00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.680\nThat's all I took from it.\n\n164\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.350\n>> A lot of detail.\n\n165\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's all you need to say.\n\n166\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.180\n>> Yes.\n>> It's a lot of detail.\n\n167\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:52.000\nIn Isaka, Isaka feels\n\n168\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.170\nthat project management is not only a very\nresponsibility of auditors, but it's\n\n169\n00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.390\na fair amount of material across all five\ndomains you'll hear it talked about it.\n\n170\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:06.245\nBut in this particular context of this\ndomain we're talking about projects and\n\n171\n00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:10.957\nthe project portfolio for information\nsystems acquisition development and\n\n172\n00:10:10.957 --> 00:10:12.130\nimplementation.\n\n173\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.892\nSo what they're really talking\nabout is how are projects managed.\n\n174\n00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:19.402\nWhat's the difference,\nyou'll need to know this,\n\n175\n00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:23.810\nyou'll need to know the difference between\na project and a project portfolio.\n\n176\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.640\nIt seems like it should make common sense,\nbut not everyone gets that.\n\n177\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.540\nYour project portfolio is\nyour collection of projects.\n\n178\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.340\nYour project is a specific item\nthat you may be implementing.\n\n179\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.860\nSo as a project manager or\n\n180\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:46.000\na PMO office may have multiple project\nportfolios in different departments.\n\n181\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.670\nMaybe they have one for accounting,\nmaybe they have one for IT,\n\n182\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.680\nmaybe they have one for security.\n\n183\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.290\nThey may be split up like that.\n\n184\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.680\nAnd then each of those portfolios\nhas projects inside of those.\n\n185\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.590\nAnd the PMO office has responsibility for\nthe entire collection of those.\n\n186\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.220\nSo, it's very important\nthat as a CISA candidate,\n\n187\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.040\nthat you understand the workings of all\nthat because it becomes very important.\n\n188\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.770\nBecause one of the things,\nexcuse me, that we want to audit and\n\n189\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.930\nshare with our auditees if you will,\nthat a new term for you, auditee.\n\n190\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.010\n>> That's right auditee.\n\n191\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.160\n>> Is the effectiveness of their projects.\n\n192\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.120\nAgain, are they being\ncompleted in a timely manner,\n\n193\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.040\nare they coming in under budget and\nmost importantly are they effective.\n\n194\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.780\nAre they actually accomplishing\nwhat the requirement definitions\n\n195\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.690\nstated in the initial part of\nthe project development life cycle,\n\n196\n00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.220\nwhich is part of what we're talking about.\n\n197\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.720\nAnd then the very\n\n198\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.700\nlast part of that life cycle in project\nmanagement Is the evaluation in review and\n\n199\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.170\nin fact there's a particular term, program\nevaluation in review technique,PERT,\n\n200\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.320\nyou'll find more information in the book\non that, and you should be familiar with,\n\n201\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.650\nwhich is just a technique used in\nthe planning and control system projects.\n\n202\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.800\nThat helps you, again,\n\n203\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.070\nmake sure that you're on top of what's\nhappening inside the organization.\n\n204\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.540\nYou also probably become familiar with\nthese terms if you're working for\n\n205\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.490\nan audit firm, because each of their\naudits are considered a project.\n\n206\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.850\nThey have a project management office and\n\n207\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.950\nthose offices have multiple project\nportfolios occurring at any given time.\n\n208\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.300\nFor instance, if I can say this, a PWC for\n\n209\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.290\ninstance, might have a bank as a customer,\nand they might be doing a financial audit,\n\n210\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.240\nan IT general controls audit,\nthey might be doing a PCI audit, and\n\n211\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.630\nthey might be doing several other\nsub audits, like a GLBA audit, or\n\n212\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.700\na I'm blanking on the name\nof it; I'll come back to it.\n\n213\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.540\nThere's a number of specific\nregulatory audits that have to be done\n\n214\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:03.120\non a regular basis in banking, so\neach of those is a separate project.\n\n215\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.540\nThose all fit into that\nbank's project portfolio,\n\n216\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.820\nthen the PMO may have multiple\nbanks that they're dealing with.\n\n217\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.284\nThe same can be true of\nhealthcare organizations,\n\n218\n00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:15.299\nas we talked about In previous episodes.\n\n219\n00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:19.793\nHealth care organizations not\nonly are often times required\n\n220\n00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:23.669\nto comply with HIPAA regulations,\nbut also PCI, or\n\n221\n00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:28.163\nPayment Card Industry Council regulations,\nor excuse me,\n\n222\n00:13:28.163 --> 00:13:33.187\ncontractual obligations,\nsimply because they use credit cards to\n\n223\n00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:38.497\ntake copayments to pay hospital bills,\npay for prescriptions, etc.\n\n224\n00:13:38.497 --> 00:13:41.817\nSo they have to be both PCI compliant and\nHIPAA comliant.\n\n225\n00:13:41.817 --> 00:13:49.730\nSo understanding that whole project\nmanagement terminology is very important.\n\n226\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.810\nIt's important on the exam,\nit's important as part of your\n\n227\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.320\njob duties as a CIC auditor.\n\n228\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:06.330\nSo, next, I wanna talk a little\nbit about regulatory requirements.\n\n229\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.310\nI wanna go back to that.\n\n230\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.550\nWe talked about it in\na previous session yesterday,\n\n231\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.789\nand then we'll finish up with the rest of\nthis lifecycle and wrap it up for the day.\n\n232\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:22.370\nWe talked briefly about PCI not\nbeing a regulatory requirement.\n\n233\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.350\nPayment Card Industry Council, that's\nactually a contractual agreement between\n\n234\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:32.210\na credit card processor and a vendor\nwho accepts credit cards for payments.\n\n235\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:38.685\nThere's no law regarding payment\ncard security or security standards.\n\n236\n00:14:38.685 --> 00:14:44.150\nHIPAA, the Health Information Portability\nand Affordability Act,\n\n237\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.270\nis a federal requirement,\nfederal law, federal requirements.\n\n238\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:54.250\nFDIC, excuse me, GLBA Is a law and\na federal requirement.\n\n239\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.090\nThe FDIC enforces those requirements.\n\n240\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.930\nThe FFIC promulgates regulations\naround those requirements.\n\n241\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.120\nSo, it's important that you\nunderstand the difference between\n\n242\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.729\nregulatory requirements and\ncontractual requirements.\n\n243\n00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.920\nAgain we have talked about\nthose several times.\n\n244\n00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.660\n>> When we speak of\nregulatory requirements,\n\n245\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.820\nare we always looking at something\nthat is federally imposed, but\n\n246\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.630\nfor the power of the sword,\nmade sure that you are following them?\n\n247\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.490\n>> Good question, generally that's\nwhat we're speaking about but\n\n248\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.080\nthe way it works in\nthe real world is that.\n\n249\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.660\nState laws, generally are superseded by\nfederal, unless they're more stringent.\n\n250\n00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.841\nSo, in some states for\ninstance, Massachusetts,\n\n251\n00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:45.067\nif you are a Massachusetts resident,\nand you are in California,\n\n252\n00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:49.627\nand your credit card is breached\nby a California vendor,\n\n253\n00:15:49.627 --> 00:15:54.108\nyou're required by Massachusetts\nlaw to be notified.\n\n254\n00:15:54.108 --> 00:15:58.447\nSo there are some states where\nthe laws are more, well in PCI in\n\n255\n00:15:58.447 --> 00:16:03.468\nparticular there is a law for\nthat where in other states there aren't.\n\n256\n00:16:03.468 --> 00:16:08.530\nSo there's some cross state stuff, it\ndepends on whatever's the more stringent.\n\n257\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.580\nMost states do not have laws more\nstringent than the federal government,\n\n258\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.120\nbecause it then puts a tax\nburden on the states rather\n\n259\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.560\nthan on the federal government.\n\n260\n00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.218\nSo most of the time that's not the case,\nbut good question.\n\n261\n00:16:20.218 --> 00:16:26.295\nSo now if I can bring back up the diagram\nthat we were looking at earlier,\n\n262\n00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:27.424\nthere we go.\n\n263\n00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:34.817\nAnd talk a little bit about, I'm gonna\nzoom this up and we'll talk about.\n\n264\n00:16:34.817 --> 00:16:36.573\nThere, how about that?\n\n265\n00:16:36.573 --> 00:16:39.933\nGive me just one second and\n\n266\n00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:44.375\nI guess I can't scroll it, can I?\n\n267\n00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.172\nI don't want to give you\na headache looking at that.\n\n268\n00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:52.513\nSo, now we're talking about\nsystem development lifecycle.\n\n269\n00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.649\nSDLC, you'll hear that term a lot.\n\n270\n00:16:54.649 --> 00:17:01.356\nIt also, you also hear the term\nin software development circles\n\n271\n00:17:01.356 --> 00:17:06.957\nthat referred to a software\ndevelopment lifecycle.\n\n272\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.675\nSoftware is a system component.\n\n273\n00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:17.084\nRemember, when we talked in previous\nepisodes, systems involve software,\n\n274\n00:17:17.084 --> 00:17:20.303\nhardware, firmware,\nhuman resources, everything.\n\n275\n00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:22.000\nSo, software is a form of system.\n\n276\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.900\nIn this environment, we talk about all\nthose kind of lump them all together.\n\n277\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.384\nSo, we've gone through our\nrequirements definition.\n\n278\n00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.788\nWe've reviewed them.\n\n279\n00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:38.889\nWe've decided to choose buy or\nbuild and you can see from the diagram,\n\n280\n00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:44.810\nthat decision drives two different paths\nthrough completion of the lifecycle.\n\n281\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.678\nOne is either system selection or system\ndesign, whether you're gonna build it or\n\n282\n00:17:48.678 --> 00:17:49.462\nbuy it in house.\n\n283\n00:17:49.462 --> 00:17:54.451\nWhat they don't present in here, which\nI find is interesting is what's really\n\n284\n00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:58.910\nimportant today from both from\nan audit and security position.\n\n285\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.060\nAre those systems hosted internally or\nexternally?\n\n286\n00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.200\nAre they cloud based or internal based?\n\n287\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.762\nBut that's not important for\nthe exam purposes for this course.\n\n288\n00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:13.340\nSo now, let's assume that you've\nmade your system selection.\n\n289\n00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.764\nThere is one more review process to make\nsure you've got what you've asked for,\n\n290\n00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:24.268\nbecause heaven forbid a vendor sent you\nsomething you didn't or make you promises\n\n291\n00:18:24.268 --> 00:18:29.155\nin your choose and your RFP statement\nthat aren't actually fulfilled.\n\n292\n00:18:29.155 --> 00:18:30.092\n>> Yeah, that wouldn't be good.\n\n293\n00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:31.390\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.467\n>> So, you receive brand new servers and\n\n295\n00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:38.998\nthey don't meet the specifications\nthat you laid out.\n\n296\n00:18:38.998 --> 00:18:42.500\nAnd the vendor says, well, I'm really\nsorry, but we must have misunderstood.\n\n297\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.495\n>> Makes you feel like you're working one\nof those like back alley guys that sells\n\n298\n00:18:46.495 --> 00:18:47.896\nstuff out of his van going.\n\n299\n00:18:47.896 --> 00:18:50.176\nHey, I got these great servers for\nyou and you take it home and\n\n300\n00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:53.060\nthere's no hard drives in them,\nno processors or something.\n\n301\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.567\n>> Well, it happens in that they sometimes\nvendors will make claims that aren't true,\n\n302\n00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:01.635\nespecially when it comes\nto a hardware vendor.\n\n303\n00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:04.375\nWho makes claims about what software\nwill do on their systems and\n\n304\n00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:07.774\nthen you load the software that does not\nperform the way that the hardware vendor\n\n305\n00:19:07.774 --> 00:19:08.650\npromised it would.\n\n306\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.927\nAnd then the finger pointing begins,\nbut all this results in delays.\n\n307\n00:19:12.927 --> 00:19:17.440\nSo, you start running over budget and\nbehind your time lines.\n\n308\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.816\nSo, it's very important\nthat the organization.\n\n309\n00:19:20.816 --> 00:19:25.268\nOur role in this as a CIA,\nlet say, auditor is to ensure that\n\n310\n00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:30.438\nthe organization is following procedures,\nso that projects don't\n\n311\n00:19:30.438 --> 00:19:35.850\nget behind their time line, so\nthat projects come in under budget.\n\n312\n00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.656\nBut most importantly is those\nthings can also introduce risk and\n\n313\n00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:44.928\nour primary job is to help\nthe organization manage risk to\n\n314\n00:19:44.928 --> 00:19:48.488\nthe levels we discussed\nin previous episodes,\n\n315\n00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:54.201\nwhich are within what we call their\nrisk tolerance or risk appetite course.\n\n316\n00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:57.400\nSo, that's really what\nthe review process is about.\n\n317\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.921\nThen we move onto phase five,\nwhich is the implementation,\n\n318\n00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:03.766\nwhich is when the servers,\nthe software, etc.\n\n319\n00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:06.970\nActually go into full production.\n\n320\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.850\nDuring that production, let me pull\nthat right back out a little bit.\n\n321\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.787\nThere we go.\n\n322\n00:20:11.787 --> 00:20:15.485\nThroughout the lifecycle\nof that implementation,\n\n323\n00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:20.274\nthere should be ongoing reviews to\nensure that the completeness and\n\n324\n00:20:20.274 --> 00:20:24.240\naccuracy of all\nthe transactions is occurring.\n\n325\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.824\nI'm sure, Daniel,\nyou work with SQL all the time.\n\n326\n00:20:26.824 --> 00:20:31.600\nWe've talked several times in\nthis series about auditors\n\n327\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.450\nare very much like the SQL,\nshoot I forget what it's called now.\n\n328\n00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.874\nThe transactional log process in that\nour job is to ensure that everything\n\n329\n00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:47.786\nhappens the way it should happen\nbefore it gets written to the log.\n\n330\n00:20:47.786 --> 00:20:51.690\nAnd once it's written to the log, it's\nthen auditable from that point forward.\n\n331\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.262\nIf it doesn't happen the way,\nit should it gets backed out.\n\n332\n00:20:54.262 --> 00:20:57.296\nAnd that's part of what\nwe look at in systems is,\n\n333\n00:20:57.296 --> 00:21:00.330\nare those transactions complete and\naccurate?\n\n334\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.232\nAnd if they're not,\n\n335\n00:21:01.232 --> 00:21:03.851\nwe have a major problem that\nintroduces risk into the system.\n\n336\n00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:06.238\n>> Because you go back and can't evaluate.\n\n337\n00:21:06.238 --> 00:21:08.760\n>> You can't rely on the transactions,\nwe do that.\n\n338\n00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.990\nIt's not so much done by external auditors\nanymore, but there are still some software\n\n339\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:19.890\nauditors out there who will do that kind\nof stage testing for mainframe software.\n\n340\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.194\nA lot of the stuff that banks use,\nbecause they're so\n\n341\n00:21:23.194 --> 00:21:27.896\nmuch at risk that that software has to\nbe absolutely rock solid and tested and\n\n342\n00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:31.937\nverified by multiple external\nsources before they are allowed to\n\n343\n00:21:31.937 --> 00:21:36.291\ngo into production, because of\nthe risk of a transaction going sour.\n\n344\n00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:42.143\nSo now we are getting into, again, part\nof what we are talking about is a system\n\n345\n00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:48.355\ndevelopment lifecycle all the way from\nthe feasibility study clear up to reviews,\n\n346\n00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:53.330\nchoosing, building, deploying,\nimplementing systems.\n\n347\n00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.530\nNow we're at the point of\npost-implementation, which is okay,\n\n348\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.656\nnow we have to start thinking about\nhow the system served us well?\n\n349\n00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:03.410\nWhat do we need to do next?\n\n350\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.854\nSo let's fast forward five years,\nour servers are beginning to age.\n\n351\n00:22:07.854 --> 00:22:11.610\nThe hard drives are getting harder\nto find, they're wearing out.\n\n352\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.851\nWe need more RAM.\n\n353\n00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:16.060\nThe applications\nare requiring more resources.\n\n354\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.079\nProcessors are now able to do more, etc.\n\n355\n00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:21.791\nThe RAM's faster than it used to be,\n\n356\n00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:24.920\nwe're moving to flash drives\ninstead of spinning drives.\n\n357\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.315\nAll those things change that give us,\nagain,\n\n358\n00:22:28.315 --> 00:22:32.679\nmore opportunities, but\nwith those come increased risk.\n\n359\n00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:35.740\nWe have to go through\nthis whole cycle again.\n\n360\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.805\nOnce we begin to bring new systems\nonline to replace the old ones,\n\n361\n00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:46.329\nthen the part that nobody wants to talk\nabout or deal with is disposal and\n\n362\n00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:50.959\nthat is kind of like,\nmaybe this is not a good example.\n\n363\n00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:56.870\nBut when we die,\nwe don't deal with that very well.\n\n364\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.598\nNo one does.\n\n365\n00:22:58.598 --> 00:22:59.759\nIt's a very difficult.\n\n366\n00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:01.700\nIt's a messy process.\n\n367\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.120\nIt's not easy for anyone.\n\n368\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.630\nIt's always wrought with problems.\n\n369\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.490\nWell, disposal information\nsystems is the same way.\n\n370\n00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.905\nYou have to think about where what kind of\ndata might be still tied to that system.\n\n371\n00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:19.740\nIf it goes offline, can we still do\nall the things that we need to do?\n\n372\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.138\nIs there something we forgot?\n\n373\n00:23:21.138 --> 00:23:26.430\nAnd if so, can we spit it back up\nbefore we completely destroy it?\n\n374\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:32.384\nOne of the things that is very common\ntoday is to encrypt hard drives,\n\n375\n00:23:32.384 --> 00:23:39.689\nfor instance, to prevent against theft and\nwe have to manage the keys that are used.\n\n376\n00:23:39.689 --> 00:23:42.879\nI don't wanna get into a full discussion\nof encryption at this point, but\n\n377\n00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:44.170\nwe have to manage those keys.\n\n378\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.716\nWell, what happens if we take a system\noffline and we discover in six months\n\n379\n00:23:47.716 --> 00:23:51.569\nthere's data on it we still need, cuz\nwe haven't completely destroyed it yet.\n\n380\n00:23:51.569 --> 00:23:53.030\nWhere are those keys?\n\n381\n00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.839\nDid we manage and maintain the keys,\nso that we could get to it?\n\n382\n00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:57.279\n>> They're always in a couch cushion.\n\n383\n00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.599\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:23:58.599 --> 00:24:00.525\n>> Or did we, oops, forget it and\n\n385\n00:24:00.525 --> 00:24:02.238\naccidentally destroy it.\n\n386\n00:24:02.238 --> 00:24:08.771\nSo, the disposal process could actually be\nbroken out in to several different phases,\n\n387\n00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:14.422\nin terms of insuring that the memory\nis completely clear of any useful data,\n\n388\n00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:17.880\nthe hard drives have been scrubbed.\n\n389\n00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:23.790\nMaybe there are databases, for instance,\nwhere there's residual data left.\n\n390\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.900\nI ran into this recently in\nan organization I was working with,\n\n391\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.880\nwhere they were pulling old copies\nof backups from a mainframe\n\n392\n00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.280\nin to build this new database system.\n\n393\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.210\nAnd lo and behold, they didn't realize it.\n\n394\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.260\nBecause they weren't addressing\nthe tables, but there were actually\n\n395\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:46.260\ntables inside the database that contained\nbank routing and account information.\n\n396\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.410\nAnd it wasn't until I said, well show\nme the database, and they went, yeah,\n\n397\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.220\nthere's a table with\nbanking information on it.\n\n398\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.830\nWell, why is that there?\n\n399\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.700\nWell we don't know.\n\n400\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.300\nWe just got handed the database.\n\n401\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.210\nWe don't publish that.\n\n402\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.320\nWe don't,\nwe're just looking at these tables.\n\n403\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.220\nWell, but did you look at all\nthe tables to see if there was data\n\n404\n00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.180\nin there that needs to be destroyed?\n\n405\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.540\nAnd sure enough, we found a couple, so\n\n406\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.960\nwe were able to destroy those\ntables inside the database.\n\n407\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.840\nSo anyway, those are the kinds\nof things that you will\n\n408\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.980\nrun into in system development life\ncycle acquisition, implementation.\n\n409\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.090\nThey don't call it destruction here.\n\n410\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.530\nIt's acquisition, development,\nand implementation.\n\n411\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.760\nBut really, there should be another\nword on the end of that title,\n\n412\n00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.640\nwhich is destruction or decommissioning or\ndisposal or something like that.\n\n413\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.920\nBecause that, in my opinion,\nI also have a security background,\n\n414\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.390\nin case you students out\nthere don't know that.\n\n415\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.500\nThat's every bit as important\nas the rest of that stuff.\n\n416\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.780\nBecause how many times a week do we read\nin the newspaper where a stolen laptop,\n\n417\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.600\nor a lost laptop, or a hard drive shows\nup somewhere it shouldn't with tons and\n\n418\n00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.210\ntons of data on it because\nit wasn't encrypted?\n\n419\n00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:58.318\n>> My favorite is the least multi\ndevice the printer, fax, copier thing.\n\n420\n00:25:58.318 --> 00:26:00.010\nYou said it's got a hard drive in it.\n\n421\n00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.910\nIt's taking images of everything and\nmaking PDFs and storing it.\n\n422\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.120\nYou turn it back in, people are ransacking\nthese storage facilities to get these-\n\n423\n00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.020\n>> Yeah, one of the classic scams is\n\n424\n00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.080\nthis guy shows up at your front door\nclaiming he's from the printer company.\n\n425\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.200\nAnd he's here to give you a temporary\nloan because there's something wrong.\n\n426\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.840\nYou got a factory recall on it.\n\n427\n00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.970\nHe walks out the door with your system,\ngoes pull the hard drive out,\n\n428\n00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.860\nputs another one back in and\ncomes back, yeah we got it all fixed.\n\n429\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.850\n>> Good to go.\n>> And he's got all your documents.\n\n430\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:34.420\nYeah, that's actually happened in a couple\nof banking environments I worked in.\n\n431\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.589\nBut so the point is, and\n\n432\n00:26:37.589 --> 00:26:42.510\ndisposable should also talk about.\n\n433\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.300\nBut we don't this isn't on the exam\njust a little tid bit story is-\n\n434\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.350\n>> Part of disclaimer random aside.\n\n435\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.330\n>> Yeah repurposing.\n\n436\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.150\nYeah, so a lot of people don't do this.\n\n437\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.780\nI was in an organization\njust a few weeks ago.\n\n438\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.598\nWhere I was finally given my own PC.\n\n439\n00:26:58.598 --> 00:27:00.770\nSo that, cuz I do a lot of work there,\nand when I come in,\n\n440\n00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.750\nthat way I've got a system to work with.\n\n441\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.130\nAnd they'de simply taken someone else's\nmachine and put an account on it for me.\n\n442\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.150\nSo I logged in.\n\n443\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.750\nThe first thing I did being a security and\naudit guy was go, well,\n\n444\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.020\nnumber one,\nyou just violated all your policies.\n\n445\n00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:13.520\nBut number two,\n\n446\n00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.740\nmore importantly, there's actually stuff\non here I can pull off the hard drive.\n\n447\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.164\nI run a little utility [NOISE].\n\n448\n00:27:18.164 --> 00:27:21.080\nPull up all the documents,\nspreadsheets, everything there.\n\n449\n00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.620\nI found malware on it.\n\n450\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.040\nSo the drive wasn't scrubbed\nit wasn't repurposed it wasn't\n\n451\n00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.895\nquote disposed of properly.\n\n452\n00:27:27.895 --> 00:27:31.700\nBecause that's part of\nrepurposing is proper disposal.\n\n453\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.730\nThe drive should've been\nscrubbed completely.\n\n454\n00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.890\nCompletely reimaged with a fresh image.\n\n455\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.798\nAnd only my profile stored on it so.\n\n456\n00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:43.720\n>> Well, that just goes to show you\nthe importance of making sure that we\n\n457\n00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.550\nfollow these procedures.\n\n458\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.180\nCuz if we don't,\nthen you have some sensitive data that,\n\n459\n00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.559\nyou let this guy in your office and\nhe's gonna snatch it off your PC.\n\n460\n00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.265\nAnd that's what we wanna avoid, right?\n\n461\n00:27:51.265 --> 00:27:53.463\nAnd if he's auditing you,\nthen it's really bad.\n\n462\n00:27:53.463 --> 00:27:55.575\n[LAUGH] He's gonna come and\nhit you with a stick.\n\n463\n00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:59.725\n>> And more importantly, we forget\nsometimes when we talk about audit, and\n\n464\n00:27:59.725 --> 00:28:03.825\nall the skills and\nsteps that are necessary to do a good job.\n\n465\n00:28:03.825 --> 00:28:09.105\nWe forget sometimes that, and Isaac is\nvery good about reminding folks of this.\n\n466\n00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:13.500\nThat the whole purpose of what\nwe're doing is to manage risk.\n\n467\n00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.040\nNot to check boxes and yell at people\nbecause they aren't following policies and\n\n468\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.890\nprocedures.\n\n469\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.030\nIt's really to manage risk.\n\n470\n00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.420\nAnd if they're doing\na good job of that then,\n\n471\n00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.920\nour job is to help them, not punish them.\n\n472\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.530\nAnd show them the error of their ways.\n\n473\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.010\n>> There you go right,\nit's a gentle hand of guidance.\n\n474\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.560\n>> That's right.\n\n475\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.290\n>> That's the way they\nlike to think of it.\n\n476\n00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.804\nIt's really a firm hand of vengeance.\n\n477\n00:28:34.804 --> 00:28:37.260\nSorry. [LAUGH] >> So\nI'm all of done with that.\n\n478\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.660\nI think that's enough for today.\n\n479\n00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.940\n>> Yes, I'm looking at our clock.\n\n480\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.690\nAnd we've definitely, and\nwe've expired our time.\n\n481\n00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:47.070\nBut we do thank you Brian, for\nteaching us the ways of the auditor.\n\n482\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.840\n>> You're welcome.\n>> And don't forget everyone,\n\n483\n00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.350\nhe is definitely one of\nthe authors of this great book.\n\n484\n00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.660\nThis is the fourth edition,\nthis is the new hotness right here.\n\n485\n00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.490\nIf you've got third,\nsecond, first, forget that.\n\n486\n00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:02.430\nRun out, grab a copy of the new CISA book\nwritten by one of the authors here today,\n\n487\n00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.870\nand we also have a couple\nof others as well.\n\n488\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.925\nDavid Cannon and\nAlan Keen as well/ Right Keen?\n\n489\n00:29:06.925 --> 00:29:07.710\nKeel.\n\n490\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.030\nSorry, I can't read.\n\n491\n00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.640\nThat being said.\n\n492\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.910\nWe just thank you for dropping by.\n\n493\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.340\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n494\n00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.880\nHope you've enjoyed this episode.\n\n495\n00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.010\nSigning off for ITProtv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n496\n00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.990\nAnd I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n497\n00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.042\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n498\n00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:28.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.305\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.410\nwe're continuing with our CISA series,\nthat's right.\n\n5\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.680\nI've got the book right here.\n\n6\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.950\nThe study guide, fourth edition,\n\n7\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.690\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor\nexam.\n\n8\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.520\nAnd joining us in the studio today,\n\n9\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.690\na treat, is one of the authors of said\nbook our good friend Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n10\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.700\nBrian welcome to the show,\nsir, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.320\n>> Thanks, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.760\nGood.\nThanks for having me again.\n\n13\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.200\nIn today's episode, we're going to talk,\n\n14\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.623\nwe're going to continue our discussion of\nsystem acquisition, implementation, etc.\n\n15\n00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:52.301\nAnd today we're gonna, in this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:58.510\nwe're gonna specifically talk about\nsoftware acquisition, implementation, etc.\n\n17\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.300\nAnd the reason that this is an important\npiece is because software is so\n\n18\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.480\nmuch more complicated\ntoday than hardware is.\n\n19\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.920\nWith hardware,\nit's generally fairly easy to\n\n20\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.940\nbe very specific about\nthe requirements that you need.\n\n21\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.860\nYou submit those to a vendor and\nyou get the hardware that you need with\n\n22\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.810\nthe proper amount of processing power,\nRAM, storage, etc., etc.\n\n23\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.810\nSoftware's much more complicated and\n\n24\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.060\ncan have much far-reaching problems or\nimpact if something goes wrong.\n\n25\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060\nAgain if a hard drive fails in\na system today we have redundancy.\n\n26\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.880\nHardware's so much more reliable\ntoday than it used to be.\n\n27\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.100\nOften times we use virtualization so we\nhave complete backup copies of the system.\n\n28\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.630\nWe can have backup and\nonline in mere seconds.\n\n29\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.330\nSoftware is not so easy again\nyou can be talking anywhere from\n\n30\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.570\nthousands to literally\nmillions of lines of code.\n\n31\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.700\nVery easy for mistakes to creep in,\nand of course, again,\n\n32\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.000\nfocusing on risk management as\npart of the audit industry.\n\n33\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.415\nWhat we're really trying to do in terms of\nthe software acquisition, implementation,\n\n34\n00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:16.600\netc, life cycle is to ensure that the\ncompanies that we're working with or for\n\n35\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.430\nare doing their proper due\ndiligence in evaluating software.\n\n36\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.120\nEnsuring that it's developed properly so\nthat\n\n37\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.080\nwhen it's completed not only does it\nfulfill the mission of the project, but\n\n38\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.520\nthat it also minimizes the risk to\nthe organization in terms of running it.\n\n39\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.490\nThings like completeness and accuracy\nof transactions we talked a little bit\n\n40\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.510\nin one of the previous episodes about SQL,\nthe transactional logs, and\n\n41\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.890\nthat kind of transactional log system that\nwe've been using for well over a decade or\n\n42\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.180\ntwo decades now with systems\nto ensure that transactions\n\n43\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.860\nare 100% accurate and complete\nbefore they're actually completed.\n\n44\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.799\nThere's a system built\nin to check all that.\n\n45\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.300\nSo, I wanna start off by talking\nabout a couple of different\n\n46\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.080\nmodels of software development.\n\n47\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.080\nThese will be on the test, you'll need to\nknow the fundamentals, not the details,\n\n48\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.730\nI'm gonna go into a few more details\ntoday because I think it's important for\n\n49\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.480\nless experienced auditors to understand\na little bit more about this.\n\n50\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.420\nTypically, we have a tendency to\nfocus on policies and processes.\n\n51\n00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.820\nAnd checking whether people\nare following their policies, etcetera.\n\n52\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.570\nBut software is such a huge\npart of what we're doing.\n\n53\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.490\nIt's basically the interface between\nhardware and the outside world.\n\n54\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.708\nThat it's really important that we\nunderstand how software is developed,\n\n55\n00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:47.050\ntested, implemented, etc.\n\n56\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.170\nSo the first model we're\ngonna talk about is\n\n57\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.740\na more traditional called\nthe waterfall model.\n\n58\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.020\nWink, wink.\n\n59\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.310\nThis will probably be on the test.\n\n60\n00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.800\nThe waterfall model really talks about\n\n61\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.400\ndoing things in very specific\nconcrete steps and stages,\n\n62\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.950\nnone of which will allow the next to start\nwithout the previous being completed.\n\n63\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.150\nSo step A must be completed and\nsigned off before step B can begin.\n\n64\n00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.550\nOr process B or section B.\n\n65\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.440\nSame thing with section C.\n\n66\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.190\nSection C cannot start, or begin,\n\n67\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.230\nuntil section B has been completed and\nsigned off.\n\n68\n00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.640\nI forget what the term is,\nbut therefore section C\n\n69\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.530\ncan't begin until both A and\nB have been completed and signed off.\n\n70\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.660\nSo you can see how very quickly this\ncan be a slow drudgery process.\n\n71\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.950\nDevelopers hate it.\n\n72\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.140\nIt is extremely reliable,\nwhich is why it was developed early on.\n\n73\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.080\nIn particular with Mainframe software\nback in the 70s, 60s and 70s and 80s.\n\n74\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.390\nThe model was developed because it was\nvery important in those days, one little\n\n75\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.970\nbit or one little byte out of place\ncould wreak havoc across a main frame.\n\n76\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.110\nIn today's world, it's very common for\n\n77\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.850\nall kinds of vulnerabilities to creep\ninto software which is why we're\n\n78\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.980\ngonna talk a little bit about some\nof the other models and testing etc.\n\n79\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.590\nbecause there's so many hundreds\nof thousands of lines of code.\n\n80\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.160\nThere's so many different languages.\n\n81\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.130\nIt's just very easy for\nerrors to creep in.\n\n82\n00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.590\nSo it's extremely important for\nus to find ways to test for that.\n\n83\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.920\nAnd because of the rapid\ndeployment cycle we live in today\n\n84\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.339\nwe don't have the time of\nthe waterfall model anymore.\n\n85\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.880\nThere are still some certain\nmission critical areas where it's\n\n86\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.520\nused like in banking and in mainframe\nprogramming where this occurs.\n\n87\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.358\nIn the financial services industry,\nfor instance, most banks today with\n\n88\n00:05:57.358 --> 00:06:01.980\nthe exception of the very, very large,\nChase's and Wells Fargo's.\n\n89\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.179\nAnd those who have their own systems\nof main frames most community banks,\n\n90\n00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:09.710\nyou know your local regional\nlake city bank or whatever here.\n\n91\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.200\nI don't know if I can say that or\nnot here.\n\n92\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.068\n>> That's fine.\n\n93\n00:06:12.068 --> 00:06:13.540\n>> in etc.\n\n94\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.280\nThey typically use cloud server providers\nfor that who have their own mainframes on\n\n95\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.410\nthe back end that do all the transactions\nthat you know when you go into the bank\n\n96\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.270\nand you make a deposit all that\nstuff goes up into the cloud.\n\n97\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.580\nIt is written and maintained in these\ngiant mainframes that they have in data\n\n98\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.670\ncenters across the world or\nacross the country.\n\n99\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.046\nThe code in those was written\n40 years ago or longer\n\n100\n00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:37.633\n>> were talking cobalt and horse ram.\n\n101\n00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:38.850\n>> Cobalt actually.\n\n102\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.920\nExclusively Cobalt.\n\n103\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.210\nIn fact one very large bank that I\nworked with last year in Indiana,\n\n104\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.140\nhas over 1.5 million lines of code\nwritten in COBAL in the mainframe systems\n\n105\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.588\nthey use to manage your student loans.\n\n106\n00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:56.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n107\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.650\nthey very rarely change that code and\nwhen they do, they go through exhaustive\n\n108\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.510\nregressive testing to make sure that\nnothing can go wrong in the transactions.\n\n109\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.650\nBecause if it did,\n\n110\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.870\nit could cost them millions of dollars\nin literally the blink of an eye.\n\n111\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.240\nSo it has to be absolutely rock solid.\n\n112\n00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.700\nIt has to be needed.\n\n113\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.110\nThey don't just patch stuff because\nsomebody thought it was a good idea.\n\n114\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:26.270\nThe other side of that is their code has\nbeen regression tested for 40 to 50 years.\n\n115\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.960\nAnd we know that it's rock solid and\nit works every single time.\n\n116\n00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.210\nThey have safeguards built in so that for\ninstance in, again in financial services,\n\n117\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.730\none of the things we talk about are ACH or\n\n118\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:46.900\nautomated batch transfers where I\nmight do an online bill payment.\n\n119\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.390\nAnd that actually goes through\nthe federal reserve bank and\n\n120\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.060\nclears overnight and\nthe money gets transferred, etc.\n\n121\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.880\nThere are a number of\nsteps in that process.\n\n122\n00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.738\nIf any one of those steps fails,\nthe entire transaction backs out and\n\n123\n00:07:58.738 --> 00:08:00.545\nstarts over or goes to the bank.\n\n124\n00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:01.722\nIt says, wait a minute, something failed,\nwe're gonna start over.\n\n125\n00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:06.162\nSo there are a lot of safe guards built\ninto the processes Just to prevent\n\n126\n00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:08.459\nproblems like that from happening.\n\n127\n00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:13.242\nSo Brian, would you say that the real\nbenefit of using this waterfall model is\n\n128\n00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:17.810\nthe fact that it really reduces\nyour risk of a problem happening?\n\n129\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.990\nAnd it could tend to slow things down.\n\n130\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.840\n>> Yep.\n>> Any one thing could\n\n131\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.180\ngrind you to a halt, but at least you\nknow everything is, that risk is being\n\n132\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.650\n>> Mitigated as much as possible.\n\n133\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.130\n>> Yeah.\nThat's absolutely right.\n\n134\n00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.450\nThat's its biggest strong point is\nthe fact that it's extremely reliable.\n\n135\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.360\nIt does take a long time\nto process code changes.\n\n136\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.890\nBut it reduces risk dramatically.\n\n137\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.750\nHowever in today's world,\nthat time can cost you a lot of money.\n\n138\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.880\nThat brings us to the next model\nthat I wanna talk about which has\n\n139\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.940\ngained a lot of attention over the last,\nprobably five or six years,\n\n140\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.400\nalthough it's been around for well over\na decade, and that's called Agile.\n\n141\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.960\nThe Agile model, and\nI've even seen this now applied, there was\n\n142\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.100\nan article in the Isaka magazine just two\nmonths ago about Agile project management.\n\n143\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.240\n>> Which is interesting, as I've told you,\n\n144\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.824\nproject management is a big\npart of ISOCA's knowledge base.\n\n145\n00:09:13.824 --> 00:09:19.584\nThe Agile model,\nI won't go into the Agile manifesto and\n\n146\n00:09:19.584 --> 00:09:26.310\nall the details of all that but,\nbasically it says that.\n\n147\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.180\n>> The people involved in\na software project and\n\n148\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.330\nthe ultimate outcome of the software\nis more important than the process.\n\n149\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.920\nOkay?\n\n150\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.700\nSo regression testing and\nsecurity testing and all that.\n\n151\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.440\nReally takes a backseat to,\ndoes the customer like it?\n\n152\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.190\nDoes it do what the customer wants?\n\n153\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.330\nWe'll do all the other stuff later if\nthey want us to or if they need us to.\n\n154\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.440\nBut we really want to know, does it do the\ntransactions the way the customer wants,\n\n155\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.230\nand does it do it fast enough?\n\n156\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.280\nAnd when I say customer,\nthat could be an internal department or\n\n157\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.000\nthat could be an external customer,\nit really depends.\n\n158\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.720\nSo it accomplishes a couple of things,\n\n159\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.590\nit helps software vendors bring\nproducts to market very quickly.\n\n160\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:12.790\nIt focuses on meeting the customer's\nneeds rather than the project's needs.\n\n161\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.130\nWhereas in a waterfall, you have a list\nof requirements, you must meet those and\n\n162\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.000\nif you don't meet those that next\nmodel is not gonna get signed off and\n\n163\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.410\nyou're not gonna proceed with the project.\n\n164\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.193\nSo what happened typically in large\nWaterfall projects is half way through\n\n165\n00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:32.600\nthe project the customer can come back and\nsay that's not what I really meant.\n\n166\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.360\nSo they would have to actually go back to\nground zero, rewrite the requirements and\n\n167\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.210\nsometimes literally start\nfrom scratch again.\n\n168\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.570\nAs you can imagine,\nthat really drags out cost over-runs.\n\n169\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.840\nIt causes time delays.\n\n170\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.870\nIt can be a huge problem.\n\n171\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.060\nA good example of that is\nin my home state Indiana.\n\n172\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.210\nWhat's called the Bureau\nof Motor Vehicles.\n\n173\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.090\nThe BMV was involved in\na huge lawsuit with IBM.\n\n174\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.130\nAnd just only a few years.\n\n175\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.370\nMaybe three years ago.\n\n176\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.080\nWhere IBM this was a multi-billion\ndollar project with the state.\n\n177\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.050\nWhere they came in and made a lot of\npromises about how they were gonna\n\n178\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:14.080\nrevolutionize the PNV process, which, you\nknow, is kind of an oxymoron by itself.\n\n179\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.930\nAnd, wound up going over a billion\ndollars in cost overruns.\n\n180\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.770\nIt was a year to two years\ndelayed in In implementation, and\n\n181\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.320\nfinally ended in a lawsuit.\n\n182\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.700\nThe state scrapped the whole project,\nkept their old systems,\n\n183\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.350\nand put out a new RFI or\nrequest for a bid.\n\n184\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.790\nSo it just failed miserably.\n\n185\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.710\nGreat example of waterfall project\nmanagement just crashed and burned.\n\n186\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.660\n>> Completely going awry.\n\n187\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.680\n>> Exactly.\n\n188\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.470\nThe other side of that is with Agile.\n\n189\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.150\nAnd I see this.\n\n190\n00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.050\nI have a customer I work with who\nhas a fairly large development shop.\n\n191\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.020\nAbout 50, 60 developers.\n\n192\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.370\nAnd it's an Agile based shop.\n\n193\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.080\nAnd they often times.\n\n194\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.640\nI don't want to bad rap them.\n\n195\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.490\nBut they often times give security.\n\n196\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.020\nAnd again, I'm a security person\nas much as I am an auditor.\n\n197\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.190\nCuz I'm all about risk.\n\n198\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.590\nThey give security a back seat.\n\n199\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.200\nSo I'm gonna talk in a minute,\n\n200\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.270\nwhen we talk about QA and QM about,\nthings like field validation,\n\n201\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.240\nif any of you have ever worked on a\nwebpage, where you can put in SQL queries.\n\n202\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.100\nOr you can put in all\nkinds of weird characters,\n\n203\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.840\nand you can test it see if it'll return\nall kinds of weird results depending on\n\n204\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.840\nhow well the code was written.\n\n205\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.540\nIf proper testing isn't done for\n\n206\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.450\nthose kinds of problems,\nAgile can get you into a lot of trouble.\n\n207\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:43.050\nIt can really creep vulnerabilities\ninto the application\n\n208\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.160\nthat you may not spot or be aware of\nuntil after the product is delivered.\n\n209\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.589\nSo, it may do what the consumer wants,\nbut it may not do it safely.\n\n210\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.700\nAnd if the customer didn't say\nsecurity's a part of my requirement,\n\n211\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.890\nyou've delivered to the customer.\n\n212\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.840\nYou get the check, everybody's happy.\n\n213\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.990\nAnd then three months down the road they\nfind out that by the way we're exposing\n\n214\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.860\ncustomer bank accounts.\n\n215\n00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.400\nThat's not a good thing to happen.\n\n216\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.150\n>> Yeah, typically people don't like that.\n\n217\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.670\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I know when I receive those\n\n218\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.160\ninformationals in the mail that say, by\nthe way we've had a data breach and yours\n\n219\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.910\nwas one of the datas that were breached\n>> And just FYI,\n\n220\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.482\nyou might need a new debit card.\n\n221\n00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:18.837\n[LAUGH] That's always a good time.\n\n222\n00:13:18.837 --> 00:13:20.530\n>> Right, so let's move on a little bit.\n\n223\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.100\nWe've talked about Waterfall and Agile.\n\n224\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.150\nThose are the two development models,\n\n225\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.310\napplication development models\nthat I wanted to talk about.\n\n226\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:33.420\nAnd let's talk a little bit about some of\nthe things that are used by developers to.\n\n227\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.820\n>> To minimize vulnerabilities or\nsecurity problems,\n\n228\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.930\nif you will,\nfrom creeping into their applications.\n\n229\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:47.070\nOne of the first things I want to\ntalk about, are input controls.\n\n230\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:52.030\nThose are the most common thing that,\nwe as auditors see, because we typically\n\n231\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.870\ndon't have development skills,\nwe don't know how to look at the raw code.\n\n232\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.590\nInput controls are things like\nwhat operate behind the scenes\n\n233\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.460\nwhen you go into a webpage and\nyou put in your username and password.\n\n234\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.480\nOr it's you're filling out a form, it asks\nyou for your first name and last name and\n\n235\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.010\nhas a little red asterisk that\nsays this is required etc.\n\n236\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.640\nExcuse me those input controls\nare the things that require that\n\n237\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.190\nsomething be in there and\nthe input control can even go farther and\n\n238\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:29.240\nrequire that what be put in\nthat field is a specific thing,\n\n239\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.060\nit could be only alphanumeric characters.\n\n240\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.320\nOne of the things I run into all\nthe time is my last name is spelled with\n\n241\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.820\nan apostrophe and a second capital letter.\n\n242\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.500\nMost systems don't know\nhow to handle that.\n\n243\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.490\nAnd they freak out.\n\n244\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.470\nEspecially if they're tied\nto any kind of a mainframe.\n\n245\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.580\nOr an old database in the backend.\n\n246\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.240\nThat doesn't know how to handle\nthose special types of characters.\n\n247\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.920\nOr the sequence of characters.\n\n248\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.750\nBecause number one it's not\nexpecting an apostrophe.\n\n249\n00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.030\nAnd it doesn't expect\na second capital letter.\n\n250\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.370\nIt expects most people's names start\nwith a first capital letter and\n\n251\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.730\nthen everything else lowercase.\n\n252\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.410\n>> Now Brian we do that to guard against\nthings like SQL injection, right?\n\n253\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.590\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n254\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.750\nAnd even more than that.\n\n255\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.870\nIn particular, not only SQL injection but\ncross site scripting and\n\n256\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.910\na number of other things.\n\n257\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.020\nI'm gonna show you some references\nto that here in a minute.\n\n258\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.130\nBut the important part to remember is\nthat when you're looking at those, and\n\n259\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:26.860\nprimarily I'm talking about web\napplications, but also this is true in\n\n260\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:33.370\napplications which tie into SQL databases.\n\n261\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.650\nSo they may or may not be web apps, they\nmay be, fact, clients that you're actually\n\n262\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.840\ntyping in or the company's using\nthat you're being asked to audit.\n\n263\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.815\nCuz we're really talking about\nlooking at the lifecycle, but\n\n264\n00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:46.017\nyou also may be asked to\naudit an application.\n\n265\n00:15:47.923 --> 00:15:51.790\nSo field validation, length of characters.\n\n266\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.800\nThere may be a limit on\nthe length of characters.\n\n267\n00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.525\nThat's another way to do it so\nthat you can't put really long.\n\n268\n00:15:56.525 --> 00:16:00.626\nYou mentioned SQL injection,\nI'll talk about that in a minute, but\n\n269\n00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:04.303\nbasically what that means is\ninjecting a command into an SQL,\n\n270\n00:16:04.303 --> 00:16:07.628\nwhich actually stands for\nStructured Query Language,\n\n271\n00:16:07.628 --> 00:16:12.577\nwhich is actually a database programming\nlanguage To insert a programming request\n\n272\n00:16:12.577 --> 00:16:16.492\nin the field that the database will\nread and spit back data to you.\n\n273\n00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:18.920\nYou wanna make sure that\nusers can't do that, so\n\n274\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.312\nyou wanna limit the number of characters,\nthe type of characters.\n\n275\n00:16:22.312 --> 00:16:27.310\nAnd you want the system to check\nthat prior to accepting the input,\n\n276\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.087\nso those are called input controls.\n\n277\n00:16:30.087 --> 00:16:34.995\nAnother good example too, is when you're\nasked to fill in your username and\n\n278\n00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:35.767\npassword.\n\n279\n00:16:35.767 --> 00:16:39.033\nIt can read your username or\nit'll say email address,\n\n280\n00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.960\nit's looking for the @ sign.\n\n281\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.581\nAnd it can also be as specific\nas looking for a .com or .org or\n\n282\n00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:52.620\na .tv or a .bank or\nsomething like that in the end or not.\n\n283\n00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.376\nAnd that's another way you can\nabsolutely control what happens when\n\n284\n00:16:57.376 --> 00:16:59.754\npeople input wrong information.\n\n285\n00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:02.110\nWe fat finger stuff all the time, but\n\n286\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.380\nwe also could be a hacker playing around\njust to see what the application will do.\n\n287\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.450\nA perfect example of that is putting\nin the wrong username and password and\n\n288\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.883\nwatching what it spits back to you,\nthat can be very revealing.\n\n289\n00:17:16.883 --> 00:17:22.005\nI had a, I won't say where,\nbut there was a bank I was\n\n290\n00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:27.482\nworking with about three years ago and\n[COUGH] excuse me,\n\n291\n00:17:27.482 --> 00:17:32.958\ntheir login screen,\nif you put in the wrong username and\n\n292\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.692\npassword would dump you to what\nlooked like an error page.\n\n293\n00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:43.480\nBut it actually contained information\nthat included the internal IP address of\n\n294\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.880\nthe database server.\n\n295\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.306\nIt told me that it was a cold fusion\nserver, told me what version it was and\n\n296\n00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:54.182\nwhen I reported it to the bank, they\ndidn't seem to be very concerned about it.\n\n297\n00:17:54.182 --> 00:17:58.882\n[LAUGH] So if you don't control input,\nif you don't have adequate\n\n298\n00:17:58.882 --> 00:18:04.110\ninput controls of those fields,\nall kinds of stuff can go haywire.\n\n299\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.190\nSo it's very important that\nthe developers understand that, and\n\n300\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.880\nthat they build those kinds of field\nvalidation controls into those.\n\n301\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.926\n>> Do they not realize that this is\nthe reason we firewall these things so\n\n302\n00:18:14.926 --> 00:18:16.722\nthat information is not disseminated?\n\n303\n00:18:16.722 --> 00:18:18.887\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well even sometimes,\n\n304\n00:18:18.887 --> 00:18:22.520\nI'll get an error back that\nsays my password's incorrect.\n\n305\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.545\nWell that tells me something,\nthat tells me what my username was.\n\n306\n00:18:26.545 --> 00:18:28.193\n>> Yeah.\n>> The best of those worlds is to not\n\n307\n00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:31.342\nreturn any information to the user,\njust simply don't do anything.\n\n308\n00:18:31.342 --> 00:18:32.501\n>> Try again, yeah.\n\n309\n00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:33.740\n>> The page jiggles, that's about it.\n\n310\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.770\n>> That's right.\n\n311\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.020\n>> And they have no idea\nwhat's actually going on.\n\n312\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.540\nSo I want you to understand how\nimportant input controls are, and\n\n313\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.700\nthen I want to talk a little bit\nabout something called OWASP.\n\n314\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:53.024\nLet me bring this up on the screen,\nI want you all to take a look at this.\n\n315\n00:18:53.024 --> 00:18:56.630\nThis is just for informational purposes,\nthis is not on the exam.\n\n316\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.072\nWe got a few minutes left in this episode\nand I wanna make sure everybody was aware\n\n317\n00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:06.010\nof not only what OWASP is,\nbut what the OWASP Top 10 is.\n\n318\n00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.480\nAnd if you look over here,\nI think I got it right this time.\n\n319\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.220\nI can do this and then that.\n\n320\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.509\nHere's OWASP, what the OWASP Top 10 is.\n\n321\n00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:21.600\nA list of the ten most critical\nweb application security risks.\n\n322\n00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.755\nCan you read that?\n\n323\n00:19:22.755 --> 00:19:24.941\n>> Yeah.\n>> That looks good on the screen?\n\n324\n00:19:24.941 --> 00:19:27.259\nAnd for\neach risk it provides a description,\n\n325\n00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:31.468\nan example of vulnerabilities, example\nattacks, guidance on how to avoid, and\n\n326\n00:19:31.468 --> 00:19:34.350\nreferences to OWASP and\nother related projects.\n\n327\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.230\nOWASP standing for\nthe Open Web Application Security Program.\n\n328\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.631\nThis is a worldwide program, what you're\ngonna really find interesting is,\n\n329\n00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:44.682\nyou are gonna look over on the right\nthere and see the Quick Downloads.\n\n330\n00:19:44.682 --> 00:19:49.169\nThere's the OWASP Top 10 2013.\n\n331\n00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:52.780\nIf you look around the site,\nyou will see 2014, 2012.\n\n332\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.040\nGuess what?\n\n333\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.710\nThose Top 10 haven't changed in 10 years.\n\n334\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.030\nThey simply move positions up and\ndown a couple, and that's it.\n\n335\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.180\nAnd while Daniel's smiling and\n\n336\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.650\nkinda chuckling, that's really concerning,\nbecause what that means is we're losing\n\n337\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.570\nthe battle against making\nthese applications better.\n\n338\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.327\n>> The reason I'm chuckling\nis because back in the day,\n\n339\n00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:15.969\nwhen I got into the security and\nsystems security.\n\n340\n00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:20.844\nYou learn all about these vulnerabilities\nin these things [COUGH] and then I go and\n\n341\n00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:25.720\nI become a systems administrator, and\nmostly spent my day building servers and\n\n342\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.050\nmore mundane tasks than hardening and\nguarding against hackers.\n\n343\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.678\nI come back in to getting\nback in to security-\n\n344\n00:20:32.678 --> 00:20:33.343\n>> That is security.\n\n345\n00:20:33.343 --> 00:20:35.988\n>> And I'm like I'm completely\non top of my game still.\n\n346\n00:20:35.988 --> 00:20:37.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A wonderful thing.\n\n347\n00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:38.183\n>> Nothing's change.\n\n348\n00:20:38.183 --> 00:20:39.362\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n349\n00:20:39.362 --> 00:20:41.278\nSo I would really like for\n\n350\n00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:46.310\nall our CISA candidates just to\nbe aware of what an OWASP is.\n\n351\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.540\nGo out and take a look at these.\n\n352\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.400\nLook at the examples of the SQL attack.\n\n353\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.350\nThere's actually some videos out\nthere that will show you in real time\n\n354\n00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.690\nhow an attacker does this, and how they\ngarner information about your company's or\n\n355\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.310\nthe company you're working with systems.\n\n356\n00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.956\nSo that you understand as part of\nthe system development lifecycle.\n\n357\n00:21:05.956 --> 00:21:09.111\nWe talked in the previous\nepisode about the review stage.\n\n358\n00:21:09.111 --> 00:21:12.376\nWell that's where we get into, and\nwe're not required to know how to do this,\n\n359\n00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:14.267\nunless it's something that interests you.\n\n360\n00:21:14.267 --> 00:21:17.298\nDoing vulnerability scanning and\ndoing vulnerability\n\n361\n00:21:17.298 --> 00:21:21.690\nassessments on your applications to\nmake sure that they're patched properly.\n\n362\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:28.875\nA large majority of the systems we\nwork with are Windows based servers.\n\n363\n00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:33.134\nSo the applications run on a Windows\nServer all the way from, believe it or\n\n364\n00:21:33.134 --> 00:21:36.365\nnot, there's still people\nrunning Server 2000,\n\n365\n00:21:36.365 --> 00:21:39.409\nclear up to Server 2016\nwhich is available now.\n\n366\n00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:45.600\nAnd not knowing that those servers\nmay bee grilled with vulnerabilities.\n\n367\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.952\nSo it's important that you\nunderstand how all this works,\n\n368\n00:21:48.952 --> 00:21:52.319\nhow it fits together in the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n369\n00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:56.849\nThe last thing I wanna talk about\nwas QA and QM, quality assurance and\n\n370\n00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.344\nquality management.\n\n371\n00:21:58.344 --> 00:22:04.570\nJust talking I wanna refer back to both\nthe agile and water file methods in that.\n\n372\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:08.945\nThose are both quality assurance and\nquality management methods for\n\n373\n00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:10.460\ndeveloping software.\n\n374\n00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.896\nAnd that you be familiar with those\nterms with the QA and the Qa.\n\n375\n00:22:15.896 --> 00:22:18.940\nDefinitions are in the book, there's\nmore reading about this in the book.\n\n376\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.750\nAnd there is more information on the ISACA\nwebsite at www.isaca.org, as well.\n\n377\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.745\nSo I think we're gonna wrap it up\nwith that for this morning session.\n\n378\n00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:31.264\nI think that's enough to chew off for\none more session and\n\n379\n00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:33.440\nwe'll see you back here at the next one.\n\n380\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.520\n>> All right Brian, you've definitely\ngiven us a lot to chew on,\n\n381\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.530\nbut we do appreciate you stopping by and\nenlightening our minds to these very facts\n\n382\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.699\nand things that we need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n383\n00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:44.210\nThat's kind of an important thing as well.\n\n384\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.440\nThat being said, don't forget everyone,\n\n385\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.260\npick up a copy of the new Study Guide\nFourth Edition that our good friend Mr.\n\n386\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.630\nBrian O'Hara here is\none of the authors of.\n\n387\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.600\nSo grab that from Wiley,\nI believe is the publishers on that.\n\n388\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.460\nAnd that being said, I'm looking at our\nclock, it is totally out of time for us.\n\n389\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.111\nThank you guys for watching, signing\noff for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n390\n00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:04.898\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n391\n00:23:04.898 --> 00:23:06.180\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n392\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.650\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n393\n00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.225\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.520\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.550\ntoday's episode were continuing\non with our CISA material.\n\n5\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.040\nJoining us in the studio again today\nis the author of our study guide for\n\n6\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.910\nthe certified information systems auditor.\n\n7\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450\nHe's our good friend, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n8\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.890\nBrian, welcome to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.210\nI know you're not the only author on that,\n\n10\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.760\nbut we like to make a big deal out of\nthe guy that's sitting next to me.\n\n11\n00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.260\n>> Thank you, David.\n\n12\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.770\nThank you.\n\n13\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank you Daniel, appreciate it.\n\n14\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.080\nGlad to be back here again for another\nexciting episode of IT Pro TV and CISA.\n\n15\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.540\nFor all those of you there in\nviewer world, I get excited about\n\n16\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770\ntalking about audit subjects, not\nthe rest of the world doesn't, but I do.\n\n17\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.830\nAnyway, so today we're going\nto continue on part five of\n\n18\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.100\nthe information system acquisition\ndevelopment and implementation domain.\n\n19\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.760\nDomain 3 in your CISA\nstudy prep materials.\n\n20\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.600\nAnd, in this episode I want to talk about,\n\n21\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.550\nI want to get down to\nthe weeds a little bit.\n\n22\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.030\nI kept a couple sessions rather higher\nlevels, talking about policies and\n\n23\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.410\nsteering committees and\nhow things are supposed to work.\n\n24\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.020\nThis episode I want to\nget down in the weeds and\n\n25\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.510\ntalk about who is actually\ndoing all of this stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.050\nWho's doing all the testing\nof these applications or\n\n27\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.260\nthese systems and what are the roles and\nhow do they all fit together?\n\n28\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.182\nSo, and again, I want to stress that\niSocket is a world wide organization\n\n29\n00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:42.970\nwith over 118,000 members\nin 80 some countries.\n\n30\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.870\nSo, they tend to take a very large\nenterprise view of the universe, and\n\n31\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.410\nthat's what we're going to\nbe talking about today.\n\n32\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.690\nThis doesn't mean that every IT\norganization you work in, or\n\n33\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.620\neven any of the IT organizations you work\nin are going to have this many folks\n\n34\n00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.616\ninvolved in the acquisition implementation\nor design phases of information systems.\n\n35\n00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.070\nBut, we want to talk about them because\nyou need to be familiar with them\n\n36\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.680\non the exam.\n\n37\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.960\nAnd, it's important for\nyou to know as your career grows and\n\n38\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.020\nyou move into more complex environments.\n\n39\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.440\nSo, [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n40\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.830\nAt the top of the food chain.\n\n41\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.450\nAnd one other sidenote real quick.\n\n42\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.650\nWe've talked about resources and\n\n43\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.550\nwhat are information systems, and\n\n44\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.695\nI mentioned a couple of episodes ago about\nhuman resources being part of the systems.\n\n45\n00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.170\nThat`s what we are really\ntalking about today.\n\n46\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.028\nThese resource individuals are part of\nyour information access management,\n\n47\n00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:46.610\nexcuse me acquisition, implementation and\nmanagement of information systems.\n\n48\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.660\nThey are assets that help us\ndeploy all that stuff and\n\n49\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.830\nmake sure that we're managing\nrisk to acceptable levels.\n\n50\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.380\nSo, we'll start off there are actually\n17 roles outlined in the book in\n\n51\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.100\nchapter five.\n\n52\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.670\nIf you take a look I\nforget the exact page.\n\n53\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.230\nBut, it starts with the IT director.\n\n54\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.330\nAnd, you can go through the book and\n\n55\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.610\nread these for yourself and see\nthe definitions, but I want to talk about\n\n56\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.990\neach of the roles simply because my years\nof experience give me the ability to talk\n\n57\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.600\nabout how I've seen these roles played\nout in different organizations.\n\n58\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.160\nSo, the IT director is typically\nsomeone who works below the CIO level.\n\n59\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.910\nThey are involved in\nday to day operations.\n\n60\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:34.310\nThe CIO is more interested or\nbusier dealing with things like budgets,\n\n61\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.040\noverall project management of\nmultiple project portfolios.\n\n62\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.240\nWhere the IT director is generally\nin charge of just a small portion of\n\n63\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.040\nthe IT domain if you will,\nhaving to do with systems.\n\n64\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.970\nBelow the IT Director, generally there's\nan operations manager of some kind.\n\n65\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.450\nOr, the IT Director have\nsome type of staff.\n\n66\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.920\nAgain, we're talking about\na very large organization.\n\n67\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.040\nMaybe thousands of employees\nin multiple locations.\n\n68\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.950\nAnd in fact,\nthere may be multiple operation managers,\n\n69\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.680\ndepending on how large your organization\nis and how big the IT staff is.\n\n70\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.200\nI remember years ago working\nwith a large automobile,\n\n71\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.066\ncar auction company that had\n\n72\n00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:24.220\nan IT budget in somewhere in the\nneighborhood of $50 to $75 million a year.\n\n73\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.770\nAnd they had.\n\n74\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.851\n>> So it's a small shop.\n\n75\n00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:26.542\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n76\n00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:31.430\n[LAUGH] Yeah, they had roughly 250\nIT employees with multiple managers,\n\n77\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.910\nthat multiple managers working under\nIT directors in different states,\n\n78\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.060\nin different regions,\neven some outside the country.\n\n79\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.760\nThey had operations in Canada and Mexico.\n\n80\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.710\nThe number of IT operation managers\ncan vary depending on the size or\n\n81\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.970\nthe organization.\n\n82\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.230\nThe point being that the, and\n\n83\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.100\nthese typically have a direct\nreporting structure up and down.\n\n84\n00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.460\nYou'll see multiple IT operation\nmanagers reporting to the IT director,\n\n85\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.320\nand generally there's only one director.\n\n86\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.600\nThey may break it up and\ncall it something different, but\n\n87\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.510\ngenerally you've only got one director,\n\n88\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.080\nwho then reports up to the CIO because\nhe may have, the CIO, may in fact have\n\n89\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.030\na project management office director\nthat reports to him as well, or her.\n\n90\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.430\nAnd, in many organizations, to my dismay,\nthe CISO will report directly to the CIO.\n\n91\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.690\nThe Chief Information Security Officer.\n\n92\n00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.680\nBut, again, it's important that you\nunderstand that these positions exist,\n\n93\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.900\nand their functions.\n\n94\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.850\n>> Got to know the pecking order.\n\n95\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.940\n>> Not so much the pecking order as\nthe fact that they provide a very\n\n96\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.425\nfunctional role in the organization\nin terms of getting things done.\n\n97\n00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.048\nBecause it takes a lot of people-\n>> Do they really, Brian?\n\n98\n00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:43.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It\n\n99\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.990\ntakes a lot of people to keep\nthese large organizations running.\n\n100\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.070\n>> And, you tend to see this with\nlarger organizations, right?\n\n101\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.080\n>> Right.\n>> And then smaller shops,\n\n102\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.100\nobviously there's just not enough\npersonnel to facilitate or need.\n\n103\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.870\n>> And there's not a need, that's right,\nthere's typically not a need for that.\n\n104\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.210\nAnd, in addition to that in smaller shops,\nfolks often wear multiple hats.\n\n105\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.785\nSo, they may be both an operations\nmanager and an IT director.\n\n106\n00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:09.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just depends on the-\n\n107\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.300\n>> And the janitor.\n\n108\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.020\n>> And the janitor,\nexactly, etcetera, etcetera.\n\n109\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.440\nSo, the next role that I'd like\nto talk a little bit about,\n\n110\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.710\nwhich is really rather important,\nis the system architect and\n\n111\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.558\nI get asked quite often why\nare they called architects?\n\n112\n00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:27.470\nWell, an architect in\n\n113\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.580\nthe realm of buildings is the person\nwho designs the building.\n\n114\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.220\nAnd, when I say design I\nmean they draw the pictures.\n\n115\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.700\nThey don't actually get down in the weeds\nwith, what kind of steel you use,\n\n116\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.970\nalthough they might.\n\n117\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.660\nThey don't get down in the weeds with,\nwhat's the local code for\n\n118\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.760\nhow much rebar has to be put in concrete,\n\n119\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.140\ndepending on how deep the basement is,\nblah, blah, blah, all the details.\n\n120\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.530\nThey're the Frank Lloyd Wrights of\nthe world who design beautiful sculptures\n\n121\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.150\nof buildings, and then let the engineers\nfigure out how to actually build it, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.630\nSystem architects are very similar.\n\n123\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.140\nThey're the ones who design\nthe systems that say, well,\n\n124\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.430\nwe're going to need 16 CPU cores.\n\n125\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.400\nWe're going to need at\nleast 64 gig of RAM, and\n\n126\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.350\nwe need flash drives because this is\na web-based application for e-commerce.\n\n127\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.080\nAnd, the last thing we want\nto do is have it running slow\n\n128\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.520\nwhen people want to be doing transactions.\n\n129\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.590\nOr, they might say well, these\nsystems are the ones that we're going\n\n130\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.450\nto use during the holiday season\nwhen our traffic is the heaviest.\n\n131\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.840\nOr, they may say, let's design\nsomething up in the AWS cloud for\n\n132\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.970\nscaling up during the holidays and\nwe'll only use it during that period.\n\n133\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.140\nAnd then, when we're finished,\nwell, we'll scale it back down.\n\n134\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.050\nWe'll shut those services off so that\nthey're, because they're no longer needed.\n\n135\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.780\n>> Yeah Brian, it sounds like\nthe architects have to a very, overall\n\n136\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.940\nan encompassing foundational knowledge\nof the IT systems as a whole.\n\n137\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.149\n>> Right.\n>> So, that they can effectively design\n\n138\n00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.589\nthese systems to work\nthe way we need them to.\n\n139\n00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:56.689\n>> That's right Daniel,\n\n140\n00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:59.549\nyour architects are sometimes\nsome of the brightest people.\n\n141\n00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:03.583\nThe problem you have to be\ncareful with is they oftentimes\n\n142\n00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.525\n>> Have great ideas, but they don't\n\n143\n00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:13.128\nrealize there are stumbling blocks to\nimplementing those kinds of systems.\n\n144\n00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:16.348\nSo, the system architects\nare the ones who develop the needs.\n\n145\n00:08:16.348 --> 00:08:19.389\nWe talked in the previous\nepisode about that process\n\n146\n00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:22.014\nof finding out what\nthe customer needs are for\n\n147\n00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:26.178\nthe application or system,\nwhat it ever is that they're looking for.\n\n148\n00:08:26.178 --> 00:08:29.763\nThe system architect is the one\nwho takes all that and says, well,\n\n149\n00:08:29.763 --> 00:08:32.965\nif this customer is saying that\nwe need this much capacity,\n\n150\n00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:35.797\nthen we're gonna have to\ndesign a system like this.\n\n151\n00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:39.980\nA system architect is very involved\nwhen you're talking about telling\n\n152\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.128\ncommunications and\ndesigning redundant circuits.\n\n153\n00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:44.848\nDesigning redundant hardware.\n\n154\n00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:49.588\nSo that if a firewall, for instance fails,\nyou still have some safety in place,\n\n155\n00:08:49.588 --> 00:08:53.788\na safety net in place and you're able\nto continue to conduct business.\n\n156\n00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:54.968\nThings like that, so\n\n157\n00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:58.978\nthey architect all kinds of things\nare a very important part of the team.\n\n158\n00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:02.318\nIt's often times is smaller organizations.\n\n159\n00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:06.474\nIt's a service that's outsourced,\nbecause it is so critical and\n\n160\n00:09:06.474 --> 00:09:09.378\ncompanies often times\ndon't have the staff.\n\n161\n00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:13.648\nYou'll see system architects\nboth in IT and in security.\n\n162\n00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:18.481\nSecurity architects are also something\nthat you see in a lot of larger\n\n163\n00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.982\norganizations, because it takes\na lot of years of knowledge and\n\n164\n00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:27.338\nunderstanding of the complexity\nof the products available.\n\n165\n00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:31.289\nAnd the pitfalls of deploying\napplications to understand\n\n166\n00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:35.808\nhow to build security systems to\nprotect those systems, as well.\n\n167\n00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:40.931\nAnd then lastly, of course,\nwith the onslaught of attacks\n\n168\n00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:47.498\nlike the recent banking attack in\nBangladesh that cost the bank over there.\n\n169\n00:09:47.498 --> 00:09:49.238\nI believe it was $18 million.\n\n170\n00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:53.318\nI saw at lunch,\nI got an update on the attack over there.\n\n171\n00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:56.468\nSo your system architects are really,\nreally, really very important.\n\n172\n00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:59.731\nYour IT directors a little bit\nmore of a higher level manager\n\n173\n00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.438\nthan your operation manager.\n\n174\n00:10:01.438 --> 00:10:06.260\nYour system architect usually\nsits off to the side, but\n\n175\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.858\na very, very important part of the team.\n\n176\n00:10:09.858 --> 00:10:14.022\nBelow that or next to that,\nI should say next to the line, but\n\n177\n00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:17.546\nnext to that is the information\nsecurity manager.\n\n178\n00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:20.866\nAnd I wanna take just\na quick minute to mention,\n\n179\n00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:24.858\nISACA has a certification called,\nwhich I hold as well.\n\n180\n00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:28.558\nThe CISM or\nCertified Information Security Manager.\n\n181\n00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:34.448\nThose CISMs are designed to fit into\nthis slot, and work with CIOs, etc.\n\n182\n00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:38.711\nA security manager is\nsomeone who works with\n\n183\n00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:43.558\nsecurity analysts,\nthat's the next rung down.\n\n184\n00:10:43.558 --> 00:10:47.116\nMuch like the system architect and\nthe operation manager,\n\n185\n00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:51.883\nthe information security analyst is led\nby the information security manager to\n\n186\n00:10:51.883 --> 00:10:56.723\nhelp them ensure that things occur like\nthe field validation and the application\n\n187\n00:10:56.723 --> 00:11:00.948\ntesting that we talked about in\nthe previous episode actually occur.\n\n188\n00:11:00.948 --> 00:11:04.692\nThey look for problems and\nvulnerabilities in the applications, and\n\n189\n00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:05.838\noperating systems.\n\n190\n00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:10.592\nFor instance, one of the things that\nthe security analyst and the security\n\n191\n00:11:10.592 --> 00:11:15.576\nmanager probably do are follow Microsoft\nbulletins about vulnerabilities,\n\n192\n00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:20.180\nso that they can stay abreast of the types\nof problems they might have with\n\n193\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.619\nthe operating systems that they use.\n\n194\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.429\nI will talk a little bit later\n\n195\n00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:34.831\nabout operating systems and\n\n196\n00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:41.258\nthe system analysts that work with that.\n\n197\n00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:45.276\nSo you saw we have an it director, an\noperations manager and a system architect.\n\n198\n00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:48.809\nNow, we've also got an information\nsecurity manager and\n\n199\n00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:53.508\nanalyst who work together to be able\nto identify security vulnerabilities.\n\n200\n00:11:53.508 --> 00:11:58.083\nAgain, we're talking about a team of\nfolks who work together hopefully\n\n201\n00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:02.208\nto ensure that the systems that\nthe organization is acquiring and\n\n202\n00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:05.508\nbeginning to bring online and\nput into production.\n\n203\n00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:10.318\nMeet all the requirements for risk\nmanagement purposes and get the job done.\n\n204\n00:12:10.318 --> 00:12:13.711\n>> Now Brian,\nas our companies grow, right,\n\n205\n00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:18.123\nobviously we have small,\nmedium and large businesses.\n\n206\n00:12:18.123 --> 00:12:23.186\nAs they grow, are these roles becoming\nmore and more of a necessity or they're\n\n207\n00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:28.263\nstill like we don't actually need them but\nwe would benefit from having them?\n\n208\n00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:33.643\nWhen does it become a need versus,\nwell, if we have the ability?\n\n209\n00:12:33.643 --> 00:12:35.883\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a tough question to answer.\n\n210\n00:12:35.883 --> 00:12:41.180\nI think really the answer is when you find\nthat your information systems acquisition\n\n211\n00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.655\nand implementations begin to bring\nmore risk in house than they solve or\n\n212\n00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:49.012\nthat they manage,\nthen you've got some problems and\n\n213\n00:12:49.012 --> 00:12:53.218\nyou've got to take a look at some\nof this see if some of those rolls.\n\n214\n00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:57.739\nWorst case scenario, you should at least\nbe able to outsource these functions to\n\n215\n00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:01.538\nother companies, and be able to go\nto them for help when you need it.\n\n216\n00:13:01.538 --> 00:13:06.303\nSo next, I'd like to talk a little bit and\nwe're gonna circle back around to this,\n\n217\n00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:09.570\neither in the next episode or\nif we don't run out of time,\n\n218\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.958\nmaybe some in this one and that's about\nthat could change control manager.\n\n219\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.148\nChange control is humongously important.\n\n220\n00:13:17.148 --> 00:13:18.468\nIs that really a word humongous?\n\n221\n00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:19.728\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Humongously important-\n\n222\n00:13:19.728 --> 00:13:20.368\n>> It is now.\n\n223\n00:13:20.368 --> 00:13:22.408\n[LAUGH]\n>> In the world of audit,\n\n224\n00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:26.683\nbecause that's one of the first things\nthat I also I look at when I go in\n\n225\n00:13:26.683 --> 00:13:30.589\nto do an audit is I wanna see all\nof the change management logs and\n\n226\n00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:35.235\nI wanna talk and interview to people\nto find out whether there are instances\n\n227\n00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:39.768\nwhere change occurs without a change\nmanagement process taking place.\n\n228\n00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:45.100\nSo even though there's a change management\nboard pr called sometimes a committee,\n\n229\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.836\ndepending on the company.\n\n230\n00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:51.216\nThere should be some type of\nchange management process.\n\n231\n00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:55.888\nOftentimes, we associate change\nmanagement with ongoing operations,\n\n232\n00:13:55.888 --> 00:14:00.259\nbut it's also important when you're\nworking with system design and\n\n233\n00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:04.779\nacquisition and implementation to\nmake sure that the systems if they do\n\n234\n00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:08.578\nchange between the initial requirements or\ndesign, etc.\n\n235\n00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:13.148\nAnd the time you receive them,\nthat those changes are adequately vetted.\n\n236\n00:14:13.148 --> 00:14:19.100\nWe've talked a little bit at the break\nabout ordering a machine with say,\n\n237\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.268\n8 core processors and 64 gig of RAM.\n\n238\n00:14:22.268 --> 00:14:28.068\nAnd all of a sudden,\nit ships with 128 gig of RAM.\n\n239\n00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:29.788\nWell, what does that do?\n\n240\n00:14:29.788 --> 00:14:33.300\nWe often times think that,\nthat's a really cool thing,\n\n241\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.068\nbut there are other times when we don't\nreally know for sure what that means.\n\n242\n00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.970\nSo, we have to try to invent someone else.\n\n243\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.718\nLet me close my laptop there.\n\n244\n00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:50.862\nSo, the control manager is the person\nwho's generally in control of, intended.\n\n245\n00:14:50.862 --> 00:14:54.715\nThe change management process,\nthe change management board,\n\n246\n00:14:54.715 --> 00:14:58.368\nwhich we're gonna talk about I\nbelieve in the next episode.\n\n247\n00:14:58.368 --> 00:15:01.468\nSo, stay tuned for more on that.\n\n248\n00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.868\nThere's the role of\nthe application programmer.\n\n249\n00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:04.828\nThat one's pretty simple.\n\n250\n00:15:04.828 --> 00:15:06.008\nMost of us kinda get that.\n\n251\n00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:10.778\nThat's the person who sits at the keyboard\nand writes code and then turns it in and\n\n252\n00:15:10.778 --> 00:15:15.991\nhopes that it's all done really well, but\nthen there's also the system programmers.\n\n253\n00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:21.269\nTypically, most of us will\nnever have any interaction\n\n254\n00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:26.788\nwith system programmers,\nbecause that's Microsoft.\n\n255\n00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:31.528\nThere the ones who write the operating\nsystem or that's the Linux people.\n\n256\n00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:35.587\nWe might in the course of Linux, if we\nwere to wanna customize the kernel, for\n\n257\n00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:36.218\ninstance.\n\n258\n00:15:36.218 --> 00:15:39.508\nYou don't need to know any of this for\nthe exam, this is just side bar stuff.\n\n259\n00:15:39.508 --> 00:15:42.992\nBut if we were playing around\nwith Linux operating systems and\n\n260\n00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:46.744\nwe wanted to change the kernel or\nchange the build for some reason,\n\n261\n00:15:46.744 --> 00:15:49.908\na system programmer would come\nin to play with all that.\n\n262\n00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.168\nBut generally, we don't mix with that.\n\n263\n00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:54.108\nApple computers, Microsoft computers.\n\n264\n00:15:54.108 --> 00:15:57.139\nNow, one other place where we might\nsee a system programmer is in\n\n265\n00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:58.436\na mainframe environment.\n\n266\n00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:02.846\nAgain, if you're working in a large\nfinancial institutions where\n\n267\n00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:07.642\nmainframes are still somewhat prevalent\nWe think of them as dinosaurs but\n\n268\n00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:12.690\nthey do what they do faster and\nbetter than anything else ever invented.\n\n269\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.120\nIt's just that they\ndon't do fancy graphics,\n\n270\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.900\nyou can't do instant messaging chat\non a mainframe, things like that.\n\n271\n00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.931\n>> No cool factor too.\n\n272\n00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:22.909\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n273\n00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:26.925\nBut when you're doing financial\ntransactions that have to be absolutely\n\n274\n00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:31.720\n100% accurate, 100% of the time,\nthere isn't anything better to do that.\n\n275\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.620\n>> I worked at an insurance company and\nthey had mainframes systems.\n\n276\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.805\nA lot of the systems ran off of that\nmainframe, but they were really pushing to\n\n277\n00:16:39.805 --> 00:16:43.095\nget off of the mainframe hit,\nbecause the cost was so high.\n\n278\n00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:44.625\n>> They are extremely expensive.\n\n279\n00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:48.695\n>> Do you think that we'll ever get\naway from mainframes as a system and\n\n280\n00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:49.815\ngo all server based?\n\n281\n00:16:49.815 --> 00:16:53.840\n>> I don't think so, simply because\nthey can handle so many transactions, so\n\n282\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.860\nfast and they can store so much data.\n\n283\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.470\nI think that what'll happen is that\ncompanies that stop using them will stop\n\n284\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.580\ndoing so because they're so expensive.\n\n285\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.240\nBut the companies that can\nafford it will still do it.\n\n286\n00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.340\nThe Federal Government still uses them,\nthe IRS still uses them.\n\n287\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.520\nThe IRS uses them, they're not gonna\ngo away for a really long time.\n\n288\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.502\n>> So I should learn COBOL tomorrow.\n\n289\n00:17:12.502 --> 00:17:15.910\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well they just do exactly what they do\n\n290\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.930\nbetter than anything else\nthat's ever been invented.\n\n291\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.700\nThey just only do a very small\nsubset of what we do with\n\n292\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.840\ncomputers today in the real world.\n\n293\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.700\n>> It's one trick pony.\n\n294\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.480\nIt's an amazing trick,\nbut it's a one trick pony.\n\n295\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.275\n>> It is.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:17:26.275 --> 00:17:27.862\n>> It's more than an amazing trick,\n\n297\n00:17:27.862 --> 00:17:31.945\nit's an absolutely mind blowing trick, but\nit is only a single trick, you're right.\n\n298\n00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:33.880\nSo there are system programmers,\nand you may or\n\n299\n00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.140\nmay not ever have any\ninteraction with them.\n\n300\n00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:41.120\nIf any of you have ever used an AS 400,\nwhich I would get my fingers slapped for\n\n301\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.100\ncalling it mainframe but it's kind\nof a baby mainframe, if you will.\n\n302\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.570\nIf you've ever used and AS 400 in\na banking or financial environment or\n\n303\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.530\neven in something like an insurance\ncompany, where I'm sure that's what\n\n304\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.090\nthey were probably using, they called them\nmainframes so they were probably AS 400s,\n\n305\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.180\nthey're just really rock solid.\n\n306\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.120\nThey do not touch the code very often.\n\n307\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.040\nThey have very strict access controls.\n\n308\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.580\nThat's another piece of the reason\nto keep mainframes around, is\n\n309\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.480\nthat the role based access controls that\nthey have in place are extremely reliable,\n\n310\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.470\none of the reasons the Department of\nDefense and the Military use them.\n\n311\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.590\nThey're just virtually impenetrable.\n\n312\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.095\nYou simply aren't gonna go on\nyour coffee break and hack one.\n\n313\n00:18:25.095 --> 00:18:26.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just not gonna happen.\n\n314\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.127\nVery, very robust, very reliable systems,\nbut very expensive and\n\n315\n00:18:30.127 --> 00:18:34.230\nvery difficult to find programmers for\nit today because they mostly run on COBOL.\n\n316\n00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.500\nSo next on the list is the NXC.\n\n317\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.040\nWe're starting to run\nout of time already so\n\n318\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.740\nI'll step it up a little, the software\nQA tester, a quality assurance tester.\n\n319\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.570\nTypically you have, and again, we go back\nto the idea of separation of duties where\n\n320\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:54.020\nyou don't want the actual programmers\ntesting their own software because\n\n321\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.240\nthey have a vested interest in\ntelling you that it's all good, right?\n\n322\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.820\nThey are not there looking for\ntheir own problems but\n\n323\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.830\neven more importantly is we typically\ndon't see our own mistakes,\n\n324\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.180\nthat's why you need a second\npair of eyes on it.\n\n325\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.150\nSo that's typically what a QA tester does.\n\n326\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.150\nThis is not included in the list but often\ntimes you'll see, there's a company I work\n\n327\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.710\nwith in Indiana, they have what they\nhave a UX or User Experience tester.\n\n328\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.780\nPart of their testing platform,\n\n329\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.280\nis to actually have an end\nuser try the application, and\n\n330\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.750\nsee if it actually does what\nthe customer asked of it.\n\n331\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.760\nNext, are some things that are probably\nnear and dear to Daniel's heart, and\n\n332\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.380\nthat's the network and server admins.\n\n333\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.330\nThe network admins are typically\nthe folks who take care of the routers,\n\n334\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.690\nand the switches, and\nthe firewalls, etcetera.\n\n335\n00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.640\nAll that layer three, layer four stuff,\nlayer two stuff, and some layer one.\n\n336\n00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.445\n>> The guys that get yelled\nat when something goes wrong.\n\n337\n00:19:48.445 --> 00:19:49.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, really.\n\n338\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.350\nThe Internet has stopped.\n\n339\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.960\n>> Why is my email not coming through?\n\n340\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.360\n>> I think the last time I looked,\nthe Internet was still working.\n\n341\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.571\n>> Yeah.\nThe Internet is still going.\n\n342\n00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.289\n[LAUGH]\n>> I don't think it really stopped.\n\n343\n00:19:58.289 --> 00:19:59.530\n>> You're not bringing that down.\n\n344\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.206\n>> My favorite commercial of all time was\nback in, must have been close to 2000,\n\n345\n00:20:03.206 --> 00:20:05.200\nI don't think it was prior to that.\n\n346\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.560\nBut there was a commercial\nof some type on where\n\n347\n00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.690\nyou see this guy sitting at his computer\nall night long and he's going click it,\n\n348\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.530\nclick it, click it, and he stops and he\ngoes, wow, I hit the end of the Internet.\n\n349\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.596\n>> I remember that commercial.\n\n350\n00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:19.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think it was for\n\n351\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.480\na high speed internet or something.\n\n352\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.180\n>> I think it was for Comcast or\nTime Warner or something.\n\n353\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.540\nAnyway, sorry about that.\n\n354\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.500\nWe digressed a little bit.\n\n355\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.750\nAnd then there are the database admins.\n\n356\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.930\nBlack magic, right?\n\n357\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.440\nDB admins.\n\n358\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.790\nYou don't wanna go around those guys.\n\n359\n00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.622\nThey're a whole nother crowd all unto-\n>> Don't you put that evil on me, Brian.\n\n360\n00:20:37.622 --> 00:20:39.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All unto themselves.\n\n361\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.390\nDatabase admins are just that.\n\n362\n00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.270\nThey're the ones that setup the tables,\nthey create tables and\n\n363\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.940\nrows, or tuples, if you will.\n\n364\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.320\nThey're the ones who create the roles and\npermissions etcetera, etcetera.\n\n365\n00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.190\nThey're also the ones who accidentally\nsometimes leave the SA password blank,\n\n366\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.540\nwe won't go into that.\n\n367\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.160\nAnd then there are, and this is an\ninteresting one you need to remember for\n\n368\n00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.840\nthe exam wink, wink,\nthere's the computer operator.\n\n369\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.050\nThe computer operator is not Daniel.\n\n370\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.940\nDaniel is a computer operator but not in\nthe context of what we're talking about.\n\n371\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.910\nThat's the person who works with\nthe database admin to do the actual,\n\n372\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.670\nit's sort of like the analysts.\n\n373\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.510\nThey help the server DB admin\ndo their jobs properly.\n\n374\n00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.701\nAnd then there's the system\nanalyst who works with end users\n\n375\n00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:34.070\nto develop requirements for\nthe application as time changes.\n\n376\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.530\nThen there's the actual data entry staff,\nthe people who actually do the data entry.\n\n377\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.530\nFor instance, in an accounting\nsystem they may do the AP, or\n\n378\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.040\naccounts payable or AR for\naccounts receivable, etcetera.\n\n379\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.490\nYears and years ago back in the 90s,\n\n380\n00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.620\nI worked with a plastic manufacturing\ncompany and they did exactly that.\n\n381\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.900\nThey had a controller and\nthen they had two separate people,\n\n382\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.910\nwho one person's job was totally AR,\nthe other person was AP.\n\n383\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.820\nAnd their jobs,\n\n384\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.340\nthey were kept separate, they were not\nallowed to talk to each other, they\n\n385\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.120\ndidn't know anything about the accounts to\nprevent any kind of fraud from occurring.\n\n386\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.220\nThey were not big enough to, I've\nmentioned this before in some companies\n\n387\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.700\nthat actually rotate the people through\nand rotate the jobs so that they can't see\n\n388\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.590\nand they never know who's coming\nup next to look at their records.\n\n389\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.920\n>> To keep the shell game moving.\n\n390\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.440\n>> To keep to insure,\nbecause there's a lot of money at stake,\n\n391\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.870\nit's not very difficult to crack\nthrough some of that stuff.\n\n392\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.250\nAnd then there's the old media librarian.\n\n393\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:39.801\nAnd that's not the little old lady who\nhands out fines for not returning a tape.\n\n394\n00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:45.180\n[LAUGH] The old media librarian\nis the person whose charged with\n\n395\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:50.530\ntaking care of and managing all\nthe backup media for the organization\n\n396\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:55.590\nto insure that if a change were to go\nsouth or someone were to lose data files,\n\n397\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.180\netcetera, that that information could\nbe very readily or easily accessed.\n\n398\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.989\nThat's a much bigger job than you\nmight think in a large organization.\n\n399\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.710\nWhen you don't have virtual desktops so\nthat everything's on a single server,\n\n400\n00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.910\nor on a SAN.\n\n401\n00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.750\nWhen you have people like us walking\nlike cowboys with Macs everywhere and\n\n402\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.760\nPCs everywhere and\n\n403\n00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.000\nvirtual machines everywhere, you have no\nidea where your data is most of the time.\n\n404\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.810\nAnd if you don't have a media library and\nmaking sure that you have adequate backups\n\n405\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.740\nfor critical information then you're\nintroducing risk into the organization.\n\n406\n00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.100\nSo you need to make sure that you have\nsome type of media librarian function.\n\n407\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.120\nWhether that be a whole person's job or\nnot is another matter but\n\n408\n00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.310\nsomebody needs to be the media\nlibrarian for all of your backups, so\n\n409\n00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.340\nthat you have access to that\ninformation in an emergency.\n\n410\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:48.250\nAnd then last but not least is\nthe frontline help desk person.\n\n411\n00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.100\nThe person that takes the most abuse.\n\n412\n00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.618\n>> Been there.\n\n413\n00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:54.568\n>> Who has to understand all\nof these systems at least\n\n414\n00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:59.368\nto a certain level to be able to assist\nthe end user when they run into problems.\n\n415\n00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:00.663\n>> Is that what we were\nsupposed to be doing?\n\n416\n00:24:00.663 --> 00:24:01.410\n>> Yeah.\n\n417\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.066\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n418\n00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:06.900\na great example of this most recently,\nI really have to brag about this.\n\n419\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.860\nI'm doing a project with a rather\nlarge state government, and\n\n420\n00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.590\nI needed some help with my laptop\nthat they had issued for me.\n\n421\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.310\nAnd I wasn't really expecting a great\nexperience, but it's happened two or\n\n422\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.830\nthree times now, so\nI know it's system wide.\n\n423\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.580\nAbsolutely blew my mind away.\n\n424\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.940\nThey were so awesome to work with.\n\n425\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.560\nThey had all the tools they\nneeded at their fingertips.\n\n426\n00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.920\nThey were able to get what I\nneeded run through very quickly.\n\n427\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.250\nBecause some of the questions\nasked they weren't sure of.\n\n428\n00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.860\nCould I install a printer in\nmy home across their VPN?\n\n429\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.289\nHmm, let me check,\nI gotta ask my boss that real quick.\n\n430\n00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:44.122\nBoom, [SOUND] got it,\ngot my printers installed, ready to go.\n\n431\n00:24:44.122 --> 00:24:46.583\nSo a really top-notch organization.\n\n432\n00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.403\nI was really very impressed\nwith their help desk.\n\n433\n00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:51.527\n>> A good help desk is really\nworth its weight in gold.\n\n434\n00:24:51.527 --> 00:24:53.852\n>> Absolutely.\n>> As I got up and I left the help desk,\n\n435\n00:24:53.852 --> 00:24:58.222\nI started becoming a higher level of\nsupport and a systems administrator,\n\n436\n00:24:58.222 --> 00:24:58.881\n>> Right.\n\n437\n00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:01.681\n>> And just dealing with other help\ndesks and how much they really just\n\n438\n00:25:01.681 --> 00:25:05.043\nwant to pass the buck and make it,\nit's your fault, it's your computer.\n\n439\n00:25:05.043 --> 00:25:06.213\nCan't help you, sorry about that.\n\n440\n00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:06.718\n>> Yeah, reboot [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:25:06.718 --> 00:25:08.800\n>> And I'm like,\nlet's revisit this there really quickly.\n\n442\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.160\n>> Yeah, or they wanna do this thing.\n\n443\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.900\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nthey'll do this number right there, yeah.\n\n444\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.136\n>> The hardware and the software guys.\n\n445\n00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:14.404\nWell you must have installed something\non your machine we don't support.\n\n446\n00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:16.145\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n447\n00:25:16.145 --> 00:25:17.129\n>> Yeah, one of those.\n\n448\n00:25:17.129 --> 00:25:22.062\nSo anyway, so that's the list of\nfolks who are involved in this\n\n449\n00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:26.760\nsystem acquisition development and\nimplementation.\n\n450\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.280\nIt's important that you have some\nfundamental understanding of\n\n451\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.584\nthose different roles and\nhow they play into all this.\n\n452\n00:25:31.584 --> 00:25:35.990\nAnd I think you're beginning to see\nthat there's this gigantic wheel and\n\n453\n00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.120\nthere's all these little gears, and\nthat's what we've been trying to\n\n454\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.490\ntalk about in each of these sessions,\nis try to break it down into livable,\n\n455\n00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.250\nuseable chunks of gears that make\nthat big system run efficiently,\n\n456\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:52.450\nat a level of risk that\nthe organization can tolerate,\n\n457\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.190\nand reaches its strategic goals and\nobjectives.\n\n458\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.250\n>> That's excellent stuff.\n\n459\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.510\nAnd it's definitely things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n460\n00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.160\nWe have to have these\nfundamental concepts and\n\n461\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.950\nideas underneath our belts, in our tool\nkits, because if we don't then, A,\n\n462\n00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.670\nwe're gonna have a hard time\non this exam most likely.\n\n463\n00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.879\nAnd B, it's just helpful for\nus in our actual day to day environments.\n\n464\n00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:15.451\nAs an auditor, when you're going\nout there, if you don't understand\n\n465\n00:26:15.451 --> 00:26:18.605\nthe different roles that are being\nplayed in the IT structure,\n\n466\n00:26:18.605 --> 00:26:22.594\nthen you're gonna have a hard time\npinpointing who's responsible for what and\n\n467\n00:26:22.594 --> 00:26:25.959\nthen you're not gonna be able to\nmake sense of the spaghetti mess,\n\n468\n00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:26.888\n>> That's right.\n\n469\n00:26:26.888 --> 00:26:29.351\n>> That can be an IT house or\nshop [LAUGH].\n\n470\n00:26:29.351 --> 00:26:30.628\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n471\n00:26:30.628 --> 00:26:32.354\n>> Well Brian, we do thank you for\nunraveling that mess for\n\n472\n00:26:32.354 --> 00:26:32.997\nus,\n>> You're welcome.\n\n473\n00:26:32.997 --> 00:26:36.698\n>> And giving some more insight into that\nfor ourselves, so we can use that and\n\n474\n00:26:36.698 --> 00:26:37.785\npass the exam.\n\n475\n00:26:37.785 --> 00:26:40.680\nDon't forget guys, pick up the CISA book.\n\n476\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.210\nOne of the authors sitting right here,\n\n477\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.630\ngiving you the lowdown on\nwhat is inside of here.\n\n478\n00:26:44.630 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.880\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and\n\n4\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.220\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.050\nAnd joining me back in the studio is one\nof the authors of this fine CISA study\n\n6\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.950\nguide that we were using throughout the\nshow, is our good friend Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n7\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.750\nBrian, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.529\nHow's it going today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:34.240\n>> Hi Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.630\n>> Going well, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.190\nAppreciate you having me back on.\n\n12\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050\nIn this episode today I would like\nto talk about something near and\n\n13\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.880\ndear to my heart which\nis change management.\n\n14\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.590\n>> Cue the scary music right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.500\n>> Yeah, do, do, do, do.\n\n16\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.020\nThe what is that the dun.\n\n17\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.310\n>> Dun dun dun.\n\n18\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.240\n>> Yeah, in the previous episode,\nI talked about the different roles or\n\n19\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.790\nthe titles of the role of the different\npeople that are involved in\n\n20\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.880\nthe system acquisition, development and\nimplementation processes.\n\n21\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.670\nAnd in this episode,\nI'd like to talk a little bit about, or\n\n22\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.980\nextensively about change management,\nin terms of once the systems have\n\n23\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.770\nbeen implemented, some of this applies\nduring a process, but more so after\n\n24\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.670\nthe systems have been implemented, about\nhow important change management can be.\n\n25\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.470\nAnd I may tap you in a minute to talk\nabout the story we were discussing\n\n26\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.870\noffline a few minutes ago\nin terms of your first,\n\n27\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.000\nmore of your first experiences\nwith change management.\n\n28\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.320\nSo what I'd like to talk a little bit\nabout is change managements boards or\n\n29\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.840\ncommittees.\n\n30\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.510\nDepending on the organization,\nyou may hear them called change\n\n31\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.790\nmanagement boards or change boards,\nor change committees.\n\n32\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.200\nDoesn't matter what you call it,\nthe purpose of that\n\n33\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.940\nparticular group is to do two or\nthree things.\n\n34\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.110\nOne of which is configuration control.\n\n35\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.880\nAnd, excuse me, the reason why I say\nconfiguration control is because\n\n36\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.350\nwhen you bring a new system online,\n\n37\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.290\nand it's configured properly,\nyou don't wanna make changes to that\n\n38\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.180\nsystem without going through a process\nto vet the changes, or you could\n\n39\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.290\nintroduce more risk into the organization\nwithout anyone ever knowing it.\n\n40\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.330\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n41\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.010\nThat's something that you\nwant to avoid at all costs.\n\n42\n00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.000\nSo, configuration control\n\n43\n00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.130\nis vital in maintaining the risk\nprofile of the organization.\n\n44\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.329\nEven something as simple as\nchanging a parameter on passwords,\n\n45\n00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.265\nsomething that may seem fairly simple.\n\n46\n00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:47.425\nI noticed an, we'll switch gears and\ntalk about it,\n\n47\n00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:52.165\nan application error that occurred\nabout a year ago I believe it was.\n\n48\n00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:54.220\nMaybe a year and a half ago, or two.\n\n49\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.730\nIt had to with iPhone IOS.\n\n50\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.970\nIt had to do with, if you recall, there\nwas a vulnerability that was only there\n\n51\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.270\nfor about four or five days but somebody\ndiscovered that in the code of the IOS\n\n52\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.190\nthere was a missing carriage\nreturn next to a semicolon.\n\n53\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.960\nOne simple little change that happened\nin the IOS that happened in the IOS\n\n54\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.990\nthat didn't get caught in\nthe change management process.\n\n55\n00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.410\nI believe it was version 8.7 or\nsomething like that, but\n\n56\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.489\nit would cause your phone to\nreboot if you did a certain thing.\n\n57\n00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.660\nIf you texted or it was some\ncharacter sequence that you could\n\n58\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.930\ntext to the phone and\nit would cause the phone to reboot.\n\n59\n00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.810\nApple fixed it very quickly,\nbut it's kind of funny because\n\n60\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.940\nit was simply a carriage return I believe\nor something like or something like that.\n\n61\n00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.230\nA space missing in\na piece of the base code.\n\n62\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.259\n>> Reminds me of back in the days when\nwe used [INAUDIBLE] telephone systems.\n\n63\n00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.248\n>> Right.\n>> It was the tones that were interpreted\n\n64\n00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:47.108\nby the phone itself.\n\n65\n00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:49.473\nAnd people would get that\nCaptain Crunch whistle and\n\n66\n00:03:49.473 --> 00:03:51.260\nit whistled at 2600 [INAUDIBLE].\n\n67\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.250\n>> Right.\n>> You'd walk by a phone bank and\n\n68\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.593\nblow that whistle and they'd all hang up.\n\n69\n00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:56.724\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:58.290\nExactly.\nThings like that.\n\n71\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.980\nSo, configuration control is just one\nof the functions of change management.\n\n72\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.660\nI wanna talk a little bit about\nthe composition of the change management\n\n73\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.020\nboard, because I've seen change\nmanagement committees or\n\n74\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.890\nCABs as they're oftentimes called,\n\n75\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.610\nin that, I've seen them done very broadly,\n\n76\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.080\nI've seen them done very narrowly,\nand I've seen them not done at all,\n\n77\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.180\nand I've seen them done to the point\nwhere they drive people crazy cuz it's so\n\n78\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860\nhard to get any kind of a change made\nthat people oftentimes will just simply\n\n79\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.580\neither go around the change control,\nnot follow a policies and procedures and\n\n80\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.445\nbecause there have not been adequate\ncontrols to keep that from occurring,\n\n81\n00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:45.370\nthat'-s actually an audit finding\n\n82\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.690\nthat someone could go around\nthe controls without getting caught.\n\n83\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.830\nAnd also to the point where they're so\n\n84\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.970\nsloppy that really nobody\nknows what's going on.\n\n85\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.970\nPeople just approve them,\ncheck, check, check.\n\n86\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.830\nThat can often happen in an organization.\n\n87\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.070\nThere's one I'm working with now where,\nexcuse me, they're doing somewhere in\n\n88\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.490\nthe range of, I've seen on a busy day,\nthey might do 30 change requests.\n\n89\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.010\nThat's a lot, on a daily basis,\neven for a big organization.\n\n90\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.520\nYou're nodding your head yes.\n\n91\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd when I talked to them, they're like,\nwell, that's just normal for us.\n\n92\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.930\nI'm like, well, but it's not normal for\nthe rest of the world.\n\n93\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.100\nAnd what I discovered is that\nthey're running their application\n\n94\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.990\nchange management through\nthe same board that they're doing\n\n95\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.760\nall of the entire company's\nchange management through.\n\n96\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.210\nThen because they're an application\ndevelopment company,\n\n97\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.270\nthat obviously involves a lot of changes,\nso in their particular instance,\n\n98\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.770\nI strongly suggested that they break\nthe change boards into multiple boards so\n\n99\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.280\nthat what would happen would be they\nmight get 30 or 40 sometimes in a day\n\n100\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.630\nmainframe code changes to change\na field from yes to no or from 0 to 1.\n\n101\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.090\nI mean these tiny little minutia things,\n\n102\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.450\nbut to a database programmer and\nto a mainframe programmer\n\n103\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.190\nyou don't do anything without\ngoing through a changed process.\n\n104\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.090\nBecause it could have repercussions\nin the financial side of things.\n\n105\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.050\nSo they're getting just flooded with\nall these mainframe changes, and\n\n106\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.640\nso what happens is when\na security issue pops up,\n\n107\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.530\nor a sort of a normal operational\nissue pops up, you kind of get numb.\n\n108\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.075\nIt's like having Department of\nHomeland Security alerts on red forever.\n\n109\n00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:29.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, pretty soon,\n\n110\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.670\nyou just go, yeah right, whatever.\n\n111\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.470\nYou don't pay any attention to it.\n\n112\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.180\nAnd that's how accidents happen and\nthings slip through the process.\n\n113\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.710\n>> Yeah, it's like turning the alerts up\non your exchange server, or something.\n\n114\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.660\n>> Right.\n>> To the maximum.\n\n115\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.240\nYou're getting alerts about everything,\nand suddenly you're, okay,\n\n116\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.850\nI'm just gonna run Outlook rules this,\nsend all this to the trash.\n\n117\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.647\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:48.647 --> 00:06:49.148\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n119\n00:06:49.148 --> 00:06:49.994\n>> And the server's on fire. And.\n\n120\n00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:51.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n121\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.360\nSo finding a good balance in\nyour change of management\n\n122\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.860\nactivities is extremely important\nbecause change management\n\n123\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.490\nis almost always where I see\nproblems creep into the mix.\n\n124\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.260\nVendor management and change\nmanagement are the two biggest areas\n\n125\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.090\noutside of things you can't control like\nphishing attacks and stuff like that in\n\n126\n00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.570\nterms of introducing vulnerabilities and\nrisk into the organization.\n\n127\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.310\nVendor management through\npoor vendor selection,\n\n128\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.360\nthrough poor vendor monitoring\netc those kinds of things.\n\n129\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.500\nAnd in change management primarily\nthrough not properly vetting and\n\n130\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.480\nmanaging those changes.\n\n131\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.030\nSo let's talk a little bit more\nabout who's involved in that.\n\n132\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.960\nOne of the things that I have stressed\nin every organization I work with,\n\n133\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.300\nagain because as most of you know,\n\n134\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.010\nif you've been watching I have a strong\nsecurity background as well as audit.\n\n135\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.350\nAnd that is that security have a voice\nat any of those boards because any and\n\n136\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.640\nall of those changes could\nhave an impact on security for\n\n137\n00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.442\nthe organization which\ntranslates into risk.\n\n138\n00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:57.746\nAnd that's what we're all about,\nas auditors and audit functions,\n\n139\n00:07:57.746 --> 00:07:58.647\nis managing risk.\n\n140\n00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:01.918\nYou'll hear that over and over and\nover, not only from me, But\n\n141\n00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:05.622\nthroughout the CISA study materials,\nyou'll see it on your exam, and\n\n142\n00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:08.670\nyou're gonna run into it when\nyou get into the business.\n\n143\n00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.920\nWe're no longer a check box function\njust to see that we're doing things for\n\n144\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.080\nthe sake of doing them.\n\n145\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.020\nIt's really about reducing and\nmanaging risk to manageable levels for\n\n146\n00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.709\nthe organization.\n\n147\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.610\nSo you've got a security officer,\nyou may have a network change board\n\n148\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.260\nwhere any changes to the route\nswitch environment are involved.\n\n149\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.880\nYou probably ought to keep it\nto just those people involved.\n\n150\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.870\nThe IT manager, or excuse me,\nthe route switch manager for\n\n151\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.830\nthat area, people who understand\nwhat their technicians are doing but\n\n152\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.840\nyou don't necessarily want a technician\nin the room arguing their case.\n\n153\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.660\nWell, excuse me, deciding their case.\n\n154\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.190\nThat's another part of the change\nmanagement process we will talk about,\n\n155\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.810\nwhich is number one,\n\n156\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.852\nproper documentation, whether you\nare using SharePoint or spreadsheets.\n\n157\n00:08:59.852 --> 00:09:02.940\nOr, there are change management\napplications that you can buy.\n\n158\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.390\nA lot of companies will use their\nhelpdesk ticketing software\n\n159\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.970\nto manage change management, so\nthat they have an ongoing audit trail.\n\n160\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.060\nWink, wink.\n\n161\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.130\nTest question.\n\n162\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.120\nSo, that they have an ongoing audit\ntrail of all of their changes.\n\n163\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.530\nSo, if something were to occur a week or\ntwo weeks or\n\n164\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.430\nthree weeks down the road, they could\npossibly have forensic information\n\n165\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.020\nabout when the change occured and\nwhat exactly occurred.\n\n166\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.585\nAnd why it was asked, who asked for it.\n\n167\n00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:35.715\nMaybe it's an insider job and you've got\nsomebody who sliped something through in\n\n168\n00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:39.196\nthe change management board that\nwould elevate their permissions and\n\n169\n00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:42.730\nallow them to do something that\nmight benefit them financially.\n\n170\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.320\nSomething like that.\n\n171\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.330\nAllow them to get into accounts that\nthey should not have access to.\n\n172\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.880\nSo in an application change management\nboard, the network guys are gonna,\n\n173\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.491\nthey're gonna do this.\n\n174\n00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.154\n[SOUND].\n\n175\n00:09:57.154 --> 00:10:01.074\nSo, do you really want them in your\napplication change management?\n\n176\n00:10:01.074 --> 00:10:04.435\nAgain, security person,\nhaving a security analyst or\n\n177\n00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:08.750\na security person at those\nmeetings is very useful as well.\n\n178\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.270\nThe frequency, in my opinion,\nonce a day's too much, but again,\n\n179\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.040\nthe one organization I mentioned I was\nworking with, they feel it's necessary.\n\n180\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.160\nThey don't wanna break it up,\nthey like it.\n\n181\n00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.370\nThey come in every morning,\nit's the very first thing they do and\n\n182\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.810\nthen they go finish their day, and they've\nbeen doing it that way for a long time.\n\n183\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.670\nAnd it seems to work for them, but\ngenerally, if you're doing daily changes,\n\n184\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.350\nsomething's wrong.\n\n185\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.915\nHere's my take on that,\n\n186\n00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:38.468\nthis is not on the exam this is just\ngood practical knowledge and that is,\n\n187\n00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:46.678\nTypically when you're doing\nchanges on a daily basis,\n\n188\n00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:50.842\npeople tend to wait to the last minute\nto ask for them, to submit them,\n\n189\n00:10:50.842 --> 00:10:55.460\nwhich means you have very little time\nto review them adequately and vet them.\n\n190\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.120\nThat's a dangerous mix.\n\n191\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.840\nThat's asking for\nerrors to creep into the process.\n\n192\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.200\nBut it happens quite often.\n\n193\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.012\nSomeone will come up to\nyou at the last minute,\n\n194\n00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:07.140\nI just gotta have this done tomorrow or\ntonight.\n\n195\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.970\nI gotta get this approved,\nlet me get in front of the cab today.\n\n196\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.800\nWell if you have changes like that,\nyou should have an emergency change\n\n197\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.990\nprocess in place to be able to\nhandle those kinds of things.\n\n198\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.700\nThose should not be going through the\ngeneral channels of your change management\n\n199\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.820\nactivities for obvious reasons.\n\n200\n00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.580\nYou want to know that it's an emergency or\n\n201\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.650\nyou've got somebody who's\ncrying wolf all the time.\n\n202\n00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.310\nAnd that's most of the time,\nthat's what it turns out to be.\n\n203\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.676\nYou got an employee, or a staff group,\n\n204\n00:11:32.676 --> 00:11:35.750\nwho's just simply used\nto getting their way.\n\n205\n00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.780\nThey don't plan their work out so\nthat they turn in requests in\n\n206\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.860\nan adequate timeframe so that everyone\nhas a chance to review and vet them.\n\n207\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:51.140\nSo typically, in most organizations\nI've worked with cabs meet once a week,\n\n208\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.760\nand, all the stuff piles up.\n\n209\n00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.212\nThere's still some late-nighters\nwho come in at the last minute and\n\n210\n00:11:56.212 --> 00:11:58.484\nthey don't tell you\nuntil the night before.\n\n211\n00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:03.525\nBut the point is, you should always take\nthe time necessary to vet those requests,\n\n212\n00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:07.640\nand if you don't have enough\ntime in the meeting, table it.\n\n213\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.260\nAnd tell them flat out,\nyou didn't get it to us in time or\n\n214\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.960\nyou didn't provide us enough information\nto make a good decision about it.\n\n215\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.110\n>> Now Bryan, other than just vetting\nthe change requests that are coming across\n\n216\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.210\nthe board, what else happens\ninside of these meetings?\n\n217\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.340\nWhat are some of the typical change\nrequests, committee or board?\n\n218\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.980\n>> Yeah, so here's an example of\none that happened in a healthcare\n\n219\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.500\norganization I worked\nwith a couple years ago.\n\n220\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.550\n>> I was the only security person\nsitting in on the meeting at that time.\n\n221\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.070\nThey did not have that\nrole in the organization.\n\n222\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.970\nAnd I was asked to come in and\naudit and make recommendations,\n\n223\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.370\ndo an assessment of the process.\n\n224\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.630\nAnd during the conversation\none of the networking\n\n225\n00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.670\nteam brought up that they had\nadded a new vendor to the VPN,\n\n226\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.850\nwho had then had gained\naccess to their systems\n\n227\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.530\nbecause they needed to\nshare some information.\n\n228\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.260\nI cannot give you anymore\ndetails than that.\n\n229\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.759\nAnd I said, number one,\nwho vetted the vendor?\n\n230\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.734\nNo one could answer that question.\n\n231\n00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:14.572\nNumber two, I said, did they sign\na business associate agreement,\n\n232\n00:13:14.572 --> 00:13:19.150\nwhich is a requirement under the EMPA\nregulations, and no one could answer that.\n\n233\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.508\nAnd then I said, do they have access to\nPII, Personally Identifiable Information,\n\n234\n00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:28.772\nor healthcare information,\nanything sensitive?\n\n235\n00:13:28.772 --> 00:13:30.450\nNo one could answer that.\n\n236\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.720\nSo of course I sent to the boss and\n\n237\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.000\nI said, I think you kind of ran through\na change you ought to take a hard look at.\n\n238\n00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.220\nSo it really wasn't properly vetted.\n\n239\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.450\nThose are the kinds of\nconversations that happen.\n\n240\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.330\nBut in addition to that,\nwe'll see things like, we'll\n\n241\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.850\nsee a network manager\nsubmit an application\n\n242\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.820\nfor a firewall change that someone in\nthe committee does not quite understand.\n\n243\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.250\nSo we may get them on the phone, or ask\nthem to come down to the meeting room, and\n\n244\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.050\nsay, can you give us some more\ndetails about what this really means,\n\n245\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.990\nbecause we do not quite\nunderstand your description.\n\n246\n00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.710\nSo they might come in, or they might even\nbe required to appear before the board\n\n247\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.985\nto make their case that it's\nan important change and explain it.\n\n248\n00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:19.250\nOftentimes, folks are too busy to stop\nwhat they're doing and come in and\n\n249\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.000\ndo that so they typically\nwrite that up in the request.\n\n250\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.870\nBut sometimes they don't do a very good\njob of explaining it, so they have to come\n\n251\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.910\ndown and actually make their case in\nfront of the change management board.\n\n252\n00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.130\nThen the change management board will\ndiscuss it, they'll decide well,\n\n253\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.130\ndoes it meet our criteria?\n\n254\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.701\nWhat is the impact going to be?\n\n255\n00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:42.603\nOne of the most important things is,\nthe questions to ask,\n\n256\n00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:45.920\nhave you tested this change before?\n\n257\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.520\nNot every organization\nhas a test environment.\n\n258\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.250\nThose are expensive and\ntime consuming and require staff.\n\n259\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.500\nSo not everybody has the ability to\ntest every single change that they wanna\n\n260\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.754\npush out to make sure that it works.\n\n261\n00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:02.555\nBut it's still a good question for\nyou to ask, have you tested this?\n\n262\n00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:05.527\nHave you done any kind of mock-up or\n\n263\n00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:10.835\nsimulation to gauge any kind of idea\nof what the impact might be of this?\n\n264\n00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:11.705\nOr is there no impact?\n\n265\n00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:15.155\nIs this something new that won't\nchange anything that we currently do?\n\n266\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.364\nSo those are some of the questions\nthat are asked in those situations.\n\n267\n00:15:22.364 --> 00:15:26.411\nAnd then most importantly, the single\nmost important thing you need to\n\n268\n00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:30.391\nknow about when you're in those\ncommittees is asking for adequate and\n\n269\n00:15:30.391 --> 00:15:35.690\nproper documentation on how to back out\nthe process if something goes awry.\n\n270\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.619\nI can't tell you how many times\neveryone has vetted the change,\n\n271\n00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:44.131\nit looks like it's absolutely golden,\nthey test it in the environment,\n\n272\n00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:47.364\nthey push it out, and\nit burns and crashes big time.\n\n273\n00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.543\nAnd the CEO's on the phone, he's yelling.\n\n274\n00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:51.601\nMaybe you're on the front\npage of the newspaper.\n\n275\n00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:52.494\n>> That's a fun time.\n\n276\n00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:53.910\n>> Who knows what, right?\n\n277\n00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.853\nAnd you have to be able to\nback those changes out.\n\n278\n00:15:56.853 --> 00:16:03.517\nSo, it's not good enough to just say,\nwhat's your roll back?\n\n279\n00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:06.043\nOr once you roll back, procedures,\n\n280\n00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:09.650\nwhat have you got in place\nto roll back the change?\n\n281\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.070\nHave you tested that?\n\n282\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.820\nHave you tested the,\ncuz the rollback might not work.\n\n283\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.640\nWhat if the break that you introduced\nis so bad that you can't roll it back?\n\n284\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.750\nNow what are you gonna do?\n\n285\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.050\nDo you have a backup of the system?\n\n286\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.210\nIs it a virtual machine?\n\n287\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.566\nCan you make a snap shot of it?\n\n288\n00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:28.520\nJust in case, so that worst case scenario,\nmaybe we lose five minutes worth of data.\n\n289\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.521\nIf this is an e-commerce\nsite,that can cost you a lot\n\n290\n00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.532\nof money if your doing things\nfrom all over the world.\n\n291\n00:16:34.532 --> 00:16:40.342\nWhat happens if someone here from ITProTV\nmakes a change to the video encoding and\n\n292\n00:16:40.342 --> 00:16:44.110\nall of the sudden, boom,\nour video feed goes dead?\n\n293\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.840\nWhat does that do to the business?\n\n294\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.150\nHow can you roll that back?\n\n295\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.197\n>> I'm pretty sure that Don just\nkicks in the door with a rifle.\n\n296\n00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:52.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And starts holding hostages.\n\n297\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.540\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n298\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.050\nSo you can see how really critically\nimportant change management\n\n299\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.720\nbecomes in the overall\noperation of managing systems.\n\n300\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.530\nNow like I said, we talked a little\nbit about using change management\n\n301\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.350\nduring the app development lifecycle, but\n\n302\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.880\nagain, things like Agile have\na tendency to kind of bypass that.\n\n303\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.670\nCuz they're more interested in\ngetting the application delivered,\n\n304\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.630\ndoes it meet the end user's needs, ect.\n\n305\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.890\nThey're not so concerned about\nmeeting the change processes, etc.\n\n306\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.200\nSo, they may very well, and very easily,\nthey may go through a number of changes\n\n307\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.270\nwithout ever coming to the change\nboard in the development cycle.\n\n308\n00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.480\nThey do their changes at their, what they\ncall, their morning stand-up meetings,\n\n309\n00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.740\nthings like that, they'll share that\nkind of information with each other.\n\n310\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.090\n>> Yeah, like we were talking about,\n\n311\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:48.560\nyou mentioned that we were\nconversing before this episode and\n\n312\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.570\nmy first foray into having to deal\nwith a change management system was\n\n313\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.865\nwhen I worked for an insurance company,\nI've mentioned that on other shows.\n\n314\n00:17:56.865 --> 00:18:00.880\nAnd people would call me up or\nemail me and say, I need you to do this.\n\n315\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.040\nI need you to do that and\nI thought, well okay.\n\n316\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.960\nMy job is to do the things\npeople ask we to do and\n\n317\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.230\nsince I have responsibilities over them,\nthat's what I'll do.\n\n318\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.420\nSo that's what I was doing,\nnext thing I know I'm in an office going,\n\n319\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.770\nwhy are you not filling out\nyour change management form?\n\n320\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.571\nI said, I am.\n\n321\n00:18:17.571 --> 00:18:19.317\nI'm doing the work that's\nrequested of me and\n\n322\n00:18:19.317 --> 00:18:21.280\nI'm filling out the change\nmanagement forms.\n\n323\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.140\nI didn't understand that it was,\nyou have to have the request submitted,\n\n324\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.050\nthen approved.\n\n325\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.357\nIt goes through maybe a committee.\n\n326\n00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:31.480\nMaybe there's a single individual\nthat does the approving.\n\n327\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.020\nThere's a manager that does this.\n\n328\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.690\nAnd then you do the work, and\nthen you fill out that the work was done.\n\n329\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.460\nAnd what was the end\nresult of these things.\n\n330\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.440\nIt's a lot of a process.\n\n331\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.000\nAnd I just didn't realize these things.\n\n332\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.630\nAnd after that, I was change management.\n\n333\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.270\nSo once I realized what went into it and\nwhy it was happening,\n\n334\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.230\nit kept me out of the office and\ngetting scolded.\n\n335\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.370\nI was not getting-\n>> Right.\n\n336\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.060\n>> A finger wagging.\n\n337\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.420\n>> Right.\n>> That was always nice.\n\n338\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.480\nI told Brian, I said, I wouldn't go to the\nbathroom without a change request form.\n\n339\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.240\nYou had to get a work order in\nfront of me everything after that.\n\n340\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.585\nCuz it does,\nit protects me as an employee.\n\n341\n00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:06.068\nI'm making sure that I'm doing exactly\nwhat it was that was asked of me and\n\n342\n00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:09.043\nwas approved, and that way,\nif anything goes wrong I can say,\n\n343\n00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:10.922\nwell here's the change request form.\n\n344\n00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:13.242\n>> Right.\n>> You can see that that is the job I did.\n\n345\n00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:17.020\nIt was approved,\nit was accepted as completed work.\n\n346\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.670\nI should be fine, this is not my fault.\n\n347\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.235\nSo, it helps you and\nthen it helps us in the audit trail,\n\n348\n00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:23.100\nlike we've been talking about as well.\n\n349\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.727\n>> Right.\n\n350\n00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:26.210\n>> If something does go wrong well,\nlet's find out where that happened.\n\n351\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.570\nWe see Daniel submitted the work it looks\nlike it was approved correctly, but\n\n352\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.830\nthis isn't what needed to be done so\n\n353\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.640\nthe problem wasn't with him it was with\nwho submitted the actual change itself.\n\n354\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.140\n>> Right, right, that a really good point.\n\n355\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.602\nAnd again, that's the whole\npoint of change management,\n\n356\n00:19:40.602 --> 00:19:45.100\nis to be able to develop an audit trail,\nto be able to backtrack when something\n\n357\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.340\ndoes go wrong because Murphy's Law\ncomes into play every single time.\n\n358\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.520\nIf it can go wrong, it will.\n\n359\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.450\nWe guarantee it.\n\n360\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.750\nWhether it's in, it could be that you've\ngot, here's another great example is,\n\n361\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.380\nyou just spent 50 or $60,000 on these\nbrand new monster blade servers for\n\n362\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.030\nrunning your virtualization environment.\n\n363\n00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.550\nYou turn them on and\nthe power supplies blow.\n\n364\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.470\nNow what do you do?\n\n365\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.920\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You cry.\n\n366\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.010\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n367\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.510\nDid you think when you bought those,\ndo you have backups,\n\n368\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.587\ndo you have extra copies of the power\nsupplies, those kinds of things?\n\n369\n00:20:17.587 --> 00:20:23.770\nSo it just goes to show you that Murphy's\nLaw, if anything can go wrong, it will.\n\n370\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.470\nSo, change management is right up there,\nlike I said, with vendor management.\n\n371\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.900\nIt is extremely important.\n\n372\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.090\nIt's a tiny little part of the exam.\n\n373\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:37.080\nYou've got the book in front of you,\nyou've got the ISOC website for resources.\n\n374\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.800\nBut I wanna make sure you have a good\nunderstanding of how important change\n\n375\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.070\nmanagement is in the real world in\nterms of what you're going to be doing\n\n376\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.410\nas an auditor on an ongoing basis.\n\n377\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.820\nYou've got to understand the process.\n\n378\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.260\nGoogle it, go to Google and\nlook up change management.\n\n379\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.340\nRead up on it as much as you can.\n\n380\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.450\nBecause regardless of how much is on\nthe exam you're going to see a lot\n\n381\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.880\nof it in the real world and\nyou're going to see\n\n382\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.970\na lot of the problems that you run into\ngo right back to change management.\n\n383\n00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.650\nOne last note I think I would probably put\nout there in terms of words of advice is\n\n384\n00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:15.930\nthat, typically, I'm real hardcore\nabout looking at root cause analysis.\n\n385\n00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.364\nPeople have a tendency to always go with\nwhat seems to be the simplest answer when\n\n386\n00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:21.568\nthere's a problem.\n\n387\n00:21:21.568 --> 00:21:25.070\nLike we were joking earlier,\nthe Internet's down.\n\n388\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.140\nNo, the Internet's not down.\n\n389\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.732\nYou may not be able to get to it,\nbut the Internet itself is still up.\n\n390\n00:21:29.732 --> 00:21:32.354\nI'm quite sure of that,\nunless there's been a very,\n\n391\n00:21:32.354 --> 00:21:35.328\nvery large EMP disaster somewhere\nthat we don't know about.\n\n392\n00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:36.071\n>> Very large.\n\n393\n00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:37.440\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n394\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.850\nSo when you do real root cause analysis,\nprobably 80% of the time,\n\n395\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.100\nmaybe 90% of the time, change management.\n\n396\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.550\nIt goes right back to there.\n\n397\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.990\nI will go, if there's a system that\ngoes haywire or something I find in\n\n398\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.080\nan audit that's showing me some\nsomething funny, I'm gonna go right\n\n399\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.440\nback to the change management logs and try\nto find out when that system was changed,\n\n400\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.840\nbecause I know that, typically,\npeople don't design things to go haywire.\n\n401\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.160\nThat happens when someone changes\nsomething without telling somebody else.\n\n402\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.430\nSo, and then, the last thing I'd say is\nwhat happens when you don't follow good\n\n403\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.850\nchange management is you lose.\n\n404\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.980\nAnd the students have heard me\nsay this throughout the series.\n\n405\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.960\nYou lose visibility into your risk.\n\n406\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.490\nBecause now you've introduced things\nthat you don't know are there.\n\n407\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.910\n>> Right, you've obfuscated it.\n\n408\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.450\n>> Exactly.\n\n409\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.730\nAnd any time you don't have visibility,\nyou have risk.\n\n410\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.840\nAnd risk is something we want\nto definitely at least mitigate.\n\n411\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.482\nWe can't avoid it, it's always there.\n\n412\n00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:34.005\n>> We wanna manage it.\n\n413\n00:22:34.005 --> 00:22:34.843\n>> Right, we wanna manage it.\n\n414\n00:22:34.843 --> 00:22:36.310\nThere we go, I like that better.\n\n415\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.280\nI'd like to mitigate it\nif I possibly could,\n\n416\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.160\nbut that's probably not going to happen.\n\n417\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.710\nManage it down to something that\nwe are able to tolerate, right?\n\n418\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.230\n>> Right.\nRight.\n\n419\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.080\n>> That's what we want to do.\n\n420\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.300\n>> Get it within our risk profile.\n\n421\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.710\n>> That's right, within our risk profile.\n\n422\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.190\nThat being said, well, we talked a lot\nabout change management today, and\n\n423\n00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.743\nhopefully, you guys are seeing\nthe importance of it,\n\n424\n00:22:54.743 --> 00:22:57.950\nthat you're seeing that it's not just\nsomething that's, it's just the red tape\n\n425\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.880\nthat you have to go through to make\nsure that things are getting done.\n\n426\n00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.600\nAnd yes, can it be a bit of a pain?\n\n427\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.110\nIt can.\n\n428\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.805\nYou gotta fill things out, you gotta\nmake sure that they've been submitted\n\n429\n00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:10.287\ncorrectly, and\nthat they've been approved, and\n\n430\n00:23:10.287 --> 00:23:13.310\nthen all the other beurocratic type of-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n431\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.888\n>> Things that we think of when it come to\n\n432\n00:23:15.888 --> 00:23:19.796\nchange management, but\nit really does help us out, and\n\n433\n00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:24.891\nit keeps you as the person that's\nworking within a system accountable.\n\n434\n00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:28.260\nYou can say,\nI did exactly what I said I was gonna do.\n\n435\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.010\nHere's all the things, it's right there.\n\n436\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.898\nAnybody is gonna see it,\nand it will help you.\n\n437\n00:23:31.898 --> 00:23:34.420\nTrust me,\nI'm speaking from experience on this.\n\n438\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.880\nWhen these guys come around, going,\nwhat is it that you did here?\n\n439\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.100\nLet me take a look at that.\n\n440\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.180\nYou can say, okay,\neverything I did was in the realm of-\n\n441\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.920\n>> Prove it.\n\n442\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.160\n>> Yeah, and I can prove it.\n\n443\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.860\nCuz there it is in my\nchange management log.\n\n444\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.380\n>> Right.\n\n445\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.140\n>> That's what I like.\n\n446\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.650\nSo hopefully,\nyou guys see the importance of it as well.\n\n447\n00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.415\nThat being said,\nwe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n448\n00:23:52.415 --> 00:23:55.900\nBryan, thanks so much for explaining how\nimportant change management is to us and\n\n449\n00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.190\nwhat we can expect when dealing\nwith it in our own environments.\n\n450\n00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.887\nGuys, don't forget to pick up\na copy of this CISA Study Guide.\n\n451\n00:24:02.887 --> 00:24:05.755\nIt is the Fourth Edition,\nremember, Fourth Edition.\n\n452\n00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:06.990\nBryan here is one of the authors.\n\n453\n00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.180\nIt is definitely going to help you,\nguide you through.\n\n454\n00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.970\nStudy Guide is the best\nword we could put on it.\n\n455\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:12.880\nI don't wanna say book.\n\n456\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.800\nIt really is a study guide\nto help you pass that exam.\n\n457\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.570\nGive you all the great knowledge you\nneed to get through that sucker.\n\n458\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.730\nCuz, as we understand, it's quite a bear.\n\n459\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.730\nSo, that being said, we've come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n460\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.080\nThank's Bryan again,\nwe thank you guys for watching.\n\n461\n00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n462\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.980\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n463\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.980\n>> And I'm Bryan O'Hara.\n\n464\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.094\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n465\n00:24:33.637 --> 00:24:41.180\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.580\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.660\nIn today's episode,\nwe're continuing on with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.190\nThat's right,\n\n6\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.540\njoining me in the studio today I've\ngot his lovely study guide right here.\n\n7\n00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.340\nIf you haven't grabbed one yet,\nyou definitely need a copy\n\n8\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.860\nof our Certified Information Systems\nAuditor Study Guide, fourth edition.\n\n9\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.940\nOne of the authors, it sounds similar,\nI'll go with it though,\n\n10\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.300\none of the authors right here with us,\nour good friend, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n11\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.900\nBrian, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n12\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.850\nHow is it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.650\n>> Good, thanks Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.630\nThanks for having me back again.\n\n15\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.160\nIn today's episode I would like\nto start by doing a little\n\n16\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.320\nbrief review of some of the things we've\ntalked about in the past few episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.590\nWe've talked a lot about frameworks,\ngovernance regulation.\n\n18\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.920\nWe've talked about the CMM model for\nmaturity.\n\n19\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.060\nWe've talked a little about the system\ndevelopment life cycle and/or software\n\n20\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.810\ndevelopment life cycle framework, and\n\n21\n00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.590\nwe've just barely touched\na little bit on ISO standards.\n\n22\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.950\nAnd today what I'd like to talk a little\nbit about as we move into domain four,\n\n23\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.281\nwhich is information systems, operations,\nmaintenance, and service management.\n\n24\n00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.230\nI wanna talk a little bit or\n\n25\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.580\nintroduce the concept of the IT\ninfrastructure library or ITIL.\n\n26\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.309\nITIL is an ISO ICE standard basically for,\n\n27\n00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:43.270\n[COUGH] excuse me, for helping service\norganizations understand the IT\n\n28\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.810\nenvironment in a way that they're able to\ndeliver support for those IT operations.\n\n29\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.550\nI've got a diagram here I'd like\nto pull up for you real quickly.\n\n30\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.960\nLet me get that up on the screen there.\n\n31\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.330\nI believe everyone can see that.\n\n32\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.990\nWhere you can see that you've\nheard these terms before.\n\n33\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.380\nCOSO, the,\nI'm forgetting the name of it now.\n\n34\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.710\n>> It's flying out of your head.\n\n35\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.505\n>> Of sponsoring organizations as COSO.\n\n36\n00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.619\nCOBIT being the Control Objectives for\nIT which is\n\n37\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.600\nISACA specific framework, and ISO 9000.\n\n38\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.700\nISO, and COSO, and COBIT all three again,\nas I mentioned before,\n\n39\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.872\nbeing internationally developed\n\n40\n00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:34.510\nsystems and concepts.\n\n41\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190\nISACA, I mentioned there's a bunch of\ntimes, ISACA is a worldwide organization.\n\n42\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.530\nWe have over 118,000 members\nworldwide in over 85 countries.\n\n43\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.370\nSo again, all of this comes from the work\nof many, many people across the globe.\n\n44\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.650\nThis is not a US based or\neven slightly US-centric\n\n45\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.030\norganization or set of frameworks.\n\n46\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.020\nSo we get really the best of both worlds,\nwe get all of the stuff that we've\n\n47\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.270\ndeveloped in the US over the last 30,\nor 40, or 50 years, combined with all\n\n48\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.960\nthe genius and brain work, and brain power\nfrom Europe and the rest of the world.\n\n49\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.020\nPrimarily from Europe, but\n\n50\n00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.830\nthere's a number of other organizations\ninvolved in this as well.\n\n51\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.630\nSo you can see that from this\ngreat ISACA document [LAUGH],\n\n52\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.850\nit's in our book, we put it in the book\nbut you'll see things like this referenced\n\n53\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.850\nin ISACA documentation, it's very complex\na little bit on the convoluted side but\n\n54\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.080\nif you just take a look at it for\na few minutes I won't burn your eyes out\n\n55\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.220\nwith it and leave it up during\nthe whole session today.\n\n56\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.370\nBut you'll see how things\nsort of interconnect.\n\n57\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.750\nThere's, you'll see,\nNIST 800, you see the ISO 20,\n\n58\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.740\nlet's see if I can highlight these, yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.049\nSo there's ISO 27002.\n\n60\n00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.800\nHere's the ITIL libraries over here,\nhere's NIST 800.\n\n61\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.090\nAnd you see how those all drive down\ninto user support for instance,\n\n62\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.490\nclear down to the service desk,\ndown to problem management for users, etc.\n\n63\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.020\nAnd down here you have the ITIL, which\ntargets lower level delivery to the user.\n\n64\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.050\nWhat's important for you to understand for\nthe exam and for the real world is to\n\n65\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.850\nhave an understanding and appreciation for\n\n66\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.260\nthe frame with the ITIL framework\nin terms of how it helps us or\n\n67\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260\nhow it helps IT organizations\ndelivers services to end users.\n\n68\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.170\nThose end users being not just the guy\nat the end of the keyboard, but\n\n69\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:44.290\nthe system administrator, the CIO, whoever\nmay need service delivery information.\n\n70\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.500\nOr, end user support, etc.\n\n71\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.340\nIt's a very important function\ninside the organization.\n\n72\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.990\nAnd it's good to have\na framework to work from.\n\n73\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.630\nI've seen service organizations, and I'll\ncall them service organizations meaning,\n\n74\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.590\ntypically what you're referring to is the\nhelp desk organization inside a company.\n\n75\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.850\nI've heard a number of them,\nor seen a number of them fail,\n\n76\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.490\nmiserably, because there is no framework\nassociated with what they're doing.\n\n77\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.560\nThey're just kind of flailing around in\nthe water, trying to accomplish something,\n\n78\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.160\nkeeping help desk tickets to a minimum,\nanswering questions as fast as they can.\n\n79\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.790\nBut there's really no\nstructured framework.\n\n80\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.794\nAs an auditor, that's one of the things\nthat you're expected to be able to\n\n81\n00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:33.390\nevaluate and understand, is to be\nable to go in to an organization and\n\n82\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.950\nlook at that framework, if any exists,\nand evaluate the effectiveness of it.\n\n83\n00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.930\nIs the organization using\na structured framework?\n\n84\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.150\nMaybe they are, and they don't know it.\n\n85\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.120\nOften times if you have a great\nservice manager, they're struggling\n\n86\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.410\ntrying to put something in place but\nthey don't know about other frameworks.\n\n87\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.570\nEspecially depending on\nthe size of the organization.\n\n88\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.020\nIf it's a bigger company,\n\n89\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.880\nchances are they've hired someone who has\nITIL certifications or background and\n\n90\n00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.290\nexperience, and they understand\nthe frameworks and how to implement them.\n\n91\n00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.420\nSo a number of things come into play,\nagain, that go way above and\n\n92\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.520\nbeyond just regular routine\nhelp desk kind of operations.\n\n93\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.490\nIn particular, in the previous episode\nwe talked about change management.\n\n94\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.370\nWell, in many organizations,\nthe service organization\n\n95\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.060\nis tasked with managing\nthose change request.\n\n96\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.920\nThey have what we would call\na ticketing system, for instance.\n\n97\n00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.290\nThere's dozens of companies out there\nthat do that, but they actually will use\n\n98\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.090\nthe ticketing system for plain old help\ndesk tickets like, I might submit a ticket\n\n99\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.150\nand say, I really don't understand why\nmy email does this when I'm on the VPN.\n\n100\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.420\nCan you help me?\n\n101\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.206\nAm I missing something or\ndoes there need to be a setting set up?\n\n102\n00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:59.560\nOr, maybe it's, I forgot to change my\napplication or my password excuse me,\n\n103\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.075\nto one of the internal applications and\nI need to reset it because the application\n\n104\n00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:10.460\ndoesn't give the user the opportunity\nto do a self-service password reset.\n\n105\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.420\nThose are kind of the typical historical\nthings we think of help desk with.\n\n106\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.790\nBut we don't typically associate\nthem with change management.\n\n107\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.310\nHowever, those ticketing systems have\nthe same kind of capabilities of tracking.\n\n108\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.000\nThey provide an audit trail.\n\n109\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.330\nYou can create standardized forms for\npeople to fill out.\n\n110\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.470\nAnd then it's just simply a matter\nof routing at that point.\n\n111\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.390\nWhen the helpdesk ticket comes in it goes\nto the change management board rather than\n\n112\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.050\nto a service desk person.\n\n113\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.830\nThat also gives you the ability\nthen to collect metrics\n\n114\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.520\non things like how many service\nrequests your getting a month.\n\n115\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.568\nHow many of those are change management\nrequests versus desktop support tickets?\n\n116\n00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:58.210\nVersus system administration,\ncould be depending on what\n\n117\n00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.260\nyour organization calls them, operations,\nchange requests, things like that.\n\n118\n00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.857\nMe, I'm always one of the ones who submit\na request please give me admin access to\n\n119\n00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:10.050\nmy local machine, so\nI can do whatever I want to it on it.\n\n120\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.403\nAnd give me full access to the network\nwhen I come into the VPN so\n\n121\n00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:14.745\nI don't have to bother you\nwith things like that.\n\n122\n00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.485\nAnd of course they revoke that, right?\n\n123\n00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:19.605\n>> Well you figured it was worth a shot.\n\n124\n00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:21.295\n>> Yeah that's right, it's worth a shot.\n\n125\n00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:26.209\nSee if they'll, see if I can social\nengineer my way through the Cloud.\n\n126\n00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:31.032\nAnyway, so it's really important\nto understand some of those\n\n127\n00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:34.640\nfunctions that the service desk provides.\n\n128\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.790\nFor instance, server support,\nservice delivery,\n\n129\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.590\nI'm sorry, and then also functional\nplanning and management.\n\n130\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.830\nBecause the service organization\ncan become a great resource for\n\n131\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.280\nknowing when you're\nreaching capacity limits.\n\n132\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.383\nFor instance, a company I do consulting\nwith just recently, for the first time\n\n133\n00:08:56.383 --> 00:09:01.638\never, I found out because I got an alert\nmessage from the exchange server that they\n\n134\n00:09:01.638 --> 00:09:06.841\nhave a policy in place, where you're\nonly allowed to store 100 meg of email.\n\n135\n00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.566\n100 meg!\n>> That's not much.\n\n136\n00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:12.600\n>> [LAUGH] That's not much at all for\na guy like me.\n\n137\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.400\nAnd it said, you must delete mail or\n\n138\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.840\nyou're gonna stop being able to send and\nreceive.\n\n139\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.370\nThat set off some alarms for me.\n\n140\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.180\nAnd here's where I wanna do\na little sidebar for a second,\n\n141\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.230\ntalk about root cause analysis.\n\n142\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.090\nThere had been another issue\ncome up within that company\n\n143\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.750\nrecently where there was some\nconcern of data loss prevention\n\n144\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.829\nbecause people were backing up their\nemail on portable, removable drives.\n\n145\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.920\nAnd when I said, well,\nwhy would anyone ever do that?\n\n146\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.845\nAnd they couldn't come up with an answer,\nwell, now I know why.\n\n147\n00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:52.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They had created a storage limit policy\n\n148\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:57.370\nin their exchange profiles\nthat created the DLP problem.\n\n149\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.600\nSo, my recommendation was\nlet them store more emails.\n\n150\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.930\nThey'll stop removing them\nin removable drives and\n\n151\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.830\nwalking off the, walking off the physical\ngrounds with back up PSD files.\n\n152\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.500\nWe haven't executed yet, that yet, but\n\n153\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.290\nthat was my, that was my recommendation\nwas you created your own problem.\n\n154\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.170\nThat would have never come up had\na service desk issue never been tracked,\n\n155\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.640\nit said why is this going on?\n\n156\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.310\n>> Yeah I've been to\nthis same exact thing.\n\n157\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.480\nI've worked in a corporate environment.\n\n158\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.403\nPeople, they get that email and you're\ngoing okay, our Exchange server is getting\n\n159\n00:10:30.403 --> 00:10:33.881\na little full, we need to take a look\nat that, where can we trim the fat, and\n\n160\n00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:37.030\nwe were just letting people keep\ntheir entirety of their mailbox for\n\n161\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.047\nas long as they've been with the company.\n\n162\n00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:43.330\nSome people have 50, 60, 90 gigs of email.\n\n163\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.740\nSo we say, well, we gotta trim that back,\n\n164\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.820\nof course,\nthere's a back push against that.\n\n165\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.340\nWell, I can't lose those advertised spams.\n\n166\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.220\nListen, the deleted items box, that is\nnot a folder for you to store things,\n\n167\n00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.860\nthat's for you to delete things and\nthey didn't realize that.\n\n168\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.470\nSo that was helpful.\n\n169\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.860\nBut you got to find that happy medium, and\n\n170\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.230\nusing these things is like you said,\nlike a metric is gonna help out with that.\n\n171\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.950\n>> Exactly.\n\n172\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.260\nOkay, so\nwe were talking about how the mailbox\n\n173\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.600\nissue through root cause analysis\nreally led us to find another problem,\n\n174\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.960\nwhich was DLP, Data Loss Prevention.\n\n175\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.930\nWe had PSD files going out the door on\nunauthorized back up drives because\n\n176\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.740\nusers weren't given enough space to\nadequately store what they could have.\n\n177\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.810\nAnd, in addition to that,\nno one had ever explored the idea.\n\n178\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.850\nYou were talking about how\nemployees had stored 50 and\n\n179\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.376\n60 gigs worth of email archives.\n\n180\n00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:40.360\nArchives compress e-mails dramatically.\n\n181\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.400\nExchange or admins know how to do that.\n\n182\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.700\nYou can set up automatic timing so\nthat every 30 to 60 to 90 days,\n\n183\n00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.280\nyour e-mails get archived.\n\n184\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.080\nAnd you still have access to it because\nit creates pointers in your mailbox to\n\n185\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.070\nthose files and\nthey're simply not stored until you.\n\n186\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.280\nThey're actually not stored\non your local machine.\n\n187\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.540\nThey're stored somewhere\noff-site on lower,\n\n188\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:07.760\ncheaper grade storage rather than\nsuper expensive flash drives, etc.\n\n189\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.600\nAnd make them available\nto you forever basically\n\n190\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.030\ndepending on what your data retention\npolicy is of the organization, etc.\n\n191\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.620\nBut at any rate, the point I was trying to\nmake was how the metrics and the reporting\n\n192\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.630\nfrom your service organization can\nbe extremely helpful in not only\n\n193\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.610\nfinding problems but helping you go to the\nroot cause analysis of those problems and\n\n194\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.590\ncome up with solutions like we did\nat the company I was talking about\n\n195\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.420\nwhere now we have both,\nwe've satisfied both needs.\n\n196\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.160\nStorage is minimized through doing\narchiving, which compresses the data so\n\n197\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.780\nit doesn't take up as much space.\n\n198\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.447\nWe've offloaded it to cheaper,\nslower spinning drive\n\n199\n00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:54.925\nstorage versus more expensive SAN or\nflash storage.\n\n200\n00:12:54.925 --> 00:13:00.580\nAs you may know, there is tiered\narchitecture in storage today from really,\n\n201\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.713\nreally, cheap big monster,\nmassive multi terabyte spinning drives\n\n202\n00:13:05.713 --> 00:13:10.759\nthat cost pennies compared to what\nit used to, to SAN storage which is\n\n203\n00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:15.718\nvery fairly fast and robust,\netc to super monster flash drives that\n\n204\n00:13:15.718 --> 00:13:20.970\nwe use in our virtual machines,\netc for that instant access stuff.\n\n205\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.130\nSo anyway, the point being, that\nthe service organization can be extremely\n\n206\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:31.050\nvaluable to you in an organization in\nterms of tracking down problems and\n\n207\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.590\nfinding out where they surface.\n\n208\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:39.090\nSo as an auditor when we go in we try to\nlook at those metrics to see whether or\n\n209\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:44.160\nnot the applications that we\ntalked about in the last domain,\n\n210\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.000\nin the last episodes about the systems and\n\n211\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.940\nsoftware etc that we've acquired,\nthat we've helped the company acquired.\n\n212\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.110\nAre they actually delivering\nthe service that they claim to be or\n\n213\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.660\nare we having other kinds of\nproblems creep into the picture?\n\n214\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.810\nThe audience for\n\n215\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.760\nsome of this, interestingly enough,\nis senior management.\n\n216\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.930\nIT directors, managers and CIO's.\n\n217\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.340\nThey're the ones that really\nlike seeing this information.\n\n218\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.490\nYour average help desk manager,\nthat's not really their responsibility or\n\n219\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.950\nI should say their service\norganization manager.\n\n220\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.980\nTheir responsibility is simply to feed\nthe information up the food chain, if you\n\n221\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:29.280\nwill, to the powers that be so that they\ncan begin doing their investigations, etc.\n\n222\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.280\nSo I might come around to a service\norganization manager and say can you show\n\n223\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.530\nme your reports on the number of viruses\nyou've been hit with in the last year?\n\n224\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.420\nI might say, you tell me that, or I heard\nfrom one of the employees that there\n\n225\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.210\nwas a ransomware infection recently that\ncost you guys hundreds of hours of time.\n\n226\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.850\nCan you show me the log trail\non the incident handling that\n\n227\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.830\noccurred as a result of those incidents?\n\n228\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.820\nBecause typically,\n\n229\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.900\nall that's recorded in the service\ndelivery organization's ticketing system.\n\n230\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.910\nSo it's a great audit trail.\n\n231\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.880\nThere's a wealth of knowledge in there.\n\n232\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.040\nIt can be a bit of\na challenge to do data mining\n\n233\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.600\nto find the information\nthat you're looking for.\n\n234\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.370\nBut typically if you're doing change\nmanagement and you're tracking\n\n235\n00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.640\nincidents of any type and doing all\nthat inside the service organization.\n\n236\n00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.630\nIt's a wealth of knowledge.\n\n237\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.557\nIt's important for\nus as auditor to understand whether or\n\n238\n00:15:30.557 --> 00:15:33.460\nnot there is a service organization.\n\n239\n00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.440\nIs it operating effectively?\n\n240\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.790\nIs it being funded properly?\n\n241\n00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.170\nOr is it simply, as I see, unfortunately,\n\n242\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.580\nin banks and health care organizations,\njust a password\n\n243\n00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.520\nreset function that's being staffed\nby people rather than an application.\n\n244\n00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.250\nAnd sadly, that's what I see a number\nof times when I go into organizations.\n\n245\n00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.050\nThey just don't see the value in putting,\n\n246\n00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.390\ncuz it comes down to that common\ndenominator of help desk.\n\n247\n00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.070\nThey don't see it as\na service organization.\n\n248\n00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.690\nNow, I have worked with a couple\nof hospital organizations and\n\n249\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.370\nlarger banks where they do see\nit as a service organization and\n\n250\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.920\nit's extremely functional\nin those instances.\n\n251\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.840\nIt does a phenomenal job.\n\n252\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.190\nIt helps them track problems and\nspot problems before they become really,\n\n253\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.620\nreally serious.\n\n254\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.420\nSo, that's it for our first\nsession on domain four information\n\n255\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.220\nsystems operations maintenance and\nservice management.\n\n256\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:39.060\nIs a little bit on ITIL and service\norganizations and the importance of them.\n\n257\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.820\nAnd the CISA audit candidate, excuse me,\n\n258\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:48.040\nthe CISA candidate needs to have\na thorough understanding of that.\n\n259\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.340\n>> That's right, it's gonna help us out.\n\n260\n00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.724\nAnd like you said, sometimes doing these\nthings can help us either discover issues.\n\n261\n00:16:53.724 --> 00:16:56.410\nSometimes they might as well\neven create an issue but\n\n262\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.850\nwe like the audit trails because\nthe on trail gonna tell us where,\n\n263\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.870\nit's gonna help us divine\nif you will where problems\n\n264\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.874\nmight be arising even if they haven't\nalready we have a way track things,\n\n265\n00:17:08.874 --> 00:17:12.460\nsee trends you said even if we have\nto get into things like data mining.\n\n266\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.310\nIt can be a bear but it ca also be\nvery beneficial for us as well.\n\n267\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.270\nUsing this as a metric like I said\nbefore is gonna help in that endeavor.\n\n268\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.030\nWell Brian, we thank you for\n\n269\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.160\ngetting us a got our little\nfeet wet here in domain four.\n\n270\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.760\nWe appreciate you explaining\nthese concepts to us so\n\n271\n00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.040\nthat we get familiar with them.\n\n272\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.140\nBe more prepared for the exam itself.\n\n273\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.790\nThat being said,\n\n274\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:37.470\ndon't forget to get yourself\na copy of the CISA fourth edition.\n\n275\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.860\nOne of our good authors,\nright here, of this very book.\n\n276\n00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.640\nHe's giving you the inside track so\n\n277\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.400\ngrab a copy of that wherever\nbetter books are sold.\n\n278\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.250\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n279\n00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.946\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n280\n00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.269\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n281\n00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.407\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n282\n00:17:51.407 -->

--> 00:00:18.370\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.304\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\non with our series on the CISA,\n\n5\n00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:25.135\nthat's the Certified\nInformation Systems Auditor.\n\n6\n00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:28.469\nYou'll notice I'm holding this lovely\nstudy guide, fourth edition that is.\n\n7\n00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.601\nJust hit the bookstore,\nmake sure you run up to Amazon.\n\n8\n00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.580\nGrab a copy as soon as possible,\ncuz we don't have one.\n\n9\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.631\nWell, it's gonna be a hard time to\nstudy for this thing, but guess what?\n\n10\n00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.203\nJoining us today in the studio,\n\n11\n00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:41.998\none of the authors of this great study\nguide is our good friend Brian O'Hara.\n\n12\n00:00:41.998 --> 00:00:42.814\nBrian, welcome to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:43.774\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:44.302\n>> Good morning, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:45.302\nIt's going well.\n\n16\n00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.215\nThank you.\n\n17\n00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:48.063\nThanks for having me again.\n\n18\n00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:53.494\nIn this second part of\nthe domain four series, today,\n\n19\n00:00:53.494 --> 00:01:00.354\nwe're planning on talking about\none of the task statements 4.2.\n\n20\n00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:05.201\nWe're gonna discuss conducting reviews of\ninformation systems to see if they still\n\n21\n00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.466\nmeet enterprise architecture needs.\n\n22\n00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:13.336\nIn doing that, part of what I want to talk\nabout today is kind of down in the weeds.\n\n23\n00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:17.175\nBut it's some stuff that even if\nyou're an experienced auditor,\n\n24\n00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:21.903\nif you don't have much IT background, this\nis gonna be really important stuff for\n\n25\n00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:22.949\nyou to remember.\n\n26\n00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.861\nSome of these questions\nwill be on the test.\n\n27\n00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:31.486\nThey'll probably be more like\nidentification questions.\n\n28\n00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.467\nMaybe a difference between RAID levels,\n\n29\n00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:35.739\nI'll talk a little bit\nabout things like that.\n\n30\n00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:37.634\nWink, wink, hint, hint.\n\n31\n00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:41.509\nSo pay close attention to this\nif you're familiar with IT\n\n32\n00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.513\ninfrastructure to any degree this may or\nmay not be of any interest to you,\n\n33\n00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:49.926\nbut we hope you stick around and\nlisten, anyway.\n\n34\n00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:54.161\nCuz there are gonna be some questions and\nsome answers, maybe for\n\n35\n00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:56.628\na free book giveaway later in the day.\n\n36\n00:01:56.628 --> 00:01:59.180\n>> And even if you are like you said,\nfamiliar with IT,\n\n37\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.603\nyou still need to know what about IT\nthey're gonna ask you on the exam.\n\n38\n00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:04.588\nSo it's probably a good idea,\nif you're studying I think for\n\n39\n00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:07.044\nthis maybe know that in advance,\nthat's what we are gonna do for you today.\n\n40\n00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:10.487\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna talk a little about\n\n41\n00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:15.086\nsystems designed in particular,\nmore hardware than software today.\n\n42\n00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:20.703\nWe already talked in one of our\nprevious episodes about software frame,\n\n43\n00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:24.305\ndesign frameworks models\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.645\nSo today, we're gonna talk a little\nbit more in depth about hardware.\n\n45\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.457\nThe other thing and we'll also talk\na little about maintenance of all that\n\n46\n00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:36.818\nin another episode after this one.\n\n47\n00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:41.791\nSo I wanna start by doing a little bit of\na review of some of the technology that\n\n48\n00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.909\nyou're going to be expected to\nknow not only for your exam, but\n\n49\n00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.496\nyou should know about in IT in general.\n\n50\n00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:51.224\nThe first one comes up with storage.\n\n51\n00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:57.350\nWe have basically, two or\nthree components of IT hardware system.\n\n52\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.406\nWe have CPUs.\n\n53\n00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:03.030\nWe have memory or RAM and\nthen we have storage.\n\n54\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.768\nWe won't get into the bus architecture or\nany of that kind of stuff.\n\n55\n00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:11.596\nStorage is the most important,\nbecause that's how data is retrieved and\n\n56\n00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:16.679\nwritten to for transactional\nreasons that we're in business.\n\n57\n00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:22.230\nSo I wanna start off and give you a brief\ndescription of what we call RAID.\n\n58\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.160\nRAID stands for, it actually been argued\nin the literature for a number of years.\n\n59\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.376\nIt used to be redundant array\nof inexpensive disks, but\n\n60\n00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.345\ndiscs did not use to be so inexpensive.\n\n61\n00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:40.254\nIt was called inexpensive, because it\nwas less expensive to take three or\n\n62\n00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:43.988\nfour disks and combine them together\nthan it was to buy a big giant one.\n\n63\n00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:46.229\nAnd when I'm saying combine them,\n\n64\n00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.497\nI'm talking back in the days when\nwe bought 10 gig or 5 gig disks.\n\n65\n00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.963\nIt was much cheaper to\nbuy four 5 gig disks,\n\n66\n00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:57.041\nfigure out how to get them to work\ntogether.than it was to buy a 20 gig.\n\n67\n00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:02.054\nBecause back in the day, 20 gig drives\ncould cost a thousand of dollars,\n\n68\n00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.050\na piece or more and they were very large.\n\n69\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.179\nI remember taking a one of the first\nID drives I ever soldered an early\n\n70\n00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.983\nIBM system.\n\n71\n00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:13.793\nThe drive was literally this big and\nonly held 10 meg.\n\n72\n00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:14.356\n>> It's like a cinder block.\n\n73\n00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:16.633\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it was gigantic.\n\n74\n00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:24.204\nSo the concept of RAID was designed\nto allow us to combine disks,\n\n75\n00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:31.357\nto either increase the amount\nof storage capability we had,\n\n76\n00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:37.947\nto increase the reliability\nof storage we have on hand or\n\n77\n00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:43.020\nthe speed at which we access that storage.\n\n78\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.777\nRAID 0, which is also called striping\nis the fastest of those three.\n\n79\n00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:54.737\nRAID 0 allows you to combine and there\nare graphs in the book you could look\n\n80\n00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:59.539\nup if you want to study more of this\nin details in terms of how it's done.\n\n81\n00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.457\nI's called striping without parity.\n\n82\n00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:05.415\nIt allows you to combine disks and\n\n83\n00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:11.444\nwhat it does is it writes one portion\nof each data file to each drive.\n\n84\n00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.915\nSo instead of doing one write operation,\n\n85\n00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:17.101\nit does three write operations\nacross three drives.\n\n86\n00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.936\nAt the same time, it only writes a third\nof the amount of data on each drive, so\n\n87\n00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.006\nit can write faster.\n\n88\n00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:24.269\nSo, it does that in\na stripe across the drive.\n\n89\n00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.482\nIt goes really monster fast,\n\n90\n00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:31.181\nyou used to see this a lot in\nearly days with graphic designers.\n\n91\n00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:36.283\nMac people would run RAID 0 arrays,\nbecause they had to move really large\n\n92\n00:05:36.283 --> 00:05:42.223\nfiles, sometimes video and graphic files\nthat were well into the gigabytes of size.\n\n93\n00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:46.585\nWe'd really stress a normal,\nsingle spinning drive, so\n\n94\n00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:52.742\nthat it would RAID 0 to increase the speed\nin which access and write to the drives.\n\n95\n00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:56.945\nThe next level of RAID,\nwhich is called RAID 1 or mirroring.\n\n96\n00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.871\nActually, allows you to take two drives\nand make a mirror that's why its\n\n97\n00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:07.360\ncalled mirroring you make an exact\ncopy of the data onto a second drive.\n\n98\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.650\nAnd when a file is either read from or\nwritten to the drive,\n\n99\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.920\nit pulls data, depending on whether\nit's a read or a write operation.\n\n100\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.924\nSo for instance, if it's a read operation,\nit will run twice as fast\n\n101\n00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:28.218\nas a single drive,\nbecause there's two copies of the data.\n\n102\n00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:31.431\nAnd if one drive happens to be\nbusy when you request the data,\n\n103\n00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.956\nit will go to the second drive and\npull the file.\n\n104\n00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:38.174\nSo, it can actually read data\ntwice as fast as a single drive.\n\n105\n00:06:38.174 --> 00:06:42.059\nBut when it writes,\nthe write operations are slower,\n\n106\n00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:47.218\nbecause it has to write two copies of\nthe data stream, one to each drive.\n\n107\n00:06:47.218 --> 00:06:50.813\nSo, what's great about mirroring is\nthat it gives you an exact copy.\n\n108\n00:06:50.813 --> 00:06:55.647\nSo if a single drive fails,\nyou still have a copy that's functional.\n\n109\n00:06:55.647 --> 00:07:00.386\nIf this top drive here were to completely\nfail become corrupted, stop working,\n\n110\n00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:02.974\nyou still have a complete\ncopy of your data.\n\n111\n00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:06.557\nIn the striping operation\nwhere we had three drives or\n\n112\n00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:08.712\ntypically two or three drives.\n\n113\n00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:13.508\nIf any one drive fails, because you\nonly got a part of each file loaded\n\n114\n00:07:13.508 --> 00:07:16.829\non each drive,\nthe entire drive strike fails.\n\n115\n00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:18.157\nSo, you've lost everything.\n\n116\n00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:24.532\nThat's the danger with striping and RAID 0\nis if any single drive fails, you're lost.\n\n117\n00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:25.555\nYou've lost all your data.\n\n118\n00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:26.143\nIt's gone.\n>> And\n\n119\n00:07:26.143 --> 00:07:30.109\none of the things that I've come across\nwhen we start talking about RAID is most\n\n120\n00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:31.611\npeople tend to think, well,\n\n121\n00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:34.575\nI'm not gonna use that RAID 0\nbecause if I lose One Drive.\n\n122\n00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.153\nI've lost all my data and\nit's not as cut, and\n\n123\n00:07:37.153 --> 00:07:39.483\ndry as that usually if I'm not mistaken.\n\n124\n00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:41.763\nIt's really the application.\n\n125\n00:07:41.763 --> 00:07:45.046\nIf you need high speed performance,\nRAID 0 is the way to go.\n\n126\n00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:49.012\nIf that data is super sensitive,\nthen your gonna try and go somewhere else.\n\n127\n00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:50.341\nYou need something with more redundancy.\n\n128\n00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:52.878\nSo, maybe a RAID 1 or other type.\n\n129\n00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:55.352\n>> Or\nmake regular back ups with a RAID 0, so\n\n130\n00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:58.110\nthat you can recover from\nit with a backup, but\n\n131\n00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.590\nthe drive stripe itself will fail and\nyou lose everything on the drive set.\n\n132\n00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.620\nNow, RAID-5 was designed to\nsort of create a happy medium\n\n133\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.270\nbetween the two of those with RAID-5,\nwhich requires three drives or more.\n\n134\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.480\nTypically it's four, sometimes five.\n\n135\n00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.600\nYou have three drives where\nyou're striping the data,\n\n136\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.420\nbut it also creates what's\ncalled a parity bit.\n\n137\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.224\nAnd what that means is that it creates\na calculation of what's written or\n\n138\n00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:34.082\nsort of a bit image of what's\nwritten on the other drives so\n\n139\n00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:39.122\nthat if any one single drive fails,\nthe drive will degrade in performance,\n\n140\n00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:42.694\nthe overall drive, but\nthe data will still be there.\n\n141\n00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:48.730\nAnd it won't return to full performance\nuntil that broken drive has been rebuilt.\n\n142\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.620\nThere's actually a rebuild\nutility built into those.\n\n143\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.100\nNow, the reason you would use a fourth or\nfifth drive sometimes is because you can\n\n144\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.050\nactually set one as a hot standby,\nas a warm standby, or a cold standby.\n\n145\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.610\nThose are important terms to understand,\n\n146\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.240\ncuz we're gonna talk about them in other\nareas as well where we'll use those terms.\n\n147\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.040\nThat means that, a hot standby means\n\n148\n00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.800\nthat that hot standby drive is also having\ndata written to it with parity, and\n\n149\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.130\nif any single drive fails, it immediately\nsteps in and takes its place.\n\n150\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.800\nThere's absolutely no\ninterruption in service.\n\n151\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.517\nThat's why it's called a hot standby.\n\n152\n00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:28.830\nA warm standby means that it's having data\nwritten to it, but only infrequently.\n\n153\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.580\nSo it may be at the end of the day,\nevery time the machine's rebooted,\n\n154\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.530\nit does a complete write,\ndumps all the memory stuff, caches, etc.\n\n155\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.292\nAnd then you can bring that drive online\nand rebuild your array much quicker\n\n156\n00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:44.310\nbecause only the missing data has\nto be rebuilt, not all of it.\n\n157\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.760\nThen a cold standby is\njust literally just that.\n\n158\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.930\nIt's just a dumb drive.\n\n159\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.530\nIt's probably not even spinning.\n\n160\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.530\nIt's just sitting in the array, and\nif your three drives in your RAID-5,\n\n161\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.400\none of those fails, you can then go in\nmanually and fire that drive up and\n\n162\n00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.958\nit'll begin rebuilding the array.\n\n163\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.210\nOnce the array's completely rebuilt,\n\n164\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.360\nyou've restored it back to full\nperformance, and you're back online again.\n\n165\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.420\nThese are all forms, and we'll talk some\nmore about these with the other devices as\n\n166\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.878\nI get into networking, etc.\n\n167\n00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:14.652\nThey're ways of building in\nwhat we call resiliency and\n\n168\n00:10:14.652 --> 00:10:17.554\nredundancy to your information systems.\n\n169\n00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:22.674\nBecause while we don't get into talking\na lot about the security triad in this\n\n170\n00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:27.953\nparticular course, the security triad\nbeing confidentiality, integrity,\n\n171\n00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:33.170\nand availability, without availability,\nyour company shuts down.\n\n172\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.790\nIf those drives fail and you can't get\nto the application, you can't get to\n\n173\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:42.190\nthe database, whatever it is you need\nthat's being stored on that system,\n\n174\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.960\nbusiness operations are interrupted and\nthat generally translates into cost.\n\n175\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.830\nOkay?\nSo you want to try and\n\n176\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.670\nkeep things up as much as possible.\n\n177\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.230\nSo again, this is where when you're going\nin and you're reviewing the information\n\n178\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:58.430\nsystems to see if they're meeting\nthe enterprise architectural needs,\n\n179\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.520\nyou need to understand,\ndo these systems need to be redundant,\n\n180\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.120\nor are they systems that we can live\nwithout for short periods of time.\n\n181\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.211\nThat all goes back to talking\nabout allocation of resources and\n\n182\n00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:13.170\nrisk management.\n\n183\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.330\nAre we putting all of\nour eggs in one basket?\n\n184\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.293\nDo we have the ability to build resiliency\nand redundancy in there, to protect\n\n185\n00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:25.650\nthe organization in terms of its critical\napplications and critical functioning?\n\n186\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.020\nSo just a little tidbit on RAID.\n\n187\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.020\nI want you to go in and\nread some more in the book on that.\n\n188\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.950\nI can't remember the exact\nchapter right now,\n\n189\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.850\neven though I helped write it, but-\n>> It is in there, though.\n\n190\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.550\n>> It is in the book,\nthat's right, fully with diagrams.\n\n191\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.505\nThe other thing to keep in\nmind is that with RAID-0,\n\n192\n00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:52.280\n1, or 5,\nthe cost is generally about the same,\n\n193\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.250\nbecause you're talking\nabout an array of disks.\n\n194\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.330\nIt's really just simply about what\nthe needs of the organization are.\n\n195\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.710\nHere's another example how you\nmight combine these to provide\n\n196\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.310\na better enterprise architecture for\nwhat you need.\n\n197\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:14.880\nThe server with the application running\non it may not do all that much.\n\n198\n00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.430\nIt's a web application front end, so\nyou bring up a web application on it, and\n\n199\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.700\nyou punch in some data, and\nit goes and gets something for you.\n\n200\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:28.070\nSo that may not require super\nmonster expensive RAID-5 arrays.\n\n201\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.890\nOr if it does, maybe you just\nkeep some cold drives around,\n\n202\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.490\nbecause it doesn't really\nget hammered all that hard.\n\n203\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.900\nMaybe it's the database which\nresides on another system\n\n204\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.070\nthat you wanna be able to ensure that\nthat database is always available.\n\n205\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.830\nBecause not only is the web front end\npumping data into it, but the accounting\n\n206\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.900\nteam may be pulling information off of\nit for billing and accounting purposes.\n\n207\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.690\nSo you wanna make sure that\nthat system is the one that\n\n208\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.120\nyou put the most amount of resources in.\n\n209\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.730\nSo again, this\n\n210\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.720\nis why you need to understand what\nenterprise architecture's about.\n\n211\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.820\nTo be able to go in and review and\nevaluate those to see whether or\n\n212\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:07.090\nnot the company's putting resources in the\nright place to effectively manage risk.\n\n213\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.140\nNext I want to talk a little\nbit about the types of storage.\n\n214\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:19.028\nAnd when I was talking about RAID-5 and\n0 and 1, I was mostly referring to\n\n215\n00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:24.094\nwhat most of us are familiar with,\nwhat we call spinning drives.\n\n216\n00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:27.428\nYou know, drives that rotate on a spindle,\nthey have four, five,\n\n217\n00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:29.340\nsometimes more platters.\n\n218\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.390\nThere are IDE drives, there are SATA\ndrives, there are SCSI drives,\n\n219\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.360\nyou don't have to know the details\nof all that technology for the exam.\n\n220\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.626\nBut it's important for you to know the\nterms and understand the differences, so\n\n221\n00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:43.459\nwhen you're talking with IT staff\nyou sound somewhat intelligent and\n\n222\n00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:45.249\nknow what they're talking about, right?\n\n223\n00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:48.480\n>> [LAUGH] Because they will point and\nlaugh.\n\n224\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.695\n>> That's right.\n>> They do do that.\n\n225\n00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:50.704\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n226\n00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:55.680\nin today's world we've\ntaken it even farther.\n\n227\n00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.813\nWe've gone way beyond those\nthree types of spinning drives.\n\n228\n00:13:59.813 --> 00:14:04.050\nAnd today we'll oftentimes\ntalk about flash storage.\n\n229\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.950\nIf any of you have a certain type of\ncomputers that are made by a company that\n\n230\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.470\nhas a logo that looks like a fruit,\nI can't say the name, I guess, but\n\n231\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.420\nalmost all of their machines\ntoday either use flash or,\n\n232\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.080\nif you look at their bigger desktops,\nthey use a combination.\n\n233\n00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.310\nThey call it a hybrid drive, where\nthe operating system and most of the most\n\n234\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:29.080\nrecent applications actually reside on\na flash drive, which is really fast.\n\n235\n00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.100\nFlash is super monster fast.\n\n236\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.890\nIt's also the most expensive.\n\n237\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.250\nBut then all the rest of the data\nresides on an older spinning drive.\n\n238\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.240\nAnd the reason for that is,\nit's less expensive,\n\n239\n00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.240\nand they can kind of combine the two.\n\n240\n00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.504\nBecause they know that, you know, maybe\nsome of those old photographs you took at\n\n241\n00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:46.862\nyour high school reunion five years ago,\nyou don't really want to look at anymore,\n\n242\n00:14:46.862 --> 00:14:48.409\nso you put them off on the old storage.\n\n243\n00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n244\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.380\nonly the most recent\nstuff you run on flash.\n\n245\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.988\nIn a business, for instance, flash storage\nis generally where you're gonna see\n\n246\n00:14:56.988 --> 00:15:01.960\nInternet-facing web servers,\ncuz you do not want users waiting, right.\n\n247\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.670\nSo you want, we got to deal with\nbandwidth, that's another issue,\n\n248\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.740\nwe'll talk about that later, but\n\n249\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.810\nwe want to make sure that those web\nservers are fast as humanly possible,\n\n250\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.650\nor technically possible I guess I should\nsay, so that people aren't waiting.\n\n251\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.890\nThen another type of storage\nthat has in the last ten years\n\n252\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.760\nreally taken off is called SAN or\nstorage area networking.\n\n253\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:28.820\nSAN storage typically tends\nto be very large, very fast.\n\n254\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.480\nIt runs, and you don't have\nto know the details of this,\n\n255\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.260\nit typically runs over what\nwe call fibre channel, but\n\n256\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.210\nit can also over run over Ethernet\nwith a protocol called iSCSI.\n\n257\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.980\nAnymore, iSCSI is becoming more and\n\n258\n00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.630\nmore popular because it's\na little less expensive.\n\n259\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.529\nBut, same story, just typically used for\nlarge, large volumes of storage,\n\n260\n00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:53.778\nof data that has to be constantly\navailable, it can't go offline.\n\n261\n00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:57.202\nAnd so what it does it just\ntakes a whole bunch of disks,\n\n262\n00:15:57.202 --> 00:15:59.368\nit doesn't care how many you got.\n\n263\n00:15:59.368 --> 00:16:03.436\nAnd you create volumes inside those,\n\n264\n00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:10.080\nof what are called logical pars,\nlogical partitions.\n\n265\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.740\nAnd when you need to add storage,\nyou just slap more drives into it, and\n\n266\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.480\nyou expand the l-pars,\nit's really that simple.\n\n267\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.020\nThe end user never sees any of that.\n\n268\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.910\nSo, you know, sometimes you may log\ninto an active directory domain,\n\n269\n00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.270\nfor instance, and you have a map drive.\n\n270\n00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.930\nAnd you look at it and it shows, you know,\nit's called your h-drive maybe for\n\n271\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.080\nyour home directory.\n\n272\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.420\nAnd it looks like there's 760 gig of it's\nused maybe and there's only 30 gig left.\n\n273\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.938\nWell, that's reporting for the entire SAN\nand infrastructure, not your home folder.\n\n274\n00:16:41.938 --> 00:16:48.340\n[LAUGH] And\nSANs can easily span multiple terabytes.\n\n275\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.170\nThe other reason they're used\nis they're extremely fast,\n\n276\n00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.430\nthey're every bit as fast as\nspinning drives in a local machine.\n\n277\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.940\nSo they're often time used for\nvirtualization storage as well.\n\n278\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.080\nYou create a virtualized,\n\n279\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.000\n2008 R2 server for instance,\nto do Active Directory domain work.\n\n280\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.530\nAnd, while there's a certain amount of\nflash storage, that the operating system's\n\n281\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:18.820\nusing to run on etc., any large file\nstorage, etc., would be offloaded to a SAN\n\n282\n00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.710\nto keep the virtual machine as small\nas possible in terms of its real size.\n\n283\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.590\nSo that's a little bit about SAN,\nand then there's another one that,\n\n284\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:32.410\ntypically you don't see in large networks,\nbut you will see it in smaller networks.\n\n285\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.450\nI've seen them,\n\n286\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.790\nthese used in banks in particular\nbecause they don't have the expertise.\n\n287\n00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.380\nBy the way, SANs are a very expensive.\n\n288\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.100\nThey have come down in price dramatically\nthe last ten years but they are not for\n\n289\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.960\nthe faint of heart.\n\n290\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.310\nThey can be very,\nvery expensive to operate and maintain.\n\n291\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.070\nSo typically you only see them in\nvery large Enterprise organizations.\n\n292\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.620\nThe next one we started talking about,\nare called NAS's.\n\n293\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.900\nAnd people get these\nconfused all the time.\n\n294\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.910\nThis is Network Attached Storage.\n\n295\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.090\nThis is basically, [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n296\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.070\nIt can be flash storage, or\nspinning drive, either one.\n\n297\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.280\nBut it's basically got\na network interface, and\n\n298\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.590\nyou just plug it into your ethernet jack.\n\n299\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.930\nAnd it shows up as a large hard drive.\n\n300\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.380\nAnd anyone can attach to it\nin your home network etc.\n\n301\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.290\nAgain, I do see this in some\nsmaller organizations but\n\n302\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.100\nbecause of the fact that it's so\nportable typically it's very dangerous\n\n303\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.000\nbecause in many ways\nbecause it's removable.\n\n304\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.350\nIt is really almost removable media.\n\n305\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.470\n>> So I can just walk up and\nbasically unplug it from the system and\n\n306\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.270\nwalk out the door with it.\n\n307\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.370\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n308\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.270\nEven if it's in a locked data closet,\n\n309\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.260\nif someone were to gain access to the\ncloset, it's typically not rack-mounted.\n\n310\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.310\nSo it's not screwed in, you can just\npick it up and unplug it and walk away.\n\n311\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.340\nBut it's easy and quick to do if you need\nstorage in a hurry for some purposes,\n\n312\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.310\nmaybe your tape backup machine\nis broken temporarily and\n\n313\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.070\nyou're waiting on parts or\nyou run out of tapes or your tapes aren't\n\n314\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.710\nworking anymore people use NAS\ndevices they are very quick and easy.\n\n315\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.332\nMostly these are the kind that you see\nin consumer retail stores like Best Buy\n\n316\n00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:10.403\nwhere you go in and you wanna buy,\nthey call it cloud storage at home.\n\n317\n00:19:10.403 --> 00:19:11.620\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> Basically it's just a NAS\n\n318\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.400\nthat you plug into your network\n\n319\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.690\nthat has a web interface on it that allows\nyou to configure the partitions on it.\n\n320\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.100\n>> You're building your own\nprivate on-prem cloud storage.\n\n321\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.270\n>> Right.\n>> Is what it is.\n\n322\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.030\n>> Right.\n>> It's kinda cool if you say it that way.\n\n323\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.595\n>> Exactly.\n\n324\n00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:24.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n325\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.470\nthen there are traditional spin\ndrives that you can buy at the store.\n\n326\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.430\nThey've come down to be incredibly cheap.\n\n327\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:40.010\nIn fact the other day I saw\na terabyte flash drives for $300.\n\n328\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.340\nWow.\n>> Yeah, and so, a two terabyte or\n\n329\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.464\nthree terabyte spinning drive\ntoday you can buy online for $50.\n\n330\n00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:49.210\nThat means [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, that's incredibly cheap.\n\n331\n00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And like you said,\n\n332\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.570\nwe come from the days when\ndisks costs a lot of money.\n\n333\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.130\n>> Lots of money.\n\n334\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.240\n>> And of course, they still do.\n\n335\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.250\nBut the ones that we're used to,\n\n336\n00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.990\nthose traditional spinning disks,\nthe cost has gone down so much.\n\n337\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.490\nAnd that's why we see this a lot where,\nand\n\n338\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.250\nI think you've alluded to\nthis if not outright said it.\n\n339\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.020\nWe tend to make long-term storage\nout of those type of devices.\n\n340\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.190\nBecause we don't need\na lot of IOPS out of them.\n\n341\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.970\nThey're just holding data for\nuse when we need it.\n\n342\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.340\nAnd we're not needing it all the time.\n\n343\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.020\nSo we stick-\n>> Well maybe it's-\n\n344\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.570\n>> In that deep freeze.\n\n345\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.550\n>> Maybe it's archiving.\n\n346\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.920\nMaybe you're archiving for\ndata retention policies, etc, exactly.\n\n347\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.010\nSo though spin drives are still out there,\nthey're very inexpensive.\n\n348\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.880\nFor things like backups,\nthey run much faster than tape drives.\n\n349\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.560\nMuch faster than tape drives.\n\n350\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.970\nAnd that's actually the last area I was\ngonna talk about was removable media.\n\n351\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.290\nAnd you know in the smallest form that's\nyour mini thumb drives those are SD\n\n352\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.730\ndisks, etc.\n\n353\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:50.199\nBut in often times, I see today\nespecially in even in mid-size banking\n\n354\n00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:55.235\ncommunities I see removable hard\ndrives which are spinning drives but\n\n355\n00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:59.689\nthey're using a USB interface\nmuch like a thumb flash drive\n\n356\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:05.740\nfor archiving backups\nbecause they're dirt-cheap.\n\n357\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:11.510\nThey hold tons of data and not only\ndo they do backups faster than tape,\n\n358\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.600\ntape, if any of you have ever\nmessed with them, are really slow.\n\n359\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.330\nYou can put gobs of data on them, but\n\n360\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.100\nthey're really slow and they're horribly\nslow when you try to restore them.\n\n361\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.420\nTapes actually read which is what you\nwould do when you would do a restore,\n\n362\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.240\nway slower than they write,\n\n363\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.450\nyou can write at about eight to ten\ntimes the speed you can read at.\n\n364\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:37.680\nSo if you have a 16\nterabyte tape Jukebox and\n\n365\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.110\nyou need two files off of it,\n[LAUGH] good luck with that.\n\n366\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.730\nIt's gonna take you a while.\n\n367\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.210\n>> First you have to find the right tape.\n\n368\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.070\n[LAUGH] Right?\n>> Exactly.\n\n369\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.230\n>> That's fun.\nI've dealt with the tape systems myself,\n\n370\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.550\nthe LTO 4 and the LTO 5 systems.\n\n371\n00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.720\n>> Yeah.\n>> Having to do a full backup\n\n372\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.780\non the weekends, run the incrementals,\npull the tapes off, take those offsite.\n\n373\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.280\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n374\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.210\n>> Because that's what were doing,\n\n375\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.810\nwe're trying to keep that data\naway from the disaster area.\n\n376\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.750\nIf my building blows up, and\nI come in it's a smouldering wick.\n\n377\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.870\nI can still go to my offsite,\ngrab those tapes, and restore everything.\n\n378\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.090\n>> Well, maybe.\n\n379\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.900\n>> Yeah, maybe.\n>> The other side of that is,\n\n380\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.590\nwhat if your tape backup system-\n>> Corruption.\n\n381\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.370\n>> Gets destroyed and\nyou don't have a tape drive for it,\n\n382\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.580\nyour tapes are worthless.\n\n383\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.500\nWhere USB drives, you can plug those\ninto almost anything and pull data back.\n\n384\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.030\n>> Gotta buy three of everything,\ndon't we?\n\n385\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:23.660\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n386\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.750\n>> That's not what it is.\n\n387\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.060\n>> Exactly, so we're starting to\nrun a little bit down on time here.\n\n388\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.490\nI thought we could get\nthrough more of this.\n\n389\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.860\nSo what I wanna talk about, I think maybe\nwe'll just run this into the next episode.\n\n390\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.390\n>> We can go a little over if you'd like,\nthat's fine.\n\n391\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.600\n>> Okay, so\nnext I wanna talk about network devices.\n\n392\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.190\nYeah, cuz these are every bit as important\nin terms of they are a part of your\n\n393\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.760\ninformation systems because they're what\nallow you to connect with everything.\n\n394\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.470\nI wanna make sure everybody\nunderstands the differences and\n\n395\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.000\nthe functions that they perform.\n\n396\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.760\nBecause you will get asked\nquestions about these on the exam.\n\n397\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.120\nThe first are routers.\n\n398\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.400\nThe routers are what we see\nat the edge of a network.\n\n399\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.190\nRouters, I don't wanna make light of it,\nbut they route traffic.\n\n400\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.010\nThey move traffic between what\nwe call local area networks.\n\n401\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.090\nThere's a great way to remember.\n\n402\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.870\nA CCI friend of mine\ntaught me this years ago.\n\n403\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:26.530\nAnything that happens at the local area\nnetwork level, happens on a switch.\n\n404\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.660\nThe purpose of a router is\nto move traffic from one\n\n405\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.910\nlocal area network to\nanother local area network.\n\n406\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.460\nOkay, that's the whole purpose.\n\n407\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.160\nYou don't have to know routing protocols,\n\n408\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.260\nyou don't have to know, all you have\nto do is, know is that's what it does.\n\n409\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.690\nThat it moves traffic from one local area\nnetwork to another local area network.\n\n410\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:50.348\nNow, those local area networks\nare managed in what we call switches.\n\n411\n00:23:50.348 --> 00:23:50.928\nOkay?\n\n412\n00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:53.155\nWe're gonna talk about the OSI layer and\n\n413\n00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:55.848\nhow all that plays into\nthis in another session.\n\n414\n00:23:55.848 --> 00:23:58.598\nAnd I want you to understand that\nthere are switches and routers,\n\n415\n00:23:58.598 --> 00:23:59.998\nthey are completely different.\n\n416\n00:23:59.998 --> 00:24:03.260\nSwitches handle traffic at\nthe local area network level.\n\n417\n00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.536\nSwitches have the ability\ntoday to also create and\n\n418\n00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:12.217\nhandle traffic in what we call\nvirtual local area networks, or VLANS.\n\n419\n00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:14.988\nThe same thing holds true with VLANS.\n\n420\n00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:19.500\nIf you wanna move traffic from one virtual\nlocal area network to another virtual\n\n421\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.914\nlocal area network or\nfrom a virtual layer.\n\n422\n00:24:23.914 --> 00:24:26.134\n>> A virtual [CROSSTALK].\n\n423\n00:24:26.134 --> 00:24:31.741\n>> [CROSSTALK] To a regular or physical\nLAN you still have to route the traffic,\n\n424\n00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:35.661\nit has to go through a router\nof some type somewhere.\n\n425\n00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:40.302\nNow, in today's sophisticated switches,\nwhich are very expensive,\n\n426\n00:24:40.302 --> 00:24:44.344\nthey're able to do that inside\nthe switch itself in software.\n\n427\n00:24:44.344 --> 00:24:49.953\nSome of the bigger, the older Cisco\nswitches, the 6900 series etc., had\n\n428\n00:24:49.953 --> 00:24:56.000\nthe ability to route traffic between VLANs\ninside the switch to make those go faster.\n\n429\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.800\nBecause generally anytime you go\nthrough a router outside of a switch,\n\n430\n00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.320\ntraffic will slow down.\n\n431\n00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.390\nCuz router interfaces\ninvolve a lot of logic and\n\n432\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:11.720\ntraffic has to slow down because you're\ntaking traffic from perhaps 500 local area\n\n433\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.970\nnetwork interfaces and pushing it\nthrough a single router interface.\n\n434\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.910\nIt's a lot of traffic, and\nso things tend to slow down.\n\n435\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.000\n>> Becomes a bottleneck.\n\n436\n00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.908\n>> Exactly.\n\n437\n00:25:20.908 --> 00:25:23.301\nIt also becomes a single point of failure.\n\n438\n00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:27.572\nThat's why I wanna talk about all this\ngear is I want you to understand that in\n\n439\n00:25:27.572 --> 00:25:30.911\nthe terms of the enterprise architecture,\nas an auditor,\n\n440\n00:25:30.911 --> 00:25:34.620\nyou need to know how to look for\nsingle points of failure.\n\n441\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.910\nSo, if you have 1000 switch\nnodes connecting to a router\n\n442\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:43.310\nto route traffic from there to\nthe Internet, or there to another office.\n\n443\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.940\nMaybe you have a New York office,\nand a Chicago office, and\n\n444\n00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.742\na San Francisco office,\nthere's routers between all those.\n\n445\n00:25:48.742 --> 00:25:51.170\nWhat happens if that router breaks?\n\n446\n00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.730\nYou've lost complete connectivity.\n\n447\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.980\nAnd so, you will hear in large enterprise\n\n448\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.520\nenvironments we typically\nbuy three of everything.\n\n449\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.408\nAnd I'll explain the third\ncomponent in just a minute.\n\n450\n00:26:03.408 --> 00:26:04.430\nBut you wanna have,\n\n451\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:10.190\ntypically, two of anything at what\nwe call a critical point of failure.\n\n452\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.790\nJust like you would have two web servers\nand do load balancing so that for\n\n453\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.270\na critical application in the event\nthat one of those web servers dies,\n\n454\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.950\nyou don't want your customers\nto not be able to get to you.\n\n455\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.110\nThe same thing's true\nwith Internet traffic.\n\n456\n00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.830\nIf you're doing live streaming like this,\nlike we're doing today here at ITProTV,\n\n457\n00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.690\nwe need to ensure that we have\nredundant hardware in place,\n\n458\n00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.280\nin the event that something fails,\nwe can continue our operations.\n\n459\n00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.060\nThat's what redundancy and\nresiliency really means.\n\n460\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.190\n>> And\nof course you're gonna get the CIOs and\n\n461\n00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.660\nthe people of the C level going how\nmuch is that going to cost me again?\n\n462\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.240\nBecause like you said,\nwe're buying three of everything.\n\n463\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.220\nThey don't realize that, again,\nif let's say, I'm Amazon, and just for\n\n464\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.690\nthe sake of argument, I've got one\nserver and I've got one router and\n\n465\n00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.810\none of those goes down, what happens?\n\n466\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.200\nI'm losing a lot of business.\n\n467\n00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.620\n>> That's right,\nyou're losing a lot of money.\n\n468\n00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.180\n>> Yes, I equate the two [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.670\n>> Exactly, and what Daniel is\nalluding to in terms of buying three,\n\n470\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:15.000\nis that typically what we'll do is\nwe'll put two routers together and\n\n471\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.640\nthere's protocols that allow for\nthis and I'll just mention these.\n\n472\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.259\nYou don't have to know the details, but\n\n473\n00:27:21.259 --> 00:27:25.507\nthey can run in what we typically\ncall hot or warm stand-by mode.\n\n474\n00:27:25.507 --> 00:27:28.797\nHot standby means, typically,\nthat they're both completely in sync,\n\n475\n00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:32.080\ntraffic is running through both of them,\nthey're load sharing.\n\n476\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.300\nIf one fails, the other one picks up\nthe traffic and keeps right on going.\n\n477\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.060\nThere's absolutely not even\na glitch of interruption.\n\n478\n00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.120\nA warm standby might not be\nmaintaining what we call state.\n\n479\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.590\nYou don't need to know\nwhat that is specifically.\n\n480\n00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.978\nBut what that means is it\ntakes a second or two for\n\n481\n00:27:48.978 --> 00:27:51.268\nit to pick up where\nthe other router left off.\n\n482\n00:27:51.268 --> 00:27:56.102\nSo it might drop, for instance, if you're\nat the Designer Shoe Warehouse buying\n\n483\n00:27:56.102 --> 00:27:59.826\nshoes or at the, what's the other\none my wife uses, I forget.\n\n484\n00:27:59.826 --> 00:28:03.096\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a shoe store that I get\n\n485\n00:28:03.096 --> 00:28:06.712\ndeliveries twelve times\na week at the house.\n\n486\n00:28:06.712 --> 00:28:08.754\nAll the men here will curse\nyou if you even mention that.\n\n487\n00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:10.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> I can't remember the name of it though.\n\n488\n00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.760\n>> It's that shoe store that\nyour wife will frequent a lot.\n\n489\n00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.802\n[LAUGH]\n>> You wanna make sure that you have\n\n490\n00:28:15.802 --> 00:28:17.710\nthe ability to back that up.\n\n491\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.230\nAnd what he was talking about in terms of\nthree is that if you have a second one\n\n492\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.180\nthat fails, and you've got one\nthat will pick up the traffic and\n\n493\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.180\ncontinue going, that's great, but\nnow you have a single point of failure.\n\n494\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.070\nYou need to immediately take that third\none and get it back up and running and\n\n495\n00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.760\nput in place so that you don't run\nthe chance of having a second one.\n\n496\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.320\nHere's a great example\nof where this happens,\n\n497\n00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.610\nworking in an environment,\nthis was two years ago.\n\n498\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:48.580\nAnd these guys had great battery backup,\nthey had a $100,000\n\n499\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.540\nbattery array for their servers and\nall their network gear, etc.\n\n500\n00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.709\nAnd they took a lightning strike between\nthe transformer and their building, which\n\n501\n00:28:58.709 --> 00:29:03.894\nmeans the transformer didn't have the\nability to stop it, the lightening charge.\n\n502\n00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:07.854\nSo, it hit the cable,\ncame in the building, fried,\n\n503\n00:29:07.854 --> 00:29:10.690\nfried their battery backup system.\n\n504\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.935\nJust completely toasted it.\n\n505\n00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:17.220\nAnd took all their routing gear offline.\n\n506\n00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.630\nSo, even when the power came back up,\ntheir routing gear was fried.\n\n507\n00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.160\nThey had no number three\nsitting on the shelf,\n\n508\n00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.500\nit fried both of their primary routers.\n\n509\n00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.789\nSo now, they're dead in the water.\n\n510\n00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:30.608\nWell now they keep a cold spare\non the shelf just in case that\n\n511\n00:29:30.608 --> 00:29:31.889\nwould ever happen again.\n\n512\n00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:34.754\n>> Where I worked,\nwe even went as far as to say, okay,\n\n513\n00:29:34.754 --> 00:29:39.184\nwe need three WAN connections to our home\noffice, which is in a different state,\n\n514\n00:29:39.184 --> 00:29:41.873\nbecause that gives\nthe redundancy that we want.\n\n515\n00:29:41.873 --> 00:29:44.708\nAnd we even went with different\nproviders for each one in case,\n\n516\n00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:48.410\nwhat if the provider that's giving me this\nWAN connection, what if they go down?\n\n517\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.951\nWhat if their fiber backbone is cut or\nsomething crazy like happens?\n\n518\n00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:54.241\nWell, let's go with multiple providers and\n\n519\n00:29:54.241 --> 00:29:57.310\nthat gives us multiple points\nof failure that we need.\n\n520\n00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.000\n>> Right.\n\n521\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.040\nAnd so, the idea is not to go out and\nbreak the bank.\n\n522\n00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.210\nYou have to look at\nthe enterprise architecture.\n\n523\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.240\nWhat are the objectives\nof the organization?\n\n524\n00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.580\nWe've talked about this\nin previous episodes.\n\n525\n00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.281\nWhat's the risk tolerance level,\nthat the organization has?\n\n526\n00:30:11.281 --> 00:30:12.546\nIs this a bank?\n\n527\n00:30:12.546 --> 00:30:17.542\nCan they withstand an outage, and\nif so, we'll talk about RTOs and\n\n528\n00:30:17.542 --> 00:30:19.040\nRPOs another time.\n\n529\n00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.640\nBut, when you start talking about buying\nthree of those, maybe buying three\n\n530\n00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.840\nrouters isn't that much, but\nwhen you start buying three firewalls.\n\n531\n00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.502\nAnd when you start buying three IDSs,\nor three IPSs, and\n\n532\n00:30:32.502 --> 00:30:37.725\nthree Sims all of a sudden this stuff\nstarts getting hugely expensive.\n\n533\n00:30:37.725 --> 00:30:42.620\nSo, for the firewalls, or the IDSs, IPSs,\n\n534\n00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.700\ntypically sit behind the router, maybe\nyou don't need redundant ones on those.\n\n535\n00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:51.180\nMaybe you could live with you know\na four hours of downtime on your,\n\n536\n00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.650\nmaybe not your firewall,\nbut maybe your IDS, IPS.\n\n537\n00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:58.440\nSo you have to start making those\nrisk analysis decisions in terms of\n\n538\n00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.330\nwhat you can live with in\nterms of not having two or\n\n539\n00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.790\nthree because you can, for\n\n540\n00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.820\ninstance, if your routers are still up,\nyou could lose a firewall.\n\n541\n00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.350\nYou could lose an IPS, IDS and\nstill maintain business.\n\n542\n00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.910\nThey're not absolutely critical,\nthey haven't stopped everything.\n\n543\n00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.699\nThe other thing is you wanna make sure\nthat those devices are configured so\n\n544\n00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:25.418\nthat, let's take your\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n545\n00:31:25.418 --> 00:31:28.245\nThat's what I'm talking about\nwhen I say IPS and IDS,\n\n546\n00:31:28.245 --> 00:31:32.870\nintrusion detection system and intrusion\nprotection system, a little bit different.\n\n547\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.460\nThose typically are designed to\ndo what we call failing open.\n\n548\n00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.384\nSo that if an interface were\nto die on one of those, or\n\n549\n00:31:42.384 --> 00:31:46.504\nthe machine were to burn out or a power\nsupply fail or something like that,\n\n550\n00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:48.708\nthat the traffic would not be stopped.\n\n551\n00:31:48.708 --> 00:31:50.728\nIt doesn't become a single\npoint of failure.\n\n552\n00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:55.428\nI remember working back in early 2005,\nWith an intrusion protection\n\n553\n00:31:55.428 --> 00:32:00.202\nsystem company where we actually had\nto put taps in around the interfaces so\n\n554\n00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:04.450\nthat if anything happened,\nthe traffic wouldn't stop.\n\n555\n00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.330\nBecause you don't want\nbusiness transactions to stop\n\n556\n00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.790\njust because your IDS failed.\n\n557\n00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.650\nThe last couple things I wanna talk about,\ncuz we are running over, here,\n\n558\n00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.999\nis I wanna mention SIMS.\n\n559\n00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.055\nYou'll see these spelled two\ndifferent ways: S-E-I-M and\n\n560\n00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:24.000\nS-I-M, Security Event\nInformation Management Systems.\n\n561\n00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.570\nThose typically tend to set off to the\nside of all of your throughput traffic,\n\n562\n00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:34.090\nand they simply watch for\nevents and track them, etc.\n\n563\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.870\nBut it's important that you\nunderstand what those are.\n\n564\n00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.060\nAnd then a couple of terms you\nneed to know for sure, for\n\n565\n00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:46.270\nthe exam on firewalls are what a DMZ or\na Demilitarized Zone is.\n\n566\n00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:52.630\nA DMZ is a specific zone in\nthe firewall that will allow traffic to\n\n567\n00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:57.940\ncome into a device, typically a web\nserver of some kind but then controls\n\n568\n00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:03.990\naccess from that device into the inside\nland, so that it only specific ports etc.\n\n569\n00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:09.330\nAnd when we dive into the OSI model,\nprobably in later episodes,\n\n570\n00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.890\nI'll talk specifically about ports and\nwhat that all means, so\n\n571\n00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.950\nIn reviewing your enterprise architecture,\nit's important to remember these points.\n\n572\n00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.490\nAre there single points of failure and\nif so\n\n573\n00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.450\ncan the organization afford\nthe downtime if the failure occurs and\n\n574\n00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:35.080\nif not at what point does it become cost\nprohibitive to do something about that.\n\n575\n00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.640\nSecond, are resources being\ndeployed in the correct places?\n\n576\n00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.420\nAre you buying firewalls\nthat you don't need?\n\n577\n00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.440\nAre they more expensive and have more\ncapabilities than your staff or evne,\n\n578\n00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.480\nI see this all the time companies will\nbuy the latest and greatest firewall, but\n\n579\n00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.830\nnobody knows how to use them.\n\n580\n00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.250\nThey don't have the time\nto get the training.\n\n581\n00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.250\nAnd they think that because\nit's the latest and\n\n582\n00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.310\ngreatest that it's going\nto do them more good.\n\n583\n00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.070\nAnd really what winds up happening\nis they're too complicated,\n\n584\n00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.090\nthey don't know how to configure them and\n\n585\n00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.910\neventually they get in trouble because\nthe boxes aren't configured properly.\n\n586\n00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.530\n>> Well they think it's just a magic box,\nright?\n\n587\n00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.280\nIt works, you plug it in and it goes.\n\n588\n00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.840\n>> And then does the enterprise\narchitecture itself.\n\n589\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.150\nSupport the organizational's objective.\n\n590\n00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:24.884\nSo there's all this money that we're\nspending and all these design we're doing.\n\n591\n00:34:24.884 --> 00:34:30.096\nAre they designed or excuse me are they\ndesigned to support the organization's\n\n592\n00:34:30.096 --> 00:34:35.480\nobjectives or the CIO's objective or the\ngeek guys on the front line objectives?\n\n593\n00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.280\nDid you buy the new firewalls\ncuz they just sounded cool and\n\n594\n00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.590\nthe sales guy got you\nto drink the kool-aid?\n\n595\n00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.890\nOr do they really support\nthe objectives of the organization.\n\n596\n00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.790\nBecause at the end of the day\nthat's really what it's all about.\n\n597\n00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.120\nAnd you'll find yourself\nin a much better position\n\n598\n00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.960\nif you're allocating resources\nbased on need rather than want.\n\n599\n00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.180\n>> Alright, well Brian,\nthat's a lot for us to chew on.\n\n600\n00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.900\nIf you're not familiar\nwith IT technologies,\n\n601\n00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.330\nthis has been a great primer for you.\n\n602\n00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.290\nIf you are,\nthen this has been a great review for you,\n\n603\n00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.600\nbecause these are the kind of\nthings that we have to understand.\n\n604\n00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.630\nWe have to be able to work with, like\nBryan says, speak intelligently about,\n\n605\n00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:15.240\nas an auditor, you need to be able\nto walk up to an IT specialist and\n\n606\n00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.010\ntalk about what it is that he does,\nand the equipment that he uses.\n\n607\n00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:23.310\nAnd how he's using them to create\na good risk management structure,\n\n608\n00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.690\nso if he's the router switch guy,\nare you building in that redundancy?\n\n609\n00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.440\nDo you have multiple points of failure\nwhen it comes to our internet connectivity\n\n610\n00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.180\nbecause if it goes down we're going\nto lose all sorts of business.\n\n611\n00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.140\nSo that's what it's all about,\n\n612\n00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.980\nthat's what we're trying to\nhelp you guys out with today.\n\n613\n00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.240\nHopefully you've got\na little bit out of this.\n\n614\n00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.050\nByron, we thank you so much for lending\nyour expertise on that topic again.\n\n615\n00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:43.800\n>> You're welcome.\n>>

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.070\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.390\nseries on CISA that's right,\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.660\nAnd right here I've got the study guide,\nfourth edition.\n\n6\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.200\nAnd guess what, one of the very authors\nof this lovely study guide is sitting\n\n7\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.830\nhere right next to me.\n\n8\n00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.650\nHe's been helping us guide\nour way through this\n\n9\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.730\nmyriad of information that we need\nto know so we can pass this exam.\n\n10\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.590\nIt's our good friend Mr. Brian O'Hare.\n\n11\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.550\nBrian, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.700\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.340\n>> Thanks Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.300\nThis morning and talk a little bit about,\na little bit more about evaluating\n\n15\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.760\nit operations to see if\nthey're still effective.\n\n16\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.500\nPart of your job is\nan IT Auditor is to be able to\n\n17\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.230\nwork around it systems and\nbe able to identify things that may or\n\n18\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.070\nmay not be brought to your attention,\npurposely.\n\n19\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520\n[LAUGH] So\nthat you can find out whether or\n\n20\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.520\nnot the organization is managing\ntheir risk effectively.\n\n21\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.220\nIn the previous episode we\ntalked a little bit about,\n\n22\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.540\nwell we talked a lot about routers and\nswitches and network devices, ect.\n\n23\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.590\nIn this episode, I'd like to talk\nmore specifically about applications,\n\n24\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.920\nand operating systems, and databases.\n\n25\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.840\nIn particular, what we're gonna\ntalk about is the application or\n\n26\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.650\noperating system lifecycle.\n\n27\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.200\nA little different than the SDLC we\ntalked about in previous episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.590\nso there's three specific terms that I'd\nlike you all to become familiar with,\n\n29\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.600\nsome of which will be on your exam,\nso you need to kind of know those,\n\n30\n00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430\nthey're in the book as well,\nthe first being end of sale.\n\n31\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.760\nAnytime a vendor, whether it be Microsoft\nor Apple or Oracle, something like that,\n\n32\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.590\nwho sells an operating system there\nis a date called end of sale.\n\n33\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.390\nIt's part of their\napplication system lifecycle.\n\n34\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.260\nThat's the date at which the vendor no\nlonger offers the product for sale.\n\n35\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.250\nAnd the reason that they do that is,\n\n36\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.660\nthat will feed into the next two terms\nwe're gonna talk about in a minute.\n\n37\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.778\nIn terms of how do they end\nthe life cycle of a product.\n\n38\n00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:31.280\nSo, in the previous episodes we've talked\nabout data management where there is\n\n39\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.080\na date where the data is created, it has\na lifetime, it has to be managed and\n\n40\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.960\nthen it has an end of life based on\nyour data retention policies etc.\n\n41\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.260\nAnd at some point needs to be taken\noff line and either archived for\n\n42\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.050\nlong term storage or\ndestroy them in some way or another.\n\n43\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.820\nApplications and operating systems\nare very much the same way.\n\n44\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.120\nThey have a defined life cycle\nwhere they are first offered for\n\n45\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.580\nsale, there are patches, upgrades, etc.\n\n46\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.531\nThen the first milestone in that\nlifestyle [LAUGH] lifestyle\n\n47\n00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:06.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.930\n>> Where the product's no longer available\n\n49\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.770\nto purchase.\n\n50\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.870\nFor instance,\nif you were to go online today.\n\n51\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.330\nI ran into this just recently.\n\n52\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.180\nIf you, cuz I was doing some\nsnooping around on the web to\n\n53\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.480\nsee what was out there.\n\n54\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.140\nIf you try to purchase a licensed\ncopy of Office 2010, for instance,\n\n55\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.250\nthere's a very good chance you're liable\nto get hold something that's loaded with\n\n56\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.790\nmalware because there's a number\nof malicious sites out there.\n\n57\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.080\nWe call these drive-by or fishing sites\nwhere Malicious users have loaded\n\n58\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.750\nwhat looked to be legitimate\nMicrosoft Office 2010 licenses that\n\n59\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.470\nturned out to be riddled with malware when\nyou buy them and download them not only do\n\n60\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.520\nyou not get Office 2010, you wind up\nwith a bunch of malware on your machine.\n\n61\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.580\nAnd you have to pay for it.\n\n62\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.070\n>> That is right.\n\n63\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.810\nIf you go to the Microsoft website, or you\njust Google Microsoft Windows Lifecycle,\n\n64\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.300\nyou will actually find a page that\nwill tell you the end of sale dates,\n\n65\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.890\nthe end of life dates, and the third\none which we call end of support dates.\n\n66\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.060\nBut most importantly,\nwe're gonna look for end of sale.\n\n67\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.440\nBecause that signals that\nif you needed a backup\n\n68\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.410\ncopy of that software for some reason, you\nwould no longer be able to purchase it.\n\n69\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.410\nSo if you ever shop that's\nrunning Office 2010, and\n\n70\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.210\nyou're now past the end of sale\nlife cycle in that product.\n\n71\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.600\nThat means if you have a new user or\nif you have a machine destroyed or\n\n72\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.930\nsomething, and you have any trouble\ncoming up with license keys to\n\n73\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.060\nreinstall that application, you may not\nbe able to purchase those any longer.\n\n74\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.890\nSo that's important, in terms of\n\n75\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.150\nmaking sure that your organization is\nprotected from those kinds of losses.\n\n76\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.670\nYou don't want to have to employ\nnew software that you haven't had\n\n77\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.090\nan opportunity to test, etc.\n\n78\n00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.620\nSo you need to know what those dates are.\n\n79\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.410\nThe second one we want to\ntalk about is end of life.\n\n80\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.470\nThis one starts to\nbecome really important,\n\n81\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.090\nbecause what end of life\ntypically means is that.\n\n82\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.040\nThe vendor will no longer\nprovide any type of security\n\n83\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.170\npatches short of, excuse me I\nshould not say security patches.\n\n84\n00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.340\nThey won't provide\nanymore service packs or\n\n85\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.290\nroutine patches other than\ncritical security updates.\n\n86\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.100\nThat has kind of become the security norm,\n\n87\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.270\nalthough you need to\ncheck with the vendor.\n\n88\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.830\nand the same is true of this for\noperating systems that run Cisco switches,\n\n89\n00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.380\nCisco routers,\nJuniper gear that kind of stuff.\n\n90\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.480\nThey all have these same things,\nend of sale, end of life, end of support.\n\n91\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.030\nEnd of life is important\nbecause it is signaling you,\n\n92\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.830\nalso that end of support is coming soon.\n\n93\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.970\nYou sh ould look at your\ndocuments to find this out.\n\n94\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.560\nWe've been working with a large\ncorporation the last two years\n\n95\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.120\ntrying to get them\n\n96\n00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.970\nto get rid of their no longer supported\noperating systems and applications.\n\n97\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.610\nThis is 2016 and\nthey're still running Server 2000.\n\n98\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.370\nWhich has been end-of-sale,\nend-of-life, and end-of-support.\n\n99\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.220\nWe'll talk about\nend-of-support in a minute.\n\n100\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.450\nAs well as Server 2003 which\nhas now been end-of-supported.\n\n101\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.175\nAnd they're also running no longer\nsupported versions of Office.\n\n102\n00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:32.325\nEnd-of-support, and\nI'm gonna come back to that,\n\n103\n00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:36.510\nend-of-support means that there\nwill no longer be any patches.\n\n104\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.830\nAny security fixes.\n\n105\n00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.970\nAny support whatsoever of the product.\n\n106\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.190\nSo, if you own it, and you have\na problem with it, you're on your own.\n\n107\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.770\nYou not only will not be able\nto purchase replacement media,\n\n108\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.120\nyou won't be able to buy license keys.\n\n109\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.760\nYou're completely stuck out in the weeds.\n\n110\n00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.830\nYou're not going to get any\nhelp from the vendor at all.\n\n111\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.500\nIn addition to that running\nend of support software\n\n112\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.820\nwhether it be on a router or\na switch or a server or\n\n113\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.640\nworkstation is extremely\ndangerous because hackers\n\n114\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.520\nknow that there are no longer\npatches being provided for those and\n\n115\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.990\nthey will continue to find\nvulnerabilities in the baking industry.\n\n116\n00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.630\nYou've heard me throughout these sessions\ntalk about my years of experience working\n\n117\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.855\nin baking.\n\n118\n00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:33.970\nMost of the ATM machines\nin the US ran a form\n\n119\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:40.640\nof embedded Windows XP for years and years\nit was very cheap to buy that version.\n\n120\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.390\nXP as we all know had been around for\nyears and years.\n\n121\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:51.090\nAnd it 2012 or 13 I believe it was,\nauditors from the FDIC\n\n122\n00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.710\nstarted making it pretty well known that\nwas one of the first things they were\n\n123\n00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.660\ngonna check when they showed up was to\nmake sure that you'd upgraded your ATMs.\n\n124\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.540\nBecause they did,\nthe last thing they wanted is,\n\n125\n00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.910\nto have a country full of\nATMs vulnerable to attack.\n\n126\n00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.880\nBecause, they couldn't\nbe patched any longer.\n\n127\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.150\nSo, that's one of the first things I\ndo when I go into a financial services\n\n128\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.110\norganization today.\n\n129\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.160\nIs I start sniffing out operating\nsystems to see whether or\n\n130\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.500\nnot there are any end of support\nsystems in place [INAUDIBLE].\n\n131\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.180\nIt's a huge,\n\n132\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.460\nhuge vulnerability, because there's\nalmost nothing you can do about it.\n\n133\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.800\nYou can't put some what we might call\ncompensating control of the place.\n\n134\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.020\nThere's a definition of that in the book\nif you want to check out what compensating\n\n135\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.400\ncontrol means.\n\n136\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.860\nBut it's a huge vulnerability\nto an organization.\n\n137\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.380\nLet's talk about applications for\na minute.\n\n138\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.150\nDatabase applications in particular.\n\n139\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.720\nI know that here at IT Pro TV you do\na lot of training on Sequel Server.\n\n140\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.570\nThere are many,\nmany versions of Sequel Server.\n\n141\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.210\nThey go back well over two decades.\n\n142\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.860\nI so remember when Microsoft bought SQL.\n\n143\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.260\nBack in the day and those databases\n\n144\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.830\nhave served their end users well but\nwhat happens\n\n145\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.640\nis application developers tend to write\nthings with out thinking forward.\n\n146\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.800\nAnd the end user comes along and\nsays, well,\n\n147\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.990\nI want this feature, or that feature, can\nwe upgrade this on the operating system?\n\n148\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.935\nNo, I'm sorry, if we do that it's\ngoing to break the database.\n\n149\n00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:26.080\nSo you get stuck with this database,\nand what happens as the years go by,\n\n150\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.420\nit's kind of like Windows XP,\nwe're Windows 7 had been out for\n\n151\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.320\nI believe close to six years\nwhen XP was finally retired.\n\n152\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.020\n>> It's been a while, yeah.\n\n153\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.140\n>> Maybe seven years.\n\n154\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.550\nAnd people were still running it,\nand I was like, wait a minute,\n\n155\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.490\nI haven't even touched an XP machine for\nclose to a decade.\n\n156\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.170\n>> Brian, the one thing I've\nlearned in my many years\n\n157\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.810\nof IT\n>> Is that when someone falls in love with\n\n158\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.190\na system, let no man break them apart.\n\n159\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.920\nI will tell you right now, I've sent\nsystems out, and people call me and\n\n160\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.390\nsay, I'm having trouble with my computer,\nit's giving me a, well you know what,\n\n161\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.140\nwe're well into Windows7 now,\nwe might as well go ahead and upgrade you.\n\n162\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.390\nSend them a new PC, it sits at their feet,\nfor I couldn't tell you how long.\n\n163\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.420\nThey'll continue to call and want you\nto troubleshoot their old machine and\n\n164\n00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.950\nI would finally have to use domain policy\nto say you can't log in to the anymore,\n\n165\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.360\nyou need to install the new computer.\n\n166\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.110\nThey will not, they got a depth\ntrip on them they love them.\n\n167\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.670\n>> It's hard to let go.\n\n168\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.950\nPeople don't like change specially\nwhen computers are not their forte and\n\n169\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.270\nthey get used to a system and even when\nyou move a button from the left to\n\n170\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.010\nthe right or turn it from blue to red,\netcetera, it can really shake people up.\n\n171\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.580\nThe important part of all this is,\nin my opinion, forward planning.\n\n172\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.810\nFuture planning is what I call it.\n\n173\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.530\nAnd I've seen this I can't tell you\nhow many times where it's okay,\n\n174\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:49.160\nI don't have any preference\nto programming languages.\n\n175\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.000\nThey come and go,\nthey come in favor and go out of favor.\n\n176\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.160\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n177\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.340\nBut you need to be, excuse me,\n\n178\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.000\nthe organization needs to be\nthinking towards the future,\n\n179\n00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.690\nbecause to not assume that what you build\ntoday will not work tomorrow is ludicrous.\n\n180\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.700\nIt's not going to work\non the new platforms.\n\n181\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.735\nAnd the platforms are going to change.\n\n182\n00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:12.850\nWindows10 is another good example.\n\n183\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.620\nCompany I had been working with two or\nthree years, we just eliminated,\n\n184\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.280\njust eliminated our last\nXP machine six months ago.\n\n185\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.750\nWe're already in the Windows10.\n\n186\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.360\nAnd we're already in\nthe Windows10 which is gonna be,\n\n187\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.930\nMicrosoft said they're not\ndoing version numbers anymore.\n\n188\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.190\nIt's a rolling upgrade.\n\n189\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.920\nBut basically there's gonna\nbe a major build-out.\n\n190\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.790\nThat's what you're gonna see now.\n\n191\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.460\nThey're gonna really send new\nmajor build in I believe June or\n\n192\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.540\nJuly of this year which will include,\n\n193\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.400\nwe talked yesterday on playback shell and\nsome other for feature enhancement.\n\n194\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.980\nBut the point being that they just got\nrid of XP everyone's on Windows 7 now and\n\n195\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.130\nI told him a year-and-a-half\nago you need to be testing and\n\n196\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.380\nlearning Windows10 now\nbefore it's released so\n\n197\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.260\nthat when it gets here you can be\nprepared to start rolling out.\n\n198\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.120\nWell, of course, just as Daniel said,\nnobody likes change, they drag their feet.\n\n199\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.530\nSo, now they've got a few people on ten,\nand a few people on seven,\n\n200\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.430\nand it just confuses everyone.\n\n201\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:18.540\nSo, the point is to be thinking forward\nabout that stuff, all the time.\n\n202\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.260\nConstantly evaluating\nthe applications you see used.\n\n203\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.710\nIn one of the previous episodes we\ntalked about how important it is\n\n204\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.695\nto keep an inventory of all\nthe applications and systems, etc.\n\n205\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.840\nIt's important to keep the version\nnumbers of those applications up to date.\n\n206\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.190\nWhether you're running XP Service Pack\nThree or Seven Service Pack One, and\n\n207\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.490\nI'm told, I read the other day now there\nwon't be a Service Pack Two for Windows 7.\n\n208\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.075\nMicrosoft is just kind of, probably\nprepping you for saying, it's over.\n\n209\n00:12:50.075 --> 00:12:50.850\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n210\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.540\n>> Go to 10 or die.\n\n211\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.240\nKinda the same thing with Office 365.\n\n212\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.000\nPeople who aren't embracing\nthat are really gonna get stung\n\n213\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.880\nbecause what's gonna happen is Microsoft\njust simply gonna end of life office and\n\n214\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.730\nyou won't have a choice but\nto go to Office365.\n\n215\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.090\nLike it or not it's simply gonna happen.\n\n216\n00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.320\n>> It's the wave of the future.\n\n217\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.700\n>> Yeah, and so why get in the way of it?\n\n218\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.960\nWhy not get ahead of the curve and\ntry to make sure that your organization\n\n219\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.060\nis prepped for that kinds of stuff\nby doing these kinds of things.\n\n220\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.970\n>> And plus, there's technologies\nthat haven't even been invented yet.\n\n221\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.290\nWe don't even know that\nthey're going to exist.\n\n222\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.650\nSo you have to plan for the fact that.\n\n223\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.330\n>> Right.\n>> If I'm doing something way maybe ten\n\n224\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.270\nyears from the whole industry will be have\n\n225\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.050\nbeen revolutionized by\nsome new technology.\n\n226\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.190\nHave I planned for\nthe ability to be able to rip that out and\n\n227\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.310\ngo with the newer type or\njump to that maybe go to a new building.\n\n228\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.870\nDeck it out with all of the latest and\ngreatest and then sell off or\n\n229\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.860\nget rid of all my old, these are the kind\nof things that we have to keep in mind,\n\n230\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.600\nand plan for.\n\n231\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.810\nCuz if we don't, then we're gonna\nbe in a world of hurt one day,\n\n232\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.640\nwhen the world come crashing down around\nus, and our systems no longer perform or\n\n233\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.890\nfunction efficiently, or effectively.\n\n234\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.710\n>> Right.\n\n235\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.620\nYeah, and another good example of that.\n\n236\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.540\nToday, is dealing with BYOD, or tablets.\n\n237\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.600\nThe mobile technology today,\nis changing so\n\n238\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.290\nrapidly that some of our older\nsystems can't keep up with that.\n\n239\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:14.570\nThe websites that we developed just\ntwo years ago can't produce a mobile\n\n240\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.900\nversion of their website.\n\n241\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.530\nSo when you go in to look at it\non your phone, it's horrible.\n\n242\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.300\nAnd that costs the company money.\n\n243\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.110\nSo the last piece I wanna wrap up with\ntoday is I wanna talk a little bit about\n\n244\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.220\nsomething else along the lines of\noperating systems and applications in etc.\n\n245\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.000\nAnd it's something that specially for\nAuditors and\n\n246\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.930\nI found this very useful\nwhen I learned it.\n\n247\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.520\nso I want to share it\nwith the rest of you.\n\n248\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.800\nThis is not on the test.\n\n249\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.480\nThis is just kind of a sidebar thing.\n\n250\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.630\nAnd that is, some vendors, not all, and\n\n251\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.740\nsome of them are beginning to\nchange their tune about this,\n\n252\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.570\ncuz people have abused it, but,\nin the past, we've called it golden code.\n\n253\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.440\nSo, Daniel may know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n254\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:06.340\nIn the Cisco world, there have been, for\nany particular switch, or router product.\n\n255\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:12.710\nThere is a golden code that is approved\nby the vendor that is absolutely stable.\n\n256\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.400\nIt may not have all the latest\nfeatures of the most recent code, but\n\n257\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.290\nit does not have any bugs\nin it that they know of.\n\n258\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.460\nThey may even tell you, for\nthe telecommunications industry,\n\n259\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.690\nuse this version.\n\n260\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.940\nFor manufacturing,\nuse this version because\n\n261\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.170\ntelecommunications may have special\nneeds with things like BGP and OSPF and\n\n262\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.460\nstuff like that where maybe\nmanufacturing doesn't.\n\n263\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.220\nCheckpoint firewalls, I don't know if I'm\nallowed to say that brand name stuff,\n\n264\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.000\nbut Checkpoint firewalls,\nJuniper, all of those different\n\n265\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.590\ncompanies typically have what they call,\nif it's not called The Golden Code.\n\n266\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.090\nThat's actually what the SE's or\nSystem Engineers refer to it as.\n\n267\n00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.310\nThey may call it the most\nlatest stable code.\n\n268\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.360\n>> Stable release.\n\n269\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.080\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.600\n>> Typically you don't want\nto run the latest version\n\n271\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.220\nof a vendor's code because\nit hasn't been tested yet\n\n272\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.390\ncompletely in the open environment,\nin the world, if you will, in the wild.\n\n273\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.530\nIn the application and\n\n274\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:20.070\noperating system world of desktops and\nservers that's not true.\n\n275\n00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.470\nTypically when Microsoft\nreleases a security update,\n\n276\n00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.680\nyou should be applying\nthat patch immediately.\n\n277\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.754\nThat's why its called a critical update.\n\n278\n00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:32.110\nThey've already done the testing for you.\n\n279\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.950\nRemember, they built\nthe operating system etc.\n\n280\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:39.360\nThey have a pretty good idea of how\nits going to impact other services.\n\n281\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.000\nI don't know why Vendors like Cisco and\nCheckpoint, etc.\n\n282\n00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.160\ncan't do the same thing.\n\n283\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.400\nBut I don't-\n>> They just don't.\n\n284\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.610\n>> Yeah, they just don't.\n\n285\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:54.440\nSo what's important to know, when you sit\ndown and you talk to the network engineers\n\n286\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.960\nin the IT department, is to ask them, what\ncurrent code versions are you running?\n\n287\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.370\nAnd then go and look.\n\n288\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.480\nOn the website to find out if they were\nrunning the version that the vendor\n\n289\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.150\nrecommends.\n\n290\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.550\nI find this often times when I\ndo audits because they don't\n\n291\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.350\nthink that I know anything about route\nswitching and what I find is that they\n\n292\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.640\nmaybe running code that's vulnerable\nto certain types of attacks.\n\n293\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:24.400\nHSH vulnerabilities or Or\nSSL vulnerabilities for instance.\n\n294\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.530\nAnd so, it's good due diligence for\nan auditor\n\n295\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.730\nto know where to look for\nthose kinds of things to be able to turn.\n\n296\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.330\nTo be able to adequately\ndetermine whether or\n\n297\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.170\nnot the policies and procedures and\nprocesses are effective.\n\n298\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.450\nThe last thing I wanna say\non this subject today is,\n\n299\n00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.640\nI forgot to mention in the last episode\nis, how all this wraps around change\n\n300\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.940\nmanagement because we started talking\nabout change management in domain three,\n\n301\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.570\nand it has to do with\nthe fact that any and\n\n302\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.910\nall of these changes whether\nit's patching, upgrading, etc.\n\n303\n00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.000\nAnd we're gonna talk more about patching\nand upgrading in another episode.\n\n304\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.480\nThey all tie very closely to change\nmanagement and vendor management.\n\n305\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.320\nRemember we talked in one of\nthe previous episodes about\n\n306\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.580\nhow important it is to choose\nyour vendors carefully.\n\n307\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.520\nYou know we, Daniel and I talked, joked a\nlittle bit, shouldn't have joked about it\n\n308\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.055\nyesterday about the bank in\nBangladesh that was hacked for\n\n309\n00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:31.144\n$18 million,\nbecause they bought $10 routers on eBay.\n\n310\n00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:36.810\nA bank, $10 routers on eBay.\n\n311\n00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.520\nAnd so, you can see how vitally\nimportant this stuff is.\n\n312\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.170\nSo I think that wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n313\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:44.880\nThanks, Daniel.\n\n314\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.540\nAnd we'll just go from there.\n\n315\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.150\n>> No, thank you so much for\nusing your expertise,\n\n316\n00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.000\nyour experience, to impart into us.\n\n317\n00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.650\nThat's what we're here for,\nto learn from you,\n\n318\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.880\nand you definitely have a wealth of\nknowledge when it comes to this stuff.\n\n319\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.390\nSo we are all very thankful, I'm sure.\n\n320\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.480\nThat being said, we got more episodes\nto come, but as for this one,\n\n321\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.030\nit looks like we're winding it down.\n\n322\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.720\nDo not forget to grab your study guide.\n\n323\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.410\nThe CISA study guide because Brian is\none of the authors of this good book.\n\n324\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.140\nYou want

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:21.231\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.290\nour series on CISA, that's\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.120\nAnd I've got the wonderful study\nguide we've been working with here.\n\n6\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.734\nThis is the new fourth edition.\n\n7\n00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:33.814\nAnd one of the auditors,\none of the auditors, he is an auditor.\n\n8\n00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:37.135\nOne of the authors, it's fun to get those\ntwo words mixed up cuz you're both,\n\n9\n00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:38.990\nyou're both an auditor and an author.\n\n10\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.209\nHe is one of the authors of this book, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.570\nBryan O'Hara joining us\nin the studio today.\n\n12\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.500\nBryan, welcome back and\nhow's it going, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.037\n>> Thank you Daniel, it's going well.\n\n14\n00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:49.600\nI appreciate you having\nme here once again.\n\n15\n00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.882\nIn today's episode, we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit more about information systems\n\n16\n00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.880\noperations and management.\n\n17\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.201\nThis is part four of this series.\n\n18\n00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:02.350\nAnd today, I'd like to talk\nspecifically about patching and\n\n19\n00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.036\nupgrade procedures and\neffectiveness of all of that.\n\n20\n00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:11.778\nIn the previous episode, I talked a lot\nabout how to identify end-of-sale or\n\n21\n00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:18.042\nend-of-life or end-of-support issues\nwith operating systems and applications\n\n22\n00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:23.445\nin the enterprise environment and\nsome ideas about how to deal with that.\n\n23\n00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:25.587\nToday, what I wanna talk about is for\n\n24\n00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:29.318\nhopefully those systems that\nare still in life, if you will, or\n\n25\n00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:34.120\nstill breathing, the vendors and\nsuch are still breathing life into them.\n\n26\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.800\nI wanna talk about the policies but,\nmore importantly,\n\n27\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.940\nthe procedures around how\nto adequately patch and\n\n28\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.110\nupgrade those systems to keep them\nin nice, clean, working order.\n\n29\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.240\nGenerally, when you don't patch or\nupgrade systems, you are susceptible to\n\n30\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110\nvulnerabilities that continue to be found\nin the systems, and that's why we do that.\n\n31\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.460\nNow I'll talk about sort of two or\nthree different realms.\n\n32\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.585\nWe'll talk about servers and\nserver-based applications.\n\n33\n00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:09.394\nWe'll talk about workstations and\nworkstation-based applications.\n\n34\n00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:14.380\nThen we'll talk about networking gear,\nrouters, switches, that kind of thing.\n\n35\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.000\nWe're still talking about patching and\nupgrading all those,\n\n36\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.930\nbut there are some nuances\nbetween the two and\n\n37\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.499\nthree different environments\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n38\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.940\nFirst of all is, going back to what\nI've repeated in numerous sessions,\n\n39\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.000\niSocket is a worldwide organization\nwith over 118,000 members worldwide.\n\n40\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.500\nThey tend to think and talk in very large\nterms, very large enterprise terms.\n\n41\n00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.570\nSo, when I say things like,\n\n42\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.860\nyou need to have a test environment for\ntesting hardware and software upgrades,\n\n43\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.360\na lot of companies don't have\nthat capability, they just don't.\n\n44\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440\nIt's very expensive, but\nwhen you're in a large enterprise,\n\n45\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.350\nit's very expensive to not test\nbecause if you are doing an upgrade or\n\n46\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.020\nan update or something along those\nlines and you break something critical,\n\n47\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.280\nit could cost your company a lot\nof money and a lot of downtime.\n\n48\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.331\nSo when you have the ability,\n\n49\n00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:16.214\nI can't stress this enough,\ntest, test, and\n\n50\n00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:21.720\nretest before you deploy patches,\nupgrades, etc.\n\n51\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.666\nYou can't typically begin\nto anticipate every single\n\n52\n00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:30.070\ninteraction that software\nmight have with other systems.\n\n53\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.300\nAnd so, you can't always\npredict how they might react.\n\n54\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.560\nIn the previous episode,\nI talked about on particular routers and\n\n55\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.470\nswitches about using what has been\nin the past called Golden Code or\n\n56\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.430\ncode that the vendor says is\nthe latest and greatest, most stable.\n\n57\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.740\nIt's very important that you know\nhow to find out what those are or\n\n58\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.550\nat least know where to go\nto ask those questions.\n\n59\n00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.830\nIf you go into a shop and\nyou find a routing environment where\n\n60\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.730\nthe staff are four, five,\n\n61\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.440\nmaybe six versions behind what\nthe vendor considers to be the latest,\n\n62\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.240\nmost stable version of\nthe code on the routers and\n\n63\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.850\nswitches, I'm gonna start asking\nquestions why they haven't upgraded.\n\n64\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.790\nAnd if they don't have a really good\nanswer, which is because they haven't got\n\n65\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.990\naround to it, then I'm gonna probably\ntake a harder look at their management\n\n66\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.010\nstructure to see why those things aren't\nbeing brought to management's attention.\n\n67\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.960\nWhy they're not staying up with it,\nwhat is their upgrade policy,\n\n68\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.060\nwhat is their maintenance policy,\netc., for taking care of those things.\n\n69\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.333\nAnd is it adequately\nprotecting the environment\n\n70\n00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:39.813\nbased on the strategic business\nobjectives of the organization.\n\n71\n00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:45.775\nI wanna talk a little bit about some\npractical hands-on procedures for\n\n72\n00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:47.570\ndoing that testing.\n\n73\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.651\nTypically, find yourself a spare room\nin the building somewhere where you've\n\n74\n00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.220\ngot adequate power,\nnetwork connectivity, etc.\n\n75\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.831\nAnd make sure you have,\nif you're doing a hardware upgrade,\n\n76\n00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:03.000\nthat you have identical hardware.\n\n77\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.470\nLet's say, for instance, that you're\ndoing a BIOS upgrade on a server.\n\n78\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.080\nThat actually rarely happens, but there\nare some instances where the firmware\n\n79\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.280\non a server is causing a problem, in\nparticular, when you're running something\n\n80\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.759\nas critical as, say, VMware on top of\nthat ESXI or something like that, or ESX.\n\n81\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.010\nThe manufacturer may recommend\na BIOS firmware upgrade.\n\n82\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.600\nThat's a huge deal on a server because\nif a firmware upgrade goes sour,\n\n83\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.330\nyou could lose the entire server.\n\n84\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.040\nYou may have to send it back to\nthe factory to be completely reset.\n\n85\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.280\nSo you wanna be extremely careful, and\n\n86\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.100\nthe BIOS is the very core,\nthe foundation of how that system runs.\n\n87\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.959\nAnd if something messes up with it, it can\nreally have severe repercussions across\n\n88\n00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.122\nall the applications\nrunning on that system.\n\n89\n00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:52.051\n>> And ironically,\nif you call for support, say,\n\n90\n00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.800\nsomething's happening with your server.\n\n91\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.970\nYou think, I need to call HP,\nI need to call Dell,\n\n92\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.770\nwhoever your server vendor may be.\n\n93\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.140\nAnd you say, I'm trying to have this\nlittle issue here, can you help me?\n\n94\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.779\nAnd they say, we'll have you\nupgraded to firmware version 8.9?\n\n95\n00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.820\nAnd you're like, well,\nno, we're still on 8.7.\n\n96\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.750\nCall us after you've upgraded to version\n8.9, otherwise, we don't support you.\n\n97\n00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.280\nAnd so it's like a catch-22.\n\n98\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.140\nNow do I upgrade my firmware and take\nthe chances of really hosing a system and\n\n99\n00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.855\nlose the support?\n\n100\n00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:20.605\nAnd it's a really hard thing to work with.\n\n101\n00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:25.807\n>> Right, it is, and again,\nthat's part of our jobs as auditors,\n\n102\n00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:30.633\nis to go in and find out how\neffectively the IT organization is\n\n103\n00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:33.868\nmanaging these kinds of difficulties.\n\n104\n00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:38.267\nSo, again, going back to having some\nkind of a test environment, for\n\n105\n00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:43.115\ninstance, if you got, I'll just make\nsomething up, a Dell 36x server and\n\n106\n00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:46.471\nyou're being told you need\nto upgrade the firmware,\n\n107\n00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:51.321\nthen you should have another 36x server\nidentical to it in configuration to\n\n108\n00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:56.430\ntest the firmware upgrade on first to make\nsure that it's not gonna blow things.\n\n109\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.724\nAnd, in particular, not just the firmware,\nbut all the applications and\n\n110\n00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:02.613\nthe server software that runs\non that particular machine, etc.\n\n111\n00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:06.232\nBecause, again, the firmware's\nthe very foundation of the system and\n\n112\n00:07:06.232 --> 00:07:09.310\nit can affect everything going\nclear up the stack later on.\n\n113\n00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.500\nSo you wanna make sure that you do\nthorough testing on those kinds of things.\n\n114\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.420\nCheck it out with vendors, and then\nalso be able to do back out procedures.\n\n115\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.649\nWhat happens if the upgrade goes okay, but\n\n116\n00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:26.782\nit does cause more problems\nwith your software, etc?\n\n117\n00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:33.318\nYou wanna be able to rev that firmware\nback down so that you still have a machine\n\n118\n00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:38.662\nthat's in equivalent shape of\nthe one that's in production.\n\n119\n00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:42.682\nSo my next point is just that,\nis you need a test environment because you\n\n120\n00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:46.841\nshould never, ever, ever test things\nout in a production environment.\n\n121\n00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:52.007\nThat is a recipe for\nguaranteed job loss and disaster, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:52.007 --> 00:07:55.246\nWhen things can go wrong,\nthey will absolutely.\n\n123\n00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:58.051\nYou don't do updates on a Friday\nafternoon, do you, Daniel?\n\n124\n00:07:58.051 --> 00:07:58.965\n>> No, you do not.\n\n125\n00:07:58.965 --> 00:07:59.771\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.995\n>> Unless you like to work weekends.\n\n127\n00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:02.085\n[LAUGH]\n>> Even then,\n\n128\n00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:03.798\nyou want to make sure you get\nhold of support if you need them.\n\n129\n00:08:03.798 --> 00:08:04.600\n>> That's right.\n\n130\n00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.870\n>> They might not be\navailable on weekends.\n\n131\n00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.990\nYou need to make sure, for instance,\nthat you have support contracts in place.\n\n132\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.140\nThat's another problem is you go to do\na firmware upgrade on a very important key\n\n133\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.040\nserver, then you find out there's\na problem and you pick up the phone and\n\n134\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.520\nyou realize, uh-oh, purchasing forgot\nto cut that check to the company for\n\n135\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.161\nyour support, or your Cisco Smartnet\ncontract is gone out of contract and\n\n136\n00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:36.330\nyou now no longer have support,\nyou can't get updated software, etc, etc.\n\n137\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.610\nSo, all of these things go into\nmanaging the IT environment, and\n\n138\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.030\nwhen you go in as an auditor, you have to\nbe looking at all aspects of this stuff.\n\n139\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:52.180\nAnd it all starts to come up when you're\nlooking at how they handle upgrades,\n\n140\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.430\nhow they do maintenance,\nhow they keep these systems running and\n\n141\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.740\nin tip top shape so that they perform\nto the best of their ability,\n\n142\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:06.300\nbased on the money that you've spend and\nthe resources you've allocated to that.\n\n143\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.100\nSo the next thing, let's just assume\nyou've got somewhat of a test\n\n144\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.840\nenvironment even if it's just a room\nwith a couple of servers in it,\n\n145\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.120\nyou wanna check with your application\nvendors before you do upgrades as well.\n\n146\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.110\nLet's move from the server hardware arena\n\n147\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.250\nto the operating system stuff now,\nand let's talk about Microsoft.\n\n148\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.730\nBecause Microsoft, while it's not\nthe only operating system in the world,\n\n149\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.980\nwe know that the vast majority of\nwhat you deal with is going to be\n\n150\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.610\nthe Microsoft environment.\n\n151\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.117\nTypically, what you're going to run\ninto is Lynx, Unix and/or mainframes, or\n\n152\n00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:46.470\nAS/400s, and Windows, the vast majority\nis gonna be Windows stuff, though.\n\n153\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.350\nYou wanna check with Microsoft.\n\n154\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.930\nFind out what kind of\ninteraction those upgrades and\n\n155\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.980\npatches might have on other systems.\n\n156\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.310\nIt's very typical for\nan enterprise environment to have\n\n157\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.510\nnot only active directory servers,\nbut exchange servers and SQL servers.\n\n158\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.080\nThey all could be running on different\nplatforms with different patch levels.\n\n159\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.710\nBased on the needs, certain patches might\nbreak things in SQL that doesn't break\n\n160\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.840\nin Exchange, etc, you need to work\nvery closely with your vendors, again,\n\n161\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.940\nmaking sure that you have\nsupport contracts in place so\n\n162\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.810\nthat when you do get in a pinch,\nas an auditor,\n\n163\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.250\nyou're not going to be doing the patching\nand you you wont have to deal with this,\n\n164\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.400\nbut you wanna make sure that the\norganization has all that stuff in place,\n\n165\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.210\nand that the processes for\nmaintaining that are operating smoothly.\n\n166\n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.550\nI remember working in a health care\norganization a couple years ago and\n\n167\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.840\nI had just come on site\nto begin my audit work.\n\n168\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.960\nI was gathering documentation and\ngetting names of people, etc.,\n\n169\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.230\nand all of a sudden,\n\n170\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.010\nthe entire hospital, almost 16,000\nemployees lost Internet connectivity.\n\n171\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.450\nBoonk, just offline, the whole network.\n\n172\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.380\nThat's kind of a major outage.\n\n173\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:04.600\nCome to find out later that what happened\nwas the purchasing department had failed\n\n174\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.050\nto cut a check to the firewall vendor,\nwho had a web filtering blade installed\n\n175\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.525\nin the checkpoint firewall, and when that\nlicense expired, all web traffic stopped.\n\n176\n00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:17.710\n>> [LAUGH] That will do it.\n\n177\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.940\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n178\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.570\nThe CEO was not a happy camper that day.\n\n179\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.280\n>> No, heads rolled, I'm sure.\n\n180\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.840\n>> Yeah, and so\nthe fingers start pointing, etc.\n\n181\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.550\nBut, that was one of my audit findings,\n\n182\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.800\nwas that purchasing was not\nstaying on top of it, and\n\n183\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.770\nit was partly the IT department's problem,\nbecause they'd submitted the request late.\n\n184\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.680\nImagine that, because they were\nunderstaffed, they were dealing with lots\n\n185\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.320\nof other issues, and so, you get into the\nblame game or you do root cause analysis.\n\n186\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.070\nYou've heard me talk about that before,\nand go back to guess what?\n\n187\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.750\nI mentioned in the last episode,\nchange management.\n\n188\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.200\nThis all goes back to change management,\n\n189\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.720\nwhere change management\nwasn't handled effectively.\n\n190\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.410\nThose documents should have\nbeen turned in ahead of time.\n\n191\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.700\nA manager should have probably\nbeen in the middle of all that.\n\n192\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.680\nAnd it all boiled down to the root\ncause really was IT didn't\n\n193\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.380\nhave the resources to do what they\nneeded to do, they need more staffing.\n\n194\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.980\nNow, the upper levels\ndon't wanna hear that,\n\n195\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.330\nthey wanna hear that somebody, somebody-\n>> Messed up.\n\n196\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.480\n>> Forgot to do something, yeah.\n\n197\n00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.130\nAnd the reality was they're just too busy,\nand they didn't get it done.\n\n198\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.750\nAnd the reason they're too busy,\nthey don't have enough staff.\n\n199\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.630\nSo, recalls analysis is a great tool to\nget familiar with in terms of looking\n\n200\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.990\nbeyond what seems to be the additional\nanswer to the problem which was,\n\n201\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.610\nwell, Billy Bob forgot to\nsubmit that in a timely manner.\n\n202\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.070\nWell, that's because Billy Bob was really,\nreally,\n\n203\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.350\nreally busy, doing things that\nhis boss was telling him to do.\n\n204\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.610\nHe can only be so many places at a time.\n\n205\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.530\n>> Is discovering these types of root\ncauses, is that really one of the end\n\n206\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:56.440\ngames of being an auditor, is trying\nto discover places where you're really\n\n207\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.740\nset up for failure in this point and\nyeah it happened on this one but,\n\n208\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.100\nas we go in and audit, we're looking for\nthose things so that they don't happen?\n\n209\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.420\n>> I think that's a sign\nof a good auditor.\n\n210\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.400\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.820\n>> There's a differentiator\n\n212\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.450\nthere, I really do.\n\n213\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.920\nAn auditor might go in and say, well,\n\n214\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.540\nthe finding was that the IT department\ndidn't submit their paperwork on time.\n\n215\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.240\nThat is true.\nThere is nothing wrong with that,\n\n216\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.330\nthat is a finding.\n\n217\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.360\nBut is it a root cause of the problem?\n\n218\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.970\nProbably not.\n\n219\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:29.290\nYou mentioned earlier that you used to\ndo WSUS management in the network and\n\n220\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:34.820\nI haven't asked you this question yet,\nbut are you aware that WSUS has a flaw?\n\n221\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.995\n>> I know it has a lot of flaws,\ncuz it was a horrible system.\n\n222\n00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:38.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it has a lot flaws.\n\n223\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.720\nSo here's a great war story about that.\n\n224\n00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.420\nI learned this a long time\nat about going in and\n\n225\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.530\nI would watch other auditors say this.\n\n226\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.250\nThey say, well, show me your WSUS log so\nthat you can prove that\n\n227\n00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.230\nyou've applied all the pertinent patches\nto your systems, per your policy.\n\n228\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.770\nOk cool, and they'll show you in\nthe logs and screen shots and all that.\n\n229\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.170\nThen I would go and run the Microsoft\nBaseline Security analyzer against\n\n230\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.360\nthe system and I'd find that\nthere was six patches missing.\n\n231\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.280\nI'd go, why it is that WSUS says that\nthe box is fully patched then my\n\n232\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.270\nMicrosoft baseline security analyzer says\nyou're missing six, what's the problem?\n\n233\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.072\n>> Where's the disconnect?\n\n234\n00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:18.860\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n235\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.500\nWell the disconnect is that WSUS is,\nit makes mistakes.\n\n236\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.460\n>> It's not infallible.\n\n237\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.980\n>> That's right, it's not infallible and\n[LAUGH] it says darn Billy Bob left\n\n238\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.617\nthat in the car, thank you for\nthat Guido, sorry.\n\n239\n00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:37.130\n[LAUGH]\nYeah,\n\n240\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.160\nthat's another example of not\ndoing good root cause analysis.\n\n241\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.060\nYou might think that the WSUS server\nis doing what it says it's doing\n\n242\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.520\nbecause it said that it's doing it,\nbut you know what, I don't trust it.\n\n243\n00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.740\n>> Trust but verify, right?\n\n244\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.460\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n245\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.960\n>> That's our motto.\n[LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.370\n>> That should be your mantra, trust but\n\n247\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.610\nverify.\n\n248\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.791\nI always teach less experienced auditors,\n\n249\n00:14:57.791 --> 00:15:03.910\nmy favorite term is prove it,\nand I will challenge your proof.\n\n250\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.666\n>> Are you from Missouri?\n\n251\n00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:05.849\nYeah.\n>> Show me.\n\n252\n00:15:05.849 --> 00:15:08.290\n[LAUGHS]\n>> That's what I do with the MBSA,\n\n253\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.490\nis I challenge the WSUS results.\n\n254\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.310\nBecause I'd used MBSA in\nthe classroom before, and\n\n255\n00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.380\nI knew that it would find\nthings that WSUS did not.\n\n256\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.980\n>> And where I've worked,\nwe definitely learned from our auditors.\n\n257\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.270\nNot just as they gave us a rundown of\n\n258\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.730\nhere's where you're\nfalling down on your face.\n\n259\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.250\nHere's where you can, maybe,\nlook out for something down the road.\n\n260\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.040\nBut we saw the things that they were\ndoing to get to those conclusions, and\n\n261\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.750\nwe started implementing it ourselves.\n\n262\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.270\nThings like running the MBSA.\n\n263\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.630\nIs my WSUS report gonna line up\nwith what my MBSA report says?\n\n264\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.040\nI gotta check that out.\n\n265\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.476\nAnd make sure those things are,\nthey got a synergy going cuz if I don't,\n\n266\n00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:51.983\nI got a problem,\nI got to see where that's falling down.\n\n267\n00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:56.861\n>> Yeah, and even the MBSA, I learned\nafter using it for probably a year or so\n\n268\n00:15:56.861 --> 00:16:01.189\nThat there was a problem with the MBSA and\nI actually got a couple of\n\n269\n00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:05.753\nIT guys in trouble because the MBSA would,\nat times, read a registry\n\n270\n00:16:05.753 --> 00:16:10.636\nentry incorrectly that said that\nthe server needed to be rebooted still,\n\n271\n00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:16.032\nwhen it in fact had been and turned out\nthere was a bug in the N-B-S-A software.\n\n272\n00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:18.326\n[LAUGH]\n>> Never ending.\n\n273\n00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:20.067\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it is it's never ending.\n\n274\n00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:21.657\n>> An uphill fight every day.\n\n275\n00:16:21.657 --> 00:16:25.818\n>> Constantly running using your\ntesting skills to validate and\n\n276\n00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:29.659\nverify that stuff to see if\nit's working effectively for\n\n277\n00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:33.996\nthe organization because it\nreally has some important things.\n\n278\n00:16:33.996 --> 00:16:38.603\nOne of the things that WSUS won't do,\nfor instance, Daniel may or\n\n279\n00:16:38.603 --> 00:16:42.632\nmay not be aware of this,\nis it won't test SQL databases,\n\n280\n00:16:42.632 --> 00:16:47.050\nit only tells you whether or\nnot your system is patched.\n\n281\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.610\nThe Microsoft baseline security\nanalyzer will actually go in and\n\n282\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.900\nlook at any SQL instances on\nthe machine and tell you whether or\n\n283\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.460\nnot there's a blank SA password for\ninstance.\n\n284\n00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.520\nYou won't know that.\n\n285\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.276\nSo when you're looking at vulnerabilities,\nit's a quick and\n\n286\n00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:03.708\neasy I only to bring up the Microsoft\nbaseline security analyzer because it's\n\n287\n00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:05.429\na free tool you can get from Microsoft.\n\n288\n00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:09.479\nI would encourage any of you who are in\nthe art field to learn how to use it.\n\n289\n00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:13.460\nIt's very simple to use,\nvery quick and easy to deal with.\n\n290\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.520\nIt'll tell you a lot about systems that\nyour system admins won't even know\n\n291\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.390\nabout sometimes.\n\n292\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.761\n>> And this will lead you to wonder, maybe\nyou need to go to a third party vendor for\n\n293\n00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:22.898\npatch management.\n\n294\n00:17:22.898 --> 00:17:24.920\nI think we used I've used there's.\n\n295\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.439\n>> All sorts of different\nsystems out there that maybe\n\n296\n00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:32.459\nisn't cutting the mustard even\nthough it's a Microsoft product.\n\n297\n00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:33.074\n>> Right.\n\n298\n00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:36.612\n>> You can go to some other vendor that\nmight be a little more ubiquitous you can\n\n299\n00:17:36.612 --> 00:17:40.530\nwork with third party vendors as well as\ndo all your Microsoft updates as well.\n\n300\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.876\nRoll it all into one management system.\n\n301\n00:17:41.876 --> 00:17:44.327\n>> Right.\n>> Makes ease of use less likely to have\n\n302\n00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:46.108\na mistake, very handy stuff.\n\n303\n00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.709\n>> And that's what we're seeing\nin larger organizations today,\n\n304\n00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:50.260\nwe don't see WSUS used much anymore.\n\n305\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.460\nIt's usually a third party app and\nit usually ties into the ticketing system\n\n306\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.030\nas well so\nthat it does everything all in one system.\n\n307\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.432\nSo, don't want to get too sidetracked on\nthat because we've got a few more items I\n\n308\n00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:01.335\nwant to cover today.\n\n309\n00:18:01.335 --> 00:18:05.909\nBut the point is, to always check with\nyour application vendors as well as your\n\n310\n00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:08.070\noperating system vendors.\n\n311\n00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.400\n>> Whether that, and it might be the same,\nmight be Microsoft as well.\n\n312\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.983\nThey have patch releases for\nOffice products.\n\n313\n00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:20.192\nExcuse me, they have patch releases for\nexchange for SQL.\n\n314\n00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:24.403\nFor all the other products, for\nall the other products that they sell but\n\n315\n00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:27.106\nyou have to check with\ncompanies like Oracle.\n\n316\n00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:32.434\nOracle is a huge player in the IAM market,\nthe identity access management market.\n\n317\n00:18:32.434 --> 00:18:36.320\nThey have hundreds of thousands\nof database products.\n\n318\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.850\nWhat are some of the other apps I'm\nthinking about that you can purchase,\n\n319\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.650\nthat you'll see?\n\n320\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.069\nHR applications,\ntime keeping applications,\n\n321\n00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:49.579\nthings like that like you'll\nsee in the enterprise.\n\n322\n00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:53.509\nCheck with the vendors,\nfind out what they're patching,\n\n323\n00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:57.990\nwhat their patch levels should be,\nand then as Daniels mentioned,\n\n324\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.629\nyou'll need to insure that\nthe organization is using effective third\n\n325\n00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:07.350\nparty application patching systems and\nmechanisms as well.\n\n326\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.430\nMicrosoft does provide\nsome free services and\n\n327\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:15.640\nit has a built-in Windows update feature\nthat will allow you to scan the system.\n\n328\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.401\nAnother great desktop tool that I've\nseen is called Secunia, S-E-C-U-N-I-A.\n\n329\n00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:23.370\nNot to do any advertising for\nthem or that but\n\n330\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.864\nthat's on example where it will\nscan you system for third party and\n\n331\n00:19:27.864 --> 00:19:31.890\nI think now it finally scans for\nMicrosoft updates as well.\n\n332\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.830\nBut it'll scan your system it's\na free product you can use\n\n333\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.525\nthere's a home version\nDoing a commercial product.\n\n334\n00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:40.895\nAnd then, it'll tell you what\napplications you need to be updating and\n\n335\n00:19:40.895 --> 00:19:44.695\ngive you links to go get that information,\nget those patches.\n\n336\n00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:47.905\n>> Yeah, this is definitely something\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n337\n00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:49.835\nWe gotta get a hold of software vendors,\n\n338\n00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:53.225\nmake sure that all of our software is\ngonna play nice with all of our hardware.\n\n339\n00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.935\nWe don't want any fistfights in the yard.\n\n340\n00:19:54.935 --> 00:19:57.292\nWe want it all to be nice and neat.\n\n341\n00:19:57.292 --> 00:20:00.478\nBut that being said,\nonce we do have patches in place,\n\n342\n00:20:00.478 --> 00:20:05.193\nwe have updated the system, sometimes even\nthough our best efforts are put forth\n\n343\n00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:07.640\nthings don't go as well as we would hope.\n\n344\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.010\nWe didn't consider something or\nit just couldn't consider something.\n\n345\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.100\nWe had no foresight for it whatsoever.\n\n346\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.190\nThings don't work and we got to get out of\nthis and we got to go back to the way it\n\n347\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.130\nwas so we can get to a working environment\nBrian, I know you've probably had to deal\n\n348\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.680\nwith that as well, at least, with\npeople that have had to deal with that.\n\n349\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.371\nWhat do we do in that situation?\n\n350\n00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:28.827\n>> Right, well we've talked this in\nother episodes as well and that is,\n\n351\n00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:33.055\nat any time you apply patches of any\nkind or do any kind of upgrades,\n\n352\n00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:38.290\nfirst of all you need to go through\neffective change management procedures.\n\n353\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.600\nThat's something I just keep coming back\nto it, pounding over and over and over.\n\n354\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.270\nThis all ties together\ninto change management.\n\n355\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.700\nBut, and part of that change management\nprocess, is making sure that you\n\n356\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.490\nhave adequate back out procedures,\nin case something doesn't work.\n\n357\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.024\nSo, for instance,\nif you apply a service pack, or\n\n358\n00:20:55.024 --> 00:21:00.794\neven critical updates often times, from\nMicrosoft, that will require a reboot.\n\n359\n00:21:00.794 --> 00:21:01.620\n[LAUGH] A reboot.\n\n360\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.730\nSorry, I lost my tongue there for\na minute.\n\n361\n00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:09.840\nAnd in addition to the reboot,\nif things don't work you may then\n\n362\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.680\nhave to, after the uninstall,\nreboot again, maybe once or twice.\n\n363\n00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.490\nSo, you have to figure that time\nin to your maintenance window\n\n364\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.740\nin the event that something goes haywire\nand in fact, today with Windows 10,\n\n365\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.670\nthis isn't so true on servers.\n\n366\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:33.150\nBut on workstations when it's Windows 10\nit is very common to do a patch upgrade,\n\n367\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:39.560\nreboot, and it will take five to ten\nminutes for that patch to install itself.\n\n368\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.830\nAnd I will come right back up and\nsay rebooting again.\n\n369\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.960\nAnd then it will complete.\n\n370\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.840\nSo, there may be multiple reboots.\n\n371\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.016\nAll that goes back to not only your\neffective change management but\n\n372\n00:21:50.016 --> 00:21:53.428\nhaving a lab to test some of this stuff so\nyou know what's gonna happen.\n\n373\n00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:58.936\nThat way, you know I've sat in CAB\nmeetings before, change action boards,\n\n374\n00:21:58.936 --> 00:22:04.446\nwhere the system administrator how's\nsubmitting the change request says,\n\n375\n00:22:04.446 --> 00:22:07.910\nwell if it doesn't work\nwe'll just back it up.\n\n376\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.859\nThen I say that's not a very good answer,\nwhat do you mean?\n\n377\n00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.400\nWhat does that mean?\n\n378\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.652\nHow many reboots will it take?\n\n379\n00:22:14.652 --> 00:22:18.683\nHow much time will that take, and what\nsystems is that going to impact when you\n\n380\n00:22:18.683 --> 00:22:23.090\ndo that because oftentimes, you know,\ndatabase transactions are being written in\n\n381\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.770\nreal time and if you do a reboot,\nthat can cause all kinds of problems.\n\n382\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.175\nI don't know why I'm having trouble\nwith the word reboot today.\n\n383\n00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:30.440\n[LAUGH] But I am.\n\n384\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.200\nAnyway, so you need to have a very\nsolid plan for backing out changes.\n\n385\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.391\nNot just, yeah, well we'll uninstall it.\n\n386\n00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.900\nYou need to have tested it.\n\n387\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.340\nInstall it on a server and if it works,\nthat is great, go ahead and\n\n388\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.570\nuninstall it to see what\nhappens when you uninstall it.\n\n389\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:54.000\nI know that with certain service packs,\nall kinds of things get upgraded and\n\n390\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.250\nlet's just say that Microsoft's had\na history in the past of, you know,\n\n391\n00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.430\nwhen you uninstall something; for instance\nwhen I uninstall an Office product,\n\n392\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.170\nit may leave two or\nthree instances of SQL behind.\n\n393\n00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.420\nBecause it doesn't think that it hurts\nanything to leave those on your system and\n\n394\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.312\nit very well could leave\nvulnerabilities behind.\n\n395\n00:23:11.312 --> 00:23:12.642\nThat's [CROSSTALK].\n\n396\n00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:14.140\n>> That's something you wanna avoid.\n\n397\n00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.780\n>> Yeah. And [CROSSTALK]. >> I've\ndefinitely have run into that before.\n\n398\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.330\nI remember they used to have\na little tool that was amazing.\n\n399\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.040\nIt would remove anything on your system.\n\n400\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.966\n>> Associated with it.\n>> Yeah.\n\n401\n00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:24.463\nAnd just anything.\n\n402\n00:23:24.463 --> 00:23:25.875\nAnd of course they snatched\nthat from the public domain.\n\n403\n00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:26.768\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n404\n00:23:26.768 --> 00:23:27.847\n>> I think I still have a copy\nrunning around somewhere.\n\n405\n00:23:27.847 --> 00:23:28.983\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> It was great.\n\n406\n00:23:28.983 --> 00:23:29.920\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n407\n00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.379\nExactly.\nI wish they would do that because on\n\n408\n00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:35.564\ngenerally on Linux systems\nthen on the Apple systems,\n\n409\n00:23:35.564 --> 00:23:40.272\nthat's the same thing is true is when you\ndo when you wanna install an application\n\n410\n00:23:40.272 --> 00:23:44.380\nit will generally then install all\nthe associating features with it.\n\n411\n00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.252\nAnd tracks that stuff as you install it.\n\n412\n00:23:46.252 --> 00:23:50.346\nWindows 10 does a much better job of that\ntoday because of the way it's moving\n\n413\n00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.157\ntowards the same kind of systems.\n\n414\n00:23:52.157 --> 00:23:58.055\nWhen you're doing rolling updates\nrather than whole versions.\n\n415\n00:23:58.055 --> 00:24:01.286\nIt's easier to track or it's more\nimportant to track all that stuff so\n\n416\n00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:01.793\nit works.\n\n417\n00:24:01.793 --> 00:24:05.537\nSo the last thing I wanna talk about cuz\nwe're starting to run out of time here is\n\n418\n00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:08.400\nto talk a little bit about\nsetting up a maintenance window.\n\n419\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.840\nIt's really important that the IT\norganization has a well known and\n\n420\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.730\npublished maintenance window.\n\n421\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.780\nSo that you are not doing upgrades and\npatches and\n\n422\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.240\nreboots at all weird hours of the day,\nweird days and nights and\n\n423\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.810\nevenings abd you might think of, well as\nlong as we do it after hours that's okay.\n\n424\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.800\nBut you will often times forget that\nyou have remote users logged in,\n\n425\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.745\nyou may have the sea levels logged\nin at night doing work after hours.\n\n426\n00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:35.970\nAlmost none of work eight to five anymore,\nso\n\n427\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.450\nyou have to be very careful\nwhen you do those things.\n\n428\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.320\nIf you have a routine published\nmaintenance window for\n\n429\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.500\nanything other than emergencies,\neverybody knows that third Saturday\n\n430\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.160\nof the month between 12 AM and\n\n431\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.110\n6 AM Sunday morning, that's when all the\nupgrades in the network are gonna happen.\n\n432\n00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.610\nThey've been completely tested, etc.\n\n433\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:03.900\nIn addition to that,\neven though you have one, it's important\n\n434\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.610\nthat the IT organization also remind users\nevery month that they're doing that.\n\n435\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.740\nOr if it's an emergency update,\nwhen it's gonna happen,\n\n436\n00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.450\nwhat systems will be affected, etc.\n\n437\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.810\nBecause the end users\ndon't pay any attention.\n\n438\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.690\nThey could care less what you're\ndoing as a system administrator.\n\n439\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:29.250\nThey're out there busy trying to do their\njob and I get this notification from\n\n440\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.460\nmy bank all the time that they're gonna\nbe doing an upgrade on Saturday night.\n\n441\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.040\nBecause I don't care what their IT does,\nI just want to know whether or\n\n442\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.840\nnot I can get to my money.\n\n443\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.460\nSo it's important that the IT\norganization, not you as the auditor, but\n\n444\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.190\nthe IT organization is following these\nkinds of policies and procedures and\n\n445\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:51.790\nmodels so that they impact\nthe organization the least possible\n\n446\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.940\nand streamline operations so\nthat work can continue.\n\n447\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.580\nAnd at the same time risk continues\nto be managed at acceptable levels.\n\n448\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.620\n>> Yeah I used to send out a blast\nemail to the entire company saying\n\n449\n00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.700\nwe're rolling out updates for\nyour Windows operating system tonight so\n\n450\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.570\nbe aware that it might reboot at 3AM or\nwhatever we set it to.\n\n451\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.500\nAnd then, every now and then,\nI have to go out to an office and I say,\n\n452\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.020\n\" I'm Daniel with IT and they go,\nyou're the guy that does the updates.\n\n453\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.405\nAnd I'm like, yeah, I'm infamous.\n\n454\n00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:24.200\n[LAUGH].\nThey're like, we hate you.\n\n455\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.710\nBecause every time an update goes up,\nsomething breaks.\n\n456\n00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.290\nI'm like, it's not my fault,\nI have to do this.\n\n457\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.160\n>> So you know what it feels\nlike to be an auditor.\n\n458\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.890\n>> Exactly, that's it.\n\n459\n00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.740\n>> Anyway, that's all I have for\nthis episode.\n\n460\n00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.800\n>> Well it's excellent stuff, and\nwe do appreciate you stopping by and\n\n461\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.120\ninforming us so we can be better\nprepared for our CISA exam.\n\n462\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.240\nThat being said, you are right.\n\n463\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.420\nWe are well out of time for this episode\nso we're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n464\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.310\nDon't forget to grab a copy of the book\nthat you can't see the back of.\n\n465\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.710\nHere it is, CISA,\n4th Edition of the study guide.\n\n466\n00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.830\nThat is one of the authors right\nthere next to me, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n467\n00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.350\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n468\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.550\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n469\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.260\nFor ITProTV I have been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n470\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.280\n>> And I am Brian O'Hara.\n\n471\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.804\n>> We will see you next time.\n\n472\n00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:12.290\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:18.067\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:22.431\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with our series on CISA,\n\n5\n00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:25.721\nthat is\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n6\n00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.851\nJoining us in the studio today,\none of the authors of our study guide,\n\n7\n00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.112\nthe fourth edition.\n\n8\n00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:36.499\nHe lended his hand in writing,\nthat is our good friend, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:38.182\nBrian, welcome back to the show today,\nhow is it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:38.889\n>> Hi, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:39.411\nIt is going well.\n\n12\n00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:40.211\nThank you.\n\n13\n00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:44.252\nHello, everybody out\nthere in ITProTV land.\n\n14\n00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:49.453\nToday, we're gonna continue the series\non IS operations, maintenance, etc.\n\n15\n00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:54.283\nWith this particular episode\ntalking about database management.\n\n16\n00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.498\nAs an IT auditor,\nwe're not expected to, nor\n\n17\n00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:05.003\nwould I ask anyone to try and\nlearn the fine art of database management.\n\n18\n00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.004\nHowever, there are some fundamentals\nthat you need to be aware of and\n\n19\n00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.004\nyou need to understand in order to\nnot only pass the CISA exam, but for\n\n20\n00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.211\nyou to be able to be a good\nauditor out in the field.\n\n21\n00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:19.382\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about\nthings that you can look at with regards\n\n22\n00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:24.004\nto database management to be able to\nadvise your oddities as to whether or\n\n23\n00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:29.083\nnot policy and procedure are being\nfollowed correctly based on the companies,\n\n24\n00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:33.681\nand organizations strategy to make\nsure that risk is being minimized.\n\n25\n00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:38.111\nAnd most importantly, in the world of\ndatabases, what we're most concerned with\n\n26\n00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.820\nis the completeness and\naccuracy of database transactions.\n\n27\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.339\nWe want to make sure that data is written\nto the database correctly the first time,\n\n28\n00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.313\nthat there are no multiple writes.\n\n29\n00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:53.838\nAnd that, we also have active or\naccurate logging of those\n\n30\n00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:58.914\ntransactions and\nalso the ability to do restores from\n\n31\n00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:04.130\nbackups should we lose data\nin some kind of emergency.\n\n32\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.756\nSo we'll start off by talking a little\nbit, I'll do a little review on storage.\n\n33\n00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:15.231\nIn the previous episode,\nwe talked about Flash drives and\n\n34\n00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:20.240\nRAID arrays and SANS and\nNAS and removal media.\n\n35\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.953\nToday, I just simply wanna talk a little\nbit about how in the database world we\n\n36\n00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:27.796\ntalk about putting data stores,\nif you will.\n\n37\n00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:36.420\nThat may be tables or complete\ndatabases on varying speeds of data.\n\n38\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.248\nWhat's the term I need?\nStorage subsystems.\n\n39\n00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:45.600\nSo for instance, if you have a database\nthat's being constantly pounded,\n\n40\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.190\nread from and written to.\n\n41\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.690\nConstantly, you probably want to\nkeep that database on high-speed,\n\n42\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.440\nbut expensive Flash media storage.\n\n43\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.720\nThat gives you the absolute\nbest performance, the reads and\n\n44\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.020\nwrites are extremely fast.\n\n45\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.310\nHowever, Flash storage will wear out\nmuch faster than spending drive storage.\n\n46\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.330\nAny Flash media has\na acceptable life limit,\n\n47\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.750\nit's actually more\nwrites than it is reads.\n\n48\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.370\nSo there's a number of ways you can\noptimize that, but the bottom line is if\n\n49\n00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.640\nyou need very quick access to the data or\nif you need access to it often\n\n50\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.270\nputting it on a fast storage medium\nis probably a smart way to go.\n\n51\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.100\nNow secondarily say, for instance,\nyou have a database where,\n\n52\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.240\nperhaps prices on a product are being\nqueried on a very regular basis.\n\n53\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.721\nYou might wanna store that information\non your Flash storage, but\n\n54\n00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:51.241\nlet's say,\nthe actual images get cached and ran and\n\n55\n00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:55.179\ndon't have to be pulled up\nfrom media storage very often.\n\n56\n00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:59.656\nYou can put those on slower\nmaybe spinning discs or SAN or\n\n57\n00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:05.612\neven NAS devices for that matter plus\nimages tend to take up a lot of room.\n\n58\n00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:09.876\nAnd so we typically,\nbecause Flash storage is so expensive,\n\n59\n00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:15.207\nwe don't wanna use up that space for\nthings that are not accessed very often.\n\n60\n00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:19.512\nSo a lot of times, you'll see catalog\nimages stored on slower medium,\n\n61\n00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:20.670\nthings like that.\n\n62\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.928\nThings that don't need to be\naccessed quite as quickly.\n\n63\n00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:27.050\nYou're beginning to see now why in\nthe previous episode knowing and\n\n64\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.049\nunderstanding those different kinds of\ntechnologies, and where they're used, and\n\n65\n00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:34.333\nhow effective they can be used is\nimportant here when we start to talking\n\n66\n00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.660\nabout databases and\nother types of data storage.\n\n67\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.410\nSo, the last part of that conversation\nabout storage is the slowest.\n\n68\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.450\nSo now,\nwe're talking about spinning drives.\n\n69\n00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.300\nUsually in database management,\nyou don't ever put anything on a tape\n\n70\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.870\nunless it's for\nrestoration from back up purposes.\n\n71\n00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.640\nBy slower drives,\nwhat I mean are not 10,000 or\n\n72\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.623\n15,000 RPM scuzzy drive,\nbut slower slated drives.\n\n73\n00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:06.280\n50, 400 to 7,200 RPM spinning drives.\n\n74\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.993\nThey may even be on an external array,\nsomething like that.\n\n75\n00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:13.040\nOr you can get to them fairly quickly,\nbut they're cheap discs.\n\n76\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.520\nYou can put very large amounts\nof data stored on them.\n\n77\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.832\nYou may even, for instance,\nas data ages on the Flash\n\n78\n00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:27.590\nstorage where perhaps today read and\nwrite to it a lot.\n\n79\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.194\nBut in 30 days,\nit becomes almost obsolete.\n\n80\n00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:34.765\nYou may wanna then move that\ndata from your database over\n\n81\n00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:38.590\nto slower storage for\narchival purposes etc.\n\n82\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.566\nThe idea is that you're trying\nto manage the resources,\n\n83\n00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:47.720\nthe most effective way\nyou can in terms of cost.\n\n84\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.714\nThe faster the media storage is,\nthe more expensive it is and\n\n85\n00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:56.485\nthe quicker it will wear out and\nforce you to buy a new again.\n\n86\n00:05:56.485 --> 00:06:01.468\nSo, we talked about storage.\n\n87\n00:06:01.468 --> 00:06:03.930\nNow, I want to talk about database design.\n\n88\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.764\nAnd again, I'm only gonna\ntouch the big chunks of this.\n\n89\n00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:10.526\nYou're not expected to be\na database designer, but\n\n90\n00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:13.360\nyou need to know a little bit\nabout how this all works.\n\n91\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.670\nDatabases, oftentimes are built for\nspeed, but\n\n92\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.937\nas important is accuracy,\nso that you don't pull back\n\n93\n00:06:24.937 --> 00:06:30.102\nerroneous results when you\ndo searches in database.\n\n94\n00:06:30.102 --> 00:06:32.482\nDatabases tend to become fairly large and\n\n95\n00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:35.775\nwe're generally talking\nabout relational databases.\n\n96\n00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:40.560\nI had a conversation with one of the other\nfolks here at ITProTV earlier today about\n\n97\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.582\nwhat are called object oriented databases,\nwhich is something that\n\n98\n00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:48.185\nis really not talked much about\nin the CISA exam material, but\n\n99\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:51.471\nsomething that I'm still\nlearning a little bit about.\n\n100\n00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.335\nIt's kind of a different\napproach to databases and\n\n101\n00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:58.940\ntraditional relational databases,\nwhich is what we're talking mostly about.\n\n102\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.636\nIt's important when looking at\ndatabase design that transactions\n\n103\n00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:11.078\ncan be replicated very easily and\nthat you can verify, and validate\n\n104\n00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:17.019\nboth the integrity of the transactions,\nand the availability of those.\n\n105\n00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:21.856\nI mentioned for the very first time in\nthe previous episode about what we call\n\n106\n00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:26.920\nthe security triad or confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n107\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.225\nIf any of those three legs of that\ntriad are compromised in any way,\n\n108\n00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:36.323\nyou've broken the trust model or\nsecurity model.\n\n109\n00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:40.487\nSo for instance, if you have transactions\nthat are in fact accurate, but\n\n110\n00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:44.910\nyou can't retrieve them,\nthey might as well not have happened.\n\n111\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.969\nIf they're available, but they're not\naccurate, you might as well not have them.\n\n112\n00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:59.059\nSo it's extremely important that they\nbe both validated and available.\n\n113\n00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:01.439\nThen we also wanna talk\nabout confidentiality.\n\n114\n00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.528\nThat`s the third leg\nof the security triad.\n\n115\n00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:10.408\nIs the database designed for instance,\nto what we call mask certain numbers.\n\n116\n00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:13.583\nIs the database storing\nsecurity numbers or\n\n117\n00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:17.368\nwe might call personal\nidentifiable information?\n\n118\n00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:21.885\nWe have ways today in databases to\nmask those numbers so that we can see,\n\n119\n00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:24.238\nmany of probably heard this before.\n\n120\n00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:29.226\nWhere you might have to do some kind of\nvalidation when you make a phone call\n\n121\n00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:31.328\nto a company of your identity.\n\n122\n00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:34.760\nAnd they'll ask you for the last four\ndigits of your social security number.\n\n123\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.490\nThat's probably because the first\nsix are starred out, or masked, so\n\n124\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.470\nthey can't see them anyway,\nall they can see is the last four.\n\n125\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.230\nAnd they're taking the chance\nthat your knowing the last\n\n126\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.908\nfour is good enough to\nvalidate who you are.\n\n127\n00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:55.477\nSo I wanna talk about confidentiality and\nlooking at the databases,\n\n128\n00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:58.798\nwhere that PII is stored,\nasking the questions.\n\n129\n00:08:58.798 --> 00:09:02.470\nCan it be masked, can it be encrypted?\n\n130\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.500\nI'm going to talk in a minute\nabout encryption more in detail.\n\n131\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.900\nSo anytime there's personally\nidentifiable information,\n\n132\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.240\nemail addresses, full names,\ndate of births, that kind of information.\n\n133\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.103\nYou want to be able to mask it to\nthe extent that the only thing revealed is\n\n134\n00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:27.288\nwhat the user of the database application\nabsolutely must have access to.\n\n135\n00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:32.223\nSo it might be again a tool used for\npassword resetting or\n\n136\n00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:35.058\nsomething on a secure web site.\n\n137\n00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:40.006\nWhere the internal person doesn't\nneed to know anything other than\n\n138\n00:09:40.006 --> 00:09:41.668\nthe last four digits.\n\n139\n00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:46.440\nOne of the things that's often used for\nin active directory and\n\n140\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.668\npassword resets is you have to set or you\nhave the ability to set a password secret.\n\n141\n00:09:52.668 --> 00:09:57.418\nWhen you setup your active directory\nsay what's your password secret hint.\n\n142\n00:09:57.418 --> 00:10:01.420\nAnd that should, that will actually\nappear to the help desk people.\n\n143\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.280\nWhile they can't see your password they\ncan see the hint, and to verify and\n\n144\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.120\nvalidate who you are,\nthey can ask you for what that hint was.\n\n145\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.490\nAnd, if you remember it and\nyou give it to them accurately,\n\n146\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.390\nthey're gonna assume that\nyou are who you say you are.\n\n147\n00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.120\nAnd they'll go ahead and\nreset your password for you.\n\n148\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.320\nSo, in looking at database design,\n\n149\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.680\nit's important to make sure that\nyou ask those kinds of questions.\n\n150\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.420\nIs personally identifiable\ninformation in the database.\n\n151\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.570\nIf so, is it properly masked,\nencrypted, and or protected.\n\n152\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.070\nNow not only in the database,\nbut this is where\n\n153\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.560\nyou really start to see things come\ntogether in terms of their connectivity.\n\n154\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.380\nWhat about the backups?\n\n155\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.648\nDaniel has worked with backups in the past\nbefore in system administration positions.\n\n156\n00:10:42.648 --> 00:10:45.948\nBut what happens if you have\n35 backups of a database and\n\n157\n00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:48.578\nyou discover that there's\na field in there.\n\n158\n00:10:48.578 --> 00:10:51.152\nThat contains someone's\nsocial security number or\n\n159\n00:10:51.152 --> 00:10:53.438\nthousands of users\nsocial security numbers?\n\n160\n00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:56.479\nNow you've got 35 copies of that\ndatabase floating around and\n\n161\n00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:58.738\nyou need to make sure that\nyou find all of those.\n\n162\n00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:02.977\nAnd get those cleaned up and\neither encrypted or screened or\n\n163\n00:11:02.977 --> 00:11:04.600\nsomething like that.\n\n164\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.570\nSo those are some of\nthe questions that those provide.\n\n165\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.490\nNow I wanna talk a little bit about\nencryption because this one's a very\n\n166\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.870\ncommonly misunderstood concept.\n\n167\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.997\nAnd that is encryption in\na database Is only used to\n\n168\n00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:26.670\nprotect access after a theft.\n\n169\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.640\nLet me say more about that.\n\n170\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.970\nIf I'm a hacker, and\nI break into a database, chances are I've\n\n171\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:42.770\nalready got what we call the superuser or\nSA account password.\n\n172\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.080\nWith that password, doesn't matter\nif the database is encrypted or not,\n\n173\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.330\nI can get access to\nthe database information.\n\n174\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.860\nSo if I can compromise that,\nI've got access to the database.\n\n175\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.135\nWhat encryption protects you\nfrom is someone stealing it\n\n176\n00:11:56.135 --> 00:11:59.115\nwho doesn't know what that password is.\n\n177\n00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:03.825\nAnd it prevents them from being able to\nview the information in the database.\n\n178\n00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:07.196\nWithout the password to the SA\naccount they can't view anything,\n\n179\n00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:08.953\nit's all encrypted gobbly gook.\n\n180\n00:12:08.953 --> 00:12:11.433\nSo it really only protects you from theft.\n\n181\n00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:13.889\nWhich is why you hear in the news and\n\n182\n00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:19.668\nyou read in security feeds about the\nimportance of doing hard drive encryption.\n\n183\n00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:23.000\nOr whole drive encryption\nas it's called now, WDE.\n\n184\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.010\nSo that if my laptop here for\n\n185\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.080\ninstance is completely encrypted,\nif I were to lose this or it were stolen.\n\n186\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.370\nYou could pull the hard drive out of it,\nyou could bang away on it all day.\n\n187\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.450\nUnless you know what my password is to get\npast that encryption you're not gonna be\n\n188\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.070\nable to read the data on it\nin any way shape or form.\n\n189\n00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.710\nIf it were not encrypted,\nI could use password cracking tools,\n\n190\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.880\nI could do all, in fact I might not\neven have to use a password crack.\n\n191\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.490\nI might be able to plug it into an\nexternal bay, plug into another Mac, and\n\n192\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.710\nread it directly off the other Mac.\n\n193\n00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.400\nIt just depends on how it's protected, and\nwhether it's protected properly or not.\n\n194\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.320\nSo encryption is primarily\nused to protect us from theft.\n\n195\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.180\nIt's not designed to protect\nus from being hacked.\n\n196\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.750\nThat's a very common misunderstanding\nmost people don't get.\n\n197\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.475\n>> Although, hackers are typically\nafter things like databases,\n\n198\n00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:13.368\nbecause that's where\nall the good stuff is.\n\n199\n00:13:13.368 --> 00:13:16.606\n>> Exactly, well,\nit's because if you steal the database,\n\n200\n00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:20.440\na database can be humongous in terms\nof the amount of data stored in it.\n\n201\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.980\nVersus, what good is a Word file?\n\n202\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.740\n>> Yeah not much.\n\n203\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.320\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n204\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.115\n>> Unless it's a Word file of passwords.\n\n205\n00:13:26.115 --> 00:13:26.665\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n206\n00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:28.195\n>> Then it's a great one.\n\n207\n00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:29.450\n>> There's a good\n\n208\n00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.365\none.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:31.308\n>> So then the last\n\n210\n00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:36.033\npiece I want to talk about with that\nis talking about database optimization.\n\n211\n00:13:36.033 --> 00:13:37.639\nDatabase developers and\n\n212\n00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:42.313\nadministrators can talk to you in much\nmore detail about this than I can.\n\n213\n00:13:42.313 --> 00:13:46.097\nBut really what we're talking about is,\n\n214\n00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:51.070\nis the table structure and\ndesign in the database built\n\n215\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.812\neffectively enough.\nThat the database performs the objectives\n\n216\n00:13:56.812 --> 00:14:01.313\nthat it was designed to\ncomplete in the first place?\n\n217\n00:14:01.313 --> 00:14:04.661\nSo an example might be if the database\n\n218\n00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:09.953\ndesigner has done a poor job\nlinking tables, and creating\n\n219\n00:14:09.953 --> 00:14:14.867\nwhat are called keys amongst the tables.\nIt may take a very\n\n220\n00:14:14.867 --> 00:14:18.130\nlong time to do certain types of searches.\n\n221\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.000\nThose tables can be reorganized and\nreoptimized so\n\n222\n00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.800\nthat the searches happen faster.\n\n223\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.630\nThere's two purposes of a database.\n\n224\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.530\nOne is to store information, and one\nis to query information back out of it.\n\n225\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.440\nThat's really the purpose of a database.\n\n226\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.490\nYou write in a password,\nboom, you store it.\n\n227\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.658\nYou put in a social security number,\nyou store it.\n\n228\n00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:44.389\nYou put in a birthdate, you store it, and\nthen later on someone says tell me about\n\n229\n00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:46.908\nall the people who were\nborn in that month.\n\n230\n00:14:46.908 --> 00:14:50.970\nOr that year or like red shoes or\nspend this much money.\n\n231\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.410\nSo it's writing to an querying from.\n\n232\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.070\nSo that query process, there may\nbe 1,000 tables involved in this.\n\n233\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:07.570\nAnd the query process goes through\na yes no sort of a boolean\n\n234\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.940\nlogic in trying to find what you're asking\nfor and it goes until it hits a yes.\n\n235\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.400\nIt goes no, no, no, no, no,\nyes and it finds the data.\n\n236\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.360\nThe way it goes through that chain of noes\ncan be impacted by moving tables around,\n\n237\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.550\nrearranging the connections, etc.\n\n238\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.693\nSo if you've got slow\ndatabase performance,\n\n239\n00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:33.698\nit's not always because your hardware's\nwearing out or not producing.\n\n240\n00:15:33.698 --> 00:15:38.318\nIt's not always because your Internet\nconnected speed is not fast enough.\n\n241\n00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:43.774\nIt oftentimes is because your\ndatabase tables are not optimized for\n\n242\n00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:46.280\noptimal search performance.\n\n243\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.120\n>> And they can do things like, if I'm\nnot mistaken, in SQL they do indexing.\n\n244\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.620\n>> Correct.\n\n245\n00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.590\n>> And\nthis helps speed up the querying process.\n\n246\n00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.138\n>> We even do that in Windows.\n\n247\n00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:56.872\nIn Windows or\n\n248\n00:15:56.872 --> 00:16:01.287\non the Mac platform there's a process on\nthe Mac where I can tell it to reindex.\n\n249\n00:16:01.287 --> 00:16:04.748\nWhat's called Spotlight, which is\nthe search engine in Microsoft Outlook.\n\n250\n00:16:04.748 --> 00:16:08.144\nYou can actually tell it to go back\nthere and it'll re-index all of your\n\n251\n00:16:08.144 --> 00:16:11.780\ne-mail stuff so that you can do\nsearches and it'll find things faster.\n\n252\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.740\n>> Incredibly faster.\n\n253\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.227\nI've done the re indexing myself,\nand it's like, [SOUND] [SOUND].\n\n254\n00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:16.650\nThings speed up really quickly.\n\n255\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.150\n>> Yes.\n\n256\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.370\nYes, it does.\n\n257\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:24.390\nSo, that has to do with database design\nand some of the features of databases.\n\n258\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.590\nNow, I want to talk a little bit,\nwhile we still have some time left,\n\n259\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.510\nabout different database roles.\n\n260\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.490\nAnd, I don't mean the kind that you\ngo get at the grocery store but\n\n261\n00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:38.570\nthe roles of database,\npeople who touch databases, okay?\n\n262\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.070\nThe first one is the data owner.\n\n263\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.560\nThese are terms that you'll need to know,\nwink, wink, wink.\n\n264\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.889\nThere's very specific\ndefinitions in the book.\n\n265\n00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:55.000\nThe data owner is, for instance, if the\nDaniel were my exchange administrator and\n\n266\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.990\nI had an exchange account with\nemail in there, that data's mine.\n\n267\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.750\nI own that data, okay?\n\n268\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.170\nAnd, I'm the one who should be\nable to say, to some degree,\n\n269\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.510\nwhen I want to archive it or\nback it up or move it.\n\n270\n00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.320\nI can move it from folder to folder.\n\n271\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.760\nI can change the table layout\nbecause I'm the data owner.\n\n272\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:20.590\nThe data custodian is the person who is\nin charge of ensuring that the data is\n\n273\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:26.310\nnot only available for use, but available\nfor recovery should something happen.\n\n274\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:31.180\nSo, a data custodian not just is in\ncharge of backups and backup media,\n\n275\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.740\netcetera, but ensuring that the database\nremains in good enough shape that\n\n276\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:41.180\nI can continue to access the information\nwhen I want, how I want, etcetera.\n\n277\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.230\nThen there's the database administrator.\n\n278\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.380\nThe database administrator, for\ninstance, might be an exchange.\n\n279\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.440\nAgain, we'll go back because exchange and\nemail really is simply a database.\n\n280\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.790\nNot much different than active directory.\n\n281\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:58.160\nAn exchange administrator, for instance,\nor a database and SQL administrator might\n\n282\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.330\nbe involved with re-optimizing the tables\nthat like we just talked about,\n\n283\n00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.520\nthat would be a database\nadministrator's function.\n\n284\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:12.160\nAny new tables that might be created,\nthe database administrator would create.\n\n285\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.360\nIf we decided to delete tables or\nchange tables inside a database,\n\n286\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.480\nthe database administrator\nwould typically be doing that.\n\n287\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.360\nAnd, this goes back to\nthe concept I introduced in\n\n288\n00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.630\na number of sessions earlier\nabout separation of duties.\n\n289\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.770\nYou don't want the data owner\ndoing the data administration, and\n\n290\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.390\nyou don't want the data administrator\ndoing the data custodian work.\n\n291\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.980\nYou want those functions separated so\n\n292\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.900\nthat there's, you don't have\nsomeone who's the data owner\n\n293\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.850\ndoing something with data administrative\ncapabilities, that might not be kosher.\n\n294\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.800\nThey might be doing things\nthat they shouldn't be doing.\n\n295\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.240\nSo, those should be in large\norganizations broken out.\n\n296\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.050\nNow, in the real world just like I've\ntalked about many times in this series\n\n297\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.950\nISOC is an international organization.\n\n298\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:02.710\nThey have a tendency to talk about\nthings at a very high level with big,\n\n299\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.910\nlarge, or enterprises.\n\n300\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.410\nIn most medium to small size companies,\n\n301\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.920\nthe same person wears\nall three of these hats.\n\n302\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.640\nOkay, and\nyou can't really separate the duties.\n\n303\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.980\nYou just have to be able to provide\nbetter oversight and do the best you can.\n\n304\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.932\nYou can't really punish anyone for\ndoing the best that they can.\n\n305\n00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:23.515\n>> Well, you can, its just not fair.\n\n306\n00:19:23.515 --> 00:19:24.487\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n307\n00:19:24.487 --> 00:19:29.136\none more thing I wanted to talk about was\nhow this all ties back to, again change\n\n308\n00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:33.797\nmanagement, I know you're getting tired\nof hearing it, but it really does.\n\n309\n00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:39.223\nIt all ties back to team change management\nwhere the data custodian is called\n\n310\n00:19:39.223 --> 00:19:44.930\nupon to do a data restore, because\nsomething's happened to a database table.\n\n311\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.120\nIt's become corrupt, or\nmaybe the entire database is corrupted.\n\n312\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.290\nAll that stuff needs to go through\na change management process.\n\n313\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.890\nIt's very important that you\nstick to those processes.\n\n314\n00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.830\nThen the last thing in wrapping up for\n\n315\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.240\nthis session we'll talk about\nis the data life cycle.\n\n316\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.390\nNow, this is a little different\nthan the STLC we've talked about,\n\n317\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.160\nwhich was Systems Developement Life Cycle\nor Software Developement Life Cycle.\n\n318\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.290\nNow, we're talking about\nthe data life cycle.\n\n319\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:17.300\nAnd, what we're talking about is,\nmy wife is a physician and\n\n320\n00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.760\nshe calls it cradle to grave,\nwhich is actually a great analogy to this.\n\n321\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.910\nShe's a family physician so\nshe delivers babies,\n\n322\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.550\nshe takes care of terminally ill patients\nsometimes, and everything in between.\n\n323\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.190\nSo, what we're talking about\nin terms of data life cycle is\n\n324\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.170\neverything from the creation of\nthe actual data, the database, and\n\n325\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.900\nthe actual input into the database.\n\n326\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.910\nTo management of the database, the day\nto day operations of administration,\n\n327\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.670\nmaking backups, the care and\nfeeding of that database, if you will,\n\n328\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.450\nover whatever its lifespan is.\n\n329\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.260\nAnd then,\n\n330\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.160\nthat goes into, how do we handle the aging\nof those records or that information?\n\n331\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.850\nDo we move it off to slower,\nless costly storage?\n\n332\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.910\nWhat's the plan for it at it's,\nwhat we would call, end of life.\n\n333\n00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.330\nOkay, which takes us\nfrom aging to retention.\n\n334\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.230\nWhat's your company's retention or\nwhat's their retention policy for data?\n\n335\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:21.000\nAnd this is the one that really,\nthe last two are really I think more\n\n336\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.630\nimportant than most people like to talk\nabout and that is what is your retention?\n\n337\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.500\nHow long are you keeping data?\n\n338\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.690\nAnd then, most critically,\n\n339\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.040\nwhat happens when it reaches\nthe end of that life cycle?\n\n340\n00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.620\nHow do you destroy the data?\n\n341\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.410\nWhat's your destruction policy,\nprocesses, and procedure?\n\n342\n00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.800\nHere's a great example.\n\n343\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.270\nI will go into an organization and\n\n344\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.790\none of the first things I\nwill do is a data discovery.\n\n345\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.960\nI'll actually run some utilities, scan\nthe network, looking for spreadsheets,\n\n346\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.640\nword documents with credit\ncard numbers in them,\n\n347\n00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.280\nsocial security numbers, etcetera that\npeople have accumulated over the years.\n\n348\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.400\nThey've forgotten about it.\n\n349\n00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.630\nThey put it in their email.\n\n350\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.180\nThey sent it to their brothers\nwho works in another department.\n\n351\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.220\nThe next thing you know, you've got\npersonally identifiable information\n\n352\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.369\nall over the network, causing all\nkinds of risk to the organization.\n\n353\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.770\nSo, we want to identify and\nlocate that information and destroy it.\n\n354\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.480\nMake sure that it's properly and\nadequately destroyed based on retention\n\n355\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.240\npolicies, and\nbased on sound security practices.\n\n356\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.450\nThat's harder than it may seem, and\nthe reason most people leave it alone or\n\n357\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.210\nmost companies leave it alone,\nforget about it is.\n\n358\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.660\nWell, it's just easier to leave it.\n\n359\n00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.130\nWe might need it some day.\n\n360\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.930\nI can't tell you how many times I\nhear that from companies that say,\n\n361\n00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.530\nwell we still have that database and\nwe just turn the machine off but\n\n362\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.260\nwe're afraid we might need it sometime.\n\n363\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.520\nWell how long you've been holding it?\n\n364\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.610\nSince '96 or '97.\n\n365\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.391\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nwell you are probably not going to use it.\n\n366\n00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:53.759\nIt's kind of like those jeans or\nthat t shirt that you really,\n\n367\n00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:57.290\nreally love that is just\nshredded beyond belief.\n\n368\n00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.220\nOr, when you put it on,\npeople look at you and go,\n\n369\n00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.060\n\"That stinks.\"\n>> I say old databases are like taxes,\n\n370\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.760\nafter seven years, ditch them.\n\n371\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.280\n>> That's right.\n\n372\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.450\nThat's right, ditch them.\n\n373\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.940\nSo, again, we've got creation, management,\naging, retention and destruction.\n\n374\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.670\nIn terms of the stages\nof that data life cycle.\n\n375\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.600\nAnd, it's extremely important that\nthe data be destroyed when it's\n\n376\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.730\nno longer needed.\n\n377\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.840\nAnd, done so properly though data\nscrubbing, whether that be put\n\n378\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.630\non to hard drives, that mans you have\nto find all the backups, everything.\n\n379\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.978\nAnd, that sometimes is a tougher\njob than you might think.\n\n380\n00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:36.896\nDoing proper inventory of your media\nhelps with that, your backups, etcetera,\n\n381\n00:23:36.896 --> 00:23:38.060\netcetera.\n\n382\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.930\n>> You know it's funny, you were talking\nabout really the human factor that comes\n\n383\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.720\nin where we say it's just easier to do\nthis, or it's just easier to do that.\n\n384\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.130\nIt's not easier to go\nthrough a security audit and\n\n385\n00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.750\nget hammered because you're doing things\nthat are putting your company at risk.\n\n386\n00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.510\nI remember having a user, and she had\naccess to a database that she was backing\n\n387\n00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.520\nup to a flash drive and\ntaking home with her every night.\n\n388\n00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.750\nAnd, you know how I found this out?\n\n389\n00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.320\nBecause her computer,\n\n390\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.740\nher workstation at her desk kept\ngetting infected with malware.\n\n391\n00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.520\nAnd, I'm running antivirus scans\non this thing on a daily basis.\n\n392\n00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.680\nHow are you continuing, what websites\nare you going to, I'm looking at logs, and\n\n393\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.950\nwhat she's doing.\n\n394\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.480\nWhat I didn't know was\nthat little thumb drive,\n\n395\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.640\nthat she was taking home,\nthat she plugged into her home computer,\n\n396\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.620\nwas getting infected and\nthen bringing it home.\n\n397\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.520\nI said, you can't do that.\n\n398\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.550\nShe goes, well I have this database on\nthere I need to be able to work with it.\n\n399\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.230\nI go, we can set you up with a VPN\nconnection, everything's encrypted and\n\n400\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.090\nsecure.\n\n401\n00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.760\nYou don't have to worry about\nbringing this thing back and forth.\n\n402\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.940\nWhat if you get hit by\na bus on the way to work?\n\n403\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.340\n>> Right.\n>> And this is database is now gone.\n\n404\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.860\nAll the changes that you've made.\n\n405\n00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.390\nAll these sensitive information is\non the street, literally right?\n\n406\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.690\nBecause you were taking\na flash drive back and forth.\n\n407\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:49.040\nShe argued with me about that, and I said,\nyou cannot do, this is why we do back ups.\n\n408\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.280\nWe don't have to worry about that,\neverything's encrypted.\n\n409\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.180\nIt's more safe to do it this\nway than it is your easy way.\n\n410\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.980\nI know it is harder for us to do it this\nway, but Is the more secure way to do it.\n\n411\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.160\nAnd, we've got to look at those types of\nthings and people just don't realize it.\n\n412\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.190\n>> Right.\n\n413\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.210\n>> Well, Brian you have definitely given\nus a lot to chew on when it comes to\n\n414\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:11.600\nthinking about how we need to manage\nour databases and prepare for auditing.\n\n415\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.270\nWhat we need to think about.\n\n416\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:18.580\nHow should we engage, working with\na database inside of our environment?\n\n417\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.510\nHow do we keep those things secure?\n\n418\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.950\nAnd, how do we keep the data out\nof the hands of the bad guys?\n\n419\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:23.970\nThat's always a good one.\n\n420\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.990\nThat's one thing we want to work on very,\nvery highly.\n\n421\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.780\nThat being said,\nwe thank you for dropping by.\n\n422\n00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.960\nWe thank our good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n423\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.390\nAnd remember, yet again, I like to plug\nthe book, at least twice because this is\n\n424\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.230\na good book and you're going to need\nit if you're trying to pass this exam.\n\n425\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:42.050\nIt is a bit of a bear, so make sure you\ngrab one of these copies right here.\n\n426\n00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.360\nCISA and grab it on Amazon or\nsomething like that.\n\n427\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.460\nThis is the fourth edition it just\nhit the shelves, so check that out.\n\n428\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.530\nThat being said, we thank you guys for\nwatching yet again.\n\n429\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.300\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n430\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.370\nFor ITPro TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n431\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.710\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n432\n00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.180\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n433\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.290\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.260\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe're continuing on with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.940\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that endeavor\n\n6\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.060\nis one of the authors of this here\nstudy guide that we've been using\n\n7\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.170\nto try to make it through the material,\nand doing a fine job of it as well.\n\n8\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.840\nThat man is none other than Mr.\nBrian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.760\nBrian, welcome back to the show,\nand how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.120\n>> Hi Daniel, it's going well, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.560\nIn this episode, today, this is\nthe concluding episode for domain four:\n\n12\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.060\nIT operations, management,\net cetera for the CISA exam.\n\n13\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.390\nIn this episode we are going to talk\na little bit about the auditor's\n\n14\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.470\nresponsibility for evaluating problem and\nincident management.\n\n15\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.110\nTo see if those problems are being\nhandled in an appropriate manner.\n\n16\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.600\nIn any size organization incidents are\ngoing to occur, and when I say 'incident,'\n\n17\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.400\nI don't necessarily mean catastrophic\nincidents or criminal incidents.\n\n18\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.160\nI just mean, things happen.\n\n19\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.910\nI think there's another term\nthat people sometimes use.\n\n20\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.127\n>> I call it 'Life.'\n>> That's a little different than that,\n\n21\n00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:21.150\nbut that happens.\n\n22\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.770\nBut things happen in an organization.\n\n23\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.040\nNow what's really important is\nnot that they be prevented, but\n\n24\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090\nthat they be handled\nproperly when they do occur.\n\n25\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.720\nThose events can be anything from\nminor disruptions in service to\n\n26\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.605\nmajor catastrophes.\n\n27\n00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:43.295\nOutages of internet, are probably one of\nthe most common, either carrier-based,\n\n28\n00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.725\nor maybe somebody goofed up\nsomething on a router, and\n\n29\n00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:50.235\nhit enter before thinking it\nthrough all the way etc, etc.\n\n30\n00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.825\nPatching a machine, and it had to update,\nor excuse me, reboot, but\n\n31\n00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:55.630\nyou didn't know that it had to reboot.\n\n32\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.180\nAgain what's important is\nthat you identify these and\n\n33\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.190\nthat they are handled properly.\n\n34\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.920\nI'm going to continue to hammer\nabout change management and\n\n35\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.520\nthe importance of that\nin the whole process.\n\n36\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.940\nIt will serve you well in terms\nof preventing most incidents.\n\n37\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.097\nEspecially if you follow your procedures\nand have adequate back-out or\n\n38\n00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:25.840\nback-out processors, and the ability to\nreverse whatever change it is you've made.\n\n39\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.250\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nthe steps in the problem and\n\n40\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.040\nincident management arena.\n\n41\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.030\nYou need to be able to,\nwhen you're doing your audit activities,\n\n42\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.660\nbe able to identify and have the people\nthat you're working with report to you\n\n43\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.510\nhow they identify those events.\n\n44\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.540\nHow are they actually classified,\n\n45\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.430\nare they tracked to their trouble ticket\nsystem, ticketing system, excuse me?\n\n46\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.880\nOr are they simply done\nmanually through a spreadsheet?\n\n47\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.060\nOr are they tracked at all?\n\n48\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.870\nPerhaps they're not tracked at all.\n\n49\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.890\nThat would be the worst case\nscenario in this instance.\n\n50\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.850\nBut how are they identified?\n\n51\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800\nAre there controls in place to\nadequately prevent them from happening?\n\n52\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.540\nSometimes, controls fail.\n\n53\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.700\nThat's part of the nature of controls.\n\n54\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.910\nBut are there in fact controls in\nplace to prevent them from failing?\n\n55\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.520\nWe talked in the previous episode about\nusing redundant hardware, such as routers,\n\n56\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.800\nso that if a router were to fail,\nmaybe a power supply failed on it.\n\n57\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.690\nOr, maybe somebody's working in\nthe telecommunications closet and\n\n58\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.010\nthey accidentally pop a power cable,\nthat could happen.\n\n59\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.385\nYou're working around a 100 or\n\n60\n00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:38.010\n1,000 cables sometimes, it's real easy\nto trip on something or get caught up.\n\n61\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.320\nThere are safety mechanisms even for\nthat in enterprise level routers.\n\n62\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.970\nTypically they actually have a little\nhook on the back of the power cord\n\n63\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.270\nthat will prevent you from unplugging\nit without first taking that clip off.\n\n64\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.940\nIt's designed for that exact experience.\n\n65\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.430\nIt's happened thousands\nof times over the years.\n\n66\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.010\nAnd so companies like Cisco,\netc have come up with ways to\n\n67\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.550\nput a control in place of your world\nto prevent that from happening.\n\n68\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.987\nSo, when I do my walk-through of\nthe telecommunications clause, for\n\n69\n00:04:07.987 --> 00:04:11.267\ninstance, I may look at things like,\nare the cables in good order?\n\n70\n00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:12.853\nAre they labeled properly?\n\n71\n00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:17.681\nAre there proper mechanisms in place on\nthe power cords to prevent them from being\n\n72\n00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:19.320\naccidentally unplugged?\n\n73\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.035\n>> Well you'll probably get to\nslap a lot of hands on that one?\n\n74\n00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:23.090\n[LAUGHTER]\n>> Well not really-\n\n75\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.410\n>> I've seen some bad cables\n\n76\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.120\n>> Yeah, most people in larger\n\n77\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.970\nenterprises have standards that they have\nto follow and they have bosses who will\n\n78\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.400\nslap their fingers, if you will,\nif they don't do a decent job.\n\n79\n00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.290\nBut yeah, in many smaller organizations\nwhere the staff either don't have\n\n80\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.800\nthe skill or they don't have\nthe time to mess with it, yeah,\n\n81\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.918\nyou can find some real mess,\nsome real bees mess.\n\n82\n00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:52.650\nSo anyway, so I wanna make sure\nthat there are adequate controls in\n\n83\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.778\nplace to prevent these kinds of\nincidents from occurring, but\n\n84\n00:04:55.778 --> 00:05:00.140\nthey still happen sometimes\nregardless of the best of intentions.\n\n85\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.509\nThen you want to take a look at how\nthe organization analyzes those events.\n\n86\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.690\nDo they do root cause analysis?\n\n87\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.770\nI've talked about that a number of\ntimes in the episodes, and while I harp\n\n88\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.540\non it pretty hard, it doesn't necessarily\nrelate to the way ISOCA looks at it.\n\n89\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.370\nI do it because I think it's\na good practice to learn.\n\n90\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.030\nRoot cause analysis in any\nenvironment is to really try and\n\n91\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.330\nget at the root of what caused\nthe problem to start with.\n\n92\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.980\nWas it because there weren't\nadequate controls in place?\n\n93\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.810\nWas it because there weren't\nadequate policies and procedures?\n\n94\n00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.430\nWas it because of training?\n\n95\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.660\nOr was it a composite of those?\n\n96\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.580\nAnd if so,\nwhat was the weighting of each of those?\n\n97\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.850\nSo for instance, you know, back to the\nexample of the power cord on the router\n\n98\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.510\nwithout the correct connector on the back\nof it can prevent it from being unplugged.\n\n99\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.441\nRegardless of all the training in\nthe world, if that control mechanism on\n\n100\n00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:00.260\nthe back of the router wasn't there, the\ncable is still going to get pulled out.\n\n101\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.890\nOk, it's going to happen eventually.\n\n102\n00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.450\nIt might even work its way loose without\nanyone even touching it, and you get\n\n103\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.290\na phone call at three in the morning\nthat one of your routers are offline.\n\n104\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.265\nThen you find out it was unplugged.\n\n105\n00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:15.270\n[LAUGH] This has nothing to do with data,\nbut recently my,\n\n106\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.320\nI'll tell a little side story.\n\n107\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.760\nMy wife had called me and said,\n\"Can you take a look at the dishwasher\n\n108\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.177\nat my mother in law's house because\nit seems to have stopped working?\n\n109\n00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:27.950\nAnd, you know, I do all the normal\ntroubleshooting things.\n\n110\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.740\nWell did you double check\nthe circuit breaker?\n\n111\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.190\nYes, circuit breaker is on, etc.\n\n112\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.240\nYou've flipped the switch and make sure\nyou didn't put your hand inside it, right?\n\n113\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.000\nYeah.\nDoes it seem like it will turn?\n\n114\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.550\nYeah.\nCouldn't figure it out.\n\n115\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.703\nWell I come to find out, I went over and\nlooked and the first thing I did was\n\n116\n00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:45.220\nopen up the cabinet where it was stored,\nand the cleaning lady had been down there\n\n117\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.200\nmoving things around, and she had\naccidentally knocked the power cord loose.\n\n118\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.480\nIt wasn't even unplugged,\nit had just come loose.\n\n119\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.830\nReached in, plugged it in, problem solved.\n\n120\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.510\n>> And that's the real danger.\n\n121\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.920\nIt's things like that where,\n\n122\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.480\nthose plugs can come loose enough to where\nthey look like they're still plugged in.\n\n123\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.380\nSo you do a cursory glance of.\n\n124\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.870\n>> That's right.\n>> Of your closet and you think, okay,\n\n125\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.400\neverything's good.\n\n126\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.940\nIt's plugged in.\n\n127\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.920\nYou're good to go.\n\n128\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.510\nBut why is this thing not working?\n\n129\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.640\nYou have to actually.\n\n130\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.580\nI tell people all the time, especially\non working a help desk, unplug it and\n\n131\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.370\nplug it back in.\n\n132\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.880\nVerify that it's seated well,\nfor those very reasons.\n\n133\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.130\n>> And\nthe other thing is to read the manual.\n\n134\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.820\nBecause there are generally instructions\nthat come with expensive devices.\n\n135\n00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.180\n>> You mean the thing that they threw\naway as soon as they open the box.\n\n136\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.080\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, they tell you how to install\n\n137\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.200\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n138\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.940\nNow, in larger environments, where many\nof the network devices run on 220,\n\n139\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.850\nyou have to do it because\nit's too dangerous not to.\n\n140\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.480\nSomeone could easily get killed.\n\n141\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.180\n110, unless you are standing in water,\nprobably just gonna knock you down.\n\n142\n00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.460\nBut 220 will flat kill you right on\nthe spot if you don't handle it properly.\n\n143\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.428\nAnyway.\n\n144\n00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:54.132\n>> So, Brian, now that we have\nall this information gathered,\n\n145\n00:07:54.132 --> 00:07:55.538\nwhat is it that we can do with it?\n\n146\n00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:57.618\nHow can we use it to our advantage?\n\n147\n00:07:57.618 --> 00:07:59.378\nThat's a good question, Daniel.\n\n148\n00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:03.090\nIt's important that we be able\nto gather the information, but\n\n149\n00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.400\nwhat's more important is,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n150\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.500\nWe need to be able to find some kind of\nreporting structure to be able to put\n\n151\n00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.210\nthis information into good use.\n\n152\n00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.740\nI've talked in many of the earlier\nsessions about root cause analysis, and\n\n153\n00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.441\nan important piece of root cause\nanalysis is data analytics.\n\n154\n00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:25.149\nSo, let's say for instance,\nwe have a physician office where,\n\n155\n00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:27.215\nthere seems to be a problem.\n\n156\n00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:32.184\nWith a particular, maybe a desk person,\nor a nursing assistant,\n\n157\n00:08:32.184 --> 00:08:34.460\nor something like that.\n\n158\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.692\nWhere they're continually making\nerrors with faxing medical\n\n159\n00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:41.017\ninformation to the wrong number.\n\n160\n00:08:41.017 --> 00:08:45.539\nOr maybe they're calling leaving voice\nmails on number that they can't verify or\n\n161\n00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:47.645\nvalidate can't belong to patients.\n\n162\n00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:51.160\nOr they're saying inappropriate things,\nthose would all be indicated,\n\n163\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.187\nthose would all be tracked as\nincidents that need to be handled.\n\n164\n00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:56.854\nBut if you can compile\nthat information and\n\n165\n00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:59.976\nput it into some type of\ndecent reporting format.\n\n166\n00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:04.312\nIt can help you identify the problem\nareas inside your office and\n\n167\n00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:07.180\noperations that need to be addressed.\n\n168\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.470\nAnd also help you try to identify\nwhat you should be doing about it.\n\n169\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.320\nMaybe you've got a bad process in place.\n\n170\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.940\nMaybe your training isn't effective.\n\n171\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.569\nMaybe you haven't\nexplained to employees what\n\n172\n00:09:17.569 --> 00:09:20.006\npersonally identifiable information is.\n\n173\n00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:23.424\nOr maybe you haven't really done\na good job explaining to them.\n\n174\n00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:27.527\nThe dangers of what might happen\nto one of their patients if\n\n175\n00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:31.140\nthat information were\ninappropriately exposed.\n\n176\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.440\nSo it helps you with your\nroot cause analysis and\n\n177\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.750\nwith your identification\nof remediation efforts.\n\n178\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.700\nIn addition all of this should be in line\nwith the IT organization's objectives and\n\n179\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.620\nstrategic plans.\n\n180\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.390\nWhich should also be, and we have\nmentioned this in previous episodes,\n\n181\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.670\nin line with the business goals and\nstrategic objectives.\n\n182\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.910\nA healthcare organization\nagain going back to that.\n\n183\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.100\nPart of their goal and strategy should be\nnot only providing excellent care, but\n\n184\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.650\nalso protecting the privacy\nof their individual patients.\n\n185\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.846\nI think you'll find in most\nhealthcare facilities,\n\n186\n00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:18.830\nit's required in baking that they post\na privacy notice on their websites.\n\n187\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:24.014\nJust for these kinds of things so\nthat when a banking customer for instance,\n\n188\n00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:28.388\nmight be contacted because\nsomething accidentally happened.\n\n189\n00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:32.481\nThat they understand that those kinds of\nthings are being addressed appropriately\n\n190\n00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:33.618\nat the institution.\n\n191\n00:10:33.618 --> 00:10:38.570\nSo, you want to take a very hard look\n\n192\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.430\nat how incidents are handled\ninside your organization.\n\n193\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.380\nIs there a clear incident policy?\n\n194\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.460\nAre there processes in place?\n\n195\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.310\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n196\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.370\nwhat we really want to find out is,\nhave the problems been resolved?\n\n197\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.811\nNot only adequately, but\nhave they lead to better performance?\n\n198\n00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:02.806\nSo, we can talk all day about how staff\nare faxing things to wrong numbers,\n\n199\n00:11:02.806 --> 00:11:07.342\nor they're leaving messages with\npatients that they shouldn't.\n\n200\n00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:13.266\nOr perhaps, the bank has mailed your\nstatement to the wrong address.\n\n201\n00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:18.097\nHas the investigation of those incidents,\nthe recording of those incidents,\n\n202\n00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:22.436\nthe data analytics and root cause\nanalysis led to better performance?\n\n203\n00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:25.208\nBecause if it hasn't then it is\nall kind of a waste of time,\n\n204\n00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:27.170\nit is just an exercise.\n\n205\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.610\nSo oftentimes auditors\nare faced with that.\n\n206\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.760\nFolks think that what we are doing is just\na matter of forcing them to go through\n\n207\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.590\nexercises.\n\n208\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.390\nBecause we think it's in their\nbest interest for some reason.\n\n209\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.810\nAnd what it really boils down to, it's in\nthe best interest of the organization,\n\n210\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.986\nit's in the best interest of their\nclients, customers, patients, etc.\n\n211\n00:11:47.986 --> 00:11:53.070\nLast thing I wanna talk about,\nwe've still got 5 or10 minutes\n\n212\n00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.860\nleft in the episode here, is I want to\ntalk a little bit about disaster recovery.\n\n213\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:03.810\nBusiness continuity, and\nwhat we call DR drills, or BCP drills.\n\n214\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.171\nThere's a number of different types\nof these that I wanna talk about.\n\n215\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.601\nIn particular, when we're\ntalking about disaster recovery,\n\n216\n00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:15.955\nwe're talking about what happens when,\n\n217\n00:12:15.955 --> 00:12:20.342\nI think in one of the previous episodes\nI talked about a customer of mine once.\n\n218\n00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:24.209\nWho had a lightning strike in the middle\nof the summer that hit between\n\n219\n00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:27.091\nthe transformer and\ntheir battery backup system.\n\n220\n00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:30.456\nFried their complete battery system, and\n\n221\n00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:34.790\ndamaged a lot of equipment\nin their environment.\n\n222\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:40.300\nSomething they couldn't, you literally\ncan't put a control in place for that.\n\n223\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.060\nThe chances of a lightning strike\nhappening between the pole with\n\n224\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.030\nthe transformer on it and\n\n225\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.010\nyour building are pretty small and\nthere's nothing you can do about it.\n\n226\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.187\nIf it happens, it happens,\nyou've got battery backups,\n\n227\n00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.969\nthey're designed to get fried.\n\n228\n00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:57.746\nBut sometimes the nature of lightning\nis so powerful, it can, believe it or\n\n229\n00:12:57.746 --> 00:13:01.790\nnot, it can actually trip through\nthe battery backup systems.\n\n230\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.918\nFaster than the batteries can stop\nthem and actually damage equipment.\n\n231\n00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:12.680\nSo we wanna talk about disaster recovery\ndrills or I call them what if scenarios.\n\n232\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.910\nIn banking we talk a lot about in terms\nof what we call table top exercises.\n\n233\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.430\nAnd in healthcare for\nthose of you on the web watching us\n\n234\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.010\nwho might work in healthcare environments,\nthis is called contingency planning.\n\n235\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:35.750\nSo the same exact thing, disaster recovery\ncontingency planning tomato, tomato.\n\n236\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.909\nDisaster recovery drill is something\nthat I encourage organizations and\n\n237\n00:13:39.909 --> 00:13:42.060\nyou should as an auditor be checking.\n\n238\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.360\nTo see whether organizations are doing\nthis, at a bare minimum, once a year.\n\n239\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.730\nHopefully, as\nthe organization gets larger,\n\n240\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.830\nmaybe even once a quarter or twice a year.\n\n241\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.920\nAnd the reason is because,\ndisasters happen.\n\n242\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.012\nTornadoes hit, floods happen,\npower outages,\n\n243\n00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:03.881\nall kinds of crazy stuff that, from day\nto day, we don't really think about.\n\n244\n00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:07.233\nDepending on the part of\nthe country that you live in,\n\n245\n00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:11.866\nyou live in the very midwest you go\nfrom Texas straight up to North Dakota.\n\n246\n00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:14.713\nThat is tornado alley,\nyou are gonna have tornadoes guaranteed.\n\n247\n00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:22.289\nSo you had better be prepared for that and\nbe able to have some controls in place.\n\n248\n00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:26.770\nTo offer your organization some\nresiliency against those kind of events.\n\n249\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.410\nCuz they're going to happen, and\nif you pretend that they're not,\n\n250\n00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.400\nyou're only fooling yourself and\ngonna get in trouble.\n\n251\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.220\nOne of the interesting things about\nIndiana is it actually happens to be\n\n252\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.700\none of the best places in the country,\nIndiana's where I'm from by the way.\n\n253\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.410\nIt happens to be one of the best places in\nthe country for data center operations.\n\n254\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.740\nBecause it has a such a low rate,\nwe have tornadoes very,\n\n255\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.500\nvery infrequently, and\nthey're generally not very damaging.\n\n256\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.140\nNowhere near like what you typically\nsee coming up through Texas and\n\n257\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.910\nOklahoma and Kansas.\n\n258\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.090\nBut we still do tornado drills.\n\n259\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:06.860\nNow here's another great example\nof where a drill can help.\n\n260\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:13.030\nI worked with a manufacturing company\ndecades ago where a tornado came through.\n\n261\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.820\nIt didn't destroy the company, it didn't\ndestroy the town, but you know what?\n\n262\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.450\nIt peeled back the roof of the aluminum\nmanufacturing building they were in.\n\n263\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.980\nAnd they got eight inches of rain dropped\nin their server room and every one of\n\n264\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.650\ntheir server hard drives fried because-\n>> The servers were dry.\n\n265\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> In less than 10 minutes,\n\n266\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.750\nthey were pummeled with hail, and\n\n267\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.480\nhad eight inches of rain,\neight inches of water in the room.\n\n268\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.110\n>> So they were done at that point, I mean\nthat's just dead servers at that point.\n\n269\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.820\n>> Completely shut the company down, yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.590\nThey were, fortunately they did have\nbackups but it took them weeks to recover.\n\n271\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.018\nFire is another one.\n\n272\n00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:53.946\nVery few businesses actually\never recover from a fire.\n\n273\n00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:56.071\nSo you wanna be able to prevent that or\n\n274\n00:15:56.071 --> 00:16:00.538\nstop it very quickly should it ever\nShould ever happen in your organization.\n\n275\n00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:01.194\nIn your book,\n\n276\n00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:05.150\nthere's some references to the different\nkinds of fire suppression systems.\n\n277\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.890\nYou should be familiar with those.\n\n278\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.900\nGas versus water.\n\n279\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.290\nIn water,\nthere's wet pipe versus dry pipe, etc.\n\n280\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.870\nBe familiar with those terms for the exam.\n\n281\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.630\nI should be able to spot\nthose pretty quickly.\n\n282\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.870\nA dry pipe versus wet pipe's not too\nhard to distinguish between the two.\n\n283\n00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.960\n>> Are we using Halon anymore?\n\n284\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.980\n>> No, we're not using Halon anymore.\n\n285\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.330\n>> Halon's been illegalized, right.\n\n286\n00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.940\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.610\nBut the point I'm trying to make is that\nany organization should be practicing\n\n288\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:38.200\ngood DR Tabletop exercises on\nsomewhat of a regular basis.\n\n289\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.090\nAnd those exercises can be what if this,\nwhat if that.\n\n290\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.110\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n291\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.460\nWhat's more important is that\nthe organization practice\n\n292\n00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.590\nwhat happens in an emergency.\n\n293\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.330\nWho gets called first?\n\n294\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.540\nWhat do we take down first?\n\n295\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.790\nBanks, you've listened to me throughout\nthis series talk about my background\n\n296\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.790\nexperience in banking.\n\n297\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.500\nIn bank robbery situations,\nbank personnel,\n\n298\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.750\nthat's the very first training you\ngo through as a new hire in a bank,\n\n299\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.590\nis what to do during a robbery,\nespecially if you're a teller.\n\n300\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.770\nThere are very specific steps\nthat you get trained on.\n\n301\n00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.120\nAnd even after training over\ntraining over training on it,\n\n302\n00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.060\nit still can't prepare you for\nit when it happens.\n\n303\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.370\nIt can be really devastating event for\nsomeone especially if you're,\n\n304\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:27.350\nif there's guns involved,\nit can be a really traumatic event.\n\n305\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.940\nSo there really isn't really kind\nof preparation you can do for,\n\n306\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.530\nany more than there is a tornado.\n\n307\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.720\nWhen a tornado comes through, the CEO\nmay be worrying about the company but\n\n308\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.820\nyou're going to be worrying\nabout your family.\n\n309\n00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.720\nAnd that's exactly what you should be.\n\n310\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.470\nPhysical security of your personnel and\nthe people you live with and\n\n311\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.750\nwork with should be your\nfirst priority always.\n\n312\n00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.700\nData can be replaced, people can't.\n\n313\n00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.015\n>> Brian, when we do a drill or\na what if scenario,\n\n314\n00:17:52.015 --> 00:17:55.305\nI guess specifically in the drills,\nare we flipping switches?\n\n315\n00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:59.955\nAre we saying, okay, Ive got a redundant\nline in case a tornado comes through and\n\n316\n00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.185\nwipes out this building.\n\n317\n00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:05.210\nOr I've got replication happening\nto a DR site and I want to know,\n\n318\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.450\nwill it fail over to that site and\nwill it do it correctly.\n\n319\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.080\nAm I cutting the power off of my actual\ndevices and letting that happen?\n\n320\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.860\n>> No, good question.\n\n321\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.470\nNo you're not.\n\n322\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:20.050\nThat's the whole purpose of doing it, it's\nwhy it's a drill is that it's designed to\n\n323\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:25.390\npractice what would happen in the event\nof an incident like that so that you\n\n324\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:30.360\ndon't run the risk of actually damaging\ndata or taking the company offline, etc.\n\n325\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.100\nIn banks for instance,\nwhen we do penetration testing or\n\n326\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.550\nvulnerability scanning we have\nvery clear engagement rules\n\n327\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.320\nabout stopping any activity should\nit begin to take a system offline.\n\n328\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.600\nBecause those are critical resources.\n\n329\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.280\nWhen we're working in hospital\nenvironments, for instance, and\n\n330\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.490\nwe're doing pen testing,\nwireless testing, etc., we have\n\n331\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:58.060\nto be very careful not to disrupt services\nbecause it could hurt someone actually.\n\n332\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.240\nIt could cause medicine\nto not be available.\n\n333\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.240\nIt could cause oxygen supplies to fail,\nthings like that.\n\n334\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.040\nSo we are very strict,\nvery specific Rules of Engagement.\n\n335\n00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.715\nBut what's really important and\n\n336\n00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:14.720\nwhat I'm trying to stress is that if\nyou practice these as if they happened,\n\n337\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.920\nthen when they do you'll have a little\nbit better game plan in place.\n\n338\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.570\nWho to call, who is responsible for\nwhat activities, and\n\n339\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.230\nwhat you should be doing so you're not\nrunning around like a chicken with your\n\n340\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.750\nhead cut off when it happens\ncause it will eventually.\n\n341\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.870\n>> Yeah it's definitely gonna occur and\nthis is why we do\n\n342\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:39.000\nlike you said these types of drills\nbecause in a crisis scenario we tend to,\n\n343\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.330\nlike you said, the decapitated poultry\nsyndrome sets in very very quickly,\n\n344\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.670\nand we tend to default to at,\nleast in my experience,\n\n345\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.220\nwe tend to default to our highest\nlevel of mastered training.\n\n346\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.290\nAnd if we haven't been trained, not the\nstuff that yeah we walked through a drill\n\n347\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.980\none time, but\nwe've constantly been working on this and\n\n348\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.990\nI know that if this happens,\nI'm going into second nature mode,\n\n349\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.805\nI don't have to worry about thinking\nabout it, I'm just gonna react.\n\n350\n00:20:03.805 --> 00:20:04.420\n>> Right.\n\n351\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.890\n>> And that's kinda where we wanna get in\nthese types of scenarios so that you can\n\n352\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.410\njust okay react, I know exactly what\nto do, I've done this a million times.\n\n353\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.200\nI don't have to think about\nit I can just do it right?\n\n354\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.760\n>> Right.\n\n355\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.190\nAnd we can do actual drills as well and\nif the organization you're auditing or\n\n356\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.660\nworking with is doing that\nI think that's even better.\n\n357\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.450\nThat takes a lot more resources.\n\n358\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.290\n>> There's gonna be tests sites and\nthings of that nature.\n\n359\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.885\n>> Yeah, and you wanna be very\nspecific when you engage to do it so\n\n360\n00:20:27.885 --> 00:20:32.174\nthat you know that if you do take this\ndown that there are the resources that\n\n361\n00:20:32.174 --> 00:20:36.391\nfolks can use to get to the things that\nthey need to because you don't want\n\n362\n00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:38.420\nto interrupt critical services.\n\n363\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.160\nSo hospitals do this all of the time.\n\n364\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.480\nThey do dry runs, if you will or\nmock disasters were they\n\n365\n00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.740\npaint people with red food dye and\nlay them down in the street.\n\n366\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.660\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n367\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.450\nThat's still a drill, because\nyou're not actually hurting anyone.\n\n368\n00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:58.920\nBut it's good exercise,\nthat's why the National Guard does them,\n\n369\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.120\nthat's why the State Police do\nthese kind of drills all the time.\n\n370\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.690\nThat's why the military does it,\nmilitary drills and drills and drills and\n\n371\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.190\ndrills, that's why in the Marine Corp,\n\n372\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:13.260\nthe big guy who hits you on the head\nis called a Drill Sergeant so\n\n373\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.240\nthat you know what to do because when\nyou're getting a gun shot at you from\n\n374\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.523\nthe other side of the the field you gotta\nknow what to do or you're gonna get hurt.\n\n375\n00:21:22.523 --> 00:21:23.968\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> About the fight or flight response.\n\n376\n00:21:23.968 --> 00:21:25.616\n[CROSSTALK] Bullets are whizzing by.\n\n377\n00:21:25.616 --> 00:21:26.836\nSo it's good stuff.\n\n378\n00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:28.356\nIs there anything else we need\nto know about [CROSSTALK]\n\n379\n00:21:28.356 --> 00:21:29.934\n>> No, that's it for today,\n\n380\n00:21:29.934 --> 00:21:34.460\nthis is the wrap up on Domain Four, we're\ngoing to start Domain Five in our next\n\n381\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.580\nepisode and then tomorrow were gonna\nhave a couple special episodes.\n\n382\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.220\nSo hopefully you all will be\nable to stick around for that.\n\n383\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.890\nAnd then, in our last episode today,\nwe'll get into Domain Five.\n\n384\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:47.570\n>> Well, that'll be fun.\n\n385\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.310\nWe thank you so much for dropping by,\nhelping us understand what we need to do\n\n386\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.400\nin case an incident actually does occur\nand how we need to handle the situations\n\n387\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.780\nso that, when we're auditing these things,\nwe can find our weak spots and fix them.\n\n388\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.090\nThat being said, looks like we've come\nto the end of yet another episode.\n\n389\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.200\nI do wanna remind you guys to pick\nup a copy of the study guide.\n\n390\n00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.470\nRemember, it's the fourth edition.\n\n391\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.740\nNot the third, the second, or the first.\n\n392\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.260\nThe fourth is what you wanna grab.\n\n393\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.750\nWe thank Mr. Bryan O here for\njoining us today.\n\n394\n00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.922\nWe thank you guys for watching,\nI guess we'll sign off for ITProTV,\n\n395\n00:22:16.922 --> 00:22:19.671\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie And\nI'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n396\n00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:22.185\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n397\n00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:29.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.463\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:22.041\nwe are continuing on\nwith our series on CISA.\n\n5\n00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.940\nThat's the Certified\nInformation Systems Auditor.\n\n6\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.570\nI wanna say author every time because\nI have one of the authors of the study\n\n7\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.500\nguide that we've been using right here,\nthe new 4th edition available from Wiley,\n\n8\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.890\nis our good friend and\nmentor in this endeavor, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n9\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.910\nBrian, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.140\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.050\n>> Good, thanks Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.060\nThanks for having me back again.\n\n13\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.690\nWell, folks, so here we are kicking\noff Domain 5 at the end of our\n\n14\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.150\nseries on the CISA exam prep,\nProtecting IT Assets.\n\n15\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.700\nNow this is 25% of the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.550\nSo it's, I think rightfully so\na very large chunk of the material.\n\n17\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.490\nSo we'll be doing, we'll be closing up\ntoday's efforts, kicking off domain five,\n\n18\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.730\nbut we'll be doing a lot\nmore information tomorrow.\n\n19\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.630\nI'm going to be doing a couple of deep\ndives in both the what we call PKI or\n\n20\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.250\nPublic Key Infrastructure.\n\n21\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.047\nThere's a specific episode I want to\ndo to explain how encryptions and\n\n22\n00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:29.900\ndigital signatures work.\n\n23\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.510\nAnd then secondly, we're gonna be doing\na little deeper dive into what we call\n\n24\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.390\nthe Open Systems Interconnection Model,\nwhich is outlined in the book.\n\n25\n00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.410\nThere's plenty of information there in\nthe chapters for you to review back.\n\n26\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.150\nBut I wanna make sure you\nunderstand it going into the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.610\nAnd I wanna make sure you understand both\nof those, because they're very important.\n\n28\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.670\nVery important concepts to get down and\noftentimes auditors studying for\n\n29\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.552\nthe CIS exam who don't have\nan extensive background in security or\n\n30\n00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.840\nnetworking cant get bogged\ndown in the details of that.\n\n31\n00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.650\nSo it's important not that you just be\nable to identify the information and\n\n32\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.760\nanswer it for the questions on the exam.\n\n33\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.330\nBut it's really important for\nyou to understand it from a functional\n\n34\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.790\nperspective, or practical,\nor pragmatic perspective, so\n\n35\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.720\nthat you understand what we're talking\nabout when you get into encryption\n\n36\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.688\nand other areas of IT in the real world.\n\n37\n00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:30.440\nSo we're gonna kick this off with, the\npurpose of domain five is to ensure that\n\n38\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.410\nthe CISA candidate understands how\nto protect information assets.\n\n39\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.780\nWe'll talk about the evaluation\nof the design implementation and\n\n40\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.840\nmonitoring of controls.\n\n41\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.088\nWe'll try to get through all those.\n\n42\n00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:47.596\nAnd when we talk about the design and\n\n43\n00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:53.283\nimplementation we're really talking about\ncontrols around what I will call and\n\n44\n00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:57.230\nwhat is called typically in\nthe business the CIA triad.\n\n45\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.940\nThe CIA triad consists of Confidentiality.\n\n46\n00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.710\nConfidentiality means\nensuring that only those\n\n47\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.670\nauthorized to see data\ncan actually access it.\n\n48\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.980\nSo, confidentiality might\nbe like your postman,\n\n49\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.930\nwho ensures that the letters designed and\n\n50\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.080\nintended for delivery to you are in sealed\nenvelopes that have not been opened.\n\n51\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.710\nWe'll talk about integrity and\navailabilities next, but so\n\n52\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.910\nthink of your postman ensures\nthat when those envelopes\n\n53\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.890\nthat have been sealed by the person\nsending you the information, that they\n\n54\n00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.200\nmaintain their sealed state and that when\nthey deliver them they`re still sealed.\n\n55\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.060\nSo only you can access that information,\nwe`ll talk a little bit about privacy and\n\n56\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.120\nhow sometimes private people get privacy,\nand security,\n\n57\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.150\nsort of mixed up, we`ll try and\nbreak that up a little bit and\n\n58\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.550\nmaking sure we`ll also talk a little\nbit about privacy standards.\n\n59\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.990\nLet's go back to the CIA triad for\na minute.\n\n60\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.030\nSo we talk about confidentiality.\n\n61\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.440\nThat's ensuring that only the authorized\nuser sees the information or\n\n62\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.530\ncan access the information\nthat's designed for them to see.\n\n63\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.860\nThat's what confidentiality is about.\n\n64\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.260\nIntegrity is about ensuring that the data\nhas not been tampered with in transit.\n\n65\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.490\nWhether that be between the webpage and\nthe database on the backend where that's\n\n66\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.310\nbeing written, whether that information is\nbetween the email that I send to Daniel or\n\n67\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.540\nhe sends to me.\n\n68\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.420\nWe want to make sure that the data\narrives at the authorized user\n\n69\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.769\nin the same state it was sent and\nthat it was at when it was sent.\n\n70\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.350\nMaybe there's been some additions to it,\nbut that the original message or\n\n71\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.710\nthe original data hasn't been in any way\ncompromised, changed, etc, or hacked.\n\n72\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.060\nOne of the things we talk\nabout in the world of\n\n73\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.914\nsecurity is what we call\na man in the middle attack.\n\n74\n00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:07.690\nA man in the middle attack\nis where we might, for\n\n75\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.790\ninstance, compromise\nan SSL certificate and\n\n76\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.830\nfool you into believing that\nyou're on a site that's been.\n\n77\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.269\nThat looks like the site that you\nintended to go to but is actually phony.\n\n78\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.610\nSo the integrity of the site\nhas been compromised.\n\n79\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.880\nYou're not actually looking at real data,\nyou're looking at phony data.\n\n80\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.710\nAnd so you might see a field, for\ninstance, that has been tampered with.\n\n81\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.250\nSo that when you put your data in, instead\nof it going to the place it's intended to\n\n82\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.440\ngo somewhere else into a hacker's hands.\n\n83\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.470\nAnd, next thing you know,\nyou've got some identity theft going on.\n\n84\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.870\nThe third piece of that triad, the CIA\ntriad, the A stands for availability.\n\n85\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.770\nNow, typically when we think of\navailability, we think well,\n\n86\n00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.960\nthe web server being available.\n\n87\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.970\nBut it also can mean database\ninformation being available.\n\n88\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.290\nSo if I'm an internal user and\nI'm, for instance, querying\n\n89\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:19.380\nan accounting information database for\npayroll information, that information,\n\n90\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.570\nif it's not available to me,\nif I can't get into it I can't do my job.\n\n91\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.210\nOkay, so the systems begins to crash.\n\n92\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.060\nIf I can't do my job,\nnow I have to stop and wait for\n\n93\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:37.400\nthat system to become available, for\nwhatever reason I can't complete my tasks.\n\n94\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.170\nAnd that may mean that other\npeople can't complete their tasks.\n\n95\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.990\nOr if that data is not available now,\nI can't populate a report.\n\n96\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.080\nSo, there are repercussions downstream.\n\n97\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.750\nSo, again, you see the connection\nbetween the CIA parts.\n\n98\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.640\nThe data has to be only\naccessible authorized\n\n99\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.290\nto access it, it has to be correct and\ncomplete, that's integrity.\n\n100\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.240\nAnd it has be available to us.\n\n101\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.470\nIf any of those three pieces\nis not functioning properly,\n\n102\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.270\nwe have a breach of some kind.\n\n103\n00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:19.100\nAll right, so it's important for\nyou to understand those three functions or\n\n104\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.048\nthe three legs of what\nwe call the CIA triad.\n\n105\n00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:27.900\nNow, we talked a little bit about privacy\nbecause we often times get excuse me.\n\n106\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.110\nPrivacy and\nsecurity are mixed up a little bit.\n\n107\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.480\nIn privacy, we wanna talk about,\nin particular,\n\n108\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.660\nlaws and regulations with regard\nto privacy for the CISA exam.\n\n109\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.613\nAgain, mentioned this a number of times,\nISACA being an international organization.\n\n110\n00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:56.324\nYou will see references to what we call\nthe EU or the European Union Privacy rules\n\n111\n00:07:56.324 --> 00:07:59.790\nwhich are very different than\nthose in the United States.\n\n112\n00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.020\nThose have recently changed.\n\n113\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.944\nAnd you don't have to know\nthe specifics of the EU privacy rules.\n\n114\n00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:07.610\nAnd again, you couldn't.\n\n115\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.310\nThere's no way that could update the exam\nto reflect those in time for the exam.\n\n116\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.870\nNor would you be able to\nunderstand them at this point\n\n117\n00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.510\ncuz they're still being sorted out.\n\n118\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.870\nBut you will have to be familiar with\nthe fact that there are EU privacy rules\n\n119\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.930\nthat are different than\nthose in the United States.\n\n120\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.110\nIn the EU for instance the assumption for\n\n121\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.210\ninstance is the data owner or\nme for instance.\n\n122\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:40.070\nI own my data, the fact I was\nborn in 1953 in May, on the 15th.\n\n123\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.490\nThat's my data and I own it and-\n>> So you're talking about your PII.\n\n124\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.660\n>> Exactly, my personally identifiable\ninformation belongs to me,\n\n125\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.700\nnot the person at the other\nend of the pipe, if you will,\n\n126\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.540\nwhether that be a web application or\nwhatever.\n\n127\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.500\n>> And that's even if I, as a third party,\nmaybe I just heard of you.\n\n128\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.300\nI create a database with that data\nin it that you are Brian O'Hara,\n\n129\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.020\nyou are born on such and\nsuch a date, you're such and\n\n130\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.810\nsuch tall, that is all your data and\nyou have some sort of say so over that.\n\n131\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.260\n>> Yeah, actually, in the EU you're not\nallowed to create that database until I\n\n132\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.190\ngive you permission to do so.\n\n133\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.450\nThat data's owned by me.\n\n134\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.420\nAnd in fact they've even gone to\nthe extent recently in the EU where\n\n135\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.640\nthey now have a data destruction law,\nwhere if I'm a minor and\n\n136\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.660\nI turn 18 I can actually require you,\nI can request it, but I can require you to\n\n137\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.110\ndestroy all the records that may have been\ncreated about me prior to my turning 18.\n\n138\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:40.306\nNow that's a huge shift in privacy laws,\nand we're still seeing whether or\n\n139\n00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:44.216\nnot that's actually going\nto be enforceable, etc etc.\n\n140\n00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.456\nBut we'll just see as\ntime goes on with that.\n\n141\n00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:51.200\nBut the point is that there\nare privacy rules in place outside\n\n142\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.810\nthe United States that can\nhave a great impact on us.\n\n143\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.140\nI worked with a manufacturing\ncompany a few years ago\n\n144\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.240\nwith operations into Ireland.\n\n145\n00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.960\nAnd one of the things the do is that they\nprovide benefits, healthcare benefits, for\n\n146\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.510\ntheir employees, and they actually\nmanage the healthcare benefits inside\n\n147\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.770\nthe United States purely because they\ndon't wanna have to deal with EU rules.\n\n148\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.930\nIreland's part of the EU.\n\n149\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.460\nAnd the EU privacy rules say\nthat healthcare records and\n\n150\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.650\nemployee records have to be\nhandled very differently.\n\n151\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.036\nSo, the records are actually\nstored in the United States,\n\n152\n00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:27.108\neven though they're Irish residents and\n\n153\n00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:32.652\nthey pay Irish taxes their health care\nbenefit are doled out inside the US.\n\n154\n00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:36.655\nNow there may be some scrambling around\nthat the next few years in terms of well\n\n155\n00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:40.363\nit doesn't matter where your benefits\nare being handles or doled out.\n\n156\n00:10:40.363 --> 00:10:46.160\nYou're an Irish citizen and therefore\nthose rules may apply to you there.\n\n157\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.900\nSo, it'll be interesting\nto see how that plays out.\n\n158\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.380\n>> I was about to say\nthe exact same thing.\n\n159\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.030\nIt'll be interesting to see how\nthey're going to enforce that because\n\n160\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.660\nif everything is happening in the United\nStates through some third party, and\n\n161\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.260\nthen being sent back to Ireland as say\na check or a payment of some sort.\n\n162\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.550\nI don't know how they're going to know\nthat other than go through their mail and\n\n163\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.530\nsee these things.\n\n164\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.240\n>> Right, yeah, so it'll be interesting\nto see how that plays out over time.\n\n165\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.279\nBut the point is for the purposes\nof the exam it's important for\n\n166\n00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:16.157\nyou to understand that there\nare different privacy rules.\n\n167\n00:11:16.157 --> 00:11:20.028\nOne particular regulation that I would\nlike to point out is the HIPAA law,\n\n168\n00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:22.151\nthe Health Information Portability and\n\n169\n00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:24.973\nAffordability Act that we\nmention a number of times.\n\n170\n00:11:24.973 --> 00:11:29.160\nThere is both a privacy rule and\na security rule.\n\n171\n00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.710\nThey are very different and very separate.\n\n172\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.690\nThe privacy rule lays out all the ground\nrule and regulations around If and\n\n173\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.630\nwhen and how information about you can and\nmust be disclosed.\n\n174\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.610\nSo, for instance, if I go to physician and\nI say I refuse to allow\n\n175\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.180\nyou to share this information with drug\ncompanies or even my insurance company\n\n176\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.180\nnow I'm sure if I refuse to share it my\ninsurance may choose to not pay the bill.\n\n177\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.610\nBut I have the right to do that and\nit's important.\n\n178\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.600\nAmericans often times\ndon't understand that,\n\n179\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.270\nthat they do have\ncontractual requirements.\n\n180\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.280\nNow that may require them to\nrelease that information.\n\n181\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.230\nThe other thing that's different\nabout the US is that in the US and\n\n182\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.980\nthis has been carried out in or\nborn out in case law.\n\n183\n00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.770\nI don't have the citations for you but\nin the US, healthcare data for instance,\n\n184\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:26.010\nonce I go see my physician and I file an\ninsurance claim and I've signed my papers.\n\n185\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.220\nThat data belongs to\nthe healthcare provider.\n\n186\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.490\nIt no longer belongs to me.\n\n187\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.990\nThat's a complete 180 from the EU, and\nyou very well may see that challenged in\n\n188\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.690\nthe next decade in the U.S., and laws and\nrules may change about that, because our\n\n189\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.670\nopinions about that are shifting, and\nmay very well change in the future.\n\n190\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.010\nSo, that's the first part\nof the first piece of,\n\n191\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.690\nDomain Five in the session.\n\n192\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.270\nThe next piece I wanna talk about are,\n\n193\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.980\nwe're gonna start at the very bottom,\nand start talking about physical\n\n194\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.360\ncontrols before we get into logical\naccess controls and stuff like that.\n\n195\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.229\nAgain, we're talking about\nhow do we protect IT assets.\n\n196\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.070\nThe first layer is the way I look at it.\n\n197\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.080\nAnd we'll see why when we talk\ntomorrow when we talk about the open\n\n198\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.780\nsystem interconnection model.\n\n199\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.200\nThe first layer being physical.\n\n200\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.850\nYou will need to be familiar with and\nbe able to identify and\n\n201\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:31.770\nanswer questions about such things as\nfire prevention and suppression systems.\n\n202\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.560\nParticular in the book, there's\na number of references to things like,\n\n203\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.860\nwe mentioned in the last episode\nabout wet and dry pipe systems.\n\n204\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.030\nYou'll need to know about that.\n\n205\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.300\nFire suppression systems, wet pipe being\n\n206\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.520\npipes that run in the overhead ceiling\nthat actually have water in them.\n\n207\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.140\nAnd so if one of those pipes\nwere to freeze or break or\n\n208\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.950\nsomething like that could\ndamage equipment underneath it.\n\n209\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.080\nDry pipe systems, which are what\nyou see in newer buildings today,\n\n210\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.120\nare systems where where, and\nthey're, to be more specific,\n\n211\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.630\nthey're also zone dry pipe system.\n\n212\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.520\nSo that there's no water\nin the pipes at all.\n\n213\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.580\nSo that if something were to happen, if\nthe building were to, a ceiling crash or\n\n214\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.880\nsomething, nothing's gonna be\nreleased into the environment.\n\n215\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.410\nBut in addition to that, if there is\na fire that trips the dry pipe system,\n\n216\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.820\nIt then opens the valve and\nallows water to be released.\n\n217\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.840\nIt only does it in the zone where\nit detects the fire or heat or\n\n218\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.920\nwhatever it is that's\nsending off the sensor.\n\n219\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.165\nSo it doesn't destroy an entire building\njust because one person lights a match, or\n\n220\n00:14:39.165 --> 00:14:44.165\na teenager gets into a room plays\na prank and sets off, takes a match and\n\n221\n00:14:44.165 --> 00:14:46.035\nholds it up to one of the sprinkler heads.\n\n222\n00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:49.785\nOnly that sprinkler head will\ngo off because the rest won't.\n\n223\n00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:54.275\nEven though water will come down the pipe,\nthe rest of the sensors won't come off.\n\n224\n00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:58.165\n>> Yeah it's a really interesting thing,\nI never realized that about the dry and\n\n225\n00:14:58.165 --> 00:14:59.180\nwet pipes, that.\n\n226\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.280\nAnd it makes sense if I've got\na pipe over a server room,\n\n227\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.340\nI don't want it to be filled with water.\n\n228\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.830\nSo in case something does come through\nthe ceiling, drops through, and\n\n229\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.670\nhits the pipe, I'm not soaking my servers.\n\n230\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.430\n>> Or even a telecommunications closet,\nthat's where they're most\n\n231\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.730\noften overlooked,\nis when they they go through there, and\n\n232\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.740\nthey could easily blow out a critical\nswitch, or a critical router.\n\n233\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.560\n>> Easily yeah, no doubt about that.\n\n234\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.810\nNow Bryan, is there any other areas,\nwhen it comes to fire suppression,\n\n235\n00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.290\nthat an auditor might need to know about,\nor take a look at?\n\n236\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.450\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n237\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.580\nThat's a good question.\n\n238\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.560\nOne of the things that I oftentimes do,\nwhen I do my physical sweep\n\n239\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.850\nthrough on an audit is I ask to look\ninside the telecommunications closets, and\n\n240\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.720\nor the server rooms.\n\n241\n00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.020\nThe data center whatever\nthey happen to have.\n\n242\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.650\nAnd I look for oversights like that.\n\n243\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.590\nI constantly look for\nloose power connections.\n\n244\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.860\nThe kinds of things that\npeople overlook often times.\n\n245\n00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.347\nI've been doing this enough years\nthat I've seen not everything, but\n\n246\n00:15:54.347 --> 00:15:56.913\nI've seen a lot of mistakes\nhappen because of that.\n\n247\n00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.755\nAnd often times they'll put\nswitches in a closet, for instance,\n\n248\n00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:03.031\nwhere there's a sprinkler overhead.\n\n249\n00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:05.393\nAnd they'll say, well we didn't\nhave any place else to put them.\n\n250\n00:16:05.393 --> 00:16:08.007\nWell that's okay but you need to\nunderstand if that sprinkler ever goes off\n\n251\n00:16:08.007 --> 00:16:10.930\nyou're going to lose some equipment\nit's going to cost you some money.\n\n252\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.190\nSo you better have some\nbackup gear stored somewhere.\n\n253\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.900\nBecause it's going to happen one of\nthese days, it's going to happen.\n\n254\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.960\nYeah, looking at fire suppression\nsystems is really important.\n\n255\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.760\nA couple things I look for\ninside data closets.\n\n256\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.100\nNormally, you don't have to worry\nabout this in a data center room.\n\n257\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.980\nSomebody's actually built a room for it.\n\n258\n00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.280\nBut I've seen bad examples of it.\n\n259\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.260\nIs things like,\nare there temperature sensors in place?\n\n260\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.950\nAre there smoke detectors in place and\nfire sensors, all three in place.\n\n261\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:51.380\nAnd most importantly, is there a system\nto alert staff when they're not there?\n\n262\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.070\nAfter hours, weekends, etc.,\ndo they have some kind of logging,\n\n263\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.440\nmonitoring system that will alert them\nto any kind of environmental problems.\n\n264\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.360\nI can tell you at least five or\n\n265\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.730\nsix instances I've seen where\nyou know it's a holiday weekend.\n\n266\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.340\nMaybe Memorial day weekend,\nwhich is coming up.\n\n267\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.100\nAnd the staff come back into the bank\non Monday morning and they find out\n\n268\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.930\nthat the air conditioning unit in\nthe server room failed over the weekend.\n\n269\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.730\nAnd it's 110 degrees.\n\n270\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.160\nAnd their servers are clacking,\nclacking, clacking,\n\n271\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.090\nand things are just about ready\nto go completely atomic on them.\n\n272\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.625\n>> Those babies tend to heat up.\n\n273\n00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:26.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n274\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.360\nyou want to be able to make sure that you\nnot only have adequate fire suppression\n\n275\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.510\nand all that, but you have monitoring\nsystems in place to keep of track of that.\n\n276\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.860\nEnvironmental monitoring.\n\n277\n00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.810\nToday it's really interesting, you can\nget very inexpensive units that mount\n\n278\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:45.360\nright into the rack that will immediately\ntrip a camera if someone enters the room.\n\n279\n00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.400\nIn case there's an unauthorized access,\nbut\n\n280\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.300\nalso we'll monitor temperature,\nhumidity, etc.\n\n281\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.040\nA lot of places like in the St.\n\n282\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.940\nLouis area,\ngotta be really careful about flooding.\n\n283\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.190\nThat river comes out of\nits banks all the time.\n\n284\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.590\nAnd you may not be in the flood zone,\nbut if the power fails and\n\n285\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.820\nthe sump pumps in the building\nstop working, you can very quickly\n\n286\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.060\nfind yourself in a flooded situation and\nnot have planned for it adequately.\n\n287\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.750\nSo, you gotta plan for flooding.\n\n288\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.200\nYou gotta plan for fires,\nbreak-ins, failed foundations.\n\n289\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.920\nBasements are never a good place to put\ntelecommunications or server gear, but\n\n290\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.570\npeople do it all the time,\nbecause it's the only place they have.\n\n291\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.150\nThey just simply don't build\nthose kinds of things to do that.\n\n292\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.290\nIt's not a good idea to do that.\n\n293\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.000\nThey need to be in well ventilated areas,\nproper power,\n\n294\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.150\nadequate power,\neven doing things like line filtering.\n\n295\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.940\nMost people don't know that but\n\n296\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.520\nmost 110 voltage outlets provide\nwhat we call dirty power.\n\n297\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.570\nBut it doesn't bother most\nequipment that we use.\n\n298\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.860\nBut if you're using high-performance,\nvery specialized server equipment,\n\n299\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.690\nyou want to get the most\nlifetime out of that.\n\n300\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.670\nYou wanna filter the power so\n\n301\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.610\nthat it gets a constant voltage\nlevel that never fluctuates.\n\n302\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.900\nBecause those fluctuations\nwill wear out or\n\n303\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.675\ndamage power supplies over\nlong periods of time.\n\n304\n00:19:10.675 --> 00:19:15.270\nLet's talk about physical\ncontrols around the building, for\n\n305\n00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.870\ninstance fences, bollards.\n\n306\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.160\nI don't know if you know bollards are.\n\n307\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.040\nBollards are those great big,\ngigantic round things that stick up outta\n\n308\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.650\nthe concrete that protect\nfederal buildings.\n\n309\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.810\nThat can take the weight of\na semi truck hitting them and\n\n310\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.370\nthey won't move, believe me.\n\n311\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.850\nYou do not wanna tie into one of those.\n\n312\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.560\nIn Washington DC they actually have\nmechanical bollards that will come up out\n\n313\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.180\nof the ground in event of an emergency\nthat completely surround the White House\n\n314\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.880\nand places like that, so then-\n>> Yeah,\n\n315\n00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.700\nI think the Pentagon has them as well,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n316\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.690\n>> They're everywhere today, yeah.\n\n317\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.660\nSo, those kind of things.\n\n318\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.040\nBut in most locations, like hospitals,\nbanks, etc., I look for\n\n319\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.050\nthings like adequate lighting,\nare window's\n\n320\n00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.800\nin a position where, used to do this all\nthe time when I would do bank audits,\n\n321\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.540\nwhen I'd do a physical sweep.\n\n322\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.970\nWalk up and pull my, my phone out and\ntake a picture through the window\n\n323\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.740\nof documents sitting on\na vice president's desk.\n\n324\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.120\nAnd then go in the next day and show\nthem at the exit interview and say look,\n\n325\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.250\nyou really need to do\nsomething about this.\n\n326\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.850\nEither don't leave your documents out or\nput blinds on the windows and close them.\n\n327\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.300\nBecause a bad guy could do exactly that.\n\n328\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.420\nCome in and take a picture of signatures.\n\n329\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.930\nI found everything from home mortgages\nto loans to cash laying out on tables,\n\n330\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.810\nall kinds of things like that.\n\n331\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:38.810\nSo you want to take a look at the physical\nenvironment, how are locks handled?\n\n332\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.680\nThere's a section in the book\nthat talks about locks.\n\n333\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.960\nAnd you can do some search on Google,\n\n334\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.740\nif you want, about the different kinds\nof locks, dead bolts verses pin locks.\n\n335\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.530\nVersus electronic locks,\nweather locks are key cards,\n\n336\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.700\nor they use biometric authentication,\na thumb print or\n\n337\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.360\nthe last place I worked a few\nyears ago had a retina scanner.\n\n338\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.650\nNow this is another a great example of\nsomething that I looked at as a auditor.\n\n339\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.300\nI always scratched my head about was they\nspent a lot of money for a retina scanner.\n\n340\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.380\nIt's a fairly expensive system prone\nto errors, unless you buy really,\n\n341\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.820\nreally good ones.\n\n342\n00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.752\nAnd they had them installed\nin both locations.\n\n343\n00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:30.050\nAnd yet I would have to walk up and\nshine my little eye into\n\n344\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.360\nthe retina scanner and it would go clink,\nturn green and the door would unlatch.\n\n345\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.890\nAnd then I'd have to reach over and\ngrab it.\n\n346\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.760\nWell, number one, there was nobody there\nto ensure that people didn't tailgate.\n\n347\n00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.460\nTailgate is when I walk in at the same\ntime somebody else does without\n\n348\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.170\nme authenticating.\n\n349\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.310\nAnd number two they had\nno visitors log [LAUGH].\n\n350\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.815\nSo I look for visitors logs,\nespecially in banks.\n\n351\n00:21:51.815 --> 00:21:55.260\nIt's really critical in banks you need\nto know who's in those buildings.\n\n352\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.720\nI did an audit for a very large health\ncare organization a number of years ago\n\n353\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.470\nwho had just built a new data center\nin their new executive offices and\n\n354\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.850\nthey didn't require anyone to\nsign in when they showed up.\n\n355\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.340\nAnd I said well what if there\nwas a fire or a tornado,\n\n356\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.520\nhow would EMS services know\nwho might be in the building.\n\n357\n00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.590\nThey don't.\nYou have a list of employees but\n\n358\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.610\nyou don't know who else is there visiting.\n\n359\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.960\nSo today they now have not only\na guard watching that, but\n\n360\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.010\neveryone who comes in\nthe building has to sign in.\n\n361\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.090\n>> Yeah, the building I worked\nat we had armed guards and\n\n362\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.980\nthey did have a check in station.\n\n363\n00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.920\nAll visitors had to show up in the front.\n\n364\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.680\nYou couldn't get into any of the other\naccesses we had, key cards for\n\n365\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.970\nlocks on the other accesses.\n\n366\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.950\nHad to go into the front, sign in,\nwhen their time was, your time out.\n\n367\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.320\nSo we all, like you said,\n\n368\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.360\nif you don't know they're there,\nhow can I say that they did anything?\n\n369\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.250\nYou have no record of it whatsoever.\n\n370\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.710\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n371\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.760\nSo that's some of the stuff, in terms of\n\n372\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.910\nMaking sure that you're familiar\nwith physical access controls.\n\n373\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.550\nThen the last thing is we wrap\nup the session here today.\n\n374\n00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.510\nAnd I wanna talk a little bit about,\nlogical access controls.\n\n375\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.550\nSo the biometrics, you'll have to know\na little bit about biometric controls and\n\n376\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.310\nhow all that works.\n\n377\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:13.160\nThat's generally used for authenticating\nagainst, like we've said a door lock.\n\n378\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.690\nIt could be against a laptop as well but\n\n379\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.600\nyou don't see that typically\nin most environments.\n\n380\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.110\nNow I want to talk about logical\naccess controls which are things like\n\n381\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.850\nactive directory user names and passwords.\n\n382\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.800\nLogical meaning virtual where\nthere's really nothing real there.\n\n383\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:36.250\nBut, those are the controls\nused to authenticate and\n\n384\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.600\nallow access to information for\nwhich you're authorized to view.\n\n385\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.780\nTo protect, again, that confidentiality.\n\n386\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:50.636\nLogical access, controls,\ncan involve everything from usernames and\n\n387\n00:23:50.636 --> 00:23:55.287\npasswords Actually sometimes\nwe use biometrics,\n\n388\n00:23:55.287 --> 00:24:01.033\nfacial recognition,\nkeyboard dynamics, things like that.\n\n389\n00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.611\nWe're moving up the stack, if you will,\n\n390\n00:24:03.611 --> 00:24:06.495\nfrom physical controls\nto logical controls.\n\n391\n00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:11.693\nWe're talking about Software\nimplementations, things like that,\n\n392\n00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:17.417\nthat will allow us to put controls in\nplace to protect access to those assets so\n\n393\n00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:20.868\nthat only the authorized\npeople can see them.\n\n394\n00:24:20.868 --> 00:24:26.394\nSo that the data can't be messed with,\nfor lack of a better term,\n\n395\n00:24:26.394 --> 00:24:31.216\nso that we can maintain\nthe integrity of the data set, and\n\n396\n00:24:31.216 --> 00:24:34.850\nso that data is accessible\nwhen we need it.\n\n397\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.850\nI think that's about as\nfar as I wanna go today.\n\n398\n00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.410\nTomorrow, or in the next episode,\nI'm sorry, what we're gonna talk about\n\n399\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:46.670\nare some more network and\ninternet security protocols\n\n400\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.430\nthat go hand in hand with the logical\naccess controls we're talking about.\n\n401\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.080\nSo logical access controllers\nare like usernames and passwords etc.\n\n402\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.790\nNext we're going to start as we explore\nthe open system interconnection model.\n\n403\n00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.000\nWe're going to talk some more\nabout security protocols that\n\n404\n00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.100\nwill secure transmissions of information\nacross media such as the airwaves,\n\n405\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.180\nand or cables, copper and fiber, right?\n\n406\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.800\n>> That will definitely be a lot of fun.\n\n407\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.270\nAnd if you haven't realized so far,\njust starting at the physical layer,\n\n408\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.270\nwe're gonna talk, like you said,\nmore about the OSI model.\n\n409\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.420\nJust things you can touch,\nthings you can do to put up a fence.\n\n410\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.710\nIf you're not thinking of\nthings like an air conditioner.\n\n411\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.650\nWell, if the air conditioner is\npumping AC into my server room, and\n\n412\n00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.530\nI run over there and I jam a stick in it,\nand it stops running,\n\n413\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.210\nwell what's going to\nhappen to my server room?\n\n414\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.850\nI've effectively given\na denial of service attack by\n\n415\n00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.220\njust attacking an air conditioner.\n\n416\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.180\nThese are the ways that we've\ngot to think, and as auditors,\n\n417\n00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.330\nthis is how we're We're helping\nthe companies that we're auditing, right?\n\n418\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.990\nWe're thinking about these things for\nthem.\n\n419\n00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.900\nMaybe they haven't had the level of\ntraining that we're going through right\n\n420\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.010\nnow to think outside of the box really.\n\n421\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.040\nHow will an attacker come in?\n\n422\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.350\nI would have never thought to\ngo outside of a VP's desk and\n\n423\n00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.760\ntry to take pictures of\ndocuments on his desk.\n\n424\n00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.030\nAnd you could easily get away with it.\n\n425\n00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.210\nEven if you got caught doing it,\n\n426\n00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.628\nou say, I was just taking pictures\nof the bushes that are here.\n\n427\n00:26:08.628 --> 00:26:11.332\nI thought it was a pretty bush,\nI wanted to send it to my wife and\n\n428\n00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:13.528\nask her what kind it is,\nmaybe we'll plant them.\n\n429\n00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:16.700\nThings of that nature you just social\nengineer your way right out of it and\n\n430\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.900\nthey go okay, sorry, well have a good one.\n\n431\n00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.100\nWell there you are, and\n\n432\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.790\nyou got all the great information\nthat you've been looking for.\n\n433\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.940\nSo it's these things that we\nhave to keep in our minds.\n\n434\n00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.010\nAnd of course the common things like fire,\nfloods and all those other disasters, but\n\n435\n00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.220\neven though we think about them,\nare we implementing them correctly?\n\n436\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.496\nBrian says he has gone in and said,\n\n437\n00:26:35.496 --> 00:26:38.048\nwhy do you have you have your switch\nunderneath this sprinkler head?\n\n438\n00:26:38.048 --> 00:26:39.768\nWell, it's the only\nplace we had to put it.\n\n439\n00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:42.810\nWell, that's great, but\nyou have to take account for that.\n\n440\n00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.640\nYou have to be ready in\nthe fact if a fire does happen\n\n441\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.920\nmaybe it's on the other end of the\nbuilding but it's sets off that sprinkler,\n\n442\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.610\nyou're going to lose that switch,\nyou're going to lose that equipment.\n\n443\n00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.170\nSo be prepared for that as well.\n\n444\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.800\nBrian, we thank you for enlightening us to\nthese facts, and making us think in this\n\n445\n00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.620\nway so that we're more effective as\nauditors as we get out there in the field.\n\n446\n00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.540\nThat being said, it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another great show.\n\n447\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.010\nAgain, don't forget to get yourself\na copy of the Sybex book on\n\n448\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:12.370\nthe CISA Fourth Edition,\nat least one of the authors is Brian here,\n\n449\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.060\nwho is helping us walk\nthrough this information.\n\n450\n00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.470\nAnd it looks like we've wrapped\nup another great episode so\n\n451\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.610\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n452\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.528\nFor IT ProTV I've been your host,\nDaniel Laurie.\n\n453\n00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:22.808\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n454\n00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:24.968\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n455\n00:27:24.968 --> 00:27:32.590\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.323\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:21.816\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CISA series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:25.550\nThat's right, the Certified\nInformation Systems Auditor, and\n\n7\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.356\njoining us in the studio today.\n\n8\n00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:31.312\nOne of the authors of this wonderful\nstudy guide that we've been using, is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:32.160\nBrian O'Hara.\n\n10\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.110\nBrian, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840\n>> Good morning, thank you Daniel,\nit's going well.\n\n12\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.770\nSo for those of you out in viewer land,\n\n13\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.660\nI wanted to do a little bit of\na review from our last session.\n\n14\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.491\nExcuse me, we're in domain five now.\n\n15\n00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.852\nWe're in the home stretch of the video\nseries protecting IP assets.\n\n16\n00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:56.860\nIf you recall from your study guides,\nthis is 25% of the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.794\nSo it's the largest chunk and\nrepresents I believe if you do the math,\n\n18\n00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.976\nI think it's 30 questions.\n\n19\n00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:08.075\nSo it's really important that you read\nthrough this chapter six, seven and\n\n20\n00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.980\neight in the book will\ngo into great details.\n\n21\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.613\nI'm going to do two specialty\nsessions later today or\n\n22\n00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.823\nlater in the series I guess,\nsince the days doesn't matter.\n\n23\n00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:19.613\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah,\n\n24\n00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:23.725\nI'm gonna do one on the open\nsystems interconnection model.\n\n25\n00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:28.701\nWhere we're gonna talk in very,\nvery much detail how data actually\n\n26\n00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.890\nmoves across our other medium\nthat we choose to use.\n\n27\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.693\nAnd I'm also going to do an in-depth\npresentation on public key infrastructure\n\n28\n00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:38.761\nand encryption.\n\n29\n00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:42.948\nBecause I've found that,\nover the years with students,\n\n30\n00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:48.180\nthose were the two of the more difficult\nconcepts to get down correctly.\n\n31\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.590\nSo just for a quick review from yesterday,\n\n32\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.440\nwe started off talking\nabout the CIA triad.\n\n33\n00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.470\nThe CIA standing for confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n34\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.560\nAnd the importance of all three of those.\n\n35\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.963\nWe're gonna talk even more about\nthat in this episode as we begin\n\n36\n00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:09.662\nto get into talking about things like.\n\n37\n00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.286\nBiometric authentication mechanisms,\nencryption,\n\n38\n00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:18.623\ndigital signatures in email and\nother items, etc.\n\n39\n00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:22.869\nThey all sort of wrap\naround that CIA triad.\n\n40\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.066\nWe've talked a little bit in the previous\nepisode about physical controls.\n\n41\n00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.602\nWe talked about fire suppression systems,\nand locks on doors,\n\n42\n00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:34.117\ndifferent kinds of locks.\n\n43\n00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:41.230\nKey locks, key-card locks,\npunch-button locks, things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530\nYou should be familiar with most of those.\n\n45\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.590\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit more\nin detail today about biometric systems.\n\n46\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.930\nIn particular, iris scanners, retina\nscanners, handprints, that kind of stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.456\nSo and then later, like I said,\nwe'll talk when we get into the OSI model,\n\n48\n00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:05.218\nwe'll talk some more\ndetail about network and\n\n49\n00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:10.440\ninter-network security protocols\nsuch as HTTPS, SSH, etc.\n\n50\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.730\nSo this morning, I want to get going here\nby talking more in depth about biometrics.\n\n51\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.959\nLet's move onto that as we talk\nabout logical access controls.\n\n52\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.539\nThere's a number of different kinds\nof biometric mechanisms that the book\n\n53\n00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.779\ndiscusses as well.\n\n54\n00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:33.600\nThat will be on your exam, that you're\nexpected to have a basic understanding in.\n\n55\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.272\nAgain, you're not required to know\nthe details of how an iris scanner\n\n56\n00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:38.153\nmachine works.\n\n57\n00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:41.323\nBut you need to know the difference\nbetween an iris scanner, and\n\n58\n00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:42.400\na retina scanner.\n\n59\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.059\nOr, a hand scanner, hand being a palm and\na fingerprint scanner,\n\n60\n00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:53.123\nyou need to know that there\nare differences between those.\n\n61\n00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:55.884\nWe'll also talk a little bit\nabout facial recognition.\n\n62\n00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:59.707\nI don't know if any of you out there,\nand this part isn't on the exam, but\n\n63\n00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:02.390\nany of you out there who\nhave Windows 10 now.\n\n64\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.860\nThere's a new feature called Hello, which\nuses facial recognition on Windows 10.\n\n65\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.240\nAs facial recognition software becomes\nmore and more sophisticated, and more and\n\n66\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.630\nmore reliable.\n\n67\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.190\nI strongly believe that you're going to\nsee more and more of that come into play.\n\n68\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.882\nApple iPhones today use\nfingerprint technology.\n\n69\n00:04:21.882 --> 00:04:26.430\nIt would only make perfect sense maybe\nin the next version of the iPhone 7s.\n\n70\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.240\nEventually, I believe you're going to\nsee facial recognition on those phones.\n\n71\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.750\nAs maybe an addition to thumb print or\nto take the place of thumb prints.\n\n72\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.369\nBecause then again, it doesn't require you\nto do anything other than hold the device\n\n73\n00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:40.083\nin front of you.\n\n74\n00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.790\nWhich is what you're gonna do\nnaturally anyways to do something.\n\n75\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.488\nIt makes perfect sense, if I need to\nlook at my phone I just pick it up and\n\n76\n00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:49.339\nit automatically recognizes my face and\nunlocks it.\n\n77\n00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:52.734\nVersus having to do something which is\nwhat you have to do today with your\n\n78\n00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:53.480\nfingerprint.\n\n79\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.098\nFacial recognition software has\nbeen developed over the years.\n\n80\n00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:03.858\nThe stuff you see in\nthe movies is more in Polic,\n\n81\n00:05:03.858 --> 00:05:07.352\nor FBI stuff or in casinos, in particular.\n\n82\n00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:11.000\nCasinos use sophisticated and\n\n83\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.350\nexpensive facial recognition\nsoftware to track gamblers,\n\n84\n00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.670\nfrom table to table, and\nor from casino to casino.\n\n85\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.880\nCuz oftentimes,\nthe same people own multiple casinos.\n\n86\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.440\nAnd they want to see if people\nare coming in and card counting,\n\n87\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.910\nmaking a lot of money and going to another\nplace, and it helps them track that.\n\n88\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.410\n>> Yeah, my uncle actually owns a company\nthat does biometrics for the government.\n\n89\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.885\nAnd his software and\n\n90\n00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:41.015\nsystems were the ones that were used\nto find Bin Laden with the drones.\n\n91\n00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:44.251\nAnd he got to go on the news and\neverything, and had a cool little thing.\n\n92\n00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:47.920\nBut that's what they do they create\nportable hand scanners, iris scanners,\n\n93\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.772\nretina scanners, thumb scanners,\nall that type of stuff.\n\n94\n00:05:50.772 --> 00:05:52.806\nIt's a really cool technology and\n\n95\n00:05:52.806 --> 00:05:56.179\nwe are getting better [COUGH]\nat making it cheaper as well.\n\n96\n00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:58.434\nBecause before we had things, my laptop,\n\n97\n00:05:58.434 --> 00:06:02.650\nit's got a camera on it we can use\nthat facial recognition software.\n\n98\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.760\nBut what if I just hold up\na picture of my face, right?\n\n99\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.438\nThen that was one way to get around\nthat as a security lock out.\n\n100\n00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:10.483\n>> Correct.\n\n101\n00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:13.803\n>> But now they're looking for even heat\nsignatures, is this a real person or\n\n102\n00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:15.250\nis it just a picture, right?\n\n103\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.120\n>> Or three dimensional.\n\n104\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.970\n>> Yes, three dimensional.\n\n105\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.253\n>> [CROSSTALK] being able to do three\ndimensional depth perception on it.\n\n106\n00:06:20.253 --> 00:06:24.941\nYeah, and it's interesting,\nbecause for years we've thought that\n\n107\n00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:29.630\nvoice recognition would be really\nthe way that biometrics would go.\n\n108\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.880\nAnd there's still some hope for\nvoice recognition.\n\n109\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.080\nThere's some particular\napplications where that's used.\n\n110\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.460\nBut voice and facial recognition seem\nto both be sort of climbing the ladder.\n\n111\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.260\nAnd I think facial recognition will\neventually probably take the most\n\n112\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.259\nbecause again,\nwith facial recognition it's passive.\n\n113\n00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.230\nThe viewer doesn't have to do anything.\n\n114\n00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.540\nI can use a camera and\n\n115\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.190\ncapture a picture of you where with voice\nrecognition you have to say something.\n\n116\n00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.150\nI have to trick you into saying something.\n\n117\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.942\nWe get a voice with visual recognition or\n\n118\n00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:05.959\nfacial recognition all I have to do is\nlook at you, point a camera at you.\n\n119\n00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:11.118\nAnd as things get more sophisticated\nwe are looking at Apple\n\n120\n00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:16.912\ncomputers now with five thousand or\nfive-k resolution screens.\n\n121\n00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:19.687\nThere won't be long,\nthere'll be 10K screens.\n\n122\n00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:21.457\nThe resolution is going to become so\n\n123\n00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:24.709\ngood that they will be able to\ndetect three dimensional objects.\n\n124\n00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:28.000\nAnd like you said,\nmaybe build in heat signatures, etc.\n\n125\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.934\nBe like a little MRI,\nor something like that.\n\n126\n00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:31.582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It'll get pretty weird.\n\n127\n00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:36.447\nAnyway, for the moment, one of\nthe things that you'll need to probably\n\n128\n00:07:36.447 --> 00:07:41.420\nhave a little better grasp on are hand\nprint and finger print biometrics.\n\n129\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:49.964\nThose are some of the subsets that we talk\nabout because they're most often used.\n\n130\n00:07:49.964 --> 00:07:53.350\nAnd they're some of the cheapest\nbecause they've been around for awhile.\n\n131\n00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.676\nSo many laptops, for instance, today,\n\n132\n00:07:55.676 --> 00:08:00.128\nhave a fingerprint biometric sensor on\nthem that you can use if you're That is,\n\n133\n00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:04.323\nif you're purchasing a, what we\nwould call, business-class machine.\n\n134\n00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:08.095\nConsumer devices, so much, like you would\nbuy at Best Buy or something probably\n\n135\n00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:11.490\naren't gonna have those on there,\nbecause they cost a little bit more.\n\n136\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.090\nBut most business machines will have\nsoftware pre-installed in the device for\n\n137\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.900\nyou to use your fingerprint,\nto add another layer, or\n\n138\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.520\nanother factor of authentication.\n\n139\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.550\nI'm gonna talk about multi-factor\nauthentication here in a little bit.\n\n140\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.208\nAnother subset are what we call\nbehavioral techniques, and you'll need to\n\n141\n00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.478\nknow these for the exam, and\nyou need to read about them in the book.\n\n142\n00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:37.330\nSome of those are what we\nwill call signature dynamics.\n\n143\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.760\nI'm not really sure how effective and\n\n144\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.650\nhow successful these have been, but\nit's certainly some interesting research.\n\n145\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.648\nSignature dynamics,\nmeaning how you sign your name,\n\n146\n00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:55.070\nhow you write.\n\n147\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.820\nSo most people have a specific way\nthat they write their signature and\n\n148\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.950\neven a good forger has a very difficult\ntime reproducing those things.\n\n149\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.224\nThat's what handwriting experts\nused to do in check writing cases,\n\n150\n00:09:09.224 --> 00:09:12.678\ncome in to court and testify and\nsay, that's not the guy's signature.\n\n151\n00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:18.628\nIt's difficult to tell the difference,\nbut it is doable.\n\n152\n00:09:18.628 --> 00:09:22.866\nAnd with computer software today\nwhat they're looking at is ways for\n\n153\n00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:26.154\nthe computer software to be smarter,\nor as smart as,\n\n154\n00:09:26.154 --> 00:09:29.400\nthe signature handwriting\nanalysis people are.\n\n155\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.730\nThat's not so much a big one, the one that\nreally seems to be or had a little bit of\n\n156\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.230\na place there for a while in\nthe business was keyboard dynamics.\n\n157\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.860\nIf you aren't aware,\neveryone types a little bit differently.\n\n158\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.049\nDaniel and I were talking the other day\nabout how he doesn't really like the Mac\n\n159\n00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:50.258\nkeyboard all that much and I do, so we\nboth have very different ways of typing.\n\n160\n00:09:50.258 --> 00:09:54.892\nAnd it turns out that keyboard\ndynamics are very much like signature\n\n161\n00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:59.048\ndynamics in that everyone kind\nof types things the same way.\n\n162\n00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:05.766\nLike the user names and passwords in terms\nof the amount of time between keystrokes,\n\n163\n00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:11.648\nhow hard you press the key, whether\nyou hit certain keys together or not.\n\n164\n00:10:11.648 --> 00:10:15.555\nLike when I type my passwords I will go,\nbang, bang, bang, bang, bang,\n\n165\n00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:17.520\ncuz I already know what's coming.\n\n166\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.980\nSo I'll go dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.\n\n167\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.551\nAnd I won't tell what the characters are.\n\n168\n00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:21.651\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes.\n\n169\n00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:24.171\n>> Almost sounds like\nan accent in our language.\n\n170\n00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:26.780\n>> Exactly, exactly, very distinguishable.\n\n171\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.050\nSo keyboard dynamics,\n\n172\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.018\nthe problem with that is there's software\nthat has to be deployed on every machine.\n\n173\n00:10:32.018 --> 00:10:35.800\nCuz otherwise if you go\nto a different machine,\n\n174\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.550\nthat website doesn't know\nyour keyboard dynamics.\n\n175\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.786\nOr if you wanted websites to do it, to act\nas another form of authentication for you,\n\n176\n00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:45.008\nthen they would have\nto load more software.\n\n177\n00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:48.649\nAnd that makes their sites run more\nslower and more complicated, and\n\n178\n00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.426\njust not really very effective.\n\n179\n00:10:50.426 --> 00:10:55.220\n[COUGH] Excuse me, and then we talked\nabout, or I mentioned earlier,\n\n180\n00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.900\nabout a voice recognition software.\n\n181\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.328\nVoice recognition software\njust hasn't really taken off.\n\n182\n00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:07.243\nVoice recognition is\nstill even problematic\n\n183\n00:11:07.243 --> 00:11:11.128\nin the field of converting to text.\n\n184\n00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:15.164\nWhere you might have a program\nlike Dragon Naturally Speaking, or\n\n185\n00:11:15.164 --> 00:11:18.190\nsomething like that where\nit learns your voice and\n\n186\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.660\neven over a fairly long period\nof time can still make mistakes.\n\n187\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:28.180\nSo it's really not very reliable, and so\nit's not used very often unless it's used\n\n188\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.250\nin conjunction with another type or two\ntypes or three types of authentication.\n\n189\n00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.150\nSo when using voice recognition, it\nmight be used in conjunction with facial\n\n190\n00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.410\nrecognition or fingerprint or thumbprint\nor keyboard dynamics, something like that.\n\n191\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.150\nNone of these are really,\nreally reliable on their own.\n\n192\n00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.260\nThey're usually more reliable\nwhen they're used together\n\n193\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.090\nin conjunction with another type\nof authentication mechanism.\n\n194\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.610\nLet me just stop and\ntake a second and talk about that.\n\n195\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.750\nAt the moment,\nwhat we're really talking about,\n\n196\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.460\nin terms of protecting information assets,\nis the authentication process,\n\n197\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:13.010\nproving you are who you say you are or\nwho you're presenting yourself to be.\n\n198\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.890\nWe haven't got to authorization yet,\n\n199\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.970\nwhich is another stage in\nprotecting information assets.\n\n200\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.520\nWhich is okay, now that I know who\nyou are, and I've verified and\n\n201\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.310\nvalidated that,\nwhat am I gonna give you access to?\n\n202\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.360\nThat's authorization, at this point,\n\n203\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.000\nwe're still only talking\nabout authentication, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.090\nWanted to make sure that that was clear.\n\n205\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:40.840\nNow, the next part of this is I wanna talk\na little bit about reliability, in detail.\n\n206\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.040\nBecause you will need to know\nthis on the exams and the book.\n\n207\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.410\nWink wink, write these down,\ntake good notes.\n\n208\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.930\nWe just saw a note online\nfrom one of our viewers,\n\n209\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.190\nit says, Android 4 has face unlock.\n\n210\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.830\nI wasn't aware of that.\n\n211\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.670\nIt would be interesting to know, maybe you\ncan IM him and ask him how reliable is it?\n\n212\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.750\nDoes it work 100% of the time,\nor does he have problems?\n\n213\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.690\n>> That's a good question.\n\n214\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.230\n>> Or maybe like he said put a picture in\nfront of it and see if it recognizes that.\n\n215\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.700\nMaybe we can talk to\nthat viewer later online.\n\n216\n00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.797\nAnyway, I wanted you to know about what we\n\n217\n00:13:15.797 --> 00:13:23.238\nwould call error problems with\nbiometric authentication.\n\n218\n00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:28.067\nErrors in biometric\nauthentication basically come\n\n219\n00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:33.520\ndown to what we call type one and\ntype two errors, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.220\nRemember this, this is important.\n\n221\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:41.970\nType one error is a false rejection,\nthat means that someone\n\n222\n00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.410\nwho should have been authorized wasn't,\nthat's why it's called a false rejection.\n\n223\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.000\nIt falsely rejected somebody who\nshould have been authorized,\n\n224\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.350\nand there's a type two error,\nwhich is a false acceptance.\n\n225\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.450\nThat means somebody got allowed access or\nexcuse me was\n\n226\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.840\nyes, identified that should not have been.\n\n227\n00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.070\nSo like Daniel said,\nmaybe somebody took a picture of him and\n\n228\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.750\nput it in front of the camera and\nthe camera accepted that.\n\n229\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.010\nThat would be an example\nof a type two error.\n\n230\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.360\nA type one error would be\nwhen he looked at the screen\n\n231\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.790\nhe smiled rather than frowned.\n\n232\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.670\nWhen it took the original\npicture he was frowning, and so\n\n233\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.020\nit didn't recognize his smile.\n\n234\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.680\nThat would be a false rejection or\na type one error.\n\n235\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.540\nVery important you understand\nthe difference between the two of those.\n\n236\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.710\nI can almost guarantee you\nwill see a couple of questions\n\n237\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.610\non the exam about that.\n\n238\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.500\nSo please read up on that in the book,\nokay.\n\n239\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.060\nDid we get any answers\nback from our viewer yet?\n\n240\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.676\n>> It's unlikely.\n\n241\n00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:48.006\n[LAUGH].\n>> Okay, so that's the first piece of\n\n242\n00:14:48.006 --> 00:14:53.786\nprotecting information assets\nI want to talk about today.\n\n243\n00:14:53.786 --> 00:14:58.390\nWe talked about authorization,\nnow I need to jump to a little different\n\n244\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.722\nspot because I want to talk about malware.\n\n245\n00:15:02.722 --> 00:15:06.550\nOkay, so let's kinda draw a line in\nthe sand, we'll go to next section.\n\n246\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.670\nI'll take a little drink of coffee, and\n\n247\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.772\nwe'll talk about threats to\nthose information assets.\n\n248\n00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:19.250\nOkay, cuz again we're talking about\nhow to protect information assets, so\n\n249\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.730\nwe have to know what the threats are.\n\n250\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.460\nObviously authorization is about,\nor excuse me,\n\n251\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.210\nidentification is about ensuring\nconfidentiality that only\n\n252\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.780\nthe people who say they are, you verify\nthat they are who they say they are.\n\n253\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:41.150\nNow they can get to the data that you've\ngiven them permission to have access to.\n\n254\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:46.031\nLet's talk about the kinds of things\nthat will take advantage of that and\n\n255\n00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:51.154\ntry to destroy data, block you from\ngetting access, change permissions,\n\n256\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:55.337\ndo all that kind of stuff,\nto break that CIA triad if you will.\n\n257\n00:15:55.337 --> 00:16:00.336\nI have a friend down in, actually\ndown in South Florida, Carl Fluea,\n\n258\n00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:05.676\nwho from, I'll just say Carls,\nwho talks about a three-legged stool and\n\n259\n00:16:05.676 --> 00:16:09.944\nhe's talking about hip and\nhigh tech and the omnibus rule.\n\n260\n00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:14.127\nI actually like that concept\nbetter than the CIA triad,\n\n261\n00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:18.488\ncuz with the triad you get this\npicture of this triangle and\n\n262\n00:16:18.488 --> 00:16:21.530\ntriangles are pretty solid, you know?\n\n263\n00:16:23.638 --> 00:16:28.420\nWith a three-legged stool if you break any\none of those legs, it's going to collapse.\n\n264\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.620\n>> It ceases to be a stool at that point.\n\n265\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.930\n>> Exactly [LAUGH] it\ndoesn't hold much up.\n\n266\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.360\nAnd that's exactly what we're\ntalking about with malware and\n\n267\n00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.490\nthreats to information assets is if you\nbreak any one of those legs whether it\n\n268\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.520\nbe availability,\nwe'll talk about some threats to that.\n\n269\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.665\nOr whether it's integrity,\n\n270\n00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:52.590\nand/or a combination of those,\nor confidentiality.\n\n271\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.290\nIf it breaks any one or more of those,\n\n272\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.480\nit has kind of destroyed your ability\nto protect those information assets.\n\n273\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.050\nSo I want you to write\nsome of these terms down.\n\n274\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.360\nLook them up in the book,\nread up some more on.\n\n275\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.290\nWe're not gonna go into super\ndetail on them in this series.\n\n276\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.350\nBut I want you to be familiar with them.\n\n277\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.150\nFirst as a virus.\n\n278\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.818\nA virus is a program that attachs\nitself to another program and\n\n279\n00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:19.239\ntries to do harm to the device\nand/or connected devices.\n\n280\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.240\nI think we're all familiar what\nviruses are, we all run, hopefully,\n\n281\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.730\nantivirus software.\n\n282\n00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.380\nAs an auditor, you need to ensure that\nthe companies that you're working with\n\n283\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.570\nare running adequate antivirus solutions,\nthat they're updating\n\n284\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.480\ntheir patterns on a regular basis, that\nthey're scanning on a regular basis, and\n\n285\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.770\nthat, if there are trends,\nwill go back to root cause analysis again.\n\n286\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.670\nIf you start seeing trends of\ncertain groups of people who seem\n\n287\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.520\nto be continually getting infected,\nyou see certain times of day,\n\n288\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.140\ncertain days of the week, certain days of\nthe month, all those data analytics begin\n\n289\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.640\nto drive investigations into how and\nwhy those things are happening and\n\n290\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.710\nhelp you do root cause analysis to again\nmanage the risk of the organization.\n\n291\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.750\nNeed to know what a trojan is.\n\n292\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.490\nIt's just that, it's something\nthat look innocuous that's not.\n\n293\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:17.890\nA word document, or a PDF document that\nyou get in an email, or, excuse me.\n\n294\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.830\nYou download a game,\noff of some website, and\n\n295\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.000\nbingo, you install it, and\nit puts a backdoor on your machine.\n\n296\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.770\nThose are called trojans.\n\n297\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.210\nA bot, or a bot,\nlet's talk about bots next.\n\n298\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.460\nBut let's talk about bots,\nwhich is short for robots.\n\n299\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.790\nBots are little pieces of software,\nthat can come in a dozen different ways.\n\n300\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.770\nThey can be delivered via trojans.\n\n301\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.320\nSo someone can send you a word document,\nand you double click and open, lo and\n\n302\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.220\nbehold, you don't know it, but\nit actually installs bots on your machine.\n\n303\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:57.770\nBots or robots are designed to phone home,\n\n304\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:06.355\nis what we call it from the old ET\nmovie and send information back.\n\n305\n00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:09.900\nAnd/or open a communication channel\nto the, what we call a command and\n\n306\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.150\ncontrol center.\n\n307\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.840\nSo that they can do other things.\n\n308\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.140\nMaybe they wanna download\nmore malware onto the system.\n\n309\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.510\nNow that they have\na communication channel open,\n\n310\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.640\nthey can do that without being detected,\nor things like that.\n\n311\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.020\nAnd you hear about these botnets\nin the news all the time,\n\n312\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.870\nbecause the way that they\nreplicate will cause them to\n\n313\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:34.630\nbecome infected in humongous numbers,\nnetworks all over the world.\n\n314\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.580\nAnd they're very quiet,\nthey're very stealthy,\n\n315\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.015\nthey're very difficult to detect.\n\n316\n00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:41.210\nAnti-virus signatures do\nnot always detect them,\n\n317\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.370\nit requires other kinds\nof tools often times.\n\n318\n00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.650\nThen they're constantly morphing or\nchanging.\n\n319\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.270\nSo very difficult to detecting and\nget off of our systems.\n\n320\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.570\n>> So basically hackers are amassing\ntheir own private little stealth army\n\n321\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.500\nof computers out there.\n\n322\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.450\nSo when they want to attack a target, when\nthey have the correct amount of numbers\n\n323\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.110\nthat they feel adequate,\nthen they'll use them.\n\n324\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.000\n>> Well yeah, it's interesting you're\nbringing that up cuz that's gonna take me\n\n325\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.340\nto my next conversation which is\nabout Denial Service Attacks and\n\n326\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.450\nDistributed Denial Service Attacks.\n\n327\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.480\nThat's a primary function that bots have\nserved in the past but they also provide\n\n328\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.100\ncommand and control communication channels\nwhere once they're inside your network\n\n329\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.960\nthey can also help you as a bad guy\ndeliver more malware inside the network.\n\n330\n00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.070\nBecause of that open\ncommunication channel.\n\n331\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.580\nBut what Daniel is referring to is\nwhat we call a Denial of Service or\n\n332\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.920\nDistributed Denial of Service.\n\n333\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.020\nLet me talk about Denial of Service first.\n\n334\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.690\nWhat that means is that I found\nsome way to interrupt availability.\n\n335\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:48.230\nSo on a website that might mean that I've\ndisconnected a switch or a router port.\n\n336\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:52.060\nIt could mean, so now that website's\nno longer available to the internet.\n\n337\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.110\nIt could be that I've infected it with\na virus that's causing the CPU to\n\n338\n00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.520\noverrun and overrun and\nfinally the machine crashes.\n\n339\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.580\nLots of different ways you can do that.\n\n340\n00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.670\nWhat Daniel was really talking about is\nwhat's called a Distributed Denial of\n\n341\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:11.020\nService attack which can be very,\nvery crippling to any network.\n\n342\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.870\nAnd that's where perhaps thousands or\n\n343\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.650\nmillions of bots are commanded\nfrom a command and control or\n\n344\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.820\nfrom multiple command and control centers\nto attack a specific node or network.\n\n345\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.780\nSo now you have for instance,\n250,000 home PCs in\n\n346\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.790\nthe United States infected\nwith these bots, and\n\n347\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.920\nat 3 o'clock in the morning they all\nwake up and they start coming across\n\n348\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.660\nthe Comcast network, and the Time Warner\nnetwork, all those cable and\n\n349\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.140\nDSL connections that Mom and\nPop have and they start attacking banks.\n\n350\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.870\nThey start attacking the Department\nof Defense, Offices in\n\n351\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.190\nthe Federal Government, whatever company\nof the day that they're attacking.\n\n352\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.460\nWhat they do is they flood\nthat victim's network with so\n\n353\n00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.660\nmuch traffic that the, that legitimate\ntraffic can no longer get through.\n\n354\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.830\nNow, we're talking 400 meg,\n\n355\n00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:12.390\nto over a gig or up to 10 gig\nof traffic against the network.\n\n356\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.250\nThat's on a scale you\ncan't even imagine and\n\n357\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.800\nit can be sustained for\nhours or days sometimes.\n\n358\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.960\nAnd in fact it spawned\na whole new industry now.\n\n359\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.600\nThere are companies like,\nwell, I shouldn't say names.\n\n360\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.564\nBut there are companies out there,\nthat's there entire business is protecting\n\n361\n00:22:30.564 --> 00:22:35.382\nagainst Denial of Service attacks,\nDistributed Denial of Service attacks,\n\n362\n00:22:35.382 --> 00:22:39.397\nand what they'll do is syphon that\ntraffic off to another pipe and\n\n363\n00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:42.340\ndrop it into what we\nwould call a null pot.\n\n364\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.600\nSo it doesn't actually go anywhere,\nit stops traversing the internet.\n\n365\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.697\nThat takes very specialized software and\n\n366\n00:22:48.697 --> 00:22:52.240\nhardware, then you have to do it very\nquickly because if the Distributed Denial\n\n367\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.300\nof Service attack were to overwhelm the\nnetwork before they go ahold of it they\n\n368\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.378\nwouldn't be able to shut it down anymore.\n\n369\n00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:02.880\nSo it's created a whole new industry\nof companies who do nothing but\n\n370\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.970\nprotect large organizations\nfrom those kinds of attacks.\n\n371\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.710\nSmaller companies are really much more,\nor even I don't want to say\n\n372\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.860\njust smaller companies, but companies that\ndon't have the wherewithal to deploy those\n\n373\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.400\nkinds of solutions are actually\nstill at fairly high risk for\n\n374\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.160\nthose kinds of attacks because it\nwill eliminate defense against it.\n\n375\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.210\nThey just have to wait it out.\n\n376\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:30.590\nGroups like Anonymous, groups like Lowzak,\nhacker, bad hacker groups like that.\n\n377\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:35.570\nThey'll use Distributed Denial of\nService attacks quite often to overwhelm\n\n378\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.340\na network.\n\n379\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.520\nAnd maybe that gives them the opportunity\nthen to sneak in the back door and\n\n380\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.790\ntake over the website and deface it.\n\n381\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.760\nAnd do whatever else it is they want.\n\n382\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.430\n>> Are smaller companies, and\nI guess even larger companies as well,\n\n383\n00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.590\nare they able to leverage\nthings like cloud services.\n\n384\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.620\nI know at Amazon they do load balancing,\nAzure does load balancing.\n\n385\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.311\nWhere I can say, if my network starts to\nincrease traffic, because when we talk\n\n386\n00:23:57.311 --> 00:24:00.454\nabout Denial of Service attacks\nSometimes they're intentional,\n\n387\n00:24:00.454 --> 00:24:02.619\nsometimes they're unintentional, right?\n\n388\n00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:06.724\nWe think of the Academy Awards a couple\nof years ago, Ellen did a Tweet and\n\n389\n00:24:06.724 --> 00:24:10.449\njust brought Twitter down, or\nwas it Instagram, one of the two.\n\n390\n00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:13.499\nBrought it down to its knees because\neverybody was trying to get on to see it.\n\n391\n00:24:13.499 --> 00:24:17.897\nAnd it was basically a distributed denial\nof service attack because everybody was\n\n392\n00:24:17.897 --> 00:24:20.510\njust trying to get on to\nthat social media site and\n\n393\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.650\nsee this picture that she had taken.\n\n394\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:23.790\nIt wasn't intentional.\n\n395\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.710\n>> Completely unintentional.\n\n396\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.090\n>> But they can use load balancers to say\nif I've reached a certain level, I want\n\n397\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:32.210\nyou to automatically spin up x number\nof servers to try to balance that out,\n\n398\n00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.220\nto mitigate that, right?\n\n399\n00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.960\n>> Well, the problem is, yeah, you may\nnot have a contract that allows that.\n\n400\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.200\n>> That's true, you might not, but this\nis why we're talking about these things.\n\n401\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.770\n>> Yeah, they have the ability to do that.\n\n402\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.850\nAnd so, one of the things that\nthe auditor needs to do is to\n\n403\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.000\nask those kinds of questions.\n\n404\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.630\nWhat are your plans, or\n\n405\n00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:54.570\ndo you have any plans to protect against\ndistributed denial of service attacks?\n\n406\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.560\nBanks, for instance, that's a very,\nvery pertinent question.\n\n407\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.630\nWhen I go in and ask, and they really\nshould have a good answer for that.\n\n408\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.910\nThey should have some\nkind of plan in place.\n\n409\n00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.058\nIncluding one of the things that they\ncan do because a denial of a service\n\n410\n00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:15.460\nattack could include,\nwhen we say denial, we assume\n\n411\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.080\nthat somebody else is trying to deny it,\nbut a denial of service, in effect,\n\n412\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.920\ncould be something as simple as someone\nin the parking lot cuts a fiber cable.\n\n413\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.770\nAnd now you can't get to\n\n414\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.440\nyour cloud-based bank provider any\nlonger to do your transactions.\n\n415\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.970\nYou need to be able to roll those back and\ndo them on paper.\n\n416\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.110\nUntil maybe one, or two, or\nthree days, whatever it takes in order\n\n417\n00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.510\nfor the cable company to fix that stuff.\n\n418\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.490\nThen we talk a little bit about\nthat in DR, because of continuity-\n\n419\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.180\n>> Mm, I was gonna say,\n\n420\n00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.570\nthere's our DR plan coming into effect.\n\n421\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.998\n>> Yeah, DR business continuity, so\n\n422\n00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:50.625\nyou've got other machines in other\nlocations that you can go to.\n\n423\n00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:54.665\nMost banks will use one or two of their\nbranches as backups, for instance.\n\n424\n00:25:54.665 --> 00:25:58.428\nHospitals usually have multiple\nclinics that they can use for back up,\n\n425\n00:25:58.428 --> 00:25:59.565\nthat kinds of stuff.\n\n426\n00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:04.119\nSo, then next, I wanna talk a little\nbit about phishing, and in particular,\n\n427\n00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:06.950\nsomething that's come up\nin the news recently.\n\n428\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.800\nIt's not on the exam, but\nit's an important aspect of that.\n\n429\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.390\nAnd that's ransom ware.\n\n430\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:20.920\nI don't know if any of you have had any\nexperiences with this, but recently, yeah.\n\n431\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.240\nSo, what ransom ware typically does,\nis it comes in through a phishing attack.\n\n432\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.756\nAnd these are terms you\nneed to know as well.\n\n433\n00:26:26.756 --> 00:26:33.509\nPhishing attack being, sss, somebody sends\nyou an email and hopes you bite the hook.\n\n434\n00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:38.241\nAnd that hook will deliver a Trojan which\nhas a piece of software that goes in and\n\n435\n00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:41.396\nall of a sudden starts\nencrypting your hard drive and\n\n436\n00:26:41.396 --> 00:26:43.349\nall your data on the hard drive.\n\n437\n00:26:43.349 --> 00:26:46.883\nAnd then sends you a little message and\nsays, boink, and pops up and\n\n438\n00:26:46.883 --> 00:26:51.037\nsays you can't access anything on this\ncomputer anymore, if you want it back,\n\n439\n00:26:51.037 --> 00:26:55.272\nyou need to call this number or send me x\nnumber of dollars in bitcoins [CROSSTALK].\n\n440\n00:26:55.272 --> 00:26:56.944\n>> I was gonna say, bit coins,\nthat's what they want.\n\n441\n00:26:56.944 --> 00:26:58.592\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n442\n00:26:58.592 --> 00:27:03.051\nWell, I've actually seen them ask for\ncredit card transactions before.\n\n443\n00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:03.667\n>> Wow.\n\n444\n00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:06.040\n>> Yeah,\nthey're really getting brazen about it.\n\n445\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.500\nAnd that can cripple, small companies\ndon't know what to do about that.\n\n446\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.380\nI mean, we refer them to the FBI\nbecause the FBI is tracking\n\n447\n00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.450\nall that stuff worldwide.\n\n448\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.530\nBut oftentimes, and I'm not suggesting,\n\n449\n00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.100\nI do not wanna be quoted as suggesting\nthat anyone ever pay ransom.\n\n450\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.850\nBut some companies have chosen to do it,\nsimply because they don't have the time\n\n451\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.940\nto mess with it and all the backups\nto be able to recover from it.\n\n452\n00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.680\nOne of the really important\nthings about BCP and\n\n453\n00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.440\nDR is this is where you\nhave to be really careful.\n\n454\n00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.950\nIf that malware gets on a backup tape and\n\n455\n00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.390\nstarts encrypting your backups,\nyou're done.\n\n456\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.580\nYou've got no recourse.\n\n457\n00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.543\nYou are out of business.\n\n458\n00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:53.440\nSo when you go in and you're talking to\nyour clients, you have to be really clear\n\n459\n00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.710\nthat they understand the dangers of\nransomware, and their BCPNDR, those\n\n460\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.950\nplanes all of a sudden become absolutely\ncritical to keeping that business running.\n\n461\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.250\nIt's no different than an IED dropped\nin the middle of the building.\n\n462\n00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.616\nIt will blow things completely up and\nthey will be out of business.\n\n463\n00:28:08.616 --> 00:28:11.853\nSo it's really important that you\nunderstand how to protect against\n\n464\n00:28:11.853 --> 00:28:12.479\nthat stuff.\n\n465\n00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.540\nThe other two I wanna just mention\nreal quickly are drive by's and APT's.\n\n466\n00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.920\nDrive by's are things like,\nand this is happening more and\n\n467\n00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.830\nmore in your mobile devices,\nyou get a little pop up ad\n\n468\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.075\non your mobile device that says hey,\nhave you looked at this?\n\n469\n00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:29.590\nWow, that looks pretty cool,\nand you click on it,\n\n470\n00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:33.170\nnext thing you know,\nyou've been infected with something.\n\n471\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.680\nNot so much on mobile devices today,\n\n472\n00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.170\nbut I see the danger lurking with\nthe pop ups that come up today.\n\n473\n00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.650\nEven, I read my USA Today app, and\n\n474\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.770\noftentimes when I click on a story, that's\nthe first that happens is an add pops up.\n\n475\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.760\nAnd I'm like, at some point hackers are\ngonna start taking advantage of this and\n\n476\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.080\nthey're gonna get into our systems and\ncause some problems.\n\n477\n00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.140\nThe other one I want you to\nunderstand the nature of are APTs,\n\n478\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.660\nor Advanced Persistent Threats.\n\n479\n00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.210\nThat might be on the exam.\n\n480\n00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.790\nI don't think it will be, but\nyou need to know what an APT is anyway,\n\n481\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.710\nyou'll hear that term.\n\n482\n00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:15.330\nIt's called an Advanced Persistent Threat\nbecause what happens is, it's designed to\n\n483\n00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:21.500\ngo into stealth mode and you can\nscan your system and never find it.\n\n484\n00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.528\nYou can find it, clean it, reboot, and\n\n485\n00:29:25.528 --> 00:29:33.242\nit will come right back because it has\nthe ability to hide itself outside the.\n\n486\n00:29:33.242 --> 00:29:37.378\nIf those of you who don't remember this,\nmaybe you haven't had A plus classes, or\n\n487\n00:29:37.378 --> 00:29:38.677\nsomething like that, but\n\n488\n00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:43.300\nthere's something on your hard drive\ncalled the master file table or MFT.\n\n489\n00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.730\nThat's where all of the file locations\non your hard drive are recorded so\n\n490\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.820\nthat your operating system can\nfind them when you need it,\n\n491\n00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.605\nwhen you double-click on a file,\nit goes to the MFT, says,\n\n492\n00:29:52.605 --> 00:29:55.790\nwhere's that file located, it goes\nout on your hard drive and finds it.\n\n493\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.950\nAPTs store themselves\nout on the file table\n\n494\n00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.560\nwithout reporting that back to the MFT.\n\n495\n00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.978\nSo, you can scan your system and\ngo, I cleaned that up.\n\n496\n00:30:04.978 --> 00:30:05.860\nNo, no you didn't.\n\n497\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.948\nIt's still there on your hard drive and\nyou reboot and it's still there and\n\n498\n00:30:08.948 --> 00:30:09.720\nit re-infects.\n\n499\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.770\nThey also have the ability\nto go completely silent.\n\n500\n00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.340\nSometimes for months and then, boop,\n\n501\n00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.170\nthey'll wake up on a given date and\ndo some more damage.\n\n502\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:22.750\nVery difficult to deal with, all the more\nreason that the IT department needs to\n\n503\n00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.540\nbe very vigilant in their scanning,\ntheir routine scanning patching.\n\n504\n00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.920\nMost of the time these\nvulnerabilities cannot be\n\n505\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.240\nleveraged if the systems\nare properly patched.\n\n506\n00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.400\nThat's one of the things that\nI keep pounding in clients,\n\n507\n00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:43.170\nis that if you have a good patching, and\nwe talked some about this yesterday.\n\n508\n00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.640\nIf you have a good patching process,\nchances are,\n\n509\n00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.820\nyou've reduced the risk of these kinds\nof things happening dramatically.\n\n510\n00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.710\nCuz most of them take advantage of\nvulnerabilities that have been around for,\n\n511\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.170\nsometimes years.\n\n512\n00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.820\nBecause they know people are lazy and\nwon't update their systems.\n\n513\n00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.060\nSo one of the ways to beat them at their\nown game is to keep your system up\n\n514\n00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:02.630\nto date.\n\n515\n00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.905\n>> No patch for human laziness, right?\n\n516\n00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:06.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it's really funny they might think\n\n517\n00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.390\nI'm crazy about it, but the first thing I\ndo every morning when I get on my laptop\n\n518\n00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.590\nor phone when I wake up in\nthe morning is I'll look for updates.\n\n519\n00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.050\n>> Yep\n>> I mean, I just do.\n\n520\n00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.292\nEvery machine I touch, it's the very\nfirst thing I do before I do any work.\n\n521\n00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:20.810\n>> Doing these two things,\npatches and updates.\n\n522\n00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:25.570\nAnd making sure quality anti-virus\nsystems are updating, running,\n\n523\n00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.700\nscanning, all working on every\nsystem in my environment.\n\n524\n00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.721\nThat's been the bulk of my work for\nthe last 10 years.\n\n525\n00:31:32.721 --> 00:31:33.278\n>> Right.\n\n526\n00:31:33.278 --> 00:31:36.991\n>> Just doing those things,\nmaking sure because cleaning up viruses,\n\n527\n00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:38.600\ncuz like we said-\n>> Expensive.\n\n528\n00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.650\n>> Our users are going to\nclick on that click bait,\n\n529\n00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.880\nthey're gonna go to that fishing site,\nthey're gonna download that game,\n\n530\n00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.180\nthat attachment on their email,\nand they're gonna get infected.\n\n531\n00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.308\nAnd we have to help try to keep\nthat down to a minimum, and\n\n532\n00:31:51.308 --> 00:31:55.119\nthen remediate when things do go wrong,\nwhen they do those things.\n\n533\n00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:57.834\nSo it's just something we\nhave to be aware of and if,\n\n534\n00:31:57.834 --> 00:32:00.940\nIf the IT department doesn't\nknow that that's there job.\n\n535\n00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.420\nThen us an auditor we need\nto be informing them ASAP.\n\n536\n00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.470\nOtherwise they're gonna hit\nsome of that ransomware,\n\n537\n00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:09.200\nand like we said that\ncan be the end of it.\n\n538\n00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.600\n>> Right, right because again we go back\nto the whole purpose of domain five is\n\n539\n00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.780\nprotecting information assets.\n\n540\n00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.590\nBut in addition to that\nin the bigger picture,\n\n541\n00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.440\nI've stressed throughout the course,\n\n542\n00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.670\nthat what we're really trying to do is\nto manage risk for the organization.\n\n543\n00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:29.710\nNow if the powers at be decide that they\ndon't want to spend the money on this,\n\n544\n00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.184\nthey're willing to take the risks.\n\n545\n00:32:31.184 --> 00:32:34.790\nThen they have to deal with the fallout\nfrom that, you can't change that.\n\n546\n00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.820\nBut as an auditor, our job is to ask them,\nwhat is your level of tolerance for\n\n547\n00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.140\nthis kinds of stuff, are you aware?\n\n548\n00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.490\nOften times the management, if you're\nan extra acting as an external auditor,\n\n549\n00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.930\noften times the management\nis not aware of this.\n\n550\n00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.590\nThey don't know that ransomware\nis rampant right now,\n\n551\n00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.640\nbecause they're busy running\ntheir business everyday.\n\n552\n00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.451\nIt's our job to stay up to\nspeed on that stuff and\n\n553\n00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:59.810\nto alert them to those kind of problems.\n\n554\n00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.570\nSo the last couple things I wanna talk\nabout, I do want to mention that.\n\n555\n00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.040\nOf those attacks,\nsome are what we call active attacks and\n\n556\n00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.970\nsome are passive attacks.\n\n557\n00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.126\nI want you to know the difference between\nthose, you can get that in the book.\n\n558\n00:33:14.126 --> 00:33:18.851\nThen I wanna talk real quickly,\nbecause we've gotta wrap things up here,\n\n559\n00:33:18.851 --> 00:33:21.626\nabout a captchas, C-A-P-T-C-H-A.\n\n560\n00:33:21.626 --> 00:33:25.001\nKnow what a captcha is, the captchas,\nthose look things on a website\n\n561\n00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:28.271\nthat put the weird looking characters and\nthe lines through them.\n\n562\n00:33:28.271 --> 00:33:29.971\nYou can barely read them,\n\n563\n00:33:29.971 --> 00:33:35.317\nthat's to stop robot activity from the web\nthat's what those are designed to do.\n\n564\n00:33:35.317 --> 00:33:36.890\n>> Proves you're a human.\n\n565\n00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.560\n>> Its suppose to, and\nyou have to know it for the exam but\n\n566\n00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.060\nthe reality is captchas are not\nreally very effective anymore.\n\n567\n00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.840\nHackers have found ways\naround them years ago.\n\n568\n00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.500\nBut we still use and in the ISOCA world,\nthey're an effective deterrent.\n\n569\n00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.785\nAnd then the last thing\nI wanna talk about,\n\n570\n00:33:55.785 --> 00:34:00.400\nis in terms of protecting\nagainst these kinds of things.\n\n571\n00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.690\nRemember we talked earlier,\nat the beginning of the session,\n\n572\n00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:08.730\nabout identification, and authorization.\n\n573\n00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.560\nAnd there's something we call\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n574\n00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.054\nyou'll oftentimes hear it called\ntwo-factor authentication.\n\n575\n00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:19.914\nI brought a little,\ncan we zoom in on that?\n\n576\n00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:22.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, from the sky cam.\n\n577\n00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.040\nCan she zoom in on that?\n\n578\n00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.030\n>> I don't know.\n\n579\n00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.550\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.960\n>> Well I'll show it to the camera,\n\n581\n00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.720\nmaybe you can see it.\n\n582\n00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.540\nThis is an RSA token,\nthis is a device we use so\n\n583\n00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:39.310\nthat when you require a higher level of\nsecurity to access a certain resource.\n\n584\n00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.600\nYou put in a username, and\npassword, and this number.\n\n585\n00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.410\nYou can't see it on the screen there,\nit's too small for that.\n\n586\n00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:49.930\nBut, this is what we would\ncall a second factor,\n\n587\n00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:52.789\nso you have to put in your username,\nand password, and this.\n\n588\n00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.460\nAnother way to do that is if I can\nborrow Daniel's phone for a second.\n\n589\n00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.410\nOften times, especially for instance at\nmy bank, I would put in my username and\n\n590\n00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.730\npassword and\nthen it would send me a secure code.\n\n591\n00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.150\nSome or most of you probably\nuse this in one form or\n\n592\n00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.800\nanother with, in particular banking.\n\n593\n00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.900\nIt's used in the US today,\nwhere it would send me a secure code and\n\n594\n00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.730\nthen I'd have to put that code in.\n\n595\n00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.620\nThat's again multi-factor authentication.\n\n596\n00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.900\nBecause it's saying okay well me what your\nusername and password is first Brian.\n\n597\n00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.270\nOkay, now just to be sure you're Brian,\n\n598\n00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:32.200\nI'm going to send a message to your phone\nthat you recorded when you set this up.\n\n599\n00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.000\nSo that you'd have to not only\nknow my username and password,\n\n600\n00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.790\nyou'd also have to steal my phone.\n\n601\n00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.110\nGet past my thumbprint identification and\n\n602\n00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.170\nopen up my app to see that code\nin order to get into the bank.\n\n603\n00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.580\nThat adds another layer in what we\nwould call in the security world,\n\n604\n00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.764\na layered security, or\na multi-layered defense.\n\n605\n00:35:52.764 --> 00:35:55.950\nIn-depth system for\nprotecting those assets.\n\n606\n00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:56.640\n>> Yeah, what do they say?\n\n607\n00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.070\nIt's something you have,\nsomething you know, and something you are.\n\n608\n00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.890\n>> Right.\n>> So any of those three things,\n\n609\n00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.620\nyou put them together, and\nhere's your multi factor.\n\n610\n00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.260\n>> Right, and the other one,\nI wanted to demonstrate, but\n\n611\n00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.610\nI don't have one,\nis what we call a smart card.\n\n612\n00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:17.620\nSmart cards typically looks not too\nmuch unlike a credit card with,\n\n613\n00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:23.030\nyou notice the new credit cards with\nthe little metal chip in it, right there.\n\n614\n00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.810\nThat's what a smart card looks like,\nexcept you put in into your system, and\n\n615\n00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.070\nit stores information on\nthat in an encrypted format.\n\n616\n00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.142\nAnd that acts as your second\nform of authentication.\n\n617\n00:36:33.142 --> 00:36:38.335\nI'm gonna talk a little bit in the next\nepisode about the trusted platform module,\n\n618\n00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:41.250\ncuz I can see we're out of time already.\n\n619\n00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.660\nBut that's an important piece you'll\nneed to know for the exam as well,\n\n620\n00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.210\nthere will be questions on TPMs.\n\n621\n00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.550\n>> All right Brian, well we definitely\nlook forward to hearing that.\n\n622\n00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.990\nThis has been an excellent episode.\n\n623\n00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.980\nI love security stuff,\n\n624\n00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.370\nso I'm all atither when we started\ntalking about those types of subjects.\n\n625\n00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.980\nDon't forget to grab a copy of\nthe CISA Study Guide 4th Edition.\n\n626\n00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.770\nThat is one of the authors\nright here giving you lowdown\n\n627\n00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.270\non what's inside of there,\nright here right now.\n\n628\n00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.440\nThat being said, looks like we've come\nto end of yet another great episode,\n\n629\n00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.830\nhopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n630\n00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.200\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n631\n00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.950\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n632\n00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.370\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n633\n00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.409\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n634\n00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:27.510\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.420\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.240\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.040\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis one of the authors of the CISA study\n\n6\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.570\nguide that we've been using, the fourth\nedition, is our good friend, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.320\nBrian O'Hara.\n\n8\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780\nBrian, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.500\nHow's it going, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.690\n>> Good morning, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.710\nIt's going well, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.010\nIn the last episode we talked\nabout things like, let's see.\n\n13\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.825\nI have to look at my notes again, don't I?\n\n14\n00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We talked about\n\n15\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.410\nin we're talking about domain five,\nwhich is protecting information assets.\n\n16\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.030\nIn the last episode,\nwe talked about malware, apt's,\n\n17\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.050\nwe also talked about biometrics,\nauthentication mechanisms etc.\n\n18\n00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.490\nWe still haven't talked\nabout authorization.\n\n19\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.403\nBut we talked about\nauthentication methods etcetera.\n\n20\n00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:08.751\n>> One of the things I'd like to go into\na little bit more detail than is really\n\n21\n00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:09.898\nnecessary for the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:15.118\nBut is good knowledge to understand\nin this episode is we're gonna talk\n\n23\n00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:20.523\nabout security testing techniques,\nsoftware, methodologies, etc.\n\n24\n00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:23.146\nAnd I'd like to start off with ensuring,\nand\n\n25\n00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:27.565\nI think I mentioned in the last episode,\nwe're gonna do sort of a deep dive in\n\n26\n00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:31.041\na few sessions on the open\nsystems in our connection model.\n\n27\n00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:35.695\nSo that we make sure that everybody has\na very clear understanding of how network\n\n28\n00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.230\ncommunications happen.\n\n29\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.860\nSo in this piece,\nwe're gonna talk a little about how to\n\n30\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.180\ntest those applications,\nthe network devices, etc.\n\n31\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.490\nEverything that runs all of\nthe software and hardware,\n\n32\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.228\nall the systems that we're talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:59.670\nWe wanna be able to adequately\ntest those environments\n\n34\n00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.685\nto make sure that they're working properly\nfrom a communications standpoint.\n\n35\n00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:11.040\n[COUGH] The, one of the key words I try\nto teach students, is reconnaissance.\n\n36\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.060\nWhen I go into, a environment for\n\n37\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.040\nthe first time,\nI wanna start looking at the network,\n\n38\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.660\nin terms of understanding its\narchitectural design and layout.\n\n39\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.690\nVLANs, routing, etc., etc.\n\n40\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.220\nEven with adequate Visio drawings or\nPDFs of Visio drawings, etc.,\n\n41\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.750\nthat can be a rather complex and\ntime consuming effort.\n\n42\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.690\nSo I learned years ago to use\na little tool called NMAP.\n\n43\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.370\nI'm gonna bring it up on the screen here.\n\n44\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.560\nMegan, if you could bring\nmy screen up live for us.\n\n45\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.659\nThere you go.\n\n46\n00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.040\nLet me see if I can scroll\nthat in a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.670\nOops wrong one.\n\n48\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.131\nThere we go.\n\n49\n00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:57.900\nWe'll scroll that over there, yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.780\nIt's at www.nmap.org, you can see that I\nbelieve up in the upper left hand corner,\n\n51\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.480\nthat's the site.\n\n52\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.300\nThis is a piece of software that's\nbeen around for well over a decade.\n\n53\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.947\nThe gentleman who developed\nit's name is Fydor.\n\n54\n00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.470\nThat's F-Y-D-O-R.\n\n55\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.070\nThat's his handle, if you will.\n\n56\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.920\nVery smart gentleman.\n\n57\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.340\nHas developed it where now,\nyou can see there at the top,\n\n58\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.700\nwe're version 7.12 Like I said, I've\nbeen using this for at least a decade.\n\n59\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.670\nI'm not gonna do a network scan for\nyou, but\n\n60\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.110\nI just wanna talk a little bit about\nwhat the tool is designed to do.\n\n61\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.240\nThis is not a penetration testing tool.\n\n62\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.560\nThis is purely a scanning and\nreconnaissance tool.\n\n63\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.090\nSo I use it to find out\nwhat's on the network,\n\n64\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.160\nnot what the IT people have\ntold me is on the network.\n\n65\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.069\nSo more often than not,\nwhen I perform my reconnaissance\n\n66\n00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.650\nscan, Or discovery, if you will.\n\n67\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.130\nThat's really what we're talking about,\nis doing discovery.\n\n68\n00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.908\nI will find things that\nthey don't know about.\n\n69\n00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:13.314\nIn our session on interconnection modeling\nthe OSI model, we'll talk about ports and\n\n70\n00:04:13.314 --> 00:04:19.297\nabout what kinds of applications that\ntells us are running on the network, etc.\n\n71\n00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:21.900\nWe'll get in a little more\ndetail on that later.\n\n72\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.000\nBut suffice to say,\nthat NMAP is used typically\n\n73\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.450\nto simply discover the hosts\non a network that are running.\n\n74\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.709\nOf course if the host is turned off,\nit's not going to discover it,\n\n75\n00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:39.878\nbut it will find things like\nwireless access points.\n\n76\n00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:44.126\nIt will find things like servers that\nyour may have forgotten exist and\n\n77\n00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:46.214\nwhen we talk about ports later on,\n\n78\n00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:50.160\nI'll give you a couple examples\nof recent NMAP scans I did.\n\n79\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.480\nWhere it discovered services running\non systems that the operations and\n\n80\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.530\nIT department did not know, they couldn't\nexplain why they were running on those.\n\n81\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.560\nSo, it's a great utility,\nyou have to be very careful with it.\n\n82\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.070\nIt typically will not\ncrash any type of system,\n\n83\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.600\nthis is a very low level\nnetwork scanning tool.\n\n84\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.130\nIt's basically making just a pure,\nsimple TCP connections,\n\n85\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.820\nwe'll talk about that the three way\nhandshake and stuff in another session.\n\n86\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.350\nSo very low level.\n\n87\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.790\nI don't know of a system ever being\nbrought down because of an NMAP scan, but\n\n88\n00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.270\nyou still have to be careful with it.\n\n89\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.170\nYou have to ask permission.\n\n90\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.400\nYou don't ever wanna scan\na network without permission.\n\n91\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.230\nAnd you wanna talk to the network people\nbefore you do anything like this.\n\n92\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.330\nThey may even wanna do it for you.\n\n93\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.840\nI would not suggest that you take this\ntool and just fire it up and go use it.\n\n94\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.770\nYou need to spend some time learning it or\nat least read about it so\n\n95\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.690\nthat when someone hands you\nthe results of a NMAP scan\n\n96\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.100\nyou know what it is that they\nare talking about, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.680\nSo it is purely a discovery tool,\nthat's all.\n\n98\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.600\nThe only time i've ever seen it\ndo anything haywire is the great\n\n99\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.260\nlittle side bar.\n\n100\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.260\nI've got to tell the story, I was\nworking with a company and the IT guy\n\n101\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.790\nforgot to tell me the IP address\nto exclude for their mainframe.\n\n102\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.950\nMainframes by their nature will log every\n\n103\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.330\nTCP connection attempt,\nthat's why they're such a secure system.\n\n104\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.320\nThey log all of those connections so\nthat if anyone ever wants to know,\n\n105\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.990\nthere's a full audit trail.\n\n106\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.624\nWhen I do a TCP scan on an IP address,\n\n107\n00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:35.562\nI scan 65,000 ports, so\nwhen I scan the mainframe,\n\n108\n00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:40.740\nit logged 65,000 port connections.\n\n109\n00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.534\nOne right after the other one, so\nthe terminal where they were watching\n\n110\n00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:47.570\nthe logins when [SOUND]\n>> It went haywire on them.\n\n111\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.699\n>> Lit up like a Christmas\ntree which is a type of scam.\n\n112\n00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> That was not my mistake.\n\n113\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.490\nThat was the IT guy's mistake for\nnot telling me to exclude that IP but\n\n114\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.540\nthere was no damage done.\n\n115\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.078\nAll it did was really chew up a bunch\nof my port connections temporarily and\n\n116\n00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:10.188\nfill their log up with 65,000\nlog entries very easily fixed.\n\n117\n00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:13.874\nAnyway, it's a great scanning tool,\nI would encourage all of you to become\n\n118\n00:07:13.874 --> 00:07:17.800\nfamiliar with it, if you like playing\naround with it, install on your machine.\n\n119\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.489\nThere's a Mac version,\nthere's a Linux version, and there's, for\n\n120\n00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:25.260\nalmost all the Linux distributions and\nthere's a Windows version.\n\n121\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.410\n>> They also have a Solaris, if I'm not\nmistaken, and other UNIX type variance.\n\n122\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.880\n>> I don't know if they\nkeep those up anymore.\n\n123\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.030\n>> They might not, yeah, but\nthere is a Solaris copy.\n\n124\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.990\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n125\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.810\n>> If you're running that [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you even know what that is.\n\n126\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.478\nSo the next thing I wanna move on\nto is the first in what we would\n\n127\n00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:54.165\ncall a vulnerability scanning tool the\nmost commonly known tool is called Nasas.\n\n128\n00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:57.598\nActually, let me see if I can\nget there screen up here.\n\n129\n00:07:57.598 --> 00:07:59.528\nThere we go Nasas, click.\n\n130\n00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:00.809\nI thought I had that on the website.\n\n131\n00:08:00.809 --> 00:08:01.743\nThere you go.\n\n132\n00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:02.475\nThere's Nessus.\n\n133\n00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:05.680\nI don't sell Nessus, so\nI'm not trying to get you to buy this.\n\n134\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.150\nI don't make any money if you did, etc.\n\n135\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.900\nThere's lots of different versions.\n\n136\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.720\nI just want you to know who Tenable is.\n\n137\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.240\nThere are a number of other\nproducts out there and\n\n138\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.890\nI'm not endorsing Nessus\nover any of the others.\n\n139\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.479\nThe reason I talk about Nessus is because\n\n140\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.885\nyou can still get what's called\na home feed version for free.\n\n141\n00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:28.130\nNessus was developed under the open source\n\n142\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.850\nlicensing model a number of years ago,\nwell over a decade ago.\n\n143\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.520\nAnd as a result of that,\nTenable has taken the product and\n\n144\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.100\nput their support model and added some\nstuff to it, and so they charge for that.\n\n145\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.750\nBut the actual core application\nthey're not allowed to charge for\n\n146\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.760\nbecause it's still held under\nthe open source licensing.\n\n147\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.060\nSo you can actually get a copy of this for\nfree.\n\n148\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.900\nPut it on your Linux box, your Mac box.\n\n149\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.860\nI have a copy running on my Mac box.\n\n150\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.520\nThere's even a Nessus client for\nthe iPhone that you can run where you can\n\n151\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.020\nconnect to a remote server and\ntell it what to do in terms of scanning.\n\n152\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.080\nWhat Nessus is designed to do is to\nperform what we call vulnerability scans.\n\n153\n00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.054\nIt's important you\nunderstand the difference.\n\n154\n00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.720\nNmap is a discovery tool.\n\n155\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.160\nIt does port scans what\nwe call port scans.\n\n156\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.420\nAnd it will do discovery work, but it's\nnot designed to tell you somethings wrong.\n\n157\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.780\nIt can, there are scripts and\n\n158\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.830\nif you get really good at it you can\nuse it to find all kinds of problems.\n\n159\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.720\nBut that's not what it was designed to do.\n\n160\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.290\nIt is a discovery tool, excuse me,\nthis is a vulnerability assessment tool.\n\n161\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.520\nIt's an official vulnerability assessment.\n\n162\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.450\nI want to talk a little bit about, because\nthis is important, what the difference\n\n163\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.570\nbetween a vulnerability assessment and\na penetration test is.\n\n164\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:57.620\nA vulnerability assessment is kind\nof like going to the doctor and\n\n165\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.000\nhe or she draws blood and\nthey run 70 tests on you.\n\n166\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.980\nPSA, see if you're pregnant,\nwhatever, all kinds of weird stuff.\n\n167\n00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.230\nThey look at everything and\n\n168\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.332\nthey try to do an assessment of\nwhat might be wrong with you.\n\n169\n00:10:11.332 --> 00:10:14.930\nThat's what Nessus is designed to do,\n\n170\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.310\nis to design to scan\nmultiple operating systems.\n\n171\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.230\nLinux, UNIX, Windows,\nyou name it it can scan it.\n\n172\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.820\nAnd it can look for things like do you\n\n173\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.910\nhave vulnerabilities that put you at\nrisk against PCI compliance standards?\n\n174\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:37.020\nDo you have vulnerabilities that put\nyou at risk against APT threats?\n\n175\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.950\nOr denial of service threats?\n\n176\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.630\nOr for instance,\nare you missing a patch on Flash?\n\n177\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:50.800\nAre you running a version of Oracle's\nJava, that's vulnerable to attack etc.\n\n178\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.870\nIt's a vulnerability assessment tool.\n\n179\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.240\nThe way these sort of fit\ntogether in the real world is\n\n180\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.070\nNessus even runs Nmap under the hood.\n\n181\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.480\nWhen Nessus performs an initial scan,\n\n182\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.800\nit uses the Nmap engine to actually\ngo out and do host discovery first.\n\n183\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.570\nThen it begins crunching through its\nsoftware to actually start looking for\n\n184\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.860\nthe vulnerabilities.\n\n185\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.860\nThat's why I wanted to show you both of\nthose products cuz Nessus actually uses,\n\n186\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.290\nit has Nmap built into it.\n\n187\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.530\nSo this is very different\nthan penetration.\n\n188\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.330\nWe're not at the level where we're talking\nabout doing penetration testing yet.\n\n189\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.308\nThe vulnerability assessment\ndiscovery is important, so\n\n190\n00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:38.290\nyou know if there are things on your\nnetwork that you're not aware of.\n\n191\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.220\nNumber two, in terms of both devices and\nservices number two are those devices and\n\n192\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.330\nservices suffering from vulnerabilities\nyou aren't aware of and\n\n193\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.520\nif they are can you remediate those.\n\n194\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.750\nAnd then we'll get into talking\nabout the actually penetration test.\n\n195\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.280\nNow I always recommend to clients\nthat they do their discovery work and\n\n196\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.680\ntheir vulnerability scans long before they\ntalk about having a penetration test.\n\n197\n00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:07.940\nAnybody have an idea why?\n\n198\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.310\nDaniel?\n>> Because if you don't know what\n\n199\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.540\nyou're looking to exploit,\nthen how can you do a test?\n\n200\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.620\n>> Well, not only that, but\nhere's the real big difference.\n\n201\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:21.350\nA penetration test is designed with\none goal in mind: to get inside.\n\n202\n00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.890\n>> Capture the flag.\n\n203\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:28.070\n>> It doesn't care if there are 73\nother ways to do it, it doesn't care.\n\n204\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.260\nIt found a way in.\n\n205\n00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.030\nSo it doesn't tell you about the other\n73 that it could have gotten in it,\n\n206\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.180\nbut I don't care.\n\n207\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.280\nI got in this way, I accomplished my goal.\n\n208\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.390\nYou could have 100 more vulnerabilities,\nand\n\n209\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.600\n100 more paths that I can\nattack you in and still get in.\n\n210\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.640\nBut I found one, and\nthat's game over at that point.\n\n211\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.750\nSo it's really important to understand\nthat, doing your vulnerability assessments\n\n212\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:55.890\non a regular, routine basis helps\nprepare you for your penetration test.\n\n213\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.410\n>> So would you say that\nthe vulnerability assessments are really.\n\n214\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.320\nWith vulnerability assessment,\n\n215\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.240\nI'm trying to find every which\nway I could possibly gain access.\n\n216\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.400\nAnd then the pen test\nis me actually trying\n\n217\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.710\nto gain access through those avenues.\n\n218\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.460\n>> That's correct.\n\n219\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.770\nHere's another good example.\n\n220\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.859\nThis is one I've used in classes before.\n\n221\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.180\nA vulnerability assessment, or excuse me.\n\n222\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.420\nLet's start off with Nmap, the discovery.\n\n223\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.240\nSo let's take the example of a house.\n\n224\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.840\nAn Nmap scan would be the same as\nme walking around the perimeter\n\n225\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.620\nof a house and looking at it.\n\n226\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:38.560\nAnd I found a backdoor that's closed and\n\n227\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.050\nmaybe locked, but\nit has a cheap lock on it.\n\n228\n00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.730\nIt doesn't have a dead bolt,\njust has a cheap lock.\n\n229\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.500\nThat's my discovery.\n\n230\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:52.500\nMy vulnerability assessment is to look\neven closer and go, I can break that lock.\n\n231\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.570\nThat's a vulnerability,\nI need report that to somebody.\n\n232\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.070\nOkay.\n\n233\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.470\nWhat I may not know is, and\nI take the vulnerability assessment to\n\n234\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.440\nthe stage is that there's nothing\non the other side of the door.\n\n235\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.080\nIt's a brick wall.\n\n236\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.890\nSo who cares if it's got a cheap lock,\nright?\n\n237\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.250\nYou ignore it and go on.\n\n238\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.870\nSo the vulnerability assessment is\ndesigned to look a little bit deeper than\n\n239\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.390\njust this walk around the house.\n\n240\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.320\nGoes we got a door there with a bad lock.\n\n241\n00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.750\nMaybe we ought to take a look at that\na little closer, jiggle the lock to see.\n\n242\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.480\nMaybe we'll find something on\nthe other side, maybe we won't.\n\n243\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.400\nIf we do,\nwe do find something on the other side.\n\n244\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.858\nMaybe we ought to go to the store and\nbuy a dead bolt.\n\n245\n00:14:32.858 --> 00:14:34.160\nMaybe we ought to put a deadbolt on that\n\n246\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.890\ndoor became there is\nsomething of value behind it.\n\n247\n00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.708\nOr, maybe it is just the place\nwhere you put your muddy boots,\n\n248\n00:14:39.708 --> 00:14:42.530\nthere's nothing there so who cares,\nleave it unlocked, no big deal.\n\n249\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.400\nOkay?\n\n250\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.050\nYou don't think it's a big deal.\n\n251\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.490\nThat's your vulnerability assessment.\n\n252\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.110\n>> Or even worse that, we don't use\nthat door ever, and yet it's there and\n\n253\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.820\nmaybe even open.\n\n254\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.840\n>> So, now we've done our\nvulnerability assessment,\n\n255\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.010\nwe've plugged up most of\nthe holes we know about.\n\n256\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.450\nNow comes the penetration test.\n\n257\n00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.200\nOkay.\n\n258\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.060\nThe penetration testers, and\nI'm gonna come back to the black box,\n\n259\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.510\ngreen box thing in a minute.\n\n260\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.419\nI want to stick with the house thing for\na second.\n\n261\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.180\nThe penetration test is where\nthe bad guy comes around and\n\n262\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.045\njiggles the handle on the locks,\n\n263\n00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:24.810\nlooks around to see if there's dogs,\nis there lights on, is the TV on,.\n\n264\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.850\nThey're doing really, really,\nreally, quiet stealthy probing and\n\n265\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.950\ndiscovery to find out things.\n\n266\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.650\nAnd they find out that well yeah,\nmaybe you have locks on all the doors and\n\n267\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.390\nyou went and bought that dead bolt.\n\n268\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.100\nThat plugged that vulnerability up,\nbut guess what?\n\n269\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.190\nYou missed a basement window\nthat was left unlatched.\n\n270\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.325\nIt has a lock on it, but\nsomebody left it unlatched and\n\n271\n00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:49.985\n[SOUND] they sneak in the door and\naway they go.\n\n272\n00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:54.315\nNow, you could have six of those\nwindows that are unlatched, but\n\n273\n00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:56.215\nthey only went through one.\n\n274\n00:15:56.215 --> 00:16:00.083\nSo you come home and you find out that\nthey broke in and the police say, well,\n\n275\n00:16:00.083 --> 00:16:02.030\nlatch that window, and you latch it.\n\n276\n00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.185\nYou still don't know about the other five,\ndo you?\n\n277\n00:16:04.185 --> 00:16:04.774\n>> Nope.\n\n278\n00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:07.300\n>> Okay, that's part of what your\nvulnerability assessment was.\n\n279\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.580\nSo you go back and\nyou do another vulnerability assessment.\n\n280\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.960\nNow you look harder at your windows, and\nyou realize we have five of them open.\n\n281\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.630\nSo you go and latch all of those.\n\n282\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.830\nSo you begin to see how the three\nof those begin to work together.\n\n283\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:24.040\nYour discovery scans, your vulnerability\nassessment, and your penetration test.\n\n284\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.730\nOkay?\n\n285\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.220\nThat's how they work in unison\nrather than in individual silos\n\n286\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.910\nto help tighten up the security and the\nrisk management of the organization, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.710\nSo I wanna show you this product.\n\n288\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.660\nIt's called Kali.\n\n289\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.350\nKali is a Linux distribution.\n\n290\n00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.270\nIt's built on the Debian platform.\n\n291\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:52.920\nAnd, it is both a blessing and a curse.\n\n292\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.820\nI say a blessing because it\nallows companies to very quickly,\n\n293\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.620\neasily, and it's free,\nbecause it's open source, very quickly and\n\n294\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.489\neasily to deploy penetration\ntesting tools in their environment.\n\n295\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.940\nThe bad news is,\nit allows bad guys to get the best\n\n296\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.390\nhacking tools in the world to\nuse against your environment.\n\n297\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.200\n>> Hack in a box.\n\n298\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.670\n>> That's right, hack in a box.\n\n299\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.600\nSo you download and\ninstall this Linux image and\n\n300\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.590\nyou have a complete, and I mean complete.\n\n301\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:29.310\nThere are literally hundreds and\nhundreds of discovery tools.\n\n302\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.130\nVulnerability assessment tools.\n\n303\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.700\nYou can break passwords.\n\n304\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.630\nYou can scan wireless networks.\n\n305\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.730\nYou can do man-in-the middle attacks.\n\n306\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.010\nIf you can think about it,\nit is already built in there.\n\n307\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.180\nVery very very robust platform.\n\n308\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.050\nAlso, very dangerous in\nthe hands of the wrong people.\n\n309\n00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.560\nSo, why do we talk about all this?\n\n310\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.960\nBecause again, we're trying to\nmanage risk for the organization.\n\n311\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.895\nWe're trying to protect\nIT information assets and\n\n312\n00:17:57.895 --> 00:18:04.130\ndoing proper, routine,\nand regular discovery\n\n313\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.500\nvulnerability scanning and\npenetration testing is an important and\n\n314\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.210\neffective piece in the battle\nagainst the bad guys.\n\n315\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.730\nThat's the only way you can keep on top\nof the changing landscape of software and\n\n316\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.810\nhardware, and routers and firewalls, and\nintrusion detection systems, et cetera.\n\n317\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.510\nThere's so many places,\n\n318\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.030\nyou know the old saying is we have\nto be right 100% of the time.\n\n319\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.960\nThe bad guy only has to be right once and\n\n320\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.460\nthey will get inside and own you and\nchew you up and destroy you.\n\n321\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.460\nSo, one last tool I wanna\ntalk about a little bit that\n\n322\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.390\nis kind of in the same arena I mentioned\nin one of our previous episodes.\n\n323\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.930\nAlso it's called\na Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n324\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.950\nThis is a little bit different than\na vulnerability assessment tool, but\n\n325\n00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.580\nit really is.\n\n326\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.050\nThat's why it's called\na baseline security analyzer.\n\n327\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.320\nLet me see, how can I describe this?\n\n328\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.590\nGenerally this is used\ninside your network.\n\n329\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.420\nSometimes I'll run into workstations but\n\n330\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.180\ngenerally I ask the network administrators\nto run these on their servers and\n\n331\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.540\nin particular on SQL servers and\nExchange servers.\n\n332\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.760\nThis tool is free, it's from Microsoft.\n\n333\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.460\nActually all the stuff I just showed you\nis free, the MBSA is not open source.\n\n334\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.040\nIt's Microsoft but it is free and I do\nnot believe that they have updated for\n\n335\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.760\nWindows 10 yet but I suspect it does\n\n336\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.590\nsupport Windows 8.1 it probably\nwould work adequately on Windows 10.\n\n337\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.540\nBut there'll be some new features I'm\nsure that there will be 2.4 version\n\n338\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.790\nout at some point here soon\nthat will cover Windows 10.\n\n339\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:56.001\nIn addition,\nI believe SQL 2016 is probably due out.\n\n340\n00:19:56.001 --> 00:20:01.098\nAnd I know Server 2016, I'm not sure\nif it's out or due out any time now.\n\n341\n00:20:01.098 --> 00:20:02.980\nThey'll have to add support for\nthat, as well.\n\n342\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.270\n>> Yeah, it's really close.\n\n343\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.460\nI can't remember if it's\nactually hit the market.\n\n344\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.440\nOr if it's still like a technical preview.\n\n345\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.080\n>> Right.\n\n346\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.430\n>> But yeah, yeah, you wanna be\nable to stay on the bleeding edge.\n\n347\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.931\nIf you're putting these newer systems\nin your environment, should I say,\n\n348\n00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:18.840\nyou wanna be able to check them.\n\n349\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.610\nWe wanna look for those vulnerabilities.\n\n350\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.681\nWe need to assess them and\nmake sure, well,\n\n351\n00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.970\nyou know what, I was I didn't\nrealize I had this port open.\n\n352\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.510\nWhy am I running an FTP\nserver on my Windows 10 box?\n\n353\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.270\nWhy is that happening?\n\n354\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.050\nWell, I installed some software and it\nhad a little FTP server built into it and\n\n355\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.220\nnow I've got that port open.\n\n356\n00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.930\nHow would I know that?\n\n357\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.380\nWell, we've gotta assess it, we have to\nrun it through the wringer and say hey,\n\n358\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.980\ndo you have any problems?\n\n359\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.160\nAnd using things like NMap and Nessus and\nthe MBSA is a really good tool,\n\n360\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.990\nand they're not really that they\ncan get complex to use, but\n\n361\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.480\nto use them out of the gate\nis really not that difficult.\n\n362\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.700\n>> Right.\n>> Like Brian,\n\n363\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.320\nI've used all these tools for\nquite some time now, and\n\n364\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.350\njust doing at least some preliminary\nscanning with each one of them?\n\n365\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.460\nVery simplistic and\nit's very easy to digest and\n\n366\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.840\nconsume as data for you, the end-user,\nto find out where might I be vulnerable?\n\n367\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.100\nSo it is a good thing to do,\nlearn how to use these tools.\n\n368\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.089\n>> And the vendors provide great\ndetailed tutorials if you want to learn,\n\n369\n00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:19.190\nif you wanna get good\nat doing them in depth.\n\n370\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.970\nI've got to the point any more where I\nactually have PowerShell scripts that\n\n371\n00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.670\nare in with the NBSA so\n\n372\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:28.270\nthat when I show up, I typically know more\nabout how to run NBSA than the admins do.\n\n373\n00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.690\nBut excuse me, one of the things I wanna\npoint out about NBSA, or a couple things.\n\n374\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.430\nOne is, number one,\nit does not run on Linux or Macs.\n\n375\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.959\nIt will only run on Windows.\n\n376\n00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140\nSo that's one downside.\n\n377\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.240\nThe other products we talked about so\nfar will run on either Linux, or\n\n378\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.290\nMacs, or PC's.\n\n379\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.650\nAnd number two is that,\nwhat was number two, I forget.\n\n380\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.750\n[LAUGH] Anyway,\n\n381\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.780\nwhat it's designed to do is\nto scan Microsoft systems.\n\n382\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:07.750\nNot Linux systems, not Macs, but\nit's designed to scan Microsoft systems\n\n383\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:13.014\nfor a couple of things that\nother scanners may miss.\n\n384\n00:22:13.014 --> 00:22:15.150\nAnd Nessus is one of those and\n\n385\n00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.720\nI'll talk a little bit about there's\ntwo different ways to scan a system.\n\n386\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.620\nFrom the outside, from the inside.\n\n387\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.840\nWhat MBSA really excels at\ndoing that Nessus can do but\n\n388\n00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.330\nit's fairly complex is it will look for\n\n389\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.000\ninstances of SQL databases\nrunning on your systems.\n\n390\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.470\nAnd it will tell you whether or not those\ninstances are patched correctly, or\n\n391\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.050\nif the SA password or\nthe super user account.\n\n392\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:50.040\nIf you don't know, Microsoft SQL servers,\neach instance of a server\n\n393\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.230\nhas what's called an SA or a supervisory\nadministrator account or super user.\n\n394\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.130\nWe would typically call it\nan administrator account.\n\n395\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.980\nOftentimes those instances are installed\nand the assay password is left blank.\n\n396\n00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.410\nIf that password is blank, that means\nanyone can take a copy of that database,\n\n397\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.300\nwhether it's encrypted or\nnot, and view the contents.\n\n398\n00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.800\nSo it'll tell you if those\nassay passwords are blank.\n\n399\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.780\nIt'll tell you whether or\nnot you have too many.\n\n400\n00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:23.260\nToo many administrator accounts\non a specific machine.\n\n401\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.920\nMicrosoft recommends no more\nthan two more administrator\n\n402\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.760\naccounts on any given machine.\n\n403\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.220\nIt'll tell you if there's more than that.\n\n404\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.550\nIt scans a whole lots of things,\n\n405\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:36.430\nit catches things that Microsoft\nproducts like WSUS will miss sometimes.\n\n406\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:41.541\nIn particular Visual C++ updates for\nsome weird reason, I don't know,\n\n407\n00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:47.230\nshow up in there when there's a Visual C+\n2010 patch that WSUS always misses.\n\n408\n00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.230\n>> I think it's the actual\nlibraries that some of them have\n\n409\n00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.540\nvulnerabilities inside of them.\n\n410\n00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.150\n>> Correct.\n>> So if you're using an older version and\n\n411\n00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.990\nyou could be vulnerable.\n\n412\n00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.498\n>> Right, right.\nAnd\n\n413\n00:23:56.498 --> 00:23:58.967\nit's very easy to download the patches and\nfix it.\n\n414\n00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:02.929\nBut typically, products like\nWSUS miss some of that stuff.\n\n415\n00:24:02.929 --> 00:24:07.972\nSo again, it's a free tool, it's pretty\nsimple and straightforward to use.\n\n416\n00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:11.824\nIt can get a little more complicated if\nyou're trying to scan across a network or\n\n417\n00:24:11.824 --> 00:24:15.792\nif you're doing it across active directory\ndomains or if you're in a large active\n\n418\n00:24:15.792 --> 00:24:19.143\ndirectory forest with multiple domains,\nit can get a little hairy.\n\n419\n00:24:19.143 --> 00:24:23.360\nYou just kind of have to know how to use,\nhow to insert Admin user names and\n\n420\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.730\npasswords.\n\n421\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:30.514\nSo we still got a few minutes left but\nthat's pretty much what I wanted to,\n\n422\n00:24:30.514 --> 00:24:33.730\nwait a minute, that's what it\nwas I was thinking, I'm sorry.\n\n423\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.410\nThere was one more piece I\nwanted to talk about that\n\n424\n00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.610\nthere are three types of penetration\ntests that I want you to know about.\n\n425\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.220\nI do not think these\nwill be on the exam but\n\n426\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.430\nI want you to know the terms anyway and\nhave heard them.\n\n427\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.790\nAnd they are black box,\n\n428\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.430\ngray box, and white box, okay?\n\n429\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.550\nBlack box penetration testing means\nthat I would hire Daniel here to\n\n430\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.410\ndo a penetration test on my company.\n\n431\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.310\nAnd I give him absolutely no information.\n\n432\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.880\nI just go, here's a check, come and\nsee me by the third of the month.\n\n433\n00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.310\n>> I'm coming at it like a true hacker.\n\n434\n00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.720\n>> Tell me whether you're\nable to do anything or not.\n\n435\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.690\n>> No giving away any of it.\n\n436\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.310\n>> That's right.\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n437\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:21.510\nA gray box penetration test is one where\nwe will share a little bit of information.\n\n438\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.160\nI'll give him the name of my company,\nI'll give him my website,\n\n439\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.310\nI may even say here's the IP range\nof the IP addresses that I own.\n\n440\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.700\nThat makes things happen\na little bit faster.\n\n441\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.120\nIn a white box test,\nI'm gonna share all the information.\n\n442\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.070\nI'm gonna say, here are the 12\nIP addresses I want you to scan.\n\n443\n00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:48.570\nWe have web servers running on them\nprimarily or SQL servers, et cetera.\n\n444\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.760\nAnd I want you to have them attacked and\n\n445\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.360\nyou're not allowed to bring our\nservices down at any point.\n\n446\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.620\nYou think that if you hit the enter key,\nyou're going to destroy service, stop and\n\n447\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.380\ncontact us and let us know,\nthings like that.\n\n448\n00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.960\nSo those are the different kinds.\n\n449\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.516\nAnd then, the other piece I almost forgot\nin the vulnerability assessment was,\n\n450\n00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:11.201\nagain, this is not on the test,\nthis is just for your knowledge so\n\n451\n00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:15.566\nthat you sound like a really smart auditor\nwhen you go and do your audit stuff.\n\n452\n00:26:15.566 --> 00:26:21.673\nAnd that is there are both what we call\ncredentialed and non-credentialed scans.\n\n453\n00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:25.489\nSo I mentioned earlier,\nthere are two ways to look at a system,\n\n454\n00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:28.050\nfrom the outside coming in, okay?\n\n455\n00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.410\nSo Daniel's the hacker and\nhe's coming at my system and\n\n456\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.560\nall he sees are the exposed ports.\n\n457\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.090\nOn the inside, if I have credentials,\n\n458\n00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.370\nI can actually log into the system and\nI can read the registry,\n\n459\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.300\nI can find out a lot more about\nthe system than just its exposed ports.\n\n460\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.645\nA credential vulnerability scan will\ngive me immensely more information than\n\n461\n00:26:52.645 --> 00:26:55.912\na non-credential but\nit can also be rather overwhelming.\n\n462\n00:26:55.912 --> 00:26:58.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So typically because of the breadth of\n\n463\n00:26:58.702 --> 00:27:00.998\nthe information-\n>> It's like it came from a fire hose.\n\n464\n00:27:00.998 --> 00:27:05.845\n>> Right, so typically what I do is I\nrecommend that you only do credentialed\n\n465\n00:27:05.845 --> 00:27:09.908\nscans against either a subset of hosts or\nmaybe a few servers so\n\n466\n00:27:09.908 --> 00:27:14.594\nyou kind of begin to get the feel for\nare our systems really in bad shape or\n\n467\n00:27:14.594 --> 00:27:19.674\nthis is going to give us a little bit more\ninformation that we need to know, and\n\n468\n00:27:19.674 --> 00:27:24.755\nagain a credentialed scan is not something\na hacker would see necessarily but\n\n469\n00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:30.165\nit's good to know for instance that your,\nlet's see what's one I can think of.\n\n470\n00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:35.120\nI don't know that maybe you've\ncreated a custom registry key,\n\n471\n00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.990\nsome SSL VPN products for instance will,\n\n472\n00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.360\nthe company will create\na special registry key so\n\n473\n00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.820\nthat that machine can be identified\nwhen it tries to connect over VPN.\n\n474\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.080\nThey'll scan the registry when you log\nin and before they give you access,\n\n475\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.560\nif they don't find that registry entry,\nthey will deny you access.\n\n476\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.710\nWell if I know that as a hacker now\nbecause I've done a credential scan,\n\n477\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.510\nI can copy that registry key,\nput it on a machine, bing,\n\n478\n00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.190\nI can get access to your network.\n\n479\n00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.880\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n480\n00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.000\nBrian, we do have a quick question\ncoming from our chat room.\n\n481\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.490\nThey're asking what about\napps like SCM and EMET, eNet?\n\n482\n00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.780\nAre you familiar with these devices?\n\n483\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.090\n>> I'm not sure what SCM is,\nI know what EMET is.\n\n484\n00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:22.600\nAnd EMET is a Microsoft product of\nEnhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit and\n\n485\n00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.630\nthe reason I didn't mention EMET really\nis because EMET is beginning to go away.\n\n486\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.710\nFor those of you who don't know,\nEMET is actually built into Windows 10.\n\n487\n00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:37.030\nThat's part of what is built\ninto the Edge browser.\n\n488\n00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.620\nEMET was a way of protecting\nWindows 7 systems from some\n\n489\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:48.770\nworkarounds against things\nlike memory randomization,\n\n490\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.625\nheap stock overflows,\ncertain kind of attacks like that.\n\n491\n00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:55.630\nEMET is still around but\nyou won't see it in Windows 10.\n\n492\n00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:01.280\nThey are going to probably sunset it here\npretty soon because Internet Explorer\n\n493\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.240\n11 is set to die and when it dies,\nthere won't be a need for EMET any longer.\n\n494\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.350\nAnd actually if you look at Malwarebytes,\nif you go out and\n\n495\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.610\nlook at a copy of Malwarebytes,\nSecurity Compliance Manager.\n\n496\n00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.100\nYeah.\nSecurity Compliance Manager,\n\n497\n00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.790\nI don't have any experience with it,\nparticularly the new version 3.0.\n\n498\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.720\nI think it's a good tool but\nI don't have any experience with that.\n\n499\n00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.470\nBut what I was saying about EMET was,\nMalwarebytes has\n\n500\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.510\na free utility that you can download, you\ncan also upgrade and buy the version, but\n\n501\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:37.550\nit basically does the same thing as EMET,\nit's just a commercial version of it, so.\n\n502\n00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.070\n>> All right.\n\n503\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.340\n>> So that's it for this episode.\n\n504\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.540\nI want to make sure everybody knows those\nterms, pen testing, vulnerability testing,\n\n505\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.610\nscanning, black box, white box, gray box,\n\n506\n00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.990\nthat you understand the difference between\ncredentialed and uncredentialed scanning.\n\n507\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.250\nAnd please play around a little bit with\nthose tools, get familiar with them.\n\n508\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.870\nBe very careful,\nthey're very dangerous tools,\n\n509\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.920\nyou can completely destroy\na network with or with.\n\n510\n00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.550\nSo please be very careful, read the FAQs,\n\n511\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.020\ndo a little research,\ntake a look at the library.\n\n512\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.180\nI think the ITProTV library,\nwe've been looking at, or\n\n513\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:21.340\ntalking about developing some of those\ncourses for those specific applications.\n\n514\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.460\nSo keep your eyes peeled for\nthat, and you may find more.\n\n515\n00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.280\n>> All right, Brian.\n\n516\n00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.040\nWell we do thank you for explaining\nsome of these security practices and\n\n517\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.410\nthe tools that we can use to help keep\nour systems out of the weeds, right?\n\n518\n00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.655\nThat's where we don't wanna be.\n\n519\n00:30:34.655 --> 00:30:37.435\nWe have to assess their\nvulnerability status and\n\n520\n00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:39.614\nthen are we able to even exploit them?\n\n521\n00:30:39.614 --> 00:30:41.407\nIf we can use these tools effectively,\n\n522\n00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:43.810\nyou will know whether or\nnot that you have a problem.\n\n523\n00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.770\nSo definitely like Brian said, take his\nadvice, learn how to use them, learn how\n\n524\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.760\nto efficiently use them, and don't play\naround with other people's systems.\n\n525\n00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.520\nBuild yourself a pen testing,\n\n526\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.280\na testing area to get familiar with them\nbecause it can get you even in a little\n\n527\n00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.490\nbit of legal trouble if you start\nknocking on the wrong door.\n\n528\n00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.840\nThat being said, don't forget to buy\na copy of the CISA Study Guide, fourth\n\n529\n00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.910\nedition, as Brian is one of the authors\nof that, they're a great study guide.\n\n530\n00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.670\nIt will help you immensely.\n\n531\n00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.730\nAnd it looks like we've run\nout of time for this episode.\n\n532\n00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.170\nWe thank you, Brian, for stopping by.\n\n533\n00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.695\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n534\n00:31:16.695 --> 00:31:18.950\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTv.\n\n535\n00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.474\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n536\n00:31:20.474 --> 00:31:21.774\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n537\n00:31:21.774 --> 00:31:24.273\n>> We'll see you next

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.230\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.920\nseries On the C-I-S-A, that's\nthe certified information systems auditor.\n\n5\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.150\nI'm always going to to get that wrong,\nI'm horrible with acronyms.\n\n6\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.030\nBut guess what, this little lovely\nstudy guide here, the fourth edition,\n\n7\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.940\nwe have one of the authors with me right\nhere in the studio to help guide us down\n\n8\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.380\nthis path that we might become\nC-I-S-A certified auditors as well.\n\n9\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.890\nAnd his name is Bryan O'Hara.\n\n10\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.640\nBryan welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.590\nSo glad to have you and\nhow is it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.120\n>> Thank you Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.170\nIt's going well.\n\n14\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.330\nThank you for having me again.\n\n15\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.820\nThis is going to be one of our in\ndepth episodes I want to talk about\n\n16\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.300\nthe open systems that\nare connection model.\n\n17\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.490\nYou'll find a large chunk of\nthis material in the book and\n\n18\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.030\nyou'll notice that it's in\nthe ISACA study materials.\n\n19\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.427\nThe reason is that it's really fundamental\nthat anyone who is involved in IT audit.\n\n20\n00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:17.190\nThis particular domain,\nwe're talking protecting IT assets,\n\n21\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.830\nunderstands how communication occur\nbetween systems because systems as they\n\n22\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.790\nstand alone really don't serve really\nmuch use anymore, it's the ability for\n\n23\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.850\nthem to communicate amongst themselves.\n\n24\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.150\nSo we're gonna talk a lot this session\nabout how that communication takes\n\n25\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.110\nplace, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.260\nI'm gonna bring a picture up on the screen\nthat I'm gonna leave up on the screen\n\n27\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.200\nprobably most of the rest of the session.\n\n28\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.380\nLet me see if I can,\nI guess I can't make it any bigger.\n\n29\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.224\nOops, shouldn't have done that.\n\n30\n00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:55.730\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Assume function, or\n>> Yeah let me fix this there.\n\n31\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.165\nI can make it a little\nbit bigger that way.\n\n32\n00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.090\n[INAUDIBLE] down.\n\n33\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.410\nGive me just a second folks to get this,\n\n34\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620\nI wanna make it big enough that\neverybody can see it adequately.\n\n35\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.510\nOops, come on, don't, there we go.\n\n36\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.260\nThere, that looks pretty good,\nI think everybody can see that.\n\n37\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.440\nSo what we're gonna talk about\ntoday are the seven layers of\n\n38\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.750\nwhat's called the open system\ninterconnection model, or OSI.\n\n39\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.679\nWe're not gonna say open system\ninterconnections anymore, I promise.\n\n40\n00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:21.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.100\n>> The OSI model is just that.\n\n42\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.820\nThis is a model, this is a framework for\n\n43\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.040\nexplaining how communication\nshould take place.\n\n44\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.150\nIt involves a set of what\nwe would call protocols.\n\n45\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.020\nAnd from my old days of teaching, the best\nanalogy I can give to this is that I've\n\n46\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.370\nalways found it absolutely amazing\nthat I could go into a Walmart\n\n47\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.740\nin any city in the United States,\nbuy a $12 toaster,\n\n48\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.950\nput it in a suitcase, fly to China,\npull that toaster out,\n\n49\n00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.370\nplug it in the wall, and\nit will toast a piece of bread.\n\n50\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.360\nWhen you think about it,\nthat is pretty amazing.\n\n51\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.660\nThe reason that we're able to do\nthat is what we call protocols.\n\n52\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.450\nWe have protocols that we've established\nwith how power should be generated,\n\n53\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.510\ndistributed, etc.\n\n54\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.620\nAnd while there are different protocols\nin different parts of the world,\n\n55\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.380\nthere's some place in Europe that still\nuses 220, they use different plugs, but\n\n56\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.295\nmost of the world has adopted the U.S.\nstandard of 110, 120 volts.\n\n57\n00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:34.890\n60 hertz, ect., ect., ect., so\nthat you can buy almost any appliance,\n\n58\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.030\na hair-dryer, or a electric razor, and\n\n59\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.030\nplug it in almost anywhere\nin the world and it'll work.\n\n60\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.920\nI mean,\ndon't you think that's pretty amazing?\n\n61\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680\n>> And when you think about it\nthis is fact that we're a bunch of\n\n62\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.050\ndifferent people doing the exact same\nthing in different parts of the world,\n\n63\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.230\nbecause you typically see-\nIf I pose the question.\n\n64\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.820\nI said if I wanted to\nturn bread into toast.\n\n65\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.510\nHow would you do it?\n\n66\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.730\nWell you might sit back and develop\na method of creating bread into toast.\n\n67\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.250\nBut it might not be\nthe same way that Brian.\n\n68\n00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.080\n>> Right.\n>> Creates bread into toast.\n\n69\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.640\nHow do we make it to where everybody\nmakes toast in the same way.\n\n70\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.240\nAnd that's kind of\n\n71\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.250\nwhat we're talking about when it\ncomes to network connectivity.\n\n72\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.030\nRight?\n\n73\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.649\n>> Exactly.\nExactly.\n\n74\n00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.060\n>> So, another good example is water.\n\n75\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.240\nHow our water systems work.\n\n76\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.770\nYou filter the water,\nit's distributed out through pipes, etc.\n\n77\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.940\nWe develop protocols for doing this\nkind of stuff all over the world.\n\n78\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.820\nSo that's what began to\n\n79\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.740\nhappen back in the early mid 70s and\nearly 80s as we began\n\n80\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.970\ndeveloping computer systems that we wanted\nto be able to communicate with each\n\n81\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.350\nother across vast distances, particularly\nbetween colleges and universities.\n\n82\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.060\nIn the early days, there was the DARPA\nnetwork, or ARPA network, excuse me.\n\n83\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.220\nAnd we used all different\nkinds of protocols.\n\n84\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.690\nAnother example I always like\nto use is back in the 1800s,\n\n85\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.300\nback before the turn of the centuries,\nrailroads were not standardized,\n\n86\n00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.000\nand every railroad company used\na different width for railroad tracks.\n\n87\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.550\nWhich made it difficult for trains to\ninterconnect and use the same rails, which\n\n88\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.940\nmeant that every time you built a railroad\nyou had to build your own set of tracks,\n\n89\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.550\nwhich was hugely expensive\neven in those days.\n\n90\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.470\nAnd so finally someone wised up and\n\n91\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.030\nthought, if we build them\nall exactly the same way.\n\n92\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.290\nWe can compete with each\nother on the same tracks.\n\n93\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.130\nSo they standardized railroad tracks,\nand since that time, we've been able to\n\n94\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.925\nrun railroad cars on any\ntrack in the country.\n\n95\n00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:43.935\nI'm not exactly sure in Europe,\nwhether they use the same standard,\n\n96\n00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.115\ncuz I've never been there.\n\n97\n00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.325\nWhether they use the same standard\nas they do in the US, but\n\n98\n00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:50.475\nat least all the trains in\nEurope use the same standard.\n\n99\n00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:56.000\nSo that you could go from\nGermany to Switzerland to Spain,\n\n100\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.900\netc., without having to stop and get off.\n\n101\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.170\nOne company's train and\n\n102\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.950\nget on another company's train,\nthey all run on the same tracks.\n\n103\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.610\nThe same idea applies to the OSI model.\n\n104\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.740\nIt took us a number of years, I remember\nwhen I worked for a company that does\n\n105\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.920\nnot even exist anymore, it used to be\ncalled General Telephone, today it is\n\n106\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.170\ncalled Verizon, but back in those\ndays it was called General Telephone.\n\n107\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.060\nWe use something called a three\ncom network that ran over a big,\n\n108\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.520\nfat, round, heavy, thick coax cable.\n\n109\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.760\nEthernet had not even been\ninvented at that point.\n\n110\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.060\nNo one had even come up with the idea.\n\n111\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.020\nIt was still in the lab I guess.\n\n112\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.410\nAnd so, three com networks couldn't\ncommunicate with other kinds of networks.\n\n113\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.600\nHP had some network stuff and IDA had\nsome network stuff, token ring, etc.\n\n114\n00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.570\nIt was really confusing, so there hadn't\nbeen a standard system developed.\n\n115\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.820\nAnd quite honestly there wasn't a need for\nit.\n\n116\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.780\nSo if you worked in an office building,\nas long as all the computers in that\n\n117\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.620\noffice building could talk to each other,\nthat's really all that mattered.\n\n118\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.130\nIt didn't really matter that\nmuch whether you could talk to\n\n119\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.500\nsome company up the street, because\nthe internet hadn't been invented yet.\n\n120\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.774\n[LAUGH] So as the internet started to come\n\n121\n00:07:11.774 --> 00:07:20.410\nalive with Tim Berner's,\nI'm blanking at his full name.\n\n122\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.570\nTim Lee Berners,\nwho invented the world wide web.\n\n123\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.890\nIt became clear that we needed to have\nsome kinds of standardized protocol and\n\n124\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.220\nwe settled on TCP/IP.\n\n125\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.310\nTransmission protocol, internet protocol,\n\n126\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.040\nstandard suite of protocols in order for\nus to communicate.\n\n127\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.190\nSo the OSI model is one model.\n\n128\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.620\nThere are actually two or three others.\n\n129\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.749\nThe Department of Defense model\nactually only has four layers.\n\n130\n00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:51.762\nInstead of seven, like the OSI model, but\n\n131\n00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:56.714\nfor the ISACA exam, you need to know\nthe seven layers of the OSI model.\n\n132\n00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:59.804\nYou're gonna need to memorize\nthe names of these in order.\n\n133\n00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:02.250\nThis is one of those memorization\nthings you have to get.\n\n134\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.620\nThat's why I wanna leave it up on\nthe screen during the entire session, so\n\n135\n00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.790\nwe have plenty of time for\nyou to kind of burn that in your memory.\n\n136\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.570\nThere are pictures of this in the book\nthat look a little different than this.\n\n137\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.440\nSo today what I wanna do is\ngive you sort of a practical or\n\n138\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.430\npragmatic explanation for what's really\ngoing on In this entire process.\n\n139\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.880\nWhat I'm going to talk about is\nwhat we call encapsulation and\n\n140\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.190\ndecapsulation of data streams.\n\n141\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.540\nSo if you notice here in the middle\nof all these little pieces\n\n142\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.010\non the center of the screen, Daniel made\nthis wonderful little graphic up for me.\n\n143\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.600\nThank you, Daniel.\n\n144\n00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.230\nThat's the actual data that's being\ntransmitted from one machine to another,\n\n145\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.070\nor from one machine to many,\nor from many machines to one.\n\n146\n00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.340\nIt can be any combination of those.\n\n147\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.120\nFor demonstration purposes, we're going to\nbreak it down to a single chunk of data.\n\n148\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.395\nMaybe that's a string of text.\n\n149\n00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:04.170\nDaniel's name or something like that,\nor a picture or something like that.\n\n150\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.700\nThat's the actual data\nthat's gonna go from\n\n151\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.820\nthe sending node to the receiving\nnode if you will in this picture.\n\n152\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:17.010\nAnd what happens is, and the reason we use\nthe layer model to demonstrate this is\n\n153\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.300\nto show to you how we basically\ntake that data piece and\n\n154\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.930\nstart building what we call headers and\n\n155\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:30.430\nfooters on that data piece as\nit goes up and down the OSI.\n\n156\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.710\nWe call it the stack or the IP stack.\n\n157\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.900\nSo you'll notice here, I think you\ncan see my mouse right over here.\n\n158\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.664\nWe're gonna start from the sending node,\n\n159\n00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:42.700\nwhich takes a piece of data\nfrom the application layer.\n\n160\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.890\nSo, in other words,\nDaniel has a picture of his little girl\n\n161\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.280\non his computer and\nhe wants it to send it to me.\n\n162\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.280\nSo, the application might be iPhoto\non his Mac or something like that.\n\n163\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.210\nThat's the application that's going to\nsend the data down the stack to me, and\n\n164\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.350\nacross the medium, and\nthen back up to my machine.\n\n165\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.360\nSo the first thing it has to do\nis it has to take that data and\n\n166\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.960\nit has to encapsulate it to\npass it to the next layer.\n\n167\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.350\nBecause each layer is completely\nignorant of all the others except for\n\n168\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.010\nthe one above it and below it.\n\n169\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.880\nSo the presentation layer right here, for\n\n170\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.970\ninstance, only goes about the application\nlayer and the session layer.\n\n171\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:30.440\nSo it knows how to take what it gets from\nthe application layer, this is done via\n\n172\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.890\nsoftware, it knows how to add it's piece\nand then passes it to the session layer.\n\n173\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.160\nThe session layer has no awareness\nthat the application layer exists, nor\n\n174\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.350\ndoes it care.\n\n175\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.680\nIt only knows that the presentation\nlayer can pass in information.\n\n176\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.530\nIt then adds its header and footer, and\ncan then pass it to the transport layer.\n\n177\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.750\nAnd so on down the stack.\n\n178\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.899\nWhen we get to the session layer,\nwe're talking\n\n179\n00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:04.860\nabout things like, HTTP,\nHTTPS, SSL, TLS, etc.\n\n180\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.600\nExcuse me, SSL and TLS are incorrect,\nI'm sorry that's in layer four.\n\n181\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.570\nBut those are the session layers.\n\n182\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.700\nThen as we go down farther,\nthe encapsulation continues down.\n\n183\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.640\nAt the segment layer,\n\n184\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.510\ndown here at transport, that's where\nthe port numbers are actually applied.\n\n185\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.540\nSo it brings all that data down and\nit says, send this to port 22,\n\n186\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.920\nand then it passes it down\nto the network layer,\n\n187\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.440\nand the network layer says,\nsend it to this IP address.\n\n188\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.690\nSo now, it knows it's a picture.\n\n189\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.370\nIt's sending it over HTTP.\n\n190\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.520\nIt knows what kind of session it's going\nin, it says send it over port, and\n\n191\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.830\nI'm just making it up, port 22, we could\nsay 80, and send it to this IP address.\n\n192\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.430\nOkay, so\nnow it's got all this stuff on there,\n\n193\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.950\nbut it still isn't ready to be put onto\nthe medium that we're going to talk about.\n\n194\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.190\nIt still has another\ncouple of steps to go.\n\n195\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.880\nThe next is the data link layer.\n\n196\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.050\nAnd the data link layer is the last layer,\n\n197\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.980\nthat prepares that information to be\nput onto, or into the physical media.\n\n198\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.420\nAnd I say that because, physical medium,\ndoesn't always mean a wire does it Daniel?\n\n199\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.085\n>> No it does not.\n\n200\n00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:18.772\n>> Physical medium can actually mean-\n>> The air.\n\n201\n00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:20.606\n>> Ether, air, wireless.\n\n202\n00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:21.650\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.460\nThe air or ether is actually a medium\nthat we need to remember and\n\n204\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.110\nso it is a physical medium.\n\n205\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.820\nDon't mistake it.\n\n206\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.080\nThat is layer one stuff, and that can\ntrip you up on an exam question, so\n\n207\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.380\nmake sure understand that.\n\n208\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:40.040\nThe air waves are a physical medium\nthat data can be transmitted across.\n\n209\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.000\nThe data link layer then\nprepares the packet,\n\n210\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.400\nor the data frame as it's called,\nto be put onto the physical layer.\n\n211\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.170\nSo it encapsulates it with its\nfinal headers and footers.\n\n212\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.870\nSo the last layer, the physical layer,\nis where the information\n\n213\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:15.560\nis actually finally turned into usable\ninformation on physical medium.\n\n214\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.910\nAnd by usable information,\nwhat I mean, are bits and bites.\n\n215\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.330\nSo in a traditional wired\nmedium that would mean, and\n\n216\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.630\nthis is important, just so\nyou that know how it actually works.\n\n217\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.650\nBits are signaled across the cable medium,\n\n218\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.720\nzeroes and ones,\nby a lack of pulse and a pulse.\n\n219\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.190\nLack of pulse is zero, pulse is a one.\n\n220\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.230\nSimple as that.\n\n221\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.285\nAnd it starts streaming zeros and ones.\n\n222\n00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:45.925\n[SOUND] A billion or whatever a second.\n\n223\n00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:48.880\nGoes across this physical medium.\n\n224\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.130\nAnd then it starts back up the other side.\n\n225\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.650\nIt finds the node, the physical layer.\n\n226\n00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.510\nAnd we won't get into the whole\nrouting switching mechanism.\n\n227\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.580\nWe'll assume this is on the same network.\n\n228\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.930\nSo it knows what port to\nsend this information to.\n\n229\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:08.115\nIt hits the receiving network interface or\nswitch port network card etc.\n\n230\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:16.020\nAnd the software on the operating system\nnow begins to decapsulate the information.\n\n231\n00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:21.195\nSo what it does is it says this is\na physical this is a physical streams of\n\n232\n00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:25.140\nbits and zeros and ones, I need to strip\noff the header and footer of that and\n\n233\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.440\nget it prepared for the date link layer,\nwhich will expose the Mac address,\n\n234\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.090\nwhich will tell it what port to\nsend it to, etc., on the switch.\n\n235\n00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.590\nSo then it goes up to layer two, strips\nthat information off, again remembering\n\n236\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:43.190\nthat layer two doesn't know anything\nports or the transport layer.\n\n237\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.050\nDoesn't know anything\nabout that it's a JPEG.\n\n238\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.310\nIt just knows,\n\n239\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.650\nI've got this chunk of stuff I\ngotta move up to the network layer.\n\n240\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.340\nSo, I'm gonna peel off, and\nthat will expose the IP address.\n\n241\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.050\nSo, now the network layer has it.\n\n242\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.530\nAnd, again, the network layer\nonly knows about the data link,\n\n243\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.340\nonly knows about the transport.\n\n244\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:05.000\nOnly their adjacent layers do\nthey have any awareness of.\n\n245\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.890\nThe network layer peels\noff the port numbers and\n\n246\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.555\nsays this is a TCP\ntransmission to port 22.\n\n247\n00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:15.415\nSo I'm gonna pass this up\nto the transport layer.\n\n248\n00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.855\nAnd then the transport layer goes on and\non as well.\n\n249\n00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:20.755\nLet's see this is over HTTP.\n\n250\n00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:22.765\nIt's not encrypted, and it's a JPEG.\n\n251\n00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:25.689\nNow we're gonna deliver it\nup to the application layer.\n\n252\n00:15:25.689 --> 00:15:29.450\nAnd bingo,\nmy picture appears on my screen.\n\n253\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.939\nNow-\n>> It's magic.\n\n254\n00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:32.182\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah magic, and\n\n255\n00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:35.980\nwhat's really amazing when you think\nabout it, it really truly is amazing.\n\n256\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.950\nAt my age I can say this cuz I've watched\nthis develop over the last 40 years,\n\n257\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.919\nis that we do this without even thinking\nabout it every day, all day long we're\n\n258\n00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:50.694\nlooking at webpages, we're looking\nat files, we're sending e-mail.\n\n259\n00:15:50.694 --> 00:15:55.068\nAnd every single one of those\nbits of information is being\n\n260\n00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.537\ntransmitted using this model.\n\n261\n00:15:57.537 --> 00:16:01.890\nSo not only do you get the thing\nthat I mentioned about power and\n\n262\n00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:07.130\nbeing able to take a toaster to China and\ncook toast in it and it works.\n\n263\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.070\nBut the same thing is true with this.\n\n264\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.880\nI can send a picture to Daniel\non my local network, but\n\n265\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.450\nI can also send it to someone in China.\n\n266\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.890\nOr South America, and it gets there\nalmost at the speed of light.\n\n267\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.210\nIt gets there completely in one piece.\n\n268\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.157\nThere are verification validation\nmechanisms built into this to\n\n269\n00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:32.033\nensure that if pieces of data are lost\nin transmission they're retransmitted,\n\n270\n00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.563\netc., we don't need to get\ninto all the details of that.\n\n271\n00:16:35.563 --> 00:16:40.420\nBut just suffice it there are mechanisms\njust like there are mechanisms in\n\n272\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.587\nyour home where if the voltage begins to\ndip a little bit, your meter can pick up\n\n273\n00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:51.040\nthe surge and make sure that you have\nenough power to run your washing machine.\n\n274\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.230\nPlus the machines are built to\nwithstand some tolerance of that,\n\n275\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.350\nsame thing with our network stuff and\nit will recover, but I really do.\n\n276\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.380\nI think it' absolutely mind boggling,\nmind boggling,\n\n277\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.310\nthat I can sit at a keyboard like this and\ntalk to my granddaughter\n\n278\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.780\nwho is now 20,\n30 some hours by car away from me.\n\n279\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.540\nAnd we can actually have\na live conversation,\n\n280\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.060\nshe can see a picture of me,\nI can see a picture of her.\n\n281\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.010\nAnd she's growing up in a world today\nwhere kids just assume that that works.\n\n282\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.080\nOf course, it does.\n\n283\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.490\nThey have no concept of\nhow it actually occurs.\n\n284\n00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:33.300\nSo the purpose of this\npresentation is to get\n\n285\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.320\nyou think at the bit level for the first\ntime, when you're going in and looking\n\n286\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.420\nat a network and you're doing those\nnetwork scans, this is what you're doing.\n\n287\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.119\nYour sending data down that stack.\n\n288\n00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:51.460\nRemember I mentioned you can go one\nto many, many to one, or one to one.\n\n289\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.900\nAny combination of those.\n\n290\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.369\nWhen you're doing network scanning,\nyou're doing one to many.\n\n291\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.330\nWhen you're doing vulnerability\nassessments you're looking often times at\n\n292\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.800\nare there problems with this?\n\n293\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.010\nOne of the things I can do with\nan in map scan for instance, is\n\n294\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.170\ndifferent operating systems handle\nthis stack a little bit differently.\n\n295\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.470\nThere are nuances in that, just like,\n\n296\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.560\npower may fluctuate in your home,\nbut your microwave still works.\n\n297\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.690\nWell, different operating systems handle\nthis flow a little bit differently.\n\n298\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.630\nAnd I can actually identify whether that\nis a Linux system, or a Windows system, or\n\n299\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.520\na Mac system, simply by the way\nthe system responds to probes\n\n300\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.490\naround these protocols,\nbecause I now know how they work.\n\n301\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:47.180\nSo it's really a fascinating topic\nI would encourage all of you to\n\n302\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.220\nlearn more about it,\nget very familiar with it.\n\n303\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.712\nYou will have to know those seven layers.\n\n304\n00:18:52.712 --> 00:18:54.670\nI guarantee you this is\ngoing to be on the exam.\n\n305\n00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.030\nThere's no wink wink about it.\n\n306\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.910\nIt will be there.\n\n307\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.810\nCount on it.\n\n308\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.770\nYou must know all seven layers,\n\n309\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.830\nwhat you're gonna see are questions where\nthey mix them up and try to confuse you,\n\n310\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:08.280\nthey may say pick the best,\nbe very careful with this, this is\n\n311\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.230\none of those ones that will trip you up,\nbecause you really need their acronyms,\n\n312\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.060\nI saw some of the folks on Twitter\n>> The mnemonics?\n\n313\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.480\n>> Yeah, the mnemonics,\nif one of those works for\n\n314\n00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.819\nyou that's great, I prefer you just\nsimply know what they all mean.\n\n315\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.310\nBut if you need to memorize them,\n\n316\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.760\ntry using a mnemonics of\nsome kind to memorize them.\n\n317\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.270\nBut be very familiar with them as you\ngo out into the audit world because\n\n318\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.920\njust like you can have applications\nthat are not patched properly or\n\n319\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.160\noperating systems that\nare not patched properly.\n\n320\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.656\nYou can have problems with\nyour telecommunications,\n\n321\n00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:46.470\nwhere things break down inside this model.\n\n322\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.579\nA good example is if your routing\nprotocols are not configured properly,\n\n323\n00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:54.490\nyou can start having delays in\ntransmissions because things have to go\n\n324\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.864\na much longer way to their destination\nthan they would normally if your routing\n\n325\n00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.010\nprotocols are configured properly.\n\n326\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.270\nThat can cause denial\nof service situations.\n\n327\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.410\nThat can cause all kinds\nof other problems.\n\n328\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.630\nYou need to find out whether or\nnot your encryptions are working properly.\n\n329\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.040\nWhen I do a vulnerability\nassessment in web servers, today,\n\n330\n00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.594\nI don't even think HTTP,\nI think HTTP should just be outlawed.\n\n331\n00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:22.160\n>> [LAUGH] Just get rid of it.\n\n332\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.870\n>> Simple as that.\n\n333\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.800\nJust stop using it.\n\n334\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.389\nEverything should be HTTPS,\n\n335\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.470\nwhich is secure HTTP if you didn't\nknow that already over port 443.\n\n336\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.840\nNow, in one of the next episodes I'll\ntalk a little bit more about the ports\n\n337\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.560\nwhich have to do with, I'm not sure if\nI can, let me see if I can do this.\n\n338\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.698\nNo that's an arrow, sorry.\n\n339\n00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:43.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wrong tool.\n\n340\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.580\nWe'll talk more detail about\nlayer three and layer four.\n\n341\n00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.150\nThere's not a whole lot you need to\nworry about in layer two anymore.\n\n342\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.860\nMost of the types of layer\ntwo attacks have been\n\n343\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.740\nfairly well mitigated over the years.\n\n344\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.090\nThere's a couple things you can still do,\nbut it doesn't generally net you anything.\n\n345\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:09.140\nLayer three and\nfour still as you get up in the OSI stack.\n\n346\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:15.069\nThe attacks become more sophisticated,\nbut they can also do a lot more damage,\n\n347\n00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:21.178\nbecause if I can reroute ports, or change\nrouting decisions made in layer three,\n\n348\n00:21:21.178 --> 00:21:26.604\nI can create denial service attacks,\nI can do man in the middle attacks.\n\n349\n00:21:26.604 --> 00:21:32.017\nI can do all kinds of ugly stuff as we go\nup the stack in the application layer,\n\n350\n00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:37.120\nif I can manipulate that with an attack,\nI even have more control.\n\n351\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.922\nSo I'll talk a little bit\nabout how ports work and\n\n352\n00:21:40.922 --> 00:21:45.980\nsome of the ways that we can\nmitigate tax against those.\n\n353\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.560\nBut again, going back to the model, I\nwanna make sure everybody has a very clear\n\n354\n00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.630\nunderstanding of how this data and\nthis time I will draw an arrow.\n\n355\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:59.230\nHow this data goes down the stack,\n\n356\n00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.420\ngoes across the medium and\n\n357\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.630\ngoes back up the stack at the other end,\nand vice versa.\n\n358\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.985\nLet me get a little sea\nsick there from this.\n\n359\n00:22:06.985 --> 00:22:09.870\n>> [LAUGH] And one,\ntoo many martinis over there.\n\n360\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.610\n>> And vice versa I could put a second\narrow at the bottom at the end of each of\n\n361\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.680\nthose but you get the point is,\nthat it's a two-way communication street,\n\n362\n00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.200\nthere's a constant stream of bits and\nbytes back-and-forth in that,\n\n363\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.700\nand I think that's probably where I\nwanna stop today in this episode.\n\n364\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.560\nI know we have a few minutes left but\nI wanna pick up at another spot where we\n\n365\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.170\ntalk about ports and scanning and\nsecurity and stuff like that.\n\n366\n00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.761\n>> Sounds like a good place to stop, and\nif you've never ventured out into this\n\n367\n00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:44.072\nforray of encapsulation and decapsulation,\nit's the technical terms of running up or\n\n368\n00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:48.662\ndown the stacks there, it can be a little\noverwhelming so do take your time,\n\n369\n00:22:48.662 --> 00:22:51.993\nlearn what each one of those layers are,\nwhat they do.\n\n370\n00:22:51.993 --> 00:22:55.851\nAnd that will help you immensely when\nit comes to test taking time and\n\n371\n00:22:55.851 --> 00:23:00.183\nit really will help you a lot in general\nin life because just everybody's got\n\n372\n00:23:00.183 --> 00:23:01.140\na home network.\n\n373\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.570\nEverybody is working\nwith network devices and\n\n374\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:08.310\nunderstanding how these protocols and\nthis system works.\n\n375\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.940\nWe'll help you troubleshoot your\nown problems in your own network.\n\n376\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.550\nSo it can be very helpful\nin general in life.\n\n377\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.590\nThat being said, we do thank you Brian for\nexplaining these things to us.\n\n378\n00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.870\n>> Sure.\n>> We hope you guys have enjoyed it and\n\n379\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.690\nmaybe even learned\na little something today.\n\n380\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.670\nDon't forget to grab\na copy of the Study Guide,\n\n381\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.340\nthe fourth edition as\nI hold it upside down.\n\n382\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.986\n[LAUGH] I love to grab it the wrong way,\nwritten or\n\n383\n00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:33.705\nat least co authored by our good\nfriend here, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n384\n00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:36.489\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n385\n00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:38.338\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n386\n00:23:38.338 --> 00:23:39.455\n>> And

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.684\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.453\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.453 --> 00:00:25.889\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nagain today is the author of\n\n6\n00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:30.440\nour 4th Edition Study Guide for\nthe Certified Information Systems Auditor.\n\n7\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.290\nHere's our good friend, Mr. Brian O'Hara.\n\n8\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.150\nBrian, welcome back to the show,\nand how's it going today sir?\n\n9\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.370\n>> It's going well Daniel,\nthank you for having me back again.\n\n10\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.550\nIn our previous episode, I introduced\nthe concept of the 7 layers of the OSI,\n\n11\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.120\nor Open Systems Interconnection Model, and\n\n12\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.940\nhow data flows from one\nnode to another in terms of\n\n13\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050\nhow the encapsulation/de-capsulation\nprocess works.\n\n14\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.600\nIt's important for the CISA Auditor\nto have a good understanding of those\n\n15\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.800\nprocesses and the layers, so that when\ntroubleshooting begins to occur, that they\n\n16\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.990\nhave some idea and understanding of what\nand where things might be going wrong.\n\n17\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.470\nSo, in this episode we're going to\ntake it yet another layer deep.\n\n18\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390\nI told you in the previous episodes I\nwas gonna take a deep dive today into\n\n19\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.770\nboth the OSI model and encryption.\n\n20\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.160\nAnd so this is, while this is\nepisode five, I believe it is,\n\n21\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.580\nwe're at our second episode\nregarding the OSI model.\n\n22\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.870\nSo if I can just go to my\ncomputer screen for a minute.\n\n23\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.620\nI brought back up the seven\nlayer OSI model that we\n\n24\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.610\ntalked about in the previous section.\n\n25\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.055\nSo we got the same picture up,\nhopefully it will pull up.\n\n26\n00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:46.395\nYou've watched these in consecutive order,\nat least these couple of episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.555\nAnd today, in this episode,\n\n28\n00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:51.465\nwhat I wanna talk a little bit\nabout are what we call ports.\n\n29\n00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:57.905\nIn this encapsulation de-capsulation\nprocess, there's a place in here\n\n30\n00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:02.195\nthat takes place right in\nthis area right in here.\n\n31\n00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:04.016\nYou can see my mouse moving around it.\n\n32\n00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:08.363\nWhere, the destination,\nthe origination and\n\n33\n00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:13.037\ndestination addresses,\nare added into the mix and\n\n34\n00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:17.831\nit begins to tell the systems\nwhere to send the data.\n\n35\n00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:22.598\nDoesn't tell it what it's supposed to do\nwith it, it just says here's where you've\n\n36\n00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:25.905\ngot to go with it and\nit takes this little part right in here,\n\n37\n00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.570\nthe data packet we talked about,\nand it does its thing with that.\n\n38\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.799\nWhat we are going to talk about in this\nsession is about what we call common ports\n\n39\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.520\nand those occur at this layer right\nhere called the transport layer.\n\n40\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.450\nSo, let's pretend for a minute.\n\n41\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.330\nI haven't talked about IP addresses,\nbut I will in a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.000\nThe IP address of the origination\nmachine is, let's just call it, dot ten.\n\n43\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.620\nAnd it says,\n\n44\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.700\nI want to send this to a machine with\nthe address that ends in dot 12.\n\n45\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.660\nWell, it's one thing to send it to that\nmachine at the dot 12 address, but\n\n46\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.040\nit has to also know, on the other end,\n\n47\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.670\nwhat specific port to\ndeliver the information to.\n\n48\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.840\nAnd the reason we do that is because\nthere may be multiple services or\n\n49\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.910\napplications running on that end machine.\n\n50\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.590\nAnd each service and each application,\nthe way the operating system\n\n51\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.440\nkeeps them separate from each other is\nit assigns those to what we call ports.\n\n52\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.630\nYou can think of ports as just\nsimply specific locations in Ram.\n\n53\n00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.770\nSomething like that in terms of,\nlet's say you\n\n54\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.950\nhave an address of dot 11, and\nthat address, if it were a house,\n\n55\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.845\nwas a multi-tenant building, and\nit had three apartments in it.\n\n56\n00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:55.505\nYou'd have to know whether you\ngot the right address, but\n\n57\n00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.500\nyou'd need to know whether to send it to\napartment A, apartment B, or apartment C.\n\n58\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.229\nIn this place we talk about common ports.\n\n59\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.520\nSo not only is it important for\nyou to understand the OSI model,\n\n60\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.600\nit's important that you understand these\ncommon ports because these are what\n\n61\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.840\nmost of the applications, and\nthey're called common ports for\n\n62\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.190\nthat very reason, because the common\napplications that we use on a day to day\n\n63\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.900\nbasis in most IT shops will\nrun on most of these ports.\n\n64\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.380\nSo I'm gonna talk a little\nbit about each of these.\n\n65\n00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.770\nPort 20 and 21 are typically\nassociated with a service called FTP.\n\n66\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.300\nOr file transfer protocol.\n\n67\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.880\nFTP uses two ports.\n\n68\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.500\nIt's one of the more unusual applications.\n\n69\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.240\nBut it's also one of\nthe oldest applications.\n\n70\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.330\nFTP was built and\ndeveloped way back in the very early 80's,\n\n71\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.600\nlate 70's even, I think.\n\n72\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.360\nSo it uses one of those two ports for\ncommunication for\n\n73\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.170\nyou to send commands back and\nforth between the two machines and\n\n74\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.010\nit uses port 21 to actually\ndo the data transfer.\n\n75\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.390\nOkay, and so that way I can actually\nbe sending communications while\n\n76\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.080\nI'm sending or receiving data, and that's\nwhat it was designed to do in the day,\n\n77\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.950\nbecause back then,\nbandwidth was extremely precious.\n\n78\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.060\nWe were moving files across cables\nthat would only let us do, perhaps,\n\n79\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.468\ntwo megabit a second, versus today,\nwhere we're going multi-gigabit.\n\n80\n00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:24.310\nSo it was important to be able to not\nhave to wait until your transmission\n\n81\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.360\nis completed before you\ncan send another command.\n\n82\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.120\nThink of it as, in the old days\nwhen we were on token ring,\n\n83\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.850\nit was kind of like talking\nto the Martian rover.\n\n84\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.790\nWhere you had to send a signal, you had to\nwait for four days for it to get there.\n\n85\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.140\nAnd then it would execute and then you had\nto wait for the return video to get back\n\n86\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.530\nto see what it actually did before\nyou could send another command.\n\n87\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.930\nCuz if you send another\ncommand in the mean time,\n\n88\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.730\nnot only would it bang into the same\ncommunications, but you might send\n\n89\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.060\nthe rover off the side of a cliff\nsomewhere and have a pretty big disaster.\n\n90\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.726\n>> That'd be fun.\n\n91\n00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:58.060\n[LAUGH] That's a multi-billion dollar\nthing that just got destroyed.\n\n92\n00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.880\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n93\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.170\nSo today we don't see that so much.\n\n94\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.440\nThere are a few protocols, still,\nthat use multi-channel for\n\n95\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.900\ncommunication and data transfers,\nbut very few of them.\n\n96\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.410\nFTP is the only one that you\nwill see in regular use.\n\n97\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.670\nThe other thing that's peculiar about\nFTP that you need to know about is that\n\n98\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.999\nthe data streams are sent,\nin what we call, in the clear.\n\n99\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.260\nWhat that means is that the data's\nnot encrypted or encoded in any way.\n\n100\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.400\nIt's raw text or raw jpeg,\n\n101\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.180\nwhatever it is, that data stream\nis completely unencrypted.\n\n102\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.420\nAnyone who can capture it in midstream or\nthe man-in-the-middle attack,\n\n103\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.740\netc., can read that data.\n\n104\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.279\nTherefore it's not very secure.\n\n105\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.420\nThe CIA triad, in other words,\nthat we've talked about before.\n\n106\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.720\nThe confidentiality leg pretty much\ngets knocked out from underneath that\n\n107\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.860\nin that protocol.\n\n108\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.910\nHowever, it's very fast.\n\n109\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.250\nYou still see it used a lot, internally,\n\n110\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.340\ninside an organization because they're\nnot really that concerned about security\n\n111\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.748\nas long as the data is traversing\nthe internal local area network.\n\n112\n00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:04.660\nWhen that traffic starts going in and\n\n113\n00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.370\nout over the internet,\nthat's a whole different conversation.\n\n114\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.000\nI start getting nervous\nwhen I see that happen.\n\n115\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.140\nYou'll see FTP used quite a bit with AS\n400's and mainframes because again, those\n\n116\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.830\nwere all designed and built back in the\n70's and 80's and it works really well.\n\n117\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.500\nSo you know, why fix if it ain't broke,\nI guess is the term.\n\n118\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.260\nBut again, it's extremely insecure.\n\n119\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.750\nAnd so one of the ways we\ndeal with that today is we\n\n120\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.770\nuse what we would call a compensating\ncontrol since we can't encrypt the data,\n\n121\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.880\nwhich would be our first line of\ndefense in terms of a normal control.\n\n122\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.210\nWe might restrict traffic to and\nfrom the host and between the two hosts.\n\n123\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.850\nSo that the routers and\n\n124\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.952\nswitches will only let those two end\nnodes talk to each other over FTP.\n\n125\n00:07:56.952 --> 00:08:00.562\nTo the rest of the universe,\nFTP doesn't exist on that machine.\n\n126\n00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:03.290\nSo, that's a typical compensating control.\n\n127\n00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.921\nIt's not as good as encryption, but\nit will mitigate the risk to some level.\n\n128\n00:08:10.888 --> 00:08:15.170\nThe next port I want to talk about\nis port 22, which is right here.\n\n129\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.790\nPort 22 has been around\na really long time,\n\n130\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.810\nit's another clear text protocol,\nIt's called telmet.\n\n131\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.630\nSome of you may have seen that.\n\n132\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.610\nYou may have used it on Cisco routers or\nswitches.\n\n133\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.900\nIt's a protocol designed to talk to,\n\n134\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.010\nit was originally designed to\ntalk to mainframes, AS4 etc.\n\n135\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.060\nAs well as other Unix machines.\n\n136\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.790\nIt typically runs through what we would\ncall a command or terminal window, and\n\n137\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.270\nit's all keyboard oriented,\nmuch like FTP is the same way.\n\n138\n00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.970\nThey are graphical applications for\nboth FTP and Telnet, but\n\n139\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.480\nthey actually ride on\ntop of the command line.\n\n140\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.710\nFTP was written long before we ever even\nthought about what a Windows application\n\n141\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.100\nwas, or\nwhat a graphical user interface was.\n\n142\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.940\nEverything was text-based in those days,\nvery short, very quick and\n\n143\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.130\ndirty, works really, really well.\n\n144\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.790\nSecurity was not an issue,\nwe were more concerned about bandwidth and\n\n145\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.979\nspeed, etcetera because back in the day\nwe just didn't have much of that.\n\n146\n00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.080\nExcuse me, I got these backwards.\n\n147\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.570\n22 is S-S-H, 23 is Telnet,\n\n148\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.625\nI'm asleep at the wheel there because\nI just got back from lunch so.\n\n149\n00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.922\n>> [LAUGH] Lunch coma is\nsufficiently kicking in.\n\n150\n00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:29.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, move all that to\n\n151\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.540\nport 23 of what I just said.\n\n152\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.200\nI am, I'm really sorry I\njust got back from lunch and\n\n153\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.160\nI'm a little hazy from all the carbs.\n\n154\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.370\n23 is what Telnet runs on.\n\n155\n00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.800\n22 is the secure version of Telnet.\n\n156\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.860\nWe call that SSH for secured shell.\n\n157\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.140\nRemember I told you a minute\nago that in Telnet,\n\n158\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.540\nwe're typically talking\nabout a command line.\n\n159\n00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.430\nThat is,\nthat opens up in what we call a shell.\n\n160\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.630\nThat gives us access to the back\nend operating system, etcetera.\n\n161\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.870\nPort 22 Is a secure version of Telnet so\nit's called SSH.\n\n162\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.212\nWe also tend to use,\nespecially in the Unix and Linux world,\n\n163\n00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:16.740\nwe run a very special protocol called\nSCP over SSH, for secure copy.\n\n164\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.820\nAnd, what that allows us to\ndo is basically move files\n\n165\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.240\nlike we would with FTP,\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n166\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.430\nFTP is designed to move files\nfrom one system to another.\n\n167\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.150\nSCP allows us to do the same thing, but\n\n168\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.140\nit runs inside an SSH shell\nover port 22 securely.\n\n169\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.640\n>> Brian, what is it that\nmakes these protocols secure?\n\n170\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.670\n>> Encryption.\n\n171\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.710\n>> Plain and simple.\n\n172\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.430\nWhen you log into a Linux or\n\n173\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.790\nUnix system with SSH the very first time,\nit does a key exchange.\n\n174\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.010\nWe haven't talked about key exchange yet,\nbut we will.\n\n175\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.950\nAnd, from that point forward you've\ncreated a key on both ends and\n\n176\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.910\nso when you connect the very first time,\nbefore you send your username and\n\n177\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.052\npassword, it establishes\nan encrypted session.\n\n178\n00:11:04.052 --> 00:11:04.746\n>> Okay.\n\n179\n00:11:04.746 --> 00:11:11.340\n>> Okay, so SCP is the file copy\nprotocol we use over port 22.\n\n180\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.440\nThose are very common in today's\nworld in networking gear.\n\n181\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.940\nNetworking gear if you don't\nhave any experience in that.\n\n182\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.240\nCisco switches,\nCisco routers all run Telnet.\n\n183\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.970\nBut, most good admins will turn Telnet\noff and only manage those over SSH.\n\n184\n00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.380\nIn fact many organizations that's\na requirement and a standard.\n\n185\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.220\nWe've talked about requirements and\nstandards early on in the series.\n\n186\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.210\nAnd, that's to prevent\n\n187\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.160\nsomeone from inadvertently using Telnet\nto connect to one of those devices.\n\n188\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.230\nThey'll actually shut\nthe service down on the device.\n\n189\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.730\nSo, that even if you try to connect\nwith Telnet it won't answer.\n\n190\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.530\nNow, I lost my train of thought.\n\n191\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.350\nI'm trying to think of other things\nwhere you would see Telnet enabled.\n\n192\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.520\nThe Telnet client\n\n193\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.480\nactually is a little bit of\na dangerous client to have on your\n\n194\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.500\nmachine because it allows you to\nsound credentials in the clear.\n\n195\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.930\nIn Microsoft Windows,\nyou actually have to install it.\n\n196\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.870\nIt is not installed anymore\nby default on Windows 7.\n\n197\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.930\nI believe they stopped\ninstalling it in Vista,\n\n198\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.370\nwhere in XP it was actually\npart of the native install.\n\n199\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.705\nToday, you actually have\nto go into Windows,\n\n200\n00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.169\nadd/remove programs and\nadd it as a Windows feature.\n\n201\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.770\nAlmost no-one uses any more.\n\n202\n00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.100\nWindows does not have a built in SSH or\nSCP client.\n\n203\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.410\nBoth the Mac and Linux do.\n\n204\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.330\nIn the Windows world,\ntypically we use a client software,\n\n205\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.450\na graphic interface\nsoftware called WinSCP or\n\n206\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.660\nsomething like that,\nwhich allows us to do things graphically.\n\n207\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.300\nBut again, it's implementing\nan SSH shell underneath all that.\n\n208\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.270\nYou're just seeing\nthe graphical interface on top.\n\n209\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.280\nAll right, so let's move on to port 25.\n\n210\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.270\nAnd again, this is just a list of them.\n\n211\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:07.386\nThere are over 65,000 ports available for\nus to use.\n\n212\n00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:14.640\nAnd, we're only going to show you a few\nof what are called the common ports.\n\n213\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.590\nAnd, they're called common\nthey're been around the longest.\n\n214\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.820\nWe use them for a lot of different\nthings that are very familiar to most\n\n215\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.370\nof us working around IT shops.\n\n216\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:29.840\nPort 25 is what we run what we call SMTP\non, or simple mail transfer protocol.\n\n217\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.150\nThis again is an unsecure protocol.\n\n218\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.570\nIt's very seldom used anymore\nbecause it's not secured.\n\n219\n00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.880\nTypically what will happen is it will be\nredirected over another port using SSL.\n\n220\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.180\nAnd, we'll talk about SSL\nin a few minutes, but\n\n221\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.150\nI think most of you know what that,\nknow what SSL is.\n\n222\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.380\nAnd the reason is because\nwhen you're sending mail,\n\n223\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.056\nyou want it to go up to your\nserver in an encrypted format.\n\n224\n00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:57.480\nYou don't want to send\nan unencrypted email\n\n225\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.050\nout over the internet in case somebody\nwere to get ahold of it and read it,\n\n226\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.420\nthereby breaking the confidentiality\nleg of the three-legged stool.\n\n227\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.890\nPort 53 is what we run what's called DNS,\nor\n\n228\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.830\nDomain Name System services on.\n\n229\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.870\n53 can run both, and I haven't talked\nabout this, but it's in the book,\n\n230\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.510\nI'm not going to go into the details.\n\n231\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.860\nIt can run over both TCP, which stands for\ntranslation control protocol.\n\n232\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.550\nOr UDP, unigram data protocols.\n\n233\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:36.335\nOne is a best effort protocol,\none is a guaranteed delivery effort.\n\n234\n00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:39.555\nOkay, DNS can run over either of those.\n\n235\n00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:43.405\nEven DNS, which runs unencrypted and\nin the clear,\n\n236\n00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:48.885\nhas in recent years come under attack for\nnot having a secure counterpart.\n\n237\n00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:53.715\nAnd so, today in many organizations,\nwe run what we call secure DNS or\n\n238\n00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:59.950\nwe reroute DNS over another port, using\nsomething like SSL to encrypt the data.\n\n239\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.930\nThe reason is because the hackers can\nactually garner a lot of information\n\n240\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.850\nabout the activity going on in your\norganization by reading your DNS queries.\n\n241\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.730\nThe next port, 110, and the reason I'm\ngoing through these individually is,\n\n242\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.100\nthese will be on the test.\n\n243\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.150\nSome of these ports you'll get asked,\nwhat's this port for,\n\n244\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.190\nwhat's that port,\nwhat that port is for, etcetera.\n\n245\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.950\nYou'll need to know these, okay?\n\n246\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.550\nPort 110 is what we call POP,\nor post office protocol.\n\n247\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.950\nIt is an unencrypted port and\nprotocol, and\n\n248\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.670\ntypically is used for\npulling mail down from a mail server.\n\n249\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:40.140\nSMTP is used to send mail,\nPOP is used to pull mail down.\n\n250\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.289\nAgain, we do kind of the same thing, very\nfew people actually use this any more,\n\n251\n00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:48.212\nat least very few people who are fairly\nsmart stopped using it long time ago.\n\n252\n00:15:48.212 --> 00:15:52.945\nWe re-route it again over a different\nport, a higher number port,\n\n253\n00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:57.524\nusing SSL or something like that,\nor TLS or something like that.\n\n254\n00:15:57.524 --> 00:16:02.330\nExcuse me, in order to prevent people from\nreading the mail if they were to get in\n\n255\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.260\nthe middle of that conversation\ncoming downstream.\n\n256\n00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.490\nI don't remember what 119 is, do you?\n\n257\n00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.620\n>> Network News, I think it is.\n\n258\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.583\n>> Network News,\nthat's why I don't remember it.\n\n259\n00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:13.133\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n260\n00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:14.560\n>> Because no one uses it, anymore.\n\n261\n00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.890\nIt is an unsecured protocol and\nyou will not see it on the test.\n\n262\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.010\nYou probably will not see 143 either so\nI'm gonna leave that one alone but\n\n263\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.450\nwhat you will see, I know what we missed,\nwe missed port 80.\n\n264\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.770\nSo, port 80 we missed that on our list,\napologize for\n\n265\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.610\nthat, we'll get that added the next time.\n\n266\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.631\nPort 80 is what most web browsers run on.\n\n267\n00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:35.048\n>> So port you want to outlaw, right?\n\n268\n00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:36.052\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n269\n00:16:36.052 --> 00:16:43.265\nSo when you type HTTP colon whack, whack,\nsomething, you're running over Port 80.\n\n270\n00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:47.351\nThat is an unsecured port,\nit's an unsecured protocol but\n\n271\n00:16:47.351 --> 00:16:49.630\nit runs really fast.\n\n272\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.390\nAs we know,\nanytime you introduce encryption,\n\n273\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.170\nyou're gonna slow things down because\nthere's an encryption process and\n\n274\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:01.610\na decryption process and they take CPU,\nresources, RAM, etc., etc.\n\n275\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.890\nSo 80 is very fast but\nit's completely unsecured.\n\n276\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.670\n443 is its secured counterpart.\n\n277\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:14.018\n443 is hopefully what you are using when\nyou go to your bank or you go to Amazon,\n\n278\n00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:19.055\nanytime you use a credit card,\nanytime you're transmitting anything over\n\n279\n00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:23.871\nthe Internet that needs to be secured,\nyou should be using Port 443.\n\n280\n00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:26.219\nThe way to tell that in\nWindows is to look for\n\n281\n00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:29.026\nthe little lock in the lower\nhand of your browser and\n\n282\n00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:33.290\nit's my opinion that all traffic across\nthe Internet should be over 443.\n\n283\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.490\nThat port 80 really ought\nto just be outlawed.\n\n284\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.250\nIt just simply causes too many problems.\n\n285\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:46.150\nEven in the browser, I'm doing some\nwork with a large government agency and\n\n286\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:51.190\nI have a government issued laptop,\nand the browser on it,\n\n287\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.840\nit's still running Windows 7, using\nInternet Explorer 11, is not configured to\n\n288\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.860\nallow both secure and nonsecure content\nto be delivered without a warning.\n\n289\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.900\nSo every time I go to an HTTPS site,\nthere's bound to be images or text or\n\n290\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.498\nsomething on that website that is not\nbeing pulled across from a secured server.\n\n291\n00:18:11.498 --> 00:18:15.290\nIt's just plain so I get all kinds of\nerrors and stuff and it drives me insane.\n\n292\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.110\nJust put everything under 443 and\nbe done with it, world.\n\n293\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.570\nGet rid of Port 80,\nget rid of Port 23, get rid of FTP.\n\n294\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.070\nJust outlaw them, plain and simple.\n\n295\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.740\nThere are other ways you can\nget around that stuff, okay.\n\n296\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.160\nIn the mainframe world, I hear this\nall the time, well, FTP worked really,\n\n297\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.977\nreally well.\n\n298\n00:18:33.977 --> 00:18:34.814\nWell, you know what?\n\n299\n00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:38.670\nSo does SFTP,\nwhich is a secure version of FTP.\n\n300\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.900\nIt simply runs on another port and\n\n301\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.690\nit's really not all that\ndifficult to get up and running.\n\n302\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.650\n>> We don't have the bandwidth limitations\nthat we once had or the problems\n\n303\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.800\nwith computing power that we once had so\nencryption is really a viable solution for\n\n304\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.500\njust about everything anymore and\nwe talk about this, there's really no good\n\n305\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.930\nreason not to be using secure protocols,\nat least generally, I would say.\n\n306\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.680\nFor the most part-\n>> For everything.\n\n307\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.820\n>> Encrypt everything you like and\nall these systems work very well.\n\n308\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.960\nYou don't even have to really get\ninvolved in any of these things.\n\n309\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.230\nLike you said, when the conversation\nstarts, they go, hey,\n\n310\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.160\nI'd like to use some encryption,\nhow about you?\n\n311\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.690\nI'd love to do that,\nlet's create some keys and exchange them.\n\n312\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.490\nAnd this is all happening with you just\nclicking, I want to connect to this site,\n\n313\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.310\nI want to connect to this device,\nI wanna send data.\n\n314\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.080\nThey all do it for you, we don't have\nto take part in that conversation,\n\n315\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.595\nand that's the way we like it.\n\n316\n00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:32.657\n[LAUGH]\n>> One of the things you might even think\n\n317\n00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:37.704\nabout doing is, if you don't want\nGoogle tracking what you look at,\n\n318\n00:19:37.704 --> 00:19:43.101\nyou can actually make sure that when\nyou go to google.com to do searches,\n\n319\n00:19:43.101 --> 00:19:45.822\nyou go to https://google.com.\n\n320\n00:19:45.822 --> 00:19:50.774\nThereby, any search request that you put\nin there are going to go across encrypted,\n\n321\n00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.800\nand Google can't read them or track them.\n\n322\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.750\nNow, the results may take you\nto unencrypted sites, and\n\n323\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:03.320\nif you click on those links, then Google\nhas the ability to grab that information,\n\n324\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.770\nand track it again.\n\n325\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.070\nBut you can also see before you click\non it whether it's secure or not.\n\n326\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.350\nSo try to use encryption\nas much as possible.\n\n327\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.510\nIt's really not that\ndifficult any more today.\n\n328\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.750\nWhen you go in and\nyou do an audit, for instance,\n\n329\n00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.970\nmaybe you're doing an application or maybe\nyou're just doing general IT audit stuff.\n\n330\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.740\nHere's a great example of that.\n\n331\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.770\nRecently, I did an Nmap scan, we talked\nabout that in the previous session.\n\n332\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.990\nI did not do a vulnerability scan,\nI just pure and\n\n333\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.280\nsimple, just a little baby Nmap\nscan against a set of about 35 or\n\n334\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.300\n36 IP addresses, and\nI found four machines running FTP.\n\n335\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.090\nSo Port 20 and 21 appeared as open and\n\n336\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.780\nrunning that FTP service\non those machines.\n\n337\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.400\nAnd I went to the head\nof infrastructure and\n\n338\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.190\nI said, can you explain to me why\nFTP's running on those machines?\n\n339\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.270\nI didn't say you should stop doing this,\nI wasn't a big mean security,\n\n340\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.190\nI just said can you explain that to me?\n\n341\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.862\nAnd he looked and he went,\nno, I have no idea.\n\n342\n00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:06.860\nSo we're able to actually discover that\nthere were services running on machines\n\n343\n00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.720\nthat he didn't know about and\nthose machines are his responsibility.\n\n344\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.920\nSo he went to the application and\ndata owners and said, what's the deal?\n\n345\n00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.000\nWhy are we running FTP on this?\n\n346\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.030\nAnd they came back and said,\nwell, basically wah, wah, wah,\n\n347\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.800\nbecause we didn't wanna have to\nmess with implementing encryption.\n\n348\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.880\nAnd I said, well, does the CIO and\n\n349\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.820\nCEO know that because you're making\ndecisions that impact the company's risk.\n\n350\n00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.320\nYou don't have the authority to do that.\n\n351\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.378\nAnd that's really what the auditor will\nrun into more often times than not is that\n\n352\n00:21:37.378 --> 00:21:42.260\npeople inside an IT organization\nare making decisions about risk for\n\n353\n00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.710\nwhich they're not accountable and\nthey're not authorized to do.\n\n354\n00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.680\nBut because those decisions have not\nbeen escalated through to management,\n\n355\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.820\nmanagement is completely unaware of them.\n\n356\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.300\nAnd what you'll find is just like I did,\n\n357\n00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.390\nI bring him to the CIO's attention,\nand, my goodness.\n\n358\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:04.170\nAnother good example of that was, I was\nlogging into the SharePort portal one day,\n\n359\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.480\nand I notice that it was not redirecting\nto https and I went, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n360\n00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.950\nSo what that means is I went to\nPort 80 at the SharePoint portal,\n\n361\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.110\ntyped in my username and password, and\nwaited for it to redirect to Port 443 so\n\n362\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.985\nit would send my credentials encrypted,\nand it didn't.\n\n363\n00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:23.990\n[LAUGH] Again, I-\n>> That's dangerous.\n\n364\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.450\n>> I contacted the director of,\n\n365\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.870\nyeah, because my credentials just went\nacross the Internet in the clear.\n\n366\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.720\nAnd I contacted the manager and\nI said, can you explain this?\n\n367\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.140\nYeah, I remember now,\n\n368\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.120\na couple months ago we had a problem\nwith something, and so we turned it off.\n\n369\n00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.120\nYeah?\n\n370\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.190\nDid you fix the problem?\n\n371\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.680\nWhy didn't you turn it back on?\n\n372\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.530\nJust forgot.\n\n373\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.390\nGot busy and, how long ago was that?\n\n374\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.670\nMaybe six, seven months.\n\n375\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.900\nSo I said, so all of the company employees\nwho connect to this SharePoint site\n\n376\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.380\nafter hours are passing their active\ndirectory credentials in the clear\n\n377\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.150\nacross the Internet.\n\n378\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.989\nAnd as I was saying that, you could just\nsee it sinking in going, my goodness.\n\n379\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.410\nSo, two days later it was fixed.\n\n380\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.840\nAnd what's really ironic\nis that it turned out\n\n381\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.700\nthe problem that they thought was\ncausing it wasn't even there anymore.\n\n382\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.648\nThey just turned it back on and it worked.\n\n383\n00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:19.158\n>> Wow.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:23:19.158 --> 00:23:20.410\n>> Yeah, that's fun.\n\n385\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.780\n>> Yeah, six months.\n\n386\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.790\nSo when you're doing your scans,\nyou'll need to know what these ports are.\n\n387\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.970\nWhen you're asking questions, you'll\nneed to ask them about the protocols.\n\n388\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.460\nFTP, you need to know\nwhat these are about.\n\n389\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:37.045\nI'm sorry, and then the last one\nI wanna mention here the 1701 and\n\n390\n00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:40.790\n23 aren't really that important for\nour discussion.\n\n391\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.950\nThe last one I wanna mention is 3389.\n\n392\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.570\nFor those of you who are aware and\nmay have ever used it,\n\n393\n00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.347\nRDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n394\n00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:55.039\nIt appeared initially in Windows Server\n2000 because we needed a way to be able\n\n395\n00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:59.391\nto connect all these machines that were\nbeginning to explode on the Internet\n\n396\n00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:00.552\nback in those days.\n\n397\n00:24:00.552 --> 00:24:04.054\nI am old enough that I was back\naround when 2000 was deployed,\n\n398\n00:24:04.054 --> 00:24:06.100\nand I did the NT 4.0 upgrades.\n\n399\n00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.360\n>> I actually worked on NT 4\nsystems in my first IT job.\n\n400\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.580\n>> Well there you go.\n\n401\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.260\n>> So I was there, I was in the trenches.\n\n402\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.841\n>> There you go.\n\n403\n00:24:13.841 --> 00:24:14.422\nThere you go.\n\n404\n00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:17.810\nSo 3389 was designed, it was not\na secure protocol to begin with.\n\n405\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.235\nAnd it still actually is not a secure\nprotocol, but it often times is also run\n\n406\n00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:27.232\nover SSL, so that even though you are only\ngenerally capturing screen information.\n\n407\n00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:31.690\nYou are often times passing your active\ndirectory credentials to the remote\n\n408\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.240\ndesktop and you want to make sure\nthat those are encrypted as well.\n\n409\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.690\nSo, when you're out snooping around your\nnetworks, you're talking with your IT\n\n410\n00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.800\npeople, you wanna make sure that you\nask questions about these ports.\n\n411\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.450\nWhat's in use, what's not?\n\n412\n00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.600\nThey may have questions for you about do\nyou really know what you're talking about,\n\n413\n00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.131\netc.\n\n414\n00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:55.375\n[LAUGH] And then there's one more little,\nI wanna move this over here.\n\n415\n00:24:55.375 --> 00:25:00.104\nThere's another Graphic I'd\nlike to bring up to show\n\n416\n00:25:00.104 --> 00:25:05.250\nyou some of the services\nyou heard me talking about.\n\n417\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.900\nI can't make that graphic,\nlet me see if I can make that bigger.\n\n418\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:16.450\nI can, but yeah let me,\nbear with me for just a second guys.\n\n419\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.970\nI'm trying to get this over here so\nyou can see it.\n\n420\n00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.959\nBecause.\n\n421\n00:25:22.802 --> 00:25:23.662\nThere we go.\n\n422\n00:25:23.662 --> 00:25:24.904\n>> There you go.\n\n423\n00:25:24.904 --> 00:25:25.710\n>> Yeah.\n\n424\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.570\nHope you can see that a little better.\n\n425\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:32.040\nSo, now you can see what\nI was talking about,\n\n426\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.110\nbecause I've taken down the big OSI model.\n\n427\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.960\nYou can see the little OSI model over.\n\n428\n00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.480\nYou can see that, as I mentioned SSL,\nand HTTPS run over layer 5.\n\n429\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.450\nTLS is a layer 4 protocol,\nIP security which is what we use typically\n\n430\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:52.020\nin VPN's is a layer 3 technology and\nthen email encryption etc,\n\n431\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.980\nwhen I talk about PKI later and\none of our later sessions today.\n\n432\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.660\nIt actually occurs at\nthe application layer.\n\n433\n00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.780\nAnd then we when it talks about bulk line\nencryption down here as there are actually\n\n434\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.080\nways to invoke encryption over\nthe wire in your organization.\n\n435\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.430\nWe don't see too much of that anymore but\nit is an option to most of you.\n\n436\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.615\nSo now you know should have\na good handle on the osi.\n\n437\n00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:25.010\nYou should have a good handle on your\nstandard, what we will call common ports.\n\n438\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.240\nWhich ones are secure,\nwhich ones are not, and\n\n439\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.120\nhow they get secured,\nwhat the dangers are.\n\n440\n00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.544\nSo when you do your scans, and\nyou see it, and you do it an M map scan,\n\n441\n00:26:34.544 --> 00:26:36.935\nyou find five machines running 20 and 21.\n\n442\n00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:42.850\nDaniel, what would you expect to\nbe the most common Port 20 and\n\n443\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.390\n21, vulnerabilities found on the network.\n\n444\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:45.980\n>> It's 21.\n\n445\n00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.790\nI guess they're smurf attacks.\n\n446\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.070\n>> No, no, no,\nin terms of devices that are running FTP.\n\n447\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.400\n>> Devices that are running FTP.\n\n448\n00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.350\n>> You mentioned them earlier.\n\n449\n00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.050\nPrinters.\n>> Printers.\n\n450\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.710\nYeah, I was gonna say,\nI think printers use it.\n\n451\n00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.390\n>> Yeah, most printers,\nif you do a complete network scan and\n\n452\n00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.890\nyou're scanning your network printers.\n\n453\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.700\nYou'll find that almost all printers\nby default will run 20 and 21.\n\n454\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.572\nLord only knows why they still do that.\n\n455\n00:27:07.572 --> 00:27:09.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's no reason.\n\n456\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.820\n>> No good reason.\n\n457\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.325\n>> Even when they have hard drives and\nthey're making copies of all your stuff\n\n458\n00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:16.235\n>> Nobody uses FTP and I can tell you\n\n459\n00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:21.495\nfrom personal experience, there was an\norganization down in Kansas City years ago\n\n460\n00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:24.740\nwhere one of the internal employees\nwas eventually arrested for\n\n461\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.500\nhosting a porn site on\nstored all of his images.\n\n462\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.780\n>> No, no.\n>> On a hard drive on a scanner.\n\n463\n00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.460\nScanner printer.\n\n464\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.270\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n465\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.740\n>> I'll give him kudos for creativity.\n\n466\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.750\nThat's for sure.\n\n467\n00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.950\n>> Yeah, that's really scary.\n\n468\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.720\nAnd so you have to be careful\nwhen you do these scans.\n\n469\n00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.090\nYou'll discover that kind of stuff.\n\n470\n00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.320\nJust like the servers of\nthe infrastructure manager I mentioned.\n\n471\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.830\nAnd asked him why are they running and\nhe was like, I don't know,\n\n472\n00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.160\nI didn't know that they were.\n\n473\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.730\n>> And that's just really good\ncommon security procedure.\n\n474\n00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.320\nIf you're not using a service,\n\n475\n00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.410\neven if it's secure,\nthere's no reason to have it turned on.\n\n476\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.270\nThere's no reason to have it enabled.\n\n477\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.690\nSo if you do scans and\nyou find a server that says they're open,\n\n478\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.530\nyou say hey, here's a couple of machines\nthat I scanned, I found these services.\n\n479\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.140\nAre open and running on those devices.\n\n480\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.270\nWhy are we running these things?\n\n481\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.690\nAre they necessary?\n\n482\n00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.660\nIf your D-N-S server only does D-N-S,\nthere's no good reason for\n\n483\n00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.810\nit have done that, at all.\n\n484\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.890\nThere's not even a good\nreason to have S-S-H so\n\n485\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.550\nyou need to be able to ask\nthese types of questions.\n\n486\n00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:27.280\nAnd have them go,\nbecause I've had it happen to me before,\n\n487\n00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.730\npeople try to bully you\nwith their knowledge.\n\n488\n00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.820\nWell you still know what you're talking\nabout, but we have a good reason.\n\n489\n00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.100\nOkay, great.\n\n490\n00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.650\nWhat is that good reason?\n\n491\n00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.570\nAnd is it legit?\n\n492\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:36.710\nWas it authorized?\n\n493\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.070\nOr did you just kind of make\nthat decision on your own?\n\n494\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.480\nSo these are the kind of things that\nwe want to be able to equip youth and\n\n495\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.640\ngood people out there to be\nable to conversate and ask.\n\n496\n00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.210\n>> Right.\n\n497\n00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.360\nRight, exactly.\n\n498\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.080\nSo that's pretty much it for this session.\n\n499\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.310\nI want to make sure we're going to talk\na little bit about encryption later.\n\n500\n00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.090\nI saw some questions come in about TCP and\nUDP.\n\n501\n00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.710\nMaybe in the next session we can\ntalk a little bit about it but\n\n502\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.810\nI don't want to go into\nthe real details about that.\n\n503\n00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.390\nThere's a really nice section in the book,\nyou can read on that so\n\n504\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.910\nyou understand the differences.\n\n505\n00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.760\nJust because we have so\nmuch other material to cover.\n\n506\n00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.910\nSo, with that, I'll turn it back over\nto Daniel, and we'll go from there.\n\n507\n00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.630\n>> All right, Bryan, well,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n508\n00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.080\nThank you for teaching us what we can\nexpect when it comes to common ports,\n\n509\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.370\nhow they're used, the different services\nthat are working behind them, and\n\n510\n00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.800\na little more in-depth on the OSI as well.\n\n511\n00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.390\nDon't forget everyone to grab yourself a\ncopy of the CISA study guide, 4th edition,\n\n512\n00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.420\nwhich my good fellow right here, Mister\nBrian Ohare is one of the authors of.\n\n513\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.960\nThat being said, it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another great episode.\n\n514\n00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.210\nWe thank you guys for watching, but we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n515\n00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.730\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n516\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.660\n>> And I'm Brian O'hara.\n\n517\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.248\n>> And we'll see ya next time.\n\n518\n00:29:46.248 --> 00:29:54.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.490\nI am your host Daniel Lowry and\n\n4\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.970\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our CISA series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.328\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nthe authors, one of the authors of this\n\n6\n00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:31.748\nlovely study guide we've been using to\nhelp guide our path is our good friend Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:32.677\nBrian O' Hara.\n\n8\n00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:35.831\nBrian, welcome back to the show sir,\nso glad you could join us today,\n\n9\n00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:36.589\nhow is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.558\n>> Hi Daniel, it's going well,\nthank you, we're coming up on the end\n\n11\n00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:46.170\nof a long week here,\nin a great series in the CISA study guide.\n\n12\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.140\nIn this episode we're going to talk about\npublic key infrastructure and encryption.\n\n13\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.530\nAsymmetric, symmetric etcetera.\n\n14\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.130\nWe're also gonna talk just briefly I want\n\n15\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.720\nto mention before we get started\nbecause you've got to know these for\n\n16\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.590\nthe exam we're gonna talk about a couple\nof terms that you need to understand.\n\n17\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.010\nThe first one is called\na certificate authority.\n\n18\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.900\nWrite that down, take a note,\nlook it up in the book.\n\n19\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070\nMake sure you understand what\na the difference is between a certificate\n\n20\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.270\nauthority and\n\n21\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.370\na registration authority, those get\nmixed up in people's mind sometimes.\n\n22\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.530\nA registration authority is something\nlike GoDaddy where I might go and\n\n23\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.660\nregister a domain name.\n\n24\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.550\nThe certificate authority is\nthe organization who creates and\n\n25\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.860\nmanages the certificate that\nsays that I own that domain.\n\n26\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.370\nThose can be very\ndifferent organizations or\n\n27\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.390\nthey can be the same which\ncan be very confusing.\n\n28\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.450\nI can still remember back in the 90s when,\nif you wanted to register a domain,\n\n29\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.700\nthere was really only one place and\nthat was Network Solutions.\n\n30\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.810\nVerisign was the very second.\n\n31\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.620\nAnd you actually had,\nI did as a business owner,\n\n32\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.010\nI actually had to fax a copy of\nmy articles of incorporation and\n\n33\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.730\na signed letter from my attorney\nin order to register my domain.\n\n34\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.578\n>> It's a whole lot easier than that now.\n\n35\n00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:08.739\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is, and\n\n36\n00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.194\nthere's actually a drawback from that\nwhich is that, they were actually\n\n37\n00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:16.110\ndoing good company verification and\nvalidation when people registered domains.\n\n38\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.760\nToday, any moron with a credit card and\n12 bucks can buy a domain name and\n\n39\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.540\nstart hacking and\ndoing all kinds of bazar things.\n\n40\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.640\nSo that's the way it was\nin the early days, but\n\n41\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.350\nit's important that you understand\nthere's one other term.\n\n42\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.230\nSo certificate authority,\nregistration authority, and\n\n43\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.390\nthe certificate revocation list.\n\n44\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.620\nThese three things are built into almost\nall general operating systems today.\n\n45\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.050\nThere are a list of trusted\n\n46\n00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.420\ncertificate authorities built\ninto your operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.240\nSo that when you go to Amazon.com,\nyou don't really have to go and\n\n48\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.030\nget a copy and\nlook up Amazon's certificate.\n\n49\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.370\nIt is a trusted certificate.\n\n50\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.890\nAnd it's been verified and\nvalidated by the certificate of authority.\n\n51\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.120\nSo your operating system\nalready has that loaded,\n\n52\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.270\nallows things to happen very quickly and\nvery securely.\n\n53\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.780\nIt's some of the stuff\nthat you don't see that\n\n54\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.410\noperates under the hood of your operating\nsystem that we sometimes take for granted.\n\n55\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.530\nThe certificate revocation list is\nvery important for things like,\n\n56\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.200\nrecently I purchased a digital\ncertificate for my email.\n\n57\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.070\nAnd just for testing purposes I revoked\nit a few minutes after I purchased\n\n58\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.010\nit just to see what would happen with\nthat particular registration authority.\n\n59\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.470\nAnd it was revoked successfully.\n\n60\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.790\nI tried to use it and\ncuz I'd already downloaded it and\n\n61\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.700\nimported it into my system,\nand it would not work.\n\n62\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.090\nSo, that's one way to test those things.\n\n63\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.430\nThose become really important because, in\na couple of minutes, when I start talking\n\n64\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.730\nabout public key infrastructure or\nthose certificate authorities,\n\n65\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.640\nand registration authorities,\nand certificate revocation lists\n\n66\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.400\nbecome extremely important in terms of how\nwe manage encryption across the Internet.\n\n67\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.770\nWith literally millions, and millions, and\nmillions of certificates being generated\n\n68\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.910\nall over the world, we have to\nhave very robust, very reliable,\n\n69\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.950\nand very secure systems\nthat manage all of that.\n\n70\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.790\nOtherwise, it would be complete chaos,\nokay.\n\n71\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.050\nThere are a number of types of\n\n72\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.780\nencryption that you need\nto understand the terms of.\n\n73\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.050\nYou just have to have a basic\nunderstanding of them,\n\n74\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.550\nyou don't have to do\nthe mathematics behind any of this.\n\n75\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.810\nI can't do the mathematics\nbehind any of it.\n\n76\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.460\nBut the first two what you want to make\na note about and make sure you understand\n\n77\n00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.910\nare the difference between symmetric and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n78\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.530\nOkay?\nSymmetric and Asymmetric.\n\n79\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.470\nSymmetric encryption is much like what\nhappens when you go to Amazon.com\n\n80\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.040\nboth ends of the equation use the same\ncertificate, or the same key,\n\n81\n00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.200\nin order for things to happen really fast.\n\n82\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.720\nOkay, Symmetric key encryption\ncan happen very quickly,\n\n83\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.820\nbecause both ends have a copy\nof the exact same key.\n\n84\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.190\nThere doesn't need to be any secret to the\nkey because the key has been generated by\n\n85\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.160\ncertificate authority everybody knows it,\neverybody trust it so,\n\n86\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.010\nwhen you go to https://www.amazon.com\n\n87\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.541\nthat keys gets invoked and\nyour traffic begins moving very quickly.\n\n88\n00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:35.970\nSo asymmetric encryption is fast.\n\n89\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.450\nIt's fairly reliable and robust, but\n\n90\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.200\nif those encryption keys\nwere ever compromised,\n\n91\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.070\nthey have to show up in the certificate\nof revocation list very quickly.\n\n92\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.700\nOtherwise, you'd be able\nto steal the keys and\n\n93\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.290\nredirect traffic to\nwebsites that weren't safe.\n\n94\n00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.020\nThat were bogus.\n\n95\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.240\nAsymmetric encryption is a much slower,\n\n96\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.330\non the order of ten times, so\nwhen you're doing asymmetric encryption it\n\n97\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.820\nneeds to be in an environment where you\ndon't need to get things super super fast.\n\n98\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.130\nThat's why we use it with email encryption\nand digital signatures because that's\n\n99\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.660\ngenerally something we can wait 30 seconds\nto emit it to receive an email and in fact\n\n100\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.889\nyou may find that when you send encrypted\nor signed, digitally signed emails or\n\n101\n00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.890\ndocuments they take a little longer to\nopen or to get to the other end and\n\n102\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.960\nthat's because the decryption process\nthat has to occur at the other end.\n\n103\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.600\nNow in a minute, I'm gonna talk about\nhow public key infrastructure works with\n\n104\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:48.050\nregard to encrypting, and signing\ndigitally email communications, okay.\n\n105\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.470\nSo we'll talk a little bit that,\nin a minute.\n\n106\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.140\nSo, in terms of subtypes of symmetric and\nor\n\n107\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.190\nasymmetric encryption, there are also\ntwo terms that you need to be aware of.\n\n108\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.860\nBoth elliptic curve and\nquantum encryption.\n\n109\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.090\nElliptic curve, I could bring a graphic\nup but there's one in the book and\n\n110\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.276\nit's very complex.\n\n111\n00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:15.915\nMathematically uses spots\non a elliptic curve\n\n112\n00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:20.831\nto generate the random, if you will, or\n\n113\n00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:26.337\nhaphazard keys to which\nthe algorithm uses.\n\n114\n00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:30.449\nIt's very very hard to reverse engineer\nbecause you have to know all these\n\n115\n00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.229\nmultiple billion points on the electrical\ncurve to be able to try and\n\n116\n00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.966\nfigure it out and\nit's virtually unbreakable.\n\n117\n00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:41.994\nQuantum encryption is\nprobably going to be what we\n\n118\n00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:46.901\nsee in the next century in\nterms of the idea is that\n\n119\n00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:51.570\nthe observation of any\nevent will impact it and\n\n120\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:58.752\nquantum encryption uses that idea so\nthat- If it will generate a key and\n\n121\n00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:02.822\nif anything outside the realm of norms,\n\n122\n00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:08.000\neven views that transaction,\nthe key will break.\n\n123\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.020\nSo, if someone tries to look\nat it with a different key,\n\n124\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.220\nthey do anything at all to\nthat piece of encrypted data,\n\n125\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.230\nother than view it with the other half\nof the quantum key, it will break.\n\n126\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.720\n>> And when you say it breaks,\nit means that it destroys the data.\n\n127\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.086\n>> It becomes undecipherable.\n\n128\n00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:26.770\n>> Unusable at that point.\n\n129\n00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.466\n>> That's right,\nbecomes undecipherable at that point.\n\n130\n00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:32.970\nYou couldn't even decrypt it with the\nright key at that point, it's destroyed.\n\n131\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.100\nSo those are four key terms,\n\n132\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.260\nfive key terms you really need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n133\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.510\nPKI, for public key infrastructure.\n\n134\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.095\nSymmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\n135\n00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:48.040\nAn elliptical curve and\nquantum encryption.\n\n136\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.352\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout how public key encryption works.\n\n137\n00:08:53.352 --> 00:08:59.690\nAnd you'll see in just a minute why\nit is called public key encryption.\n\n138\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.059\nIf I could just go to my computer here for\na second,\n\n139\n00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:05.961\nI've got a graphic I wanna pull up for\nyou.\n\n140\n00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:10.879\nThe traditional names used in this\ndescription are Bob and Alice, and\n\n141\n00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:13.390\njust a little historical content.\n\n142\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:19.704\nThat comes from an old movie from the 70s,\ncalled, Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice.\n\n143\n00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:25.082\nThe gentlemen who invented this,\nI won't go into their names,\n\n144\n00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:29.764\nit's not all that important\nother than historically,\n\n145\n00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:32.995\nvery famous guys grew up in the 70s.\n\n146\n00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:36.662\nThey're engineers at MIT, and so\nthat's kind of where the Bob and Carol and\n\n147\n00:09:36.662 --> 00:09:40.572\nTed and Alice references come from, for\nthose of you who are interested or care.\n\n148\n00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:44.837\n[LAUGH] So, let's talk about this,\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n149\n00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:48.460\nYou'll notice that there's\ntwo instances of Bob.\n\n150\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.120\nBob has a Public Key and\na Secret Key, or Private Key, and\n\n151\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.730\nAlice has a Public and a Secret Key.\n\n152\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.060\nThose two keys are generated with\na very complex mathematical formula,\n\n153\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.380\nand they are related to\neach other mathematically.\n\n154\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.640\nYou don't need to know how\nthat happens mathematically.\n\n155\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.320\nYou just need to understand\nthat they are related.\n\n156\n00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.110\nAnything you do with one key,\nyou can only undo with the other.\n\n157\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.450\nSo if I do something to a piece\nof data with the Secret Key,\n\n158\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.640\nthe only way I can undo that,\nor review it, or decrypt it, or\n\n159\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.170\nwhatever, is with the opposite,\nwhich would be my Public Key.\n\n160\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.753\nAnd vice versa.\n\n161\n00:10:30.753 --> 00:10:32.650\nIf I do something with a Public Key,\n\n162\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.990\nthe only way to undo it\nis with the Secret Key.\n\n163\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.450\nSo, I designed this\n\n164\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.990\ndemonstration to show you exactly how\nPublic Key infrastructure is used.\n\n165\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:52.788\nIn both encrypting an email message and\ndigitally signing an email message cuz\n\n166\n00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:56.840\nthey're very different activities and it's\nimportant that you know the difference.\n\n167\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.170\nYou don't really need to remember\nthe details of this, other than\n\n168\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.550\nyou will need to know, I'm serious, you\nwill need to know which keys are used for\n\n169\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.920\nwhich process, so\nthis is really important, okay?\n\n170\n00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.640\nSo let's start with encryption.\n\n171\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.610\nWe'll go to digital signatures next.\n\n172\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.980\nSo to encrypt a message from Bob to Alice,\n\n173\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.440\nI'm going to take Alice's Public Key,\nbecause it's known to me.\n\n174\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.730\nIt's something I have access to.\n\n175\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.440\nSo I take Alice's Public Key and\n\n176\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.270\nI'm going to encrypt my\nmessage using that Public Key.\n\n177\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.332\nSo it uses what we call an RSA algorithm\nand it encrypts the message, and\n\n178\n00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:37.861\nthen I send it directly over to Alice,\nokay?\n\n179\n00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.930\nNow if you remember what I said before,\n\n180\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:45.380\nyou can only undo with a key something\nthat's done with a key with the opposite.\n\n181\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.380\n>> I think this is where people get\nconfused when it comes to PKI because\n\n182\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.910\nthey don't,\nlike why am I encrypting with Alice's key?\n\n183\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.770\nI'm not Alice,\nthat is why it is called a Public Key.\n\n184\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.970\nYou give it to the public so that people\ncan encrypt data and send it to you,\n\n185\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.400\nwhich only you can unencrypt-\n>> That-\n\n186\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.360\n>> That is the key to it.\n\n187\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.736\n>> No pun intended, yeah.\n\n188\n00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:10.931\nThat's the other half of it,\nis that ensures that the only person in\n\n189\n00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.171\nthe universe who can decrypt\nthis message is Alice,\n\n190\n00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.280\ncuz she's the only one\nwith the Secret Key.\n\n191\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.325\nThat's why managing these keys become so\nkey, [LAUGH] no pun intended.\n\n192\n00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:25.215\nIn the process, sorry about that.\n\n193\n00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:26.167\n>> The side is hurting.\n\n194\n00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.777\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] In that, if that Secret Key\n\n195\n00:12:28.777 --> 00:12:32.705\nwere ever compromised, you'd need to\nrevoke the certificate immediately because\n\n196\n00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:37.575\nnow someone else can pretend that they are\nyou and they can decrypt your messages.\n\n197\n00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.455\nSo I wanna be very clear about that.\n\n198\n00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:44.110\nYou encrypt with Alice's Public Key,\nsend her the message, and\n\n199\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.320\nshe then decrypts it with her Secret Key.\n\n200\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.490\nBecause she's the only person that\nhas the opposite of that Public Key.\n\n201\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.510\nIf you encrypted it with your Public Key\nand sent it to her, what's she gonna do?\n\n202\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.960\nShe doesn't know what your Secret Key,\nit's secret, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.070\nAnd she can't encrypt it\nwith your Secret Key,\n\n204\n00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.850\nbecause she doesn't have a copy of it.\n\n205\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.310\nSo, it's really the only logical choice,\nokay?\n\n206\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.060\nNow, so, we now know how to encrypt\na message to send to Alice,\n\n207\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:17.000\nwe take her Public Key, we run the RSA\nalgorithm against it on the message,\n\n208\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.390\nit encrypts it, and\nwe send it over to her.\n\n209\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.640\nThat provides for confidentiality.\n\n210\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.740\nOkay, that's one of the three legs of\nthe CIA triad stool we talked about\n\n211\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.190\nthat provides for confidentiality.\n\n212\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.300\nThis way only Alice can read this message.\n\n213\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.080\nIf anyone else were to\nintercept this message and\n\n214\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.170\ntry to read to read it, they could\nnot decrypt it without Alice's key.\n\n215\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.399\nNow, here's where it\ngets a little confusing.\n\n216\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:51.188\nSome other person can, Daniel,\nfor instance, he could encrypt\n\n217\n00:13:51.188 --> 00:13:55.986\nsomething with Alice's Public Key and\npretend to be Bob and send it.\n\n218\n00:13:55.986 --> 00:14:03.140\nAnd the fact that it's encrypted is in no\nway indicative of who sent the message.\n\n219\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.270\nIt only ensures that the message\nhas not been tampered with, okay?\n\n220\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.230\nIt's encrypted and\nthe only person that can see it is Alice.\n\n221\n00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.710\nSo it guarantees confidentiality, okay?\n\n222\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.500\nBut somebody could spoof Daniel's or\n\n223\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.510\nBob's address and take Alice's Public Key,\nencrypt it, and send it.\n\n224\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.345\nHere is where integrity and\nnon-repudiation come into play,\n\n225\n00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:29.770\nis with a digital signature.\n\n226\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.950\nA digital signature ensures\nthat the receiver knows\n\n227\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.150\nthat I am the person who sent that email.\n\n228\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.990\nNo one else on the planet\ncould have done it.\n\n229\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.710\nBecause I'm going to do\nit with my Secret Key.\n\n230\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.560\nAnd I'm the only person on\nthe planet who can do that.\n\n231\n00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:53.010\nSo I sign it, I create a hash,\nbasically, of the message.\n\n232\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.070\nAnd then I send it across the airwaves,\nand it gets to Alice.\n\n233\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.380\nAnd Alice takes my Public Key,\nthe other half of that, and\n\n234\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.200\nshe runs a hash against it and goes, yep.\n\n235\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.230\nThat came from Bob.\n\n236\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.360\nThere's no question about it.\n\n237\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.530\nBecause the only person in\nthe world who could've hashed that\n\n238\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.680\nhas to be Bob because I checked with\nhis Public Key and it worked, okay?\n\n239\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.940\nBut, the message isn't encrypted.\n\n240\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.730\nSo all that it does is\nguarantee that I sent it.\n\n241\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.900\nIt's still not encrypted.\n\n242\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.542\nSo what we really wanna get to\nis how do you both encrypt and\n\n243\n00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:25.570\ndigitally sign a message?\n\n244\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.180\nThat way, I can ensure, number one,\nthat only the person that is intended\n\n245\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.580\nto receive it can see it and\nthat they will be assured that it\n\n246\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.750\ndidn't come from a spammer or a spoofer,\nthat it could have only come from me.\n\n247\n00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.490\nThat's called nonrepudiation, and you need\nto know what that word means as well.\n\n248\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.360\nThat means you cannot deny\nthat you sent it, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.231\nSo this is used inside\nthe federal government.\n\n250\n00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:51.859\nAny time emails are exchanged\ninside the federal government,\n\n251\n00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:55.292\nthey're using Public Key,\nPrivate Key infrastructure.\n\n252\n00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:58.615\nThat way there is an audit trail and\na non-repudiation trail for\n\n253\n00:15:58.615 --> 00:16:00.470\nevery single email that gets sent.\n\n254\n00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.200\nThey are all digitally signed,\nthey all have signatures on them.\n\n255\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.670\nThis is all being done through what is\ncalled the crypto subsystem in your\n\n256\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.460\noperating system.\n\n257\n00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.080\nThis happens behind the scenes, nobody\never sees it, but its actually working on\n\n258\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:19.720\nyour systems if you have, If you purchase\ndigital keys in order to do this.\n\n259\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.420\nThis does not happen by default.\n\n260\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:28.310\nSo, where we want to get with this, is how\ndo we digitally sign it, and encrypt it?\n\n261\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.180\nTwo steps, requires two keys.\n\n262\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.776\nOkay so,\nthe first thing that I am going to do,\n\n263\n00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:37.679\nis I am going to take my secret key and\nI am going to hash it.\n\n264\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.510\nOkay, I'm going to make sure that I\nput and attach a signature to this,\n\n265\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.310\na hash that matches the text that says\n\n266\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.620\nthere's no way this could have\ncome from anybody other than Bob.\n\n267\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.040\nOkay so I've used my secret key.\n\n268\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.260\nThat's the first step.\n\n269\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.820\nThe second step is now I'm going\nto take Alice's public key and\n\n270\n00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.790\nI'm going to encrypt it.\n\n271\n00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.888\nNow I send it across the wire [SOUND],\nI don't want to have an arrow there.\n\n272\n00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:08.590\nBut, it goes across the wire over\nhere to Alice and Alice gets it.\n\n273\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.270\nNow what happens with Alice?\n\n274\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.400\nThe first thing Alice\ndoes is she decrypts it\n\n275\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.440\nwith my public key which\nshe has access to.\n\n276\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.080\nShe decrypts it and she goes,\nokay, I can see it but\n\n277\n00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.170\nI don't know that this\ncame from Bob really.\n\n278\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.670\nSo, now she says, hm, so, or excuse me.\n\n279\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.260\n>> She yeah,\nshe didn't decrypt it with your key\n\n280\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.432\n>> I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\n\n281\n00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:30.630\nI got ahead of myself.\n\n282\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.200\nYeah, she decrypts it with her public key.\n\n283\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.430\nThat reverse engineers, or\nexcuse me with her secret key, yeah.\n\n284\n00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.080\n>> It gets confusing really quickly,\ndoesn't it?\n\n285\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.520\n>> No no.\n[LAUGH] It's the end of the day,\n\n286\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.310\nI'm tired, I'm sorry.\n\n287\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.890\nShe decrypts it with her secret key.\n\n288\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.930\nBut, she still doesn't know\nthat it came from Bob.\n\n289\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.150\nSo, how does she know\nthat it came from Bob?\n\n290\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.740\nShe then takes the hash\nthat she's just decrypted\n\n291\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.670\nbecause she can't read the hash\nuntil she decrypts it.\n\n292\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.710\nSo, she has to decrypt it first and\nthen she takes the hash,\n\n293\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.510\ntakes Bob's public key over here, reruns\nthat public key against the message she's\n\n294\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:11.340\ndecrypted and if the hashes match,\nthen non-repudiation is in play and\n\n295\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.610\nwe know that the message\nactually came from Bob.\n\n296\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.890\nSo, you see that there\nare two keys in play.\n\n297\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.460\nAnd, that those two keys provide for\nboth non-repudiation,\n\n298\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.740\nmeaning I can't deny that I sent it and\nit's proof that it came from me.\n\n299\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:37.360\nAnd, secondly it comes encrypted so\nthat only you can read it.\n\n300\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.700\nNow, the third piece to it is\nbecause its encrypted if anyone has\n\n301\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:48.220\ntampered with this in the process\nit breaks the encryption.\n\n302\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.250\nSo, if it arrives at Alice's destination,\nand none of these keys work, she\n\n303\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.570\nknows the message has been tampered with,\nand she knows that it's not legitimate.\n\n304\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.690\nShe doesn't even have\nto use the keys at all,\n\n305\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.720\nshe can tell it's been\ntampered with immediately.\n\n306\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.640\nSo, at the end of the day, we encrypt\nwith the recipient's public key.\n\n307\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.590\nAnd the sign with the sender's Secret Key.\n\n308\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:19.560\nWe then decrypt with\nthe recipient's Secret Key and\n\n309\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.550\nwe verify and validate non-repudiation\nfrom the sender's Public Key.\n\n310\n00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:31.350\nNow that's a lot to absorb\nespecially with my goof up there.\n\n311\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.180\nI did, I got ahead of myself.\n\n312\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.065\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n313\n00:19:34.065 --> 00:19:37.280\n[Laughing].\nBut, this is a really important piece for\n\n314\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.860\nyou to understand.\n\n315\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.350\nThere'll be probably two or\nthree questions on the exam about this.\n\n316\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.000\nYou really have to make sure you\nunderstand which key is used for\n\n317\n00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.430\nwhich function.\n\n318\n00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.940\nSo, if you're not clear on this\nmake sure you go back in the book,\n\n319\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.680\nreread the chapter, do the questions,\n\n320\n00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.650\npractice that because there will not\nbe diagrams like this on the exam.\n\n321\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.350\nIt'll just be a question.\n\n322\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:03.240\nIt'll say Bob sent Alice a message and\nused this key.\n\n323\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.320\nWhat's wrong with this transmission,\nor something along those lines, okay?\n\n324\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.670\nSo, you got to make sure\nyou understand that.\n\n325\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.110\nAll right moving on.\n\n326\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.740\n>> Moving on.\n\n327\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.970\n>> I have one more piece to cover and then\nwe're going to wrap things up I think.\n\n328\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.350\nAnd that is I want to\ntalk a little bit about,\n\n329\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.600\nthis came up in the last episode and\ndidn't get a chance to finish it.\n\n330\n00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.388\nAnd, that is the trusted\nplatform module or TPM modules.\n\n331\n00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:34.210\nAll of this stuff we're talking about with\npublic keys and secret keys etcetera.\n\n332\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.820\nGenerally speaking,\nall of those keys are stored in software\n\n333\n00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.630\nin the operating system, that also goes to\n\n334\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:49.100\nthings like when we talked in one of\nthe earlier episodes about biometrics.\n\n335\n00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.330\nThe biometrics scans\nthat your system store.\n\n336\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.245\nAll that stuff is stored in software.\n\n337\n00:20:54.245 --> 00:20:56.870\nWell, software can be hacked, right?\n\n338\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.560\nWe all know that.\n\n339\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.070\nWe hear about it every day.\n\n340\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.430\nThe trusted platform module is\nsomething you don't normally see\n\n341\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.690\non what I would call\nconsumer level electronics.\n\n342\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.890\nYou will only typically see it\nin business class electronics,\n\n343\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.990\nmore expensive laptops and desktops.\n\n344\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.520\nYou don't even see it actually on\nthe more expensive Apple devices,\n\n345\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.430\nthey don't provide that.\n\n346\n00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:24.970\nYou don't see anything but this in\nthe defense industry or in high-security\n\n347\n00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.760\nplaces, like working with the FBI, or the\nDepartment of Justice, things like that.\n\n348\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.190\nAll of those machines\nhave TPM chips in them.\n\n349\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.600\n>> I feel good now because all the laptops\nI have at home have TPM chips.\n\n350\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.370\n>> Well, good.\n\n351\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.670\n>> Except for my Mac.\n\n352\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.740\n>> Exactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.430\n>> Well, what the TPM chip does is\n\n354\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.940\nit's actually been boiled\ndown to a chip today, but\n\n355\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:47.600\nit started off originally as a processor\nboard on the motherboard of machines,\n\n356\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.070\nand what it does is it stores\nthose keys in hardware.\n\n357\n00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:57.105\nAnd, it does so in a way that makes it\nvirtually impossible to access those and\n\n358\n00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:59.472\ncompromise them in anyway.\n\n359\n00:21:59.472 --> 00:22:04.000\nSo, they're only accessible by the\noperating system, once the system has been\n\n360\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.222\nbooted, you've been authenticated,\nyou've been authorized etcetera.\n\n361\n00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:10.890\nAnd then, it only retrieves\nthe keys when they're needed.\n\n362\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.542\nAs soon as they're no longer needed\nthey're removed from memory,\n\n363\n00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:14.470\netcetera, etcetera.\n\n364\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.780\nWhere, the software based system like\nthis, those keys can reside in memory for\n\n365\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.750\nhours.\n\n366\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:27.110\nThey can be attacked if a hacker has\nremote access to your machine, etcetera.\n\n367\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:33.980\nTPM is a much higher level\nsecurity device used on systems.\n\n368\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.599\nIt's important as an auditor for\nyou to ask those kinds of questions.\n\n369\n00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.830\nWhen you're doing your audit work,\ndo you use TPM modules in your hardware?\n\n370\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.850\nAre those used on your servers?\n\n371\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.230\nAre they used on your workstations?\n\n372\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.140\nWhere do you use those?\n\n373\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.180\nOr, are they all stored in software?\n\n374\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.110\nThe other thing to talk about\nis an active directory.\n\n375\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:02.860\nSo many places I see this where there\nare a plethora of network devices and\n\n376\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.500\nthey all require HTTPS administration.\n\n377\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.170\nThey all have HTTPS web portal\nadministration interfaces.\n\n378\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.900\nAnd, the network guys use what we\ncall self-signed certificates.\n\n379\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.930\nThose are the ones that you come up and\nyou go to log in,\n\n380\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.430\nthey say I can't verify\nthe identity of this certificate,\n\n381\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.470\ndo you want to continue, and\nyou go next, next, next, next.\n\n382\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.580\nWell, that exposes you to attacks because\nwhat that means is you get in such\n\n383\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.890\na habit of just simply saying yes that\nif I do a man in the middle attack and\n\n384\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.790\nI proxy that server and\nthrow another certificate at you, and\n\n385\n00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.490\nyou just go click, next thing you know,\n\n386\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.290\nyou're logged into my system, not\nthe device you think you're logging into.\n\n387\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.860\nAnd next thing you know, you're passing\ncredentials to me, and I'm reading them.\n\n388\n00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.786\nI could even pass your traffic on, so the\ndevice works the way you think it should.\n\n389\n00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:54.527\nMaybe there's a little lag, but\nyou don't know any difference.\n\n390\n00:23:54.527 --> 00:23:59.379\nSo I strongly urge internal\nnetwork operations to never to\n\n391\n00:23:59.379 --> 00:24:02.480\nuse self signed certificates.\n\n392\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.480\nBut the reason they do is\nbecause it's difficult,\n\n393\n00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.800\nthey have to set up a certificate server,\none of the biggest problems or\n\n394\n00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.220\nheadaches in managing\ncertificates is storage.\n\n395\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.290\nStorage and\nmaking sure that they're backed up,\n\n396\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.520\nthat they're stored securely, that only\ncertain people with administrative\n\n397\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.360\nprivileges can access them, etc.\n\n398\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.610\nIn the new Windows 10 Surface Pros, I\nbelieve, come from the factory encrypted.\n\n399\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.800\nAnd when you first turn them on,\n\n400\n00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.480\nthey ask you if you wanna store your key\nin the Cloud or in Active Directory.\n\n401\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.120\nSo if your machine joins the domain it\nwill actually store that key in your\n\n402\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.950\nprofile in Active Directory so\nthat if you get hit by a truck or\n\n403\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.180\nsomething and the company needs to decrypt\nyour hard drive they can get access to it.\n\n404\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.080\nOr you can store it in the Cloud in\nthe event that something happens in\n\n405\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.160\nthe machine and you have to restore,\npull your data down and\n\n406\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.880\nyou need the key to be\nable to decrypt your data.\n\n407\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.750\n>> They also have a recovery agent.\n\n408\n00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.700\n>> Correct that if all worst case\nscenario nobody can get at the at your\n\n409\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.720\nkey they can use the recovery agent\nto get to it as well I believe?\n\n410\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.130\n>> I don't think anymore they can't.\n\n411\n00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.970\n>> Really?\n>> Not Windows 10 no.\n\n412\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.510\n>> They took away that?\n\n413\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.010\n>> Yeah I don't.\n>> Okay.\n\n414\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.790\n>> I don't think that they\n\n415\n00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.410\ncan do that it's.\n\n416\n00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.400\n>> They're really locking it down.\n\n417\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.740\n>> Well very much like Apple.\n\n418\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.643\n>> Okay.\n>> You know it's like\n\n419\n00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:13.050\nonce you create the key it's yours.\n\n420\n00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.230\n>> It's done?\n>> We're not gonna\n\n421\n00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.009\nyeah we're not gonna poke\nour nose in that anymore.\n\n422\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.940\nSo, TPM was the last module that\nI wanted to wrap things up with.\n\n423\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.860\nI think this is gonna conclude our series.\n\n424\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.130\nWe've finished up domain five.\n\n425\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.400\nThis was episode six.\n\n426\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.460\n>> Six.\n>> Six of five.\n\n427\n00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.490\n>> Six of five.\n\n428\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.780\n>> So, I wanna say thanks to ITPro TV and\neverybody here.\n\n429\n00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.390\nI wish you all the best on the exam,\nplease email me or\n\n430\n00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.650\nlet me know if you have questions.\n\n431\n00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.430\nIf I can answer them I will.\n\n432\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.570\nI won't answer specific questions\nabout exam questions but\n\n433\n00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:50.620\nI will be glad to help you out with any\ntopics you might have trouble with.\n\n434\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.810\nMy email and Twitter feed are both\nlisted I believe on the website.\n\n435\n00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.800\nAnd the videos will be posted,\nI think they said Monday.\n\n436\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.300\n>> Very soon, yes.\n\n437\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.310\n>> 48 hours or something like that.\n\n438\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.990\n>> Yeah, usually within just a few days.\n\n439\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.740\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> Just give us a little time to get those\n\n440\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.600\nthings wrapped up, edited, and\nput a nice little bow on top of it, right?\n\n441\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.030\n>> Yeah, so\nI wish you all the best of luck and\n\n442\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.470\nI hope to see you here\non ITProTV again soon.\n\n443\n00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.410\n>> Well Brian, it has been a, a pleasure.\n\n444\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.280\nHaving you on,\nyou're a plethora of knowledge and\n\n445\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.560\nwe appreciate you sharing that knowledge\nwith us so that we might partake of\n\n446\n00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.590\nthe CISA certification and\nbecome great auditors one day ourselves.\n\n447\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.150\nThat being said, don't forget to\ngrab a copy of the CISA study guide,\n\n448\n00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.140\nfourth edition.\n\n449\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.280\nThat's our good friend Mr.\nBrian O'Hara here has so kindly lent his\n\n450\n00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.200\nmassive experience and dedication to as an\nauthoring, or being one of the authors of.\n\n451\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.650\nAnd that being said, we are at the end of\nthis series, at the end of the show and\n\n452\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.840\nwe do thank you for watching.\n\n453\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.960\nHopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n454\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.620\nWe're signing off for IT Pro TV.\n\n455\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.271\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n456\n00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:52.830\n>> And I'm Brian O'Hara.\n\n457\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.720\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n458\n00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.842\n>> Almost forgot.\n\n459\n00:26:55.842 --> 00:27:03.470\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
