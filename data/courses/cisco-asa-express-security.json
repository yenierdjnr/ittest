Cisco ASA\nExpress Security course here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120\nNow if you're not familiar with\nASA Express Security, well,\n\n5\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.490\nit's really referring to the firewall\nproduct line that comes from Cisco.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.570\nAnd they don't like to call them firewalls\nanymore, they call them adaptive security\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.096\nappliances because they can do so\nmany different things.\n\n8\n00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.140\nAnd the ASA Express Security course is\na great one because it gives you a high\n\n9\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.810\nlevel view of all the crazy features\nthat are available inside of ASAs and\n\n10\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.320\nsome of the different things\nthat we can do with it.\n\n11\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.730\nIt's a really neat course.\n\n12\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.680\nI know I'm excited about it, not just\nbecause it's a good course, but because\n\n13\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.520\nI've got a very special friend here in\nthe studio to help us go through and\n\n14\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.450\nlearn about all this.\n\n15\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.040\nWe've got Cisco book author and all around\nknowledgable Cisco guy, Todd Lindley,\n\n16\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.090\nhere in the studios with us.\n\n17\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.120\nTodd, thanks for being here.\n\n18\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.560\n>> It's great to be here.\n\n19\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.130\nSo, what made me wanna come back to\nthe studio, cuz we had just done FirePOWER\n\n20\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.290\nbased on when my book came out,\nright, the FirePOWER.\n\n21\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.380\nSo we're gonna cover that.\n\n22\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.320\nBut we already have a course on that and\na full, detailed course.\n\n23\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.770\nBut I got a lot of calls from\nCisco partners and reps.\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.160\nAnd they were saying, hey, we've got\nto get certified on a certain test,\n\n25\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.420\nthe Cisco ASA Express Security 500-260,\nto be able to sell with the FirePOWER.\n\n26\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.470\nSo not a lot of people were\nable to teach FirePOWER today.\n\n27\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.660\nSo getting the pods and the curriculum and\nall of that, so I've got that capability.\n\n28\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.380\nSo I've been doing a lot with that and I\nthought I need to add this as a supplement\n\n29\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.630\nto the course ware and to the book and\nto our existing course.\n\n30\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.970\nLet's, because on that course we did\nthere, Don, it was a very great course.\n\n31\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.020\nExtreme detail of FirePOWER, best video\ncourse in the world, I think, right?\n\n32\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.502\n>> It was very technical too.\n\n33\n00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.330\nIt's like if you hadn't worked with ASAs,\nand\n\n34\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.310\nyou went right into that FirePOWER course,\nyou'd get over your head pretty quickly,\n\n35\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.460\nso it's pretty obvious that we needed\nsome kind of middle ground in between,\n\n36\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.840\nwhat would consider like a-\n>> Stepping stone approach.\n\n37\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.530\nSo we can take a stepping\nstone approach and\n\n38\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.500\nconfigure the ASAs,\nstart at the beginning.\n\n39\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.120\nAnd we're gonna act like you've\nnever seen an ASA before, right,\n\n40\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.940\nwe're gonna talk about naming\nan interface cuz we gotta name it.\n\n41\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420\nWe're gonna create objects, the access\nlist, but one of the things you and\n\n42\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.370\nI were having a conversation about.\n\n43\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.600\nYeah, we're starting at the beginning with\nthe ASA, but we have some pre-requisite\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890\nknowledge base that we think you should\nhave, and I'll let you go into that.\n\n45\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.350\n>> Sure, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.100\nIf you've worked with firewalls a lot,\nthen you may not even need this.\n\n47\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.640\nYou may be able to jump\nright into FirePOWER, but\n\n48\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.220\nif you've never worked with them, you've\ngotta get into that initial configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.393\nAnd that's where we kick things off,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:31.700\nWe're just getting things\nset up like that, but\n\n51\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.851\nwe're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime on fundamentals and theories,\n\n52\n00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.570\nthings like IP subnetting or\nbasic routing principles.\n\n53\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.880\nAnd those are things that they would\nkind of expect you to already have.\n\n54\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.340\nSo a lot of the people that are gonna\nwatch this course are people that have\n\n55\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.300\nalready been through like a CCENT or\n\n56\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.310\na CCNA that at least have that\nbasic knowledge in place.\n\n57\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.930\nTo then be able to take it and\n\n58\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.990\napply it to the firewalls because a lot\nof these concepts aren't new, right?\n\n59\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.080\nAccess control list,\nthat's not a new concept,\n\n60\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.550\nyou've probably seen it in routers.\n\n61\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.680\nNow we're gonna see it in firewalls.\n\n62\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.210\nAnd it's really just\na different set of commands.\n\n63\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.890\n>> Right, so\nwe're gonna see in the new code and\n\n64\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.850\nhow we do access control lists,\nwe're not gonna go into it.\n\n65\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.000\nYou're gonna understand that hey,\nat the end of this access control list,\n\n66\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.700\nthere is a permit IP, or\ndeny IP any any, right?\n\n67\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.410\nSo, we're not gonna mention that,\nwe're gonna assume things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.420\nWe're not gonna go into\nany routing protocols.\n\n69\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.800\nI'll do some static routing on the ASAs\njust for my little network here, but\n\n70\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.710\nalso NAT, I think, and VPNs,\nright, something outside the CCNA.\n\n71\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.040\nSo we're still gonna assume you have\na CCNA level access or knowledge of NAT.\n\n72\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.714\nAnd we're gonna talk about how it's done\non the new code, it's called Object now or\n\n73\n00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:39.800\nObNAT, very cool, very cool stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.300\n>> All right, well, we've talked about\nthe knowledge we expect them to have.\n\n75\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.483\nLet's talk a little about the knowledge\nthat we're gonna give them, right?\n\n76\n00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:45.360\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n77\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.800\nlet's take a look at that outline and\nsee some of the things we're gonna cover.\n\n78\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.435\n>> All right.\n\n79\n00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:52.765\nSo, again, so\nwe got the Express Security 500-260.\n\n80\n00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.285\nAnd we're gonna kind of focus\non those objectives, and\n\n81\n00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:58.565\nwe're going to get into here's an ASA,\nlet's start at the beginning.\n\n82\n00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:01.655\nCuz we're talking about security levels\non the interface, stuff like that.\n\n83\n00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:05.805\nAnd so it's the 500-260 exam,\nis the objectives that we're covering.\n\n84\n00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:11.370\nAnd we're gonna also talk about FirePOWER,\nbut we're not gonna go in as much detail\n\n85\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.650\nas we did in the actual FirePOWER class,\ncuz we don't need to for these objectives.\n\n86\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.330\nHowever, by the end of this course,\nyou'll take an ASA out of the box,\n\n87\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.080\nconfigure it for your network,\ninstall FirePOWER, put policies on, and\n\n88\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.590\nput it into production network.\n\n89\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.680\nThat's our goal by the end of this course.\n\n90\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.350\nSo we have an introduction ASA,\nwhat they are, talk about the products and\n\n91\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.180\nthe licensing and\nhigh availability, and so on.\n\n92\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.340\nInitial configuration is when we get\ninto the IP interfaces, the naming\n\n93\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.090\nand security levels, and\nthen we talk about ACLs,\n\n94\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.470\nand how they're a little bit simpler,\nI think, than an iOS, actually.\n\n95\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.360\nAnd then the nuggets is the same as NAT,\nbut we talk about how we create objects.\n\n96\n00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.130\nWe'll demonstrate creating objects and\nhow those are used within a NAT statement.\n\n97\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.500\nIt's also refered to auto-NAT.\n\n98\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.670\nAll right now, one of the things\nis as we go through this,\n\n99\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.910\nwe're gonna go through quite\na few episodes before.\n\n100\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.222\nYou know on the Command Line and\n\n101\n00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:10.160\nthen we're gonna get into something called\nASDM, which is the GUI that we use today.\n\n102\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.720\nThat's certainly changing this year,\n\n103\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.880\nwe're gonna get a new GUI to configure\nthe ASA and FirePOWER all in one, right?\n\n104\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.320\nSo we're gonna see that\ncoming out shortly.\n\n105\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.000\nBut this is going to cover the ASDM.\n\n106\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.980\nAnd we're gonna see that,\nwe're gonna kinda walk through that.\n\n107\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.500\nI don't use it very much,\n\n108\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.270\nso I'm gonna probably be looking around\na little bit as we're going through there.\n\n109\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.810\nBut the section after that is the VPNs,\nand\n\n110\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.270\nthat's where I do a lot of ASTM because\nit does all this work for you in there.\n\n111\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.510\nAnd VPNs can be extremely detailed.\n\n112\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.816\nSo that's when we use ASDM,\nbut before that,\n\n113\n00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:43.700\npretty much everything\nelse is done from the CLI.\n\n114\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.600\nAfter that, we're gonna get into\nthe FirePOWER and talk about what,\n\n115\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.930\nwhen you get an ASA, how do I make\nthe FirePOWER module come up and\n\n116\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.720\nhow do I create policies and\nwe'll go through the different policies,\n\n117\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.530\nthe file policy, IPS store policy,\nand the access control policy.\n\n118\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.850\nAnd that's kind of our\ngoal with this course,\n\n119\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.644\nto follow along with the exam objectives.\n\n120\n00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:05.180\n>> Yeah, so key thing to remember here\nis that we're gonna spend some good time\n\n121\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.750\ntalking about FirePOWER, it's a very\npowerful, very advanced feature.\n\n122\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.450\nAnd if you're just starting\nout with this show,\n\n123\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.650\nthen you're gonna get a chance\nto see what it can do.\n\n124\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.885\nBut if you really wanna dig into\nthe nitty gritty details and\n\n125\n00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.075\nsee all the things that source fire\ncan do, remember that we've already\n\n126\n00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:22.355\nfilmed a Sourcefire series and\nyou can jump right over and watch that.\n\n127\n00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.195\nIf you've never worked\nwith a firewall before,\n\n128\n00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:26.940\nI don't recommend you jumping\nright into that other course.\n\n129\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.450\nWatch this one first, and\nthen you'll be set up and\n\n130\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.901\nready to jump into the other one and\nbe a success.\n\n131\n00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.494\n>> Right, cuz we're gonna introduce the\nFirePOWER module and we do it there, but\n\n132\n00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:36.710\nI'm still gonna do more of a high\nlevel overview on this one.\n\n133\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.344\nBut we're gonna stop using\nthe word Sourcefire.\n\n134\n00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:39.800\n[LAUGH], all right, so.\n\n135\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.080\n>> You gotta say FirePOWER.\n\n136\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.890\n>> The name, yeah,\nby the time you're watching this,\n\n137\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.510\nwhenever you're watching this, Cisco's\njust renaming this thing FirePOWER, right,\n\n138\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.830\nso it's just FirePOWER.\n\n139\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.250\nAnd so Sourcefire's gone,\nthat was the company they bought.\n\n140\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.258\nSo we'll talk about that in a bit\nwhen we get to that episode.\n\n141\n00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:56.888\n>> All right, so once we've moved\nthrough FirePOWER, we get, I mean,\n\n142\n00:06:56.888 --> 00:06:58.011\nno, I got it right this time.\n\n143\n00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.693\nShoot, I got [CROSSTALK]\n>> You did!\n\n144\n00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:03.420\n>> So once we get through FirePOWER,\nit's been Sourcefire for so long.\n\n145\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.790\nOnce we get through that,\nwe get a high level view of what it does,\n\n146\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.880\nwe move through that,\nwe see it, we're successful.\n\n147\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.690\nWe're ready to basically go back into\nour organization, and at a minimum,\n\n148\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.050\nbe able to take an ASA out of the box,\nturn it on, get it filtering traffic, and\n\n149\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.270\nget FirePOWER enabled and up and running.\n\n150\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.120\n>> Yeah and one of the approaches that I\nwanna take here is obviously, I had so\n\n151\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.440\nmany calls about this exam that\nI wanted to focus on that.\n\n152\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.570\nSo I called this guy and say,\nhey, I'm doing all these classes.\n\n153\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.020\nLet me come down there and film this as\na supplement for those courses, and again,\n\n154\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.918\nyou're gonna use the other\nFirePOWER training for\n\n155\n00:07:33.918 --> 00:07:36.590\nif you're in production\nas a supplement for that.\n\n156\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.870\nIn this case here, we remember that\nthe very beginning, if you've already\n\n157\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.660\nconfigured ASAs for many years, then this\ncourse, the beginning of it isn't for you.\n\n158\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.400\nYou just go over to the FirePOWER course.\n\n159\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.300\nThis is geared toward someone I\nhaven't really seen in ASA course.\n\n160\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.740\nI don't see a lot of ASAs where they start\nat the beginning like we're gonna start.\n\n161\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.190\nAnd then configure it all\nthe way through to FirePOWER and\n\n162\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.500\nputting it into production.\n\n163\n00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.350\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\nstep by step by step by step.\n\n164\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.340\n>> All right well,\nif all that sounds interesting to you,\n\n165\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.520\nI know it sounds interesting to me,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n166\n00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.550\nStay tuned, those episodes are coming up.\n\n167\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.910\nIf it doesn't sound interesting to you,\n\n168\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.770\nif it sounds like it's a little\nover your head, don't worry.\n\n169\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.180\nWe've got the CCENT,\n\n170\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.090\nCCNA training that kinda serves as\nthat foundation available on the site.\n\n171\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.640\nYou can jump right over and\nstart to watch that,\n\n172\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.010\nand then jump back over\nhere when you're ready.\n\n173\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.943\nBut for those of you who are sticking\nwith us, stay tuned because we've got\n\n174\n00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:26.872\nour Cisco ASA Express Security\nshows coming up after this.\n\n175\n00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:34.854\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.755\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:22.210\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again\nwith another episode of Cisco ASA\n\n5\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.546\nexpress security.\n\n6\n00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:26.311\nHere in the studios to help us out,\nI've got Mr. Todd Lammle with me.\n\n7\n00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.110\nTodd, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.600\n>> Great, it's good to be back,\n\n9\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.290\nand had so much fun last time\nI couldn't wait to come back.\n\n10\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.900\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and move straight\nfrom here into initialization of ASA,\n\n11\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.330\nthe adaptive security appliance so\nstay with me.\n\n12\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.090\nI'm gonna go through a couple slides,\njust a few here.\n\n13\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.260\nI know we had gone some on the intro,\n\n14\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.650\nbut in this case here I'm going to\ndo a couple foundational slides, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.020\nthen Don and I are going to get right into\nan ASA, start right from the beginning and\n\n16\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.400\nspend some time like, you got an ASA,\nhow do we configure it?\n\n17\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.560\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.690\nSo now, if I look at my slides here, so\nI'm at basically introduction to ASA.\n\n19\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.840\nThe product line is very\nimportant today and\n\n20\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.290\nhere's one of the things\nthat changes constantly.\n\n21\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.000\nSo if I come over here and look at,\n\n22\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.580\nif I can get into, there we go,\nand you know I just typed in the,\n\n23\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.890\nI don't know how well you can see this,\nbut let me click on this.\n\n24\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.337\nThe ASA firewalls is obviously let's\ntalk about this part for a second here.\n\n25\n00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:27.422\nThis is our new X series\nI guess we'll call them.\n\n26\n00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:31.805\nSo they go from a 5506 that replaced\n5505 all the way to a 5585,\n\n27\n00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.046\nand they have the new ones coming out.\n\n28\n00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:35.504\nWhat is it the 9000s?\n\n29\n00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.671\nI need to look that back\nup because I forget.\n\n30\n00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.140\nThere's a new ASA that's pretty awesome.\n\n31\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840\nI'll bring that up later.\n\n32\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.780\nSo, the X series here is what\nwe're gonna concentrate on.\n\n33\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.970\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at what they have here.\n\n34\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.730\nSo, I'm gonna say compare models,\nso just ASA models.\n\n35\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.310\nAnd there's so much information on here.\n\n36\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.190\nSo, they did a really great job.\n\n37\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.005\nI don't always say that about Cisco, but\nin this case here, [LAUGH] I really don't.\n\n38\n00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:07.129\nThey have [LAUGH] the 5500, we're not,\nwe're not gonna pay attention to that.\n\n39\n00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.713\nIf you have a 55 or 100, put it on eBay\nand get rid of it as soon as you can.\n\n40\n00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.480\n5506-X, right, that's what you wanna do.\n\n41\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760\nThat's my minimum.\n\n42\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.950\nNow, here's what I wanna tell you,\nis I work with all the different models.\n\n43\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.270\nI go out and I put them into customers and\nthen [COUGH] whatever the spec sheets say,\n\n44\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.500\nif they say, okay, if you have like\n25 people or something like that.\n\n45\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.253\nJust always kinda cut those in half.\n\n46\n00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:31.665\nThat way you know that you're always\ngetting the bandwidth that you need,\n\n47\n00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:32.629\nall right, very important.\n\n48\n00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.671\n55O6W, very cool cuz this\nis kinda a SOHO product.\n\n49\n00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:37.870\nSo a lower end model.\n\n50\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.171\nWorks very well.\nIt's what we're using in here.\n\n51\n00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.337\nThey work very well for\ntraining and very small companies.\n\n52\n00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:45.290\nSo you know,\n15-20 people might be pushing it.\n\n53\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.500\nDepending on how much like you're doing\nURL filtering and the amp, and whatever.\n\n54\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.740\nAnyways, so\nwe can see that this is a hardware base,\n\n55\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.610\nin an outside environment they have the H,\nnice.\n\n56\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.710\nSo, we wanna go up, and\nyou're like well I want the 5506 and\n\n57\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.880\nI don't have a lot of money, but\nwe're gonna go the 5508, awesome product.\n\n58\n00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.800\nThe processing speed, I think,\nis better than the old 5512, and so\n\n59\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.620\nyou can see that they have the 5512-X now.\n\n60\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.740\nAnd the 55, you don't want the 15s\nanymore, cuz they have the 16s and\n\n61\n00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.410\nthen we come back up and\nhit to the 5555s, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.440\nSo, if you wanna do it you can compare\nthese, so like we can click on this and\n\n63\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.620\ncompare and\nunderstand what is this guy giving me,\n\n64\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.600\nwhat's his processing,\nwhat's his memory and stuff like that.\n\n65\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.730\nAnd this, it's important to understand\nthese when you're out there looking.\n\n66\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.230\nDon't just trust yourselves when\nthey give you the best product.\n\n67\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.270\nMake sure you do your\nown research on that.\n\n68\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.890\nAll right, so let's come back in here for\na second and one of the things is,\n\n69\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.020\nwe were talking about the product line,\n\n70\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.270\nthey do come in just a huge range and\nif you, 5585 which can give\n\n71\n00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.440\nus 600 gig through put if we have a bunch\nof them together, we're staking them.\n\n72\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.588\nThe new ASA that is coming out\nis going to be like twice that.\n\n73\n00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:02.962\nAll right with range resize and\ntwice the money [LAUGH].\n\n74\n00:04:02.962 --> 00:04:05.879\nSo with a new model number then\nwe're going to get more money.\n\n75\n00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.330\nAll right, so\nwe're talking some visibility and control.\n\n76\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.740\nThe ASA, they also refer to it\nas the next generation firewall,\n\n77\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.119\nthe next generation IPS.\n\n78\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.620\nSo the one thing is that's always\nbeen kind of a problem here and\n\n79\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560\nI won't just go full screen on this.\n\n80\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.950\nThe licensing used to be really simple,\nin most things let's us go dead, but\n\n81\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.720\nthey fixed that problem in and now it's\nquite complex especially for the ASA.\n\n82\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.980\nSo really pay attention to what your\nbuying and your licensing and so,\n\n83\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.270\nif you're studying for\nthe exam objectives that we talked about,\n\n84\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.050\nwe do have to understand\nhigh availability.\n\n85\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.480\nNow high availability,\n\n86\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.880\nyou know when you see that in all\nproducts from all manufacturers.\n\n87\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.830\nWhere we have multiple products and\nyou know with one on standby.\n\n88\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.540\nSo, do you know how many\nwe can have with the ASA?\n\n89\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.330\n>> At least two.\n\n90\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.220\n>> Yeah, at least two.\n\n91\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.762\nI guarantee it is at least two.\n\n92\n00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.337\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, well so\nit depends on how much money you have.\n\n93\n00:04:58.337 --> 00:04:59.730\nIt always comes down to that,\nbut up to 16.\n\n94\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.290\nSo that gives us a huge amount of\nthroughput in a lot of the abilities.\n\n95\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.230\nSo I can have eight active ASAs.\n\n96\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.410\nSo what we can't have now, with the next\ngeneration firewall, is the active active.\n\n97\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.580\nThat's really what we want and this is\na point of contention I brought up.\n\n98\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.870\nWhen I was doing my last series was that\n\n99\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.830\nwe couldn't have active active when\nit came to the fire power module.\n\n100\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.410\nWell they're going to fix that this year,\nshortly.\n\n101\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.920\nAnd also allow us to have\nactive active on that.\n\n102\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.320\nSo that's an upgrade because what was\nhappening is you had to buy the firewall\n\n103\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.314\nand you had to buy the licences for\nthe fire power and never use the one,\n\n104\n00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:42.039\nright unless the other one went down so\nyou buy the full licence but\n\n105\n00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.711\nthey're going to fix\nthat finally this year.\n\n106\n00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.504\nSo, coming up soon.\n\n107\n00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:50.820\n>> This is something that a lot of\ncompanies bump into is well maybe\n\n108\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.330\nyou don't want to upgrade.\n\n109\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.170\nMaybe you've got 5505s or\n\n110\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.498\n5525s and you're happy with and\nyou're light why would I upgrade.\n\n111\n00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:59.810\nAnd the -x,\nthat let's us know it's the new model and\n\n112\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.870\nit introduces things like fire power.\n\n113\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.640\nAnd it kinda goes back to, remember how\nit used to be the Cisco picks firewalls.\n\n114\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.390\nIt was just a firewall.\n\n115\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then they started adding\n\n116\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.050\nfeature after feature after feature.\n\n117\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.420\nAnd they did so many things,\nthey said, you know what?\n\n118\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.590\nLet's change it and make them\nadaptive security appliances instead.\n\n119\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.030\nThey can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.160\nIt takes processor power,\n\n121\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.460\nit takes memory to do that, that's why\nwe need these higher hardware models.\n\n122\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.300\nAll the x models have\nthe upgraded hardware, and\n\n123\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.560\nyou've gotta pay for the license.\n\n124\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.550\nJust because it's an x model, doesn't\nmean you get all the bells and whistles.\n\n125\n00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.690\nSo you do have to do a little\nresearch before you buy.\n\n126\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.370\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n127\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.350\nEverything is absolutely separate.\n\n128\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.040\nSo make sure that you pick\nthe right licenses, and\n\n129\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.850\nthat your sales person is,\nthere's some licenses that are free.\n\n130\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.650\nIf you buy the FirePOWER module,\nyou'll get the control and\n\n131\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.250\nprotect licenses, and\nwe'll go through those.\n\n132\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.560\nBut you have to put those as a line item.\n\n133\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.270\nIn other words, you don't just get them.\n\n134\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.860\nYou have to order them,\neven though there's no cost.\n\n135\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.850\nThose are the kind of\nexamples of what I mean.\n\n136\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.380\nMake sure that everything is being\nordered correctly, all right.\n\n137\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.560\nNow we have Cisco loves their\ntime base licenses now and\n\n138\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.070\nthis is no different on here.\n\n139\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.740\nSo we can put multiple license time base,\nbut only one can be active.\n\n140\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.930\nNow why am I saying that?\n\n141\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.060\nRemember we're studying for\na particular exam.\n\n142\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.480\nSo that's very important so\nwe look at time base licensers,\n\n143\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.770\nstack one duration, but not in capacity.\n\n144\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:21.290\nFor example, if I had 30,000 user for\nany connect and I had a lower one.\n\n145\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.120\nI upgraded the 30,000 one.\n\n146\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.840\nI'd have to deactivate the first\none to make the second one active.\n\n147\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.990\nOkay, so you gotta remember\nthat we can stack them but\n\n148\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.700\nonly one will be active, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.680\nImportant exam objective.\n\n150\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.630\n>> And so some examples of things that are\nlicensed or features like your firepower\n\n151\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.680\nsubscription, how many [INAUDIBLE]\nconnections you can have.\n\n152\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.930\nWe've got other things,\nlike how many vlans you can support,\n\n153\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.140\nespecially in the lower end models,\nlike the 5506.\n\n154\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.317\nI think and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here, Tom,\n\n155\n00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:51.019\nbut I think the base license supports five\nvlans, but if you want more than that,\n\n156\n00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.426\nyou've got to step up to\nthe security plus license.\n\n157\n00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:54.066\n>> Right.\n\n158\n00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:56.898\n>> So just be aware of those and\nmake sure that you purchase the right one.\n\n159\n00:07:56.898 --> 00:07:59.168\nAnd if something's not\nworking the way you expect.\n\n160\n00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:01.048\nIt may be that you don't\nhave the right license.\n\n161\n00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:02.308\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n162\n00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:03.708\nAnd so we see that all the time.\n\n163\n00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:07.402\nYou go in there and you type in failover\nto enable the failover, and it says,\n\n164\n00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.270\nyou don't have the license, right?\n\n165\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.150\nSo you're like, this is time,\nit's a time sucker.\n\n166\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.300\nLicensing is hard.\n\n167\n00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.589\nSo, let's take a look at\nmy slides real quick here.\n\n168\n00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:19.965\nWe had the CX model,\ncontent aware module, right?\n\n169\n00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:26.400\nThis was kind of Cisco's attempt at IPS\nand being application aware and so on.\n\n170\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.200\nObviously they did a lot better with the\nfirePOWER and by purchasing Sourcefire.\n\n171\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.820\nAnd so in the 5585,\nwe're seeing here that this is a module.\n\n172\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.520\nIt's called the SSP, right?\n\n173\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.860\nSo basically this allows us\nto just put this card in,\n\n174\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.590\nit makes it pretty simple to upgrade.\n\n175\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.960\nOn the 55O axis that we use,\n\n176\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.030\nit's all a software upgrade,\nwhere that's a hardware upgrade.\n\n177\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.230\nNow, they use something\nelse also that's available.\n\n178\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.160\nAnd sometimes guys,\n\n179\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.430\nit gets a little confusing because you've\ngot different appliances out there.\n\n180\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.810\nAnd Cisco comes and I'm out there and\nI'm working with sales and\n\n181\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.610\nI'm dong some stuff for them.\n\n182\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:08.470\nAnd I'm saying, you don't need\nthe siloed approach to security,\n\n183\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.670\nwhere you have one appliance\non top of another.\n\n184\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.622\nAnd that sounds awesome because I can just\ntake now the ACA out the FirePOWER module\n\n185\n00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:16.638\nand I get my IPS.\n\n186\n00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:17.547\nI get my malware.\n\n187\n00:09:17.547 --> 00:09:19.256\nI get URL filtering.\n\n188\n00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:21.297\nProtecting control visibility.\n\n189\n00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:23.131\nFireSIGHT.\n\n190\n00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.510\nWhich we'll all talk about.\n\n191\n00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.380\nOkay, so that's all great and good, but\n\n192\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.470\nit does most things really,\nreally well, but not everything.\n\n193\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.100\nFor example, if we go through\nthe URL filter, it's okay.\n\n194\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.865\nIt's good.\nIt's probably good enough for\n\n195\n00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:38.589\nmost people and most companies.\n\n196\n00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:42.808\nHowever, there was a job I was just doing\nnot too long ago, it wasn't good enough,\n\n197\n00:09:42.808 --> 00:09:45.870\nand we had to go something else\nlike this cloud web service.\n\n198\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.006\nSo, CWS.\n\n199\n00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:49.430\nAnd again, I'm bringing this up for\ntwo reasons.\n\n200\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.703\nOne, I went out there,\n\n201\n00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:55.047\nI had to add another appliance in with\nthis customer to fit their business needs.\n\n202\n00:09:55.047 --> 00:10:00.047\nBut the other thing is that\nit's an exam objective as well.\n\n203\n00:10:00.047 --> 00:10:01.674\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\n\n204\n00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:02.507\ntake a look at that.\n\n205\n00:10:02.507 --> 00:10:05.520\nCuz I might glance by it if it\nwasn't an exam and say hey,\n\n206\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.460\nthere's more than one appliance.\n\n207\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.860\nI know we're gonna push FirePower a lot\ncuz that's half the exam objectives,\n\n208\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.680\nbut they mention CWS.\n\n209\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.714\nSo, it's more of a web proxy.\n\n210\n00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:22.796\nSo it's a bit different than FirePOWER.\n\n211\n00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:25.608\nWith FirePOWER I can do URL filtering and\n\n212\n00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:29.088\nI can block people going to Facebook or\nwhatever.\n\n213\n00:10:29.088 --> 00:10:32.723\nOr I can do an interactive block, which\nsays, okay, you're not supposed to go\n\n214\n00:10:32.723 --> 00:10:36.200\nthere but we're gonna let you cuz\nyou're on break, or whatever.\n\n215\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.480\nAnd we allow them to, and we log it.\n\n216\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.540\nBut we can't stop them or\nhave them enter a password.\n\n217\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.548\nAnd that's what some\nof the customers want.\n\n218\n00:10:44.548 --> 00:10:47.160\nI don't want you to go to this website,\nbut I'm the administrator and\n\n219\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.589\nif I wanna go there, I get to go there.\n\n220\n00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:51.190\nSo, I wanted just\na password to override it.\n\n221\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.860\nSo I see that a lot with some customers.\n\n222\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.225\nNow, there's some certain\nthings we can do,\n\n223\n00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:56.760\nin what's called the access\ncontrol policy, that allow\n\n224\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.670\nus to do something similar to that, but\nit's not as good as the CWS in that.\n\n225\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.089\nSo, it's something you\nmight wanna keep in mind.\n\n226\n00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:06.852\nThat there is a lot of overlap\nbetween these other appliances,\n\n227\n00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:08.631\nwhich kinda drives me crazy.\n\n228\n00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:13.047\nSo I go to my customer and say, hey,\nno you want this ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n229\n00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.300\nIt's gonna change your life,\n[LAUGH] it's awesome.\n\n230\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.300\nDon't forget, now we need to buy CWS.\n\n231\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.430\nSo, they'd get a little frustrated.\n\n232\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.060\nAnd they both talk to what's called\nTalos or the Cisco AMP cloud, right?\n\n233\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.900\nAnd so they both do the same thing.\n\n234\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.270\nSo, this does just a little bit\nmore in-depth on the web filtering.\n\n235\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.370\nSo, if that's really so important to you,\n\n236\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.960\nthen the FirePOWER probably\ndoes it very well.\n\n237\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.781\nIt's probably good enough for\nmost of my customers, but\n\n238\n00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:38.797\nCWS is something you wanna keep in mind.\n\n239\n00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:41.552\n>> And CWS, they've got some curated\nwebsite lists and things, so\n\n240\n00:11:41.552 --> 00:11:43.606\nit can actually replace\nthings like Websense and\n\n241\n00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:45.882\nsome of the other filters\nthat are out there, right?\n\n242\n00:11:45.882 --> 00:11:46.410\n>> It does.\n\n243\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.920\nThat's exactly what it was for.\n\n244\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.798\nSo, it's just that last time I\nthink when I was here, I was like,\n\n245\n00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:55.130\nhey you need to get rid of\nall your screening/ devices.\n\n246\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.721\nAnd I walk in here and say, well,\nyou gotta get rid of most of them but\n\n247\n00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:03.150\nyou need to devise something else new too,\nso that's just the way it is.\n\n248\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.450\nSo, the next generation firewall\nthough is something that we\n\n249\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.040\nreally wanna paid attention too on Cisco,\nthey really got an advantage here.\n\n250\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.480\nAnd what does that advantage come down to?\n\n251\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.940\nBecause I talk to people and\npeople are like, well,\n\n252\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.530\nyou're very excited about FirePOWER.\n\n253\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.670\nWe love your enthusiasm,\ncome and tell us about it.\n\n254\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.266\nAnd then I get calls from people going,\nman we use Palo Alto or they are from\n\n255\n00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:27.696\nPalo Alto [LAUGH] or something, and\nthey're like, we can do all that.\n\n256\n00:12:27.696 --> 00:12:29.270\nAnd it's true.\n\n257\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.750\nI'm not gonna sit here and pick on\nPaul Alto because they're just another\n\n258\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.890\ncompany and\nthey're doing some great stuff.\n\n259\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.120\nThe issue is that they have\nreally the siloed approach to\n\n260\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.630\nnetwork management when\nit comes to security.\n\n261\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.620\nThe second issue is the management\nadministration itself,\n\n262\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.797\nthe multiple screens.\n\n263\n00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:49.472\nRight now today we have two\nmanagement screens with the ASA,\n\n264\n00:12:49.472 --> 00:12:51.131\nwith the ASDM or CSM.\n\n265\n00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:54.422\nAnd then the FirePOWER management center,\nFireSIGHT, whatever.\n\n266\n00:12:54.422 --> 00:13:00.589\nSo the point is, I have two that's gonna\nbecome one here in just a few more weeks.\n\n267\n00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:05.839\nAnd then by June of 2016,\nwe're gonna have this one interface.\n\n268\n00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:07.647\nSo if you're watching\nthis past June of 2016,\n\n269\n00:13:07.647 --> 00:13:10.690\nwe definitely are gonna have a different\ninterface than I'm gonna show you today.\n\n270\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.047\nBut it's gonna do the same thing.\n\n271\n00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:16.383\nSo that's gonna change the industry\nbecause when we get to McAfee and IBM and\n\n272\n00:13:16.383 --> 00:13:19.470\nso on and just so\nmany different management screens.\n\n273\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.200\nAnd you don't get correlation between\nevents with next generation firewall\n\n274\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.460\nlike we do with Cisco.\n\n275\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.172\nSo, I'm not gonna sit here and\ntry to be a cheerleader for Cisco.\n\n276\n00:13:28.172 --> 00:13:29.660\nThis is the facts.\n\n277\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.464\nThey have a great product and\nwith great management.\n\n278\n00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:34.450\nYou can't beat it.\n\n279\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.991\n>> And I think a lot of organizations\nare starting to realize how important\n\n280\n00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:38.881\ncorrelation is.\n\n281\n00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:42.800\nThat certain types of traffic on your\nfirewall might not look like an attack, or\n\n282\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.150\non your router,\nmight not look like an attack.\n\n283\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.172\nBut when you put the two together,\nit becomes apparent that it is an attack.\n\n284\n00:13:48.172 --> 00:13:51.505\nAnd so you need those devices\ncommunicating, sharing that information.\n\n285\n00:13:51.505 --> 00:13:54.030\nAnd services like Talos,\nwhere it's being uploaded.\n\n286\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.860\nCisco is monitoring in realtime with up\nto date, not just virus signatures, but\n\n287\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.230\nbehavioral aspects and stuff.\n\n288\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.716\nIt's a powerful feature.\n\n289\n00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:05.921\nAnd with the way that advanced\nattacks are evolving,\n\n290\n00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:11.631\non a minute-by-minute basis,\nit's really a critical thing to have.\n\n291\n00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:15.413\n>> And the other thing about having\na single management, where we get all our\n\n292\n00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:19.770\npolicies in one and our event reporting\nin one, is the retrospect of analysis.\n\n293\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.150\nAnd that's really what the power that\nit can blow away any competition is,\n\n294\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.250\nI have the technology to go back and\nlook at as far back as I can go.\n\n295\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.744\nAnd look at what happened\nin this event last time and\n\n296\n00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.256\nmake decisions based on that.\n\n297\n00:14:32.256 --> 00:14:34.222\nYou can't do that with any other product,\nokay?\n\n298\n00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:37.764\nSo, [LAUGH] I mentioned in the last one,\nyou're like, man, that guy,\n\n299\n00:14:37.764 --> 00:14:39.797\nhe be getting paid a lot from Cisco-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:41.070\n>> He works at Cisco.\n\n301\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.089\nI do not speak for Cisco.\n\n302\n00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:42.881\nI do not work for Cisco.\n\n303\n00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.256\nI don't get paid from Cisco.\n\n304\n00:14:44.256 --> 00:14:47.580\nSo, I just gotta say that cuz I'm sitting\nhere saying, Cisco, Cisco, Cisco.\n\n305\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.422\nBut it really comes down to this interface\nand it really is Sourcefire, right?\n\n306\n00:14:51.422 --> 00:14:53.320\nAnd they just have enough money to by it.\n\n307\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.047\nI tried, but I couldn't afford it.\n\n308\n00:14:55.047 --> 00:14:57.340\nBut I had that lotto\nticket with 1.5 billion\n\n309\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.506\n>> [LAUGH] Didn't pan out?\n\n310\n00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:00.173\n>> No, no, I thought it was over.\n\n311\n00:15:00.173 --> 00:15:01.464\nI thought, yeah, I'm gonna own this thing.\n\n312\n00:15:01.464 --> 00:15:03.922\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it didn't work out.\n\n313\n00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:08.230\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's get into an ASA, guys.\n\n314\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.550\nLet's do some initial configuration.\n\n315\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.490\nIt's gonna be fun.\n\n316\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.260\nWe're gonna do some attacks and see what\nit's like, and what it blocks by default,\n\n317\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.220\nand how it looks at\ndifferent things by default.\n\n318\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.670\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's just kind of dive in.\n\n319\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.420\nI'm gonna throw a couple\nPowerPoints [LAUGH] at you again.\n\n320\n00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.990\nNot too many, just like last time.\n\n321\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.210\nBut I wanna show you some\nbasic configurations, so\n\n322\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.400\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n323\n00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.127\nSo we can see that the ASA in itself,\nyou go to global config,\n\n324\n00:15:35.127 --> 00:15:37.923\njust like you would say on a router.\n\n325\n00:15:37.923 --> 00:15:39.538\nYou still have to do the config t part,\n\n326\n00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.920\nunlike the Nexus where you\ncan just do config, right?\n\n327\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.748\nBut anyways,\n\n328\n00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:47.588\nthere's a super cool command I'm gonna\nlook at here that's in this newer coding.\n\n329\n00:15:47.588 --> 00:15:49.297\nIt's clear configure all.\n\n330\n00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:50.118\nIt's been around for awhile.\n\n331\n00:15:50.118 --> 00:15:54.067\nBut something we don't say in our iOS\nrouters and switches, where we can\n\n332\n00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:57.968\nbasically clear out the running\nconfig without rebooting the device.\n\n333\n00:15:57.968 --> 00:16:02.568\nSo, you can obviously erase your\nbackup configuration and flash.\n\n334\n00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:07.190\nAnd we don't even call in envRam or\nanything, it's just in flash on the ASA.\n\n335\n00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.910\nSo I want you to be careful because\nhere's, notice on my global config,\n\n336\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.665\nif I said clear configure all,\nhey great command you're starting over.\n\n337\n00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:17.860\nYou get something from eBay and\n\n338\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.130\njust want it back to the factory\ndefaults this is a way to do it.\n\n339\n00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.350\nObviously we want to do\na right erase reload as well.\n\n340\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.200\nBut, here's the problem\nwith this command and\n\n341\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.400\nit, basically the minute I\ntype this command in and\n\n342\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.530\nI'll show you this in a second, and\npress enter, it doesn't say are you sure?\n\n343\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.180\nDid you really mean to do that?\n\n344\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.590\nBecause if this is your\nproduction network,\n\n345\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.430\nit's gonna go down as\nsoon as you press enter.\n\n346\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.420\nSo, you press enter and\nyour network goes down by far.\n\n347\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.860\nAgain we can set the host name in our\ninterfaces, and let's run out and do this,\n\n348\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.670\ncuz I wanna talk about these names.\n\n349\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.180\nNotice they have security\nlevels in these names, and\n\n350\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.330\nthis is what's different than\nsay looking at a router.\n\n351\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.910\nNow we're definitely in what's\ncalled routed mode, all right.\n\n352\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.110\nWe could do it in a transparent but\n\n353\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.100\nthe fact is we're going\nto do it in routed mode.\n\n354\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.990\nSo we're gonna have to name and\nset a security level for interfaces.\n\n355\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.041\nThis is mandatory if you're gonna pass\ntraffic through an interface on an ASA.\n\n356\n00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:14.941\nYou have to give it a name.\n\n357\n00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:16.960\nNow the name could be just random.\n\n358\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.770\nHey, name Bob, name Sales, whatever.\n\n359\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.190\nIt really comes down\nto the security level,\n\n360\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.710\nnow, why is this name then important?\n\n361\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.970\nIt becomes important when we do\nthings like NAD or access lists and\n\n362\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.320\nso on, we use that name on the interface.\n\n363\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.330\nSo if you ever go out to your interface,\nand I had some customers that do this and\n\n364\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.200\nsay I'm gonna change the name or I'm gonna\ndelete that off of there because I want\n\n365\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.520\nto change the IP,\nI made a mistake, whatever.\n\n366\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.887\nAnd all of a sudden all their\nconfiguration for their NAD and\n\n367\n00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:44.400\ntheir ASA is gone.\n\n368\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.830\nSo you obviously, you have to\nredo it all because you can't use\n\n369\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.260\nthe save to config because\nyour name has changed.\n\n370\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.350\nSo we want to be careful with our names\nand understand that if we do change\n\n371\n00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.300\nthem it could effect our configuration so\nwe'll pay attention to that.\n\n372\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.780\n>> And there's the default names that\nare in there right which is inside for\n\n373\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.540\nthe trusted interface and outside for\nthe untrusted interface, but\n\n374\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.050\nthose are just defaults.\n\n375\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.550\nYou can change them to whatever you want.\n\n376\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.980\nSo if you're working on\nsomebody else's firewall,\n\n377\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.270\ndon't assume that there's\ngonna be inside and outside.\n\n378\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.095\nThey may not be, and\nthen if you have a third or\n\n379\n00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:14.802\nfourth interface you're gonna\nname those something different.\n\n380\n00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:18.669\nSo you might have inside outside DMZ\nyou might have sales, marketing,\n\n381\n00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:22.098\nwhatever it is that you choose and\nthose security levels also.\n\n382\n00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:23.920\n>> Yes.\n>> You've got the default of 100 for\n\n383\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.770\nthe trusted interface inside and\nzero for the untrusted.\n\n384\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.620\nThat's pretty important because\nthe default flow of traffic that's\n\n385\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.590\nallowed, right?\n\n386\n00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.410\nTraffic is allowed to go from a higher\nnumber to a lower number by default.\n\n387\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.440\nBut not the other way around.\n\n388\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.010\nA lower number can't go\nto a higher number and\n\n389\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.110\nthat's what you want\non a default firewall.\n\n390\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.410\nThe inside people should\nbe allowed to get out, but\n\n391\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.900\nthe outside people should\nnot be allowed to get in.\n\n392\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.060\nAnd we can adjust those numbers too, so\nthe defaults are important to understand,\n\n393\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.650\nbut know that people can change them.\n\n394\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.670\n>> That's right and\nwe're gonna go ahead and configure these.\n\n395\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.010\nAnd use the names I said.\n\n396\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.990\nThink of it as looking at my lab,\nI do have an inside, outside in a DMZ.\n\n397\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.220\nSo, I think he was looking ahead there,\nbut the fact is he's absolutely right.\n\n398\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.780\nWe've set it inside because we're\nsaying these guys can go out, right?\n\n399\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.940\nWe can go to www.cisco.com,\nwww.lambda.com, whatever it is, but\n\n400\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.830\nno one from the outside can get in, right?\n\n401\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.930\nBut they can respond.\n\n402\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.820\nBut, we're gonna see what happens when we\nhave specific applications that don't,\n\n403\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.640\nthat don't match.\n\n404\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.760\nIn other words,\nthe port numbers change on the way back.\n\n405\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.840\nWe'll go ahead and take a look at that,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n406\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.220\ndo something simple right now.\n\n407\n00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.380\nLet's just erase this thing and see what\nit's like to get this thing out of the box\n\n408\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.450\nand what you guys want to\ndo to get this set up.\n\n409\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.930\nI'm going to turn this off and\nI'm going to come in here.\n\n410\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.380\nSo I have an ASA here guys and\nobviously we can see that there's some,\n\n411\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.940\nthere's some data on here.\n\n412\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.640\nI was practicing some attacks before we\ncame up here, and we can see that hey,\n\n413\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.570\nmy ASA worked.\n\n414\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.990\nLook, it took this attack and denied it.\n\n415\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.270\nAnd I don't really have much of a config\non here, so the ASA, you gotta remember,\n\n416\n00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.770\nif we just configure the interfaces,\nit'll start working by default.\n\n417\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.310\nThere's a lot of default settings, and\n\n418\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.420\nwe're going to take a look\non how to see that.\n\n419\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.590\nIt's kind of fun.\n\n420\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.280\nIf you've been working on\nCisco routers and switches and\n\n421\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.350\nyou type in show run,\nyou think you see it all.\n\n422\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.730\nBut that's not true.\n\n423\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.310\nThere's another way to see more deeper\nlevel commands with a show run command.\n\n424\n00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.460\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n425\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.940\nSo the first thing I want to do though,\n\n426\n00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.410\nis understand that I can type\nanything from any prompt.\n\n427\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:16.100\nIn other words, I don't have to be\nat privileged mode or out of config,\n\n428\n00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.300\nor use the do command like on a router.\n\n429\n00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.359\nRight, so I'm just gonna do write erase,\nhow does that sound, does that look good?\n\n430\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.550\nSo notice it says, in flash memory,\n\n431\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.200\nright, we're not doing erasing the startup\nconfig, that kind of router or switch.\n\n432\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.570\nWe actually have a file and\nit's actually in flash, so\n\n433\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.830\nwe should be able to go out and see it,\nbut I'm just gonna delete that bad boy.\n\n434\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.200\nNow, once that thing is deleted and\n\n435\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.480\nyou're seeing this output here on\nthe calls cause I have logging on.\n\n436\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.890\nSo I'm gonna turn that off for right now.\n\n437\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.240\nAnd then, I'll turn it back on when we're\ngonna start sending some data through.\n\n438\n00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.760\nSo write erase, now what I gotta do, guys?\n\n439\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.800\nSo what did I do?\n\n440\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.150\nIf I did a show flash,\nwe can see that we have our ASDM file.\n\n441\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.110\nHere's our file for the ASA.\n\n442\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.360\nAnd come down here,\nhere's my boot file for\n\n443\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.510\nthe firepower module that we have in here.\n\n444\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.240\nAnd then this guy right here,\nthis firepower, is a config, so\n\n445\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.360\nI save configs in flash for\ndifferent classes that I have, right?\n\n446\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.510\nSo we can see I have the any connect here.\n\n447\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.050\nAnd then I don't have any\nbackup config anymore.\n\n448\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.140\nSo, basically,\nthe fact is is that I got rid of it and so\n\n449\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.200\nif I reload,\nwhat do you think's gonna happen here?\n\n450\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.850\nSo I'm gonna say no to this, right?\n\n451\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.010\nWe're gonna say no.\n\n452\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.570\nI think I got it.\n\n453\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.960\nDid I get that?\n\n454\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.460\nI think so.\n\n455\n00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:34.870\nMust have done something wrong.\n\n456\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.780\nNo, confirm.\n\n457\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.961\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n458\n00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:39.199\nthis takes a couple minutes to reboot.\n\n459\n00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:43.483\nThis is kinda why that other command I\nstarted to show you, the clear config all,\n\n460\n00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:47.460\nis probably better than something\nlike this because there's no waiting.\n\n461\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.594\nYou just gotta make sure that's\nreally what you wanna do and\n\n462\n00:21:49.594 --> 00:21:52.770\nas you'll see when we take a look at this,\nI'm gonna run through the set up mode.\n\n463\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.280\nSo it's gonna come up into the interactive\ndialogue just like any other router and\n\n464\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.970\nswitch and I'm sure that you've seen\nthis multiple times at the ASA.\n\n465\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.450\nThis isn't new, this has been around for\na really long time, this part.\n\n466\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.670\nSo we're gonna let this boot for\na little while.\n\n467\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.540\nAnd then we're gonna come back in and\nconfigure it through setup mode to go\n\n468\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.930\nthrough it because again, we do have some\nobjectives here we're trying to cover.\n\n469\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.700\nSo if it wasn't that and I was just\ntrying to say, hey you're in a business,\n\n470\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.670\nwe're gonna set this up,\nI'd kind of get right into it.\n\n471\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.040\nBut I do have a method to my madness\nin the sense of opening up and\n\n472\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.000\ngoing through some labs.\n\n473\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.090\nSo we'll actually do some\npractice test questions.\n\n474\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.172\nBut we can see that as we go through\nmy lab book I'm going to have some\n\n475\n00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:29.642\nquestions in there that are based on\nthe exam objectives four of them math,\n\n476\n00:22:29.642 --> 00:22:32.143\nespecially when we want to\nget the VPN section right?\n\n477\n00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:37.095\nSo we'll make the VPN section as\neasy as possible by using the ASDM.\n\n478\n00:22:37.095 --> 00:22:40.264\n>> All right, and a quick word of caution\nif this is the first time that you're\n\n479\n00:22:40.264 --> 00:22:43.886\nwiping the config on one of these devices,\nmake sure you're consoled in, because if\n\n480\n00:22:43.886 --> 00:22:47.440\nyou've SSHed in, or if you're in the web\nUI, you're going to get disconnected.\n\n481\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.650\nAnd if you had changed the IPs, the IPs\nare going to go back to default, or\n\n482\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.940\nnot be there at all, right.\n\n483\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.810\nYou could lock yourself out of the device.\n\n484\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.160\nIf it's a remote device,\nyou don't want to do it this way, right.\n\n485\n00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.030\nSo make sure you're aware of that,\nand then also be aware\n\n486\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.080\nthat when we did a write erase\nthat's wiping out the config file.\n\n487\n00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.000\nBut you may have other files sitting\nthere in flash that stay behind.\n\n488\n00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.560\nSo make sure that if you're maybe\nlike getting rid of this device,\n\n489\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.860\nselling it on eBay for example.\n\n490\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.470\nYou might want to just check Flash and\nmake sure that you haven't left any other\n\n491\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.560\nfiles laying around that\nyou don't want there.\n\n492\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.590\n>> Okay perfect.\n\n493\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.494\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at,\n\n494\n00:23:19.494 --> 00:23:21.500\nnow that the device finally booted, right?\n\n495\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.590\nWe're not in the fastest ASA,\nI'm in the least expensive ASA,\n\n496\n00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.590\nbecause that's what,\nthose were my business requirements.\n\n497\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.760\nSo, hopefully you guys can see this,\nit's the best I can do.\n\n498\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.760\nSo, this comes up since\nwe didn't have a config,\n\n499\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.530\nthis comes up into interactive prompt.\n\n500\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.400\nSo I can just do a Control+C and get out\nof this and manually configure it, and\n\n501\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.870\nthat's what we're going to do in a minute.\n\n502\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.235\nBut let's go ahead and\ntake a quick gander through here and\n\n503\n00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:44.610\ntalk about it real fast for\nthe exam objectives.\n\n504\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.110\nFirst off there's transparent mode and\nrouted mode right?\n\n505\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.500\nSo we want to do routed mode where\neach interface has its own subnet and\n\n506\n00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.492\nits own v land.\n\n507\n00:23:52.492 --> 00:23:55.448\nLike in the pre, what was it 8.3 code?\n\n508\n00:23:55.448 --> 00:23:57.655\nI think we're at 9.4 now.\n\n509\n00:23:57.655 --> 00:23:59.433\nEverything was created by VLANs.\n\n510\n00:23:59.433 --> 00:24:00.713\nThat's how we did our interfaces.\n\n511\n00:24:00.713 --> 00:24:03.033\nAnd now we don't do that,\nwe're just in subnets.\n\n512\n00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:05.193\nBut we're gonna consider them a VLAN or\nsubnet.\n\n513\n00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:09.666\nBut, if we did transparent, then\neverything is just one big [INAUDIBLE],\n\n514\n00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:10.210\nright?\n\n515\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.620\nIt's just a pass through.\n\n516\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.160\nIt's pretty rare that I would use that on\na firewall today, but it is an option.\n\n517\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.560\nI'm going to hit router because\nthat's what we do for the exam.\n\n518\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.560\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to put in a password, okay.\n\n519\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.420\nNotice it showed it, so,\n[LAUGH] that's great.\n\n520\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:31.940\nNow, this is a really good question\nhere because if you say no to this,\n\n521\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.180\nyou could have a serious issue in the\nfuture if you forget your password, right?\n\n522\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.744\nSo, if [LAUGH] you've turned this on and\nthen don't put your password down or,\n\n523\n00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:44.760\nyour note managers, and\nput their password down.\n\n524\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.510\nAnd they leave, you have no way\nto get into your box, right?\n\n525\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.010\nVery dangerous command here, so I'm\ngonna say allow password recovery, yes.\n\n526\n00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.250\nI don't care about the year.\n\n527\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.620\nIt's actually pretty close isn't it?\n\n528\n00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.710\nIs today the 24th?\n\n529\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.890\n>> Today is the 24th.\n\n530\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.790\n>> And now, here's the deal.\n\n531\n00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.850\nThis is something that I'm\nnot going to use in my pause.\n\n532\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.670\nI will go ahead and\nput something in here now like 10.1.1.1.\n\n533\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.120\nWhatever, this is the,\nthere's a port on the ASA.\n\n534\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.490\nWe have our switch ports,\non our inside, we have our,\n\n535\n00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.460\nand in one of them we can\nchoose to go to our outside.\n\n536\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.480\nThey're just basic switch ports that\nwe configure inside and outside and\n\n537\n00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.380\ntell the router what they are.\n\n538\n00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.850\nBut there's another port\ncalled the management port.\n\n539\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.040\nIt gets an IP address,\nit can be routed to it.\n\n540\n00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.770\nThey don't really recommend that you route\nto this management port, although you can.\n\n541\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.880\nIt is a routed port.\n\n542\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.938\nIt's just a little cumbersome\nto do something like that.\n\n543\n00:25:33.938 --> 00:25:38.370\nSo, we're gonna see that I don't even use\nthis management port for VASA management.\n\n544\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.640\nDo I use it for fire power management?\n\n545\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.850\nYes, you have to,\nyou don't even have a choice.\n\n546\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.335\nBut I don't have to use\nthe management port to configure it.\n\n547\n00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:47.550\nCuz I'll just come through\nthe inside interfaces, right?\n\n548\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.880\nSo not a problem.\n\n549\n00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.110\nBut I can't come through the inside\ninterfaces to manage the firepower module.\n\n550\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.660\nI have to use the management port.\n\n551\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.350\nAnd I don't need an IP address to do that.\n\n552\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.840\nI can use just layer two\ntechnologies to do that.\n\n553\n00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.670\nAnd there are some organizations\nwhere it's a requirement\n\n554\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.750\nthat they have out of band management for\nthe devices.\n\n555\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.180\nIf you have like a dedicated network\njust for infrastructure management,\n\n556\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.420\nright, that's what that management\nport's really useful for.\n\n557\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.800\nSo maybe you've got your switches,\nrouters, IPS's and\n\n558\n00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.060\nthen you've got this dedicated management\nnetwork, it's great to have that port.\n\n559\n00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.650\nBut if you don't, Iif you manage\nit just from the inside interface,\n\n560\n00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.140\nthe management interface\nis not necessarily needed.\n\n561\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.710\nI haven't looked at the newer devices.\n\n562\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.430\nIt used to be where the management\ninterface was always 100 megabit and\n\n563\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.780\nthe other interfaces\nwere higher bandwidth.\n\n564\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.590\nIs that still the same?\n\n565\n00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.790\n>> No these are all gig\nports on this X series.\n\n566\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.480\nSo I have that and\nthe PC that I'm in right now,\n\n567\n00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.390\nI'm already p'd into this PC that's\ngoing to the management port.\n\n568\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:43.390\nBut we're doing it through layer 2 and the\nIP addresses are internal through the ASA.\n\n569\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.930\nAlthough in this case here,\nwhen you're first setting up this, and\n\n570\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.880\nlet's say you wanted to use the ASD and\nyou don't like the GUI or the CLA.\n\n571\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.160\nWell, I'm a CLI guy,\nthe only reason I use the ASD now is I put\n\n572\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.850\nout a lot of ASAs and so on.\n\n573\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.280\nAnd I always just say it's more efficient,\nit's faster, you can see what you're doing\n\n574\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.620\non the it gets a little cumbersome and\nsometimes convoluted.\n\n575\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.420\nHowever, that being said I will use\nthe CLI all the way until we get\n\n576\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.565\nto the VPN's because that is such\na treat to do the VPN's like that.\n\n577\n00:27:15.565 --> 00:27:19.455\nAnd typically when I do the ASTM with\nthe VPN's, they actually just come up\n\n578\n00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:22.275\nthe first time and that's not always\nthe case when I'm doing the CLI.\n\n579\n00:27:22.275 --> 00:27:25.745\nCuz there's just a lot of obscure\ncommands that makes it pretty hard.\n\n580\n00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:28.835\nSo in this case here again,\nI wanna explain the management port.\n\n581\n00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:32.355\nI'm going to configure it now,\nbut when we erase this and\n\n582\n00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:36.780\ngo into our next episode I'm not gonna\nuse the management port for that.\n\n583\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.740\nI'm gonna use it as layer two\nto manage but the ASTM and\n\n584\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.642\nthe CLI,\nwe're gonna go through the console, right?\n\n585\n00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:46.430\nAll fright, so the mask, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and pretend now the reason\n\n586\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.760\nthat you would do this is because you\nwant to plug in a PC that has ASTM.\n\n587\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.010\nNow, how do you get ASTM\nif you don't have it?\n\n588\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.520\nWell, I don't know if you guys remembered\nwhen I did a show flash we you saw\n\n589\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.850\nthe ASTM image in there.\n\n590\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.612\nIf I https into the ASA once I get an IP\naddress it will actually prompt me to\n\n591\n00:28:01.612 --> 00:28:03.170\ndownload the ASTM, right.\n\n592\n00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.440\nThen I can just go ahead and\nconfigure it and\n\n593\n00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.940\nyou don't have to know\nanything with the CLI.\n\n594\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.450\nWell, again if you're studying for\nthis exam, it's CLI based.\n\n595\n00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.880\nAnd when we got to the EPNs I was like,\nmy god they used STM for the VPNs.\n\n596\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.750\nThis is going to take all week\nto get through this VPN section\n\n597\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.860\nbecause this is pretty intense.\n\n598\n00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.740\nThe ASTM makes it not so intense so\n\n599\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.420\nwe'll take a quick look at that\nwhen we get to our ASTM section.\n\n600\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.280\nIt'll be a lot of fun.\n\n601\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.830\nLet's go ahead and stay down here.\n\n602\n00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.160\nMy host name ASA dash one,\nI'm in pod one, right?\n\n603\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.319\nSo, domain name SFGTC.local,\n\n604\n00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:40.670\nthat's my domain server,\nmy fully qualified domain name.\n\n605\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.480\nSourcefire, globalnet training.\n\n606\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.190\nIP address, run a device manager, so\n\n607\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.290\nthis is saying who am I gonna allow\nin here to manage my network right?\n\n608\n00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.170\nSo we could type in,\nI think a network here should be\n\n609\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.910\nfine, so\nuse configuration to save the flash.\n\n610\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.030\nI'm gonna say okay, so\non your inside network here,\n\n611\n00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.970\nyou're choosing who can do it now,\non the CLI, not the setup mode.\n\n612\n00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.310\nIt's actually a little easier\nto say who can use the ASTM, but\n\n613\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.140\nin this case here maybe\nyou want to be specific.\n\n614\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.770\nI wouldn't put a particular host,\nbecause you'd have to remember that, and\n\n615\n00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.740\nif you lose it it's gonna stop working,\nright.\n\n616\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.130\nSo let's go ahead and save this to flash,\n\n617\n00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.420\nand then when we come back to our next\nepisode, we'll go ahead and delete it.\n\n618\n00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.400\nAnd we'll use that clear\nconfigure command and\n\n619\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.540\nyou'll see how easy this is\nto manually configure this.\n\n620\n00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.360\nIt's a little bit more less obscure,\nactually, than the set up mode.\n\n621\n00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.210\nThe set up mode is, honestly it's,\nto me, it's extremely annoying.\n\n622\n00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.330\n>> Yeah, Todd and I were joking about\nit before the show how the set up mode,\n\n623\n00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.700\nit's really designed to do just\nthe bare minimum of commands\n\n624\n00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.570\nto allow you to then be able to remotely\naccess the system with the ASDM, right?\n\n625\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.310\n>> Yes.\nthat's it.\n\n626\n00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.250\n>> That's the goal.\n\n627\n00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.880\nIt's not designed to be the final be all,\nend all configuration for you.\n\n628\n00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.460\nAnd you'll likely have to\ncome back to customize it.\n\n629\n00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.380\nAnd I think we both agree that normally\nwe just skip right past that and\n\n630\n00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.110\ndo the base config.\n\n631\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.690\nAnd so that's where we're gonna\npick up in the next episode.\n\n632\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.430\nWe'd do it right now, except we've\nrun out of time for this episode.\n\n633\n00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.825\nSo this is gonna have to\nbe where we'll wrap it up.\n\n634\n00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:03.580\nTodd, do you have any parting words\nbefore we wrap this episode up?\n\n635\n00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.250\n>> Now stick around, because we\nwent through the setup mode, and\n\n636\n00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.540\nwe had a little precursor of\nwhat's going on with the exam and\n\n637\n00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.605\ntalk about licensing and I think we talked\na lot about annoying stuff right now.\n\n638\n00:30:13.605 --> 00:30:18.030\n[LAUGH] So, we're gonna call that\nepisode one, annoying features.\n\n639\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.541\n>> Annoying features.\n\n640\n00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:21.084\n>> So, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna come back and\n\n641\n00:30:21.084 --> 00:30:23.810\nshow you all the phenomenal stuff and\nall the good stuff.\n\n642\n00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.960\nAnd I get real excited about this point\nbecause I don't care how many times I\n\n643\n00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.770\ndo this, watching packets go through the\nfirewall being blocked by the fire, and\n\n644\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.448\nif this isn't fun then we\nprobably want a different job.\n\n645\n00:30:34.448 --> 00:30:35.362\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n646\n00:30:35.362 --> 00:30:37.600\nAll right, well that's a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n647\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.000\nI do thank you guys all for watching.\n\n648\n00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.325\nStay tuned because we've got more\nCisco ASA Express Security coming up next.\n\n649\n00:30:46.325 --> 00:30:50.820\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.301\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.250\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.930\nback again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.480\nAnd in our last episode,\n\n7\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.250\nwe started to just dip our toes into\nthe pool of configuring an ASA.\n\n8\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.560\nAnd in this episode we're\nkicking out the stops.\n\n9\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.690\nWe're gonna jump in and get an ASA\nconfigured and up and running in an actual\n\n10\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.780\nproduction network, and kinda see\nthe different steps that we have to go\n\n11\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.330\nthrough, and the way well the way you're\ngonna experience it in the real world.\n\n12\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.290\nAnd here to help us as always is Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.380\nTodd Lammie, and Todd how are you doing\nand where we going with this today?\n\n14\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.250\n>> It's good, it's good to be back because\nnow we're gonna put that behind us.\n\n15\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.080\nWe raised the configurations,\n\n16\n00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.240\nreloaded the ASA to a couple minutes and\nstarted from scratch.\n\n17\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.680\nAnd it's fine, ended up in setup mode,\ninteractive dialog prompt, whatever.\n\n18\n00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.190\nAnd now let's go ahead and go back to\nthat and we're gonnao get rid of what I\n\n19\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.780\ncreated, cuz we did save that so we'll\njust erase that and kind of start over.\n\n20\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.430\nBut first I wanna show you the actual lab.\n\n21\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.090\nNow if you had been around and\nyou were going through the last fire power\n\n22\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.620\nsection we did last month,\nthen this is gonna be the same lab layout.\n\n23\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.450\nBut let's go ahead and\ntake a look at it, so\n\n24\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.490\nwhen I go out to the interfaces,\nthat you see what I'm doing.\n\n25\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.520\nFirst off where here in this ASA, right?\n\n26\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.170\nSo here's my ASA and I'm in this\nmanagement PC, that's what I'm RDPed into.\n\n27\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.706\nNotice this is connected in here, now this\nis M11 which is the Management Interface\n\n28\n00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:38.978\nand we'll show you in the running config.\n\n29\n00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:42.591\nNow there is an IP address here, but\ndon't get confused on not putting that IP\n\n30\n00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:46.160\naddress on the management interface,\nit's going on my fire power module.\n\n31\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.652\nSo, that's on here, so when I do my fire\npower classes students know what it is.\n\n32\n00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.840\nSo, here's my 101110 network here.\n\n33\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.860\nYou need a defense center right now,\nso we need a defense center,\n\n34\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.710\na lot of this is gonna come together\nwhere we have matching the GUI and\n\n35\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.490\neverything together with the ASA.\n\n36\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.530\nBut right now we have the ACM GUI,\nCSM for the ASA, and\n\n37\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.330\nthen Firesight Management Center.\n\n38\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.130\nAnd so,\nwe're gonna take a look at both of those.\n\n39\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.050\nSo, we need to have a defense center,\nmine's virtual, you can have an appliance,\n\n40\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.560\nbut we'll talk about why you need both\nof those when we get to that section or\n\n41\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.130\nwhy we would use one or the other.\n\n42\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.510\nSo, we're in this management PC and\n\n43\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.650\nwe're just gonna manage this guy,\nbut we're actually gonna\n\n44\n00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.940\nroute actually through the management\nport to the inside interfaces on this.\n\n45\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.250\nIt'll show you how to do that.\n\n46\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.770\nAnd so we're actually going\nto manage it from in here.\n\n47\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.540\nI have two hosts,\nI have an outside Cali Linux box,\n\n48\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.810\nvery easy to set up and do a tax,\nand really no work whatsoever,\n\n49\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020\nit's really a phenomenal box if\nyou're doing something like this.\n\n50\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.518\nAn inside host,\nthen I have a windows server and\n\n51\n00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:48.963\nthat has to do more with\nthe fire power module.\n\n52\n00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:51.075\nAll right, so we're gonna be here,\nlet's go ahead and configure this guy.\n\n53\n00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:55.765\nYou can see the different subnets,\n10 11 12, 10 11 11, 10 11 10.\n\n54\n00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.518\nLet's go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n55\n00:02:57.518 --> 00:02:59.332\nAll right so I'm gonna get back in my ASA.\n\n56\n00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.040\nAnd I'm gonna make this bigger.\n\n57\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.630\nAnd so notice I'm at the prompt ASA-1,\nand type enable, and then, password.\n\n58\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.740\nAll right, so\nthat was the password we put in for\n\n59\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.970\nthat, when we did the [COUGH] setup mode.\n\n60\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.940\nSo in the ASA here, now that I have\nit configured, I can do config,\n\n61\n00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.490\nfirst I have to be in global config okay,\n\n62\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.730\nI should have gone through this in\nthe last annoying section feature.\n\n63\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.380\nThis should have been in\nthe last annoying episode.\n\n64\n00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.200\nRight, no, I don't want to help you.\n\n65\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.910\nAll right, so anyways, where was I?\n\n66\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.979\nClear, okay, configure.\n\n67\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.310\nAnd then you can see what's kind of\nreally nice about this command is that,\n\n68\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.890\nif I do a configuration, it's kind of\nlike doing the no command in the IOS for\n\n69\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.780\nthe routers, right?\n\n70\n00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.194\nWe up arrow take, say no, and\ntake out a static route, for example.\n\n71\n00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.072\nBut in this case here, so\nI could say clear configure,\n\n72\n00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:03.290\naccess list BOB, whatever your access\nlist, cuz we name them here right?\n\n73\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.430\nThey're all kind of named\nconfig access lists, but\n\n74\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.290\nthe point is that I can just clear that\nout without having to go to each line or\n\n75\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.590\ndoing the no command,\nno access list 110, whatever.\n\n76\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.320\nIn this case here I can\nclear whatever I want, but\n\n77\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.880\nin this case I want to clear configure,\nhow about all?\n\n78\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.220\nNow remember in my slides I had that\ncareful here, cuz if you're in production\n\n79\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.110\nand you're trying to, I don't know what\nyou're trying to do, but in this case\n\n80\n00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.450\nhere you're setting it back where you're\ngetting rid of your running config.\n\n81\n00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.830\nGreat command, I love it.\n\n82\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.630\nI wish they had these on the routers\ncuz rebooting the routers,\n\n83\n00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.620\nyou erase then config and\nreloading always takes so\n\n84\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.530\nmuch time, so It would really\nbe nice to be able to have this.\n\n85\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.840\nClear configure all, boom, done.\n\n86\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.560\nNotice my prompt.\n\n87\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.830\nIt went back to the default, right?\n\n88\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.510\nSo my configuration is gone.\n\n89\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.060\nLet's take a look.\n\n90\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.290\nSo, I'm gonna do show button.\n\n91\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.320\nWhat's nice here, I don't have to\ndo a do show run, remember that?\n\n92\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.698\nSo we were so happy when the do\ncommand came out, actually, we were,\n\n93\n00:04:55.698 --> 00:04:58.486\nlike, thank you Cisco for finally doing\nsomething your competitors did for\n\n94\n00:04:58.486 --> 00:04:59.389\nten years before you did.\n\n95\n00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we thank you for\n\n96\n00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.180\nallowing us to have the do command.\n\n97\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.980\nAnd the due command is kind of annoying.\n\n98\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.679\nSo, when they came out\nwith the Naxis right, and\n\n99\n00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.260\nI don't know how much you've seen of\nNaxis, but we didn't have to do it.\n\n100\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.730\nAnd now with the latest ASA codes, or\neven way back, we can go way back, right,\n\n101\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.540\nwe go way back.\n\n102\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.330\nWe don't have to do this,\n\n103\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.280\nwe just do any command from any prompt and\nit anytime, that's a huge advantage.\n\n104\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.500\nAnd if you've been working with\nother products you're like,\n\n105\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.750\nyeah I've been able to do that for\na decade or something.\n\n106\n00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.636\n>> It saves a lot of time and,\nlet me tell you, just the mistakes.\n\n107\n00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:31.378\nBecause I'll have plenty of times where\nI'm not paying attention to what mode I'm\n\n108\n00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.836\nin, when I'm in config and\nI try to run a show command or\n\n109\n00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:37.640\nI'm in just the regular privilege prompt\nand I try to run a configuration command.\n\n110\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.090\nNow we don't have to worry about that.\n\n111\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.768\n>> Absolutely, so let's go ahead and\nlook at a basic configuration here.\n\n112\n00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:46.103\nI'm gonna use that drawing and use those\nIP addresses and we're in routed mode,\n\n113\n00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:47.790\nnot transparent mode.\n\n114\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.680\nOkay, so I'm not gonna through transparent\nmode, cuz it wasn't on the exam objective\n\n115\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.190\nand I have never use that in production,\nhave you?\n\n116\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.360\n>> Well, I have, it's really a special\ncase cuz when you're in transparent mode,\n\n117\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.870\nyour firewall becomes invisible right?\n\n118\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.140\nTraffic passes in and\nout and you can filter it.\n\n119\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.660\nYou're only on one subnet,\n\n120\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.730\nyou do have to create a kind of\na bottleneck in your network.\n\n121\n00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.860\nIt's got some advantages, but the biggest\ndisadvantage is that a lot of the advanced\n\n122\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.210\nfeatures don't work when\nyou're in transparent mode.\n\n123\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.640\nSo you lose a lot of functionality.\n\n124\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.020\nSo, it really is a special case scenario\nwhere you need to provide some kind of\n\n125\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.490\nfiltering on the network and\n\n126\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.910\nhave it invisible to the network, and it's\nnot one they could choose very frequently.\n\n127\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.995\n>> Okay, perfect, great answer.\n\n128\n00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:29.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's why he's here.\n\n129\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.685\nMy color man.\n\n130\n00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:33.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, show run.\n\n131\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.792\nSo I wanna say something\nspecial about this.\n\n132\n00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:39.980\nAll right this is, and maybe some of you\nthat are watching this have seen this,\n\n133\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.480\nplayed with the latest codes and stuff.\n\n134\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.790\nShow run.\n\n135\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.430\nBasically remember we erase.\n\n136\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.330\nI'm running 9.4, the latest,\npretty much the latest code right now.\n\n137\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.840\nThere is the enabled password still there,\nbut set our hosting back.\n\n138\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.170\nNotice my interfaces, right, so there's\nmy gig, so I can see my interfaces.\n\n139\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.300\nNow notice the, they are shut down,\nlike any router, no name yet.\n\n140\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.740\nNow, again, as I mentioned on there,\nwe have to name it, and\n\n141\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.630\nDon brought up some really\ngood points about the names.\n\n142\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.890\nYou have to name your interfaces.\n\n143\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.550\nYou can't just put an IP address on\nthere and leave it, we have to name it,\n\n144\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.990\nand we have to set a security level or\ntake the defaults that they give us.\n\n145\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.870\nEverything would be a default of zero,\nmeaning you're a low security,\n\n146\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.250\nit means you can't really go anywhere\nunless I specifically permit you.\n\n147\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.180\nSo you are automatically blocked.\n\n148\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.840\nRight, so, and\nwe're gonna talk about that more in depth.\n\n149\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.190\nSo, we look at the interface.\n\n150\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.944\nWe'll get down here and notice I have, it\nlooks like I have six interfaces, seven,\n\n151\n00:07:35.944 --> 00:07:38.520\neight, and then I have my management.\n\n152\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.900\nOkay, and so\nnow this just says management only.\n\n153\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.710\nTypically we do something like this.\n\n154\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.240\nName it management and\nmake a management port.\n\n155\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.360\nBut that's not how I run my ASAs,\nbut you can.\n\n156\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.030\nAnd so\nwe can look at some of the other stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.036\nSo let's take a look at what we're\ngoing to look at by default,\n\n158\n00:07:53.036 --> 00:07:54.920\nwhat we're going to inspect, right?\n\n159\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.219\nSo we're gonna come all the way down here.\n\n160\n00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:58.996\nAnd I could have typed this in and\nshow run Policy now,\n\n161\n00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:02.344\nright we could have just typed that in,\nso that's kind of nice.\n\n162\n00:08:02.344 --> 00:08:04.527\nSo, again let me just show run policy map,\n\n163\n00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:07.770\nnotice it's going to take me\nright down here where I am.\n\n164\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.760\nSo, you can do things like that and\nbe very specific.\n\n165\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.540\nNow, this is a really important section,\nwe'll go through this once I configure it\n\n166\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.250\nbecause this is telling\nthe ASA what to inspect.\n\n167\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.310\nSo we're always gonna inspect any TCP or\nUDP flows, but\n\n168\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.810\nthere's some applications that\nare non-standard for example.\n\n169\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.990\nDNS FTP, so as an example, and we'll\ncome back and talk about this probably,\n\n170\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.340\nis FTP as you know you're gonna go\nout with a destination port of 21.\n\n171\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.390\nAnd you know the source\nports you make up and\n\n172\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.450\nwhen the server responds,\nwhat's it come back with?\n\n173\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.500\nWell the destination is\nyour random source, but\n\n174\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.878\nwhat's your source port number?\n\n175\n00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:48.330\nIt's different than when we took off and\nso we're going to call that a non standard\n\n176\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.340\napplication and\nthen we're going to inspect that.\n\n177\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.980\nWe would never allow that\nin unless we inspect it.\n\n178\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.935\nSo, if we didn't have that in there, FTP\nwould never work by default through this\n\n179\n00:08:57.935 --> 00:09:01.950\nASA, so by inspecting that non-standard\napplication, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.950\nlet that through.\n\n181\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.160\nSo, that's just an example of\nwhat we're going to cover here.\n\n182\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.480\nBut let's do something pretty simple here.\n\n183\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.470\nLet's go into my interfaces and\nif we looked at that,\n\n184\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.449\nso, first thing we are gonna do\nis set a host name ASA-1, right?\n\n185\n00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:19.014\nAnd the enable password, you know?\n\n186\n00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.129\nOkay.\n\n187\n00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.761\nAnd that's going to be encrypted and\n\n188\n00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:27.790\nthat's really like my naval\nsecret of the routers, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.400\nSo, we don't have to go through a bunch\nof different passwords on this today.\n\n190\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.200\nAnyways, so let's go ahead and once we set\nthe password, let's go to my interfaces.\n\n191\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.330\nInterface gig 1, 1.\n\n192\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.630\nThat is my inside interface.\n\n193\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.902\nSo before we do this,\nwhat do you have to have done?\n\n194\n00:09:43.902 --> 00:09:45.350\nYou really need your\nnetwork design don't you?\n\n195\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.399\nYou have to draw it out,\nput your IPs on there, what's your inside,\n\n196\n00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:49.800\nyour outside DMZ and stuff.\n\n197\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.750\nAnd so you can't just randomly say,\nlet me make this up and then plug it in.\n\n198\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.210\nIt's going to be kind of cumbersome and\nyou could make some mistakes.\n\n199\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.910\nPlug in the cables, design your v lans.\n\n200\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.160\nInside, outside, and then come\nback here and let's configure it.\n\n201\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.750\nSo, it doesn't really take\nlong once we get going.\n\n202\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.710\nNow the first thing I'm going to do is,\nso name F, and as Don mentioned,\n\n203\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.580\nthere's a couple defaults.\n\n204\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.830\nSo inside is the only one that defaults\nto a high security level, which means\n\n205\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.910\nif you're coming from a lower security\nlevel it can't get there from here.\n\n206\n00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.870\nAll right?\nThat's the default,\n\n207\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.510\nunless they specifically allow you, right?\n\n208\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.660\nSo notice it set it to 100 by default,\nright?\n\n209\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.070\nSo let me do interface gig\none two is the other one.\n\n210\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.120\nAnd I'm going to set this on the up\narrow a couple times, see that name f.\n\n211\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.200\nChange this to outside.\n\n212\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.830\nThis is my outside interface.\n\n213\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.710\nAnd you really can get this ASA up and\nrunning just by doing this,\n\n214\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.390\ncan really get some IP addresses on here.\n\n215\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.178\nBut in the meantime, we just name them,\nand it's saying, let me do this for you.\n\n216\n00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.672\nI'm gonna inspect these different\napplications that we already saw.\n\n217\n00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:48.480\nI'm gonna inspect any\nTCP UDP flows coming through.\n\n218\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.063\nBut for example, to look in here,\ndo you see something like ICMP?\n\n219\n00:10:52.063 --> 00:10:52.840\nRight?\n>> Nope.\n\n220\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.980\n>> That's disabled by default on the ASA.\n\n221\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.200\nI would never be able to ping\nthrough an ASA by default.\n\n222\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.300\nCan you allow it?\n\n223\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.620\nSure, but\nmaybe we wanna take defaults on that.\n\n224\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.180\nNow we're not gonna take defaults,\ncuz it's fun.\n\n225\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.490\nWe're in a test environment, so\nwe definitely wanna ping and traceroute.\n\n226\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.980\nAnd traceroute is one of those other\napplications that we're gonna get into\n\n227\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.820\nthat's nonstandard.\n\n228\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.470\nIn other words, on Cisco, does anyone\nknow, you go out to with what protocol?\n\n229\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.820\nYou'd think it'd be ICMP, but it's not.\n\n230\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.350\n>> Yeah, traceroute kind of has it's\nown defined protocol, isn't it?\n\n231\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.960\n>> Well, within Cisco they do it with UDP\ngoing out and then ICMP error messages and\n\n232\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.690\ntime to let exceeded coming back.\n\n233\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.940\nThe ASA's kinda like, you went out this\nand you're coming back something else.\n\n234\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.330\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n235\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.390\nSo we'll show you how to fix that and\n\n236\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.351\nthat's just again the example\nof an application.\n\n237\n00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo you can choose your\nspecific application.\n\n238\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.972\nI'm not saying you should let ping or\ntrace route through your ASA at any given\n\n239\n00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:46.410\ntime, so we need to run diagnostics,\nbut that's turned off for a reason.\n\n240\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.260\n>> Yeah, we have to remember that Cisco,\n\n241\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.940\nthey're creating a default configuration\nthat they think is appropriate for\n\n242\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.780\nthe most amount of people that are out\nthere, the most common denominator.\n\n243\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.140\nBut in reality you have different needs\nand Cisco doesn't know your network so\n\n244\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.460\nyou may need to allow certain things.\n\n245\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.470\nYou may want to tighten this up\nfrom what their defaults are.\n\n246\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.880\nDon't just assume that the defaults\nis exactly what you need for\n\n247\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.040\nyour organization.\n\n248\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.130\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\ntheir defaults are really good.\n\n249\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.615\nSo speaking of that, I was like, hey this\nshow Ron is going to give you this and\n\n250\n00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:15.320\nlet's look at this and\nlet's see what we're inspecting.\n\n251\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.530\nBut check this out, what I've done is I've\ncreated two interfaces with some names.\n\n252\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.120\nOkay, big deal.\n\n253\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.520\nWe know we have a couple other things.\n\n254\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.530\nAnd the security levels\nwere set by default.\n\n255\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.710\nSo let's go through that and\n\n256\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.420\nthen let's do a deeper inspection of what\nthe actual default configurations are.\n\n257\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.400\nSo I'm gonna go now to another interface,\nGIG13.\n\n258\n00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.260\nThat's gonna be set to my DMZ.\n\n259\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.580\nAnd what do you think\nthe security level's going to be?\n\n260\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.982\nBy default it's going to be, what?\n\n261\n00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:47.981\nIt's gonna be zero, anything but\nthe inside is going to be zero.\n\n262\n00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:52.164\nSo, I'm going to come back here and\nset the security level to 50, and\n\n263\n00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:56.022\nthis is very common and\nthat's why I did that 100, 50, 0.\n\n264\n00:12:56.022 --> 00:12:58.092\nAbsolutely could use\nthe numbers in between,\n\n265\n00:12:58.092 --> 00:13:00.190\nbut this is very common that I see a lot.\n\n266\n00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.310\nAll right.\nSo at this point here I don't\n\n267\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.900\nhave any IPs.\n\n268\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.960\nSo we're not really doing anything.\n\n269\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.990\nBut without a name and a security level\nyou can't do anything whatsoever.\n\n270\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.260\nSo notice I did that.\n\n271\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.360\nNow on a router if you wanted to\nget your interface statistics in\n\n272\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.540\nthe configuration what do you type?\n\n273\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.060\nWhat's your,\nyou know what's your favorite command?\n\n274\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.456\n>> Once you want to configurate that.\n\n275\n00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:19.448\n>> No, you want to verify your interfaces.\n\n276\n00:13:19.448 --> 00:13:21.770\n>> Do like a show interface or\nshow IP interface.\n\n277\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.130\n>> That's the one.\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n278\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.060\nShow IP interface brief.\n\n279\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.370\nAwesome command on routers.\n\n280\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.764\nWhenever I'm teaching any MP and they're\ntroubleshooting, I'm like, well open up\n\n281\n00:13:29.764 --> 00:13:32.468\nall your screens and do a show IP\ninterface brief on all your routers.\n\n282\n00:13:32.468 --> 00:13:35.100\nSo I stand behind them and\nI'm like there's your problem.\n\n283\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.968\nYou can typically pick out more than half\nof any problem with a show IP interface\n\n284\n00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:42.200\nbrief, show IP int brief, right.\n\n285\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.790\nSo that's not going to work here.\n\n286\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.580\nSo the command that they use on here,\nit's not as good though,\n\n287\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.070\nI'm going to show you why.\n\n288\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.100\nIt's show IP.\n\n289\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.810\nAnd what this tells me is, okay,\nI don't have any IP addresses.\n\n290\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.090\nWe see that and\nwe see there's going to be a subnet mask.\n\n291\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.980\nNow that's kind of an upgrade from\nthe show IP interface brief because that's\n\n292\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.960\nwhat they're missing on there.\n\n293\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.140\nAnd they're not even showing the name,\nright?\n\n294\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.590\nSo let's go in there and\nnow this is empty.\n\n295\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.480\nSo, now I'm going to go back in here.\n\n296\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.820\nNow on.\n\n297\n00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.350\nLet's go back to interface gig one one,\nstart there.\n\n298\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:15.210\nAnd that's my insides, so that's ten,\neleven, eleven, ten, and my mask.\n\n299\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:22.620\nInterface gig one two,\nip address 10.11 I think it's 12.10.\n\n300\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.350\nAgain, I'm not randomly making these up,\nit has to do with my network design.\n\n301\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.150\nOkay, so now that we have our names and\nwe have our IP addresses and\n\n302\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.940\nwe have our security levels, now I\nshould be able to do a show IP, okay.\n\n303\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.290\nAnd notice now everything's in there,\nit's telling me my inside and outside and\n\n304\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.260\ntheir IP address,\nit is nice that it shows the mask.\n\n305\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.395\nThe one thing that always bugs me\nabout the show IP interface brief,\n\n306\n00:14:42.395 --> 00:14:44.375\nI should have put this\nin the last section.\n\n307\n00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:45.480\n[LAUGH] In the last box.\n\n308\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.090\n>> The annoying features.\n\n309\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.886\n>> The annoying features.\n\n310\n00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.420\nWhen you do Show IP Interface Brief\neverything is great.\n\n311\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.110\nYou get your IP address, you get your\nstatus, how you got it, DHCP, whatever.\n\n312\n00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.060\nAnd.\nBut the one thing they don't show you and\n\n313\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.700\nthat shows you your layer one and\nlayer two.\n\n314\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.040\nRight.\nYour up and up or up and down.\n\n315\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.760\nWhatever.\n\n316\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760\nIs it doesn't show you your mask.\n\n317\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.590\nYou have to do a show IP interface for\nthat.\n\n318\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.880\nOr something or show interface.\n\n319\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.050\nSo in this case here, we look good.\n\n320\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.550\nAre we good to go?\n\n321\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.091\nAre we done?\n\n322\n00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:08.664\n>> It's hard to tell.\n\n323\n00:15:08.664 --> 00:15:09.890\n>> Am I up and running?\n\n324\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.580\nIt is hard to tell from this,\n\n325\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.090\nbecause as a lot of you maybe saw this,\nI never enabled the interfaces.\n\n326\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.500\nBut you can't tell that from here.\n\n327\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.250\nThis is an annoying feature, right.\n\n328\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.710\nI should be able to tell if the interfaces\nare up and down or shut down, and\n\n329\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.494\nthat's what the show IP interface brief\ngives us, administratively down, right.\n\n330\n00:15:24.494 --> 00:15:26.081\nNow I'm going to come in here,\n\n331\n00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:29.880\nI'm just going to do a no shut here and\nthen go back to gig one one, no shut.\n\n332\n00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.630\nAnd I had that DMZ one but\nwe're not using that right now so\n\n333\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.300\nI'll just leave that there.\n\n334\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.180\nAgain you need to remember your names\nof your interfaces because we're\n\n335\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.070\ngonna use them inside the configuration,\nthat, your access list,\n\n336\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.650\nwhat you were going to do on IVASA,\nyou gotta have your names.\n\n337\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.402\nSo now I have the DMZ and\nI have the inside and the outside.\n\n338\n00:15:49.402 --> 00:15:51.336\nAll right so let's go ahead and do a show.\n\n339\n00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:55.609\nI'm gonna do this, show,\nrun interface, show run interface and\n\n340\n00:15:55.609 --> 00:15:58.371\nnotice it's gonna show me my interfaces.\n\n341\n00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:02.126\nHere's Gig 1/1,\nmy inside security-level 100,\n\n342\n00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:05.590\nsecurity-level 0 here,\nso this is my outside.\n\n343\n00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.770\nSo people coming from\nthe outside here cannot go out,\n\n344\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.060\nbe routed through and\ngo out Gig 1/1, not by default.\n\n345\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.174\nHowever, packets coming from Gig 1/1\ngoing to the outside, is permitted and\n\n346\n00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:18.754\na response is permitted back.\n\n347\n00:16:18.754 --> 00:16:23.324\nIt has to be part of the flow, so but\nnonetheless, we have a configuration that\n\n348\n00:16:23.324 --> 00:16:28.197\nwe can use and will it inspect and will it\nwork, sure, it's going to do some stuff.\n\n349\n00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:31.737\nNow, in this case, here we don't\nhave NAT or anything like that, but\n\n350\n00:16:31.737 --> 00:16:34.212\nwe still have a routed firewall working.\n\n351\n00:16:34.212 --> 00:16:36.480\nRight and maybe that's all you need,\n\n352\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.930\nbut we're probably go\na little bit further I think.\n\n353\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.020\nBut nonetheless, we have the IP addresses,\nwe have our name.\n\n354\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.220\nLet's look at this a bit different,\nlet me show this.\n\n355\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.930\nShow run I think it's all,\nshow run all interface.\n\n356\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.060\nMaybe I put that backwards,\nno, I didn't, okay.\n\n357\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.690\nShow run all interfacea, here.\n\n358\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.240\nSo notice he used the all command.\n\n359\n00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.450\nAnd this is what's great, because just\nwith a show run, they're, like, hey,\n\n360\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.580\ngo ahead and plug this in.\n\n361\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.330\nAnd we've got the config for\nyou in the background.\n\n362\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.400\nYou don't need to see it all,\nit's not important to you.\n\n363\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.870\nIt's running in the background,\nand it's probably true.\n\n364\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.340\nLet's take a look, so interface Gig 1/1,\nspeed and duplex is auto.\n\n365\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.480\nThat's not something that,\nwhat do you think?\n\n366\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.470\nI never do that with my switches and\nrouters and stuff, I reset everything.\n\n367\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.140\n>> Well, these days it's becoming less and\nless important because if you've got like\n\n368\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.930\na gig interface, then gig force is full\nauto duplex and will run at half duplex.\n\n369\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.740\nIt's not a big issue, but\nit used to always be an issue.\n\n370\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.240\nThat you couldn't trust your\nswitch to auto detect and\n\n371\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.440\nsee it manually set it to be sure.\n\n372\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.320\nIt is less and less common if\nyou're on a gig or higher network.\n\n373\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.407\nBut with a firewall it's very common\nthat we're plugged into broadband or\n\n374\n00:17:39.407 --> 00:17:42.739\nsomething that's not even 100 megabit,\nand so you may need to harness that.\n\n375\n00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:46.204\n>> Yeah 10/100, and I've seen this with\nmy customers and you have to look at\n\n376\n00:17:46.204 --> 00:17:49.370\nthe switch port to see that if you're\nget errors or something like that.\n\n377\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.664\nAnd if I, again I could just show int\nGig 1/1 like I would on a router and\n\n378\n00:17:52.664 --> 00:17:55.230\nit would give me the statistics and\nshow me that.\n\n379\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.810\nAnd we'll take a look\nat that in a second but\n\n380\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.320\nin this case here we have our speed and\nauto.\n\n381\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.790\nI'm not a big fan of leaving those,\n\n382\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.070\nI've seen too many problems\noccur because of that.\n\n383\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.800\nThey get out of sync or something.\n\n384\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.560\nAnyways no flow control,\nthat's fine leave that alone.\n\n385\n00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.950\nName if inside, clear to send,\nno clear to send.\n\n386\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.600\nSo does this really matter other\nthan seeing the speed and duplex.\n\n387\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.080\nIf I'd configured the speed and\nduplex manually,\n\n388\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.570\nthen they would've showed\nup in the configs anyway.\n\n389\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.750\nThe rest of these that no flow control, no\nclear to send, not really that important.\n\n390\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.980\nThe delay in here, in other words,\nis one hop, right?\n\n391\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.560\nSo we can see that,\nit's kinda cool though, right?\n\n392\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.930\nSo that's show run all, now, the other\ncommand that you want to do is show name,\n\n393\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.250\nyes how about that one, and\nwe'll see our three names.\n\n394\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.290\nSo inside, outside, DMZ, so\n\n395\n00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.530\nwe can know how we're gonna use it and\nalso shows me my security levels.\n\n396\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.830\nSo this is kind of a cool little command\nto quickly get your names that you know,\n\n397\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.660\nhey I need to go out and\ndo NAT, what did I name them?\n\n398\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.880\nWhat's the inside, what's the outside one?\n\n399\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.810\nWhat's their security level?\n\n400\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.811\n>> And that kinda goes back to something\nI mentioned in the first episode which is\n\n401\n00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.730\nthere's default values, default\nvalues of an interface called inside.\n\n402\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.956\nAn interface called outside, and\nthe default security levels of 100 and 0.\n\n403\n00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:00.720\nBut those are just defaults.\n\n404\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.380\nIf this is the first time I've logged\ninto an ASA that somebody else set up,\n\n405\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.730\nI can't trust that they set up and\nleft it at the defaults.\n\n406\n00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.480\nSo doing a quick show nameif,\nit really brings you up to speed.\n\n407\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.900\nIt's kinda like you said with the router.\n\n408\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.530\nOne of the first things you do\nwhen you log into a router,\n\n409\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.590\nshow IP interface brief.\n\n410\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.810\nGives you a great summary.\n\n411\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.792\nHere show nameif and\nthe various other commands.\n\n412\n00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:24.340\n>> Yeah, so we know that with the show IP,\nwe get some good stuff.\n\n413\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.800\nWe couldn't tell it was shut down.\n\n414\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.320\nThere was a couple other things that we\ndidn't see with that, but it's a way.\n\n415\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.770\nSo we're also going to use,\nlet's do show int Gig 1/1 for example.\n\n416\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.790\nOkay, this is a good one to get our stats.\n\n417\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.870\nThis one ends up looking\nlike any Cisco device.\n\n418\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:45.340\nNotice inside is up, line is up,\nit's auto, it's running full duplex.\n\n419\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.373\nSo we can see that and\nthe speed is 100 megs.\n\n420\n00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:50.790\nI'm a gig port but\nI'm plugged into a 100 megs switch.\n\n421\n00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.820\nSo it's because I'm not in production,\n\n422\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.540\nthat would be ridiculous to plug\ninto 100 megabit switch today.\n\n423\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.960\n>> Todd, can we test something?\n\n424\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.570\nWe're gonna go off\nthe reservation on this show.\n\n425\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.750\nWe mentioned show IP\ninterface brief on a router.\n\n426\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.500\nI know I use that command all the time,\nand\n\n427\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.050\nI haven't had a chance to test it\non the new X series of firewalls.\n\n428\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.896\nBut is the show interface IP\nbrief command still supported?\n\n429\n00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:15.335\n>> Show interface IP.\n\n430\n00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:16.659\n>> Show interface IP brief.\n\n431\n00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:19.424\n>> I don't think so.\n>> It's kind of like reversing the router\n\n432\n00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:21.020\ncommand, and there we go.\n\n433\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.870\nAll right, so\n\n434\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.710\nthis is a neat one, it's weird in\nyour mind, show IP interface brief.\n\n435\n00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.300\nIt's kind of a staple command\nthat we're used to, but\n\n436\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.540\nif you flip IP interface\naround on the firewall,\n\n437\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.820\nshow interface IP brief, it kind of\nharkens back to the old command.\n\n438\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.510\nYou get your up, up like you used to.\n\n439\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.180\nYou don't see security levels, so\n\n440\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.310\nyou don't see the names of the interfaces,\nright?\n\n441\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.774\nBut it kind of bridges that gap, so\n\n442\n00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.753\nthere's several different ways to\nget the information you want, and\n\n443\n00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:47.701\nI just hadn't had a chance to test\nthat command to see if it works yet.\n\n444\n00:20:47.701 --> 00:20:49.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, works great,\n\n445\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.206\nshow interface IP address is awesome.\n\n446\n00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:54.017\nNotice we're missing our masks.\n\n447\n00:20:54.017 --> 00:20:55.085\nI do see that we're down though.\n\n448\n00:20:55.085 --> 00:20:56.477\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n449\n00:20:56.477 --> 00:20:59.725\n>> The other thing on this command, which\nis interesting, it shows you control and\n\n450\n00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:00.266\ndata plane.\n\n451\n00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:03.192\nSo we have two basically virtual\nswitches that talk, and these are for\n\n452\n00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:06.316\nour modules, either our C accent,\nin this case our fire power module, and\n\n453\n00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:08.662\nthese are actually the data\nplane that they talk about.\n\n454\n00:21:08.662 --> 00:21:11.200\nAnd notice that they're up and up.\n\n455\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.088\nSo, basically this is the data plan that's\ncommunicating to the fire power module,\n\n456\n00:21:15.088 --> 00:21:17.850\ncuz my fire power module is up,\nif I did a show modules.\n\n457\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.310\nAnd let's go ahead and do that and\nsee what we have in here.\n\n458\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:25.153\nShow module, I think it is, it's very\nunhappy when you add that s once.\n\n459\n00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:27.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When there's no s and\n\n460\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.510\nsometimes it wants one.\n\n461\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.169\nSo, we can see that, we have the fire\npower module inside the module.\n\n462\n00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:35.334\nSo here is my module,\nI have the ASA 5506 and\n\n463\n00:21:35.334 --> 00:21:39.704\nthe sfr module is what it's called and\nthat it's up and it's up.\n\n464\n00:21:39.704 --> 00:21:42.801\n>> And tell me, when you ran clear config\nall, I know that wipes the ASA config,\n\n465\n00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.527\ndoes that wipe the fire power module also?\n\n466\n00:21:44.527 --> 00:21:48.140\n>> No, it doesn't, and you what,\nthat is a really good question.\n\n467\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.200\nI want you to bring that back when\nwe get to fire power because,\n\n468\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.550\none of the problems that I have is.\n\n469\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.961\nAnd I was working on the source fire way\nbefore where they got on the ASAs, and\n\n470\n00:21:56.961 --> 00:21:58.290\nit was the same thing.\n\n471\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.410\nThere is no set to factory default button,\nthere is no clear config or\n\n472\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.210\nwhatever it's called.\n\n473\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.590\nIt's just, you've configured it,\nso if you're going to do it.\n\n474\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.955\nBut, if you're using a virtual machine,\nobviously you can revert to snapshot,\n\n475\n00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:11.070\nwhich I do for my classes.\n\n476\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.940\nBut, in the sense of\nan appliance it is what it is.\n\n477\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.860\n>> Yeah, just something to keep in mind.\n\n478\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.990\n>> It would be nice, so\n\n479\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.187\nthe way that I actually do it\nis you reinstall the module.\n\n480\n00:22:21.187 --> 00:22:23.344\nThat's pretty annoying, cuz on the 5506,\n\n481\n00:22:23.344 --> 00:22:26.296\n[LAUGH] something to add to our\nannoying module we need to go back to.\n\n482\n00:22:26.296 --> 00:22:29.271\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] To set the firepower module on\n\n483\n00:22:29.271 --> 00:22:32.557\nthe ASA back, you actually have\nto reinstall the boot image and\n\n484\n00:22:32.557 --> 00:22:33.490\nthe system file.\n\n485\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.928\nAnd on the ASA 5506 it\ntakes a couple hours.\n\n486\n00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:38.916\nOn the higher end models it doesn't\ntake that long, 10, 15 minutes.\n\n487\n00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:41.137\n>> Unfortunately,\nit's not something we do all the time,\n\n488\n00:22:41.137 --> 00:22:42.627\nyou acquire a new device or whatever.\n\n489\n00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.089\n>> Yeah, exactly, okay, so where were we.\n\n490\n00:22:45.089 --> 00:22:49.266\nNow, so we're looking at this, and\nlet's go back to my drawing, if I can.\n\n491\n00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:51.147\nLet me find it here.\n\n492\n00:22:51.147 --> 00:22:55.629\nSo basically guys where we were,\nwe already pinged in here.\n\n493\n00:22:55.629 --> 00:22:59.530\nI have my inside host configured here,\nit's 10.11.11.\n\n494\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.056\n>> 10.11.12.250 is my attack host,\nso we should see if we can through.\n\n495\n00:23:04.056 --> 00:23:07.729\nI've got IP addresses, I don't have any\nrouting or anything, but they're two\n\n496\n00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:11.500\ndirectly connected hosts and really don't\nneed routing for this network, do I?\n\n497\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.020\nBecause they're both directly connected,\nright?\n\n498\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.450\nI do need it for my management,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n499\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.930\ntake a look here for a second.\n\n500\n00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:22.130\nSo I'm gonna come back here and one of\nthe things that I wanted to do was, so\n\n501\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.050\nbe careful here.\n\n502\n00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.090\nlogging con7, so what does this say?\n\n503\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.990\nWell this is my sys log level and so\nit's all the way up to debugging.\n\n504\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.220\nSo there's eight levels in sys log and\nyou can come to my CCNA class and\n\n505\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.729\nthey really get in depth in that on\nthe ICN2 side on the different levels and\n\n506\n00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:38.685\nyou have to memorize that today.\n\n507\n00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:42.555\nBut anyways, so\nwe're gonna do logging 7 here.\n\n508\n00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:43.993\nIf you do this in production,\n\n509\n00:23:43.993 --> 00:23:47.563\nyou'll probably be hurting because\nit's gonna take everything that's\n\n510\n00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:51.259\nhappening basically across the CPU and\nsending it to your console, right?\n\n511\n00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:54.690\nSo then, logging on and\nnow that sees I'm logging, and\n\n512\n00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.744\neven enabled that I was logging.\n\n513\n00:23:56.744 --> 00:23:58.160\nSo let me go over here and log in here.\n\n514\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.623\nLet's see if I can see anything.\n\n515\n00:23:59.623 --> 00:24:01.143\nThis is my Kali Linux.\n\n516\n00:24:01.143 --> 00:24:04.198\nAnd so now I'm gonna attack that\ninside host through the ASA,\n\n517\n00:24:04.198 --> 00:24:07.194\nthe default gateway is already\nconfigured to go to my ASA, so\n\n518\n00:24:07.194 --> 00:24:09.510\nwhen it sends the attack\nit's gonna go there.\n\n519\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.780\nLet's see what the ASA does.\n\n520\n00:24:13.363 --> 00:24:15.557\nYeah, we really haven't\nconfigured much but\n\n521\n00:24:15.557 --> 00:24:19.110\nwe don't really need much to\nreally get an ASA off the ground.\n\n522\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.110\nSo let's see if it did anything.\n\n523\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.280\nNot yet.\nDid I get it.\n\n524\n00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.240\n>> Yeah, at this point we haven't\nconfigured any firewall rules, so\n\n525\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.230\nwe're strictly relying upon\nthose security levels.\n\n526\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.070\nRight?\nThe fact that your external host,\n\n527\n00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.230\nyour Kali Linux host is out there\nin security level zero, and\n\n528\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.980\nthen our internal host is inside on\nsecurity level 100, so you got somebody\n\n529\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.290\ncoming from a lower number to a higher\nnumber, it should be blocked by default,\n\n530\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.990\neven if you haven't configured\na single firewall rule.\n\n531\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.890\nBut then that inside host is on a 100,\nthey should be able to get\n\n532\n00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.910\nout to the Internet,\nwhich is a zero, and browse out and\n\n533\n00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.240\naccess whatever it is they want to\naccess because it's a higher number.\n\n534\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.670\nAnd that is all without\nconfiguring firewall rules.\n\n535\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.020\n>> Absolutely, so\nI was able to go out to the Kali Linux and\n\n536\n00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.660\nwe're gonna do some attacks from it.\n\n537\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.600\nBut the one thing that you can do by\ndefault, this is really interesting and\n\n538\n00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.620\nprobably something that I typically go on\nthe disable list, I can't ping my ASA.\n\n539\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.770\nI can't ping through it and\nwe're gonna fix that for fun.\n\n540\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:18.540\nBut by default, I can't ping through it,\nbut I can ping the interfaces.\n\n541\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.930\nSo let's talk about that for one second.\n\n542\n00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.530\nSo, I basically there's outside\nof my Kali Linux and like okay,\n\n543\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.340\nI'm sending this attack,\nnothing's happening.\n\n544\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.870\nLet me ping it, make sure I'm alive.\n\n545\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.720\nAnd we can see,\nthis is my connection table, right.\n\n546\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.280\nSo this is actually what's happening.\n\n547\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.582\nSo, an objective for your exam here is\nwhen a packet comes in, that packet is\n\n548\n00:25:35.582 --> 00:25:39.751\ncompared to the connection table first\nto see if there was a connection for\n\n549\n00:25:39.751 --> 00:25:42.530\nthat already before it\nhits your routing table.\n\n550\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.691\nAll right so that's an exam objective.\n\n551\n00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:46.810\nConnection table is checked first.\n\n552\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.269\nAnd we can see this with the show\nI think it was local host right?\n\n553\n00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.420\nShow all local hosts,\nyeah that's my connection table.\n\n554\n00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.430\nThere's really no connection because\nhere's what happens as soon as\n\n555\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.670\nI was to ping through and\n\n556\n00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.900\nthis is actually just logging, telling\nme what was happening on that interface.\n\n557\n00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.200\nBut if I was to ping through it,\nit actually make a connection.\n\n558\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.509\nTo really see this we're going to\nhave to do something like telnet or\n\n559\n00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:08.245\nsomething with TCP.\n\n560\n00:26:08.245 --> 00:26:09.031\n>> Something with TCP.\n\n561\n00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:12.323\nYeah, you get a hand shake, you build\nthat connection, and you hold it open for\n\n562\n00:26:12.323 --> 00:26:13.070\na period of time.\n\n563\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.270\ni see MP every packet is its\nown independent communication.\n\n564\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.350\nSo you don't see much.\n\n565\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.140\n>> Absolutely.\n\n566\n00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.430\nNow, so\nI want to be able to ping from my insides,\n\n567\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.970\nso if I'm on my inside host here,\nlet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n568\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.140\nSo here, I'm at the ASA.\n\n569\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.580\nI ping the interface\nfrom the outside host.\n\n570\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.780\nLet's go ahead and\nping the interface to the inside.\n\n571\n00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.170\nThis is my ASA inside interface here.\n\n572\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:39.836\nNow, remember we said inside and outside,\nso I should be able to ping 10, 11,\n\n573\n00:26:39.836 --> 00:26:40.783\n12, 250.\n\n574\n00:26:40.783 --> 00:26:41.572\nThat's the outside host.\n\n575\n00:26:41.572 --> 00:26:44.789\nIn other words, ping through and always\nwould allow a response back if I'm going\n\n576\n00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:46.930\nfrom a high interface to\na low interface MAC, right?\n\n577\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.420\nBut we're gonna see that's not allowed.\n\n578\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.810\nAnd let's go ahead and take a look why.\n\n579\n00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.500\nAll right, so here I am here.\n\n580\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.030\nLet's tear down, so\nlet's take this apart, right?\n\n581\n00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:59.520\nSo notice I'm creating the connection and\nnow for every packet, ICMP ping packet\n\n582\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.150\nthat goes out there, it's going to create\na connection in the connection table.\n\n583\n00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.200\nWhen that comes back it is gonna\ntear it down for each and every one.\n\n584\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.950\nIt never keeps it.\n\n585\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.580\nIt doesn't allow to keep\nthat session open so\n\n586\n00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.595\nsomeone can see, I don't know do a smurf\nattack or ping or something like that.\n\n587\n00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:14.160\nThat's what the reality is.\n\n588\n00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.790\nSo we can see here that, okay,\nso tear down ICMP connection, so\n\n589\n00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.180\nI've sent it out there,\nping 10 11 11 here.\n\n590\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.860\nOkay, so it says the local\nhost was then been torn down.\n\n591\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.720\nThis was me pinging the inside host.\n\n592\n00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.700\nNow, I'm building one that says,\nhey, I want to go to 10.11.12.250.\n\n593\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.193\nIt says, outbound ICMP connection for\nfast using the address,\n\n594\n00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:37.810\n10.11.12.250 going to 10.11.11.11.\n\n595\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:44.204\nWe're gonna deny the source going\nto the outside to 10.11.12.250.\n\n596\n00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:48.600\nComing from 10.11.11.11,\nnow this is type zero code zero,\n\n597\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.460\nthose are ICMP codes, let's go ahead and\nwe just have a few more, we have enough\n\n598\n00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.110\ntime left on this episode, let's go and\nlook at ICMP codes for a second.\n\n599\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.660\nSo ICMP error codes, how does that sound?\n\n600\n00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.560\nError codes.\n\n601\n00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.532\nShould come up with something here, and\nyou can see, I've been there before.\n\n602\n00:28:06.532 --> 00:28:08.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And we got zero.\n\n603\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.250\nIt's an echo reply.\n\n604\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.446\nSo basically in here, it's an echo reply.\n\n605\n00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:13.864\nWe're denying it.\n\n606\n00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:17.328\nSo, when I allow,\nwhen we come back in the next episode,\n\n607\n00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:21.890\nwe're gonna go ahead and fix this,\nbecause why am I not being able to ping?\n\n608\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.450\nWe did say that the higher Level of\nsecurity and go to the lower and back.\n\n609\n00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.010\nBut I'm not able to ping right now, and\n\n610\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.580\nthe fact is that if I did something\nelse like telnet, it would work.\n\n611\n00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.460\nSo why is it that ping's not working?\n\n612\n00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.500\n>> And it goes back to what I mentioned\nearlier about how with ping, every single\n\n613\n00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:43.690\npacket's its own session and Cisco handles\nit differently and unless we're inspecting\n\n614\n00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.240\nthat, unless the firewall's aware of\nwhat that is, it's not going to work.\n\n615\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.860\n>> And really we need to inspect it\nbecause it's going out one protocol,\n\n616\n00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.030\ncoming back another.\n\n617\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.656\nThat really freak us out the ASA\nis never going to let something,\n\n618\n00:28:54.656 --> 00:28:56.613\nI don't know if it freaks out,\nbut I freak out.\n\n619\n00:28:56.613 --> 00:28:59.633\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know about ASA but\n\n620\n00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:02.470\nthat's my norm So anyways,\nkeep an eye on this.\n\n621\n00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.990\nWe're coming back to these error codes\nbecause when I let there through we'll see\n\n622\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.790\nwhat it is.\n\n623\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:12.100\nBut in this case here we're not allowing\nthis because we're not inspecting it.\n\n624\n00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.980\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and stop this episode,\n\n625\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.500\nwe've been long enough, and\nwe've got our interfaces configured.\n\n626\n00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.080\nAnd because we're in such a small network\nI'm not worried about a lot of things like\n\n627\n00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.650\nrouting, and when we get to the internet\nhere in a minute I'm gonna have to\n\n628\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.860\nconfigure NAD and\nwe'll talk about object with NAD and\n\n629\n00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.870\nhow different they than the ASAs and\nwe'll talk about the access list.\n\n630\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.010\nThose are in upcoming episodes,\nso stick around.\n\n631\n00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.720\nBut in the next one here what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna fix this,\n\n632\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.570\nwe're going to inspect ICMP and then we're\ngonna poke a hole in the firewall so\n\n633\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.380\nwe can actually get from the outside in.\n\n634\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.340\nRight, and what we're going to learn from\nthat for the exam objectives is setting up\n\n635\n00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.610\nspecific applications for businesses as\nthat have customized applications and\n\n636\n00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.020\nthat's real big on this on this objective.\n\n637\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.930\n>> Yeah, and that's gonna be a key piece\nof deploying an ASA in new environment\n\n638\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.520\nbecause only you know what needs to\nbe allowed through your firewall.\n\n639\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.270\nThe default is inside host allowed,\noutside host allowed, or not allowed in.\n\n640\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.750\n>> Yeah, yeah yeah.\n>> Almost screwed that up.\n\n641\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.390\nBut then, you'll have to poke holes for\n\n642\n00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.900\neach of the various protocols and\nICMP may or may not be one of them.\n\n643\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.430\nAlight well Tom, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap this one up.\n\n644\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.190\nLike you mentioned, we definitely\nhave more coming up because we\n\n645\n00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.555\nhaven't poked any holes\nin the firewall yet.\n\n646\n00:30:15.555 --> 00:30:16.620\n>> [LAUGHING]\n>> So we are going to do that next.\n\n647\n00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.460\nSo stay tuned for our next episode but\nuntil then thank you guys for watching.\n\n648\n00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.020\nSigning off for ITPro.tv, I'm Don Pisette.\n\n649\n00:30:23.020

00:00:16.941\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:18.770\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.570\nBack again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.100\nAnd in this episode we're gonna continue\non with our initial device configuration.\n\n7\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.820\nIn our last episode we left you with\nthat cliff hanger that we had a firewall\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.790\nconfigured, but we weren't able to ping\nfrom the inside out because we were\n\n9\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.090\ngetting blocked by the firewall.\n\n10\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.940\nSo we're going to pick right back up\nwhere we left off in Part One and\n\n11\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.160\nget that fixed and\nallow that traffic to pass through.\n\n12\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.490\nAnd here to help, as always, we've got Mr.\nTodd Lammle here in the studio with us.\n\n13\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.940\nAnd Todd, where are we going from here?\n\n14\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.643\n>> Well, that's a good question,\nbecause we're going to go ahead and\n\n15\n00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:51.533\ntake look at the routing table and\nsee what we're directly connected to,\n\n16\n00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.116\nmake sure we can ping both our hosts, and\n\n17\n00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:55.802\nthe hosts can both ping our\ninterfaces by default that's enabled.\n\n18\n00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:59.979\nI'm going to show you how to disable that\nbecause when we put your ASA in you want\n\n19\n00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:00.940\nto ping it right?\n\n20\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.330\nTest connectivity make sure\neverything is going fine.\n\n21\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.570\nAnd then you can go ahead and turn that\noff, maybe leave the inside one on.\n\n22\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.850\nBut certainly turn off the outside one.\n\n23\n00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.810\nSo then the other thing we were doing is,\nI was trying to just ping through using\n\n24\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.900\nit as an application right and\nit was a really great example.\n\n25\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.320\nCuz we discussed, it goes out UDP and\ncomes back ICP error messages.\n\n26\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.050\nSo the fact is, because it does that,\n\n27\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.320\nit doesn't work by default\nunless we inspect it.\n\n28\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.580\nSo that's why, if we take a look at what\nwe're gonna inspect, and we will get into\n\n29\n00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.140\nthe inspection engine in a little\nbit more detail in another episode.\n\n30\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.810\nBut let's just go ahead and fix the issue\nthat we have and make it work, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.842\nAnd then take a look at\nthe connection table.\n\n32\n00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.870\nAll right so let's come down here and\n\n33\n00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.850\nunderstand that if we do\na show run policy map.\n\n34\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.720\nI want to show you this though.\n\n35\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.680\nAnd we take a look at this and\nif we did a run all,\n\n36\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480\nlike a show run all policy map,\nwe'd see an enormous amount.\n\n37\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.250\nAnd we're going to take a look at\nwhat the really inspection is and\n\n38\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.890\nwhat's going on in those\ninspection engines, so we can see.\n\n39\n00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.530\nYou know first off there is three things\nwe need to pay attention to here,\n\n40\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.190\nwhen we are inspecting traffic.\n\n41\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.519\nThe first thing is you create a class,\nright.\n\n42\n00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:13.090\nYou created this class map so basically\nthis default, I usually use a default but\n\n43\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.690\nyou're going to see when we get to the\nsource fire that I created another class.\n\n44\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.770\nNow class tells us what to inspect.\n\n45\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.200\nThen we put that into\na container called a policy map.\n\n46\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.390\nSo this policy map holds classes and\nthese classes tell us what to inspect,\n\n47\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.870\nand I can have multiple\ndifferent classes under there.\n\n48\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.210\nThen the policy, the reason we put it all\nin a policy map, cause then we can take\n\n49\n00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.770\nall these different parameters and\nput them on an interface and\n\n50\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.260\nI can't see it with this command,\nbut if I did a show run.\n\n51\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.810\nAnd came down to the bottom.\n\n52\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.020\nI'll just go all the way down.\n\n53\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.330\nIt's almost the last thing,\nalways, in your config.\n\n54\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.700\nAnd we're gonna see the service policy.\n\n55\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.560\nThis is really part three\nof the inspection engine.\n\n56\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280\nSo we have our policy map, and\nin there we have our classes,\n\n57\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.290\nwhich tell us what to inspect.\n\n58\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.850\nAnd then we're gonna take all that,\n\n59\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.210\nand put this on the interfaces\nwith the service policy.\n\n60\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.560\nIn this case here,\nwe're saying use the global policy.\n\n61\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.510\nAnd globally put that on all interfaces.\n\n62\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.110\nAnd I like to use the global policy a lot.\n\n63\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.360\nIt makes it simple, it's easy to see, but\n\n64\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.030\nthere's a lot of reasons why we\nwould create a different one.\n\n65\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.290\nSecondly, I can have many different\npolicies on the same interfaces, and\n\n66\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.850\nthis becomes important when we have a lot\nof applications that we want to inspect.\n\n67\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.560\nBut in this case here, so I'm in\nthe ASA and I'm gonna ping 10 11 11 11,\n\n68\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.760\nthat's my inside host.\n\n69\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.810\nAnd then you can see\nthe connection table and\n\n70\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.420\nbasically because I have that login I'm\ngonna keep that on for a little bit.\n\n71\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470\nBut you can see that this actually worked,\nbuilt outbound ICMP connection.\n\n72\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.090\nRemember, this is a directly\nconnected host, it's gonna work.\n\n73\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.310\nBut, notice then it tears\nit down right away.\n\n74\n00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.240\nThe other thing I want to ping 10\n11 12 250 that's my outside host.\n\n75\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.760\nCan I get to that?\n\n76\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.130\nSo from my ASA, and again I could do show\nroute, it's not show IP route on this like\n\n77\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.770\non the router, it's show route, and\nI can see my directly connected networks.\n\n78\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.860\nThe L's are my length, the IP addresses\nare my actual interfaces right,\n\n79\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.710\nthat's kind of newish I suppose,\nlike less than five years old.\n\n80\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.510\nAnyways, we have our\ndirectly connected inside.\n\n81\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.080\nWe can see that.\n\n82\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.630\nDirectly connected outside.\n\n83\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.990\nSo not a lot going on in here,\nbut we'll fix that in a minute.\n\n84\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.940\nThe key is,\nremember we're here at my inside host, and\n\n85\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.520\nI can be 10, 11, 11,\n10 which is my ASA inside interface, and\n\n86\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.770\nnotice I can see it and my connection\ntable's gonna show that as well.\n\n87\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.733\nThat being said, I can ping 10.11.12.250,\nthat's my outside host.\n\n88\n00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:31.000\nAnd we're gonna see that\nthat's gonna be blocked.\n\n89\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.620\nThat's denied, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.080\nSo even from my inside host I can't\nget out because we didn't inspect it.\n\n91\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.500\nSo by looking at that service policy\nyou can see what we're inspecting, and\n\n92\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.890\nICMP's not there.\n\n93\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.260\nWell, so we can go in here, and\n\n94\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.500\nwe can say service [INAUDIBLE]\nI should turn off logging here.\n\n95\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.690\nWait a minute, did I stop this?\n\n96\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.190\nAll right.\n\n97\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.970\nOkay, so do show run service,\nI spelled it wrong.\n\n98\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.550\nDon over here likes to read\nthings backwards and forwards.\n\n99\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.250\nI did a do.\n\n100\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.940\nI did a do.\n\n101\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.057\n>> You know,\nit's hard to get out of the REBel habits.\n\n102\n00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:10.000\n>> You can tell I was just working on\nmy IOS routers, so, show, run, service.\n\n103\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.260\nPlus you know they starve you here at\nITP TV Pros, and haven't eaten all day.\n\n104\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.870\nSo, they're like more episodes,\nback to work.\n\n105\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.823\n>> No food until the series is done,\nthat's the rule around here.\n\n106\n00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:22.830\n>> So you can see my.\n\n107\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.900\nThis is my service policy, so\nI didn't have to do a show, Ron.\n\n108\n00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo, service.\n\n109\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.840\nThat's fine.\nAnd it's telling me.\n\n110\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.930\nI'm looking at that, but\nit's not really what I want, right?\n\n111\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.600\nI want my policy map,\nis what I want it to do.\n\n112\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.930\nAnd I can do a show run all.\n\n113\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.420\nAnd we'll kind of come back\nwhen we do our next episode and\n\n114\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.010\ndo a show run all policy map and\nshow what we're actually inspecting.\n\n115\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.860\nBecause we could look deeper\ninto the inspections and show.\n\n116\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.640\nWe can see right here.\n\n117\n00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.190\nWe want to be into our class\ninspection default, so\n\n118\n00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.520\nit's kinda two steps to get in.\n\n119\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.460\nAnd then we'll just leave a service\npolicy on all the interfaces and\n\n120\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.550\nnot bother with it.\n\n121\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.140\nAgain, even when I do my source farm,\nI'm gonna create a new class, but\n\n122\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.980\nI'm gonna put the class inside this\ncontainer, inside this policy map.\n\n123\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.530\nAnd then I don't have to worry about it.\n\n124\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.090\nAll right, so anyways, so I'm gonna come\nin here and I'm gonna say policy map.\n\n125\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.580\nNow, remember you can't really use the\nthe tab key on here, because you'd think\n\n126\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.890\nglobal and tab key, that's not gonna work\nbecause this is actually a name and I can\n\n127\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.260\ncreate many of them, so you might end up\nchanging names, so this isn't a default.\n\n128\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.120\nI mean it is default but\nI can't use my tab on there.\n\n129\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.740\nSo, I'm getting into this global policy\nand then if I was to name it, so\n\n130\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.250\nbe careful when you type this in\nbecause if you type it in wrong,\n\n131\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.590\nit's just going to create another policy,\nright.\n\n132\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.300\nThinking that's the new name for it.\n\n133\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.390\nSo be aware.\n\n134\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.320\nA lot of times, I'll just copy and paste\nthese in so I don't make any mistakes.\n\n135\n00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.060\nBut for me, now I'm in the service policy.\n\n136\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.691\nI'm in the policy app,\nnow I want to get into the class.\n\n137\n00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.478\nSo I'm going to say class inspection,\n\n138\n00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:51.540\nagain I can't use my tab on this and\nnow, I'm in with my.\n\n139\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.270\nI know that's annoying with the logging,\nbut\n\n140\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.820\nI'll leave that on for one more second.\n\n141\n00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.740\nBut anyways, now I'm into a place where\nwe can tell it to inspect, right?\n\n142\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.860\nBefore, we're just in\nthe container with the classes.\n\n143\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.280\nThe classes are what's important to us.\n\n144\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.290\nSo, I'm going to say\ninspect question mark and\n\n145\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.040\nit's going to tell us\neverything that we can do here.\n\n146\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.770\nNotice here, I can do some specific stuff\nwith http, and that bios, and so on.\n\n147\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.960\nBut one of the things right here,\nwe've got IC and P right.\n\n148\n00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.090\nSo now I'm going to say,\nwell go ahead and inspect IC and P.\n\n149\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.820\nIt's going to say,\nwell that's kind of outside the norm,\n\n150\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.330\nwhere it goes out one portal and\ncomes back another.\n\n151\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.800\nAs we've discussed many times.\n\n152\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.960\nAnd the fact is,\nit's going to say okay I understand that,\n\n153\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.380\nwe're going to allow that.\n\n154\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.201\nSo it's pretty simple.\n\n155\n00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.870\nI have CMP done.\n\n156\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.700\n>> And some of those inspections\nare really simple like this one.\n\n157\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.650\nWhere it just says hey, we're gonna go out\nas one protocol and come back as another.\n\n158\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.410\nSome are fare more advanced, like the FTP\none, where it actually monitors for\n\n159\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.940\nthe passive command.\n\n160\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.719\nJust see what port number\nyou're about to jump to.\n\n161\n00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:49.567\nIt does some really intelligent things,\nand\n\n162\n00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:51.911\nCisco has custom made each\nof those inspection engines.\n\n163\n00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:54.557\nThey're not just copies of the same\nthing with different port numbers.\n\n164\n00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.297\n>> That's right and he brings up\na good point because that's a default.\n\n165\n00:07:57.297 --> 00:08:00.549\nUnder the global policy of the policy map,\nright, the atropy?\n\n166\n00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:04.662\nSo we're able to do atropy through this\nbecause they assume that you want to.\n\n167\n00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:08.190\nAll right, so let's go ahead now,\nI should be able to ping the remote host.\n\n168\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.680\nBecause I'm on my inside host,\nwe're inspecting ICMP, and\n\n169\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.920\nnow I'm pinging the outside host.\n\n170\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.240\nSo I'm going from the inside out, right?\n\n171\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.857\nSo in here, we can see this.\n\n172\n00:08:17.857 --> 00:08:22.640\nSo build outbound ICP connection, right,\ntelling me where it's going down and\n\n173\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.100\nas soon as I get that one ping, and it's\ngonna tear it down and build it back up.\n\n174\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.770\nSo I can see that and\ngo from the inside out.\n\n175\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.080\nBuild the local host, and we can see the\ndifferent addresses where we're going and\n\n176\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.240\nkeep a track on this.\n\n177\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.890\nNow, remember this show local\nhost is my connection table.\n\n178\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.260\nIf I'm doing something like ping where\nit sends a packet and tears it down,\n\n179\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.810\nas soon as it gets a response,\nagain, why does it do that?\n\n180\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.900\nBecause if we leave that open,\nthen you're vulnerable for attack, so\n\n181\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.348\nit's gonna tear down everything.\n\n182\n00:08:49.348 --> 00:08:53.666\nSo we would have to create something\nthat runs, like you said a TCP.\n\n183\n00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:57.649\nSo now that I'm pinging from the inside\nout, and I can ping that remote host, and\n\n184\n00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:00.695\nif again, if I was browsing something,\nthat would work too,\n\n185\n00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.110\nright, if I had a web browser on\nthat server, so now that would work.\n\n186\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.690\nSo again, we really didn't\nneed to do this permit ICMP.\n\n187\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.390\nI wouldn't do that\nnecessarily in production.\n\n188\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.590\nWe could just all of a sudden, but\nkind of, we'd put, what would we do?\n\n189\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.110\nWe'd put our IP addresses, our names,\n\n190\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.280\nour security levels, we would have to do\nsome sort of routing, default routing,\n\n191\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.350\nall that, to be able to start\nworking on the Internet.\n\n192\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.950\nBut this is a firewall.\n\n193\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.070\nIt's kind of up and running.\n\n194\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.680\nNow we're inspecting ICMP, pretending\nthat it's some special application.\n\n195\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.987\nRight, but now,\nlet's go out to the outside host.\n\n196\n00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:32.668\nAnd so\nlet me find my cali linux over here.\n\n197\n00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:36.720\nOkay, see if this comes back for me.\n\n198\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.050\nThere we go.\nHey, this one came right back.\n\n199\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.770\nOkay.\n\n200\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.630\nAnd now, I wanna ping my inside host.\n\n201\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.637\nping 10.11.12.10, that's the firewall,\nthe 10.11.12.10, okay.\n\n202\n00:09:47.637 --> 00:09:54.871\nAnd you have to stop this, so the inside\nhost is 10.11.11.11, and I can't do it.\n\n203\n00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:58.295\nEven though I'm inspecting ICMP,\nlet's leave that running, and\n\n204\n00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.106\nwe're gonna see deny and dot ICMP.\n\n205\n00:10:00.106 --> 00:10:05.335\nThe source is outside going to the inside,\nand that's denied by default, right?\n\n206\n00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:07.470\n>> Yep, and that's building right\noff of those security levels.\n\n207\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.950\nThe outside host has a security level\nof 0, and the inside host is 100.\n\n208\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.580\nA low number can't go to a high number\n\n209\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.926\nunless you put some firewall rules\nin there, and we certainly could.\n\n210\n00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:20.548\nWe really wouldn't wanna do that but\nwe could put firewall rules in that said\n\n211\n00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:22.220\nthe outside which is allowed\nto ping inside our network,\n\n212\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.380\nand then it would start working,\nbut until we do that, it's out.\n\n213\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.787\n>> Yeah, and in the next episode,\nwe're gonna do that because it's fun.\n\n214\n00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:31.548\n[LAUGH] So, we get to do that, and\nagain, what I want you guys to focus on,\n\n215\n00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:35.140\nwhat I'm doing here, and\nI'm using a very simple protocol.\n\n216\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.540\nIs that the idea is, no,\nwe're not letting ping or ICMP, but\n\n217\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.230\nI'm using it as an example to\nsay we can open up holes, and\n\n218\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.600\nwe're gonna show you how to do that for\nspecific applications.\n\n219\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.810\nThe first thing is, a lot of times,\nif you're on the inside and\n\n220\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.820\nyou set up your ASA,\npeople are like hey, I can't get here,\n\n221\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.070\nI can't get there, it's cuz you're not\ninspecting the application, right?\n\n222\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.410\nSo we need to understand the protocol,\nhow to inspect it, and, for\n\n223\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.919\nexample, this was ICMP.\n\n224\n00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:02.640\nSo remember, we wanna look at our\nconnection table, we wanna understand on\n\n225\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.759\nhow to get this working, but let's see\nwhat happens now when I have the firewall.\n\n226\n00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:10.425\nIt's up and working before,\nI just had a router, so\n\n227\n00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.650\nwe were very vulnerable to attacks,\nit was just an IP address.\n\n228\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.170\nNow that we have this firewall in,\nwe really haven't done that much,\n\n229\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.450\nbut again, the idea of the ASA is hey,\n\n230\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.980\nput a couple IP addresses on there, name\nyour interface, set your security levels.\n\n231\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.180\nWe'll inspect the traffic for you, and\nwe're gonna stop attacks immediately.\n\n232\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.210\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n233\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.900\nSo I'm gonna go back to my cali here,\nclose this, and\n\n234\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.510\nI'm gonna attack the inside host.\n\n235\n00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.020\nI'm gonna try to.\n\n236\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.880\nActually I don't think\nit's going to do it.\n\n237\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.270\nI have to set up some other connections in\nthe next episode before we can do that so\n\n238\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.810\nI can get to that port, right on there.\n\n239\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.490\nSo it's not as easy to always attack\ninside hosts as it seems, right.\n\n240\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.230\nThere is some stuff that\nyou have to set up.\n\n241\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.680\nIn this case I haven't\nquite done that yet, but\n\n242\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.900\nanything that's gonna come in\nis gonna be denied right now.\n\n243\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.610\nBut let's go ahead and continue on\nwith this and get to that point\n\n244\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.080\nwhere I can go ahead and send some\nattacks and see that they're blocked.\n\n245\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.788\nIn this case here,\n\n246\n00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:13.250\nmy cali linux wasn't configured correctly\nwith the configuration to even do it.\n\n247\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.280\nSo I have to be a better\nhacker at this point.\n\n248\n00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.430\nSo how bad am I where I can't\neven get to the ASA to show you.\n\n249\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:25.010\nSo, terrible hacker,\nterrible, show policy-map.\n\n250\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.600\nSo, let's take a look here.\n\n251\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.120\nAll right, I'm sorry,\nshow run policy-map all.\n\n252\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.740\nSo, let's take a look at here.\n\n253\n00:12:34.818 --> 00:12:40.670\nIs it [LAUGH] show run all,\nshow run all policy-map.\n\n254\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.160\nWhat did I type in?\n\n255\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.220\nThought I had it right.\n\n256\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.630\nWhat did I type in last time, I forget?\n\n257\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.530\nThought I typed the right thing.\n\n258\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.870\nNonetheless, take a look here, guys,\nand what we're trying to get to, and\n\n259\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:54.520\nwhat I want to show you is that\nwhat we're inspecting by default.\n\n260\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.170\nNotice, so, here, it's show run all,\nI said show run policy-map all.\n\n261\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.635\nShow run all policy-map, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:07.030\nAnd so, first off, we're going to inspect\nDNS, so this is an engine that's set up,\n\n263\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:13.420\nyou have a DNS engine, we have an FTP\nengine, we can see some H323 for voice.\n\n264\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.520\nSo we'll automatically inspect these\nprotocols and we can see what to inspect.\n\n265\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.610\nFor example, on to the DNS,\n\n266\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:25.502\nthere's a preset that says the maximum\nlength of a DNS query is 512 bytes, right?\n\n267\n00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:29.280\nSo we're doing things like that, they\nhave other configurations that are here.\n\n268\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.710\nWe don't see this with the show run or\nshow policy-map.\n\n269\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.130\nWe see this show run all policy-map,\nright?\n\n270\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:41.807\nSo here's RTSP, IPV6,\n[LAUGH] of course, love our IPV6.\n\n271\n00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:46.310\nI can't wait to, there's a CCNA\ncoming out shortly or whenever and\n\n272\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.310\ndo a great IPV6 section, so\nyou guys get ready for that.\n\n273\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.265\nOkay, repeat after me,\nIPV6 is my friend, right.\n\n274\n00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:55.598\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love IPV6.\n\n275\n00:13:55.598 --> 00:13:57.280\nAll right, we're gonna come back to that.\n\n276\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.960\nAll right, so you can see that we're\ninspecting all the details, so we get\n\n277\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.880\nquite a bit of information here about all\nthese protocols that we're inspecting.\n\n278\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.860\nSo these different engines\nare very important to us.\n\n279\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.880\n>> And a key thing to remember\nthere is that the ones that Todd is\n\n280\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.600\nshowing us here.\n\n281\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.620\nWe turned on ICMP, but all of these\nother ones were on by default, right?\n\n282\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.080\nSo Cisco knows there's some\ncommon protocols like FTP\n\n283\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.750\nthat you very well may use, so\nthey go ahead and enable that.\n\n284\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.220\nAnd because it's a default command,\n\n285\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.130\nthat's why you don't see it in the running\nconfig until you do a show-run-config all.\n\n286\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.510\nAnd that's kind of something that\nyou just gotta remember is that\n\n287\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.940\nthere is functionality,\nit's on by default.\n\n288\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.250\nThat may be what you want.\n\n289\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.490\nOr you might actually want to come in and\nturn that off by default.\n\n290\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.810\nMaybe you don't want that program.\n\n291\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.130\nMaybe you don't use RTSP at all.\n\n292\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.600\nAnd so, why have that up and\nrunning, right?\n\n293\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.530\nAnd so you might wanna come in and tighten\nup that config, too, it's just up to you.\n\n294\n00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.270\n>> Yes.\n\n295\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.380\nOkay, so and we can see that and it's\nimportant I think, once you come in here.\n\n296\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.290\nI don't really use the alt command\nall that much once you look at it.\n\n297\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.026\nThe other thing is that we can look\nat the different, the class, and\n\n298\n00:14:56.026 --> 00:14:57.470\nwe can get into more detail on that.\n\n299\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.990\nSo show run all class map, right?\n\n300\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.200\nSo we can get more information\non those in that way.\n\n301\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.000\nBut in this case here, we can see the DNS.\n\n302\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.890\nHere's FTP.\n\n303\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.100\nSo it really, the engine does understand\nwhat you're going to do with that.\n\n304\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.380\nSo in this case here, remember, there\nis another thing I wanna show you guys.\n\n305\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.720\nI'm in the ASA.\n\n306\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.080\nAnd let's see where I'm at here.\n\n307\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.590\nI'll stay out on the outside, and\n\n308\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:27.700\nthe fact is that I can ping 10.11.12.250,\noops, I'm pinging myself.\n\n309\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.432\nPing 11.12.10, that's my interface,\nright, and we can see it.\n\n310\n00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.000\nConnection table is gonna come up and\nsay hey, someone's pinging me.\n\n311\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.190\nI don't want someone to ping me, my ASA,\nthey don't want it to know it's there.\n\n312\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.180\nInteresting thing about trace\nroute when we get to that,\n\n313\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.930\nwhat the ASA will do as well by default,\nbut in the meantime,\n\n314\n00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.690\nhow do I stop someone from pinging and\neven knowing that I'm there?\n\n315\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.190\nAnd the reality is it's on by default.\n\n316\n00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.813\nI'm kind of surprised but\nit should be often.\n\n317\n00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:53.380\nLet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n318\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:59.115\nSo I'm gonna say config t, and\nlet's see what we can do with ICMP.\n\n319\n00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:04.385\nLet me turn up, no log in console.\n\n320\n00:16:09.893 --> 00:16:10.820\nOkay.\n\n321\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.020\nSo, I'm going to say ICMP,\nlet's see what we can do with ICMP.\n\n322\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.420\nNow, we're not inspecting ICMP\nbecause we'd have to be under a class.\n\n323\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.680\nAnd we're not.\n\n324\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.800\nSo let's see what commands\nwe have on the ASA for ICMP.\n\n325\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.930\nOkay, first off it says will deny or\npermit or deny and\n\n326\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.050\npermit unreachables, right?\n\n327\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.936\nSo, what you wanna do is,\nso I might say deny.\n\n328\n00:16:29.936 --> 00:16:32.210\nOkay, and then it's gonna say a host name.\n\n329\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.270\nWell, I'm gonna be on my outside\ninterface, what's the host name?\n\n330\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.130\nWe'll deny China or something.\n\n331\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.340\nSo, the fact is deny any, any what?\n\n332\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.250\nAny coming in on an interface and\nnotice my name's here.\n\n333\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.990\nIt would not exist if I didn't\ncreate the interfaces first, so\n\n334\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.562\nI'm gonna just say outside.\n\n335\n00:16:48.562 --> 00:16:50.500\nAll right, so and\nI just had gone out there and pinged it.\n\n336\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.330\nSo let's go ahead and ping it again now,\nand notice I can't ping it anymore.\n\n337\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.970\nSo, the fact is, is that I stopped it.\n\n338\n00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.030\nIt's not even showing, I don't even\nhave log in on, so let's go ahead and\n\n339\n00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.660\nsee if I can.\n\n340\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.690\nThere it is.\n\n341\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.050\nSo now we can see that.\n\n342\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.742\nOkay, we're gonna go back to the types for\na second because I'm gonna show you this.\n\n343\n00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:12.830\nAll right, let me turn this off.\n\n344\n00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:13.805\nI don't know what I did here.\n\n345\n00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:18.670\n[LAUGH]\nSo now I turned this off but\n\n346\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.420\nwe can say I just turned\nlogin back on after I pinged.\n\n347\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.560\nAnd we blocked ping on the interface.\n\n348\n00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.140\nThat's all we have done.\n\n349\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.140\nSo now they're sitting there saying,\nsomeone is pinging your interface, right?\n\n350\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.060\nYou know, you're not gonna typically\n\n351\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.180\ngoing to see this in a production because\nyou're not watching your console.\n\n352\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.493\nI mean, you might have a cyslog and\nyou might say okay,\n\n353\n00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:35.810\nsomeone pinged my interface.\n\n354\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.950\nBut, that might be important\nto you because and\n\n355\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.240\nthat means someone knows your IP.\n\n356\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.130\nMaybe they're up to some shenanigans if\nthey're trying to do some research on you.\n\n357\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.800\n>> Yeah, normally what we see\nis it's the first step of\n\n358\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.950\na reconnaissance attack, right?\n\n359\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.170\nSo people are constantly scanning\nthe internet and they look for\n\n360\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.000\nIPs that respond, and\nonce they find an IP that responds,\n\n361\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.300\nthen they follow that up with a port scan,\nright?\n\n362\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.340\nBut if your IP never responds in the first\nplace, they don't bother with a port scan.\n\n363\n00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.060\nThey just move right on to the next IP.\n\n364\n00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.570\nSo it is a great way to skip past\nyou seeing that initial ping,\n\n365\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.700\nthat was the beginning of an attack,\ntypically.\n\n366\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.610\n>> Yes, he's absolutely right.\n\n367\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.170\nSo, let's take a look at this for\na second,\n\n368\n00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.410\nlet's dive a little bit deeper in here.\n\n369\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.300\nWe're gonna say what is this,\ncuz we looked at the code 0 and\n\n370\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.070\nthat was an echo of reply.\n\n371\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.060\nSo what's they type 8?\n\n372\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.940\nRight, let's go ahead and take a look,\nthings like that always interest me, and\n\n373\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.210\nI'm I always wanna know what those are,\nright?\n\n374\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.744\nICMP error codes, right?\n\n375\n00:18:23.744 --> 00:18:24.360\nIsn't that what we did?\n\n376\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.573\nCan't figure out how we\nlived before Google.\n\n377\n00:18:28.573 --> 00:18:32.334\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or Uber, either one.\n\n378\n00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:34.037\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] In between those two.\n\n379\n00:18:34.037 --> 00:18:35.840\n>> I was just telling him I\nwas in Manhattan last week.\n\n380\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.590\nI would have died.\n\n381\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.795\nIt was six degrees out and Uber comes\nup and picks you up at the door.\n\n382\n00:18:39.795 --> 00:18:41.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you don't have to get a cab.\n\n383\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.670\nStuff like that.\n\n384\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.390\nSo Google and Uber, man,\nchanged our lives for the good.\n\n385\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.910\nAll right, type A right here is an echo.\n\n386\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.610\nSo the error code, though, so\nwe came in here and the error code is 0.\n\n387\n00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.430\nIts normal router advertisement\nis telling me, so, or no code.\n\n388\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.950\nBut nonetheless, come in here and\nsay type A is my echo.\n\n389\n00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.780\nAnd that it was an error code of\n0 in there, so we look in here.\n\n390\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.160\nOkay, code 0, so you look that up and\nthen look for your error code.\n\n391\n00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.980\nOkay, but we knew that was gonna\nhappen because we're just denying ICMP\n\n392\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.610\non that interface, aren't we?\n\n393\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.380\n>> Right, and it also shows how when you\ndo a ping you're sending out an echo\n\n394\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.760\nrequest, or that echo and then getting\nan echo reply back from the other side.\n\n395\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.010\nAnd so here we're seeing that\ninitial echo and it's dying and\n\n396\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.160\nthere's no echo reply, right?\n\n397\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.490\nBecause it never actually made it to\nthe host and that's what we expect to see.\n\n398\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.833\n>> All right, so before we finish\nthis episode, okay, so that was ping,\n\n399\n00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:37.955\nwe allowed ping through,\nwe turn it off on the outside interface,\n\n400\n00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:41.132\nit's still on the inside interface,\nand I would like to use that for\n\n401\n00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:43.830\ndiagnostic purposes,\nmake sure that it's alive.\n\n402\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.029\nBut lets go ahead and go from here.\n\n403\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.084\nAnd let's do a trace route,\n10 11 11 11 from the outside.\n\n404\n00:19:55.084 --> 00:19:57.680\nLet's see, I think I still had log in on.\n\n405\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.562\nSo, it's trying to do it.\n\n406\n00:19:58.562 --> 00:20:02.650\n30 max hops is gonna sit there,\nand so check it out guys.\n\n407\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.240\nWhat protocol am I seeing, right?\n\n408\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.831\nIt says inbound UDP,\nbecause trace is using UDP coming in, and\n\n409\n00:20:11.831 --> 00:20:17.660\ndeny inbound UDP from\n10.11.12.250 to 10.11.11.11.\n\n410\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.420\nRight now, so\nwe can't do it from the outside in.\n\n411\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.690\nWe can't do anything from the outside in.\n\n412\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.760\nAll right, nothing.\n\n413\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.880\nWhat about from the inside out?\n\n414\n00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.246\nSo that was my calishost.\n\n415\n00:20:27.246 --> 00:20:28.026\nI don't mean to stop that.\n\n416\n00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.610\nI mean to stop this one.\n\n417\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.010\nThis isn't as easy to stop as you'd think,\nright?\n\n418\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.490\n[LAUGH] Kinda keeps\nrunning in the background.\n\n419\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.160\nLet's go to my inside host now.\n\n420\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.554\nLet me find my inside host.\n\n421\n00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:42.940\nOkay, getting there.\n\n422\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.440\nAnd let's do a trace.\n\n423\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.290\nIn Microsoft, you have to do their\nspecial trace, the only one in the world.\n\n424\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.460\nEveryone else uses trace, Rob.\n\n425\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.904\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This one drives me crazy.\n\n426\n00:20:49.904 --> 00:20:50.698\n>> There's too many levers.\n\n427\n00:20:50.698 --> 00:20:54.123\n>> Yeah, it's just like,\nI can't take it, I can't type the OUTE.\n\n428\n00:20:54.123 --> 00:20:58.082\nAll right, tracert 10.11.12.250,\nwhat do you think?\n\n429\n00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:01.433\nWhat are we going to get, [CROSSTALK] out.\n\n430\n00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:02.208\nYeah.\n\n431\n00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:06.180\nDoesn't look too happy right now,\nlet's go see what we see here.\n\n432\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.442\nFailed to locate egress interface for UDP.\n\n433\n00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:12.580\nAll right, so at this point here\nthat's not necessarily a problem.\n\n434\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.400\nThat's not our problem because if you\nlook at a little bit closer here,\n\n435\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.770\nwhat is it it trying to do?\n\n436\n00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.510\nThe first thing that trace route\nfrom Microsoft tries to do and\n\n437\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:25.810\nwe can see that it's actually starting\nto work, is that the reason that\n\n438\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.390\nwe got that is if you look closer here,\nwe want to see, where was that, up here?\n\n439\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.490\nHere it is, I'm sorry,\nit was up even further.\n\n440\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.970\nWhat's it trying to inspect here?\n\n441\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.320\nSo if we look, here it is, right here.\n\n442\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.250\nLet me see if I can highlight this.\n\n443\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.270\nFailed to locate egress,\nit was actually looking what, that's DNS.\n\n444\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.368\nSo this is what Microsoft, it says, okay,\n\n445\n00:21:52.368 --> 00:21:55.260\nthe first thing I wanna do\nis I wanna resolve the name.\n\n446\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.700\nThat's what it was trying to do.\n\n447\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.840\nAnd so\nI'm going from the inside out and then.\n\n448\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.500\nSo your host is going to try to resolve\nthe name and that's exactly what it did.\n\n449\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.520\nAnd it said it can't locate the egress,\nright?\n\n450\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.120\nI'm not even connected to that.\n\n451\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.050\nSo we haven't even configured routing to\nget to the internet or anything like that.\n\n452\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.304\nOr else it would have gone out and tried\nto resolve the name, but nonetheless,\n\n453\n00:22:13.304 --> 00:22:14.340\ndid it work?\n\n454\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:14.890\nI think it did.\n\n455\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.050\nSo, lets take a look.\n\n456\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.990\nIt said millisecond complete.\n\n457\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.750\nNow, we can go from the inside out,\nbut I can't do the outside in.\n\n458\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.850\nWe already tried that.\n\n459\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.210\nCheck this out though.\n\n460\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:30.689\nI'm on my inside host and it says,\nyeah, you can get 10, 11, 12, 250.\n\n461\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.250\nDo you see any hops?\n\n462\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.350\nIsn't that what trace route's\nall about is to tell me, so\n\n463\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.560\nping tells me the host is alive.\n\n464\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.900\nTrace Route tells me the path it\ntakes to get that remote host.\n\n465\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.020\nI did not get that path, did I?\n\n466\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.450\nThe ASA by default does not provide\nthat unreachable message, right?\n\n467\n00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.890\nIt will not return that for this reason.\n\n468\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.490\nSo that is set to default, right?\n\n469\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:57.390\nThe ASA will not respond to this, and\nprovide that path to people, to anyone.\n\n470\n00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.700\nIn this case here,\nit did work from the outside in.\n\n471\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.270\nThe reason it went real slow is it\nfelt like the Windows had to resolve\n\n472\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.330\nthe name first.\n\n473\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:10.130\nAnd then, when it couldn't do that,\nit went ahead and sent the UDP packet\n\n474\n00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.240\nwith the expecting an ICMP unreachable and\nthe time to limit exceeded.\n\n475\n00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.996\nThe ICMP unreachable is never sent from\nan ASA, that's the default setting.\n\n476\n00:23:19.996 --> 00:23:24.522\n>> Yeah, and ping, we use all the time for\ndiagnostics and troubleshooting,\n\n477\n00:23:24.522 --> 00:23:26.870\ntrace route, we use less frequently.\n\n478\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.660\nSo this might be something\nthat we want to enable or\n\n479\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.380\nthat we might want to leave disabled and\nturn it on when we need it.\n\n480\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.800\nBut, it is an important tool because not\nonly do you get to see your path but\n\n481\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.330\nyou get to see that average latency\nat each leg along the journey.\n\n482\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.920\nEspecially important when you're\ndealing with voice over IP networks.\n\n483\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.840\nSo, we dealing with some\nspecial case scenarios here,\n\n484\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.000\nsome protocols that are really tricky.\n\n485\n00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.480\nWe're kind of purposely staying\naway from the easy stuff though,\n\n486\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.880\naren't we Ty right, just like HTTP\nwhich would work just fine here because\n\n487\n00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.060\nit's a standard protocol that goes out and\ncomes back in the same ports.\n\n488\n00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.350\n>> Exactly, and again what I'm\ntrying to push is we wouldn't even\n\n489\n00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.420\nbe talking about this if\nyou didn't have anything,\n\n490\n00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.960\nsome specific application in this case\nwith the objectives that are like.\n\n491\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.720\nYou've got to understand the inspection\nengines and what they're for\n\n492\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.310\nand the different, the policy map,\nthe class map and the service policy.\n\n493\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.617\nAnd how those work and we'll get\na little bit more detail on that in the,\n\n494\n00:24:14.617 --> 00:24:17.665\nwe'll take a little bit closer and\nset up some more information.\n\n495\n00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:21.302\nNow, the one thing that we'll do in the\nnext episode, so you want to definitely\n\n496\n00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:24.451\nstick around, before he closes out here,\non the next episode we're\n\n497\n00:24:24.451 --> 00:24:28.780\ngonna poke a hole in the firewall because\nin this case here, I can ping out.\n\n498\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.740\nI can traceroute out.\n\n499\n00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.656\nSo I can do the same thing with any\napplications and get out and get back,\n\n500\n00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:37.788\nand if there's abnormal\napplications in the sense where\n\n501\n00:24:37.788 --> 00:24:41.979\nthey come back with different ports\nlike FTP, then we have to inspect them.\n\n502\n00:24:41.979 --> 00:24:45.170\nNow, FTP's on by default by ICMP wasn't,\nso.\n\n503\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.020\nOnce we turn that on,\nwe were able to actually work.\n\n504\n00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.360\nSo in the next episode we'll turn on some\nrounding, we'll get to the internet,\n\n505\n00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.610\nwe'll do some more inspection and\ntake a look at access lists.\n\n506\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.130\n>> Yeah, and then the reality is\nthat if you're in a small office or\n\n507\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.940\nhome office and you have no servers or\nanything like that behind the firewall,\n\n508\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.560\nit's just a couple of work stations hit\nthe firewall, go out to the internet.\n\n509\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.030\nThis may be all\nthe configuration you need.\n\n510\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.190\nYou might be able to stop this\nseries right here and say, boy,\n\n511\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.620\nthat was the best show I ever watched,\nI'm done.\n\n512\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.930\nBut the odds are you've got something\nthat's behind that firewall that's gonna\n\n513\n00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.850\nneed some access made available for it.\n\n514\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.730\nEven in a home you probably\nhave like a Roku or Xbox or\n\n515\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.890\nsomething that might need some ports open.\n\n516\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.650\nIn a business you're gonna have other\nthings, web servers, file servers,\n\n517\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:23.530\nstuff like that.\n\n518\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.340\nSo we need to do a lot more and\nwe haven't even scratched the tip\n\n519\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.030\nof the iceberg on things like firepower\nand the advanced security inside of this.\n\n520\n00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.870\nYou'll definitely want to stay tuned for\nthat.\n\n521\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.170\nBut as far as our initial configuration\ngoes, that pretty much wraps that one up.\n\n522\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.800\nStay tuned, we're going to be back\nwith more configuration to the ASA's\n\n523\n00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.930\nas we take a look at those firewall\nrules and additional configurations.\n\n524\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.630\nDefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n525\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.790\nBut as for this episode, that's a wrap.\n\n526\n00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.290\nSo signing off for\nitpro.tv, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n527\n00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.480\n>> And Todd Langley and\nthanks for joining us.\n\n528\n00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.338\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n529\n00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:59.170\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.321\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.080\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.470\nback again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.550\nAnd in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.320\nwe're gonna be continuing on with the\ninitial configuration of our ASA devices.\n\n8\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.490\nIn the first couple episodes\nwe saw assigning IP addresses.\n\n9\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.140\nWe saw working with our security policy\nto make sure that we could allow our\n\n10\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.740\npings to pass through the router from the,\nwell, we did from the inside out, right?\n\n11\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.330\nAnd we kinda ended the last episode\ndealing with the fact that we still\n\n12\n00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.930\ncouldn't get any traffic from the outside\nin, which is actually a good thing, right?\n\n13\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.440\nBut we may want to allow some\nof that traffic to come in.\n\n14\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.920\nAnd the way we're going to do\nthat is with an access list.\n\n15\n00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700\nAnd that's what we're going to take a look\nat here in this episode as we kind of\n\n16\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.470\ncomplete the initial\nconfiguration of our ASAs.\n\n17\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.700\nAnd here to help me in the studio is Mr.\nTodd Lammle.\n\n18\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.940\nTodd, thanks for being back on the show.\n\n19\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.720\nAnd where do we want to get started?\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.300\n>> Yeah, so we were taking a look.\n\n21\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020\nAnd from our inside host we were\nable to get to the outside.\n\n22\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.460\nAnd we weren't be able to\nget from the outside in.\n\n23\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.970\nSo I can go back out to the outside here,\nif you guys remember where we were here.\n\n24\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.820\nAnd we can see that I cannot trace.\n\n25\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.880\nAnd I don't have a login on in here.\n\n26\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.580\nLet's go ahead and\njust remember where we were here.\n\n27\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.850\nAnd then logging on, right?\n\n28\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.020\nSo we talked about that.\n\n29\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560\nAnd we're denying the UDP\npackets here from this host.\n\n30\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.370\nAnd unlike the Windows host,\nit doesn't try to resolve the name.\n\n31\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.990\nAnd that was a kind of\nan issue that we saw, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.130\nIt takes a long time Windows\nhost to do a traceroute because\n\n33\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920\nthe first thing we're\ndoing is resolving names.\n\n34\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.877\nAnyway, so taking a look here,\nthe easiest way to do this,\n\n35\n00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:42.436\nthere's a couple different\nthings that we can do.\n\n36\n00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.220\nBut we can create an access list.\n\n37\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.065\nSo let's talk about access lists for\na second.\n\n38\n00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:51.250\nAnd see if i can get that up a little bit.\n\n39\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.190\nOkay so access lists, the one thing we\nneed to remember, I'm not gonna get\n\n40\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.710\ninto this huge long discussion with access\nlists, not what this course is about.\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.329\nWe need to remember that\nthere is a deny ip in any, or\n\n42\n00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.770\ndeny any at the end of at an access list,\njust like iOS.\n\n43\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.430\nWe don't have to use the protocol\nin the access list command.\n\n44\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.790\nWe just say access list.\n\n45\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.820\nNo difference between standard and\nextended.\n\n46\n00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.800\nSo we just say access list and\nthen we do give it a name, though.\n\n47\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.090\nSo we are going to name it.\n\n48\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.210\nSo take a look here.\n\n49\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.838\nSo I have access lists.\n\n50\n00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:30.270\nAccess lists, I'm gonna say I'm\ngonna allow the outside in.\n\n51\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.450\nNow, I'm doing a pretty broad one here,\nyou might wanna be careful here.\n\n52\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.090\nAnd so we're gonna say permit.\n\n53\n00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.776\nNow, if I just said permit any, right?\n\n54\n00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.370\nSo let me turn logging off here.\n\n55\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.837\nNo logging console.\n\n56\n00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:48.920\nOkay.\n\n57\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.080\nOkay, so I, oops, let me go back up.\n\n58\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.230\nOkay, so, what did I crown?\n\n59\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.870\nOkay, it says duplicate\na name here basically.\n\n60\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.250\nBut basically what did I create here?\n\n61\n00:02:58.405 --> 00:02:59.660\n>> You created a standard ACL right?\n\n62\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.225\nCuz we only provided one piece of\ninformation to it and it's not enough.\n\n63\n00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:04.707\nWell I guess it is enough\nif that's what you want.\n\n64\n00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.095\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well it kind of is enough,\n\n65\n00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.685\nbut it's not gonna allow me to\ndo this on an outside interface.\n\n66\n00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:10.205\nIf we put this on here,\nwe can get an error.\n\n67\n00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:11.567\nI could show you that but\nit's just an error.\n\n68\n00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:13.967\nAnother error,\nwe've got plenty of those going around.\n\n69\n00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.487\nBut anyways, so the fact is is that\n\n70\n00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:20.777\nwe really need to make an extended access\nlist, so again there's no difference.\n\n71\n00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:23.897\nI don't have to type anything different,\nit's just how I type the line out, right?\n\n72\n00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:28.962\nSo in this case here, I'm gonna say clear\n\n73\n00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:33.465\nconfig access-list OUTSIDE_IN.\n\n74\n00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:36.880\nclick configure OUTSIDE_IN, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.660\nSo, I could do show run access list and\nsee that it's gone, all right.\n\n76\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.000\nNow, in this case here lets go back and\nwe'll create an extended access list.\n\n77\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.276\nAgain, it's not much difference\nin the sense of the format,\n\n78\n00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:54.074\naccess-list OUTSIDE_IN is\nagain just how I type it.\n\n79\n00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:56.620\nSo I'm gonna say permit ip any any.\n\n80\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.256\nNow, I go out to customers and\nwhen someone has a problem and\n\n81\n00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:04.041\nit's Friday afternoon and\nthey wanna get home or something,\n\n82\n00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:06.462\na lot of times I'll go out to their ASA.\n\n83\n00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:08.850\nAnd I'll see this is the first\nline in their list, right?\n\n84\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.470\nBecause, does it solve their problem?\n\n85\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.820\nSure it does.\n\n86\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.530\nAnd then they meant to come back and\n\n87\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.820\nsolve it later cuz they had to go to the\nSuper Bowl, or whatever they were doing.\n\n88\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.730\nAnd this problem-solves a lot of issues.\n\n89\n00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.254\nSo be careful with this one though, right?\n\n90\n00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:24.699\nSo I think you guys know\nwhere I'm going with this.\n\n91\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.120\nNow I don't go to\nan interface to apply this.\n\n92\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.950\nAnd again I'm doing\nsomething very global here.\n\n93\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.462\nI use the access-group command and\nthe name.\n\n94\n00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.070\nIn interface outside, right?\n\n95\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.750\nIs that right?\n\n96\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.270\nWhat did I miss?\n\n97\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.355\nI spelled access group wrong.\n\n98\n00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:48.129\nSure did.\n\n99\n00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.615\nIt might have been easier to type it out.\n\n100\n00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:56.030\n>> [LAUGH] It's the syntax\nthat gets you every time.\n\n101\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.350\n>> So I basically took that access list\nand put that on the outside interface.\n\n102\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.429\nSo let's go see if that worked.\n\n103\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.910\nI'm pretty sure it will.\n\n104\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.940\nSImplest way to poke\na hole in your firewall.\n\n105\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.120\nSo why are we doing this to you?\n\n106\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120\nI don't want you to type\nthis command in production.\n\n107\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.170\nYou can easily be a little more\nspecific with your extended\n\n108\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.770\nx list as you guys are all\naware of how to do those.\n\n109\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.180\nWe're gonna talk about,\nwhen we'd use protocols and so on.\n\n110\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.530\nIn this case here we're just\ntrying to get something done here.\n\n111\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.820\nSo if I trace route now we\nshould see that this would work.\n\n112\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.760\nLet me turn log in back on and\nsee if I did this right.\n\n113\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.190\nLet's just say i'm logging on.\n\n114\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.590\nOkay, it definitely worked, I missed it.\n\n115\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.750\nOkay, so it came back pretty quick,\nlet's see and there we go.\n\n116\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.040\nSo now we're building an impound so\nthat we can now see that,\n\n117\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.570\nthat's the easiest way to pull up a hole\nout there and the reason you would\n\n118\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.250\ndo something like this is at the beginning\nhere, you're playing, you're learning.\n\n119\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.250\nThe other things is you have\na specific application, and\n\n120\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.590\nyou're typing in the port numbers, typing\nin the protocols, and you wanna test this.\n\n121\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.470\nYou gonna probably make it global,\nand then you're gonna tighten it up.\n\n122\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.680\nSo that way,\nyou can base your troubleshooting and\n\n123\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.710\nnarrow down your troubleshooting focus.\n\n124\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.410\nAll right so show local-host,\nor show local-host all,\n\n125\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.150\nthat's gonna show me my connection\ntable and see what we're doing.\n\n126\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.790\nSo we can see it's UDP coming from\nthe outside going to the inside,\n\n127\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.860\nin this case here.\n\n128\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.270\nAnd that we're getting a lot\nof information here, so\n\n129\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.450\nI can come back here and\nsee that we have one active connection.\n\n130\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.740\nProbably gonna get a lot.\n\n131\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.620\nIf this is a production, we'll see that\nwe have a lot of connections here.\n\n132\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.750\nSo we wanna be careful with this\nlogging command that I'm using.\n\n133\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.320\nSo if we're gonna use this, probably\nbest maybe push it off to a syslog.\n\n134\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.020\nTrying to see everything on your\nconsole is gonna be pretty rough.\n\n135\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.660\nSo in this case here,\nlet me make sure this is done here.\n\n136\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.110\nOkay we should be good and\nthat's my outside host.\n\n137\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.820\nAll right so\nthat being said one other thing before,\n\n138\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.748\nI gotta show you a couple more things and\nI'm gonna run to some slides here.\n\n139\n00:06:49.748 --> 00:06:57.110\nAnd so we talked about the policy map and\nhow to make it global and\n\n140\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.660\nfirst thing we do is we create our classes\nand this tells us what to expect right.\n\n141\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.670\nShow run all class map.\n\n142\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.070\nLet's take a look at that because\nthat's a pretty cool command.\n\n143\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:12.380\nAnd I'll make this bigger after I\ntype it in, show run all class map.\n\n144\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.880\nSee if I can type today, I cannot.\n\n145\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.470\nSo now this is gonna give us the more\ndetails about the default class map that\n\n146\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.270\nwe're using, and\nyou can specifically create class maps.\n\n147\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.040\nSo remember we create a class map,\nwe define what we're going to inspect.\n\n148\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.863\nYou can see my cali Linux is\nstill trying something here.\n\n149\n00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:34.770\n[LAUGH] We're gotta give Cali Linux\nthe little doesn't give up hope.\n\n150\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.340\n>> It's always trying to do something,\nright?\n\n151\n00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.430\nThat's kind of the point.\n\n152\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.980\nIt attacks software.\n\n153\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.775\n>> It really does, and in the cases that\nWindows is always sending broadcasts and\n\n154\n00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:47.320\nCali''s always just trying\nto connect Alright.\n\n155\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.801\nI forget where I was.\n\n156\n00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.712\n[LAUGH]\n>> You were showing the policy map.\n\n157\n00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:52.421\n>> I'm showing the class map.\n\n158\n00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:53.879\nSo inside our policy map.\n\n159\n00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.463\nAgain I'm just using the global\npolicy it's just a container.\n\n160\n00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:59.213\nThat contains my class maps which\ntell me what I'm inspecting.\n\n161\n00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:02.788\nSo you can make as many class maps\nyou want and then your policy map and\n\n162\n00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:06.850\nthen your service policy is how you\nattach those to your interfaces.\n\n163\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.274\nAgain the easiest way, just use\nthe defaults and add to your classmat or\n\n164\n00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:12.810\nadd another classmat and\nwe'll do that again in a minute.\n\n165\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.900\nBut we can see here that some of\nthe stuff that we're looking for\n\n166\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.430\nin this default class map, I wanted\nto get a little bit more detail here.\n\n167\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.890\nThis is the regular expression so\n\n168\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.160\nit's looking for some stuff here,\nwhat it's doing.\n\n169\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.880\nAnd we can see it's like GoToMyPC.\n\n170\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.990\nLike we're going to be looking at that in\nthe parameters or something like that.\n\n171\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.937\nLet's see if I, did I turn off login or\ndo I have it on?\n\n172\n00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.234\nLogging on.\n\n173\n00:08:36.234 --> 00:08:39.919\nAll right, so let's go back here for\na second, and\n\n174\n00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.967\nsee now that I'm out there and\nI should be able to get in.\n\n175\n00:08:43.967 --> 00:08:49.140\nNow that I got my access list,\nsee if it launches an attack.\n\n176\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.624\nSo this is my Kali Linux here.\n\n177\n00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:55.710\nYeah, looks like it, eh, it didn't\ndo it quite yet, I still need to do.\n\n178\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.130\nSo that's gonna bring us up to our next\nsection, which will be our routing and\n\n179\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.270\nthen our net.\n\n180\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.592\nSo once we can fix all this and\nallow routing through.\n\n181\n00:09:05.592 --> 00:09:07.770\nAnd basically we're just trying\nto get from the outside in.\n\n182\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.540\nSo if someone is attacking you,\n\n183\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.960\nthey still have to figure out how\nto get into your network, right?\n\n184\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.960\nAnd we haven't allowed that yet, might I\nsay, remember is only directly connected\n\n185\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.060\nto a network, so\nit's not even connected to the Internet.\n\n186\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.970\nSo let's talk about routing for a second.\n\n187\n00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.910\nSo if I come back over here and\nlet me go through a couple more slides.\n\n188\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.970\nRemember, so policy map, create a policy.\n\n189\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.910\nThe classes define what you're doing and\n\n190\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.810\nthen apply to your interfaces\nwith the service policy.\n\n191\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.440\nIt's not that hard, my friends.\n\n192\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.950\nAll right, so, really, three steps.\n\n193\n00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.720\nDefine what you're gonna inspect,\nput it into a container,\n\n194\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.330\nand put it on your interfaces, all right?\n\n195\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.240\nAnd remember,\nI think we talked about ICMP,\n\n196\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.140\nthat you can ping your interfaces\non your ASA by default, right?\n\n197\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.190\nSo how do we stop that from happening\nbecause we don't want someone to ping our\n\n198\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.320\noutside interface, right?\n\n199\n00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.310\nNow again, when you're first\nputting your ASA in, you do, right,\n\n200\n00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.730\nbecause we're troubleshoot making for\nconnectivity.\n\n201\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.980\nBut what happens after we\ngot everything working?\n\n202\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.710\n>> Then you can turn it off.\n\n203\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.079\nIt's kind of like CDP,\nwhere you turn it on when you need it,\n\n204\n00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.922\n[CROSSTALK] you turn it off when you\ndon't need it and that's how this is.\n\n205\n00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:07.786\n>> I love CDP.\n\n206\n00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:12.760\n[LAUGH]\nSo too many times I've been called out\n\n207\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.405\nwhere the networking manager's left or\npassed away or something, if I had to,\n\n208\n00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:23.040\nand true stories, I've had to go out and\ndraw up the networks in CDP.\n\n209\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.560\nI'm coming off subject here.\n\n210\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.340\nBut CDP can really help you a lot,\nit really does help.\n\n211\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.811\nSo this isn't a CDP, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and, a CDP class.\n\n212\n00:10:31.811 --> 00:10:33.806\n[LAUGH] Anyways, we're gonna go out and\n\n213\n00:10:33.806 --> 00:10:38.260\nwe're gonna turn off ICMP on our outside\nwith the ICMP deny any outside, right.\n\n214\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.680\nAnd so that was one of the things\nwe did from global config.\n\n215\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.410\nWe allowed to inspect\nICMP under the class.\n\n216\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.990\nAnd that's fine.\n\n217\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.800\nOn the class map we inspected ICMP.\n\n218\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.604\nThen we disabled that\nyesterday in our session.\n\n219\n00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:55.483\nAll right, again,\nnow we can do some advanced parameters.\n\n220\n00:10:55.483 --> 00:10:59.141\nOne of the things you want to remember for\nthe exam objectives is that we kind of\n\n221\n00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:03.050\nwant to be a little bit more succinct,\nspecifically than what we've been doing.\n\n222\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.450\nI'm doing everything in kind\nof a big broad section here.\n\n223\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.462\nWe wanna set connection advanced options\nand so that way, we use that command and\n\n224\n00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:15.510\nthen create a tcp-map to create\nsome manual TCP policies.\n\n225\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.910\nAll right, so this is gonna\nallow us to be more detailed.\n\n226\n00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.610\nYou can look more into this but\nremember to, if you're studying for\n\n227\n00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.000\nyour express security exam,\nyou wanna remember this command.\n\n228\n00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.530\nSet connection advanced options and then\ncreate a tcp-map naming it whatever, and\n\n229\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.651\nthen put your parameters under there.\n\n230\n00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:36.601\nAnd this will allow specific\ncustomized applications using\n\n231\n00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.574\nTCP to come in, and-\n>> And that's becoming more and\n\n232\n00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.841\nmore popular these days, cuz there's a lot\nof inspections that are built in for\n\n233\n00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:44.135\nFTP and ICMP and those things.\n\n234\n00:11:44.135 --> 00:11:48.057\nBut when you have no JS applications or\nthings that are using Socket.IO, they open\n\n235\n00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:51.940\nup connections on all sorts of ports, and\nthe firewall needs to be aware of those.\n\n236\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.510\nSo creating a custom map is gonna\nbe something you'll have to do.\n\n237\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n238\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.940\nAnd they're gonna make sure that you\ncan do that for your exam objectives.\n\n239\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.498\nAll right, now one of the things that Don\nand I wanted to share with you is we were\n\n240\n00:12:03.498 --> 00:12:08.402\ntalking about this earlier today, is like\nhair panning or a way to, when you VPN in,\n\n241\n00:12:08.402 --> 00:12:10.705\ndon't you come in the same interface?\n\n242\n00:12:10.705 --> 00:12:12.705\nAnd then you're gonna go\nback out the same interface.\n\n243\n00:12:12.705 --> 00:12:14.005\nI think you were elaborating\non that earlier.\n\n244\n00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:15.305\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a few different scenarios.\n\n245\n00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:17.305\nNormally when you think of a firewall or\neven a router,\n\n246\n00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:21.015\nyou think of coming in one interface and\ngoing out a different interface, right?\n\n247\n00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:22.133\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n248\n00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:26.244\nSo for example, if you have two users\nthat are VPNed into your firewall, right,\n\n249\n00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:29.890\njust remote access VPN or SSL VPN,\nor whatever way they're doing it.\n\n250\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.800\nSo you have the two users come in.\n\n251\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.790\nWhat if the two users\nwanna talk to each other?\n\n252\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.640\nTechnically the traffic is coming in\none interface and going right back out\n\n253\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.140\nthe same interface, and that's called\nhair pinning like a hair pin turn, and\n\n254\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.260\nit's not allowed by default,\nit's turned off.\n\n255\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.380\nAnd we have to turn that on if we want it.\n\n256\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.270\nAnd similarly, if I have two interfaces\nat the same security level, right,\n\n257\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.425\nthen they're gonna have the same problem.\n\n258\n00:12:51.425 --> 00:12:53.330\nThat communication's\nnot allowed by default.\n\n259\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.060\nI know we talked about it in an earlier\nepisode, where we said if you have\n\n260\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.620\na higher security level, you can talk to\na lower security level, that's allowed.\n\n261\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.740\nBut two people at the same security level,\nwe didn't really mention.\n\n262\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.630\nAnd I know what you're saying,\nwe just never would do that, right?\n\n263\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.870\nBut anytime you add a new interface,\nit defaults to zero.\n\n264\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.410\nAnd so you could have many interfaces all\nat a default security level of zero and\n\n265\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.190\nthey can't talk to each other and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n266\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.940\nBut if you want them\nto talk to each other,\n\n267\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.070\nwe've gotta turn on this global\noption that'll allow that.\n\n268\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.870\nSo these are two kind\nof important options.\n\n269\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.120\n>> Exactly, so let's take a different look\nat both of these cuz you may use both.\n\n270\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.010\nWe're gonna certainly one when we get to\nthe VPN section when we do hairpinning in\n\n271\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.575\nan episode coming up.\n\n272\n00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:33.535\nsame-security-traffic-permit, know\nit's a global command.\n\n273\n00:13:33.535 --> 00:13:37.315\ninter-interface allows two interfaces\nwith the same security level to now\n\n274\n00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:38.470\ncommunicate.\n\n275\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.977\nSo probably just turn that on, it's pretty\nrare that you probably wouldn't want that\n\n276\n00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:44.150\nso there might be something\nyou always wanna turn on.\n\n277\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.319\nThe other one is for\n\n278\n00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:50.530\nthe hair pinning is the intra-interface\nwhere we can come in and come out so.\n\n279\n00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.380\nAll right,\nnow remember the old xlate command.\n\n280\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.230\nYou remember that?\n\n281\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.330\nSo now we've got the show local-host\nthat we've shown you guys that already.\n\n282\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.756\nDid our access list and let's take a look\nat a little more deeper access list,\n\n283\n00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:03.504\nfor example Jack Tousseau.\n\n284\n00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:07.110\nLet's take a look at\na business objective and\n\n285\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.450\nsee how we can solve that\nin two different ways.\n\n286\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.560\nOkay, so there's two different commands.\n\n287\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.800\nIt says an inside client on the 10\nnetwork connects to an outside server on\n\n288\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.580\nthe 172.16 network using TCP in\nthe server port of 2001, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.730\nVery common.\n\n290\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.923\nSomething like this,\n\n291\n00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:26.835\nthe inside client negotiates a client port\nin the range using UDP from 5000 to 5500.\n\n292\n00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:30.166\nOkay, so this is something what you're\nup against in your exam objectives and\n\n293\n00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:33.840\neven at work, something like this you\nwanna understand proprietary applications.\n\n294\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.390\nSo there's two different\nways to solve this.\n\n295\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.860\nThe first one is to create an access list.\n\n296\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.340\nSo, access-list,\nI'm staying on the INSIDE.\n\n297\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.703\nLine 1 means put it to the top,\nso you don't have to have that,\n\n298\n00:14:43.703 --> 00:14:47.262\nthat's not necessary,\nin this case here we're going to the top.\n\n299\n00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:52.529\nPermit tcp network 10,\ngoing to network 172.16 eq 2001.\n\n300\n00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:56.300\nAnd then put this as an access-group\non your INSIDE interface.\n\n301\n00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.640\nPretty straightforward.\n\n302\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.150\nThat is a solution to this\nbusiness requirement.\n\n303\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.690\nThere is another way to do this\nwith one line, and again for\n\n304\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.210\nyour objectives you wanna know this one.\n\n305\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.030\nActually I probably use this one more than\nthe access-list, because it's so simple.\n\n306\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.006\nAnd then when I look at my configuration,\n\n307\n00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:15.607\nthen I pretty much have all my\ncustom applications in one place.\n\n308\n00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:20.529\nSo it's the establish command,\nestablished tcp 2001 permits\n\n309\n00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:24.769\nsomeone using udp as\na source from 5000 and 5500.\n\n310\n00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:25.381\nAll right, so\n\n311\n00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:28.803\nthis command allows you term connections\nfrom a lower security level to a higher\n\n312\n00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:32.350\nsecurity level that's already established\na connection in these port range.\n\n313\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.430\nAll right,\nthis is important that we understand this,\n\n314\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.950\nthat we can resolve a business,\nwhat am I thinking?\n\n315\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.129\n>> A business use case, right?\n\n316\n00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:46.354\nSo a great example would be VOIP, where\nSIP is a great example where it creates\n\n317\n00:15:46.354 --> 00:15:50.462\na TCP session initially but then it\nflips over to all these weird UDP ports.\n\n318\n00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:50.962\n>> Yes.\n\n319\n00:15:50.962 --> 00:15:52.390\n>> And we wanna permit that through.\n\n320\n00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.787\n>> Absolutely.\nThat is a great example,\n\n321\n00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.004\nthank you You see I knew that\nthat's why it going to you guys.\n\n322\n00:15:56.004 --> 00:15:56.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n323\n00:15:56.979 --> 00:15:58.545\nI wanna mention something to you guys.\n\n324\n00:15:58.545 --> 00:16:00.821\nWe're gonna go back to\nthe ASA after this slide, but\n\n325\n00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:03.900\nI wanna mention that there's\ndifferent routing protocols, right?\n\n326\n00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.040\nJust router RIP, router EIGRP, whatever,\nit supports all those and that's great.\n\n327\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.366\nSome of these are relatively new,\nlike EIGRP for example, but\n\n328\n00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:13.336\nthe newest one actually that\nthey're allowing is BGP.\n\n329\n00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:15.960\nAnd they didn't allow it cause\nit's a lot of processing, right?\n\n330\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.860\nSo we definitely have BGP on the screen,\nbut wait.\n\n331\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.480\nIf we're talking about the ASA\nexpress security, it's not the answer.\n\n332\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.310\nYour answer is what four\nrouting protocols or\n\n333\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.610\nunicast protocols would the ASA support?\n\n334\n00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:34.400\nWell, on the ASA express exam objectives,\nthe answer is RIP, EIGRP,\n\n335\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.050\nOSPF, and bidirectional PIM.\n\n336\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.170\nSo, basically we didn't have BPG for\n\n337\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.810\nthese objectives so\njust keep that in mind, all right?\n\n338\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.250\nSo your answer is multicast PIM or\nbidirectional PIM right?\n\n339\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.150\nAll right so\nconfiguration of that is extremely simple.\n\n340\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.330\nConfiguration of all these\nrouted protocols is simple.\n\n341\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.990\nWe're gonna show you in the next\nepisode on how to use ASTM and\n\n342\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.230\none of the things we'll do is configure\nrouting protocols through that just\n\n343\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.450\nto show you that you can.\n\n344\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.019\nBut I honestly the easiest way to do\nrouting protocols is through the command\n\n345\n00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:04.423\nline interface, all right?\n\n346\n00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:09.724\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look here, and I'm gonna say.\n\n347\n00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:14.094\nStill have logging and\nI'm gonna say no logging con.\n\n348\n00:17:14.094 --> 00:17:18.154\nAll right, so turning the logging on and\noff when you're first creating is great,\n\n349\n00:17:18.154 --> 00:17:19.960\nobviously, as you can tell.\n\n350\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.750\nBut I'd say router and\nis this gonna tell me hey,\n\n351\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.940\nif this was my exam question what\nrouting protocols can you support?\n\n352\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.470\nThe answer is these ports here but\nremember I'm running a newer code.\n\n353\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.570\nAll right, so basically let's talk about\none more thing, so let's go ahead and put\n\n354\n00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.646\nsome routes in because remember I went out\nthere I couldn't get from my outside in.\n\n355\n00:17:40.646 --> 00:17:45.298\nWe're directly connected but\nI wanted to do some other work and\n\n356\n00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:48.360\nallow other packets through my ASA.\n\n357\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.190\nSo we need to set up some sort of routing.\n\n358\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.710\nSo I can turn on OSPF or\nsomething for example.\n\n359\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.330\nBut basically I just want to get from my\nmanagement interface to my inside network,\n\n360\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.420\nand from my inside\nnetwork to the internet.\n\n361\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.450\nSo pretty basic.\n\n362\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.980\nSo we'll do a static route for that for\n\n363\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.330\nmy management because\nthe way my network is set up.\n\n364\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.750\nAnd then typically, what you'll do\nis you'll set up a default route.\n\n365\n00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.720\nSo we'll take a look at\nboth of those right now.\n\n366\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.612\nOkay, so I want to route,\nwhere did I put my notes here?\n\n367\n00:18:15.612 --> 00:18:19.800\nHere we go, route for my network.\n\n368\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:27.800\nSo I'm looking here,\nroute inside 10.11.10.0 using this mask.\n\n369\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.526\nSend it to a 10.11.11.1.\n\n370\n00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.840\nNow, we use a metric here.\n\n371\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.210\nSo if I look at this, we can see\nthe metric, 1 through 285 and so on.\n\n372\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.892\nAnd so on, and\nyou don't want to set anything to 285, or\n\n373\n00:18:36.892 --> 00:18:38.400\nwhy bother typing it in?\n\n374\n00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.507\nBut [LAUGH] the point is.\n\n375\n00:18:39.507 --> 00:18:41.896\nSo we're gonna just say everything\nis kinda of one hop away.\n\n376\n00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:45.200\nBut you can manipulate that if\nyou wanted to, I typically don't.\n\n377\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.370\nAnd then we're going to\ncreate our default route.\n\n378\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.810\nSo, pretty straight forward this isn't\na routing class, although we'll go over\n\n379\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.470\na couple of them in the ASTM, just doing\nsome basic stuff to get us working,\n\n380\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.770\nroute to the outside interface,\ndefault route,\n\n381\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.410\nand I'm using 10.11.12.1 and again we're\njust going to say it's the next log.\n\n382\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.036\nAll right, so now but wait I've got a DMZ,\nif you guys remember I created that and\n\n383\n00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:13.021\nsaying to get to 10.22.0.\n\n384\n00:19:15.274 --> 00:19:20.278\n172.16.10.1, okay and he's one hop away.\n\n385\n00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:23.607\nWhat did I do wrong here,\nI did that again.\n\n386\n00:19:23.607 --> 00:19:27.800\n[LAUGH] I don't like my twos today.\n\n387\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.630\nSo let's do that again.\n\n388\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.570\nAll right, and then how do we see it?\n\n389\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.212\nWell on the iOS we show IP router or\nshow IPv6 route.\n\n390\n00:19:34.212 --> 00:19:37.040\nIn this case it's just show route, right?\n\n391\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.030\nSo we're gonna do the show route and\n\n392\n00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.220\nwe can see our default route with the\nasterisk, we have gateway of last resort\n\n393\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.450\nand our static route that we\nhave created for our management.\n\n394\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.240\nAnd now we can be able to get out, and\nlet's see if now if I can come back here.\n\n395\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.650\nOkay, and get that in the middle.\n\n396\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:20:00.740\nLet's see, wanna see what this\nattack does when I have that done.\n\n397\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.120\nAnd, so it's running in the background,\nit's trying, and I still didn't get to it.\n\n398\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.180\nBecause we still need\nto do one more thing.\n\n399\n00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:09.770\n>> That's right.\n>> Right?\n\n400\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.950\n>> We've set the route in place, but just\nbecause the route's there doesn't mean\n\n401\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.100\nthe traffic's necessarily gonna\nflow through the interfaces, right?\n\n402\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.760\n>> That's right,\nwe still wanna do our nav translations.\n\n403\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.200\nRight, so, we've set up our IP addresses,\nwe did our names.\n\n404\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.840\nI can go all the way back.\n\n405\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.610\nRight, we did everything right.\n\n406\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.580\nWe set our access list.\n\n407\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.982\nAnd we set our route and\n\n408\n00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:30.500\nthe other thing that you're going to have\nto do is your network address translation.\n\n409\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.830\nSo let's take a look at that now.\n\n410\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.860\nOn the NAT it uses something called\nobjects, also called auto NAT.\n\n411\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.500\nVery cool, what they came out with,\nstarted with 8.6, I believe.\n\n412\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.550\nAnyways, we're at 9.4 and the fact is,\nis that it's also referred to as Auto NAT,\n\n413\n00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.769\nit allows us to create NAT and it\n\n414\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.980\ndetermines the best translation\nbased on the most detailed, right?\n\n415\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.330\nSo, if I was to create detailed\nmanual NAT statements over a broad,\n\n416\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.110\nglobal translation,\nit would use the detailed first.\n\n417\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.190\nSo, Auto NAT is very cool.\n\n418\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.290\nBefore we had Auto NAT,\nwe had to do a lot more work,\n\n419\n00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.740\nand code what was at A3 or below.\n\n420\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.195\nWe had to do a lot more work, especially\nwhen we did something called global or\n\n421\n00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:14.337\npolicy NAT, and\nthat's now called twice NAT.\n\n422\n00:21:14.337 --> 00:21:20.553\nThat allows me to go out to a, for\nexample, a host, create using services and\n\n423\n00:21:20.553 --> 00:21:24.680\ngo to the same host using different ports,\nright?\n\n424\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.510\nSo that's referred to as now twice NAT,\nright, or policy NAT.\n\n425\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.157\nAll right, now, that being said,\nlet's take a look at some quick objects,\n\n426\n00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.403\nwe'll take a look at some objects.\n\n427\n00:21:33.403 --> 00:21:36.500\nWe're not gonna do a huge\nconfiguration on that.\n\n428\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.510\nLet's get enough done to make this work,\nright, and then show you how easy it is\n\n429\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.580\nto get this working for,\nif you have an ASA to get to the Internet.\n\n430\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.956\nSo first thing I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna global config and\n\n431\n00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:49.929\nI wanna create an object.\n\n432\n00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:53.110\nSo I'm gonna say object ?,\na little bigger here.\n\n433\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.120\nAnd we can see we can create a network or\na service.\n\n434\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.680\nIn this case here I wanna\ncreate a network and\n\n435\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.640\nI'm going to actually\ncreate a host object, okay?\n\n436\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.950\nSo I'm gonna say this a network.\n\n437\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:12.110\nNow, I can go ahead and\ntype in the IP address of this host.\n\n438\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.680\nNow, the thing is is this is an object.\n\n439\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.690\nIn other words, I'm gonna use\nthis within my NAT statements.\n\n440\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.450\nSo if I have it as an IP address and\nI'm looking at these NAT statements,\n\n441\n00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.665\ndo I know that it's an object,\nknow it's an IP address?\n\n442\n00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:27.025\nWell, the answer is yes and no,\nbecause if I look at something and\n\n443\n00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:30.693\nit doesn't have a mass, then,\nit has to be an object.\n\n444\n00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:34.050\nHowever, it's easier when you do\nsomething like this obj, right?\n\n445\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:38.390\nSo, I know now, that 10.11.11,\nthis is actually an object, and\n\n446\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.840\nnot an IP address that\nwe're actually using.\n\n447\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.110\nSo now underneath here,\nI have my configuration object network and\n\n448\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.458\nlets see what we can do to this object,\nright?\n\n449\n00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:52.710\nAnd so in this point here I can say,\nokay we're gonna be a subnet, or\n\n450\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.430\nwe're gonna add a host here.\n\n451\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.000\nVery simple here, I'm just gonna add,\nsay this is a host 10.11.11.11.\n\n452\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.140\nOkay so this is a way to do it.\n\n453\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.060\nThis is the new way I would highly suggest\ndoing object math, we create an object,\n\n454\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.520\neven though it's for\na specific host, it's two lines.\n\n455\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.240\nWhen we create this,\nit's easy to use and easy to work.\n\n456\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.430\nAll right, so\nnow I've created this object.\n\n457\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:18.420\nAnd now I can create another one,\nwhich I wanna do,\n\n458\n00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:24.284\nobject network 10.11.12.11_obj.\n\n459\n00:23:24.284 --> 00:23:27.150\nAll right, so again,\nI didn't spell network right.\n\n460\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.810\nAgain I'd be using the obj.\n\n461\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.730\nNow you don't have to and,\nbut there is a reason for\n\n462\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.620\nthis because if I go ahead and\nput this IP address in here and\n\n463\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.490\nyou see it, you'd again, right off\nthe bat you don't see it's an object.\n\n464\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.670\nWell, so why am I really putting,\nwho cares,\n\n465\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.320\nyou might know you've creating this.\n\n466\n00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.770\nYou care because that's how they\nhave it on the exam objectives.\n\n467\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.440\nAll right, so there is a method\nto my madness here, my friends.\n\n468\n00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.880\nAll right, so host 10.11.12.11.\n\n469\n00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.240\nSo, again, we created two host objects.\n\n470\n00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.046\nSo I can use show run object and\nnow see my objects.\n\n471\n00:23:59.046 --> 00:24:00.796\nSo I've got a couple of objects here.\n\n472\n00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:05.320\nNotice again now, it's easy to see\nthat this right here is an object.\n\n473\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.440\nAnd that object references\nto these specific hosts.\n\n474\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.152\nRight?\n\n475\n00:24:09.152 --> 00:24:11.900\nAll right, now,\nwe need to create a now statement.\n\n476\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.130\nSo, I'm going to go out of this object.\n\n477\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.940\nAnd now I'm at global config,\nand I'm gonna create a nesting.\n\n478\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:25.280\nBut first off I want to allow DNS lookups\nto occur, right so, it's pretty important.\n\n479\n00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.360\nSo we want to allow inside hosts\nto get to outside using pat, and\n\n480\n00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.790\nallow DNS synchronous lookups.\n\n481\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.120\nSo that's really, this is kind of\nan important line that I use a lot.\n\n482\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.111\nSo inside outside, so\n\n483\n00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:43.260\nI'm going from the inside interface\nto the outside interface.\n\n484\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.928\nAnd my source is we're gonna use dynamic\nnet, I'm gonna use my tab key there,\n\n485\n00:24:47.928 --> 00:24:52.620\nany interface dns.\n\n486\n00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.370\nSo this is something that I would\nuse to allow DNS responses.\n\n487\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.650\nAnd that's what we wanna do.\n\n488\n00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.970\nSo we're gonna allow DNS queries,\nall right?\n\n489\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.956\nNow, I wanna do some basic static now.\n\n490\n00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:09.830\nThis is all I need to do for\nmy network here to allow this to work.\n\n491\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.840\nSo, I'm allowing DNS.\n\n492\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.100\nWe've created some objects, so\nlet's go ahead and use those objects now.\n\n493\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:21.590\nAll right, so I'm gonna say net inside,\noutside, now,\n\n494\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.470\nI'm going to put this as line one, I don't\nhave to, but I'm putting this as line one.\n\n495\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.990\nSource is static, and 10, 11, 11, 11.\n\n496\n00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.450\nRemember, I could leave this, if I'd\nname my object that, but I didn't, and\n\n497\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.930\nI named it OBJ.\n\n498\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:45.291\nAnd then go and\ntranslate to 10.11.12.11_obj.\n\n499\n00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:46.190\nOkay?\n\n500\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.731\n>> Stray parentheses in there.\n\n501\n00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:50.950\n>> I sure did.\n\n502\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.300\nNot typing well this morning.\n\n503\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.143\nSo Monday,\ngive me one second I'm getting there.\n\n504\n00:25:56.143 --> 00:25:57.408\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'd rather do this\n\n505\n00:25:57.408 --> 00:25:59.310\nthan typing out the whole line.\n\n506\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.420\n>> This is one of those rare occasions\nwhere the little typo indicator\n\n507\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.390\nwas accurate.\n\n508\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.879\nNormally it's just floating\nout there [CROSSTALK]\n\n509\n00:26:04.879 --> 00:26:06.483\n>> It kinda did.\n\n510\n00:26:06.483 --> 00:26:08.658\nYeah, sometimes it is and\nsometimes it's not.\n\n511\n00:26:08.658 --> 00:26:12.883\nSo in this case here, now that I've got\nthat done I'll leave this all nice and\n\n512\n00:26:12.883 --> 00:26:14.064\nbig and do an attack.\n\n513\n00:26:14.064 --> 00:26:16.766\nAnd see if that might work cuz\nbasically what I said is hey,\n\n514\n00:26:16.766 --> 00:26:21.420\nif you're sending a 10.11.12.11,\nthen there's my attack right there, right?\n\n515\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.440\nSo we should see it, well.\n\n516\n00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.295\n[LAUGH] The one time I\ndon't have logging on.\n\n517\n00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:32.280\n[LAUGH] So the one time I need logging on.\n\n518\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.020\nSee if this works here.\n\n519\n00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.280\nAll right, so I'm actually\ntranslating from the outside in and\n\n520\n00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.140\nwe should see this.\n\n521\n00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.870\nDid I log in con seven.\n\n522\n00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:45.580\nWe should see this be coming through.\n\n523\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.570\n>> Yeah, at this point we've\ngot the nat statement is place.\n\n524\n00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.885\nThe routes are in place.\n\n525\n00:26:49.885 --> 00:26:51.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The firewall that you created,\n\n526\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.790\nthe access list that you created that\nallowed all traffic, because all of this.\n\n527\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.490\n>> There we go.\n>> You know, Todd,\n\n528\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.170\nis allowing an attack to pass through.\n\n529\n00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.130\nAll of this would have been blocked.\n\n530\n00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.630\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n531\n00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.040\n>> You kind of intentionally weakened\n\n532\n00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.190\nthe security at this point.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. So what I did is I said\n\n533\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.450\nthat, you know, when this Kali Linux hits\nthis certain object, 10, 11, 12, whatever\n\n534\n00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:13.900\nit was, that outside object I created And\nI translated that to the inside, right?\n\n535\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.070\nSo, basically I know I'm going from\nthe inside out but allowed it to come in.\n\n536\n00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.920\nAnd by using those two objects,\nI was allowing them to make a connection.\n\n537\n00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.250\nBy default this would be broken.\n\n538\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:28.450\nBut we can see our connection table here\nand that attack definitely went through.\n\n539\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.490\nSo, local-host, right?\n\n540\n00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.290\nAll.\n\n541\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.580\nAll right, so we should be able to see\nthat it comes up and goes down and\n\n542\n00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.690\nit's gonna tear it out.\n\n543\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:38.860\nBut that's kinda cool.\n\n544\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.320\nSo what did we do in this?\n\n545\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.190\nWe created routing,\nsome basic routing, basic access.\n\n546\n00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.160\nRemember, there's no difference\nbetween static and, I'm sorry,\n\n547\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.540\nactually standard or extended, and\nwe created some static routes.\n\n548\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.610\nBut let's take a look at some now\nstatements for a second here.\n\n549\n00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.900\nSo show run net.\n\n550\n00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.700\nRight, so we can see our,\nno log con, right?\n\n551\n00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.730\nShow log con, so we run that, so\n\n552\n00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:14.480\nwe can see it and here's basically our\nlist with our using our objects again.\n\n553\n00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.540\nThe underscore object,\nwe'll see this in our exam objectives,\n\n554\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.090\nbut I used them in here so\nwe can see that these are objects too so\n\n555\n00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.630\nit is kind of helpful because we\nare doing that show run object.\n\n556\n00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.580\nLets see that, I think we already\nran this one, but we'll do it again.\n\n557\n00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.260\nSo here's my object network, INSIDE\nNETWORK, and the objects that I created.\n\n558\n00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.170\nHere's a subnet on this one here,\nand then also show nat.\n\n559\n00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.740\nThis is kind of important for\nyour exam objectives.\n\n560\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.930\nNow, we're seeing the Manual NAT\nbecause I didn't set up a Dynamic NAT,\n\n561\n00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.900\nI just really didn't.\n\n562\n00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.720\nSo we just used Static NAT, but if I did,\nIt would actually be in between these guys\n\n563\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.720\nand then the manual, what you want to\nunderstand for the exam objectives is\n\n564\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.810\nthe manual NAT statements\nare actually in the beginning, right?\n\n565\n00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.600\nAnd at the end and my dynamic NAT or auto\n\n566\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.100\nNAT is kind of in the middle depending\non what it feels like it should do.\n\n567\n00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.200\nIn this case here,\n>> My most specific would be at the top.\n\n568\n00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.934\nAll right, so with auto NAT is cool,\nextremely helpful for\n\n569\n00:29:13.934 --> 00:29:17.230\nour pulsing NAT, or\nwhat we call twice NAT now.\n\n570\n00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.420\nSo very, very helpful.\n\n571\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.550\nI love the new syntaxes and how NAT is so\n\n572\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.240\nmuch more helpful in the new\noperating system, so\n\n573\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.290\nwe´re saying something actually good about\nnot the SA, and the offense is swarming.\n\n574\n00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.610\n>> All right, well at this stage,\nI know we've configured our routes.\n\n575\n00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.970\nWe've configured our firewall rule.\n\n576\n00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.690\nWe got a chance to see that.\n\n577\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.350\nWe saw NAT, we saw our policy maps.\n\n578\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.270\nThat's pretty much all of the things that\nwe need for an initial configuration.\n\n579\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.010\nAnd, obviously, the show's not over.\n\n580\n00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.950\nWe got a lot more stuff coming down the\nline, as we move into other technologies.\n\n581\n00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.290\nBut, Todd do you have anything else we\nneed to cover for initial configuration?\n\n582\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:50.945\n>> No.\nNot for that.\n\n583\n00:29:50.945 --> 00:29:51.990\nJust remember this is very simple.\n\n584\n00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.540\nWe poke some holes in there.\n\n585\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.840\nPlease don't go out and\n\n586\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.085\ntype in permit IP any any on your\nASA in your production network.\n\n587\n00:29:58.085 --> 00:30:02.100\n[LAUGH] You might look a little\nfurther into something like that.\n\n588\n00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.140\nDon't try this at home type of thing.\n\n589\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.260\nBut again, we're just getting some basic\nstuff to get us some connectivity,\n\n590\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.140\nbut what we're gonna do now is we're\ngonna go into the next episode,\n\n591\n00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.080\nand we're gonna look at the GUI\nthat allows us to configure this\n\n592\n00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.280\nthrough what's called the ASDM.\n\n593\n00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.940\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat's gonna wrap this episode up.\n\n594\n00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.500\nI do thank you guys for watching.\n\n595\n00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.290\nAnd remember, stay tuned because we've got\nmore Cisco ASA Express Security coming up.\n\n596\n00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.530\nThat's quite the mouthful.\n\n597\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.580\nBut for now signing off for\nITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n598\n00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.140\n>> And Todd Lammle, thank you.\n\n599\n00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.160\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n600\n00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.141\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.755\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:18.903\nI'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:24.005\nDon Pezet back again with another\nepisode of Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.547\nI'll get to saying that smooth sooner or\nlater, probably by the end of the series.\n\n7\n00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:27.880\n>> That's a mouthful.\n\n8\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.220\n>> But we are back with ASA shows and\n\n9\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.463\nwe're gonna be diving right\nback into security now.\n\n10\n00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:34.880\nIn the first handful of episodes,\nif you guys have been watching them.\n\n11\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.941\nWe've hit you up with a command line for\npretty much everything and\n\n12\n00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.031\non initial configuration that works great.\n\n13\n00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:44.130\nAnd for gentlemen, like Todd over here\nwho are just command line native.\n\n14\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.127\nThat's the way to go, but there is a time\nand a place for a nice graphical user\n\n15\n00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:52.692\ninterface, especially when you're trying\nto walk an end user through something over\n\n16\n00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:55.588\nthe phone, it does come in handy and\nASAs do have that.\n\n17\n00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.311\nSo we're gonna spend a little\nbit of time this episode and\n\n18\n00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.942\ntake a look at the ASDM the graphical\ninterface and kinda see what it can do for\n\n19\n00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.780\nus and how that works and here to help in\nthe studio as always, Mr. Todd Lammle.\n\n20\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.337\nSo Todd,\nwhere do we wanna go with this one?\n\n21\n00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:10.630\n>> Yeah, so we have been using the CLI.\n\n22\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.922\nWe've done very basic configuration guys,\nas you're aware.\n\n23\n00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:19.300\nAnd there's a lot more detail in the ASA,\nbut we've gotten it up and working.\n\n24\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.541\nWe've been able to do, have the outside\nhost use the application to get in and\n\n25\n00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.796\neven send some attacks through there and\nlogging, some really great stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:33.129\nIt's a lot of fun, but there is some\nstuff that we want to use ASDM for.\n\n27\n00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:37.880\nFor example, when we get to VPNs in\nthe next episode, I find that a little bit\n\n28\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.422\neasier, because there's a lot of\ncommands in the CLI and that's fine.\n\n29\n00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:44.680\nI find that it doesn't always\nwork the first time I do it.\n\n30\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.879\nBut when I use the ASDM,\ntypically always works with the VPN.\n\n31\n00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.909\nSo I always use the CLI for pretty much\neverything on the ASAs no matter how many\n\n32\n00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.311\nI'm pushing out, except when I get to the\nVPNs, I've just kinda given up and said,\n\n33\n00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.350\nokay, I've done this for so\nmany years I can type this in.\n\n34\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.462\nBut there's always just something you\nmiss, cuz as we'll see the config that\n\n35\n00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:05.587\nthe ASDM's gonna create, it's pretty\nconvoluted for what we're gonna do.\n\n36\n00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:08.588\nCuz we're gonna do some different types\nof VPN, so that's the next episode.\n\n37\n00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:13.462\nSo stick around, but what I wanna show\nyou right now is let's get into the ASDM.\n\n38\n00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:17.088\nFirst, we have to go to our ASA and\nconfigure the access for the ASDM.\n\n39\n00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:20.337\nSo let's take a look.\n\n40\n00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:26.129\nSo we're here and\nI have to tell it that we wanna do HTTP.\n\n41\n00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.630\nSo we wanna enable that, so that first\nthing you do even though it's HTTP,\n\n42\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.588\nremember nothing is enabled by default.\n\n43\n00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:34.214\nNot Telnet, not SSH, not HTTP.\n\n44\n00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:37.754\nSo this is actually allowing HTTPS.\n\n45\n00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:40.860\nSo, server enable.\n\n46\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.879\nNope, I've got to spell it right.\n\n47\n00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.768\nWe're not done now, because,\nyeah, we're allowing that, but\n\n48\n00:02:46.768 --> 00:02:48.170\nwe have to tell it what network.\n\n49\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.296\nSo we can pick a host, but I think you\nwant to be slightly broader than that.\n\n50\n00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:57.950\nNow you can do something like,\nso we're gonna do HTTP and\n\n51\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.410\nwe can do something like zero, zero.\n\n52\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.297\nSo you could do this and\nsay, on my insight.\n\n53\n00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:07.640\nThis would absolutely work and\nthis does any network, any mass.\n\n54\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.791\nThat's okay it's only on your insight\nnetwork, so this might be, but so just\n\n55\n00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.254\nkeep that in mind that you're like, well,\nI don't know where I'm gonna come from.\n\n56\n00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:16.326\nIf you're too tight,\nthen you're not gonna get in and\n\n57\n00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:18.046\nyou're gonna forget how you configured it.\n\n58\n00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:19.711\nAnd you're like, why can't I get in?\n\n59\n00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:25.964\nSo I'm not quite as broad as that, so\nI'm gonna pick my management network and\n\n60\n00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:31.870\nput the mask in and say, the management\nnetwork can come from the inside.\n\n61\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.047\nRemember, we set our route, so we're able\nto do this or we wouldn't be able to.\n\n62\n00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:41.087\nSo now that I've got that going, the other\nthing is that you wanna set a user name.\n\n63\n00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:44.628\nNow the username is gonna be used when you\nlog in, so it's a pretty simple command.\n\n64\n00:03:44.628 --> 00:03:49.497\nWe use this for a few things, if you\nguys remember, local login database or\n\n65\n00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:54.462\nconsul auxiliary or something and\nthen ppp, something, local database.\n\n66\n00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:59.670\nSo I'm gonna say username_admin password.\n\n67\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.706\nPassword now the key is what,\nfrom the most part when I see this is\n\n68\n00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:10.046\na level 15 password, which means\nit gives me all of the benefits.\n\n69\n00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:12.879\nSometimes when I get them, they say,\nsometimes, I'll just get this command.\n\n70\n00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.326\nAnd says, I go to the SA and click on it\nsays, must be level 15 and I'm like well,\n\n71\n00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:18.879\nI thought it was level 15.\n\n72\n00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.503\nSo I don't take any chances, so\nI just type in privilege 15.\n\n73\n00:04:23.503 --> 00:04:27.372\nEven though it's set to 15 by default, I\nsee that that works most of the time, but\n\n74\n00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:28.710\nnot all of the time.\n\n75\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.878\nThe other thing I could type in here and\n\n76\n00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:36.546\nI would do this ASDM image and\nI wanna say, on what disk.\n\n77\n00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:38.390\n[LAUGH] I am really not typing well today.\n\n78\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.461\nI would go to disk0 and\ntype out the image.\n\n79\n00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:46.104\nSo basically, if I came back here and\nsaid show disk0 and\n\n80\n00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:49.795\nthen we can see our ASDM,\nit's right there.\n\n81\n00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:53.212\nNow remember, so we're running 941 and\nour asdm is 741.\n\n82\n00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:57.859\nThese do not line up one for one and so\nthere's gonna be some new images coming\n\n83\n00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.629\nout, so\nyou might be running a new one by now.\n\n84\n00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:01.350\nSo why would I type this in?\n\n85\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.296\nSo if I type that in,\nthen how do you get ASDM on your desktop?\n\n86\n00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:10.587\nSo, it's not as easy to\nfind as you might think.\n\n87\n00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:13.047\nYou probably can, but\nwhy not get it from the ASA itself?\n\n88\n00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:16.818\nSo I'll go out there and\nput the image in, HTTPS and\n\n89\n00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:21.838\nthen bring up a browser and\nit'll ask me to go ahead and download it.\n\n90\n00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:22.640\nVery simple.\n\n91\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.879\nWe don't have to do that now,\ncuz I already downloaded it to my desktop.\n\n92\n00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.671\nSo let's go to the ASDM,\nwhich it runs Java.\n\n93\n00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:34.337\nI mean, what do you think about?\n\n94\n00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:37.046\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kind of pretty funny, right?\n\n95\n00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:39.297\n>> You can tell just by the inflection\nof your voice there, Todd.\n\n96\n00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.711\nThis runs Java.\n\n97\n00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:42.182\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n98\n00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:44.800\nthe fact is what version are you running.\n\n99\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.171\nSo here's the hard part\nabout Cisco on this.\n\n100\n00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:52.412\nI guess on any manufacturer I\nwon't pick on Cisco too much, but\n\n101\n00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:55.958\nthe fact is when you have Java running for\nthis and then you use Java for\n\n102\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.690\nanother program that they have,\nthen maybe they're not compatible and\n\n103\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.504\nthat's the annoying feature and\nI suppose the manufacturers like that.\n\n104\n00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:08.370\nSo finding the right version of Java,\njust for all my hopes here.\n\n105\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.837\nIt takes some effort, so\nthat might be your biggest problem here.\n\n106\n00:06:12.837 --> 00:06:15.862\nThe other thing is if you're ever\nwatching a marketing video for Cisco,\n\n107\n00:06:15.862 --> 00:06:16.962\nit's just kind of funny.\n\n108\n00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:19.966\nAnd Ada, let's go to the ASDM or\nthe CSM or whatever it is and\n\n109\n00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.421\nit opens instantaneously.\n\n110\n00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:25.130\nI'm like, what planet are these guys on,\n[LAUGH] cuz this never does for me.\n\n111\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.822\nSo let's take a look at this and so I'm\ngonna get in through my management network\n\n112\n00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:34.379\nthrough the inside and admin password and\nit's gonna give me privilege 15.\n\n113\n00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.930\nAgain, I know everyone's gonna write\nme and say, mine always runs 15.\n\n114\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.546\nAgain, I get some errors when\nI don't type that command in.\n\n115\n00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:43.837\nSo this is kind of loading\nrelatively fast today.\n\n116\n00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.190\n>> [INAUDIBLE] advantage of\na lab environment, I guess.\n\n117\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.462\n>> Not quite as fast as on\na Cisco marketing screen.\n\n118\n00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:52.975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we can see something here and\n\n119\n00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:54.754\nsome really great stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:54.754 --> 00:06:56.129\nThis is a pretty cool tool.\n\n121\n00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.420\nThis is one of their, here's their\nannoying features, their Call Home's.\n\n122\n00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.880\nIf you want to register and tell us, you\nwant to send it as anonymous, the issues.\n\n123\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.504\nSo I'm gonna say,\ndo not call unable smart call home.\n\n124\n00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:09.581\n>> And if you have a smart net agreement,\nif your device is under warranty,\n\n125\n00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:11.254\nyou can turn on that call home feature.\n\n126\n00:07:11.254 --> 00:07:13.596\nAnd in theory,\nif a problem happens on your device,\n\n127\n00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:15.420\nit'll report back to Cisco right away.\n\n128\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.401\nThey can open a ticket and actually\nbe working the ticket before you even\n\n129\n00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:20.546\nknow about the issue is\nhow it's supposed to work.\n\n130\n00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:21.296\n>> Sure, they will.\n\n131\n00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:23.129\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I believe you.\n\n132\n00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, guys.\n\n133\n00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:29.770\nSo the first thing, remember that\nlogging we used from the CLI?\n\n134\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.796\nWell, there's a couple different ways to\nget there and one of them is is down here.\n\n135\n00:07:32.796 --> 00:07:34.254\nIt says, Enable Logging.\n\n136\n00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:39.184\nSo if I take a look down here now and once\nyou turn this on, it's typically on and\n\n137\n00:07:39.184 --> 00:07:40.548\nit's logging ASDM.\n\n138\n00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:43.671\nSo it's doing information,\nwhich is I think level six, I believe.\n\n139\n00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:49.087\nSo anyways, syslog level, don't quote me\non that, but I'm pretty sure it's six.\n\n140\n00:07:49.087 --> 00:07:52.754\nBut nonetheless, we're gonna go head and\nsee our log down here.\n\n141\n00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:54.087\nThis is a way to do it.\n\n142\n00:07:54.087 --> 00:07:56.712\nThere's obviously, another way and\nthis keeps it off your CLI.\n\n143\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:07:58.087\nBut yet, you can still see things.\n\n144\n00:07:58.087 --> 00:07:59.504\nSo that's kind of cool.\n\n145\n00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:02.421\nSo we'll keep an eye on this, but\nwe'll actually go back to our CLI.\n\n146\n00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:04.015\nWhen we push out some configs and\n\n147\n00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:06.505\nwatch the configs being\npushed out from the ASTM.\n\n148\n00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:08.610\nSo I know it's kinda hard to see.\n\n149\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.140\nThere's a couple of different things.\n\n150\n00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.160\nSo, we're at home now and\n\n151\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.480\nthis is basically telling\nus here's our interfaces.\n\n152\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.050\nI don't, my DMZ I never finished\nconfiguring so, no IP address,\n\n153\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.900\nthey're down.\n\n154\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.040\nHere's my inside and\noutside and those are working.\n\n155\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.940\nAnd my connections ASTM version and\nof course our licensing.\n\n156\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.380\nWe talk about the different licensing that\nyou have on your ASTM for this guy here.\n\n157\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.140\nNow I can connect up to multiple different\n\n158\n00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.050\nASAs here actually in here\nunder the configuration.\n\n159\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.630\nI can have multiple ASAs listed here and\nthen go look at one,\n\n160\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.200\nif you have a lot though,\nprobably not using ASTM we're using CSM.\n\n161\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.400\nAnd again we're probably replacing\nthe ASTM this year with something else.\n\n162\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.310\nI won't talk about that right now.\n\n163\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.880\nBut we want to take a look\nat some different stuff.\n\n164\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:07.260\nOne of the first things I want you to do\nwhen you go into ASTM is go to tools.\n\n165\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.660\nPreferences, tools, preferences.\n\n166\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.850\nAll right, and one of the things\nthat we want to do is, and\n\n167\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.070\nit's already checked on mine.\n\n168\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.690\nOnce you check it and it stays there.\n\n169\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.920\nIt's not on by default.\n\n170\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.490\nBut this says preview commands\nbefore sending them to the device.\n\n171\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.310\nSo, basically any time I wanna say okay,\nI'm gonna configure this path or whatever,\n\n172\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.380\nhere's the configs.\n\n173\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.680\nAnd we're gonna those out to the device.\n\n174\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.890\nIt's gonna show me the configuration,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.490\nOkay, and then enable logging.\n\n176\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.880\nWhich level,\nwe can do some packet captures and so on.\n\n177\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.510\nBut, really I just want you\nto go in here and click this.\n\n178\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.340\nThat way you get in idea of what\nyou're pushing out, get an idea here.\n\n179\n00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.490\nOkay, so let's go to the Setup Wizard.\n\n180\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.680\nSo, under device setup, so\n\n181\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.970\nif I come here to launch start up wizard.\n\n182\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.880\nOkay, so this is kind of like\nremember when we did a write\n\n183\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.860\nerase on that earlier episode and\nwent to the set up mode?\n\n184\n00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.410\nAnd so, we can go through this again.\n\n185\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.360\nAnd so basically, really guys,\nall you have to do to get this working\n\n186\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.290\nis those HTTP commands with the ASTM\nplugged in to the management support and\n\n187\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.780\nnow you're in here and\nyou can set up, set up your ASA.\n\n188\n00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.765\nThis is the way to do it.\n\n189\n00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:18.415\n>> Yeah, and you do need to be a little\ncareful with this wizard because it give\n\n190\n00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:19.986\nyou the option to change\nyour IP addresses.\n\n191\n00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:20.609\n>> Yes, it does.\n>> and so\n\n192\n00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:24.126\nif you're connected via your laptop\non one IP and then the IPs change,\n\n193\n00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:26.160\nyou effectively disconnect yourself.\n\n194\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.790\nSo, I still prefer to do the command\nline version like you did, Todd.\n\n195\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.630\nConnect to the console cable and you're\nalways safe but this certainly works.\n\n196\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.440\n>> So check this out.\n\n197\n00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.080\nIt does notice that I have\na configuration in here and it says,\n\n198\n00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.810\nhey do you wanna modify?\n\n199\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.920\nSo you guys can see that.\n\n200\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.840\nOr we can reset it to factory default.\n\n201\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.800\nYou will lose your connection if you\ndo that and then you have to go in and\n\n202\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.020\nset it up so you can get back in here.\n\n203\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.460\nBut notice I don't have an IP\naddress in the management interface.\n\n204\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.580\nI'm not doing it that way.\n\n205\n00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.710\nI'm coming in through my inside,\nright, my inside ports.\n\n206\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.410\nSo we're gonna leave this.\n\n207\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.020\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a quick look at this.\n\n208\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.650\nChange my host name, put enable secret on\nhere, enable password, privilege password.\n\n209\n00:11:06.925 --> 00:11:07.440\nOkay.\n\n210\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.960\nAnd now it's gonna look for\nthe interfaces,\n\n211\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.620\nand again, since we had done so\nmuch show me hey here's your outside,\n\n212\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.320\nwe can disable the security level,\ncan change the security level here.\n\n213\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.720\nAnd the IP address, I can make it\nuse DHCP or PPP over ethernet.\n\n214\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.810\nAnd the subnet mask,\nyou don't even have to type things out.\n\n215\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.650\nSo, I can come here and\nsay well I don't understand IPv6,\n\n216\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.580\nI don't wanna do that from command line.\n\n217\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.840\nLet's do that from the ASTM, right?\n\n218\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.060\nSo again we still have\nto type that in but,\n\n219\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.380\nnonetheless this allows me to configure.\n\n220\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.999\nThat's my outside interface there.\n\n221\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.910\nAnd now it shows me my\ndifferent interfaces so\n\n222\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.470\nI can click on the inside here and\nthen click edit and\n\n223\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:48.410\nthat will allow me now to configure my\ninside interface or reconfigure it.\n\n224\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.200\nNow, check this out.\n\n225\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.980\nWhat's this say at the bottom here?\n\n226\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.500\nWe talked about this just a minute ago.\n\n227\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.120\nEnable traffic between two or more\ninterfaces with the same security levels,\n\n228\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.340\nright, so\nwe did this from the command line and\n\n229\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.590\nnow we notice we can do this from my VPNs.\n\n230\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.490\nAnd this for\nthe same security levels, right?\n\n231\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.680\nThese are very important commands,\nwe use these a lot.\n\n232\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.250\nSo in this case here people are like well,\nI can't remember the commands.\n\n233\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.330\nIt was same interface enter of traffic.\n\n234\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.860\nSo easy to remember\nwhen you're on the CLI.\n\n235\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.230\nSpecify static route, so\nI have some static routes here.\n\n236\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.000\nAnd again, we're going through setup mode.\n\n237\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.600\nI never configure it like this, but you\ncan and I can add another route in here.\n\n238\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.170\nSo I say add and it's gonna say what\nis the network you wanna add inside and\n\n239\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.780\noutside interface, the gateway IP address.\n\n240\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.740\nThis is a way to do it.\n\n241\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.780\nI'm not saying that we're\ngonna do it like this, so\n\n242\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.940\nI'm just gonna cancel\nout of this obviously.\n\n243\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.508\nJust wanted to take a quick look at that.\n\n244\n00:12:45.508 --> 00:12:47.830\nOkay?\n\n245\n00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.650\nNow, we want to go into our interface and\nso I,\n\n246\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.980\nat this point here,\nI want to configure this.\n\n247\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.390\nSo we're gonna go to configuration and\nI'm gonna click and\n\n248\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.210\nsee my different configurations\nhere of what I can change.\n\n249\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.240\nNow so\nnotice the system time can configure NTP.\n\n250\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.630\nThat might be important to you,\nit is important to me.\n\n251\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.160\nHere's my routing and here's my interface,\nso I can come in here and\n\n252\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.310\nI'm manually doing this now right?\n\n253\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.500\nSo I'm manually doing this,\nI can click on my interfaces,\n\n254\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.740\nI'm not going through that setup.\n\n255\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.710\nBut I'm kind of on the same screen right,\nand\n\n256\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.380\nI can add or edit what I wanna do here.\n\n257\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.935\nAnd so I can do, so click on my\ninterfaces and configure those.\n\n258\n00:13:26.935 --> 00:13:30.520\n[COUGH] And let's go into routing.\n\n259\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.330\nSo notice when you click on the main\nscreen, it gives you kind of an overview,\n\n260\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.300\nand we can see what we can do.\n\n261\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.830\nHere's my multicast,\nprobably take a look at that.\n\n262\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:43.039\nStatic routes, route maps, IPv4, 6,\nour different routing protocols for\n\n263\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.860\nIPv4 and IPv6 here, different rip.\n\n264\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.230\nSo let's take a look at,\nI don't know, OSPFs.\n\n265\n00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.980\nThat sounds good?\n\n266\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.370\nYou like that idea?\n\n267\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.102\n>> Pretty common protocol.\n\n268\n00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:53.596\n>> Pretty common.\n\n269\n00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:56.052\nNow, I'm gonna show you this.\n\n270\n00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:58.570\nTo me it's a lot easier to\ndo this from the CLI but\n\n271\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.530\nmaybe it's because I've been doing it for\nmore than 20 years or something.\n\n272\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.570\nAnyway, I'm going to click on OSPF and\nI click on set up.\n\n273\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.300\nGuess I have to come back over here and\ndo it from here.\n\n274\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.650\nNow, so I'm gonna enable Process 1.\n\n275\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.500\nNotice it allows me to do two\ndifferent processes on here.\n\n276\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.188\nTypically, we don't do more\nthan one process with OSPF,\n\n277\n00:14:17.188 --> 00:14:20.530\nbecause then you're creating\nan autonomous system border router.\n\n278\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.850\nWhich we certainly don't want\nto be that with our ASA so\n\n279\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.400\nI'm just gonna do Process 1 and\na process ID.\n\n280\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.450\nWe can use, what's the numbers Don?\n\n281\n00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.115\nGo back 20 years on your configs.\n\n282\n00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:33.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well the process ID in all the books\n\n283\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.000\nthey usually use 1 or 100.\n\n284\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.860\nBut it's a,\nis that one a 32-bit number or is it a?\n\n285\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.010\n>> Yeah no it's\n>> It's one to 65,535.\n\n286\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:44.600\nIt's any number, not starting at zero,\nstarting at one,\n\n287\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.870\nprocess ID, now is that number important?\n\n288\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.260\nYou know, it's funny, when I'm doing my MP\nclasses and stuff I'm always talking about\n\n289\n00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.300\nit's the most unimportant but\nimportant number that you know.\n\n290\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.280\nBecause, what difference does\nit make what your process ID is?\n\n291\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.900\nIt doesn't,\n\n292\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.160\nit's only important that when you come\nback in to your CLI you know what it is.\n\n293\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.750\nOther than that.\n\n294\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.020\nSo we have that.\n\n295\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.000\nSo we have the process ID.\n\n296\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.210\nDoesn't matter what the numbers is,\n\n297\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.870\nremember they don't have to\nbe the same in all routers.\n\n298\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.520\nThis is an OSPF class.\n\n299\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.080\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd a network in here.\n\n300\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.300\nOkay, so it's normal.\n\n301\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.068\nWe're not gonna talk, not so\nstubby areas and stubs,\n\n302\n00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.230\nwe're not gonna talk about those.\n\n303\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.240\nBut we're gonna say what area ID,\nin this case, zero.\n\n304\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.780\nSo you know, again,\n\n305\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.810\nif I was on the CLI it would kind\nof be done to be honest with you.\n\n306\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.710\nSo in this case here my IP address,\nI'm gonna do, how about this,\n\n307\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.390\nyou know my network ten right and\nthen we don't even use the inverse mass,\n\n308\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.820\nthey will in the config.\n\n309\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.680\nSo I'm gonna say okay,\nnetwork ten with this mask which is\n\n310\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.940\nanything that starts\nwith ten is what I said.\n\n311\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.090\nSo pretty simple, I guess.\n\n312\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.060\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nwe can add a course.\n\n313\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.610\nThe hash.\n\n314\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.120\nRight?\nThe password, so.\n\n315\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.480\nAnd then put that in if we wanted\na password or an MD5 hash.\n\n316\n00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:53.983\nAll right.\nSo\n\n317\n00:15:53.983 --> 00:15:57.879\nwe've got that in there and\nwe can also do route summarization.\n\n318\n00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:01.467\nAnd let's take a look at multi-cast for\na minute, and\n\n319\n00:16:01.467 --> 00:16:06.800\nHere's my bidirectional neighbors,\nright, my bidirectional PIM.\n\n320\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.700\nRight, so we've got PIM, and so, remember,\n\n321\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.750\nthat's something that we remember and\nconfigure.\n\n322\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.280\nThis is extremely easy to\nconfigure by the command line,\n\n323\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.940\nmuch easier than even those\npath if you can imagine.\n\n324\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.840\nAll right, so if I come back here and\nlook at this,\n\n325\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.630\nI've got more out of my configuration.\n\n326\n00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.680\nNow it's going to say,\nokay you made some changes,\n\n327\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.420\ndo you want to apply these changes?\n\n328\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.034\nI'm going to say yes and remember we set\nthat parameter so it's going to come up\n\n329\n00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:35.470\nand it's going to configure this for me\nand then show me before I'm configuring.\n\n330\n00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.820\nBut, the other thing I want to do is\nwhere is my ASA, where did you go?\n\n331\n00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:52.693\nI'm here.\n\n332\n00:16:52.693 --> 00:16:57.538\nOkay so we're going to do logging\ncon seven logging on, right, and\n\n333\n00:16:57.538 --> 00:17:00.100\nso we'll be able to see this occur.\n\n334\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.940\nSo let's go back to my ASTM,\nI forgot I was using the same thing.\n\n335\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.570\nSo I'm gonna say refresh now, and\nit's going to basically show me\n\n336\n00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.680\nthe configuration that's being\ndownloaded for the ASTM.\n\n337\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.180\nAll right, so this is what it's doing,\nit didn't actually,\n\n338\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.450\nI thought it was supposed to show me,\nbut nonetheless we can see this\n\n339\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.669\nis a lot of configuration, we barely\nmade some changes whatsoever, didn't we.\n\n340\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.090\nAnd the other thing is that you're\nhaving to do a lot of it by hand.\n\n341\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.720\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know,\n\n342\n00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.690\nwith ASTM,\nlet's say with a set of 100 ASA's.\n\n343\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.100\n>> Yeah.\n>> You don't want to use the ASTM for\n\n344\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.970\nthat when you could just write\nout a text based config and\n\n345\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.670\npaste it in on each one and\nhave it knocked out in short order.\n\n346\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.040\nSo it's got its positives,\nit's got its negatives.\n\n347\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.600\nIt's definitely easier\nif you don't know what\n\n348\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.790\nyou're doing because you\ncan stumble through it.\n\n349\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.600\n>> Yeah, you really could.\n\n350\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.540\nSo let's take a look at\na couple of things here.\n\n351\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.220\nSo I want to go through,\ngo back to configuration here and\n\n352\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.640\nthen go over here but check it out here.\n\n353\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.740\nBasically I'm at device setup,\nso we're going to click on\n\n354\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.500\nthe firewall tab and we're going to come,\nand then we can see our file.\n\n355\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.090\nThis is basically our access list, right?\n\n356\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.030\nSo we're going to click on add.\n\n357\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.550\nAnd this is really helpful for somebody\nwho hasn't done a lot of access lists.\n\n358\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.745\nAnd your boss says hey,\nwe're seeing a lot of people from sales\n\n359\n00:18:19.745 --> 00:18:22.595\ngetting the DMZ and\ndoing something we don't like, whatever.\n\n360\n00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:26.084\nAnd so, he says or she says go and\nstop sales from getting to the DMC,\n\n361\n00:18:26.084 --> 00:18:28.725\nand well just use that\nas a product sample.\n\n362\n00:18:28.725 --> 00:18:30.855\nAnd so you're like,\nwell I don't know how to do that.\n\n363\n00:18:30.855 --> 00:18:35.435\nSo if you come in the ASTM or\nclick on firewall and just say add and\n\n364\n00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:39.320\nwe're gonna say hey, the interface DMZ,\nnotice we have our different interfaces.\n\n365\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.060\nI'm gonna deny.\nNow I can click on users here, but\n\n366\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.480\nto be able to do something like this,\nand I think that we typically\n\n367\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.107\nwould in this environment,\nwe'd have to have an AD serve with LDAP.\n\n368\n00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:51.930\nAnd that would populate this information.\n\n369\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.160\nI would be able to click on it.\n\n370\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.420\nSo very just click sales and denying them,\n\n371\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.530\nand I'm gonna actually get rid of that and\nI'm gonna type in.\n\n372\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:08.690\nI'm gonna say they're 172 16.10.0,\nand so we're gonna put them in there.\n\n373\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:14.919\nAnd we're gonna deny sales to the DMZ,\nso I'm gonna click on the interface.\n\n374\n00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:21.020\nSay okay, I'm just showing you a really\neasy example on how to do this and\n\n375\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.970\nthen I'm gonna say the service, right?\n\n376\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.960\nAnd if I say IP, that's basically saying,\nyou know, kinda anything in the IP stack.\n\n377\n00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.160\nBut we can be a little bit more succinct\nhere and stop them from using ICMP or\n\n378\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.890\nstopping any TCP or UDP.\n\n379\n00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.794\nJust to kind of annoy them at that point,\nright?\n\n380\n00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:42.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just say can you use UDP so\n\n381\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.800\nthey get some stuff and\nwe'd just be annoying them.\n\n382\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.560\nThe other thing is, so\nI'm going to stop all sales to DMZ, right.\n\n383\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.360\nAll right, and\nthen we can do our login level,\n\n384\n00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.900\nwe're gonna do login and\nwe can go all the way to seven.\n\n385\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.740\nSo yeah, there's informational six so\ndebugging so\n\n386\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.110\nwe're doing level seven to\nlogging on here, so say okay.\n\n387\n00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.490\nAll right, I guess we don't need our,\nsays 24 on there.\n\n388\n00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.690\nAll right, so anyways, so we have that.\n\n389\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.790\nSo again,\nwe can come over here and do that.\n\n390\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.680\nUnder the device setup, again,\nI was showing you the time.\n\n391\n00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.680\nBut coming here, it's easy to add\nthe time, put in the IP address and so on.\n\n392\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.240\nSo again, under device management.\n\n393\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.420\nLet's go down to device management.\n\n394\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.688\nA couple more things here.\n\n395\n00:20:32.688 --> 00:20:37.120\nIt's asking me do I want to apply changes,\nso I'm going to say, yes, apply changes,\n\n396\n00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.470\nand there's my changes.\n\n397\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.461\nSo this is kind of what I did and\nthis is the access list.\n\n398\n00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:43.940\nNotice they did line one,\ntwo, three, four here.\n\n399\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:49.420\nAnd then they made it a,\nthey put in remarks here.\n\n400\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.970\nSo remarks are when you go through there\nand you just show run access list,\n\n401\n00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.790\nyou're able to actually\nsee what's going on.\n\n402\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.280\nSo very kind of cool here.\n\n403\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.810\nWe'll say send and let's go out of this\nand remember that my ASA is behind here.\n\n404\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.980\nSo I'm gonna see that this should\ncome back and ask me to upgrade.\n\n405\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.300\nDid I miss something here?\n\n406\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.445\nActually I click on this, sorry.\n\n407\n00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:18.450\n[COUGH] I should have seen that\ncome through, but I didn't.\n\n408\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.540\nSo either I missed it or\nit already went through.\n\n409\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.969\nBut none the less, one of the other things\nis make sure that we can do logging.\n\n410\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:33.930\nAnd under device management, so we can go\nahead and click on logging, there it is.\n\n411\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.080\nThis is the other thing we want, so\nwe can do some other logging from here,\n\n412\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.240\nI showed it from the first, and\nnow we can do some different logs in here.\n\n413\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:46.140\nAll right so basically there's, I kinda\njust scratched the surface on here,\n\n414\n00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.680\nthere's a lot of stuff we\ncan do with the firewalls.\n\n415\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.110\nI don't use it for a lot stuff.\n\n416\n00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.790\nSo I'm kinda [LAUGH] looking around there\ntrying to remember some this stuff.\n\n417\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.890\nCuz I don't use it for that.\n\n418\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.240\nI only use it for my VPN's.\n\n419\n00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.000\nBut we can see we use it for\nrouting protocols.\n\n420\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.530\nLet's say you didn't understand multicast\nand you had to do it by direction pin.\n\n421\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:02.970\nThat was pretty simple.\n\n422\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.290\nIt helped me do some access lists\nif I didn't understand those.\n\n423\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.850\nI can just go in there and do the setup\nand walk you through on the GUI.\n\n424\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.580\nBut we're gonna see in the next episode\nthat this is gonna be extremely\n\n425\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.260\nhelpful to us when we get in some\nmore complex configurations.\n\n426\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.770\n>> Yeah and you know, you mentioned VPN's.\n\n427\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.470\nJust a simple VPN is a good 14 or\n15 commands to get that put in place.\n\n428\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.100\nSo, being able to preview those commands\nwhere the apply is really handy because\n\n429\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.190\nwhat you might do is maybe you just got\nthe ASDM running in your lab environment.\n\n430\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.100\nAnd you run through the ASDM\nto do the VPN configs so\n\n431\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.490\nyou can generate all those commands and\nthen you can just edit those and\n\n432\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.810\npaste them into your actual\nproduction systems so.\n\n433\n00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.594\nYou may chose to not run the ASDM\nfrom your production systems at all,\n\n434\n00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:43.560\nit's really up to you.\n\n435\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.560\n>> Yeah\n>> But it´s pretty useful.\n\n436\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.910\n>> Okay good.\n>> All right, well Todd,\n\n437\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.640\nthat's a pretty good run down of the ASDM.\n\n438\n00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.370\nSome people love it,\nsome people use it all the time.\n\n439\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.420\nSome people never use it.\n\n440\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.150\nIt's really up to you, but\nit is a resource that's there, and\n\n441\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.200\nit's on the exam so\nyou'll want to be aware of it.\n\n442\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.420\nTodd, before we wrap up is there\nanything else you want to throw in?\n\n443\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.600\nNo, not really, I mean, it just takes\na little bit mileage and stuff.\n\n444\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.190\nAnd if you don't use it for a while,\nyou kind of forget where some stuff is at.\n\n445\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.200\nBut it's pretty easy.\n\n446\n00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.000\nIt's intuitive, right.\n\n447\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.860\nThe hardest part about ASDM is making\nsure you have the right java version.\n\n448\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.810\n>> Yeah, and on the Java version side,\none of the easiest ways to make\n\n449\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.680\nsure you've got the right version there,\nis if you've got a SmartNet agreement,\n\n450\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.990\nyou can log into Cisco's support website\nand you can pull the release notes for\n\n451\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.490\nthe version of the ASDM and it'll tell\nyou which version of Java is supported.\n\n452\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.620\nIt is a race against security though.\n\n453\n00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.840\nJava's constantly updating,\n\n454\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.260\nwhich means Cisco's gotta constantly\nupdate the ASDM to keep up.\n\n455\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.780\nIt's a bit of a challenge.\n\n456\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.500\nAll right, well, ladies and\n\n457\n00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.220\ngentlemen, that's a good spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n458\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.740\nWe're certainly not done with\nour ASA Express Security,\n\n459\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.290\nwe've got more episodes coming up as you\nmove into other topics like VPN's and\n\n460\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.040\nmore advanced technologies,\ndefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n461\n00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.820\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV.\n\n462\n00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.080\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n463\n00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:53.920\n>> And Tom Riley.\n\n464\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.453\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n465\n00:23:55.453 --> 00:24:02.140\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.649\nwelcome back to an episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.330\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.837\nBack again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:25.708\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe diving into the wide world of\n\n7\n00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:27.020\nVirtual Private Networks.\n\n8\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.880\nVPNs, you guys, you know them,\nyou love them, you've used them, right?\n\n9\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.210\nI think pretty much everybody\nuses VPNs these days.\n\n10\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.690\nWe're gonna get a chance to see how\nto implement those on the ASA and\n\n11\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.190\nsome of the different features\nthat are available inside of it.\n\n12\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.832\nAnd here to help me as always, we have Mr.\nTodd Lammle in the studio with me.\n\n13\n00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:41.538\nHow's it going, Todd?\n\n14\n00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:42.131\n>> Great.\n\n15\n00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:43.782\nAll right.\nSo, in this section here guys,\n\n16\n00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:46.980\nwe're not gonna get into IP sack, and\nall the differences between there,\n\n17\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.170\nbecause that's a whole course in itself.\n\n18\n00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.310\nWhat this course is about is, okay, let's\ntalk about some different types of VPN's,\n\n19\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.520\nI'll mention those, and how do we\nconfigure them using the ASCM and\n\n20\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.878\nthen verify them.\n\n21\n00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:01.200\nAnd I'm gonna use the two typical\nones that I see in production a lot.\n\n22\n00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.262\nSo, let's go ahead, and we're gonna\nstart with a couple PowerPoints and\n\n23\n00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.214\nthen we're gonna move\nright into the hands on.\n\n24\n00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:08.837\nAnd we're gonna use the ASTM and\nwe're gonna look at the configs and\n\n25\n00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:11.310\nsee all the stuff that\nwe'd have to go through.\n\n26\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340\nSo again, this course isn't\na deep dive into the VPNs,\n\n27\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850\nit's here's what you need to do for\nproduction, here's how you get it done,\n\n28\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.220\nand here's how you troubleshoot and\nverify it.\n\n29\n00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.430\nSo, let's go ahead a take a look.\n\n30\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.000\nOkay?\nSo\n\n31\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320\nvirtual private networks, first off,\nin this course it has Anyconnect,\n\n32\n00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.850\nso we're gonna talk about\nCisco's Anyconnect client.\n\n33\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.940\nVery cool client.\n\n34\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.340\nNow you can buy an enterprise addition and\nwe can see that.\n\n35\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.960\nIt actually gives us some security and\nmalware, and talks that.\n\n36\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.455\nSo now yet, we have a,\nnow this is a supplicant, right?\n\n37\n00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.590\nSo, we can talk about supplements earlier.\n\n38\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770\nBut, the fact is the supplicant\nmeans I'm gonna reside on here, and\n\n39\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.550\nattach to something else with some\nthird party software on here.\n\n40\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.690\nAnd basically it's gonna allow me to have\nsome EAP on my network or wireless or\n\n41\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.570\nconnect up BPM and also talk to the amp\ncloud, if you really wanted to do that.\n\n42\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.670\nSo, with Cisco has the firepower amp for\nclients and\n\n43\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.212\nso you wouldn't do both, right, so.\n\n44\n00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:08.840\nAll right, so but we gotta remember\nthat we're gonna use these for\n\n45\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.890\nexam objectives that we are looking at,\nCSA, ASA, ASA express, right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.600\nThe Anyconnect, there's a premium license.\n\n47\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.318\nWe get the premium license.\n\n48\n00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:21.970\nIf you're gonna configure and\nmanage the next generation firewall,\n\n49\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.290\nwe need the premium license editions here.\n\n50\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.450\nSo, here's my exam objectives\non the Anyconnect.\n\n51\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.310\nIt's an agent for\nposture to deliver consistent,\n\n52\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.030\nhighly secure endpoints across wired,\nwireless, or VPNs.\n\n53\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.000\nProvides optional web security and\nadvanced malware threat defense.\n\n54\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.290\nI'm not telling you to run out and\nbuy this and\n\n55\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.920\nthink you're gonna replace\nwhatever else that you have.\n\n56\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.340\nAgain, if you're getting\ninto the firepower module,\n\n57\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.210\nyou'll see that we use AMP for\nnetworks and AMP for clients.\n\n58\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.640\nSo, this is if you don't have that.\n\n59\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.910\nMonitors endpoint application usage, so\n\n60\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.090\nnow I can see who's kinda top talkers,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.650\nAnyways, there's something called DTLS,\nnow, not gonna get into this a lot.\n\n62\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.620\nWe are gonna choose this and\nI recommend that you choose it and\n\n63\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.000\nhere's why the second bullet point talks\nabout that it improves the bandwidth and\n\n64\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.090\nperformance of real-time applications\nacross an SSL connection, an SSL tunnel.\n\n65\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.670\nSo, it's really what we\nneed to know about it.\n\n66\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.280\nHere's some exam objectives here.\n\n67\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.804\nIt does this by using TLS to\nestablish DTLS connections and\n\n68\n00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:27.375\nDTLS to transmit datagrams and replaces\nthe underlying protocols with UDP 443.\n\n69\n00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:30.652\nSo, we're gonna see that we're\ngonna configure and just use DTLS,\n\n70\n00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:33.320\nnot worry about it,\nlet it do its job in the background.\n\n71\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.230\nSo, the first thing we're\ngonna take a look at is\n\n72\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.500\nsomething called a Clientless SSL VPN,\nand this is kinda,\n\n73\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.100\na lot of people use this because\nwe end up with a portal.\n\n74\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.050\nYou don't need any\nsupplicant on your laptop,\n\n75\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.920\nwe don't need the AnyConnect, okay?\n\n76\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.470\nSo, basically we end up at kind\nof webpage that has bookmarks and\n\n77\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.850\nwe have to configure those.\n\n78\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.760\nThey get very nitty gritty on\nthe details on the exam objectives for\n\n79\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.310\nthe Clientless SSL.\n\n80\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.800\nSo, we need to understand how\nto create this portal and\n\n81\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.080\nhow to create bookmarks and so on.\n\n82\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.170\nSo, we're gonna take a look here.\n\n83\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.610\nSo, let's go on and we'll do that now.\n\n84\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.767\nAnd then we'll see how far we get and how\nlong it takes and we'll set up AnyConnect.\n\n85\n00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:15.762\nAnd that's why we're just creating\na tunnel with the AnyConnect client to\n\n86\n00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:16.750\nthe ASA.\n\n87\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.610\nIn this point here, yeah, we're getting to\nthe ASA, but we're gonna do the portal.\n\n88\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.720\nSo, let's go ahead and, again,\nI'm gonna go to, let's run out here.\n\n89\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.390\nI don't care about that config.\n\n90\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.940\nAnd so, we'll go ahead make this big.\n\n91\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.770\nAnd one of the things I'm gonna\ndo is go to configuration, okay,\n\n92\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.000\nso very simple guys,\nlet's not make this harder than it is.\n\n93\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.348\nWe just got through make this work.\n\n94\n00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:43.218\nAnd we're gonna let this do the job for\nme with the advanced configuration.\n\n95\n00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:47.940\nSo, we're gonna say, wizards up here and\nnotice all the different and\n\n96\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.699\nlets talk about these\nhere if we can see this.\n\n97\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.000\nNow, I'm not covering site to site.\n\n98\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.640\nThis isn't on the exam objectives,\nbut this is the easiest one to set up.\n\n99\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.680\nI go to two ASAs.\n\n100\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.950\nI run this on both sides.\n\n101\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.110\nAnd then my tunnel comes\nup between two sites.\n\n102\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.140\nAnd this is very common, so I'm not\ngonna show it to you for time reasons.\n\n103\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.590\nAnd it's not that hard and\nit's not in the objectives.\n\n104\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.470\nBut if you just had, if you wanted to do a\nsite to site, here's your key right here.\n\n105\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.550\nPretty simple.\n\n106\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.390\nDo it on two of them.\n\n107\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.450\nNow, here's my Anyconnect.\n\n108\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.340\nWe're gonna run through that, but\n\n109\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.610\nI'm gonna start with the client list,\nSSL VPN Wizard.\n\n110\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.762\nSo, let's go ahead and have a look here.\n\n111\n00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:24.740\nAll right, so basically, here we are.\n\n112\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.060\nSo, it's even kinda showing us a picture\nof what we're trying to do here.\n\n113\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.902\nSo, it's browser based, so I'm gonna use\nmy browser to get into this portal, and\n\n114\n00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:37.440\nthen again the administrator or\nus will create bookmarks that allow us to,\n\n115\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.880\nallow the client or member to get in and\naccess resources on the network.\n\n116\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.980\nSo, it's a way to allow a tunnel in\n\n117\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.460\nwithout having to add any\nsoftware on the client.\n\n118\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.840\n>> And this is a little bit different\nthan the VPN's that most people think of.\n\n119\n00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.800\nMost of the time, you think of,\nhey my computer builds a VPN tunnel and\n\n120\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.810\nthen now all my traffic is going over it.\n\n121\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.980\nHere it's a web portal.\n\n122\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can run applications inside of\n\n123\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.070\nthat portal, and\nthere's pros and cons to that.\n\n124\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.170\nThe biggest advantage is\nexactly what Todd said.\n\n125\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.750\nWe don't have to install\na client on our machine.\n\n126\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.130\nYou just open up webpage and\nbrowse on the portal.\n\n127\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.360\nOn a negative, your application has\nto support being run in that portal.\n\n128\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.250\nAnd so, it might be something\nlike a remote desktop\n\n129\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.050\nsession to another system to be\nable to run your applications.\n\n130\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.430\nBut, there are some\nbigger limitations there.\n\n131\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.880\n>> Agreed.\nAs a network administrator,\n\n132\n00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.530\nI can get it working.\n\n133\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.440\nBut, I get then the clients are talking\nto the other administrator saying,\n\n134\n00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.570\nI don't have access, and\nI don't do Windows, right?\n\n135\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.550\n>> [LAUGH] So, there's a lot of\nwork on the back end of allow and\n\n136\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.560\naccess once you get in.\n\n137\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.180\nSo, I can get someone to access into the\nportal, and then you need, like you were\n\n138\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.910\nsaying, it's the application, the custom\napplication that we have to work on.\n\n139\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.950\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at some of that.\n\n140\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.012\nAnd if we responsible for\nboth, then it's gonna be busy.\n\n141\n00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:51.034\nSo, we're gonna say Todd,\nclient lists VPN, right?\n\n142\n00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:52.275\nCVPN, right?\n\n143\n00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:53.710\nThat sounds pretty good.\n\n144\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.530\nNow, typically, you're gonna say,\n\n145\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.530\nyeah we're coming in on\nthe outside interface here.\n\n146\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.510\nSo, creating a profile and\nit's gonna create profile on my ASA.\n\n147\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.618\nNow, in this sense here, I'm gonna come\nin just in this lab on the inside.\n\n148\n00:07:06.618 --> 00:07:10.530\nI'd find it rare that you would do this\nin production, but in this case we will.\n\n149\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.330\nNow we can also add certificates,\n\n150\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.920\nbut we don't have enough time\nthis week to do certificates.\n\n151\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.310\nThat's a whole course in itself.\n\n152\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.800\nDo you have a course in that?\n\n153\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.190\n>> We have a few like on the Windows site.\n\n154\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.030\nCuz it's not just, you don't just generate\na self-signed certificate and you're done.\n\n155\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.930\nIt's not that easy, right?\n\n156\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.400\nYou gotta have a certificate authority,\n\n157\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.210\nyou gotta set up a whole\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n158\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.230\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n159\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.200\nBut, it's worth it.\n\n160\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.510\n>> It is.\n\n161\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.810\nSo, we don't have to do that here and\nI'm not going to, and so\n\n162\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.330\nI'm not gonna use this.\n\n163\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.070\nBut, notice down here it says okay, when\nyou're done here, here's your https and\n\n164\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.230\nhere's where they're going to URL\naccess to the VPN service, right?\n\n165\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.710\nSo, I can long in as admin or this is\nwhat I would give to the user, so I.\n\n166\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.600\nSo, let me go ahead and press next.\n\n167\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.999\nIt's not that hard to do this.\n\n168\n00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:58.906\nNow, we typically would use a triple\nAcer over here, run a tack radius and\n\n169\n00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:03.194\nwe'd have our users and\ngroups in this, that's very typical.\n\n170\n00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:05.579\nAgain, I don't have that in here,\nit's not important.\n\n171\n00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:07.135\nI'm just going to use local user.\n\n172\n00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:12.062\nI can use the admin, but\nI'm going to create a new user, Todd and\n\n173\n00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:13.621\nput my password in.\n\n174\n00:08:17.908 --> 00:08:20.340\nAll right, and\nI'm going to add that user in here.\n\n175\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.923\nThere you go.\n\n176\n00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:21.619\nLike that.\n\n177\n00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:23.391\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's 1-2-3-4, right?\n\n178\n00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:25.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, this is probably,\n\n179\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.220\nyou know if you have a small company,\nyou don't have a triple-A server,\n\n180\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.322\nyou definitely can add users\nto the local database.\n\n181\n00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:38.640\nBut that'd be pretty rare that you\nwould use something like this.\n\n182\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.870\nBut, it's there, if you need it.\n\n183\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.770\n>> Now I can create a new group policy,\nor just use the default group policy.\n\n184\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.760\nIf you guys wanna create a new group\npolicy, we can go ahead and do that.\n\n185\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.110\nSo I'm gonna call this,\nI'll just call it Todd, and\n\n186\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.670\nnow I'm gonna have a new group policy.\n\n187\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.420\nAll right?\n\n188\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.550\nThen we need to know what to\ninspect in there and so on,\n\n189\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.130\nbut I have a new group policy just for\nthis client list as itself.\n\n190\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.850\nIt's not necessary that you do that.\n\n191\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.890\nI could have just modified this.\n\n192\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.790\nIt wouldn't have been an issue whatsoever.\n\n193\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.510\nSo it's completely up to you.\n\n194\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.130\nYou might just wanna name these VPNs so\nyou can see the group policy.\n\n195\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.500\nWhen you do a show run, you can go out and\nthen search for it, and see exactly for\n\n196\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.000\nthat group policy.\n\n197\n00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.690\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nmanage, and create bookmarks for\n\n198\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.240\nthe users to be able to get to it.\n\n199\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.810\nSo we don't have anything here.\n\n200\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.380\nI had one in there from another previous\nconfiguration that I was doing.\n\n201\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.620\nLet me go ahead and say manage.\n\n202\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.350\nNow, if you're studying the objectives my\nfriends, you're paying attention here.\n\n203\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.960\nAll right, so now the parameter is\nenforced in either a VPN group policy, or\n\n204\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.190\ndynamic access policy, or user policy.\n\n205\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.040\nAll right, so\nthat's what we're gonna ask you.\n\n206\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.959\nSo the Bookmark Lists that security\nappliance displays on the SSL VPN\n\n207\n00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:44.570\nportal page.\n\n208\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.000\nSo when we're getting into to portal,\nwhat can they get to?\n\n209\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.362\nWell, we're not gonna do much here,\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and say add.\n\n210\n00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:53.800\nI'll just keep using Todd,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n211\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.790\nNow there's some different things.\n\n212\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.050\nSelect an option.\n\n213\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.740\nI usually don't play with these in here.\n\n214\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.770\nYou can look these up in more detail.\n\n215\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.170\nIt's not important for\nwhat we're trying to do here.\n\n216\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.448\nBut I just use URL with GET or\nPOST method.\n\n217\n00:10:08.448 --> 00:10:11.378\nThis is the traditional\nmethod of doing it, right?\n\n218\n00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.730\nSo I just clicked Todd,\ncreated it, and said okay.\n\n219\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:20.436\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and\ncreate a title as Todd_Bookmark.\n\n220\n00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:25.640\nAnd I could put in some URLs and notice\nI have this I here for the assistant.\n\n221\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.630\nAnd I can click this and it tells me\nthe following variables that I could use.\n\n222\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.490\nSo, I'm going to say I want to use this\nlike user name or primary user name.\n\n223\n00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.700\nI can create a secondary user name and\nso on.\n\n224\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.500\nSo notice they have it.\n\n225\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.280\nI can click assistant and\nget some more information here.\n\n226\n00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:47.659\nBut in this case I think\nI just start typing.\n\n227\n00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:50.724\nOkay, CSCL, that's what I wanted.\n\n228\n00:10:50.724 --> 00:10:51.445\nThere we go.\n\n229\n00:10:51.445 --> 00:10:53.569\nAnd I\"ll use that Web VPN.\n\n230\n00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.564\nNow, for the objectives, okay,\nyou're still paying attention here, right?\n\n231\n00:10:56.564 --> 00:10:59.199\nThe Bookmarks making you pay attention.\n\n232\n00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:03.380\nWhat are the types of URLs\nthat you can look at?\n\n233\n00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.040\nAll right, we have HTTP.\n\n234\n00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.580\nWe have HTTPS.\n\n235\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.980\nCFS.\n\n236\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.840\nAnd FTP.\nAll right, this is important to you.\n\n237\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.410\nRight, so HTTP, I'm gonna use.\n\n238\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.920\nLeave this alone.\n\n239\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.290\nAnd now I wanna enable smart tunnel,\nand we'll talk about that.\n\n240\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.750\nSo this may send browser chat over\nsmart tunnel to the security appliance.\n\n241\n00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.470\nAnd this is going to allow me to\n\n242\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.660\nattach to my group policy and see what\ntraffic is being sent through that.\n\n243\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.870\nAnd so we're gonna go ahead and\nenable that for now.\n\n244\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.520\nSo let me see if I click\non something else.\n\n245\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.890\nSo this application will display\nin a separate web browser window.\n\n246\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.790\nWill pass securely over your VPN\nconnection unless a tunnel policy\n\n247\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.010\nother than a tunnel all is selected for\na group, policy, or user.\n\n248\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.730\nSo I usually use the smart tunnel.\n\n249\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.150\nIt helps my configuration here, okay?\n\n250\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.410\nAnd then there are some\nadvanced options here.\n\n251\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.930\nAnd again, I'm not gonna change these.\n\n252\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.470\nThese came up when I named it here, right?\n\n253\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.450\nAll right, so we'll make this small.\n\n254\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.660\nI'm going to say okay,\nhere's my bookmark here.\n\n255\n00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.660\nAnd come in here,\nI can edit, delete, or add.\n\n256\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.220\nAnd I'm going to say okay.\n\n257\n00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.550\nAnd then okay, so I can import bookmarks.\n\n258\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.040\nAnd what I would probably do is\ncreate them and then import them for\n\n259\n00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.920\neach of my ASAs that would do this\nbecause we haven't done very much.\n\n260\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.750\nAnd it can be time consuming.\n\n261\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.240\nAll right, so we have this in here,\nclientless connections.\n\n262\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.780\nAll right, so basically what was\n\n263\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.210\nthe biggest part that you wanna pick\nout of here is those bookmarks,\n\n264\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:37.024\nthe different ways we can do it,\nthe different http, https, cfs, and ftp.\n\n265\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.610\nAnd we also created a smart tunnel.\n\n266\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.297\nAnd then so we'll go ahead and take\na look at this configuration here, and\n\n267\n00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.971\nthis is what's going to be sent.\n\n268\n00:12:50.512 --> 00:12:53.540\nOkay, so\nthis is also called webvpn, right?\n\n269\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.040\nAnd we're gonna enable the inside,\nimport the url-list.\n\n270\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.980\nSo notice it's actually creating\na temporary file in flash, or\n\n271\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.740\nin this arrow right here.\n\n272\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.290\nAnd, it's going to delete the old one,\ncuz I had one there.\n\n273\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.985\nYou create a username, Todd,\ncuz I put the local user in.\n\n274\n00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:11.930\nVpn-group-policy, we named Todd.\n\n275\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.908\nGroup-policy, and then our attributes.\n\n276\n00:13:15.908 --> 00:13:18.200\nAnd, then remote-access.\n\n277\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.540\nSo, honestly, it's not like\nthis was really, really hard.\n\n278\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.370\nIt's just that going through all\nthese commands, not necessary.\n\n279\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.095\nSo we're going to say send and\nthen we'll see if this works.\n\n280\n00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:32.970\n[LAUGH] All right,\nif it doesn't work don't blame me.\n\n281\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.920\nSo we didn't do an awful lot in the sense\nof bookmarks and stuff like that.\n\n282\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.220\nSo in this case here, now I need\nto send this so I want to refresh.\n\n283\n00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:45.490\nSo we should have gotten, there it goes.\n\n284\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.840\nSo now it's updating.\n\n285\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.982\nSee if it's giving me any errors.\n\n286\n00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:57.495\n>> And while we're waiting on that,\nthe bookmarks are really important,\n\n287\n00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:59.950\nbecause that's where\nthe real power comes in.\n\n288\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.270\nSo while this should work,\nwe should be able to access that page,\n\n289\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.760\naccess the portal,\nwe're not gonna get very far.\n\n290\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.040\nAnd in your organization\nsomebody would log in and\n\n291\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.370\nthey would see that file share from\nthe cfs share that you had added.\n\n292\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.850\nOr they'd see the links to your\nintranet webpage,that's private for\n\n293\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.170\ninternal use only.\n\n294\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.890\nThey'd see a shortcut to\nlaunch remote desktop.\n\n295\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.240\nBut, Cisco actually has\na ton of little add in,\n\n296\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.560\nplug ins you can stick into this to\nbe able to access those resources,\n\n297\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.680\nthings like VNC and\nRemote Desktop and so on.\n\n298\n00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.980\nAnd that's where the true power comes in.\n\n299\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.230\nThey can launch this stuff and\ngain access to it.\n\n300\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.200\nWithout that, you have a portal\nthat somebody can log into,\n\n301\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.860\nand then they don't get very far.\n\n302\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.060\nAnd the other thing that\nwe'll wanna configure,\n\n303\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.820\nthat also gets outside of the ASA scope,\nis the user authentication.\n\n304\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.260\nYou want people to be able to log into\nthis thing with their username and\n\n305\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.260\npassword that they're used to.\n\n306\n00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.220\nYou don't wanna have to give\nthem a separate account.\n\n307\n00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.370\nAnd so if we have our ASA tied to\nsome kind of authentication server\n\n308\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:54.090\nthrough triple A, you can do Active\nDirectory LDAP servers right from the ASA.\n\n309\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.480\nThey introduced that a few versions ago.\n\n310\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.600\nIt's a great feature.\n\n311\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.320\nYou used to have to use\nsomething like Cisco ACS or\n\n312\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.705\na Radius server,\nwhich you can certainly still use, too.\n\n313\n00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:06.680\nSo for example, I've seen where\norganizations use RSA secure ID tokens.\n\n314\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.150\nAnd those RSA secure ID tokens just\nuse a Radius server on the back end.\n\n315\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.720\nSo when you log in,\nyou put in your username,\n\n316\n00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.280\nyou put in your current token number and\na PIN number, and\n\n317\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.820\nyou login, gain access to the portal,\nand then you can work with it.\n\n318\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.720\nAnd that's really nice,\n\n319\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.710\nbecause you might be accessing this\nportal from a non safe machine.\n\n320\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.040\nSo having that alternative for\nauthentication is a pretty useful thing.\n\n321\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.930\n>> All right, well let's go ahead and take\na look and see if we can get this working.\n\n322\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.020\nSo I ran through the configs,\nmade sure that they were there.\n\n323\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.410\nThis way up here and\nwe can see I added the new username.\n\n324\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.730\nI already had, I had admin added Todd,\nand you got attributes for\n\n325\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.570\nTodd in the group policy.\n\n326\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.260\nSo if everything worked right,\nand we'll see.\n\n327\n00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.250\nI should be able to.\n\n328\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.104\nYou know,\nthe one thing about client I'll say,\n\n329\n00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:49.898\nonce they get it working it always works,\nbut.\n\n330\n00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:51.350\nAnd I believe it was 10 11 10 dot 10?\n\n331\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.331\nIs that what they told\nme they should VPS in?\n\n332\n00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:55.534\nI believe I\"m right.\n\n333\n00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:57.180\nFind out here in a second.\n\n334\n00:15:59.260 --> 00:15:59.790\n>> I don't recall.\n\n335\n00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.296\nIt shows how much attention\nI pay to these things.\n\n336\n00:16:01.296 --> 00:16:02.155\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n337\n00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:05.283\n>> [LAUGH] If it happened more than 30\nseconds ago, it's already gone from memory\n\n338\n00:16:05.283 --> 00:16:07.854\n>> Let me go back here to do that show IP\n\n339\n00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:09.281\ncommand, right?\n\n340\n00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:15.850\nCuz it would be my inside 1011,\n1110 there we go.\n\n341\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.263\nThat was my error.\n\n342\n00:16:19.263 --> 00:16:20.220\nOkay, there we go.\n\n343\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.051\nWe're getting something.\n\n344\n00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.712\nNow, this could be not my web VPN,\nwe did do the ASDM before, so\n\n345\n00:16:24.712 --> 00:16:27.753\nI see that come up and\na lot of times when I do that one,\n\n346\n00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:31.301\nthen the portal doesn't come up,\ndepending on my browser.\n\n347\n00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:34.193\n>> And remember what Todd said\nearlier about how we weren't gonna do\n\n348\n00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:34.937\na certificate.\n\n349\n00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:37.706\nWe did a self-signed certificate, and so\nyou're gonna see a security warning like\n\n350\n00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:39.470\nthat, anytime you use\na self-signed certificate.\n\n351\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.904\nIf we had our own public\nkey infrastructure,\n\n352\n00:16:40.904 --> 00:16:41.959\nit would be a different story, or\n\n353\n00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.071\nif we bought a certificate from one\nof the big providers out there,\n\n354\n00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:45.073\nit would be a different story.\n\n355\n00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:48.384\n>> Yeah, I don't mean to look so shocked\non my face but this actually works.\n\n356\n00:16:48.384 --> 00:16:50.518\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of course it works.\n\n357\n00:16:50.518 --> 00:16:51.576\n>> Confidence inspiring.\n\n358\n00:16:51.576 --> 00:16:55.725\n>> Yeah, so we'll put in our name here,\nand password.\n\n359\n00:16:55.725 --> 00:17:00.690\n[LAUGH] And now,\nwe have our applications over here,\n\n360\n00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.520\nso let me bring this up, and\nthis is where you'd come in and\n\n361\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.440\ncreate your custom applications,\nand tells us how to do it.\n\n362\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.520\nAnd also, the access for\n\n363\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.990\nthat user on the AD would give them\nwhat networks they can browse and so on.\n\n364\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.590\nSo this would be their home, and in\nhere they would have their bookmarks and\n\n365\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.830\nthe other stuff that we created, so\nthere's my bookmark there, that I created.\n\n366\n00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.690\nSo again, what are you gonna pull of this?\n\n367\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:23.780\nWhat is it for?\n\n368\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.869\nAnd then,\nDon gave us some great explanations.\n\n369\n00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:28.104\nI was gonna go on break,\nhe was doing such a good job there.\n\n370\n00:17:28.104 --> 00:17:30.214\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then the other part was,\n\n371\n00:17:30.214 --> 00:17:33.900\nyou've got to pay attention to those\nbookmarks and how we do those, all right?\n\n372\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.210\nSo we're looking good with time, so\nI'd like to go on to the AnyConnect.\n\n373\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.610\n>> Sure.\nSo that was client list, and\n\n374\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.770\nyou saw, Todd did not install a client,\nhe just fired up a web browser and\n\n375\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.560\nthat was it, that's your client.\n\n376\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.625\nAnyConnect's a little bit different,\nright Todd?\n\n377\n00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:49.570\n>> AnyConnect is cuz we definitely\nneed some software on there.\n\n378\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.850\nAnd there's a couple of\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n379\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.800\nI can push it out through the web, right?\n\n380\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.079\nLike you know how we did ASTM and\nI said it can be pushed out?\n\n381\n00:17:56.079 --> 00:18:00.560\nWe didn't show it, but the fact was that\nI put that ASTM command in there and\n\n382\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.914\nthen I HTTPS into the ASA and it would\ngive me a, hey, download the ASTM.\n\n383\n00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:07.903\nWe could do the same thing with\nthis software as well, and\n\n384\n00:18:07.903 --> 00:18:11.460\nwe'll gonna go ahead and do that and\nshow it how to download.\n\n385\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.640\nOnce I do that,\nI won't be able to get in to this portal.\n\n386\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.240\nIt does kinda get a little\nconfused on browsers.\n\n387\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.980\nI'd have to use different\nbrowsers is what I noticed.\n\n388\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.900\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nclose this then.\n\n389\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.760\nSo where are we gonna go now?\n\n390\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.677\nWe're gonna go back to the wizard,\nall right?\n\n391\n00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:25.781\nWe're off to see the wizard.\n\n392\n00:18:25.781 --> 00:18:28.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n393\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.855\nAnd, so we're gonna come up here.\n\n394\n00:18:29.855 --> 00:18:34.790\nWizards > VPN > AnyConnect.\n\n395\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.310\nYeah, cuz we did the client list.\n\n396\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.370\nSo, on our [LAUGH] side,\nthat wasn't a lot of work.\n\n397\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.100\nBut it would've been some effort if we had\nto go through each one of those commands.\n\n398\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.500\nThis one's even a little more,\nmore commands.\n\n399\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.210\nSo this takes a few more minutes.\n\n400\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.356\nBut, again, on using the wizards on ASTM,\nman, I'm telling you, it's great.\n\n401\n00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:52.571\nAgain, we're seeing the picture.\n\n402\n00:18:52.571 --> 00:18:54.300\nThey're showing us what\nwe're trying to do here.\n\n403\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.130\nWe've got a local user.\n\n404\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.190\nIt has a public key, and\nwe're trying to get into the ASA here.\n\n405\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.880\nThis is my tunnel endpoint, all right?\n\n406\n00:19:04.988 --> 00:19:07.791\nConnection profile name, I don't know\nif maybe we should name it Todd.\n\n407\n00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:08.642\nHow about Don?\n\n408\n00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:09.677\n>> Sure, this one will be mine.\n\n409\n00:19:09.677 --> 00:19:12.180\n[CROSSTALK] I require, a client.\n\n410\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.041\n[LAUGH]\n>> What are we doing?\n\n411\n00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:14.095\nAnyConnect.\n\n412\n00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.211\nAC, how's that.\n\n413\n00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:16.340\nAnyConnect.\n\n414\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.440\nAnd again, for this lab only, use inside.\n\n415\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.777\nI find, you would find it really hard to\nbelieve that you'd come in from here,\n\n416\n00:19:21.777 --> 00:19:24.477\ninside interface and production,\nbut you could, I suppose.\n\n417\n00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:29.449\nNow, one of the things we're gonna do\nis we're not gonna do IPsec, right?\n\n418\n00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:31.610\nCuz we can do IPsec here,\nit's not necessary,\n\n419\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.590\nwe can still create an SSL,\nwhich is more than fine for most uses.\n\n420\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.680\nIf I leave this IPsec on here,\nnow we're configuring the certificate.\n\n421\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.338\nNow we're into another class, right?\n\n422\n00:19:42.338 --> 00:19:43.510\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n423\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.180\nthis is kind of giving me a summary of\nthe steps that I have to do with the VPN.\n\n424\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.570\nSo I'm gonna take that off, just use SSL.\n\n425\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.700\nMost of my clients do this, right?\n\n426\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.750\nWe just use the SSL.\n\n427\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.600\nDo you find that you're doing\ncertificates much with your clients?\n\n428\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.269\n>> Yeah, if you can use a public SSL\ncertificate, if you go and buy one,\n\n429\n00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:01.880\nit saves you so much time and effort.\n\n430\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.300\nYou save money by having your own,\n\n431\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.560\nit's just a lot of effort to\nbe able to maintain that.\n\n432\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.880\nSo I find that enterprises,\nlarge organizations, they'll do the pkadd,\n\n433\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.200\nthey'll each do their own certificate.\n\n434\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.110\nBut small, medium, even some large\nbusinesses just choose to purchase,\n\n435\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.044\ncuz it's a lot easier.\n\n436\n00:20:14.044 --> 00:20:17.479\n>> Absolutely, all right, so\nnow what we wanna do is say, all right.\n\n437\n00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:21.852\nWe're having users come out and we're\ntelling Bob from sales or the sales team,\n\n438\n00:20:21.852 --> 00:20:26.496\nhey, whenever you're gonna come in to our\nnetwork, you have to come in through VPN.\n\n439\n00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:31.755\nSo the first time you do, just HTTPS to\nour ASA, like I did with the bookmarks,\n\n440\n00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:36.796\nand it's going to prompt you to download\nthe software for the AnyConnect.\n\n441\n00:20:36.796 --> 00:20:38.277\nSo I'm gonna say, add the image.\n\n442\n00:20:38.277 --> 00:20:41.165\nSo the next thing it asks me is,\nhey what image do you wanna use?\n\n443\n00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:44.660\nWell, in this case here,\nI've already put this in Flash.\n\n444\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.740\nIt could be on disk and\nI can upload that there.\n\n445\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.600\nBut I'm gonna say Browse Flash, right?\n\n446\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.910\nBefore I put it in Flash,\nI had to get it from a directory.\n\n447\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.270\nSo I put it into a directory,\nand then uploaded it to Flash.\n\n448\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.200\nIn this case here, we're gonna see it\nhere AnyConnect, there it is right there.\n\n449\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.180\nSo I'm gonna connect on this guy\nright here, this is what we're using.\n\n450\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.370\nSay OK.\n\n451\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.090\nAnd that's the file we want, so\nwhen someone comes and connects to me,\n\n452\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.180\nthat's what they're gonna\nbe prompted to download.\n\n453\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.830\nMakes it pretty easy, right?\n\n454\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.335\nSo, now I don't have to go out to\neach host, as soon as they connect up\n\n455\n00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:18.325\nto the ASA, it automatically\nis gonna ask them to download.\n\n456\n00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:19.889\nNow, again, we have that local user.\n\n457\n00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:22.628\nI already got Todd in here,\nno sense on the ASA,\n\n458\n00:21:22.628 --> 00:21:25.180\nit's looking in my local database.\n\n459\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.724\nAgain, we're gonna have typically,\nradius triple ace over here,\n\n460\n00:21:28.724 --> 00:21:31.473\nright, through our AD but\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n461\n00:21:31.473 --> 00:21:34.360\nwe'll just use Todd again or\nadmin, doesn't matter.\n\n462\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.680\nI could have created a Don, I guess,\nsince we were doing a Don profile.\n\n463\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.370\nWe definitely need a pool, right?\n\n464\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.305\nThey need an IP address, so I'm just gonna\nmake up a pool that they're going to get\n\n465\n00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.375\nwhen they connect up with this VPN tunnel.\n\n466\n00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:51.684\nSo I'm gonna say, Don any connect pool.\n\n467\n00:21:51.684 --> 00:21:53.003\nHow's that sound?\n\n468\n00:21:53.003 --> 00:21:53.926\nOkay?\nAnd then,\n\n469\n00:21:53.926 --> 00:21:58.125\nit's basically helped me walk\nthrough adding an IP address here.\n\n470\n00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:07.108\nI'm not gonna do that, but I could say\n172.16.10.1 through 172.16.10.100.\n\n471\n00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:10.952\nNow I can type out the mask, or if I'm\nreally lazy I can pull this down arrow\n\n472\n00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:13.260\nhere, and\nit makes it pretty simple for us.\n\n473\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.610\nSay OK.\n\n474\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.422\nNow, I've got my pool.\n\n475\n00:22:18.422 --> 00:22:20.474\nAnd DNS servers, right?\n\n476\n00:22:20.474 --> 00:22:25.450\n8.8.8.8,4.4.4.4.\n\n477\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.522\nWin servers, domain names.\n\n478\n00:22:27.522 --> 00:22:29.889\nWe don't get a lot of\ninformation from here, but\n\n479\n00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:32.682\nwe shouldn't need a lot coming\nin here like this, okay?\n\n480\n00:22:32.682 --> 00:22:35.610\nNow, here's what we do wanna remember,\nthough.\n\n481\n00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.910\nWe don't want these guys to do our NAT.\n\n482\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.300\nSo we had configured NAT already, but\n\n483\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.700\nwe don't want them to go\nthrough our NAT translation.\n\n484\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.540\nWe want them to connect and\nbe exempt from that.\n\n485\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.550\nIf you don't do this,\nit just typically doesn't work.\n\n486\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.160\nSo there might be some use cases for that.\n\n487\n00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.390\nBut I've always exempted it, right?\n\n488\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.120\nSo just outside,\n\n489\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.380\nwe're doing the inside interface that's\nconnected to my internal network.\n\n490\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.700\nThe local four is called any4.\n\n491\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.970\nIf we were to look at my interfaces,\nthat's what it named it.\n\n492\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.570\nOkay, so then we're exempting it from NAT.\n\n493\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.795\nThen if you're in doubt,\nalways click this, right?\n\n494\n00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:11.379\nAll right, so that's about it.\n\n495\n00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:13.340\nAnd then,\nwe're gonna talk about the deployment.\n\n496\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.970\nBasically, it's gonna say,\nopen up a web browser and we can do that.\n\n497\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.280\nI don't know if that will come up again.\n\n498\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.700\nI always get that disclaimer last time,\nbecause it works most of the time, but\n\n499\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.010\nnot every time, so\nI'm just gonna leave this.\n\n500\n00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.770\nThis is basically what we're doing here.\n\n501\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.230\nThere were some thought involved,\nI've been through this quite a bit, so\n\n502\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.010\nI kinda worked through it.\n\n503\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.670\nIt would take a little bit more time and\nthought and\n\n504\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.310\neffort on your side to get this done and\nunderstanding what you're trying to do.\n\n505\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.790\nOkay, so we'll finish this.\n\n506\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.648\nNow, let's take a look\nmore at this command.\n\n507\n00:23:43.648 --> 00:23:48.940\nSo first of, the pool here, but notice,\nlook at this, we created an object, right?\n\n508\n00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.190\nSo, now we have a network\nobject here with a sub net.\n\n509\n00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.620\nAll right, so that's kinda cool,\nso we got that object in here.\n\n510\n00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.140\nHere's my web VPN,\ntunnel group, AnyConnect image.\n\n511\n00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.617\nEnable AnyConnect.\n\n512\n00:24:01.617 --> 00:24:03.623\nMy group policy DonAC internal, right?\n\n513\n00:24:03.623 --> 00:24:05.109\nThe attributes.\n\n514\n00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:09.380\nAnd then, part of the attributes of\nthe DHCP pool we're gonna hand out.\n\n515\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:15.452\nTunnel group is remote access,\ngeneral attributes.\n\n516\n00:24:15.452 --> 00:24:16.060\nYou know what?\n\n517\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.288\nI want to go through here because I,\nI just sent this.\n\n518\n00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:22.720\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> [LAUGHS] Because we're kind of not\n\n519\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.370\nquite done.\n\n520\n00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.470\n>> Well, you know.\n\n521\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.080\nFrom the commands that were\non screen right there,\n\n522\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.010\nyou guys could see, Todd said, hey I\ndon't really like to use the ASDM much.\n\n523\n00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.890\nBut you guys get an idea.\n\n524\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.090\nYou saw all the commands.\n\n525\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.850\n>> Wow. Yeah. >> It'd be pretty\nhard to do that from memory,\n\n526\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.200\nalthough you've already spotted\none thing that we need to add.\n\n527\n00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.280\nSo, [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n528\n00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.320\nSo let's come back here and\n\n529\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.910\ntake a look, we're not quite done\neven though it shows that we are.\n\n530\n00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.270\nIt won't work as it is, believe it or not.\n\n531\n00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.800\nSo if you go and do this,\npush this out and you're like what, right?\n\n532\n00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.720\nSo, the fact is we've got\nto do a couple things.\n\n533\n00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.170\nLet's take a look here, so,\nnotice first we're enabling CISCO on\n\n534\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:25:00.060\nany interfaces below,\nwe're just definitely using the inside and\n\n535\n00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.990\ndetail us is going to\nmake it more efficiently.\n\n536\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.190\nNow we can also see which\nprofiles we're using here.\n\n537\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:13.114\nThis one here is just SSL enabled, so now\nwe should have been able to go back and\n\n538\n00:25:13.114 --> 00:25:17.958\nhad a bunch of, you know what,\nI didn't have on logging.\n\n539\n00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:26.610\nAll right, so we've got that there and\nI'm gonna say refresh.\n\n540\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.450\nOkay, that's gonna put it in there.\n\n541\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.310\nBut before we go on,\nnow we have to create user profiles.\n\n542\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.320\nSo basically you need to push out\na configuration to the clients,\n\n543\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.600\nother than just the AnyConnect,\nwe also need to give them a profile.\n\n544\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.730\nOkay, so we're gonna click Connect\non the left hand side here,\n\n545\n00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.930\nAnyConnect Client Profile.\n\n546\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.090\nOkay, so\nwhat we were doing here it's very simple,\n\n547\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.980\nbut you still have more work to do and\nthis is in the client profiles.\n\n548\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.934\nAgain, if you're in your objectives,\nthis becomes very important to you.\n\n549\n00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:02.742\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna manage that client profiles,\n\n550\n00:26:02.742 --> 00:26:05.663\nthis allows them to create profiles,\nput them in flash, and\n\n551\n00:26:05.663 --> 00:26:09.930\nany time someone connects up, it downloads\nthis configuration for the client, okay?\n\n552\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:17.120\nOkay, and then I'm gonna saw Don,\nunder certain [INAUDIBLE].\n\n553\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.025\nSo I named it after him, because if\nit doesn't work then it's his fault.\n\n554\n00:26:20.025 --> 00:26:21.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In VPN profile.\n\n555\n00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.890\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're going to see the profile name.\n\n556\n00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.730\nIt actually created it,\nand here is an objective.\n\n557\n00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.455\nWhen you create a profile\nwhat's the extension?\n\n558\n00:26:28.455 --> 00:26:30.810\n.xml, right.\n\n559\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.480\nSo there you go.\n\n560\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.480\nThis is the kind of thing you're\nlooking at for the objectives.\n\n561\n00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.218\nAll right.\n\n562\n00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:37.370\nAnd I'm going to take Don.\n\n563\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:42.470\nThere's a group policy Don, so this is\nthe group policy we're going to use, okay.\n\n564\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.150\nNow I could browse flash and\nuse one that's already there, right?\n\n565\n00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.638\nA preconfigured one, have it in there,\nand use it for this, but\n\n566\n00:26:47.638 --> 00:26:48.896\nwe're creating a new one here.\n\n567\n00:26:51.497 --> 00:26:54.740\nOkay and now once we create it,\nwe have to edit it.\n\n568\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.904\n[LAUGH] I know that sounds funny but,\nyou know,\n\n569\n00:26:56.904 --> 00:27:00.902\nit wasn't all there because here's kind of\nwhat you guys, you're going to find is if\n\n570\n00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:04.622\nyou're on a remote network this isn't\ngoing to work, because if we come down to\n\n571\n00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:07.588\nhere it says Windows VPN Establishment\nis for local user only.\n\n572\n00:27:07.588 --> 00:27:09.213\nAnd this is the one that got me for\na long time.\n\n573\n00:27:09.213 --> 00:27:11.206\nI can't tell you how long it\ntook me to find this one.\n\n574\n00:27:11.206 --> 00:27:15.030\nBut we want this to allow remote\nusers to be able to do this.\n\n575\n00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.150\nAll right, so.\n\n576\n00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.570\nThis one almost got me.\n\n577\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.020\nBut I eventually found it, got over it.\n\n578\n00:27:24.047 --> 00:27:24.678\nAll right.\n\n579\n00:27:24.678 --> 00:27:26.770\nAnd then we're gonna say apply.\n\n580\n00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.570\nLet's bring up this guy,\nsee if he's there.\n\n581\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.318\nLooks like he's doing something there.\n\n582\n00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:36.250\nAnd then here's the configuration so we\ndidn't do a lot here, let's take a look.\n\n583\n00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:40.020\nWebVpn profiles Don,\nGroupPolicy attributes,\n\n584\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.510\nthis is telling you right here\nwhen a user connects, and\n\n585\n00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.850\nusing this GroupPolicy that they\nneed to download this profile.\n\n586\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.520\nNow, profile's gonna allow remote users\ninto my Windows environment right?\n\n587\n00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.801\nSo I'm gonna send that.\n\n588\n00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:55.295\nIt's kinda that there was a key\npoint what I just went through guys.\n\n589\n00:27:55.295 --> 00:28:00.260\nGot to be honest with you, it's not\nsomething that you can find easily.\n\n590\n00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.810\nOkay.\nSo we're going to let that go for awhile.\n\n591\n00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.105\nWe're going to upgrade.\n\n592\n00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.628\nAll right.\n\n593\n00:28:09.628 --> 00:28:12.330\nSo, hold on,\nI think I missed the split tunnel part.\n\n594\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.301\nThis is why I keep my directions\non this one here because\n\n595\n00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:18.770\nwe're gonna be doing something\ncalled a split tunnel.\n\n596\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.880\nNow, this is kind of complicated and\na little bit more advanced for this class,\n\n597\n00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.140\nnot in the objectives.\n\n598\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.100\nBut basically I'm tunneled\ninto my ASA right now.\n\n599\n00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.810\nCuz I'm already Ped into my network\nwhich is basically a tunnel into my ASA.\n\n600\n00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.140\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is enable\nanother tunnel on top of that.\n\n601\n00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.810\nSo, we're basically are splitting\nthe tunnel in two directions.\n\n602\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.923\nRight, so you very well may do this.\n\n603\n00:28:38.923 --> 00:28:42.520\nIf so,\nwe're going to go to group policies now.\n\n604\n00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.725\nI knew I was forgetting something, so,\nlet's go up here to group policies.\n\n605\n00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:49.991\nNow, remember, you've got to be careful\nbecause you're under client lists where\n\n606\n00:28:49.991 --> 00:28:52.107\nyour just doing this so\nif you're doing client lists,\n\n607\n00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:54.450\nyou're going to see\nyour group policy here.\n\n608\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.790\nSo remember where you are, you're in\nthe client SSL, or any connect, so\n\n609\n00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.020\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ngo to group policy.\n\n610\n00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.670\nAnd we're using Don's group policy,\nhe, ok.\n\n611\n00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.828\nClick on my policy, and I'm going to,\nedit this, so we're, Don,\n\n612\n00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:13.883\nlike I said, using Don,\nin case it doesn't work.\n\n613\n00:29:13.883 --> 00:29:18.270\nAnd one of the things that I need\nto do is come to advanced, and\n\n614\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.390\nclick on split tunneling, all right.\n\n615\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.110\nNow you may or may not be doing this,\nbut let me tell you something,\n\n616\n00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.630\nif you are, this is so hard to find.\n\n617\n00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.250\nAll right, it did take me a little while\nto dig in here and figure out the split\n\n618\n00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.730\ntunneling, it was actually easier for\nme to go the CLA at that point.\n\n619\n00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.380\nJust cuz I understood split tunneling.\n\n620\n00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.090\nBut the fact if you don't understand split\ntunneling, but rather you're coming in\n\n621\n00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.530\nwith a tunnel and you're creating\nanother tunnel on top of that,\n\n622\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.280\nthen you're gonna have to go in here and\nallow this with an access list.\n\n623\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.081\nLet's take a look.\n\n624\n00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:47.090\nI'm gonna click on this and I'm gonna say,\nso I'm gonna click on network list here.\n\n625\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.750\nRight?\n\n626\n00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.707\nAnd we're basically let everything\ninherit from the top group policy.\n\n627\n00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:52.970\nBut in this one here we're not going to.\n\n628\n00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:56.123\nI'm gonna go ahead and notice that\nthere's nothing here I'm gonna manage.\n\n629\n00:29:56.123 --> 00:29:58.642\nAnd I'm gonna add.\n\n630\n00:29:58.642 --> 00:30:02.441\nOkay, now, this is Add ACL.\n\n631\n00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:04.732\nAll right, this is about as advance\nas you can get on the ASDL,\n\n632\n00:30:04.732 --> 00:30:06.310\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n633\n00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.734\nAdd ACL, and\nwe're gonna call this Don_Hope_it_works.\n\n634\n00:30:10.734 --> 00:30:14.080\n>> [LAUGH] That's my middle name,\nactually.\n\n635\n00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.551\nDon Hope-It-Works.\n\n636\n00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:17.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n637\n00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.710\nwe got the AC of me.\n\n638\n00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.200\nAll right.\nAre we done?\n\n639\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.414\nNo.\nNow we gotta go and edit this guy and\n\n640\n00:30:23.414 --> 00:30:26.860\nwe are going to need\nto add into it an ACE.\n\n641\n00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.430\nOut here they call it an ACE,\nAccess Control Entry, right?\n\n642\n00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:36.160\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\npermit, and my network is 10.0.0.0/8.\n\n643\n00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.430\nAnd so I'm gonna say OK, and there it is.\n\n644\n00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.320\nSo we permitted that.\n\n645\n00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:42.790\nOkay?\n\n646\n00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.971\nAnd now we should be able to,\nlet me say OK to this.\n\n647\n00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:49.039\nAnd it would update, should now update.\n\n648\n00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:51.009\nSo now I'm doing split tunnelling.\n\n649\n00:30:51.009 --> 00:30:56.560\nAnd allowing the ten that were to\ncome across my tunnel already, right?\n\n650\n00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.049\nJust say, OK, and then Refresh,\nsay OK, all right.\n\n651\n00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:03.926\nAnd that's actually refresh in ASTM but\n\n652\n00:31:03.926 --> 00:31:07.150\nwe should be seeing this thing\ngo crazy over here, right?\n\n653\n00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.475\nAll right.\nSo we're gonna let that run for\n\n654\n00:31:08.475 --> 00:31:09.740\na second and we're updating that.\n\n655\n00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.073\nAnd we should be okay to browse in.\n\n656\n00:31:13.073 --> 00:31:14.232\nYou wanna try Don?\n\n657\n00:31:14.232 --> 00:31:17.630\n[LAUGH] It's his tunnel,\nif it doesn't work.\n\n658\n00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.850\n>> You know you're talking about\nsplit tunneling and I know for\n\n659\n00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.750\nsome of the security professionals out\nthere they might know that split tunneling\n\n660\n00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.040\nis generally, it's a nasty word, right,\nbecause the risk is, and a typical VPN\n\n661\n00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.260\ntunnel, when you connect 100% of your\ntraffic is sent over that tunnel.\n\n662\n00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.480\nBut when you enable split tunneling,\nnow you can divide it up.\n\n663\n00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.420\nAnd the way Todd's about to do it is\nwhere you divide it up between two secure\n\n664\n00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.590\nnetworks, but\nthe way some people implement it\n\n665\n00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.790\nis where they'll have where you VPN in and\nyour business traffic,\n\n666\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.640\ntraffic to IP ranges that are at the\noffice, go over the tunnel and everything\n\n667\n00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.660\nelse goes straight out, like straight out\nto the Internet People do that when they\n\n668\n00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.960\nwant to take internet traffic off of\nthe VPN tunnel to save bandwidth, or\n\n669\n00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.130\nsave processing power, but\nthink about the risk there, right?\n\n670\n00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.372\nThe risk is you've now got a client with\nunfiltered access to the internet on\n\n671\n00:32:01.372 --> 00:32:05.428\nan untrusted network, and\nprotected access to your internal network.\n\n672\n00:32:05.428 --> 00:32:08.772\nYou're effectively opening yourself up for\nlike a leapfrog attack.\n\n673\n00:32:08.772 --> 00:32:11.651\nSomebody could jump into the laptop and\nthen across over into your network.\n\n674\n00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:14.176\nSo a lot of people choose to\nleave split tunneling off and\n\n675\n00:32:14.176 --> 00:32:16.720\njust send all of the traffic\nover the tunnel.\n\n676\n00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.550\nIt's gonna be up to you and\nyour security policies, but\n\n677\n00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.980\nthe ACLs that Tom was writing right there,\n\n678\n00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.310\nthat's how you dictate what you're\ngoing to allow and what you're not.\n\n679\n00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.610\nIt's important that you get it set right\nfor the security policies of your company.\n\n680\n00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.980\n>> All right, so\nwe've got our, whatever we got.\n\n681\n00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.515\nWe did our SSL client list,\nsaw the portal.\n\n682\n00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:34.820\nThere's still a lot of work behind the\nscenes that an administrator has to do to\n\n683\n00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.740\nget that portal given there are network\naccess and their file access and so\n\n684\n00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.980\non and specifically application,\nand that's why you would do it.\n\n685\n00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.160\nAnd it's super cool for\nthe end user experience side, right.\n\n686\n00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.000\nNow, the AnyConnect actually\nworks pretty darn well.\n\n687\n00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.290\nIt's probably the best VPN client\nI've ever used and, again,\n\n688\n00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.142\nI'm saying something really nice\nabout Cisco, which is annoying to me.\n\n689\n00:32:54.142 --> 00:32:54.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n690\n00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.640\nThat's not something I like to do to too\nmuch, but I have to give them their props.\n\n691\n00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.560\nThey bought Firepower before I did.\n\n692\n00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.450\nAll right, so we're gonna go here,\nwe're gonna go back to the same place.\n\n693\n00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.750\nI'm using the same browser so\n\n694\n00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.610\nI'm gonna just tell you I'm thinking\nthis might work, it depends.\n\n695\n00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.100\nNow it brought me up into the portal,\nright, and\n\n696\n00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.890\nin this case here if I\nuse a different browser.\n\n697\n00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:20.600\nSo now I'm back in the portal and\nwe can see the different default groups.\n\n698\n00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.640\nSo now we're into our Clientless SSL.\n\n699\n00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.090\nI think if I use a different\nbrowser I think.\n\n700\n00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.280\nAnd it's kind of the problem\nwhen you're doing AnyConnect,\n\n701\n00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.200\nyou want to download it and\nyou have that portal as well.\n\n702\n00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.340\nIt's kinda,\nI couldn't tell the difference.\n\n703\n00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.960\nI'd have to clear the cookies out I think,\nright.\n\n704\n00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.510\n>> That's something we have to be really\ncareful with when we're dealing with\n\n705\n00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.540\nSSL VPN's especially, right.\n\n706\n00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.670\nYour web browser can cache your\ncredentials and what happens for\n\n707\n00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.110\nan administrator like us,\nis when we go the the, the page, for\n\n708\n00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.840\nthe portal we log in as an admin,\nwe expect to see the administration page\n\n709\n00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.360\nwhich let's us download the the ASDM,\nand download the other things.\n\n710\n00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.290\nBut an end user, they expect to see\nthe login portal to be able to so\n\n711\n00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.430\nthe Clientless SSL VPN, right,\nso they get in there and\n\n712\n00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.050\nsee all the applications they can run.\n\n713\n00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.900\nSo it's two different experiences,\nand some web browsers like\n\n714\n00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.670\nChrome can cache that information,\nso now when you come back to try and\n\n715\n00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.390\njust get the basic client install,\nit messes you up.\n\n716\n00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:14.020\nAnd most people don't use both,\nthe Clientless as well as AnyConnect.\n\n717\n00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.080\nThey usually pick one or\nthe other and so it's not a problem.\n\n718\n00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.620\nBut if you do use both you\nmight have to clear your cache,\n\n719\n00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.280\nclear your browsing history,\ncookies, whatever, or\n\n720\n00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.590\nlaunch in an incognito mode or one of\nthose things to be able to access it.\n\n721\n00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.170\n>> All right,\nthat's absolutely right, Don.\n\n722\n00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.860\nSo I use multiple browsers when\nI'm configuring stuff like this\n\n723\n00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.580\nbecause it makes it a lot easier\nthan trying to figure out.\n\n724\n00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.070\nIt's so hard sometimes to go out and\nclear the cache in Chrome and whatnot.\n\n725\n00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.980\nSo anyways I'm gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n726\n00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.540\nAnd notice I get my login.\n\n727\n00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.530\nIt looks like I'm kind of at the portal\nand but I'm just going to log in Todd or\n\n728\n00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.920\nI'm going to try to log in Todd.\n\n729\n00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.180\nAnd what was the name of my password?\n\n730\n00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.140\nAnd you guys are going to see this is\nwhat your customer or your user will see.\n\n731\n00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.760\nMy gosh it's going out there.\n\n732\n00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.780\nGave me a Java error.\n\n733\n00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.300\nI can't believe that.\n\n734\n00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.530\n>> My Java.\n>> Now I use a different Java type for\n\n735\n00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.370\nthis than I was using for\nthe ASD, Don, you love that?\n\n736\n00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.860\nSo now it's gonna go out there.\n\n737\n00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.030\nThis will actually take a second and\ncome back and tell me I can't do it.\n\n738\n00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.560\nSo in other words it was trying\nto AutoInstall with Java.\n\n739\n00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.810\nIt'll fail, and\nthen it'll ask me to download.\n\n740\n00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:11.460\nSo this is pretty cool.\n\n741\n00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.300\nSo we're at a good spot.\n\n742\n00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.470\nWe're working, connected up,\nour tunnel's gonna come up.\n\n743\n00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.190\nWe're gonna get the AnyConnect\nclient download, and\n\n744\n00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.340\nwe just put in the username and\npassword we put in there.\n\n745\n00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.200\nAnd we're gonna create our tunnel,\nso it's worked pretty well.\n\n746\n00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.160\n>> Yeah, and the big advantage of this,\nyou might be thinking, well boy,\n\n747\n00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.310\nthe other one was Clientless.\n\n748\n00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.420\nWe just logged into a portal and that was\nit, we didn't have to install a client.\n\n749\n00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.146\nHere we do, so that sounds worse, right?\n\n750\n00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:34.800\nWell the trade off is in exchange for\ninstalling that client,\n\n751\n00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.640\nyou get full access to your resources and\napplications across the network.\n\n752\n00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.200\nThis isn't just what's registered\nin the portal like bookmarks or\n\n753\n00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.590\nremote desktop sessions.\n\n754\n00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.420\nThis is everything,\nyour file shares, your web access,\n\n755\n00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.165\nyou can access to the Internet,\nany third party programs,\n\n756\n00:35:50.165 --> 00:35:53.730\nit all can go to that tunnel just\nby installing a little agent.\n\n757\n00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.275\nAnd so this is the way, I don't know about\nyou Tom, but I find that more people use\n\n758\n00:35:57.275 --> 00:35:59.640\nAnyConnect than they do with\nthe Clientless SSL, is it?\n\n759\n00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.710\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n760\n00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.230\nThe Clientless SSL is great,\n\n761\n00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.120\nthere's still maybe possibly some\nsecurity risk on something like that.\n\n762\n00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.570\nWhere this is gonna give us\nbetter security for sure.\n\n763\n00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.528\nAnd by using Detail S it's gonna\nchose the best type of tunnel, and\n\n764\n00:36:11.528 --> 00:36:15.510\nAnyConnect actually comes back and chooses\nthe best, most efficient protocols.\n\n765\n00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.800\nSo Any Connect is a great supplicant\nto use on something like this,\n\n766\n00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.250\nto provide the most\nefficiency with Detain S, and\n\n767\n00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.100\nto provide the best protocols with an IP\nsect to give you the best security.\n\n768\n00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.540\nIt does this all in the background\nwithout you having to worry about much or\n\n769\n00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.820\nyour clients screwing up or having to\npick any configurations, stuff like that.\n\n770\n00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.568\nSo the key that you guys want to pick out\nof this group is the client profiles and\n\n771\n00:36:39.568 --> 00:36:40.676\nthey end in what?\n\n772\n00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:41.594\n>> Those XNL files.\n\n773\n00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:43.886\n>> XNL, ended in XNL.\n\n774\n00:36:43.886 --> 00:36:44.719\nAnd what else did we do?\n\n775\n00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:46.635\nThe split tunneling.\n\n776\n00:36:46.635 --> 00:36:48.891\nIn this whole section here,\nwas pretty good.\n\n777\n00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:54.170\nThe only thing we didn't do again, notice\nit came up here and if we look at here\n\n778\n00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:59.070\nit gave me my Java error, right, and said\nhey I can't do it, it was unsuccessful.\n\n779\n00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.710\nBut I can go ahead and\njust download it from here and\n\n780\n00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.850\nthis is what your most clients will see,\nright.\n\n781\n00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.025\nJava, I'm just shocked we got a Java\nerror, I'm shocked I tell you.\n\n782\n00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:09.379\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyways, [LAUGH] so\n\n783\n00:37:09.379 --> 00:37:12.050\nthe only thing we didn't\ndo is site to site and\n\n784\n00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.810\nthat would only take\na few minutes if that.\n\n785\n00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.160\nNone of these are really hard.\n\n786\n00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.425\nThere were a few details on the Clientless\nSSL, that was pretty straight forward.\n\n787\n00:37:20.425 --> 00:37:21.530\nWe just follow the thing,\n\n788\n00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.293\nbut when we got to the AnyConnect we had\nto do things like the bookmarks, and\n\n789\n00:37:25.293 --> 00:37:30.550\nwe went into the profiles, created the\npool, and we needed a separate DHCP pool.\n\n790\n00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.620\nAnd then when we went\ninto the group policy and\n\n791\n00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.790\nconfigured that to allow\nthem remote access.\n\n792\n00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.190\nSo there's a few details that once you\nget that done, the Clientless was done,\n\n793\n00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.300\nwe pushed it out and\nit came up, and worked.\n\n794\n00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.570\nThe AnyConnect was done,\nwe pushed it out, and\n\n795\n00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.360\nthen we configured a couple more things.\n\n796\n00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.070\nAll right, so just keep those in mind and\nyou'll be golden.\n\n797\n00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.728\n>> Yep, and if you want to see site to\nsite VPN, you've probably already seen it,\n\n798\n00:37:50.728 --> 00:37:53.800\nwe did it in the CC&A show and\nI know we do it in CC&A security also.\n\n799\n00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.730\nSo you can jump over to a few different\nshows on our site and catch those.\n\n800\n00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.560\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n801\n00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.740\nSo site to site VPN, great for\nconnecting building to building.\n\n802\n00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.540\nWe've got the Clientless SSL,\nwhich is great for\n\n803\n00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:08.120\nproviding people access to applications\nthrough a web portal with no client, and\n\n804\n00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.730\nthen we saw AnyConnect which\nis really the most common.\n\n805\n00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.340\nAnd that's where we give a single\nclient access to the network, and\n\n806\n00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.400\nany application can run over that network.\n\n807\n00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.655\nAll three pretty easy to deploy\nthanks to the ASDM's wizards and\n\n808\n00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:20.552\nwe just get them up and running.\n\n809\n00:38:20.552 --> 00:38:23.020\nAll right Todd, that's a pretty\ngood spot for us to wrap things up.\n\n810\n00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.482\nDo you have anything\nelse you wanted to add?\n\n811\n00:38:24.482 --> 00:38:26.300\n>> No, I think it's a lot of fun.\n\n812\n00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.150\nVPM's are absolutely\nphenomenally fun when they work.\n\n813\n00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.440\n>> [LAUGH] When they work but\nthey provide a valuable service for us, so\n\n814\n00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.252\ndefinitely something you're\ngoing to make use out of.\n\n815\n00:38:35.252 --> 00:38:37.630\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's going to wrap up this episode.\n\n816\n00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.887\nI do hope you guys enjoy it.\n\n817\n00:38:38.887 --> 00:38:45.178\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n818\n00:38:45.178 --> 00:38:45.969\nI will get it.\n\n819\n00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:47.969\n>> And actually I think we're\ngonna start the firepower now.\n\n820\n00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:49.886\nComing up in the next episode.\n\n821\n00:38:49.886 --> 00:38:51.027\nSo stick around.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n822\n00:38:51.027 --> 00:38:51.527\n>> That will be good.\n\n823\n00:38:51.527 --> 00:38:52.068\nThat will definitely be good.\n\n824\n00:38:52.068 --> 00:38:52.653\n>> So stick around.\n\n825\n00:38:52.653 --> 00:38:53.153\n>> All right, well thank you guys for\n\n826\n00:38:53.153 --> 00:38:55.183\nwatching.\nSigning off for ITProTv, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n827\n00:38:55.183 --> 00:38:56.183\n>> And Todd Lamley.\n\n828\n00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:58.141\n>> And we'll see you next

evening and welcome back\nto another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.710\nI'm your host Don Pezet Back\nagain with another episode of\n\n5\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.480\nCisco ASA Express Security, and\nI'm pretty excited to be where we\n\n6\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.600\nare right now cuz we're ready to start the\nfire power section which really makes up\n\n7\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.100\nthe whole second half on this course,\nbecause it's one of the biggest part of\n\n8\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100\nimplementing security on the ASA these\ndays, really impressive technologies.\n\n9\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.560\nWe're gonna get a chance to see that And\nguiding us through it as always,\n\n10\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.920\nMr Todd here in the studio with me.\n\n11\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.980\n>> Yay.\n>> And Todd, it's firepower.\n\n12\n00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.570\nI know this is something you're\nreally passionate about so\n\n13\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.720\nI'm gonna turn it over to you.\n\n14\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.260\nWhere do we start?\n\n15\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.440\n>> I'm not sure I just read about\nit on the way out, so I don't know.\n\n16\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.430\n>> [LAUGH] I saw the brochure.\n\n17\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.200\n>> Yeah, firepower is\n>> I thought it had to do with ammo\n\n18\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.735\nor something.\n\n19\n00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:58.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway so FirePOWER, you guys, so\n\n20\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.510\nif you followed along on the earlier,\nwhere are we?\n\n21\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.080\nModules, seminars,\nwhat do we call these again?\n\n22\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.888\nEpisode, sorry.\n\n23\n00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:08.150\n[LAUGH] Following episodes,\nwe were configuring the ASA,\n\n24\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.230\nwe went through some\npretty good configuration.\n\n25\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230\nSome fun, getting things started\nthrough scratch, going through, and\n\n26\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.450\nnow we're here, and one of the things\nI have to do is push packets,\n\n27\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.660\nwhen they come in the ASA,\nto the source file module, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.050\nSo how do I do that?\n\n29\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.890\nWell, we talked about\nhow do we inspect them?\n\n30\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.800\nInto a class map, so we gotta create\na class map and then tell it we're gonna\n\n31\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.810\nsend packets, inspect SFR It stands for\nthe Sourcefire, right?\n\n32\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.330\nThat's what they call it here, the\nSourcefire module, and then we have to put\n\n33\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.380\nthat in a container, and I'm just gonna\nput that in the global policy, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.450\nSo we talked about that already.\n\n35\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420\nLet's make this as simple as possible.\n\n36\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950\nNow, if you went to the other FirePOWER\nclass that we had done a few months ago\n\n37\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.470\nRemember we just went into Firepower,\n\n38\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.030\nand we didn't really talk\nabout the ASA at all.\n\n39\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.040\nSo I didn't even show this.\n\n40\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.650\nSo this class is worth twice the price,\n\n41\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.950\neven at twice the price,\nas far as I'm concerned.\n\n42\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.520\nRight?\nSo\n\n43\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.840\nlet's go ahead and\nlet's run down here and take a look.\n\n44\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680\nLet's create a class map and\nput it into our global policy and\n\n45\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360\nthen it's gonna show us that we're pushing\npackets to the source fire module, and\n\n46\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.770\nonce we get the source fire module\nconfigured we'll come back, and\n\n47\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.170\nsee that packets are going in, and that's\npretty much the only thing we have to do\n\n48\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310\non the ASA once we have the Sourcefire\nmodule for the Sourcefire module.\n\n49\n00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.620\nThe rest is done as we'll\nsee through something called\n\n50\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.050\nFireside Management Center.\n\n51\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.850\nLet's go ahead and\nworking right away on this.\n\n52\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.490\nSo the first thing I'm on my ASA here.\n\n53\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.060\nOkay, Config T class map SFR, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.420\nSo I'm making a clasp,\nI didn't have to name it SFR, but\n\n55\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.160\nI did, because it's for the source\nfire module, and in this case here,\n\n56\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.170\nunder this class map,\nI\"m going to say match any, okay?\n\n57\n00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.270\nSo we've got the class map, SFR,\nthat's telling us fwhat it's for\n\n58\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.120\nadministratively, but\n\n59\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.570\nit doesn't do anything until we put\nit into our global policy, does it?\n\n60\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.240\nSo I'm gonna say policy map global.\n\n61\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.560\nThe words underscore policy.\n\n62\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.270\nIf you were to put a dash policy\nyou actually make it a new policy.\n\n63\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.450\nSo be very careful here.\n\n64\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.710\nPeople do that all the time.\n\n65\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.410\nNow I'm gonna tell it that underneath\nhere, My Sourcefire class map here.\n\n66\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.240\nThere's a couple things we can do.\n\n67\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.120\nLet's take a look.\n\n68\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.280\nWell, it's not letting\nme do the question mark.\n\n69\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.680\nThis is why.\n\n70\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.500\nClass sfr.\n\n71\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.650\nSo I'm gonna add that class map in here.\n\n72\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.540\nSo now that's in here and\n\n73\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.945\nwhatever we're inspecting with\nthe class is now in the container.\n\n74\n00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:30.520\n[INAUDIBLE] We've discussed many times.\n\n75\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.000\nNow under here,\nI'm gonna do sfr question mark, and\n\n76\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.030\nwe can see that there's actually three\noptions here, they're only showing us two,\n\n77\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.700\nand this has to do with if our\nSourcefire module stops working.\n\n78\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.680\nIn this case here our Sourcefire\nmodule is a software module.\n\n79\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.820\nIn the 5500-X.\n\n80\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.210\nWhen we get to the 5585,\nit comes hardware modules and up,\n\n81\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.670\nand then we have the appliances and so on.\n\n82\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.490\nNow, they still have these same commands,\nthey're just being a little bit different.\n\n83\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.960\nIf I said fail open, that means if I'm\nsending packets, and the source farm\n\n84\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.230\nmodule is not responding, I'm just going\nto keep sending packets unexpected.\n\n85\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.850\nSo this is something you\nhave to decide right away.\n\n86\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.420\nDo I want to send things, and\nnot bring my network down when SourceFire\n\n87\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.260\nstarts working, and send traffic\nthrough my network unexpected, or\n\n88\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.310\nI'm gonna say fail close and say uh-huh.\n\n89\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.210\nIf Sourcefire can't inspect it,\n\n90\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.530\nthen I'm just gonna drop all traffic\nuntil Sourcefire can inspect it.\n\n91\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.120\nSo really that's a decision\nyou'll have to make.\n\n92\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.620\nI'm gonna say fail open and\nI'm gonna send through uninspected.\n\n93\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.720\nThe other one is monitor only mode, and\n\n94\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.820\nwe really typically don't\nwant to do that too much.\n\n95\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.320\nBasically you're wasting your\nmoney because all it's doing is\n\n96\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.480\ntelling you about all the stuff it was\ngonna drop but wouldn't drop anything.\n\n97\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.090\nIt's really for demonstration purposes.\n\n98\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.500\n>> In this, the old difference\nbetween an IDS and an IPS, right.\n\n99\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.060\nSo you're basically making a detection\nsystem but it can't actually do anything\n\n100\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.130\nabout it versus being a prevention\nsystem which is what you're paying for.\n\n101\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.560\n>> Yeah and\nthat's what you're going to lose and\n\n102\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.020\nso\n>> You know Cisco in their documentation,\n\n103\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.530\nand their courses and stuff are like,\nMonitor for only demonstration only, but\n\n104\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.740\nI have some customers that do it and\nthey keep an eye on their watch,\n\n105\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.750\nand everything that says it's being\ndropped but it's not, and they say,\n\n106\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.050\nwe're never gonna take it\nout of the monitor mode.\n\n107\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.410\nBecause if you take it\nout of monitor mode and\n\n108\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.940\nyou don't tune your IPS policies as\nwe see Then your phone's gonna ring.\n\n109\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.300\nThat's just the way it's gonna go\nuntil you tune your IPS policies.\n\n110\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.000\nAll right.\nSo now we've got this done.\n\n111\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.570\nI'm pretty almost done here,\nbut we've got a module.\n\n112\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.160\nLet's do a show module, and let's see if\nwe got our Sourcefire module in there.\n\n113\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.180\nThink I reinstalled it again last night.\n\n114\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.850\nThere is,\n\n115\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.940\nyou know one of the caveats I never really\ncomplain about Sourcefire like I do,\n\n116\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.600\nyou know, I don't find annoying features\nlike I do with just Cisco in general, but\n\n117\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.890\nthe fact is, is Source Fire is great,\nbthere's no, on any of their products like\n\n118\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.430\nreset to factory defaults, or\nerase start reload, that doesn't exist.\n\n119\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.650\nAo the thing is for\nme to get back factory defaults,\n\n120\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.690\nif I had a class, which I did last week in\nNew York, then I had to come im here and\n\n121\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.040\nlast night I had to actually\nreinstall the system file.\n\n122\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.050\nRight?\nSo that's the way it goes right now.\n\n123\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.970\nSo that being said So I'm going to\ntype exit here, and I'm going to say.\n\n124\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.660\nWhat am I saying?\n\n125\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.510\nSorry.\n\n126\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.240\nSFR consult.\n\n127\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.470\nThere we go, and\nwe're going to come up, and\n\n128\n00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.940\nnotice the word in 3D\nhere if you can see that.\n\n129\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.730\nHey, this has been around for a while, and\n\n130\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.310\nI don't know if they are going\nto change that in the new 6 0.\n\n131\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.460\nYou know, whatever is coming up Vmods but\nthis is what you always saw.\n\n132\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.100\nThey called in their 3D appliances or\n\n133\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.560\nsensors and\nwe still have that name in here.\n\n134\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.750\nNow, I want you guys to understand that\nonce I install this system file again,\n\n135\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.340\nthis is how you would\nget the ASA from Cisco.\n\n136\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.780\nYou take it out of the box and\ndon't forget in your box is a pack.\n\n137\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.300\nIt's a paper pack.\n\n138\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.310\nDo you not forget that, you need that\nwhen you go to cisco.com licenses.\n\n139\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.750\nSo I'm going to session in here, and then\nwe're going to go ahead and configure it.\n\n140\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.770\nNow, remember, this is,\nas I mentioned, sfr console.\n\n141\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.990\nThe full word console, it said con, and\nit's going to come up and it asked me for\n\n142\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.020\nmy admin password and\nI had already done it, obviously, and\n\n143\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.340\nthe first time when you log in a new\nASA out of the box, it's admin, and\n\n144\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.030\nthen the password is\nSourcefire with a capital S.\n\n145\n00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.380\nWill that be changing?\n\n146\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.495\nI'm not the one to know.\n\n147\n00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:08.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n148\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.620\nLogin number.\n\n149\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.000\nOkay, admin.\n\n150\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.110\nLet's start this again, and Sourcefire.\n\n151\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.606\nThere we go.\n\n152\n00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:19.450\n[LAUGH]\n[LAUGH] Give it a second.\n\n153\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.290\nThe first thing that comes\nup with a 5,000 page EULA.\n\n154\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.440\nI thought Microsoft was bad but\nthis one's pretty bad.\n\n155\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.220\nI'm gonna hit the Q key to end this and\npress Enter, and I put in a new password.\n\n156\n00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:36.430\nOkay, do I wanna configure IPv4?\n\n157\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.546\nSo okay, there's two configurations,\nand the first one you didn't see, but\n\n158\n00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:44.542\nthey will see it if they go back to our\nother SourceFIRE installation module in\n\n159\n00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:48.596\nthe other course, but in this one here\nagain you're just pulling the ASA out of\n\n160\n00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:51.177\nthe box,\nit came with the SourceFIRE module, and\n\n161\n00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:53.718\nnow we're just going into it for\nthe first time.\n\n162\n00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:58.498\nSo it already has some configuration on\nit that happened in the installation.\n\n163\n00:07:58.498 --> 00:08:01.498\nThat being said, I'm going to configure\nit with a management IP address.\n\n164\n00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:03.518\nAnd I do it manually.\n\n165\n00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:06.038\nI'll make that a little smaller.\n\n166\n00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:11.769\n192, 160, 68.\n\n167\n00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:13.487\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n168\n00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:16.495\nYeah, it doesn't like\nthe backspace by the way.\n\n169\n00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:20.679\n10.11.10.10, all right,\npretty sure that's right.\n\n170\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.250\nAnd that's my mask, and\n10.11.10.1 is my default gateway.\n\n171\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.070\nNow, I'm not making these numbers up,\nguys.\n\n172\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.566\nThis is my network, this was my design.\n\n173\n00:08:31.566 --> 00:08:40.330\nOkay, and sfgtc.local is my\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n174\n00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.890\n[COUGH] And\n\n175\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.437\nDNS servers, I do have one, 10.11.11.250.\n\n176\n00:08:51.437 --> 00:08:56.524\nAnd I'm gonna say I don't want any here.\n\n177\n00:08:56.524 --> 00:09:00.471\nOkay and\nit's saying it if that's what you want.\n\n178\n00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:03.185\nI could've put a search domain in there,\nbut that's fine.\n\n179\n00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:08.167\nNow, this being said, when you create\nyour proxy for the first time,\n\n180\n00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:12.080\nit has to have an access\ncontrol policy on there.\n\n181\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.480\nSo we have many different policies that\nwe're gonna talk about here in a minute.\n\n182\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.670\nWe have the file policy, IPS store policy,\nyour access control policy, network\n\n183\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:26.180\ndiscovery policy, correlation policies,\nnetwork analysis policy, I can go on.\n\n184\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.950\nThe one thing is you don't\nhave to have any of those, but\n\n185\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.510\nyou do have to have\nan access control policy.\n\n186\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:36.380\nAnd as it is, an access control policy\nis just what they're putting on here,\n\n187\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.680\nit's just kind of like\nan access list at the end.\n\n188\n00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.100\nIt's basically a default allow all\ntraffic, so it's not doing anything.\n\n189\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.340\nIt's pushing everything through\nthe firePOWER module right now.\n\n190\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.480\nAnd we're gonna keep track of it.\n\n191\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.940\nWe're gonna see the traffic coming though.\n\n192\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.760\nBut it's not denying anything or\nblocking anything.\n\n193\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.980\nThis actually takes a couple\nminutes to go through.\n\n194\n00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.350\nSo while that's doing that, what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna open up and go to,\n\n195\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.460\nI'm gonna open up my browser over here.\n\n196\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.150\nAnd I'm gonna go to my FireSIGHT\nManagement Center that's gonna manage this\n\n197\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.080\ndevice.\n\n198\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.610\nSo we're not quite done with the ASA.\n\n199\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.140\nThere's very little configuration\non the Sourcefire module itself.\n\n200\n00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.961\nWe configure it to go into a manager, and\n\n201\n00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.222\nthen we just do everything\nfrom that management.\n\n202\n00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:19.219\nThe only reason I ever go back to the ASAs\nis if I'm not getting any events and\n\n203\n00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.487\nthen I wanna go ahead and\n\n204\n00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:24.308\nlook at my service policy to see if\npackets are going in and out, right?\n\n205\n00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:28.145\n10.11.10.15, that's my fireSIGHT\nManagement Center that I configured.\n\n206\n00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:32.040\nAnd again,\nthis is gonna be changing relatively soon.\n\n207\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.900\nAnd so, we've got a new management\nthat does the ASA config and\n\n208\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.340\nthe FireSIGHT configuration together.\n\n209\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.622\nAnd basically, this is gonna stop us from\nhaving duplicate, we can have web ACLs,\n\n210\n00:10:45.622 --> 00:10:47.280\nfor example.\n\n211\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.590\nAnd the fact is, well,\nwe've got a URL filter here, right?\n\n212\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.000\nSo some of the stuff that we already\ndo in the ASA we do from here, but\n\n213\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.220\nso we're going to create a policy and it's\ngonna be implemented both in the ASA and\n\n214\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.090\nin the firePOWER module.\n\n215\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.700\nSo we'll see that.\n\n216\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.670\nBut right now, we don't have that.\n\n217\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.604\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and log in here,\n\n218\n00:11:04.604 --> 00:11:06.971\nwhile that FirePOWER\nmodule is finishing up.\n\n219\n00:11:11.512 --> 00:11:13.478\nOkay, I think it's working, yeah.\n\n220\n00:11:13.478 --> 00:11:17.150\nSo we can see in here this is\nthe fireSIGHT Management Console.\n\n221\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.426\nSo we haven't seen any of this,\nso we can see there's no data,\n\n222\n00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:21.710\ncuz there's no devices.\n\n223\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.080\nThey call them manage devices,\nnot too long ago they called the sensors,\n\n224\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.730\nwhich kind of made sense to me.\n\n225\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.290\nBut now they're managed devices now.\n\n226\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.900\nAnd the reason is these\ncan be run anywhere.\n\n227\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.700\nSo not just on an ASA, but\non like a Meraki wireless controller,\n\n228\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.610\nor I'm sorry it's not a controller,\n\n229\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.390\nit's their firewall,\ntheir ASA-competitor-type device,\n\n230\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.720\nso you can run the FirePOWER in there,\nbut also on their ISR routers.\n\n231\n00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.570\nSo on their new ISR routers,\nthe newest one.\n\n232\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.055\nSo if you already have an ISR router,\nno, you have to buy a new one.\n\n233\n00:11:57.055 --> 00:12:00.740\n[LAUGH] But nonetheless, it's just a\nmodule that you put in one of those slots,\n\n234\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.380\nand now you run on firePOWER\non your ISR routers.\n\n235\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.050\nSo pretty much in every device, this is\nkinda why I probably got into FirePOWER so\n\n236\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.770\nmuch is because the FirePOWER product line\n\n237\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.120\nis gonna be pretty much seen on\nthe Cisco's entire product line.\n\n238\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.000\nSo, it is a phenomenal product.\n\n239\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.540\nI'm gonna stand out here and\nsay how great it is, it absolutely is.\n\n240\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.850\nAnd it deserves to be out on everything.\n\n241\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.830\nAnd it's so cool that Cisco was able\nto take what Sourcefire had built and\n\n242\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.790\nput into their product line,\nfirst with their ASA,\n\n243\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:36.750\nwhich obviously changed the life\nof that ASA from what it was.\n\n244\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.470\n>> And it's really pretty\nsignificant if you think about it,\n\n245\n00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.780\nthat you're basically running\na Linux server on top of your ASA.\n\n246\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.330\nAnd that's why we had to\ndo that class map earlier.\n\n247\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.640\nThe policy was,\nnormally the firewall receives traffic,\n\n248\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.030\nfilters it, passes the traffic.\n\n249\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.990\nHere we've got to receive the traffic,\nsend it to Sourcefire,\n\n250\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.680\nget it back, filter and pass it.\n\n251\n00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.790\nSo it's really an impressive feat that\nthey're pulling off inside of what,\n\n252\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.900\nin some cases,\nis pretty inexpensive hardware.\n\n253\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.200\n>> It truly is, 5506s were only\na few hundred bucks that I got\n\n254\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.518\nI don't know three, four, five,\nsix-hundred bucks, whatever they were.\n\n255\n00:13:09.518 --> 00:13:11.890\nAnd the SourceFire module,\nthat included that, but\n\n256\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.900\nthat's not where the cost comes in,\ndoes it, Don?\n\n257\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.770\n>> It's the licensing.\n\n258\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.780\n>> [LAUGH] On that term license, which by\nthe way my licenses are almost up, and\n\n259\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.388\nit's $1,000 a year per device, right?\n\n260\n00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:26.190\nSo, there is some discounts you can get\nfrom that, but it's not inexpensive.\n\n261\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.780\nOkay, let's go see if\nour module is working.\n\n262\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.310\nSo, we're going to go down,\nand here it is down here.\n\n263\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.980\nLet's see where we're at.\n\n264\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.038\nWe're looking good here, guys.\n\n265\n00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:39.850\nAll right, so basically I'm in here and so\n\n266\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.135\nthis is my Sourcefire module,\nand this is kind of what you get.\n\n267\n00:13:43.135 --> 00:13:49.110\nThere's not a lot of commands that you're\ngonna run from here for diagnostics.\n\n268\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.010\nJust a couple that I would run.\n\n269\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.715\nOne of the things is,\nif I'm not connecting to my\n\n270\n00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:59.250\nfireSIGHT management center, I'm gonna\ncome in here and check my network.\n\n271\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.600\nI don't know if you saw how slow it was\nto bring just that one command up, but\n\n272\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.750\nI can see my IP address.\n\n273\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.080\nThat's good.\nThe other thing is show managers too.\n\n274\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.100\nAnd basically it's gonna say\nwho my defense center is or\n\n275\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.030\nthey call fireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n276\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.219\nSo I think that term might be\nchanging here shortly as well again.\n\n277\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.442\nSo, no manager is configured.\n\n278\n00:14:17.442 --> 00:14:22.881\nSo I'm gonna say, configure manager add,\n\n279\n00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:27.151\nyes, 10.11.10.15.\n\n280\n00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:30.920\nThat's my FMC that I configured,\nmy fireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n281\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.760\nAnd then I have to put a password,\nand I'll just name it cisco, and\n\n282\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.140\nit'll show up here if I set\nshow manager it'll show up.\n\n283\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.250\nThen when it's registered it doesn't\nshow up what the password is anymore.\n\n284\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.080\nSo as this is registering in here saying,\nI'm gonna take this managed device and\n\n285\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.940\nbring this in.\n\n286\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.080\nNow, how many can I bring in here?\n\n287\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.160\nIt depends on your license on which\nproduct that you bought, right?\n\n288\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.850\nSo I'm going to come back here to\nmy fireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n289\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.940\nAnd I'm gonna say, up here, Devices.\n\n290\n00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.890\nAnd I'm gonna click on Devices, and\nthere's not gonna be any devices in here.\n\n291\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:03.850\nAnd I can add it.\n\n292\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.990\nWell, it's being added\non the managed device.\n\n293\n00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.590\nRight?\n\n294\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.096\nSo not a problem.\n\n295\n00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:13.112\nI'll come over here,\nlet's go over here to Add Device,\n\n296\n00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:17.303\nand that device was 10.11.10.10.\n\n297\n00:15:17.303 --> 00:15:20.070\nYou can see I already had\nconfigured it in there before.\n\n298\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.090\nPassword is Cisco.\n\n299\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.710\nNo group.\n\n300\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:28.510\nBut I have to have the access control\npolicy, cuz if I leave that alone and\n\n301\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.111\nI come in and I try to do it.\n\n302\n00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:32.990\nGo ahead and try to register it, it won't.\n\n303\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.420\nFirst thing you need is\nyour protect license.\n\n304\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.650\nThat's your fireSIGHT license.\n\n305\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.200\nProtect and control, then,\n\n306\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.140\nis your fireSIGHT and IPS, and\nthose actually come with the box.\n\n307\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.120\nIf you just bought it with\nthe regular fireSIGHT IPS,\n\n308\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.030\nthen this is all you would have.\n\n309\n00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.560\nSo obviously there's malware and\nURL filtering,\n\n310\n00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.450\nand these are extra add ons, right.\n\n311\n00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.058\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose all those.\n\n312\n00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:58.888\nNotice I can't register, cuz it says\nAccess Control Policy is required.\n\n313\n00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:03.228\nNow, I could've gone to my FMC,\nthe fireSIGHT Management Center.\n\n314\n00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:06.829\nAnd configured the policy ahead of time,\nand then when I've added the device,\n\n315\n00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:08.820\nclicked it here and pushed that in.\n\n316\n00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.530\nNotice there's some default\nones that I can choose.\n\n317\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.180\nAnd I'm just gonna do\nthe default access control.\n\n318\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.660\nNow under the Advanced tab, if we're\nbehind a NAT device we put our NAT ID.\n\n319\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.050\nAnd then here's this transfer packet.\n\n320\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.550\nSo this is something you might wanna\nconsider, I do wanna send packets.\n\n321\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.430\nNow just since the payload doesn't\nsend the headers or anything, so\n\n322\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.450\nwe're getting all the payloads\nof the files, and\n\n323\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.610\nthe reason that we wanna do something like\nthis is so that we can analyze them later.\n\n324\n00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.700\nSo if we think it's malware,\nwe can send it to our own private sandbox,\n\n325\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.050\nwe can send it out to Cisco's sandbox, to\ntheir Talos cloud for dynamic analysis cuz\n\n326\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.460\nwhen we're sending something out to the\ncloud, we're just sending the hash, right?\n\n327\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.930\nSo the show 256, and it's analyzing that.\n\n328\n00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.280\nIn this case here, I can get the whole\nfile and then send that out for dynamic\n\n329\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.320\nanalysis, which could take, I don't know,\n15 or 20 minutes or something like that.\n\n330\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.590\nSo that's why I store files, so\nI can play with them later, right?\n\n331\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.160\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n332\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.160\nIt's probably done on the other side.\n\n333\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.800\nI haven't looked yet, but I'm gonna go\nhere, and then let's go out here, and\n\n334\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.670\ntake a quick look here.\n\n335\n00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.290\nIt says manager, so show manager.\n\n336\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:13.890\nAnd show managers, and this will probably\ntell us it's pending, in this case here.\n\n337\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.885\nYeah, so we're pending.\n\n338\n00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:18.550\nWe can see our password for now.\n\n339\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.030\nAs soon as the registration comes up\nwhich will be just in a second or\n\n340\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.140\ntwo when you can see that we're gonna\nconnect to this fire site management\n\n341\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.300\ncenter in that we're pending.\n\n342\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.180\nI'll just type this in a couple times.\n\n343\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.744\nIt'll actually show up here\nbefore it'll show in the FMC.\n\n344\n00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:37.040\nStill pending, but\nwe're pretty darn close.\n\n345\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.190\nSo this is coming here.\n\n346\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.000\nSo while this is showing,\nlet's go through something on the top now.\n\n347\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.350\nI know that this is grayed out, but\n\n348\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.480\nI'm not gonna waste any time here while\nthis is working in the background.\n\n349\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.560\nWhy is this going so slow?\n\n350\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.150\nI have the slowest ASA in the world.\n\n351\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.790\nWell, that's not true.\n\n352\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.599\nThe slowest ASA x series in the world,\nthere's definitely slower ASA's,\n\n353\n00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:57.480\nthe 5055 or something.\n\n354\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.920\nBut the fact is that I\ndon't have a fast ASA, so\n\n355\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.990\ndon't expect a lot of things\nto get done really fast.\n\n356\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.300\nI also don't have fast fence sitter.\n\n357\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.390\nI'm using a virtual defense center.\n\n358\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.360\nSo, if you want things faster\nthen buy faster boxes.\n\n359\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.970\nJust add an extra zero,\nyou can get whatever you want.\n\n360\n00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.050\nSo the fact is, is people like well,\nmy ASA, it's overloaded.\n\n361\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.406\nWell, buy another model.\n\n362\n00:18:18.406 --> 00:18:21.817\nSo let's say you were running a 5525,\nand you're saying I want it.\n\n363\n00:18:21.817 --> 00:18:26.308\nAnd that was portion in the data that you\nneeded, and it was at it's maximum, and\n\n364\n00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:30.006\nyou're gonna say, well,\nI want to add the IPS, the malware, and\n\n365\n00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:33.994\nyou are filtering application\nvisibility and control, and what not.\n\n366\n00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:36.020\nThey're gonna say go\nup a couple of models.\n\n367\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.680\nYou'll even go to a 5545 or a 5555 even.\n\n368\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.820\nSo, keep that in mind that whatever\nthey recommend go up a couple of models.\n\n369\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.710\nSo for example,\nI have a two user virtual defense center.\n\n370\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.360\nIt's relatively slow.\n\n371\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.240\nIf I used both of those and they had a lot\nof data coming into them, my network would\n\n372\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.330\ngo slower because everything has to\ncome back to that defense center.\n\n373\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.130\nTo be analyzed and for us to see.\n\n374\n00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.790\nSo I would probably wanna\nget a faster defense center.\n\n375\n00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.460\nAnd let's say that I had 25 devices which\nyou can do on a virtual defense center and\n\n376\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.410\nlicense that.\n\n377\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.590\nI wouldn't put more than 10 or 12 on that.\n\n378\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.520\nBecause you're trying to look\nat correlation of events,\n\n379\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.470\nyou got a lot of events coming in there.\n\n380\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.600\nWhen you get something like that,\n\n381\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.910\nthat's when you start looking\nat a hardware defense center.\n\n382\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.970\nSo a hardware base, so\nwe can get everything faster,\n\n383\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.260\nhardware sensor, stuff like that.\n\n384\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:26.840\nASA isn't for\n\n385\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.180\neveryone in the sense with the fire power,\nmost of my customers, yes, absolutely.\n\n386\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.000\nDo I know some people have taken a route\nand put it in the hardware centers,\n\n387\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.310\nhardware appliances, sure,\n\n388\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.825\nabsolutely, pay as you get,\nyou know a hundred times quadruplet.\n\n389\n00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:42.655\nSo but\nthe ASA will fit in most environments.\n\n390\n00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:45.307\nAnd they did that new ASA,\nwhat is it, the 90300?\n\n391\n00:19:45.307 --> 00:19:46.888\nI can't remember what\nit was called actually.\n\n392\n00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:51.649\nAnd that's coming out, and that's gonna\nbe twice as powerful as the 5585.\n\n393\n00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:56.248\nSo we can see that the still added device\nonly because of the model number and\n\n394\n00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:58.738\nthe virtual defense center that I have.\n\n395\n00:19:58.738 --> 00:20:01.388\nOther than that, if I had the one\npuddle up on each of those,\n\n396\n00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:02.930\nwe'd have been long done.\n\n397\n00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.700\nNow, that being said,\nlet's come up here and take a look.\n\n398\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.090\nSo I have my devices.\n\n399\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:12.890\nThis is, like, what I use on a day\nto day environment administration.\n\n400\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.210\nI have my overview and analysis.\n\n401\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.350\nThis is going to be where I hang out.\n\n402\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.300\nOnce I get everything configured and\nmy policies pushed out, I'm gonna\n\n403\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.940\nhang out here with the overview analysis,\nand I'm gonna be looking at things.\n\n404\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.620\nNow, the other thing under analysis and we\ncan't see that from here, but I'm gonna be\n\n405\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.490\nlooking at things like IPS events and\nconnection events and malware events.\n\n406\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.930\nSo we'll take a look at that as soon\nas this finishes [LAUGH] cooking.\n\n407\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.250\nIt's still going, it's efforting,\nI'll give it that.\n\n408\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.940\nI will give it an A plus for effort.\n\n409\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.640\nSo the fact is, is that we want to\nunderstand the menus on the left,\n\n410\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.120\nand they're pull-down, we can see any\nconnectedness, cuz we can say, hey,\n\n411\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.290\nanytime someone connects and\ncomes through here.\n\n412\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.800\nYou can send me events, so\nthis can get a lot of events,\n\n413\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.330\nand we'll take a look at that and\nmanaging that.\n\n414\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.990\nOkay, and then we also have our different\npolicies we're gonna look at and\n\n415\n00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.100\nwe can compare them.\n\n416\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.990\nNow if I come over here on the right,\nand say there we go, look.\n\n417\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.832\nWatched pot never boils or something.\n\n418\n00:21:07.832 --> 00:21:13.750\nSo anyways, so here we are, so we can see\nit didn't work out very well, did it?\n\n419\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.230\nWe can see that,\n\n420\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.230\nhere it is now, we can see that our\nlicenses, out of all my licenses there.\n\n421\n00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.170\nNow remember, I have my licenses\nthere because I installed\n\n422\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.480\nmy license on my defensitor, the licenses\ngo on the defensitor, guys, the FMC.\n\n423\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.900\nOr whatever they're gonna call it now.\n\n424\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.530\nMy point is the licenses go here,\nand when you connect the device,\n\n425\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.850\nthat device is now licensed\nto work through that manager.\n\n426\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.190\nSo I went through here and did the work.\n\n427\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.761\nSo what I wanna do is\nshow you guys over here.\n\n428\n00:21:44.528 --> 00:21:48.446\nWe have our health, and\nthere's our health policy, and\n\n429\n00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:51.340\nsystem policy, and our help and admin.\n\n430\n00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.710\nNow, underneath here,\n\n431\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.630\nI'm gonna show you that when you\ngo under here to license this.\n\n432\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.953\nProbably the first thing I\nrecommend you doing is you get your\n\n433\n00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:01.830\ndefense center up and\nrunning or FMC up and running.\n\n434\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.152\nAnd then license it with all\nthe license that you have.\n\n435\n00:22:04.152 --> 00:22:08.690\nIf you're gonna have 15 managed devices,\nget all 15 licenses in here.\n\n436\n00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:13.110\nSo I can go ahead and take a look at this\nand you can go to cisco.com/licensing and\n\n437\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.940\nlog in.\n\n438\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.040\nAnd you put in that pack that\nyou put in with your box.\n\n439\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.860\nSo it's gonna show me\nwhat I got over here.\n\n440\n00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.130\nSo you can see that I've\ngot protection and control.\n\n441\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.290\nI've got two of each.\n\n442\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.349\nAnd one's in use.\n\n443\n00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.020\nURL filtering malware.\n\n444\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.689\nAnd the VPN is just a screen\nthat from their appliance that,\n\n445\n00:22:33.689 --> 00:22:35.490\nthat does not work on the ASA.\n\n446\n00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.000\nThat's just because their\nappliance supports a VPN license.\n\n447\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.930\nNow fire sight, and let's define that,\nif we haven't defined that already.\n\n448\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.740\nFireSIGHT is a passive technology and\nit's phenomenal.\n\n449\n00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.630\nI love FireSIGHT, because it goes out and\nit finds my network and\n\n450\n00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.010\nit finds the host users, the applications\nand protocols, and puts them in a database\n\n451\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.065\nthat I can go out look at and search on,\nand it'll give me information.\n\n452\n00:23:00.065 --> 00:23:02.045\nFor example, if I get malware,\nit'll tell me who it was.\n\n453\n00:23:02.045 --> 00:23:04.945\nIt will says Bob in sales and\ncubicle this and phone number.\n\n454\n00:23:04.945 --> 00:23:06.805\nThat'll give me the LTAP information.\n\n455\n00:23:06.805 --> 00:23:09.995\nSo FireSIGHT's extremely powerful and\nwe'll see how to configure that.\n\n456\n00:23:09.995 --> 00:23:14.545\nAnd we can also make it an active, we can\nhave active entries in there by using\n\n457\n00:23:14.545 --> 00:23:18.525\nNMAP, and scanning our host and\ngetting active information about our host.\n\n458\n00:23:18.525 --> 00:23:23.533\nBut in the meantime, so we have a 50,000\nuser limit, so it's 50,000 users,\n\n459\n00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:27.410\n50,000 hosts, and you can see we have\n18 hosts that have already showed up\n\n460\n00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.740\ncuz it's out there looking at my network.\n\n461\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.392\nNow that being said, you're like, 50,000?\n\n462\n00:23:31.392 --> 00:23:33.610\nI don't have 50,000 hosts.\n\n463\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.260\nWell, you'd be surprised how fast this\nfills up because the default policy,\n\n464\n00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.490\nas we'll see, is anything on the internet,\nanything on your local network.\n\n465\n00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.630\nIf someone's on your local network and\n\n466\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.910\nthey go talk to the ethernet, it's\ngonna grab information off those hosts,\n\n467\n00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.290\napplications, users, and protocols,\nand put them into that database.\n\n468\n00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.908\nSo we're going to configure that and say,\nI don't wanna hear all about Google.\n\n469\n00:23:54.908 --> 00:23:57.098\n[LAUGH] I don't wanna see\nabout all their servers.\n\n470\n00:23:57.098 --> 00:23:58.378\nI only wanna know about my internals.\n\n471\n00:23:58.378 --> 00:24:00.298\nAnd that's part of\nthe stuff of what we'll do.\n\n472\n00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:03.233\nAll right, in our next section,\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n473\n00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:05.460\nwe're gonna go through some of this.\n\n474\n00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.730\nThis is some of the stuff over here,\nit's kinda hard to see,\n\n475\n00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.140\nbut this is what we configure.\n\n476\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.510\nTypically, I will configure this over\nhere before I even add a manged device.\n\n477\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.540\nI mean, I can and I did, but in this\ncase here, I'm gonna configure this.\n\n478\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.230\nWe're gonna see there's a system policy,\na health policy, and\n\n479\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.360\nthen some other tools that we'll take\na quick look at in our next section\n\n480\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.700\nbefore we get into the policies.\n\n481\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.474\nOkay, so that was how I bring up an ASA,\nI'm sorry, with a FirePOWER module for\n\n482\n00:24:33.474 --> 00:24:38.010\nthe first time, so now I can come\nback here and check this out.\n\n483\n00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.150\nSo I got my show managers down in here.\n\n484\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.350\nNow to get back to your ASA,\n\n485\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.350\nthe keystrokes are kinda\nweird to figure out, right?\n\n486\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.251\nYou're like, how do I get back?\n\n487\n00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:50.480\nYou know, and so now we can see,\nhere's our manager.\n\n488\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.940\nNotice our password's\nnot showing up anymore,\n\n489\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.500\nbut Ctrl+Shift+6 twice,\nand then hit X, right?\n\n490\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.493\nOkay, so infinity 30 is actually coming\nin, but the typing it in doesn't work.\n\n491\n00:25:01.493 --> 00:25:06.815\nIt's really Ctrl+Shift+6,\nlet go, Ctrl+Shift+6 again,\n\n492\n00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:11.215\npress X, and\nthen I could do show policy map, show run.\n\n493\n00:25:13.768 --> 00:25:18.509\nAnd the answer is, I thought, whoops,\nit helps if I put a dash in there.\n\n494\n00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:22.540\nI could type sfr, right,\nbecause that's what we have in there.\n\n495\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.820\nSo, here it is right here.\n\n496\n00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.910\nSo, we're seeing that right here,\nthat here's our fail open.\n\n497\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:34.440\nSo, I can come back to my ASA, and\nI want to show service policy SFR.\n\n498\n00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.820\nSometimes I get it confused with\nthe policy map, but show service policy.\n\n499\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.040\nNow, I can just type in\nshow service policy, but\n\n500\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.948\nin this case here, I'm gonna be specific\nhere, because I'm looking for information.\n\n501\n00:25:42.948 --> 00:25:45.928\nNotice this service policy\nis my global policy.\n\n502\n00:25:45.928 --> 00:25:50.297\nAnd the class map that tells us what\nwe're inspecting is the sfr class map.\n\n503\n00:25:50.297 --> 00:25:53.450\nNow, we actually are seeing\npackets output here.\n\n504\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.740\nSo as, you know,\nwe really haven't sent any data.\n\n505\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.180\nIt's not even configured, right?\n\n506\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.772\nSo, when it's configured and you're like,\nwell, I'm not getting any packets,\n\n507\n00:26:01.772 --> 00:26:03.335\nI'm not getting analysis.\n\n508\n00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:04.869\nSo we're gonna come in here and\n\n509\n00:26:04.869 --> 00:26:08.713\nmake sure that packets are being sent\nfrom my service policy up to my modules.\n\n510\n00:26:08.713 --> 00:26:10.253\nSo this is a very important command.\n\n511\n00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:12.413\nSo, that's how you would do it.\n\n512\n00:26:12.413 --> 00:26:15.819\nYou would set that up, you create your\nclass map, put it in your, you know,\n\n513\n00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:18.639\nin this case, I just used my\nglobal policy, makes it easy, and\n\n514\n00:26:18.639 --> 00:26:22.046\nthen my service policy is global in\nall interfaces, so I didn't even have,\n\n515\n00:26:22.046 --> 00:26:25.187\nyou don't have much work to do in there,\nbut this is the most important\n\n516\n00:26:25.187 --> 00:26:28.790\ntroubleshooting command that I use on\nthe ASA when I have the FirePOWER module.\n\n517\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.820\nIf I'm not seeing anything,\nI come here and check my service policy.\n\n518\n00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.485\n>> You make it seem all so easy, Todd.\n\n519\n00:26:33.485 --> 00:26:38.070\nNow, one thing that Todd mentioned way\nback in the beginning of the episode was,\n\n520\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.915\nin his case, he had a nice sfr,\nor Sourcefire, FirePOWER module,\n\n521\n00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:43.881\nthat was not configured, right?\n\n522\n00:26:43.881 --> 00:26:46.490\nThat was basically ready to go\nin a factory default state.\n\n523\n00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.240\nBut if you're not in\na factory default state,\n\n524\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.080\nyou may indeed have to reinstall the\nsystem image to get it put back that way.\n\n525\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.540\nAnd, it takes a long time.\n\n526\n00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.630\nIt's why we didn't do it during the show.\n\n527\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.380\nIf you wanna see that process,\nbe sure to check out our FirePOWER series.\n\n528\n00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.690\nWe actually have a series dedicated\njust for FirePOWER, and Todd runs\n\n529\n00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.960\nthrough the whole process in there,\nit's definitely something worth watching.\n\n530\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.930\nAll right, but, as far as this\nepisode goes, he's configured it.\n\n531\n00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.250\nHe's got it turned on, traffic is being\nsent to the source of our module, but\n\n532\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.530\nwe haven't really customized\nit hardly at all, right?\n\n533\n00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.960\nSo we need to jump in there and see\nsome of the cool bells and whistles, and\n\n534\n00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.760\nthat's exactly what we're gonna do.\n\n535\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.160\nBut we're out of time on this episode, so\nit's gonna have to wait for the next one.\n\n536\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.960\nStay tuned,\nbecause we've got more Sourcefire action,\n\n537\n00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.600\nmore FirePOWER action\ncoming up after this.\n\n538\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.260\nBut for right now, signing off for\nITPro.TV, I'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n539\n00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.927\n>> Todd Lammle.\n\n540\n00:27:31.927 --> 00:27:33.508\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:19.620\nAnd welcome back to another episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Tom Pazette.\n\n4\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.430\nBack again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n5\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.978\nIn our last episode, we got our\nfirst kind of taste of firePOWER.\n\n6\n00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:32.766\nWe got a chance to see how to get into\nthat UI, how to basically launch it,\n\n7\n00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.320\njust really, really basic,\n\n8\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.766\nget the initial configuration\nwhere we could access the system.\n\n9\n00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.658\nBut we didn't really get\nto do anything with it, and\n\n10\n00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.690\nthat's what we're gonna pick\nup here in this episode.\n\n11\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.200\nBecause if we want this thing to work,\n\n12\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.330\nthere's some policies that we've gotta\ndefine, that we've gotta put in place.\n\n13\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.903\nAnd it starts to showcase some of the real\npower of having the Cisco firePOWER\n\n14\n00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:53.554\nservices inside your ASA.\n\n15\n00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.846\nAnd back in the studio with me\nto help with this, we've got Mr.\n\n16\n00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.937\nTodd Lammle who's going to\nwalk us through the process.\n\n17\n00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:58.611\nTodd, take it away.\n\n18\n00:00:58.611 --> 00:00:59.307\n>> We're gonna keep going.\n\n19\n00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:03.582\nYeah, we were just out looking at\nthe service policy and obviously we're not\n\n20\n00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:07.417\nconfigured yet as we discussed,\nso we're not sending any packets.\n\n21\n00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.030\nBut as soon as packets go through the ASA\nin our class mat, which we put into our\n\n22\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.110\ngoal policy, which we applied to our\ninterface with our service policy, right?\n\n23\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.310\nTrying to get you guys focused on this.\n\n24\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.790\nThat we added the SFR,\nand we said fail open,\n\n25\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.000\nor you could've said fail closed and\nwe explained that.\n\n26\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500\nSo, let's go ahead and\njump right into some policies, and\n\n27\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.550\ntalk about what we're gonna do here\nthe rest of the day and tomorrow.\n\n28\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.360\nAnd again, this is in addition to what we\nalready have out there with IPTV Pros.\n\n29\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.470\nSo first off,\n\n30\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.010\nwe have over here what we would call\nour configuration, bring up the FMC.\n\n31\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.510\nI usually do a lot of this before\nI even add a managed device.\n\n32\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.780\nAnd then I can come over here and\ncreate my policy.\n\n33\n00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.520\nI'm gonna look up policies here.\n\n34\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.620\nAnd I can create these policies, again,\nbefore I add a managed device, but\n\n35\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.640\nit doesn't matter.\n\n36\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.000\nBut in this case here,\n\n37\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.750\nthe way that we're gonna do this is we're\ngonna go over here today and do this.\n\n38\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200\nNow, tomorrow when we get back,\nwe're gonna hit the policies and\n\n39\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.040\nwe're gonna start their file policy.\n\n40\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.430\nI know this sounds odd, but\nthis is our file malware policy and\n\n41\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.930\nwe're just gonna wing to configure\nthis and we're going to, for\n\n42\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.230\nexample, if a customer service security\npolicy says block EXEs, you know,\n\n43\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.060\nstuff like that,\nthat's what this policy will do for us.\n\n44\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.210\nVery cool, works very, very well,\nand it's fun to configure.\n\n45\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.120\nI guess probably cuz you're\nblocking users from doing stuff, so\n\n46\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.490\nyou get that I'm all powerful admin guy.\n\n47\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.282\nAnyways, in the IPS policy it's\na little bit more detailed,\n\n48\n00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:36.190\na little bit more time here, maybe not\nas much as we did in the last firePOWER\n\n49\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.890\nsession, but in here, this is where\nwe're configuring Snort, right.\n\n50\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.624\nSo we'll come back in here and tune Snort\nor when we do network analysis I'll\n\n51\n00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:48.070\nshow you how to tune Snort from\nour network analysis screens.\n\n52\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.910\nSo this is basically doing our\nSnort rules, we're enabling and\n\n53\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.970\ndisabling which ones we wanna use,\nfine-tuning the preprocessors and so on.\n\n54\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.020\nAnd our access control policy is\nthe only thing we have to use.\n\n55\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.330\nAnd why do I do this third?\n\n56\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.680\nBecause to enable and\npush out the file and\n\n57\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.350\nIPS policy, they have to be put\ninto an access control policy.\n\n58\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.370\nThen we take that one channel policy and\npush that out to our managed devices.\n\n59\n00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.140\nI can use one access control policy for\nall of my managed devices or\n\n60\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.510\nI could have a separate access control\npolicy for each managed device.\n\n61\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.610\nIt's completely up to you.\n\n62\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.270\nI like to make some generalized ones,\nbut it all depends on their network.\n\n63\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.250\nSo let's go back over here on our, what\nwe wouldn't call our day to day stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.853\nWe're gonna look at our health, of course.\n\n65\n00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:31.710\nLet's start over here.\n\n66\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.260\nAnyways, we have our health monitor,\nHealth Policy, and\n\n67\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.820\nyou really don't have to play\nwith a lot of stuff here.\n\n68\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.910\nBut there might be some stuff you\nwanna turn off, and I'll show you.\n\n69\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.500\nBecause this turns red, and\nmaybe it's annoying, and you're like,\n\n70\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.550\nI don't know if something's wrong and\nit all depends.\n\n71\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.700\nAnd so, some of the stuff that Cisco's\ngoing to fix coming up, but health events,\n\n72\n00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.700\nwe can blacklist some devices, if we take\nthem out, we don't want them monitored.\n\n73\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.820\nSo they stop giving us errors.\n\n74\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.160\nAnd then we can set up some alerts.\n\n75\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.410\nSo let's take a look at,\nwe'll start with health monitor, sure.\n\n76\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.898\nOkay.\nSo first off,\n\n77\n00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:09.660\nwe can see our price our\nAppliance Status Summary is 100%.\n\n78\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.780\nAnd we should be able to see that\nwe have two devices in here.\n\n79\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.190\nHere's my managed device\ncuz I know its IP Address.\n\n80\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.520\nAnd this right here, notice I have\nmy fully qualified domain here.\n\n81\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.950\nThis is my defense center or\nfireSIGHT management center.\n\n82\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.230\nAnd I can click on these.\n\n83\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.489\nAnd most of the time when this turns red,\nby the way,\n\n84\n00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:30.608\nis cuz your time got screwed up or\nsomething.\n\n85\n00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:35.150\nThis thing screams a lot if\nyour time isn't really well.\n\n86\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.220\nSo we're gonna keep a look at this, and\n\n87\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.870\nmake sure that our NTP\nserver's configured correctly.\n\n88\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.680\nCuz that's one of the first things\nthis thing will scream about.\n\n89\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.699\nBut let's click on this, right here.\n\n90\n00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.649\nAnd I'm gonna click on this device here,\nand again I mentioned, we're at 5506, so\n\n91\n00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:53.166\nnothing's gonna happen super-fast here.\n\n92\n00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:57.264\nBut nonetheless, notice I click on this\nmodule, this is my managed device, and\n\n93\n00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:01.304\nI can actually see information, but the\nreason I brought you to this screen here\n\n94\n00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:04.981\nis because if you're having problems\nthen Cisco can look at the health,\n\n95\n00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:06.881\nthey'll tell you to generate this.\n\n96\n00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.182\nNow, I'm not recommending you click\nthis button until they tell you,\n\n97\n00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:13.230\nbecause it is a lot of information,\nit takes a lot of time.\n\n98\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.940\nAnd if I was to push that now,\nour class would be over because\n\n99\n00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.650\nI can't do anything else while\nthis is generating those files.\n\n100\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo, anyways, I probably could come in\nwith another browser from another host,\n\n101\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.030\nbut in this case here,\nI'd be done from here.\n\n102\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.490\nSo I'm gonna cancel this, and again,\n\n103\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.550\na lot of that would take a lot of time\nbecause of the actual ASA that I was on.\n\n104\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.620\nSo that's our health monitor, and\nyou're able to click on this and\n\n105\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.530\nsee what the problems are, and\nit'll tell us what happened and\n\n106\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.400\nwhat was not synchronized or whatnot.\n\n107\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.930\nBut nonetheless,\nlet's look at our health policy.\n\n108\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.850\nAnd we can see there's\ninitial health policy here.\n\n109\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.850\nActually, this isn't even applied, so what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna change this.\n\n110\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.400\nSo really what I wanna do,\nis I want to create a new policy.\n\n111\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.200\nAnd just leave this one as default\nthat I can use at any time.\n\n112\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.638\nSo I'm gonna create a policy for\nmy company.\n\n113\n00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:04.376\nAnd again, remember, you create this, and\n\n114\n00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:07.232\nyou can push this out to all your\nmanaged devices off this defense center.\n\n115\n00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:10.324\nAll right, so\nnotice it's gonna copy the initial.\n\n116\n00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:14.000\nIt says, which one do you want me to copy,\nI'm gonna say the initial health policy.\n\n117\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.162\nView policy name is Todd,\n\n118\n00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:20.760\nit says Todd Health Policy, and\nI can put an optional description there.\n\n119\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.850\nSo now when I change something\nI don't have to worry about\n\n120\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.700\nscrewing up the defaults.\n\n121\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.540\nAll right, not gonna change a lot here,\nbut notice logo in here, and\n\n122\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.680\nlet's take a look, I want to show\nyou some things for right now.\n\n123\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.020\nThey were supposed to\nbe being fixed as well.\n\n124\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.440\nSo, first off, advanced malware,\nyou guys gotta understand,\n\n125\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.510\nthis doesn't turn any service on and off.\n\n126\n00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.510\nAll it does is tell us whether we're gonna\nalerted on whether it's working or not.\n\n127\n00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.280\nIt's a health, right?\n\n128\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.930\nSo we can basically leave this alone,\nlet that go red, and\n\n129\n00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.150\nignore it if that's what\nyou really wanted to do.\n\n130\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.670\nBut the reason we come in here is because\nwe just don't like seeing red stuff\n\n131\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.580\non our screen.\n\n132\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.785\nAll right.\nSo, you have the appliance heartbeat.\n\n133\n00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:02.635\nNow, one of the things that I could do is\ncome over here to Health Monitor Alerts\n\n134\n00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:06.630\nand say, hey, like I don't know,\nthe disk usage is at 90%.\n\n135\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.940\nWell, under Health Monitor Alerts, I can\nhave it email me or send a sys log or\n\n136\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.910\nsomething like that.\n\n137\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.200\nAnd that's what these alerts are for.\n\n138\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.610\nSo we can come over here,\nconfigure something,\n\n139\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.860\ncreate a customized alert over here,\nand put my name and\n\n140\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.450\nhave it email me for example if something\nwas super-critical that I wanted to know.\n\n141\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.569\nWell, let me tell you what I\nchanged right now on here.\n\n142\n00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.047\nThere's not a lot, so basically you\nleave a lot of this stuff alone, and\n\n143\n00:07:31.047 --> 00:07:31.861\njust let it.\n\n144\n00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:38.162\nBut right now, under Interface Status,\nif you have a high-availability system,\n\n145\n00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:43.129\nwhich I know that you would if you\nhad an ASA, you have another ASA,\n\n146\n00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:47.947\nwell, one of those interfaces on\none of those is active and not.\n\n147\n00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:51.250\nSo it's not gonna be sending\ninformation out to interface, so\n\n148\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.316\nthis is actually gonna turn red and\ngive you a red alert because it's not out.\n\n149\n00:07:55.316 --> 00:08:01.340\nSo I could turn this off and\non the device that's on standby.\n\n150\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.780\nAnd obviously we're not going to see\nan alert if something happens here, but\n\n151\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.250\nif the primary goes down I'll\nstill see an alert possibly.\n\n152\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.718\nBut nonetheless, the interface\nhere would stop monitoring, so\n\n153\n00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:15.870\nit'll stop giving us errors\nof high availability.\n\n154\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.860\nSo why am I saying maybe this\nwon't be important in the future?\n\n155\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.080\nIt's supposed to be fixed in\nthe next few months, they said.\n\n156\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.670\nBut I haven't seen it yet.\n\n157\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.350\nSo we'll keep an eye on that.\n\n158\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.890\nSo I'll go through here, for example,\n\n159\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.440\nmaybe I want to monitor my\nFireSIGHT host usage and so on.\n\n160\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.050\nMy time when it gets off [LAUGH] I\ndon't know, whatever you wanna do.\n\n161\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.770\nSo we're gonna go ahead and save that and\nthen we can create alerts for it.\n\n162\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.990\nSo in this case here,\nI'm gonna come down to the bottom,\n\n163\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.380\ngonna make the changes that I want if any,\nand I'm gonna say Save Policy and Exit.\n\n164\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.500\nNow to apply this to a managed device, I'm\ngonna click this green check box, here.\n\n165\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.640\nAll right, and\nit's gonna say who do I apply it to.\n\n166\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.990\nWell, in this case here I'm gonna\napply it to both my managed device and\n\n167\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.760\nmy defense center so they have the same.\n\n168\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.294\nAnd I typically will apply it to all\nmy devices, create one and apply them.\n\n169\n00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo you can see there was nothing in\nhere that would make me wanna create\n\n170\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.960\na bunch of them.\n\n171\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.990\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\npush this one out and let it go, and\n\n172\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.140\nnow it's saying it's gonna\nbe in our task status.\n\n173\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.750\nNow, I can get there through System\n> Monitoring > Task Status and so\n\n174\n00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.080\nI typically spend a lot of time here,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n175\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.920\nBecause when you're updating a policy you\nreally wanna make sure that it came clear.\n\n176\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.180\nI probably have some stuff in here from\nwhat I was doing last week, and I do,\n\n177\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.950\nyou can see this.\n\n178\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.190\nWe can see that I was running,\nall the completed, and this one failed.\n\n179\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.240\nAnd when I show you guys,\nwhen you see this, this sounds really bad,\n\n180\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.070\nit says wrong Snort version.\n\n181\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.869\nMakes you wanna pick up the phone and\ncall Cisco.\n\n182\n00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.370\nHow the heck can I get\na wrong Snort version?\n\n183\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.080\nWell the reason that this error is showing\nup, and by the way, this took me a long\n\n184\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.320\ntime to figure this one out,\ndon't bother calling Cisco about this.\n\n185\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.190\nAnyways, if you don't\nhave an access control,\n\n186\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.106\neverything's not configured, and\nyou don't have an ACP out there yet, and\n\n187\n00:09:54.106 --> 00:09:58.290\nyour FireSIGHT is actually trying to\nupdate but your ACP's not updated.\n\n188\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.010\nIt gives you this weird error.\n\n189\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.170\nSo as soon as I apply an access control\npolicy I'll stop getting this error.\n\n190\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.969\nSo one of the things that I do out here\nis I come here and I remove failed jobs.\n\n191\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.810\nAnd then remove completed jobs.\n\n192\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.045\nAnd I keep an eye on these.\n\n193\n00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:17.780\nAnd the other one's successful so\nmy health policy was updated.\n\n194\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.980\nSo notice now, he's unhappy,\nmy health policy [LAUGH] is unhappy.\n\n195\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.860\nProbably if I go and take a look at\nthe health status, via the health monitor,\n\n196\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.851\nI'm pretty sure that the time is\nprobably gonna say, No, it actually\n\n197\n00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:32.808\ngave me something else but I think it's\ngoing to go ahead and sync back up here.\n\n198\n00:10:32.808 --> 00:10:36.910\nThe synchronization daemon\nterminated unexpectedly one time.\n\n199\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.370\nSo it's only one time so\ngive it some time, it'll probably sync up.\n\n200\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.030\nSo if I check my health policy again,\nit's fine or maybe I have to reapply.\n\n201\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.930\nIt says it's fine, I'm gonna leave that\nfor a bit and we'll come back to it.\n\n202\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.060\nI could look at health events and so\non, but I think that's enough for now.\n\n203\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.300\nWe go into a little bit more of\nhealth policies in the other class.\n\n204\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.320\nIn the system here though, we have\nsome different things, system tools.\n\n205\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.680\nThe scheduling is real, real important.\n\n206\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.082\nWhen I go out to a customer and\nI set stuff up, their schedule is so\n\n207\n00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:08.800\nfull of stuff that's happening in\nthe background automatically, so\n\n208\n00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.712\nthey don't have to do it every day,\nadministration.\n\n209\n00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:14.404\nSo we can set up a lot of\nadministration in the background here.\n\n210\n00:11:14.404 --> 00:11:18.524\nAll right, anyways, system monitoring,\nagain, what I use here,\n\n211\n00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:22.160\nthere's the audit log,\nthis will tell me who changed what.\n\n212\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.427\nSo if I go ahead and\ntake a look at this, I will see that,\n\n213\n00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:28.430\nyou can see that I was out there,\nthe admin.\n\n214\n00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.920\nAnd this is one of\nthe reasons we create users.\n\n215\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.930\nAnd again, in the FirePOWER class we\ngo over users, we won't in this one.\n\n216\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.630\nOf creating users both internally and\nexternally.\n\n217\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.571\nAnd the reason is, is you don't want\nto just have everyone log in as admin.\n\n218\n00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:43.220\nBecause then when they make\na change you won't know who did it.\n\n219\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.180\nYou're like, well,\nthey can come in and delete that.\n\n220\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.600\nTrue, if that have that access.\n\n221\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.920\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsend everything to a syslog right, so\n\n222\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.780\nanything that happens.\n\n223\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.630\nSo in all,\nit will have access to that, right?\n\n224\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.770\nSo, under there we can\nconfigure our licenses.\n\n225\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.820\nAnd then let's talk about updates for\na minute.\n\n226\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.600\nSo we can allow this to\nupdate our system here.\n\n227\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.290\nFirst off, our defense center version,\nwhat it's running, I'm running 5.4 here,\n\n228\n00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.020\nwe'll be running 6 shortly.\n\n229\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.400\nBut these are the downloads, so\nI can say download update again.\n\n230\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.770\nI don't wanna click this right now,\nbut we'll download the latest updates.\n\n231\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.870\nAnd then this is for\nmy defense center updates, right, and\n\n232\n00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.710\nit'll update my ASA and my defense center.\n\n233\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.450\nThis takes awhile, now remember,\n\n234\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.750\nwhen you're doing these updates you\ndownload them and then you click.\n\n235\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.430\nIt looks like this little\npackage is exploding to me,\n\n236\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.965\nbut basically it's just saying\nit's gonna do a package install.\n\n237\n00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:41.540\nBut on this product here,\nit takes at least two hours, right,\n\n238\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.130\nand during that time it's down,\nokay, so remember that.\n\n239\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.077\nSo we need to be careful, now,\nif you have a higher end model,\n\n240\n00:12:48.077 --> 00:12:50.487\nobviously it's not gonna\ntake nearly that long.\n\n241\n00:12:50.487 --> 00:12:51.930\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at rule updates.\n\n242\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:58.090\nAnd what we're talking about\nhere is our IPS Snort rules.\n\n243\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.220\nSo remember that the Talos are very\nsmart people, saying something\n\n244\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.254\ngood about Cisco here, but again,\nthey came from Sourcefire [LAUGH] so.\n\n245\n00:13:06.254 --> 00:13:09.390\n[LAUGH] Anyways, very smart people and\n\n246\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.040\nthey're updating our\nSnort rules constantly.\n\n247\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.240\nAnd this gets updated every couple hours,\nright.\n\n248\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.080\nSo you want to get the updates as much\nas possible because they're looking for\n\n249\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.590\nthe latest attacks and\ncreating rules and pushing them out.\n\n250\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.430\nYou can also find Snort rules from other\nsources as well, the FBI and so on.\n\n251\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.120\nBecause when the FBI sees an attack,\nthey actually create a Snort rule and\n\n252\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.522\npush that out.\n\n253\n00:13:28.522 --> 00:13:31.560\n>> Yeah and this is one of the key\nthings that some people miss.\n\n254\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.754\nIs when they hear that Sourcefire\nis running Snort under the hood,\n\n255\n00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:38.463\nthey're like well, that's an open\nsource packet inspection utility, and\n\n256\n00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:41.620\nI can just go and get that for free,\nwhy would I pay Cisco for that?\n\n257\n00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.500\nAnd the short answer is that yeah,\nSnort is free.\n\n258\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.250\nYou can go and get it, and\nthere's absolutely no value that Cisco is\n\n259\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.190\nbringing by giving you Snort than\nyou go and getting it yourself.\n\n260\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.690\nWhere the value is comes\nin those definitions,\n\n261\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:56.550\ncomes in those signatures that you\ndownload that say here's an attack.\n\n262\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.290\nOr some of it's not even signatures,\nright, it's behavioral\n\n263\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.240\npatterns that we get that say this\nis traffic you need to be blocking.\n\n264\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.034\nAnd while the FBI is putting out data,\nit may or may not be timely.\n\n265\n00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:11.255\nThe Talos guys on the other hand, which\nis Cisco's division that creates these\n\n266\n00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:14.350\nsignatures and definition files,\nthey are very timely.\n\n267\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.620\nIt's what you pay for, right?\n\n268\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.129\nThat's why you wanna have Sourcefire and\n\n269\n00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:20.700\nFirePOWER as opposed to\njust open source Snort.\n\n270\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.240\n>> Yes, and\nwhat he was saying is very important.\n\n271\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.000\nWhat they ended up doing here is they\ntook Snort and that's been been around,\n\n272\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.400\nwas 18 years and before he sold it for\n$3.2 billion and he started-\n\n273\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.310\n>> I didn't know it was that long.\n\n274\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.305\n>> And really, yeah it was a,\nyeah, so a pretty good investment.\n\n275\n00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:38.980\nHe started with text files,\nand I remember, gosh,\n\n276\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.510\n15 years ago people were like yeah,\nthis is the best product ever.\n\n277\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.670\nAnd every time an attach happened\nthey had to create a new text file,\n\n278\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.810\nand then you import\nthe text file into Snort.\n\n279\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.419\nAnd that was fine, it was just\nsomething that I didn't want to do, or\n\n280\n00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:55.420\nmost people didn't want to do.\n\n281\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.893\nSo what happened is when they created\nthis GUI where now we get our events and\n\n282\n00:14:59.893 --> 00:15:01.601\ncan do correlation events.\n\n283\n00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:04.000\nIt changed the security world, right?\n\n284\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.600\nSo we're able to look at events and\ndo retrospective analysis even.\n\n285\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.750\nRight, so this is a huge, huge thing.\n\n286\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.610\nAgain, a lot of people ask me,\nshould I put out FirePOWER?\n\n287\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.620\nI'm looking at Palo Alto, and I'm not\ngonna pick on Palo Alto here but [LAUGH].\n\n288\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.582\nI'm sure they have some fine products,\nthey got Dell,\n\n289\n00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:24.980\nI forgot what they're called,\nDell Works something.\n\n290\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.190\nAnyways, they have some fine products,\nMcAfee has fine products.\n\n291\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.130\nBut what makes this one unique and\nbetter than all the others,\n\n292\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.930\nand I'm truly saying that without being\nan employee or a spokesperson for\n\n293\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.810\nCisco in any way, shape or form.\n\n294\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.770\nIs that we have this one management\ninterface, and we're about\n\n295\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.190\nto get even a better management interface\nthat I'll show you in a few months.\n\n296\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.026\nAnd basically what it does is\ngives us all that correlation and\n\n297\n00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:51.697\nnow we can also transfer\npackets as we saw.\n\n298\n00:15:51.697 --> 00:15:56.348\nWhen we pulled in that device and\ndo more analysis of the packets either by\n\n299\n00:15:56.348 --> 00:16:00.323\nourselves with our own sandboxes,\nor using Cisco and Talos.\n\n300\n00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:03.005\nAll right, so let's go back here.\n\n301\n00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.665\nWe can do a one time.\n\n302\n00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:07.100\nWhat I do is I like to do\nreoccuring rule updates.\n\n303\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.290\nWhen I put that up there, I'm gonna say,\nyou know, and it depends on your network.\n\n304\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.370\nI don't know if you have to\nupdate this all the time right?\n\n305\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.524\nIt depends on you, it says daily 10:00 PM.\n\n306\n00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:20.860\nYou know, that's fine, but\nhere's your problem, and it is.\n\n307\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.719\nIf you do this it doesn't do anything\ntill you reapply your IPS or\n\n308\n00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:26.153\nsnort policy, right.\n\n309\n00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:28.991\nAnd then that doesn't do anything\nagain until you go out and\n\n310\n00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:30.819\nreapply your access control policy.\n\n311\n00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:34.520\nAnd depending on how you configure it,\nit can stop sending traffic through for\n\n312\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.091\nanywhere from a couple minutes,\n\n313\n00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:39.231\nto ten minutes, or longer depending\non which device you have, and\n\n314\n00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:43.120\nhow big your access control policy is, and\nhow many snort rules you have enabled.\n\n315\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.580\nSo, I'm not gonna sit here and say it's\ndown for ten minutes, or one minute, or\n\n316\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.390\nwhatever.\n\n317\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.510\nIt's relative to your network and\nyour appliances, but\n\n318\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.850\nI definitely know that you need\nto pay attention to this, and\n\n319\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.150\nI know it's gonna be a point\nof contention if you don't.\n\n320\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.220\nSo, reapply intrusion, so\n\n321\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.076\nI can say everyday [LAUGH] at 10 PM,\nmaybe I'll say wait till 11.\n\n322\n00:17:03.076 --> 00:17:07.736\n11:30 PM every day,\nhow about 11:55 every day.\n\n323\n00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:11.376\nI'll reapply my IPS policy, and then I'll\nreapply my access control policy, and\n\n324\n00:17:11.376 --> 00:17:14.250\nthat pushes out every snort rule,\nevery day at midnight.\n\n325\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.027\nOkay, all the new snort rules, all right.\n\n326\n00:17:16.027 --> 00:17:16.952\nWe'll say that that's fine.\n\n327\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.079\nNow, there's also something\ncalled geolocation updates.\n\n328\n00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.541\nNow, this comes with the year\nin FireSIGHT license and\n\n329\n00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:27.861\nI think it's FireSIGHT Protect and\nControl right.\n\n330\n00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:32.433\nSo, we get our geolocation updates and\nthese are updated every couple hours, and\n\n331\n00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:36.937\nwe wanna enable these, and the reason that\nwe would do this is because you'll see\n\n332\n00:17:36.937 --> 00:17:39.480\nthat when we get into\naccess control policy.\n\n333\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.230\nLet's say you want to block, I don't know,\nRussia, the Federation of Russia.\n\n334\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.170\nAnd blocking their IP addresses or\nsaying I wanna block India or\n\n335\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.600\nwhatever, that doesn't really do\nyou much good by going out and\n\n336\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.640\nblocking their IP addresses,\ncuz what they do is they figure out.\n\n337\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.435\nHey, you're blocking my IP address, and\nI can no longer get to that site, so\n\n338\n00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:55.819\nI'm just gonna change my IP address.\n\n339\n00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.111\nAnd they're really good at that.\n\n340\n00:17:57.111 --> 00:18:01.512\nAnd so really by doing these objects,\nright, is we'll see we'll create some\n\n341\n00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:04.861\ngeolocation objects right after\nthis in the next section.\n\n342\n00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:08.783\nAnd then updating those objects, you don't\nhave to reapply your access control policy\n\n343\n00:18:08.783 --> 00:18:10.400\ncuz the objects are in there.\n\n344\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.300\nThey're Cisco's updating them for you.\n\n345\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.020\nIt comes with your license.\n\n346\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.630\nUse their service use their\ngeo location updates.\n\n347\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.840\nNo reason you have to go and\nupdate those IP addresses.\n\n348\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.240\nThis is a very cool feature.\n\n349\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.870\n>> Now beware because you've\ngot to renew your license.\n\n350\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.950\nTodd mentioned, it's once a year.\n\n351\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.310\nWhat happens if you don't pay and\nyour subscription ends?\n\n352\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.720\nYou stop getting your updates, and that's\na pretty big problem, isn't it, Todd?\n\n353\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.240\n>> It is and you can buy a 3-year license.\n\n354\n00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.410\nThe problem is that I've seen some expire,\nand they stop doing the updates, and\n\n355\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.590\nyou're not getting this alert.\n\n356\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.770\nNow when you go to some screens,\nit does say that your license has expired,\n\n357\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.160\nbut by default if you're not looking\nat the product, you're not gonna know.\n\n358\n00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.570\nIt's just gonna stop doing those updates.\n\n359\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.280\nAnyways, so we're gonna pay attention\nto that and again he did mention I buy\n\n360\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.226\nthe one year license, and you know item\nby the three year license so, anyways.\n\n361\n00:18:58.226 --> 00:19:00.960\nSo those are our updates and again I don't\n\n362\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.960\nhave to do anything with my access\ncontrol policy or anything for this.\n\n363\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.736\nIt's kind of cool with those objects,\nvery cool product.\n\n364\n00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:13.030\nOkay so under System Local,\nwe have a couple more things.\n\n365\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.770\nI don't care about any\nof this stuff up here,\n\n366\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.520\nbut User Management is where\nwe'd create our users.\n\n367\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.860\nAgain, not covered in this course per se,\nwe have that covered already in detail.\n\n368\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.120\nYou definitely want to create users so\nyou don't have just admin, right?\n\n369\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.640\nSo you can see what's going on, but\nlet's take a look at our system policy and\n\n370\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.680\nthen we'll push that out in this episode.\n\n371\n00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.380\nSo I have a default system policy and\nto explain what it does.\n\n372\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.480\nSo I'm in again I'm gonna\ncreate a policy here, and\n\n373\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.670\nby looking at it you'll get an idea.\n\n374\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.440\nNow this is where we would\ndefinitely make some changes and\n\n375\n00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.240\nso I recommend absolutely doing this.\n\n376\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.320\nWhen you wanna apply your health\npolicy to tell you about problems, but\n\n377\n00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.260\nyou don't have to create\na health policy in this case.\n\n378\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.290\nWe want to create a system policy,\nTodd's system policy now, all right?\n\n379\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.557\nSo in optional description,\nI'm going to go ahead and create that.\n\n380\n00:20:02.557 --> 00:20:05.510\n[LAUGH] Wow, nice?\n\n381\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.361\n[LAUGH] Got to have\nthe underscores in there\n\n382\n00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:16.611\nOkay we're not in a hurry\ncuz we're on a 5506.\n\n383\n00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:18.878\nSo how's the kids?\n\n384\n00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:19.590\n>> Well you know, like I said,\n\n385\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.690\nit is impressive it is basically running\na virtual machine right there on\n\n386\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.290\ntop of the hardware.\n\n387\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.140\n>> All right.\nAll right.\n\n388\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.250\n>> But it is slow.\n\n389\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.830\n>> Be nice.\n\n390\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.280\n>> I'll be nice to Cisco for once.\n\n391\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.470\nAll right, so if we come over here and\nlook, now, we're gonna go through more of\n\n392\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.940\nthese than we did in the health policy,\ncuz some of these, we change.\n\n393\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.710\nFirst off, access control preferences.\n\n394\n00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.740\nI typically turn this enabled.\n\n395\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.710\nDepends if you have a lot of users.\n\n396\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.630\nIf you're the only administrator,\nit doesn't make any difference.\n\n397\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.870\nWhat this is saying is if someone changes\na rule in the access control policy or\n\n398\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:48.040\nreapplies it, something, that it\nmakes them put in a comment, right,\n\n399\n00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.970\nand it puts their name in there and\nwhat they did.\n\n400\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.750\nSo it depends on, again,\n\n401\n00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.320\nif you're the only administrator\nit wouldn't make any difference.\n\n402\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.310\nNow the Access List becomes more important\nbecause this says who can come in and\n\n403\n00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.710\nmanage the device from\nthe management interface.\n\n404\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.380\nRemember, we're plugged in to\nthe management interface at the ASA.\n\n405\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.190\nI'm using layer two connectivity\nto be able to do this\n\n406\n00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.670\nwith the IP address on the source for\nour module only.\n\n407\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.050\nNow that being said,\nnotice there 4, 4, 3 and 25.\n\n408\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.550\nI can add some rules.\n\n409\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.530\nNow, sometimes people take this out and\nput in a specific host.\n\n410\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.190\nBe careful with that\n\n411\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.030\nbecause if you can't get in from that\nspecific host you're locked out.\n\n412\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.940\nYou have to go in through your\ndefense center command line\n\n413\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.740\nto delete that once you get locked out,\nso it's not an easy process.\n\n414\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.150\nSo I do have that written down.\n\n415\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.650\nI can't remember off the top of my head.\n\n416\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.120\nSo let's say that you did the access\ncontrol list, got locked out,\n\n417\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.450\njust call Cisco and say hey,\nhelp me walk me through my Defense Center\n\n418\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.620\non deleting my access list and\nwho can enter.\n\n419\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.610\nSo I would typically leave this alone, but\nyou can, but the other thing is when you\n\n420\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.000\nabsolutely have to add something\nhere is when you're doing an SNMP.\n\n421\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.470\nSo I'm gonna put the IP address\nof my SNMP Manager, my NMS.\n\n422\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.460\nIf I don't, it won't work, right?\n\n423\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.540\nDon't tell you that,\n\n424\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.080\nhard to see in documentation,\nhard to find out this information.\n\n425\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.390\nSo I would find out the hard way.\n\n426\n00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.914\nThat's how I've learned\nmost things in my life, but\n\n427\n00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:04.236\nthe fact is that if you have an NMS\nstation, and down here's the SNMP.\n\n428\n00:22:04.236 --> 00:22:06.860\nYou'd think I'm gonna go configure that,\nand I'm gonna be fine.\n\n429\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.530\nNow, I didn't allow, until I'd allow the\nMNS station here with an access list, so\n\n430\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.980\nI'm just gonna cancel that,\nbut you do that, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.290\nLet's go ahead, email notification,\nthe rest of these aren't that important.\n\n432\n00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.260\nThis is why I put my relay host.\n\n433\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.490\nSo, if you set up certain events to email\nyou on like let's say you get malware you\n\n434\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.270\ncan, there's a lot of things you can do\nthat will send you events with email.\n\n435\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.890\nSo you can then configure this and\nthen test this.\n\n436\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.810\nI would highly recommend doing this,\nall right?\n\n437\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:42.580\nExternal authentication, now when I\nhave users and we have a local user and\n\n438\n00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.420\nwe have an 80 server configured as well,\nit'll go and create that user on\n\n439\n00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.220\nthe AD if it exists and it'll use that and\nautomatically make it an external user.\n\n440\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.680\nThat internal user will be gone.\n\n441\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.000\nIt'll automatically external user.\n\n442\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.490\nIf you don't have a role created for\nthat user,\n\n443\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.970\nthen it'll choose this default role and\nif someone clicked Administrator and\n\n444\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.190\nenabled this here, then their\ndefault will become Administrator.\n\n445\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.680\nSo we wanna be careful here.\n\n446\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.290\nI typically come in here and\nset it to system analyst read only, and\n\n447\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.360\nwe absolutely enable this,\n\n448\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.990\nbecause we're definitely gonna\nuse external authentication.\n\n449\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.510\nI already have this configured\non this defense center.\n\n450\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.540\nThat was one of the other\nthings that I do right away,\n\n451\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.740\nis configure my external users.\n\n452\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.450\nSo all of a sudden when\nI create a new user,\n\n453\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.200\nit'll automatically\nbecome an external user.\n\n454\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.160\nVery cool.\n\n455\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.080\nAnyways, I wanna make sure that\nif I forget to give them a role,\n\n456\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.600\nthey don't become administrator.\n\n457\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.970\nSo this is a problem\nthat some people have.\n\n458\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.040\nIPS policy, what this again is saying if\nyou create a change, then we're gonna\n\n459\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.010\ngo ahead and make it, they have to do it,\nand then it's sent to the audit log.\n\n460\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.080\nSo it's up to you,\nif you're the only one it doesn't matter.\n\n461\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.649\nSo what languages do you\nthink this thing runs?\n\n462\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.270\nEnglish and German, Chinese.\n\n463\n00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.750\n>> I imagine it supports quite a few.\n\n464\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.510\nCisco's usually pretty\ngood about being global.\n\n465\n00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.433\n>> You would think, but\nthis wasn't a Cisco product.\n\n466\n00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:54.038\n>> That's a good point.\n\n467\n00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:56.082\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it's just English, and\n\n468\n00:23:56.082 --> 00:23:56.765\nI can't see that.\n\n469\n00:23:56.765 --> 00:23:58.763\nEnglish and Japanese.\n\n470\n00:23:58.763 --> 00:24:03.198\n>> And if you were taking your source\nfile examine, then it would ask you that.\n\n471\n00:24:03.198 --> 00:24:07.033\nYou can set a login banner,\nthis is ACME Network.\n\n472\n00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:08.728\nYou're not supposed to be here.\n\n473\n00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:12.415\nNetwork Analysis Policy, this one\nagain if they're making any changes.\n\n474\n00:24:12.415 --> 00:24:14.810\nThe answer is if you have\nmore than one administrator,\n\n475\n00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.585\nyou're gonna turn this one on,\ncuz this is the preprocessor.\n\n476\n00:24:17.585 --> 00:24:19.772\nIf someone's making changes to that,\nit can make it.\n\n477\n00:24:19.772 --> 00:24:20.869\nSo you won't see attacks,\n\n478\n00:24:20.869 --> 00:24:24.210\nbecause it's reading the data wrong and so\nyou don't wanna screw with your network\n\n479\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.663\nanalysis policy unless you\nreally know what you're doing.\n\n480\n00:24:26.663 --> 00:24:29.705\nThey can watch our section on firepower,\n[LAUGH] but\n\n481\n00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:33.457\nthe point is if you don't have\ntraining on the preprocessors,\n\n482\n00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:38.512\nmake sure you turn this on, because you\ncan make it so your becomes useless.\n\n483\n00:24:38.512 --> 00:24:39.162\nSMP.\n\n484\n00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:41.531\nWe can configure SMP to work.\n\n485\n00:24:41.531 --> 00:24:43.365\nNow this state compliance.\n\n486\n00:24:43.365 --> 00:24:46.393\nYou can click this on yours, but I don't\nhighly recommend you ever click this\n\n487\n00:24:46.393 --> 00:24:48.315\nunless you're in a network\nthat supports this.\n\n488\n00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:52.929\nBecause once you turn this on and\nsay, OK, you can never turn it off.\n\n489\n00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:55.957\nSo if you don't know what this is,\nyou're like what's state compliance?\n\n490\n00:24:55.957 --> 00:24:59.029\nI'm not gonna explain it to you,\nthat means don't turn it on.\n\n491\n00:24:59.029 --> 00:25:02.889\nI'm serious, don't do this [LAUGH] unless\nyou really know what you're doing.\n\n492\n00:25:02.889 --> 00:25:05.895\nNow what you will come in here,\nthough is to time synchronization.\n\n493\n00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:10.612\nSo I'm gonna say, via NTP from,\n\n494\n00:25:10.612 --> 00:25:14.158\nwhat is it, pool.ntp.\n\n495\n00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:16.434\nThere's some cool stuff out there now.\n\n496\n00:25:16.434 --> 00:25:18.663\nI remember, it used to be so\nhard to get all this stuff done.\n\n497\n00:25:18.663 --> 00:25:24.710\nAnd then I'm gonna say, set my clock from,\nI'm gonna get it from the defense center.\n\n498\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:29.300\nSo my defense center's gonna get it from\nantip.pull.antip.org and I'm gonna say,\n\n499\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.830\njust get manage device and I push this\nout and get it from my defense center.\n\n500\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.528\nSo at a minimum,\nyou're gonna set time synchronization.\n\n501\n00:25:35.528 --> 00:25:36.851\nI would do my email.\n\n502\n00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:40.036\nI would also,\nmaybe you have your SMP you wanna set up.\n\n503\n00:25:40.036 --> 00:25:44.335\nBut also, wannna set maybe your access\ncontrol IPS and network analysis policies\n\n504\n00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:48.506\nwhere they have to put comments in if you\nmake any changes, because those things\n\n505\n00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:52.324\naren't gonna affect your system\ncompletely if someone makes a change.\n\n506\n00:25:52.324 --> 00:25:55.353\nAgain, if you don't have very many\nadministrators, it's only you,\n\n507\n00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.068\nnot important.\n\n508\n00:25:56.068 --> 00:25:58.635\nUser interface talks about how\nlong it's gonna time out and\n\n509\n00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:01.778\nhere's another button you never wanna\nclick and that's this guy here.\n\n510\n00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:03.101\nI guess you don't.\n\n511\n00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:06.674\nWhat's this saying is if\nI SSH into my managed device.\n\n512\n00:26:06.674 --> 00:26:12.374\nI can SSH and do things, but\nI can't do pseudo ever again, ever, ever.\n\n513\n00:26:12.374 --> 00:26:14.888\nAnd there's no reapplying and\nfixing this, it's gone forever.\n\n514\n00:26:14.888 --> 00:26:19.450\nSo don't say, permanently disable\nexport access unless you mean it.\n\n515\n00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.886\nSo, I'm gonna save this policy.\n\n516\n00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:25.046\n>> How dare they use the word\npermanently and actually mean it.\n\n517\n00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:25.812\n>> Well, at least they tell you.\n\n518\n00:26:25.812 --> 00:26:28.156\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least they tell you like yeah,\n\n519\n00:26:28.156 --> 00:26:29.109\nyou can click this.\n\n520\n00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:32.382\nThey should say, click this and\nyou're probably screwed or something,\n\n521\n00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:33.081\nI don't know.\n\n522\n00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:35.858\nThey should say,\nsomeone's gonna piss you off.\n\n523\n00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:39.708\nNow we don't have anything applied here,\nso I'm gonna click the green check mark in\n\n524\n00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:42.324\nand we're gonna come to a close\nhere where this is going.\n\n525\n00:26:42.324 --> 00:26:44.043\nNotice the health policy on this guy.\n\n526\n00:26:44.043 --> 00:26:45.598\nAgain, that's a time issue.\n\n527\n00:26:45.598 --> 00:26:47.473\nAnd we should fix that\nwith our system policy,\n\n528\n00:26:47.473 --> 00:26:49.261\ncuz we've just connected to an NTP server.\n\n529\n00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.083\nMight take a couple minutes, but again,\n\n530\n00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:57.098\nmy biggest problem that I see most of\nthe time right away is my NTP servers.\n\n531\n00:26:57.098 --> 00:26:59.974\n>> So at the point, we got a chance\nto see creating the help policy.\n\n532\n00:26:59.974 --> 00:27:02.547\nAnd in the system policy,\nwe saw applying that to the node and\n\n533\n00:27:02.547 --> 00:27:05.288\nsome of the different things that\nare involved to that process.\n\n534\n00:27:05.288 --> 00:27:08.986\nThese are all introductory steps\nof getting the fire power and\n\n535\n00:27:08.986 --> 00:27:10.914\nthe source fire up and running.\n\n536\n00:27:10.914 --> 00:27:14.178\nNow there's a lot of customizations that\ncan be done and Todd, you mentioned all\n\n537\n00:27:14.178 --> 00:27:17.541\nalong the way different areas where you\nmight choose to do something differently.\n\n538\n00:27:17.541 --> 00:27:21.874\nWe do explore a lot of that in more depth\nin the other FirePOWER Series that we did,\n\n539\n00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:24.188\nwhich is available right here on ITProTV.\n\n540\n00:27:24.188 --> 00:27:28.211\nBut for most people, the standard policies\nare pretty good until we need to go in and\n\n541\n00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:32.062\ncustomize them and we will see a little\nbit about that in the upcoming episodes,\n\n542\n00:27:32.062 --> 00:27:34.441\nbut this is a pretty good\nspot to wrap this one up.\n\n543\n00:27:34.441 --> 00:27:36.811\nTodd, did you have anything else you\nwanted to throw in before we close it?\n\n544\n00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:37.694\n>> No and that's good.\n\n545\n00:27:37.694 --> 00:27:41.023\nSo we're gonna make sure to do our\nsystem policy, our health policy.\n\n546\n00:27:41.023 --> 00:27:43.723\nAnd if we do those ahead of\ntime when we out our device,\n\n547\n00:27:43.723 --> 00:27:47.810\nthey can be applied as we are bringing\nthe device into our defense center.\n\n548\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.044\nYou get all this stuff done and\nmake sure, again, I didn't even show you\n\n549\n00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:53.922\nthe licensing, because that's\nway done before I add a device.\n\n550\n00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:55.948\nAgain, you're gonna get\nthe pack in your box.\n\n551\n00:27:55.948 --> 00:27:59.366\nOr I mean, obviously, you can get it\nfrom CCR or call Cisco and get it.\n\n552\n00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:03.024\nBut honestly, the licensing can be\ntime consuming if you're not careful.\n\n553\n00:28:03.024 --> 00:28:05.742\nSo that's a big process and\nlicensing is very important and\n\n554\n00:28:05.742 --> 00:28:09.494\nunderstanding when they're gonna expire\nand keeping track and managing those,\n\n555\n00:28:09.494 --> 00:28:12.614\nit might be a full time job for\nsomeone for all of your Cisco devices.\n\n556\n00:28:12.614 --> 00:28:14.820\nI know in some companies it is.\n\n557\n00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.584\n>> Well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe're gonna wrap this one up right here.\n\n558\n00:28:17.584 --> 00:28:22.418\nDefinitely stay tuned, we got more\nsource fire and fire power, I said both.\n\n559\n00:28:22.418 --> 00:28:22.952\n>> It's fine.\n\n560\n00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:23.973\n>> All sorts of names.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n561\n00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:25.811\n>> We got more FirePOWER content\n\n562\n00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:26.551\ncoming up.\n\n563\n00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:29.314\nWe haven't actually bought any thing yet.\n\n564\n00:28:29.314 --> 00:28:32.889\nLike we sort of have the unintentional,\nbut we still have to seedets.\n\n565\n00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:35.908\nSo a lot of action coming down and\ndefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n566\n00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:38.903\nBut otherwise, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n567\n00:28:38.903

00:00:17.490\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.362\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:23.480\nBack again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.350\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be diving\ninto file policies inside of Source Fire\n\n7\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.832\nor FirePOWER or\nwhatever we're going to call it today.\n\n8\n00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:32.350\nAnd [LAUGH] we jump in there.\n\n9\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.700\nFile policies let us have a neat level of\ncontrol over what files are allowed in or\n\n10\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.780\nout of our organization.\n\n11\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.620\nAnd it goes beyond what we can\nnormally provide with like client\n\n12\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.290\nside antivirus and\nolder solutions like that.\n\n13\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.610\nSo, really neat stuff and\n\n14\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.590\none of the first ways to implement\ntrue security inside a FirePOWER.\n\n15\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920\nSo, back with us again is Mr Todd Lammle.\n\n16\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.740\nHe's gonna walk us through the process,\nand Todd,\n\n17\n00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.480\nlet's talks about some file policies.\n\n18\n00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.309\n>> Yeah, okay, so\nwe've set up our FMC or what they\n\n19\n00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.075\nwere calling it Defense Center for our\nFirePOWER or Fire Site Management Center.\n\n20\n00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:06.260\nAnd we're gonna go to the name\nFirePOWER definitely.\n\n21\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.460\nSo just always be thinking FirePOWER.\n\n22\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.610\nAnd I heard the power's not\ngoing to be capitalized.\n\n23\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.265\nReally, who cares?\n\n24\n00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:12.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the fact is,\n\n25\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.230\ntired of talking about it, right?\n\n26\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.721\nSo the fact is is that what we did is\nsome basic configurations over here on\n\n27\n00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:24.772\nthe right where we do the configuration\nof our Defense Center FMC.\n\n28\n00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:28.160\nAnd we get that the basics on a license\nsystem policy, health policy.\n\n29\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.740\nAnd then we set up some tasks and\nscheduling and so on.\n\n30\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.500\nAnd there's some great, great tools there.\n\n31\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.310\nWell we get that done, but so on a day to\nday, let's go ahead and start looking at\n\n32\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.781\nwhat we're gonna do on a day to day\nbasis here, so scroll on over here.\n\n33\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.230\nAll right so, when we look at something\nlike this, we've got objects and this is\n\n34\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.220\nkind of one of the first things that we\ndo, but we don't have to create objects.\n\n35\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.050\nBut we absolutely will before we\nget to the access control policy,\n\n36\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.600\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n37\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.070\nBut I wanna go into a file policy, this is\nour malware file detection type, right?\n\n38\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.970\nSo basically if we wanna detect a file,\nso is it a PDF?\n\n39\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.210\nDo we check it for malware?\n\n40\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.375\nDo we block it, right?\n\n41\n00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.457\nWe have to look in the first 14 or\n16 body tests, what we look for\n\n42\n00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:18.320\nby default, we can look deeper,\nbut that's our default inspection.\n\n43\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.120\nAnd then we can detect\nwhether it's a PDF ei.\n\n44\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.340\nFor example, a lot of people may wanna\nblock EXE, but you'd be surprised.\n\n45\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.960\nI go out to a lot of customers,\nand they don't block their EXEs.\n\n46\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.810\nNow they need their Office documents.\n\n47\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.440\nTo me, I'd like to block them, so what I\ncan do is show you how I can take those\n\n48\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.710\nfiles and regardless of what their system\npolicy is, still make sure they're secure.\n\n49\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.710\nRight?\nThis isn't a very long episode, actually.\n\n50\n00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.990\nFile policies are kind of fun because,\nagain, we're controlling users.\n\n51\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.150\nThey're doing what we want them to do in\nthe background without them knowing, so\n\n52\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.204\nwe're going to come over here and\nlook at policies.\n\n53\n00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.692\nAnd again, once I look at policies,\n\n54\n00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.650\nwe can see here's our different\npolicies that access control.\n\n55\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.620\nThat's our main policy that we're\ngonna push out to our managed devices\n\n56\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.980\ninside the ACP as our start policy or\nIPS policy and our file policy.\n\n57\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.790\nThose go in our access control and\nthat's how they're pushed out.\n\n58\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.810\nWe put them in the ACP and\n\n59\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.620\npush them out which is why I'm\ncreating them first, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.588\nDoesn't matter if you create them first,\nthat's just the way I do it.\n\n61\n00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:14.130\nThen we're gonna come back, and\nthis is our Fire Site, right,\n\n62\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.320\nour network discovery policy.\n\n63\n00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.575\nSSL, if we're decrypting, and\nwe're not gonna do it on this ASA here.\n\n64\n00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:25.539\nIn the 6.0, new 6.1, we'll be able to\ndecrypt with ASA, but what you want\n\n65\n00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:30.500\nis a very powerful ASA to encrypt and\nre-encrypt data with a certificate.\n\n66\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.415\nIt's a lot of overhead, so\ntypically, we use external boxes and\n\n67\n00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:35.110\nyou can get those from Cisco.\n\n68\n00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.620\nWhere they're gonna come in,\ntake off certificate, make it unencrypted,\n\n69\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.301\nread the data, and re-encrypt it.\n\n70\n00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.183\nI think you can see the overhead\nin something like that.\n\n71\n00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:45.430\nI typically like to use\nthose as external boxes.\n\n72\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.340\nOr if you had a Source Fire appliance and\nwhen I'm saying Source Fire,\n\n73\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.560\nthey're 3D appliances,\nthey can handle something like that.\n\n74\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.380\nI'm not a big fan of using this with the\nASA, but it is something that you can do.\n\n75\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.017\nI wouldn't do it on the 5506 but\nhey, okay, and\n\n76\n00:03:59.017 --> 00:04:04.228\nthen user policy is part, this is where\nwe're gonna configure our LDAP and\n\n77\n00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:09.208\nour AD, so we can get the virus correct,\ngood quality FireSight data.\n\n78\n00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:13.384\nAll right, and then correlation,\nnow this is relatively advanced,\n\n79\n00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:17.204\nwhere we go in there and\nwe do correlation events, white lists,\n\n80\n00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:21.774\ntraffic profiles, and so on,\nretrospective analysis, very cool stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:24.220\nAll right, but\nwe're not gonna get to that today,\n\n82\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.540\nwe're gonna talk about our file policy.\n\n83\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.580\nWe'll come back tomorrow,\nwe'll create some objects and\n\n84\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.370\ndo our IPS policy access control\npolicy network discovery.\n\n85\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.680\nAnd if you followed along with the ASA,\nI gave you some basic configs.\n\n86\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.190\nAnd now I'm giving you some basic\nconfigs with the FirePOWER.\n\n87\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.810\nTake everything that I've taught you and\n\n88\n00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.040\nyou can push those out, and\nby the time you're done with this course,\n\n89\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.730\nyou're definitely implementing\nan ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n90\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.500\nVery cool.\nSo, we'll take a look here as we've got\n\n91\n00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.490\nthe file policies here.\n\n92\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.322\nNot much on this screen here, right.\n\n93\n00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:56.300\nSo, [LAUGH] we've got this over here and\n\n94\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.990\nwe're gonna say,\nthere's just like a fast jump link.\n\n95\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.790\nThat's all this is,\nto my access control policy.\n\n96\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.990\nWhy?\nBecause when you create your file policy,\n\n97\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.690\nit doesn't do anything until you\nput in access control policy.\n\n98\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.880\nSo again, by the time we get done today,\nwe haven't done anything still.\n\n99\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.761\nWe have our [LAUGH] ASA, and we poked\na hole in it with the permit any any,\n\n100\n00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.540\nright, so that might not be something\nyou wanna do at work, but hey,\n\n101\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.450\nif it's not working, it will make it work.\n\n102\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.340\nSo anyways, new file policy, I don't know,\nwe're gonna call it Don's file plat,\n\n103\n00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.450\nI shouldn't call it Don's cuz see,\nthis one's gonna work.\n\n104\n00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.820\nI'm gonna call it Todd's File Policy.\n\n105\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.550\n>> The failed ones,\nthose get assigned to me.\n\n106\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.235\nI see how it is.\n\n107\n00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:34.665\n>> Unlike those VPNs that we created.\n\n108\n00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:39.210\nAnd they work most of the time, but we\ncalled them Don just in case they didn't.\n\n109\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.600\nSo we're gonna say Todd File Policy.\n\n110\n00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.130\nI think we need underscores, I guess not.\n\n111\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.388\nAnyways, so we're gonna see over here,\nand now we get a couple tabs over here.\n\n112\n00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.671\nThe rules is,\nnotice it says no access control policies,\n\n113\n00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:51.617\nyou use this file policy, right?\n\n114\n00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.892\nSo again, once we've created, we haven't\ndone anything, but we are looking,\n\n115\n00:05:54.892 --> 00:05:55.850\nwe are going to be cool.\n\n116\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.340\nLet's go through this advanced tab,\n\n117\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.499\nthere's some cool stuff here you\nmight wanna pay attention to.\n\n118\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.400\nOkay, so enable, okay, the custom\ndetection list and clean list and\n\n119\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.760\nwe'll see this when we get\nback to our objects is that\n\n120\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.990\nthis is basically a white and\nblack list for files.\n\n121\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.710\nSo, if I get a file that comes in and\nit's always coming back with malware,\n\n122\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.200\nI can right click that file.\n\n123\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.430\nAnd it's really choosing a hash or sha276,\nand we're convicting this file, right?\n\n124\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.820\nAnd every time we see it,\nit's just gonna be blacklisted.\n\n125\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.090\nSo this is a white and black list for\nfiles and those are enabled by default.\n\n126\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.730\nAnd we'll see those in when\nwe get to our objects.\n\n127\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.100\nNow in this case here, probably for\nthis lab I'm gonna lower the score.\n\n128\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.840\nSo this is coming back from telos.\n\n129\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.220\nThey were sending out to sha,\nit's giving us a score.\n\n130\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.470\nAnd we're gonna say 76 and above.\n\n131\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.650\nSo if it comes back as malware,\nwe're pretty sure that it's malware.\n\n132\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.530\nBut I wanna kinda lower that just because\nwe're not in a, I won't go medium.\n\n133\n00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.280\nWe'll go high, so\nwe know it's got some infection.\n\n134\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.320\nBut the fact is I may\nlower this in production.\n\n135\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.300\nI might not, depending on how\nmuch you care about your files.\n\n136\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.832\nSo you may leave this alone, but here's\none of the things I don't leave alone, and\n\n137\n00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:07.984\nwe're looking at archive zip files,\nright, compressed files, whatever.\n\n138\n00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:09.300\nWanna say, do I wanna inspect them?\n\n139\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.940\nReally?\nI'm gonna let those through so\n\n140\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.580\nsomeone can open it?\n\n141\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.210\nI don't think so, but it's up to you.\n\n142\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.160\nI'm gonna say inspect them.\n\n143\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.080\nNot only that, if I can't inspect it\nbecause it's got a password on it,\n\n144\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080\nthen we're gonna block it.\n\n145\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.140\nNow, that might be something\nyou allow through, but\n\n146\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.350\nthis is a decision you have to make,\nright?\n\n147\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.510\nSo these are choices you have to make,\nand I can say block, so\n\n148\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.210\nif someone encrypts that,\nthen I can block that as well.\n\n149\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.740\nIf I can't unencrypt it and I can't read\nit, then we're just gonna block them.\n\n150\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.460\nRight, but I'm not telling you what to do.\n\n151\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.930\nI'm just telling you those\nare decisions you have to make.\n\n152\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.830\nMost of the time I spend on these\npolicies is, what are you gonna do here?\n\n153\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.700\nWhat are you gonna do here?\n\n154\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.190\nYou need to think about [LAUGH] this.\n\n155\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.821\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n156\n00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:48.644\nI'm just showing you what you\nneed to think about all the time.\n\n157\n00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:51.592\nAnd maximum archive depth,\nhere's one of the things is,\n\n158\n00:07:51.592 --> 00:07:55.440\nwe can basically allow them to say, okay,\nit can be archived twice cuz Do you\n\n159\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.450\never see something that's archived three,\nfour times and\n\n160\n00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.520\nyou think they're kinda up to some\nshenanigans is what I'm thinking, right?\n\n161\n00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.440\nSo in this case here,\n\n162\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.870\nif they go more than twice then\nI'm gonna go ahead and block them.\n\n163\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.940\nI might just say they can\nonly be archived once.\n\n164\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.090\nAgain, that's a decision you have to make.\n\n165\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.070\nNothing more than three is going to\nbe allowed through if I allow that.\n\n166\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.920\nThat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n167\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.520\nSo once I get this set and\nI choose what I want to do here,\n\n168\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.800\nmaking decisions based\non your security policy.\n\n169\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.600\nNot my policy, yours.\n\n170\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.530\nOkay, and so we're gonna come over here,\nand now I'll just sit here.\n\n171\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.310\nI gotta make sure I can see all this,\nand I'm gonna say Add File Rule, so\n\n172\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.990\nwe'll come back in here, so and\nI think Ctrl++ makes this bigger too.\n\n173\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.190\nAll right, so now in this case here,\nI can just detect files, and\n\n174\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.220\nthis is kind of funny but I can be sitting\nhere saying, okay, I'm detecting if these\n\n175\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.490\nkind of files are going on, and alert me\nif these kind of files are going across.\n\n176\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.970\nI can even store the files, but typically,\nI wanna do something like download and\n\n177\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.400\nif something's being downloaded,\ncheck it for malware.\n\n178\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.149\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n179\n00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:00.181\nSo, here's my application protocols and\na lot of stuff that we are looking at for\n\n180\n00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.067\nfiles is with HTTP so\nlet me do something here.\n\n181\n00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:07.803\nI'm gonna say, if it's HTTP and the\ndirection of transfer is any direction,\n\n182\n00:09:07.803 --> 00:09:09.582\nupload or download.\n\n183\n00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:14.760\nNow notice if we come in here and\nwe say, if it's SMTP can only upload\n\n184\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.350\nbecause simple mail transfer protocol,\nonly it's only sending right?\n\n185\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.670\nSo if I changed it to POP3,\nit'd only be download right?\n\n186\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.601\nSo that kind of thing.\nSo here I can use any but\n\n187\n00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:25.042\nI'm gonna say HTTP.\n\n188\n00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:29.133\nI'm gonna say if they're using HTTP and\n\n189\n00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:33.280\nI'm gonna block these files right?\n\n190\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.120\nAnd when I block I'm gonna reset it.\n\n191\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.160\nNow I wanna look for certain ones.\n\n192\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.136\nI'm gonna go to Executables,\nand I can just pick TORRENT or\n\n193\n00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:45.727\nMSEXEs but\nI'm gonna pick them all here and say, Add.\n\n194\n00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:49.540\nAnd so at this point here,\nif they're in HTTP and why.\n\n195\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.450\nThat's were a lot of the EXEs are are\nbeing downloaded on torrent and so on.\n\n196\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.250\nThey're using a browser and\nthey're downloading them from there.\n\n197\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.970\nSo I don't like this idea.\n\n198\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.580\nThey can't do it.\n\n199\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.490\nIt's gonna be blocked, and\nthen we can store the files and\n\n200\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.790\nthen we can do more analysis on them.\n\n201\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.567\nSo this is kind of broad in the sense\nthat I'm picking everything, but\n\n202\n00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:10.008\nif they're HTTP and they're downloading.\n\n203\n00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:14.890\nSo I can change this and\nI can say if they're doing anything,\n\n204\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.763\nany protocol in any direction, and\n\n205\n00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:22.093\nwe're gonna block them if\nthey're EXEs of any type.\n\n206\n00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.401\nAnd we can see all the different\nones that were here and\n\n207\n00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.680\nmaybe some of these you wanna allow,\nright?\n\n208\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.420\nBut in this case here, I'm just gonna\nblock all these and then store them and\n\n209\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.080\nthen so I'll save this, all right?\n\n210\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.350\nSo, now I've got this block with reset\nhere, so anyone tries to download\n\n211\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.650\nany type of executable that we mentioned,\nit's going to block that, okay?\n\n212\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.527\nNow on this other one,\nI'm gonna take and look at another, and\n\n213\n00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:53.510\nat this point here, I could choose,\nagain, HTTP and I can say Block Malware.\n\n214\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.060\nI usually choose any protocol for\nthe most part for\n\n215\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.730\na lot of my file policies because we can\ndo it so many different ways, right?\n\n216\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.029\nThat this is saying anyway.\n\n217\n00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:06.221\n>> And the end users, they get,\n\n218\n00:11:06.221 --> 00:11:08.814\nI don't wanna call it sophisticated\ncuz it's pretty low tech.\n\n219\n00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:09.460\n>> They do.\n\n220\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.570\n>> But you might block one port and\nsay, start switching to other ports or\n\n221\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.370\ndifferent protocols.\n\n222\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.600\nBitTorrent's notorious for that.\n\n223\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.390\n>> Yes.\n>> So by just saying any,\n\n224\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.230\nwe're gonna grab it no\nmatter what it's in.\n\n225\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.480\nIt helps protect from that.\n\n226\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.810\n>> It is a problem.\n\n227\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.380\nIt is a problem, and that's kind of why\nI'm not trying to be very succinct.\n\n228\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.540\nI try to be a little bit more broad,\n\n229\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.100\nbecause I want to capture\nit with a bigger net.\n\n230\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.280\nOkay, so in this case here,\nwe're gonna say, this company allows PDFs,\n\n231\n00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.460\nand I certainly know companies that\nblock all PDFs through emails.\n\n232\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.170\nSo I'm sending emails.\n\n233\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.020\nHey, did you get my email?\n\n234\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.650\nAnd I'm like, no, right?\n\n235\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.160\nSo, annoying for me because I feel\nlike I'm one of the good guys.\n\n236\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.650\nMaybe Cisco might argue with me,\ncuz I would argue with them.\n\n237\n00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.654\nBut the fact is, is that in this\ncase here, gonna block malware and\n\n238\n00:11:53.654 --> 00:11:56.948\nthere's a couple things\nwe can do with our PDFs.\n\n239\n00:11:56.948 --> 00:11:59.850\nIf I'm gonna click on PDF here,\n\n240\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.460\nbasically all types which is just this,\nand I can do a few things.\n\n241\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.210\nWell, first thing I want to\ndo is I want to store files.\n\n242\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.550\nNow if you're doing\nthe ASA Express Security,\n\n243\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.800\nthey ask you what are the different file\ndispositions that you can store, and\n\n244\n00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.360\nthe fact is is malware, unknown and\nthere's a custom, right?\n\n245\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.790\nI don't really store my clean files.\n\n246\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.450\nI don't care.\n\n247\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.852\nWhat I care about is malware and unknown,\nbut we can do custom applications, and\n\n248\n00:12:24.852 --> 00:12:25.965\ncustoms and stuff.\n\n249\n00:12:25.965 --> 00:12:30.795\nAnd so we can store those files, but here,\nnotice I don't think it's gonna allow me\n\n250\n00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:35.510\nto click that if I said Save because it's\nfor EXEs, but I can do dynamic analysis.\n\n251\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.230\nNow the reason I'm not picking\nthese right away is there's a lot\n\n252\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.230\nof time in something like this.\n\n253\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.701\nSo this is why we store files.\n\n254\n00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.990\nSo basically I'm gonna pick this and say,\nall right, we're gonna not block PDF's,\n\n255\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.004\nwhat we're gonna block malware\nif PDF if they have malware.\n\n256\n00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:54.343\nSo we're gonna send it to the malware\ncloud and we're gonna see tomorrow that we\n\n257\n00:12:54.343 --> 00:12:58.115\nonly have two seconds to send this\nfile to the malware cloud and back.\n\n258\n00:12:58.115 --> 00:13:03.660\nSo we can change that time, but\nwe send the not sending the file.\n\n259\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.300\nSo what happens is I can store this file,\n\n260\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.301\nand when I see a file disposition, then\nwhat happens is I can then right-click and\n\n261\n00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:15.190\nsay, send up to four file,\nthe dynamic analysis.\n\n262\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.590\nAll right, so I'm gonna store these,\nespecially if I get an unknown.\n\n263\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.410\nCuz they do come back as unknown,\nso I wanna send it back up for\n\n264\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.890\nanalysis, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:29.080\nSo we can do things like this, and\nI can add another file rule, and\n\n266\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.860\nin this case here, let's say that\nI just want to detect files.\n\n267\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.360\nAnd I want to get,\nlet's say, multimedia, and\n\n268\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.460\nI want MP4s, and if someone's\ndownloading MP4, I wanna get it.\n\n269\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.320\nSo I'm gonna click on that, I'm gonna\nstore it, I'm gonna add this over there,\n\n270\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.390\nand then I'll be able to attack.\n\n271\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.900\nIf they've got an MP4,\nI'm gonna store that file.\n\n272\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.676\nSo, anyways I'm gonna be able to do that.\n\n273\n00:13:51.676 --> 00:13:54.078\n>> You're gonna stop people from\nwatching those videos on the clock.\n\n274\n00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:56.250\nHow dare they try and-\n>> But it'll allow me to do it, so.\n\n275\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the important piece here.\n\n276\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.750\nIs that just cuz they can't\ndoesn't mean I'm blocked too, and\n\n277\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.290\na lot of people ask me that all the time.\n\n278\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.450\nI wanna get to this site, and\n\n279\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.200\nwhen we get to the access control files,\nwe'll see that.\n\n280\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.220\nWe'll block everyone from getting\nto Facebook for example, and\n\n281\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.130\nthis where the people in a company,\nthey get really wily on this and\n\n282\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.430\nthey can find ways to get to Facebook.\n\n283\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.790\nYou'd be so surprised.\n\n284\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.480\nI'm just like,\nhow are you getting to Facebook?\n\n285\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.520\nWe blocked everything.\n\n286\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.150\n>> If they would just focus a fraction of\nthat ingenuity on doing their actual job\n\n287\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.580\nthey would be impressive, but, yeah.\n\n288\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.177\n>> But there's so many companies\nthat I go to and they sit there and\n\n289\n00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:29.732\nFacebook is up all day, and\nI don't mean to pick on Facebook.\n\n290\n00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:34.724\nI might dislike it, but I'm not picking\non someone that likes Facebook.\n\n291\n00:14:34.724 --> 00:14:36.314\nI guess it's such a time suck.\n\n292\n00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:38.967\nBut the fact is is that there's\npeople on it all day long, but\n\n293\n00:14:38.967 --> 00:14:42.154\nI go into companies and they're like,\nand I don't wanna see anything.\n\n294\n00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:45.257\nAnd we're gonna take a look at that\ntomorrow how you can just block anything\n\n295\n00:14:45.257 --> 00:14:46.298\nbut them doing any work.\n\n296\n00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:49.720\nIn other words, they're not gonna get to\nany news sites, they're not get anywhere.\n\n297\n00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.362\nNo fishing sites, no bank sites,\nnothing, except for\n\n298\n00:14:52.362 --> 00:14:54.230\nthe work that they're supposed to do.\n\n299\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.850\nSo this is a great product and\nit can do a lot.\n\n300\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.588\nNow I'm also gonna tell you about some\nof the things it can't do with some of\n\n301\n00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:01.158\nmy customers.\n\n302\n00:15:01.158 --> 00:15:05.175\nI'm not here to stand up for\nCisco or bash them per se.\n\n303\n00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.386\nWhat I'm just trying to\ntell you is the good and\n\n304\n00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:10.902\nthe bad and the ugly, and there's more\ngood than this on this product than\n\n305\n00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:14.220\nanything else I've ever\nseen in the industry today.\n\n306\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:20.400\nOkay, so we've created this, and I wanna\nsend something up for dynamic analysis.\n\n307\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.040\nSo, I'm gonna say you don't wanna\nadd this, and I'm gonna say,\n\n308\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.500\ncuz my boss comes back and says,\nhey we're gonna allow EXEs, and\n\n309\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.120\nI just don't like that idea, or\nI'm gonna send something up.\n\n310\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.650\nSo I can do a couple things here.\n\n311\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.414\nI can send it to Sparrow, and\nmake sure that those are okay, and\n\n312\n00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:43.980\nSparrow's kind of like metadata on\nsteroids, like 200 points of data.\n\n313\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.718\nI can't quite remember exactly what it is,\nbut if you really want to get a lot of\n\n314\n00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:50.734\ninformation off the file,\nthen it takes time to get this done.\n\n315\n00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:53.787\nThe other thing is I could\ndo some dynamic analysis.\n\n316\n00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:57.840\nAnd certain files, and if they come\nback as malware, I'll ignore, and\n\n317\n00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.570\nthen store them, but I'm not\nstopping the file, this is the key.\n\n318\n00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.279\nSo if you don't want to stop the files but\n\n319\n00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.820\nyou want to get Dynamic Analysis on this\nfile, then you'll have to block it later.\n\n320\n00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.770\nSo we're sending the files and\nthen we're going to get analysis on it and\n\n321\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.900\nthen find that file, or block it later.\n\n322\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.620\nSo I'd have to go here to Dynamic\nAnalysis Capable, and notice there's EXE.\n\n323\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.880\nSo what here I can do Spero and\nDynamic Analysis, add this in here, and\n\n324\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:25.780\nwe can see what we're doing here,\nand we've got this PDF, MX, MSEXE.\n\n325\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.306\nWe're not blocking them, but\n\n326\n00:16:27.306 --> 00:16:31.354\nwe're gonna take some time to really get\na good analysis on them, and then we can,\n\n327\n00:16:31.354 --> 00:16:34.829\nbut this is an indication, and\na lot of my customers don't like this.\n\n328\n00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:37.209\nBecause I'm saying well now\nyou've gotta go to the screen and\n\n329\n00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:40.229\nyou've gotta look at these files, and\nyou gotta make sure they're okay, and\n\n330\n00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:42.390\nthey're like, nah, let's not do that one.\n\n331\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.290\nCuz they just don't wanna do all\nthat work, and it is some work.\n\n332\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.050\nAll right, so, we did get a warning here,\nlet's take a look here,\n\n333\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.570\nthis is probably saying hey, it's not\ngonna take effect, I cannot read that.\n\n334\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.630\nMalware block, lookups won't occur on\nMSEXE because the rule marked with warning\n\n335\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.060\nblock with these files.\n\n336\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.080\nThis is fine,\nbecause I chose all of these.\n\n337\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.540\nI can go into that and\ntake out those EXEs.\n\n338\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.731\nIn this case here, it's still going\nto do Dynamic Analysis and Spero and\n\n339\n00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:06.368\neverything else, but not on those.\n\n340\n00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:10.068\nSo you can decide to change that,\nso you don't get that error.\n\n341\n00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:12.610\nIt's really not that important.\n\n342\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.760\nNow, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n343\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:23.180\nI can come in here to\nDynamic Analysis Capable, and delete\n\n344\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.940\nthis guy out, and then choose these, and\nthen we'll stop getting that error, right?\n\n345\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.000\nWe should, I'm not saying we're gonna.\n\n346\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.990\nThen we don't do our Spero cuz\nthe Spero's on the EXE, but\n\n347\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.190\nwe're not gonna get that done\ncuz we're blocking EXEs.\n\n348\n00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:41.530\nSo again what we're saying is, if you have\nto allow EXEs, then do the Spero analysis.\n\n349\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.680\nYou're gonna make it slower,\nyou're going to slow down these EXEs,\n\n350\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.450\nyou're not gonna allow them to go out\nif you don't get a lot of data on it.\n\n351\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.240\nAnd you have to keep your eye on it\nbecause you're just basically not stopping\n\n352\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.180\nthe files, but you are getting an enormous\namount of data on it if it is infected,\n\n353\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.630\nyou will know, all right?\n\n354\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.730\nIt's just, you're gonna come back and\n\n355\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.170\nyou have to be available to look at\nthe events to find out what it is.\n\n356\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.770\nSo now, I can say save and then, I thought\nI did clicked on make analysis, so\n\n357\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.900\nI'll just cancel this one.\n\n358\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.380\nThe fact is is that I don't want to I\ncan just delete this guy right here.\n\n359\n00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.910\nI'm just giving you an example\nof what you can and cannot do.\n\n360\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.760\nSo one of them I'm blocking and\none of them I'm saying I wanna analyze, so\n\n361\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.210\nobviously it's not gonna work.\n\n362\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.620\nBut in this case here, if I had to allow\nthem through, that's when I would say,\n\n363\n00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.270\nwell let's just do the analysis.\n\n364\n00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.430\nGo to get information, and\nbe able to go to that screen and\n\n365\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.400\nfind out about those files and get the a\nsuper really good disposition on them, but\n\n366\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.560\nthe key is that there's\noverhead involved in this.\n\n367\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.450\nNot just on here and\nsending stuff to the cloud because\n\n368\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.480\nnow we're not sending the hash,\nright, we're sending the file.\n\n369\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.880\nWe're talking about a lot more time and\nthat it's not only that.\n\n370\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.800\nIt's now you have to go in there and\ncheck out the file disposition.\n\n371\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.720\nYeah, and obviously that's a compromise\nover just being able to block it or\n\n372\n00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.610\nwhatever, but at least it's better than\nnothing, that you are scanning it and\n\n373\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.520\nyou are getting that data.\n\n374\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.266\n>> We're at the key is,\n\n375\n00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:03.001\nbecause I get a little frustrated that\ncustomers are letting PDF's in without\n\n376\n00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:05.020\nanything, they're letting exe's in, so I.\n\n377\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.330\nSo I say I have to let them in.\n\n378\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.968\nI'll tell the network manager,\nI'll say, let's do this.\n\n379\n00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:16.340\nLet's at least send them out for analysis,\nand then we can look at them later.\n\n380\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.670\nThat's the minimum that\nyou have with this.\n\n381\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.160\nSo there's a lot of power here.\n\n382\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.610\nWhat kind of overhead do you want, right?\n\n383\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.410\nTo me, I'd just rather block everything,\nand make everything easier for me.\n\n384\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.501\nBy then it's not always about me.\n\n385\n00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:28.500\n[LAUGH] I can't believe that.\n\n386\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.440\n>> It goes back to that saying,\n\n387\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.935\nthe network will be a lot more stable\nif we didn't have users on it.\n\n388\n00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:33.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it totally would, yeah, yeah.\n\n389\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.490\nIf everyone just did what I wanted\nthem to do everything would be great.\n\n390\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.410\n>> All right, well Todd, at this point\nwe've seen the file policies, and\n\n391\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.630\nhow they work.\n\n392\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.750\nBut technically even though you\nset up a great policy there\n\n393\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.840\nit's not actually doing anything yet,\nright?\n\n394\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.730\nNot until we actually apply it,\n\n395\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.070\nwhich is what we're gonna\nget to in the next episode?\n\n396\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.020\n>> Yeah, so the first thing\nwe'll do in the next episode\n\n397\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.180\nis we'll create some objects because when\nwe get to the access control policy,\n\n398\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.430\nwe wanna create some network objects.\n\n399\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.467\nI don't really create a lot of objects.\n\n400\n00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.907\nWhen you're first starting\nout with this product,\n\n401\n00:20:02.907 --> 00:20:06.019\nI notice I created a lot of objects,\n[LAUGH] and it really helped me.\n\n402\n00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:09.214\nWhen I was doing other policies, and\nthen I'm like, okay, there's that object,\n\n403\n00:20:09.214 --> 00:20:11.419\nI feel a little bit more\ncomfortable with what I'm doing,\n\n404\n00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.510\nbut you don't have to create any object,\nyou can do anything that you want.\n\n405\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.051\nThere some, set some created\nobjects that I can just use, and,\n\n406\n00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:20.443\nwhen I'm in my access-control policy, I\ncan create the network objects for sales,\n\n407\n00:20:20.443 --> 00:20:21.770\nand some stuff like that.\n\n408\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.939\nWhen I'm in the access control policy,\nbut we'll take a quick look at those and\n\n409\n00:20:24.939 --> 00:20:26.466\nwe're going to hit the IPS policies.\n\n410\n00:20:26.466 --> 00:20:27.812\nSo that's going to be fun.\n\n411\n00:20:27.812 --> 00:20:30.986\n>> Yeah and just remember with all of\nthese policies,the nice part is we can\n\n412\n00:20:30.986 --> 00:20:34.120\nreuse them over and over again, and\nthen apply them in different ways.\n\n413\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.990\nSo it is pretty handy,\n\n414\n00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.470\nand that's something we'll\nsee again in later episodes.\n\n415\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.430\nBut as far as file policies are concerned,\nI think that pretty much wraps this one\n\n416\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.110\nup, so\nwe're gonna close it down right here.\n\n417\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.728\nI want to think you guys all for watching,\nand stay tuned because we've got more.\n\n418\n00:20:45.728 --> 00:20:48.522\nWell, we've got more firepower coming up,\nbut\n\n419\n00:20:48.522 --> 00:20:51.740\nwe also have more\nCisco ASA Express Security coming up.\n\n420\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.030\nSo stay tuned for those episodes, but for\nnow signing off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet\n\n421\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.190\n>> Todd Lamlee\n\n422\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.139\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:20:58.139 -->

00:00:19.469\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITPro TV, I'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n4\n00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.340\nback again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA express security.\n\n5\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.270\nAnd in this episode we're going\nto be diving into IPS policies.\n\n6\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.270\nAnd I know we've been talking\nabout fire power a good bit,\n\n7\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.820\nwhich is an intrusion prevention system,\n\n8\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.600\nkind of makes sense that eventually we're\ngoing to have to talk about those IPS\n\n9\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.830\npolicies where you actually get FirePower\nto do the stuff that it's designed to do.\n\n10\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.040\nThat's what we're gonna see\nright here in this episode and\n\n11\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.590\nhere to help, we've got Mr.\nTodd Lammle in the studio with us.\n\n12\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.230\nTodd, thanks for being back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.940\n>> It's great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.240\nSo, we just left off with file\npolicies and we want talk about,\n\n15\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.190\nnow let's get a little more in depth here\nIn the IPS policies in our policies.\n\n16\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.690\nSo my whole idea here is to, obviously\nwe're covering a certain objectives.\n\n17\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.380\nWe have objectives in mind, like when\nDon and I did the FirePower videos.\n\n18\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.900\nWe had the objectives for,\nI think there was the book here, right?\n\n19\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.240\nCertainly, but these are extremely\ndetailed and in-depth, right?\n\n20\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.580\nI wrote a book about it.\n\n21\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.940\nOn this express security we're doing.\n\n22\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.200\nSo we're gonna go in depth there.\n\n23\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.480\nI'm gonna show you how can\nyou implement IPS policies\n\n24\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.190\nwithout having to spend months learning or\nanything like that.\n\n25\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.570\nHow can we automate it so\nit works in your favor and\n\n26\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.360\ngives you protection without\ndoing a lot of work?\n\n27\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.310\nBut yet, you're still getting\nthe protection you need.\n\n28\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.460\nThat's our goal, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.790\nSo let's go ahead and\ndive right into that.\n\n30\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.650\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna click on Policies down here.\n\n31\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.320\nAnd notice when I click Policies,\nthe furthest one on the left comes up.\n\n32\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.980\nAnd we've got Intrusion policy,\nour File policy we did yesterday, and\n\n33\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.810\nthen we're gonna come over\nhere to Network Discovery.\n\n34\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810\nNow the reason we started with File\npolicy as I mentioned yesterday, and\n\n35\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.490\nthen do an intrusion policy,\nthen doing our access policy.\n\n36\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.650\nAnd again, you don't have to do it in\nthis order, it's just the way that I\n\n37\n00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.480\nprefer to do it, is because the file and\nintrusion policy has to be put into\n\n38\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.510\nan access control policy and\nthen pushed out to our managed devices.\n\n39\n00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.450\nWhy not just do it all at once instead of.\n\n40\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.550\nYeah, I've been to a lot of courses and\n\n41\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.650\ntaught a lot of courses where they do\nthe access control policy first and\n\n42\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.110\nthen you come back and have to add your\nfile and IPS policy as you do them.\n\n43\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.430\nAnd, update your AC access control policy\nso I just don't like doing it that way,\n\n44\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.640\nbut that doesn't mean you can't.\n\n45\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.359\nOkay, so let's go to IPS,\nthis is our snort rules right?\n\n46\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.650\nThere's no policies defined here.\n\n47\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.410\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate an IPS store policy, and\n\n48\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.430\nat a minimum this is what we're gonna do.\n\n49\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.780\nYou might not buy the file malware\nlicense, I understand that.\n\n50\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.830\nBut with the protection\ncontrol we get our IPS,\n\n51\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.590\nand then we put that in\naccess control policy.\n\n52\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.560\nWithout this all you have is kind\nof an access list with the access\n\n53\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.740\ncontrol policy.\n\n54\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.300\nAnd we already can do that with the ASA,\nokay.\n\n55\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.050\nSo we'll see this combined again with our\nnew interfaces, but let's go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.210\ncreate an IPS policy and implement it.\n\n57\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.190\nWe can make this extremely simple.\n\n58\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.460\nLike you say, I don't wanna know\nanything about the IPS policies, but\n\n59\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.440\nI wanna be protected.\n\n60\n00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.790\nAll right, I'll show you how to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.160\nAll right, so we're gonna name this.\n\n62\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.630\nWhat did I name the other file policy?\n\n63\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.230\nI named it Todd something, Todd IPS\nPolicy, file policy, optional description.\n\n64\n00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.390\nNow, remember I gave you those questions,\nlike transfer packets and\n\n65\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.980\nwhen we were installing and stuff?\n\n66\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.600\nI gave you different things to think\nabout, and I kept telling you, you have to\n\n67\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.060\nbe able to think about certain parameters\nhow you want to do your traffic light.\n\n68\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.280\nWhen we get to access control policy and\nwe're updating the ACP on a managed\n\n69\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.860\ndevice, do you want it to stop sending\ntraffic while ACP is being updated,\n\n70\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.900\nbecause you don't want any\ntraffic through uninspected, or\n\n71\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.000\ndo you want it to go through uninspected?\n\n72\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.410\nThat's a decision you have to make,\nbut your traffic doesn't stop.\n\n73\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.940\nYou don't stop your flows.\n\n74\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.310\nAnd this is another one\nof those decisions here.\n\n75\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.560\nOkay, drop while in line.\n\n76\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.020\nI'm gonna take this off and\nwe're gonna come back to this.\n\n77\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.640\nAll right, you will turn this on,\nor you're wasting your money.\n\n78\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.490\nBut for now, we turn it off.\n\n79\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.940\nNow there's some source fire,\n\n80\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.910\nnow I guess I'll call them\nCisco-authored policies in here.\n\n81\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.040\nNotice it defaults to what's\ncalled bounce-over security.\n\n82\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.170\nI could just take the cisco-authored\npolicies, implement these, put them in\n\n83\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.660\nan ACP, and push that out and now I have\nsome stored policies that are enabled.\n\n84\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.460\nBased on what they think that\nyou should have enabled,\n\n85\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.860\nvery smart people these people,\nvery smart.\n\n86\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.710\nAnyways, take one of these and\npush it out and you're done.\n\n87\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.720\nBut we can go little bit there further and\nwe will.\n\n88\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.800\nSo I could say connectivity over security,\nbalanced security and connectivity.\n\n89\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.690\nOops!\n\n90\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.040\nAnd we'll take a look at some of this,\nI can say no rules active or some,\n\n91\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.370\nput the activate any rules.\n\n92\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.170\nI'm gonna do security over connectivity.\n\n93\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.240\nThis is gonna give us\nmore rules are active.\n\n94\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.180\nBut let's start with more connectivity and\nthen we'll move to that.\n\n95\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.730\nSo, I'm gonna say create another policy.\n\n96\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.020\nAnd now, this takes couple of minutes.\n\n97\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.940\nEspecially again it depends.\n\n98\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.550\nAs we went into the, I think when we\nwere talking about the file policy.\n\n99\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.250\nHow long different devices take.\n\n100\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.190\n>> Yeah and remember that\nwhen we build these policies.\n\n101\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.470\nIf you think way back towards the\nbeginning of the series where we showed\n\n102\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.170\njust the ASA's default\ninspection policy right.\n\n103\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.160\nRemember all those inspect\ncommands that we saw?\n\n104\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.700\nWhen it's building a policy here it's\nbasically setting up something similar to\n\n105\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.810\nthat in the background that is massive.\n\n106\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.420\nThe Snort rules,\nTodd you had mentioned the text files for\n\n107\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.890\nmaintaining Snort back in the day.\n\n108\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.720\nThe open source, well guess it's still\navailable today, the open source version.\n\n109\n00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.960\nIt's gotta put together in\nsome cases thousands of rules,\n\n110\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.820\nmaybe even more than that.\n\n111\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.510\n>> Tens of thousands.\n\n112\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.450\n>> To be able to catch all the different\nattacks that are out there, and\n\n113\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.710\nit does take some time the first time.\n\n114\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.430\n>> Tens of thousands.\n\n115\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.470\nSo right now what this is doing is it's\ndetermining what rules based on this\n\n116\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.700\nbase policy, we'll call it.\n\n117\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.240\nAnd you're gonna choose a base policy\nhere, one or the other, and it could be no\n\n118\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.820\nrules active and that's fine, and then you\ngo and activate the ones that you want.\n\n119\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.340\nBut that's not a no-hands-on approach.\n\n120\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.600\nSo I'm trying to give you guys some way\nto do kind of a no-hands approach, but\n\n121\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.990\nstill give you good security.\n\n122\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.920\nSo basically,\nwe can see this is just taking it's sweet\n\n123\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.840\nlittle time out there deciding\nwhich one should I activate?\n\n124\n00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.380\nWhich one should I make active and\nmake drop rules?\n\n125\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.840\nWhich ones do I just make alert rules and\nso on.\n\n126\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.730\nSo it's deciding which rule\nis based on this policy.\n\n127\n00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.210\nSo we're almost done here and\n\n128\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.330\nthen we're gonna take a look\nat what I created for us.\n\n129\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.190\nSo right here now, I don't have the, Drop\non line, and that's why I took it off,\n\n130\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.510\nbecause I can put back on here.\n\n131\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.200\nSo, Todd's IPS Policy,\nConnectivity Over Security, so\n\n132\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.370\nwe're saying give us more\nconnectivity than security.\n\n133\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.710\nNow, why would we wanna\ndo something like that?\n\n134\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.160\nBecause if we enable more snort rules,\nthere's more overhead.\n\n135\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.820\nWe're gonna look at more rules.\n\n136\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.050\nThere's 25,000 rules that we can go in and\nactivate.\n\n137\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.360\nAnd that's kind of a lot of fun when\nyou're in a non production environment.\n\n138\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.030\nBecause absolutely nothing gets through.\n\n139\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.790\nAnd it gives you a lot of events\nin your Context explore and so on.\n\n140\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.140\nSo that's kinda lot of fun.\n\n141\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.370\nBut notice there's only has 850 rules,\nnot sure how many on this box but\n\n142\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.510\napproximately 25000 out of gas.\n\n143\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.150\nAnyways, [COUGH] and then 830 of\nthose are drop and generate events.\n\n144\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.440\n19 rules generate events.\n\n145\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.480\nSo let's go ahead and\nchange this to security over connectivity.\n\n146\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.110\nI can't choose the one I'm creating even\nthough it's listed there, wouldn't let me.\n\n147\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.580\nNow, when I got to security over\nconnectivity, it's gonna say,\n\n148\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.940\nwe're gonna turn on a lot more rules\nto have a little bit more overhead and\n\n149\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.720\nI'm also gonna show you how to go in and\ntweak this and\n\n150\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.240\nsay, I don't want the rules\nthat have a lot of overhead.\n\n151\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.190\nBecause I just don't have the time but\nI wanna allow the rules active but\n\n152\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.530\nif it has like you know what we consider\nhigh overhead, let's not activate those.\n\n153\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.680\nSo now we can see we\nhave 7,000 rules active.,\n\n154\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.570\nI kinda like that 6970 generate events.\n\n155\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.998\nRight, I'll drop and generate events.\n\n156\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:51.708\nSo we can go ahead and take a look at this\nand some things you wanna take a look at,\n\n157\n00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:54.692\nnotice there's this triangle in\nthe upper left hand corner and\n\n158\n00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:57.416\nwhat this is saying is,\nhey there's been some changes.\n\n159\n00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.475\nSure because I changed my base policy But\nyou're gonna go ahead and\n\n160\n00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:04.189\ncreate a base policy, and then you're\ngonna go ahead and create another layer,\n\n161\n00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.390\nand this is called policy layers here.\n\n162\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.380\nSo we basically create these in layers.\n\n163\n00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.260\nLet's take a quick look here.\n\n164\n00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.096\nSo here's my different layers over here.\n\n165\n00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:14.690\nHere's my built-in layer.\n\n166\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.740\nSo I choose a built-in layer.\n\n167\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.361\nI think I should always have a built-in\nlayer of some sort and then these\n\n168\n00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:26.100\nare the preprocessors note, these are\ndisabled and we'll talk about that later.\n\n169\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.380\nBut this is where you\nwould make any changes.\n\n170\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.560\nThen the base layer, plus any changes\nthat you would make would then create\n\n171\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.420\nthe actual policy, and here it is.\n\n172\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.040\nHere's the summary.\n\n173\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.550\nNotice the base in this one is the same\nbecause we haven't made any changes,\n\n174\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.760\nso-\n>> Todd, I know we can create more\n\n175\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.680\nthan one IPS policy, cuz we might have\ndifferent needs on different devices.\n\n176\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.720\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n177\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.319\nAnd when we create layers like this,\n\n178\n00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:53.012\nare we able to reuse the layers\nbetween the different policy?\n\n179\n00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:56.651\n>> Okay, that's a really great question,\nand that's a very common, and\n\n180\n00:08:56.651 --> 00:08:59.900\nthat's when we create something\ncalled a shared layer.\n\n181\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.720\nSo a shared layer is created by going\ninto the user layers here, and so\n\n182\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.090\nthey have a default by changes layer, so\n\n183\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.920\nwhen I change anything, any rules it's\ngonna be put into my changes layer.\n\n184\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.410\nI can't change anything\nhere in the base layer.\n\n185\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.407\nBut I can come over here and\ncreate a shared layer.\n\n186\n00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:16.679\nSo the shared layer,\nno shared layers from other policies, so\n\n187\n00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.780\nwe can go ahead and create one.\n\n188\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:24.430\nSo at this point, here, I add a layer and\nthen I click Add a layer and I share it.\n\n189\n00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.709\nAnd now what will happen is I tweak it\nin cuz this is why it's a good question\n\n190\n00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:33.127\nbecause I'm gonna have multiple IPS\npolicies in my company but I wanna tweak\n\n191\n00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:37.981\nit for I don't know different apartments\nwith different branches whatever it is.\n\n192\n00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.842\nBut I can use a base policy and then\nput it in my configured company policy\n\n193\n00:09:42.842 --> 00:09:47.230\nthat has some of the defaults,\nand then tweak My Changes layer.\n\n194\n00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.440\nSo if I add a layer here,\ntweak the My Changes layer,\n\n195\n00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.740\nMy company Unique policy changes.\n\n196\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.730\nSo then I'm gonna put this below the My\nChanges layer and that way anything above\n\n197\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.490\nthe My Changes layer will take\na fact above anything below it.\n\n198\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.330\nSo this is kind of a cool way to do it.\n\n199\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.540\nSo notice it's up here and I'm gonna move\nthis down and I'm gonna make changes in\n\n200\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.940\nthis layer that are unique for my company\nand that would be in every policy.\n\n201\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.130\nAnd then, what's ever unique for that\nbranch would be in the My Changes layer.\n\n202\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.300\nSo let's go ahead and\njust leave that there.\n\n203\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.111\nWe would just now make it a shared\nlayer and it be kinda cool.\n\n204\n00:10:26.111 --> 00:10:29.480\nSo notice I have my different layers\nhere and what I'm making is My Changes.\n\n205\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.050\nNow, if I come up here in rules, I'm up\nhere in the left-hand side, and I see all\n\n206\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.970\nof the available rules then anything that\nI change will be put into My Changes\n\n207\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.010\nlayer, and would take effect above any\nof these other layers that I have.\n\n208\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.400\nRight now everything's being used here\non the Security Over Connectivity.\n\n209\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.234\nSo here I've got, let's go ahead and\nsay, I'm getting some attack on FTP and\n\n210\n00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.811\nI wanna look at all\nthe rules based on FTP.\n\n211\n00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:56.520\nI could click this right here,\nit would take a little bit of time, and\n\n212\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.223\nit would tell me how\nmany rules there were.\n\n213\n00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:00.568\nAnd then I could change\nthe real estate to all active.\n\n214\n00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:04.440\nSo I would enable 22, or 25,000 rules.\n\n215\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.690\nA lot of overhead, very cool though.\n\n216\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.157\nA lot of fun.\n\n217\n00:11:09.157 --> 00:11:12.311\nNow, I'm showing you this,\nI'm gonna go into some detail here, but\n\n218\n00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:16.330\nreally when we get into network analysis\nis where you change your start up rules.\n\n219\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.171\nBecause why come in here when I can just\ngo into my Network Analysis see an event\n\n220\n00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:25.951\nthat has taken place and then right click\nand change then find tune it there.\n\n221\n00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:30.584\nBecause really what we're doing is when we\nsee a Snort Rule if we're gonna search for\n\n222\n00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:33.911\nevery scene of that from a Snort,\nwe're gonna search for and\n\n223\n00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:35.950\nmae sure it's not a false positive.\n\n224\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.310\nIf it is a false positive then\nwe're gonna make a change to it.\n\n225\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.730\nSo I'm gonna take FTP and\nlet's see did I, yeah, 242 results.\n\n226\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.330\nSo notice I can come in here and\n\n227\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.140\nI'm gonna go down to these guys here and\nI'm gonna click on this.\n\n228\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.230\nAnd I can change it, it's disabled so\nwe can see this drop in generate events,\n\n229\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.382\nthis is just generate event and this is\ndisabled so I'm like, I don't know this\n\n230\n00:12:01.382 --> 00:12:07.120\nJohntime.mtp, myftp.name, I'm gonna say,\nI'm having a DNS issue with it, whatever.\n\n231\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.709\nLooked up, this is the Snort.\n\n232\n00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.064\nNow, I could come in here and type if\nI saw this event, I'd type SID, space,\n\n233\n00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.678\nwhich stands Snort ID, and then 22407.\n\n234\n00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:20.265\nSo in this case, here, I'm gonna take the\nrules tape and I'll go ahead and, I don't\n\n235\n00:12:20.265 --> 00:12:24.495\nknow, make it drop and generate events,\ncuz we're seeing a problem with it.\n\n236\n00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:25.540\nSo I'm actually changing it.\n\n237\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.340\nWe'll look over here and\nwe'll see the rule state change.\n\n238\n00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.530\nAnd now this changed where, I'm up here,\nbut this gonna change in my changes layer.\n\n239\n00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.832\nSo if I come over here, I'm gonna\nclick on Security Over Connectivity,\n\n240\n00:12:36.832 --> 00:12:41.090\n[BLANK AUDIO] and click on Rules,\nand the FTP's still there.\n\n241\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.600\nAnd notice that right here,\nit's not changed here.\n\n242\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.340\nBut if I come up to\nthe My Changes layer and\n\n243\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.360\nclick on Rules,\nthis is where it's changed, right here.\n\n244\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.560\nAnd down here it should tell\nme it was changed above.\n\n245\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.060\nIt should be pink, but\nit's not showing me that.\n\n246\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.320\nI did change it, right?\n\n247\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.030\nAnyways, nonetheless, it'll tell you\nwhere it's actually been changed at, and\n\n248\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.250\nwhere now we're managing it.\n\n249\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.630\nSo there's a couple things that we can do\nin here that are very, very important.\n\n250\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.490\nI'll get straight to the point.\n\n251\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.980\nI can change the rule state.\n\n252\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.130\nNow, one of the things that\nI do is I filter events.\n\n253\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.250\nSo let's say that you get some\ndifferent types of events and\n\n254\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.530\nyou're getting to many and\nyou know they're false positives, well,\n\n255\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.300\nI can just come in here and\ndisable the rule.\n\n256\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.250\nThat's the easiest thing to do.\n\n257\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:29.120\nLet's say that it's false positives\nbecause it's coming from engineering or\n\n258\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.980\nsomething where they're manufacturing and\nwe know that's okay, what they're doing.\n\n259\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.880\nThey're testing firewalls and\nstuff like that.\n\n260\n00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.100\nWe know that they're not real positives,\nso we can suppress them.\n\n261\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.230\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n262\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.893\nThe first thing I can do\nis I can threshold events.\n\n263\n00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:43.781\nFirst off, I can limit the source, so\n\n264\n00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.679\nif I'm getting something from these\nsources and I'm getting a lot of events,\n\n265\n00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:51.830\nand I'm saying I'm getting too many\nevents, let me just limit them.\n\n266\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.835\nI don't need to see 60 every minute,\n1 every second, I can just see 1 a minute.\n\n267\n00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.944\nFor example, I just said that 1 every 60\nseconds something like that regardless\n\n268\n00:13:59.944 --> 00:14:01.460\nwith how many I got.\n\n269\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.370\nThe other thing is, I could trash all\nthem and knock it as many events as kinda\n\n270\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.898\none of the things I'd probably do here,\nI probably limit the source,\n\n271\n00:14:10.898 --> 00:14:14.890\nI could threshold how many events\nthat I'm getting as well and\n\n272\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.317\nI can actually do a little both here.\n\n273\n00:14:17.317 --> 00:14:21.560\nSo in this case, here,\nI'm gonna limit our threshold here.\n\n274\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.920\nThat's awesome, we can take a rule that we\nfind is a, that's not a false positive.\n\n275\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.300\nAnd we wanna see events,\nI just don't wanna as many.\n\n276\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.440\nNow, that being said,\nI'm gonna go back here.\n\n277\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.450\nNow, suppression is kind of a weird\nthing because what we're saying is if I\n\n278\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:41.490\nsuppress a rule that means the rules\nremain active and if it's a drop rule,\n\n279\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.520\nwhich this one now is, it's gonna be\ndropping packets in the background but\n\n280\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.010\nI'm not gonna be alerted on it.\n\n281\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.490\nIt's kind of a very dangerous thing.\n\n282\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.440\nSo you could do that,\n\n283\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.380\nI just find it, there's probably not too\nmany case uses for something like that.\n\n284\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.930\nSo probably better something like this and\nthis is more,\n\n285\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.710\ndo I wanna suppress\nthe source in the network?\n\n286\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.160\nSo this would be like my R&D who\nI'm getting a lot of stuff from\n\n287\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.570\nthat we know it's a false positive.\n\n288\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.150\nI don't wanna suppress the rule for\neveryone.\n\n289\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.640\nSo I want someone to come in if we see\nthis I want it dropped, but not for\n\n290\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.210\nthese guys because I know they're testing.\n\n291\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.690\nSo I know I put in the R&D network, here.\n\n292\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.030\nTen ten ten zero.\n\n293\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.720\nAnd then, I'm gonna tell them,\nI'm not gonna get any events on them, and\n\n294\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.630\nwe're not gonna draw but the rule's\nsuppressed just for this network.\n\n295\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.210\nSo this is kind of cool if you had an R&D.\n\n296\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.310\nSo now we'll see that we have an events,\na threshold suppression right here.\n\n297\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.817\nNow, under dynamic state, this one's kinda\ncool because I can sit here and say,\n\n298\n00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:47.275\nif I get something from a source, pretty\nrare I do something from a destination.\n\n299\n00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:51.918\nIf I get something from a source and\nit's coming from the outside network, or\n\n300\n00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:56.776\na certain place I'm watching this come in,\nand I know that it's not necessarily\n\n301\n00:15:56.776 --> 00:16:01.132\na problem if I see one or two events But\nif I get more than one or two events,\n\n302\n00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:05.150\nit could be an attack so\nI wanna change the state of the rule.\n\n303\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.180\nSo in this case here,\nif I'm saying it's coming from.\n\n304\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.710\nI don't know, I'll just make up a network,\n63, 64 sounds good.\n\n305\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.770\nAnd one dot, one dot zero [LAUGH] network\nand I'm seeing something from them.\n\n306\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.940\nAnd what I want to do is say, okay,\nevery once in a while if I get something.\n\n307\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.600\nIt's not an attempt, but\nif I get a lot, it is an attack.\n\n308\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.816\nSo, I'm going to come in here and\n\n309\n00:16:24.816 --> 00:16:29.579\nsay, if I get 100 events in 600 seconds,\nwhich is five minutes.\n\n310\n00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:33.580\nSo now, I'm getting a lot\nof events in five minutes.\n\n311\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.950\nSo, if it's just an alert rule, I'm going\nto change it to drop and generate events.\n\n312\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.110\nNow, if it stops happening,\n\n313\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.392\nI'm going to go 300 seconds and\nthen change the rule state back.\n\n314\n00:16:43.392 --> 00:16:47.070\nSo, what's cool about this is,\nyou're going out there.\n\n315\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.120\nMaybe something alerts it\nevery once in a while.\n\n316\n00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.990\nWe know that's just a false positive, but\n\n317\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.700\nif we get a lot,\nwe want to change that rule.\n\n318\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.300\nAnd then, when we stop getting them again,\nthen we're just going to change it.\n\n319\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.900\nWe don't want it to be a drop all the\ntime, becasue it's not really a problem.\n\n320\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.960\nWe can change it back,\nthat's a very cool, cool technology here.\n\n321\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.660\n>> And this is all part of the learning\nprocess that you go through when you\n\n322\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.100\ndeploy one of these the first time, right?\n\n323\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.970\nBecause the guys at Cisco,\nthe Talos guys, and\n\n324\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.800\neverybody working on the FirePOWER team.\n\n325\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.670\nThey know what's pretty typical, but\nthey don't know your environment.\n\n326\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.560\nAnd so there is going to be a period\nof time when you first deploy.\n\n327\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.990\nSo, you've got to learn what's\na false positive for you.\n\n328\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.090\nBecause that might not be a false\npositive for somebody else.\n\n329\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.620\nIt might be a very\nlegitimate attack to them.\n\n330\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.100\nBut to you, it's just a false positive,\nso you clear that out.\n\n331\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.660\nAnd having that level of\ncustomization's really important.\n\n332\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.080\n>> And that's right, so\nwhenever we see an event.\n\n333\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.570\nAn IPS event, or connection event, or\nsomething, we're going to go look, so\n\n334\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.890\nI train my customers.\n\n335\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.030\nYou need to go in there and look.\n\n336\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.880\nWe need to dive in there, and\nwe need to find out what the problem.\n\n337\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.942\nIf it's a false positive,\n\n338\n00:17:43.942 --> 00:17:46.450\nwe're going to tune the snort\nrule that's causing this issue.\n\n339\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.620\nWe'll suppress it or threshold it or\nwhatever, limit it and\n\n340\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.950\nthen we're going to clear out the event.\n\n341\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.330\nI keep telling them,\n\n342\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.900\nI'm going to go look at your contact\nexplorer every time I log in.\n\n343\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.360\nI shouldn't see anything\nthere because you're going to\n\n344\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.880\nexplain to me why anything's red.\n\n345\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.630\nAnd we'll take a look at that later today.\n\n346\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.950\nAnyways so, we can do other things like\nset up a wordings like snmp on this role.\n\n347\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.670\nRight, It's it's very important.\n\n348\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.450\nI don't know how important this\nparticular role I picked is, but\n\n349\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.250\nin case we're going to do is snmp.\n\n350\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.020\nI can also leave a common on it.\n\n351\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.620\nNow over here, is something called-.\n\n352\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.050\nI'm just gonna give it smtp here.\n\n353\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.370\nNow we're just going to look\nat all the rules again.\n\n354\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.508\nAgain, anytime I make a change it's\ngoing to be put down here into the 'My\n\n355\n00:18:25.508 --> 00:18:27.420\nChanges', right.\n\n356\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.540\nAnd I can make something here,\nunique in my other layer, but\n\n357\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.780\nthat's not important here.\n\n358\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.960\nBut I can look at the rule configuration.\n\n359\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.620\nAnd I could say okay,\nwe're using security over connectivity,\n\n360\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.020\nI want to see all the rules that\nare drop and generate events from this.\n\n361\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.590\nOkay, so when would I use this?\n\n362\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.090\nWhen typically I get a rule update,\nand I apply it and\n\n363\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.810\nI want to see what is changed.\n\n364\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.730\nSo, what I'm going to do,\nso this is kind of cool.\n\n365\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.080\nI can look at it here, and\n\n366\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.670\nagain, I can change these rules\nto whatever I want it to be.\n\n367\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.290\nSo down here, I'm going to come\ndown here way to the bottom,\n\n368\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.120\nwhere it says Rule Update.\n\n369\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.740\nI really don't have rule\nupdates done on this.\n\n370\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.390\nBut when we get a rule update, remember,\nwe talked about that yesterday,\n\n371\n00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.980\nwe went in there.\n\n372\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.250\nWe were doing the system health policy and\nwe were showing the updates.\n\n373\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.640\nAnd one of the things is\nyour rule updates, and\n\n374\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.350\nthey're going to show up in here.\n\n375\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.530\nNow I can click on this,\n\n376\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.530\nand it's going to say,\nwhat's changed since the last rule update?\n\n377\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.810\nWhat's new since the last rule update?\n\n378\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.370\nWell I haven't had any updates,\n\n379\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.760\nI haven't done it on this box\nbecause I always reset it.\n\n380\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.600\nSo, here's what's new actually, and\nthese are updated all the time,\n\n381\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.450\nyou want to get the latest updates and\nimplement those.\n\n382\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.968\nSo remember, let me see if I can\ngo back over here, System Updates.\n\n383\n00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:44.820\nI'm going to say, Open Link in New Tab,\nbecause we talked about this yesterday and\n\n384\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.810\nthis is kind of important.\n\n385\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:50.180\nSo, here's my rule updates, so\nI'm going to come down here.\n\n386\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.381\nAnd I'm going to say,\nEnable Re-ocurring Rule Updates, and\n\n387\n00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:59.680\nwe had changed this to 12 o'clock\nevery night or something like that.\n\n388\n00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.782\nAnd then remember, if you do that,\nyou have to reapply the policy and\n\n389\n00:20:02.782 --> 00:20:04.670\nthen reapply the access control policy.\n\n390\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.260\nNow, you don't have to do it from here,\n\n391\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.330\nyou can do that manually,\nwhich is possibly what you'll do.\n\n392\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.800\nOkay.\n\n393\n00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.510\nSo that being said,\nthose are our policy layers.\n\n394\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.570\nAnd we can look in here and\nthen we can also,\n\n395\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.080\nif something comes up with Microsoft.\n\n396\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.050\nWe can look in here and\n\n397\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:30.060\nlook for a specific Microsoft\nvulnerability that's been released.\n\n398\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.950\nSo, there was a Chrome one that I\nwas just working on the other day.\n\n399\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.880\nI'm going to see if I can find it,\nit's 41 or something.\n\n400\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.420\nAnyways, this will come back and tell me,\nand it obviously wasn't this one.\n\n401\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.390\nBut it will come back and I can change\nthis and say, this is a new vulnerability.\n\n402\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.290\nWhat do we have for this and\nwhat are they set to?\n\n403\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.820\nI want to be careful with this.\n\n404\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.640\nAnd if I found this, we got some here,\nI can come in here and\n\n405\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.190\nchange the rule state and say.\n\n406\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.090\nThese aren't a problem or\nthey are a problem for me, and\n\n407\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.790\nthen I can just click this right here and\nI can change them all, all at once.\n\n408\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.920\nSo, I work in this Microsoft vulnerability\narea, every once in awhile..\n\n409\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.880\n>> Well one of the nice features here,\nis that what you're doing,\n\n410\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.245\nwhat you're showing us right there.\n\n411\n00:21:05.245 --> 00:21:08.685\nThat would let us stop\na vulnerability even\n\n412\n00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.865\nthough the machines aren't\npatched on the back end.\n\n413\n00:21:10.865 --> 00:21:13.815\nIt actually might not even fix\nthe problem, but we're able to stop it.\n\n414\n00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:14.631\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n415\n00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:19.405\nSo, we want to get our rule updates,\nand then this rule accordion you may or\n\n416\n00:21:19.405 --> 00:21:20.375\nmay not wanna use.\n\n417\n00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:24.265\nBut basically generate events,\ndrop and generate events.\n\n418\n00:21:24.265 --> 00:21:26.700\nThis will tell me all the rules.\n\n419\n00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.810\nOkay, before we apply this,\nyou want to come in here.\n\n420\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.640\nI'm not making a lot of changes right now,\nI'm choosing a base layer.\n\n421\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.150\nI'm not sure what rules I have to\ntweak based on my environment yet.\n\n422\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.540\nWhich is why I don't have the drop\nin line button clicked, right.\n\n423\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.950\nSo, that one being said, there's one\nmore thing that we want to look at, and\n\n424\n00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.310\nthis is our Firesight recommendations.\n\n425\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.320\nAnd we're going to come back to this one,\n\n426\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.510\nbecause we haven't\nconfigured Firesight yet.\n\n427\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.530\nNow, it does run by default, but\nremember we mentioned it yesterday.\n\n428\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.120\nShowed you it gives you errors,\n\n429\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.100\nif you don't have your access\ncontrol policy applied.\n\n430\n00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.810\nSo, once we apply that access control\npolicy, we go back into Firesight again.\n\n431\n00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.170\nThen we come back to our IPS policy and\nwe can do our FireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n432\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.360\nSo FireSIGHT again is a passive\ntechnology that goes out and\n\n433\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.660\nlooks at our host user's applications,\ngives us information.\n\n434\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.700\nAnd then it's going to come back,\nlook at your network.\n\n435\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.890\nThis is what's cool, so I'm going to come\nup here to the top policy information.\n\n436\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.556\nIt's going to look at your network, and\n\n437\n00:22:18.556 --> 00:22:21.150\nthen it's going to make recommendations\non what rules should be enabled.\n\n438\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.860\nWhich ones are disabled, dropped,\nbased on the traffic that it sees.\n\n439\n00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.770\nSo you got like a little buddy\nworking in the background.\n\n440\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.320\nSo, come back here,\nchoose a base policy, apply it.\n\n441\n00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.260\nAnd then do the FireSIGHT\nrecommendations and\n\n442\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.660\nthen schedule that to run every week and\nthat might work for you.\n\n443\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.820\nThen when you see your events then\nyou're going to go and tune them.\n\n444\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.060\nBut I don't have to come in here and\ndo it.\n\n445\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.590\nI was showing you how and where to do it.\n\n446\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.330\nAnd we can get into a little\nmore detail on it, but\n\n447\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.430\nreally don't have to do that until you\nget events, and then you tweak it.\n\n448\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.110\nSo based on that,\nI don't have the drop while in line.\n\n449\n00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.320\nOkay, so once I do this, I let it run for\n\n450\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.390\na little bit,\nsee what was going to be dropped.\n\n451\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.360\nSee what problems were going to occur,\nlooking at my events.\n\n452\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.280\nTweaking any false positives, suppressing\nthresholding, rate based events.\n\n453\n00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.660\nAnd I was going to, I'll change all those,\nget set, come back here draw up online.\n\n454\n00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.560\nReapply my ips policy,\nreapply my access control policy, okay.\n\n455\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.870\nSo, under advanced settings here,\nwe used to have more settings here.\n\n456\n00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:26.520\nAnd they moved these and\nthese are my pre-processors, right?\n\n457\n00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.460\nAnd that's another class,\n\n458\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.070\nbut these pre-processors tell\nSnort how to read the data.\n\n459\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.110\nLike, where's it coming from?\n\n460\n00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.690\nIs it coming from an Apache host?\n\n461\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.260\nYou know, how will we read an IP?\n\n462\n00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.830\nWe're normalizing the IP headers and\nsending them back.\n\n463\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.790\nIf we don't normalize the IP\nheaders with our pre-processors,\n\n464\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.910\nthen we might miss an attack.\n\n465\n00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.070\nSo, that's some of the things\nthat are important,\n\n466\n00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.840\nbut pre-processors are very important.\n\n467\n00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.180\nAnd we don't want to mess those up or\nwe're going to read the data wrong.\n\n468\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.806\nSo, I'm going to come out of here,\n\n469\n00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:53.904\nwe're not going to do the fire\nsite recommendations yet.\n\n470\n00:23:53.904 --> 00:23:57.889\nSo, I'm doing the IPS policy and I'm\ncreating a base policy, pushing it out.\n\n471\n00:23:57.889 --> 00:24:01.341\nI came in here, I looked around and\nshowed you how you would make changes.\n\n472\n00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.425\nBut then we're gonna see from our Network\nAnalysis screen we can make changes\n\n473\n00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:04.951\nfrom there.\n\n474\n00:24:04.951 --> 00:24:07.535\nAll right, so I'm gonna go to Policy\nright here and notice it says, hey,\n\n475\n00:24:07.535 --> 00:24:09.844\nthere's changes made, and\nthen I'm gonna say Commit Changes.\n\n476\n00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:11.760\nAnd now, I'm creating my policy.\n\n477\n00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.810\nSo, description of changes,\n\n478\n00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.290\nremember in our system policy when we\ntalked about that, we can force that and\n\n479\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.568\nsay, you can't move on until you put a\ndescription if you change the IPS policy.\n\n480\n00:24:23.568 --> 00:24:28.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead and create this,\nand then we'll finish this section, and\n\n481\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.310\nthen we'll create this, and\nthen we're gonna go through and\n\n482\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.195\ntalk about access control policies for\na while.\n\n483\n00:24:32.195 --> 00:24:35.682\nWe'll create some objects,\ncreate some access control policies, and\n\n484\n00:24:35.682 --> 00:24:39.410\none of the rules we'll put in, we'll\nadd our file policy and our IPS policy.\n\n485\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.841\nOkay, so this is gonna take a couple\nminutes to work in the background,\n\n486\n00:24:42.841 --> 00:24:44.570\ncreating our IPS policy.\n\n487\n00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:49.050\nAgain, all we've done, and this is all you\nhave to do to start, choose a base policy.\n\n488\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:53.000\nWe did have that shared layer in there,\nbut we're not really using it.\n\n489\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.140\nWe can create that but nonetheless, this\nwould be a great policy to start with.\n\n490\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.304\nAnd then we'll just tweak it from there,\nand decide what we wanna turn on,\n\n491\n00:25:00.304 --> 00:25:02.476\nturn off based on the events we get for\nour network.\n\n492\n00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:06.966\nAnd FireSIGHT's gonna be really\nhelpful in helping us find\n\n493\n00:25:06.966 --> 00:25:10.340\nthe correct tuning for IPS policies.\n\n494\n00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.330\n>> And thankfully, with the centralized\nmanagement, once we get the policy created\n\n495\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.018\nthe way we want,\nwe can apply it to more than one device.\n\n496\n00:25:17.018 --> 00:25:19.840\nSo it's not like we're having to\nreinvent the wheel every time, right?\n\n497\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.362\nIf I work for an organization that has 100\nbranch offices, the odds are I'm gonna\n\n498\n00:25:23.362 --> 00:25:26.950\nhave similar needs at every single branch,\nso we can just reuse that policy right?\n\n499\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.450\n>> Absolutely, yes.\n\n500\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.030\nSo this is great, and then so\nmy policy's done, but it's like,\n\n501\n00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.350\nhey I'm not doing anything just\nlike when we saw our fire policy.\n\n502\n00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.845\nNo access control\npolicies use this policy.\n\n503\n00:25:37.845 --> 00:25:41.675\nSo I'm ready to go out, push an IPS\npolicy, I don't have to do the FireSIGHT,\n\n504\n00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:44.045\nright, I don't need to do that at all.\n\n505\n00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:47.505\nBut we will, you'll wanna do that,\nand we'll do it once we come back and\n\n506\n00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:48.885\ndo our network discovery.\n\n507\n00:25:48.885 --> 00:25:53.122\nAll right, so the next section will\nprobably broken into two sections,\n\n508\n00:25:53.122 --> 00:25:56.520\ncuz access control policies are all so\nimportant.\n\n509\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.327\nWe're gonna put, again,\nour file policy, IPS policy,\n\n510\n00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:01.800\nput those in our access control policy.\n\n511\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.400\nThen we're gonna go through our\nnetwork discovery and create that, and\n\n512\n00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.500\nthen we have to reapply\nour IPS policy again.\n\n513\n00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.310\nSo I know that I was saying,\nhey let's do this first, and then this,\n\n514\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.600\nthen we put our access control policy.\n\n515\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.500\nWe'd actually be up and running and\nstopping attacks, right?\n\n516\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.460\nAnd then really we need\nto let FireSIGHT run for\n\n517\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.400\na while on our network to get\nsome quality FireSIGHT data.\n\n518\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.270\nAll right, so I'm set for right now, and\n\n519\n00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.870\nthen we'll get to access control\npolicies and implement something.\n\n520\n00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:28.397\n>> Excellent.\n\n521\n00:26:28.397 --> 00:26:29.870\nNow the IPS policy is really important.\n\n522\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.162\nIt's where you're gonna spend a lot of\nyour time in getting this configured.\n\n523\n00:26:32.162 --> 00:26:34.049\nIt is, basically,\nthe main part that you pay for\n\n524\n00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:37.380\nwhen you're deploying FirePOWER in\nyour network, so really important.\n\n525\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.029\nThe other parts are important also, so\nwe still have those things to wrap up, so\n\n526\n00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:44.352\ndefinitely stay tuned, cuz we've got\nmore with FirePOWER coming up and\n\n527\n00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:46.878\njust more with\nCisco ASA Express Security in general.\n\n528\n00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:48.450\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed watching it.\n\n529\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.951\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n530\n00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:59.750\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.899\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV and\n\n4\n00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:23.580\nI'm your host Don Back again with another\noperation of Cisco ASA Express Security,\n\n5\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.721\nand in this episode, we're going to be\ntaking a look at access control policies.\n\n6\n00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.141\nNow, I know we've talked about\na lot of policies at this point,\n\n7\n00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:33.940\nIPS policies and the other ones,\nbut they are all important.\n\n8\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.960\nThey are things that we definitely need,\nbut\n\n9\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.640\nan access control policy is kind of\na critical piece of securing your network\n\n10\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.370\nand definitely one that we\nwant to take advantage of.\n\n11\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.740\nAnd here to help us with that,\nwe've got Todd Lammle back in the studio.\n\n12\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.610\nAnd Todd,\nlet's talk about some access control.\n\n13\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.160\n>> Okay, so I think I've mentioned\naccess control policies quite a bit and\n\n14\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.460\nhow important they are to this product\nis why we can't run it without,\n\n15\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.640\nso we need at least\nan access control policy.\n\n16\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.770\nBut if you've been following along,\nfirst off, we had to configure the ASA.\n\n17\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.630\nWe did some IP addresses and so on.\n\n18\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.640\nBut we also created our class map,\nput that into our global policy,\n\n19\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.970\nput that into our service policy.\n\n20\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.360\nAnd then, so we got that ready to go.\n\n21\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480\nInstalled the FirePOWER module,\nor configured it.\n\n22\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.380\nIt was already installed, configured it.\n\n23\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.880\nAnd then, what have we done?\n\n24\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.320\nWe've created our system and help policy.\n\n25\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500\nAnd some of those things that we wouldn't\ntouch on a day to day basis, but\n\n26\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.960\nthe other things that we started\nwith was the file policy.\n\n27\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.120\nWe did a basic IPS policy that we can\ntweak, and that's pretty much a lot,\n\n28\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.170\nwhat we'll do on a day to day basic,\ncome in look in at events and tweak that.\n\n29\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.330\nBut we can't do that until we create\nan access control policy, and\n\n30\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.820\nput that IPS policy.\n\n31\n00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.550\nIn the axis control policy, right?\n\n32\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.680\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntalk about an access control policy.\n\n33\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.380\nSo, I don't know how long\nthis section will be.\n\n34\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.060\nAt this point, but I might possibly\nbreak this into two sections.\n\n35\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.217\nSo let's go ahead and\ndive right in to access control policies,\n\n36\n00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.505\nand what they're going to do for\nour product.\n\n37\n00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:02.861\nAll right, so\n\n38\n00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:06.790\nwe know we can't live without them\n[LAUGH] if we're trying to do FirePOWER.\n\n39\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.980\nCan't live without you.\n\n40\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.150\nThere's a default access control and\nthis was the one that automatically got,\n\n41\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.430\nremember when we installed, or\nconfigured, it wasn't installed.\n\n42\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.479\nWhen we configured the FirePOWER module\nit said, applying access control,\n\n43\n00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.296\ndefault access control, right?\n\n44\n00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.687\nAnd it was permitting traffic,\nso it wasn't doing anything,\n\n45\n00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.860\nit's a pretty worthless\naccess control list.\n\n46\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.060\nNot even gonna use it,\nI'm just gonna leave it there.\n\n47\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.940\nOkay, I'm gonna say new policy.\n\n48\n00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.970\nNotice, I have some quick jump\nlinks here to object manage in.\n\n49\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.821\nAnd actually before, I wanted to mention\nthis, before I actually run over\n\n50\n00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:42.837\nhere to the access control policy,\nI wanna take a quick look at some objects.\n\n51\n00:02:42.837 --> 00:02:44.629\nSo I'm gonna go over\nhere with some objects.\n\n52\n00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.660\nA lot of times when I'm in a new network,\nI'm gonna go out and create objects.\n\n53\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.630\nNew network objects, right?\n\n54\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.490\nSo these network objects then,\ncan be used in the access control policy.\n\n55\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.910\nDon't have to do this, I can create them\nright within the access control policy,\n\n56\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.220\nbut we'll take a quick look.\n\n57\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.940\nAll right, so in here I have some\nindividual objects and object groups.\n\n58\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.350\nAnd I'll go into a customer and I'll\ncreate objects for each of their networks.\n\n59\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.045\nI'd say like sales, VLAN.\n\n60\n00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.422\nAnd these don't do anything by themselves.\n\n61\n00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:17.480\nAnd I'll say there, so\n172.16.10.0/24 network.\n\n62\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.046\nI can actually, put in another IP address,\nhave multiple IP addresses in this object.\n\n63\n00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:26.100\nSo I'm gonna go through and\nI'm gonna create an object.\n\n64\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.292\nOne of the things that, at a minimal,\nI'd recommend that you do,\n\n65\n00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:37.318\nand again, you can do this from the ACP\nitself, but I'm gonna come in here and\n\n66\n00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:42.837\nsay RFC_1918, okay, 172.16.0.0/12, right.\n\n67\n00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:51.046\n192.168.0.0/, oops 192.168.0.0/16.\n\n68\n00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:54.504\nAnd then, we've got our 10.0.0.0/8.\n\n69\n00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:57.089\nOkay, I'm pretty sure you guys\nare all aware what those are.\n\n70\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo, now I have an object that I can\nuse in a lot of different places.\n\n71\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.800\nSo create this.\n\n72\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.470\nBut if that's the only reason you're\ncoming in this object screen,\n\n73\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.400\nit's not necessary.\n\n74\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.500\nYou can do that again.\n\n75\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.420\nBut I do want to say you will\ncome in this office screen for\n\n76\n00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.490\npossibly this next one and\nthis is in security intelligence, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.962\nThis is my white and black list of IP's.\n\n78\n00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:23.918\nYesterday, I mentioned when we were going\nthrough the file policy, the white and\n\n79\n00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:24.980\nblack of files.\n\n80\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.490\nThis is the white and black list of IP's.\n\n81\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.730\nSo we can see there's a global\nblack list and a global white list.\n\n82\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.100\nNow, how do you get to\nsomething list this?\n\n83\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.460\nWell, you'd actually go into some\nevent and now a connection of events.\n\n84\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.330\nAnd you can right-click.\n\n85\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.385\nSo I'll see my connection events or\nintrusion events.\n\n86\n00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.750\nRight-click and\nblacklist an IP address from here.\n\n87\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.970\nThat's how you actually do it.\n\n88\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.000\nSo I just right-click this guys here,\nsay blacklist now, and\n\n89\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330\nhe'll end up inside this global blacklist.\n\n90\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.650\nI see him in there,\nI can't add anything in here from in here.\n\n91\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.810\nSo, really, most of the stuff that I do\non day-to-day basis, is from the events.\n\n92\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.270\nI tune my IPS policies,\nI create global white and black lists.\n\n93\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.450\nI create file white black,\njust really the show of the hash, right?\n\n94\n00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.925\nBut, we are a custom clean list and\nso on for our files.\n\n95\n00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:15.270\nNone-the-less, so\nthat's where our security intelligence.\n\n96\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.550\nNow, why am I showing you this?\n\n97\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.826\nBecause you can add some\nsecurity intelligence and say,\n\n98\n00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:23.421\nI'm gonna get a list from the FBI.\n\n99\n00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:28.110\nYou know, FBI weekly list and\nI know people that do this.\n\n100\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.840\nAnd then, they upload the list.\n\n101\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.170\nAnd you know what's kind of weird here,\nso check this out.\n\n102\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.460\nThis is really hard to see,\nwell how do I upload the list?\n\n103\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.680\nClick this little thing over here.\n\n104\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.940\n[INAUDIBLE] right?\n\n105\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.110\nAnd then you can choose your file,\nif you can click it, right.\n\n106\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.730\nThere it is.\n\n107\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.070\nAnd then, you choose your file and\nthen it uploads that list.\n\n108\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.430\nSo you get the file from the FBI or\nwherever it is, and\n\n109\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.840\nyou can put that in here and it's\nautomatically added to your blacklist.\n\n110\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.118\nBe careful my friends, because if you go\nout there and you search for blacklists,\n\n111\n00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:54.796\nyou are gonna find a whole bunch of lists.\n\n112\n00:05:54.796 --> 00:05:58.711\nAnd a lot of these people are up to\nno good, shenanigans, so be very,\n\n113\n00:05:58.711 --> 00:05:59.600\nvery careful.\n\n114\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.920\nThat being said, I also can do a feed and\ndo an URL feed and\n\n115\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.700\nget an MD5 on it, so we can get the actual\nfeed and get updated blacklist.\n\n116\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.350\nSo this is kinda nice, because basically\nwe have a blacklist that's updated.\n\n117\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.070\nYou know, this is an object that's in\nmy access control policy by default.\n\n118\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.980\nAnd it's updated automatically,\nevery two hours.\n\n119\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.890\nI don't have to do anything for\nthat, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.790\nSo if I look at this source fire\nintelligence feed, which obviously using.\n\n121\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.920\nAnd you could see that really, all I can\ndo is change this time that's updated.\n\n122\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.880\nI would just leave it alone and\nI'll update it every two hours, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.710\nMost of the other stuffs I'm gonna\nskip down because we're gonna do this\n\n124\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.780\nwith the access control policy.\n\n125\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.020\nBut I do come up here and create\na few network objects to start with,\n\n126\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.610\njust to give me some foundation, and\nthen if I have to play with the white and\n\n127\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.470\nblack list.\n\n128\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.440\nI would add something in here or\ntake them out.\n\n129\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.420\nRight, they're gonna be put\nin here from the events.\n\n130\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.180\nI'd have to come in here to\ntake them out of the object.\n\n131\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.680\nOkay.\n\n132\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.080\nSo down here we've got URL file list.\n\n133\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.990\nSo there's one thing that's kinda unique\nin here and that's in the sense of.\n\n134\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.100\nSo again, I can create URL lists,\napplication filters, and so on.\n\n135\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.680\nBut again, I'm gonna show you how to\ndo that in the access control policy.\n\n136\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.670\nBut in this case here,\nI wanna click on the variable set.\n\n137\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.470\nAnd this is actually something we use for\nour rules.\n\n138\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.850\nSo if I was to look inside\nhere we'll see that,\n\n139\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.130\nwe can customize these\ndifferent default variables.\n\n140\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.670\nAnd if you look at a snort rule,\n\n141\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.880\nthese are the default variables\nthat are used in all your rules.\n\n142\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.320\nNow, so if I come here and\n\n143\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.780\ntick my home net, which is supposed to be\nyour internal network, and I change this.\n\n144\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.220\nAnd I manipulate it and\ndon't put in my internal networks,\n\n145\n00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.680\nright now it's set to any.\n\n146\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840\nBut if I go in and put my internal\nnetworks in, then that's fine.\n\n147\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.581\nBut if I make a mistake, then what's\nhappening is I'm not actually seeing any\n\n148\n00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:54.108\nattacks, they're gonna not show me\ncuz it's not for the right network.\n\n149\n00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:56.467\nSo, if you're gonna play\nwith these variables,\n\n150\n00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:00.354\nbe very careful cuz you can make it, so\nyour snort rules don't alert on anything.\n\n151\n00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:04.824\nSo just understand that this default set,\nyou typically just leave this alone but\n\n152\n00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:06.270\nyou don't have to.\n\n153\n00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.570\nA lot of people go under\ntheir home net and\n\n154\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.630\nput their internal networks in there,\njust make sure you put the right ones in.\n\n155\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.520\nIn this case here if you're just using the\nRFC 1918 just put that object in here now\n\n156\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.270\nthat I created and you're done.\n\n157\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.730\nAnd that's typically\nwhat a lot of people do.\n\n158\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.150\nThe other thing I wanna mention cuz\nwe talked about this yesterday,\n\n159\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.030\nwas the geo location objects.\n\n160\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.230\nWe talked about the updates when\nwe went to the update page.\n\n161\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.390\nAnd this is where those objects are.\n\n162\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.300\nSo now, again,\nI don't have to create this here.\n\n163\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.400\nI'm gonna go to the axis control.\n\n164\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.250\nBut if I look at this, I'm gonna look\nat all the different countries and\n\n165\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.425\ncontinents that I can choose.\n\n166\n00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:41.510\nSo Africa has got,\nI'm sure you're all aware,\n\n167\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.140\nI don't know how many countries they have,\nlike 200?\n\n168\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.690\nSo anyways, there's a lot in here and\nI can choose, well,\n\n169\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.514\nI don't get new business from them.\n\n170\n00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:53.271\nMaybe I'm not get anything from,\n\n171\n00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.370\nwe can take a look at agencies,\nsome stuff in here.\n\n172\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.277\nSo you can pick out what you consider bad\ncountries or some that you wanna block or\n\n173\n00:09:01.277 --> 00:09:02.693\nsome that you wanna permit.\n\n174\n00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:06.940\nAnd you can do it from here, create the\nobjects and use an access control policy.\n\n175\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.114\nBut again, this is done also easily\nfrom you access control policy itself.\n\n176\n00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:15.130\nSo let's run back over to\nour access control policy.\n\n177\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.555\nAnd I do have a couple network objects and\n\n178\n00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:21.946\nagain at a minimum that's probably\nsomething you're gonna wanna do.\n\n179\n00:09:21.946 --> 00:09:28.249\nSo let's go back over here to policies\naccess control, now that I created that.\n\n180\n00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:30.352\nSo here's my access control policy.\n\n181\n00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:34.700\nI wanna create a new policy, not gonna\nuse the default, just leave it there.\n\n182\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.624\nIf you delete it, it shows back up,\nso [LAUGH] can't get rid of it.\n\n183\n00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:45.190\n[LAUGH] Anyways, here's my access control\npolicy, here's my managed device.\n\n184\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.740\nSo it's saying okay, Todds ACP and\nyou add a default action at the end.\n\n185\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.710\nSo at the end of your access\ncontrol pulsing what's it gonna do?\n\n186\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.415\nSo I can set to say if you get all\nthe way, if your file or your packet,\n\n187\n00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:01.640\nyou get all the way through my access\ncontrol policy and you get through my file\n\n188\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.230\npolicy, my IPS policy and all my other\nrules, then we're gonna kill you.\n\n189\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.860\nSo [LAUGH] basically what that\nsays is block all traffic.\n\n190\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.860\nAnd maybe that's what you want.\n\n191\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.110\nAnd a lot of times I\nleave it like that and\n\n192\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.260\nthen I know that I'm exclusively\npermitting everything.\n\n193\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.920\nSo think of it kind of\nlike an access list.\n\n194\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.960\nIn this case here, we can also set\nit to go through a SNORT rule.\n\n195\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.140\nAnd that's typically what\nI'll do on customers.\n\n196\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.530\nWhen I'm in a class or something,\nI have them block all rules.\n\n197\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.040\nI'm gonna leave this right here alone for\nright now.\n\n198\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.085\nAnd we're gonna create,\nI'll just go ahead and block all traffic.\n\n199\n00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.270\nSo a couple of things we're\ngonna look at right away.\n\n200\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.180\nSo I'll come over here and\nwe'll see the whole page.\n\n201\n00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.680\nAnd at the bottom down here,\nI'm gonna see my default action.\n\n202\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.930\nSo again, this is after everything\ncomes in, what happens?\n\n203\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.850\nThe guy's taking this, checking this out.\n\n204\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:54.420\nSo as a file comes in, it comes through,\nhits the security intelligence.\n\n205\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.720\nThat's my white and black list.\n\n206\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.103\nThen, it goes through my rules\nthen it hits my default action.\n\n207\n00:11:00.103 --> 00:11:03.788\nI'm gonna change that so if you're like\nthat's not what happens like I know, I\n\n208\n00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:08.120\nknow, but that's how it used to happen and\nso let's talk about that for one second.\n\n209\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.700\nWe come in,\ngo through security intelligence,\n\n210\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.580\ngo through the rules,\nhit my default action.\n\n211\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.200\nSo I wanna set this default\naction up first and\n\n212\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.430\nthen I'm, first off, the other thing\nI want you to always be thinking\n\n213\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.760\nabout when you're creating\nyour ACP is logging.\n\n214\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.757\nSo we're not logging anything by default,\nno rules, anything like that.\n\n215\n00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:27.867\nSo I'm gonna come over here to the scroll\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n216\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.690\nAnd I click on this and I'm gonna say log.\n\n217\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.630\nSince it's a block it only allows me to\nlog at the beginning, there's no eon.\n\n218\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.707\nNow, I can send this to the sys-log or\nSNP trap or\n\n219\n00:11:41.707 --> 00:11:45.199\nto our defense and I'm just gonna say OK.\n\n220\n00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:48.186\nSo now I'm logging this,\nI could just go up and apply this but\n\n221\n00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.320\nI'm just blocking everything.\n\n222\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.890\nSo we'll come back to that.\n\n223\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.190\nNow, before I go ahead and create rules,\nI got my default actions set and\n\n224\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.380\nI'm logging.\n\n225\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.465\nAlways think about logging\nno matter what you do.\n\n226\n00:11:57.465 --> 00:12:00.174\nBut let's take a look before\nwe create more rules,\n\n227\n00:12:00.174 --> 00:12:04.400\nI can create the target that it's gonna\ngo to, but I can choose that at any time.\n\n228\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.896\nSo if I had ten managed devices on here,\nthose would be listed in here,\n\n229\n00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:11.808\nI can take this ACP and\npush it out for all ten.\n\n230\n00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:13.800\nNow, I've got security intelligence.\n\n231\n00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.440\nThis is my white and black list.\n\n232\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.460\nSo here's my global white and black list,\nthat was in my security and objects,\n\n233\n00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.350\nwhen I went to the objects, here they are.\n\n234\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.662\nSo we can't see what's in them from here,\nbut we can go to objects and\n\n235\n00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.447\nsee if there's something in there.\n\n236\n00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:30.917\nNow, if I am in objects, and I go out and\nthere was something in the black list,\n\n237\n00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.652\nI right click, put something in\nthe black list for my events,\n\n238\n00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:38.050\nit immediately takes effect, I don't\nhave to update my access control policy.\n\n239\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.079\nHowever, if I go back into my objects and\ntake it out of there,\n\n240\n00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:44.657\nthen to make it take effect I'd have\nto update my access control policy.\n\n241\n00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:46.920\nThat's just kinda the way it works.\n\n242\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.000\nNow, global white and\nblack list, that's fine,\n\n243\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.710\nthese are some Cisco-authored objects for\n\n244\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.320\nsecurity intelligence, so I'm just\ngonna come down and choose all of them,\n\n245\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.660\nall the way down to this tour exit note,\nsee if it takes it, add to black list.\n\n246\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.150\nNotice here's my global white and\nblack list, leave those alone.\n\n247\n00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.830\nAnd then the objects that I would create.\n\n248\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.988\nI'd probably have a lot of objects in\nhere, in the sense of for my network, but\n\n249\n00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:12.209\nin this case, and the reason that I would\ndo those and why I created those because\n\n250\n00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:16.470\nI'm gonna choose these here and\nI'm gonna put them into the white list.\n\n251\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.810\nWhy?\n\n252\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.680\nBecause the white list only exists\nto override the black list.\n\n253\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.510\nSo for example, if someone screws up and\nthey click on sales VLAN, or marketing,\n\n254\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.370\nwhatever your objects are, and add that to\nthe black list, look what happens to it.\n\n255\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.340\nIt's being overridden by the white list.\n\n256\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.910\nThat's why we have the white list,\nto override the black list.\n\n257\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.218\nI'm gonna take that out.\n\n258\n00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:40.700\nI'm gonna leave these in here.\n\n259\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.730\nCisco updates, this is really nice.\n\n260\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.390\nThere's other objects I can go out and\nget from the public.\n\n261\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.910\nSome other tour sites there's some people\nthat say, I've got better objects, but\n\n262\n00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.010\nagain be careful.\n\n263\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.870\nBut nonetheless add them in here.\n\n264\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.040\nThey're updated automatically, and\n\n265\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.780\nwhen these are updated you don't have\nto update your access control policy.\n\n266\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.570\nThe objects are already in there and we're\njust adding the IPs in here, very cool.\n\n267\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.720\nNow, there's something we're missing.\n\n268\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.460\nWhat did I tell you we need to think\nabout every time we create a rule?\n\n269\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.957\nLogging.\n[LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:14:08.957 --> 00:14:11.600\n>> You got me on that one I'm like-\n\n271\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.920\n>> John said that but his mic was off.\n\n272\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.080\nHe was saying logging, logging, logging.\n\n273\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.350\nSo basically we gotta go over here and\nwe click on this and\n\n274\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.320\nif something is hit by the black\nlist I wanna know if it's blocked.\n\n275\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.230\nBecause theoretically, right now, as we're\ngoing through this, everything comes and\n\n276\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.690\nhits security intelligence first, and if\nit's blacklisted it's immediately dropped.\n\n277\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.570\nIf it's not, then it goes to the ACP.\n\n278\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.824\nAnd if it gets through the ACP\nit hits the default action.\n\n279\n00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:39.090\nSo we're gonna click this here.\n\n280\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.010\nI'm gonna say Log Connections and\nlog this so\n\n281\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.370\nif something gets hit by the blac klist.\n\n282\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.120\nNotice with the white list we\ndon't get any log because it goes\n\n283\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.920\nnow to the access control policy.\n\n284\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.018\nIn this case here we kill it.\n\n285\n00:14:52.018 --> 00:14:54.098\nIt's dead.\n\n286\n00:14:54.098 --> 00:14:57.663\nD-E-A-D.\n\n287\n00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.540\nNow, we're gonna create some rules.\n\n288\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.490\nAnd a lot of rules we create in our\naccess control policy are things\n\n289\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.500\nlike I don't know block Facebook seems to\nbe a lot of stuff that I do, social media.\n\n290\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.826\nPeople are like I don't want\nany social media on my network.\n\n291\n00:15:11.826 --> 00:15:17.070\nNow, so the thing is I can go out and\nblock social media, that's fine.\n\n292\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.110\nBut if I don't tell the users\nthat I'm blocking them\n\n293\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.930\nbecause of a security policy by\nthe manager, then they're gonna call me.\n\n294\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.250\nOr they're gonna call\nthe network manager..\n\n295\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.490\nCuz they're gonna get a bad experience,\nthey're gonna get a 404 error or whatever.\n\n296\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.840\nSo what we wanna do is give\nthe user a good experience and\n\n297\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.220\nsay, hey, we created this rule,\ndon't shoot the messenger.\n\n298\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.010\nThe boss set it,\nno sense in giving me a call.\n\n299\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.970\nYou're going to a place that\nyou're not supposed to.\n\n300\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.166\nTypically they know they're\nnot supposed to go there,\n\n301\n00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:44.044\nbut we're gonna make\nsure they don't call us.\n\n302\n00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:47.300\nSo the way I'm gonna do that is\nto go to the HVP responses and\n\n303\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.638\nI'm gonna go to the Block Response Page.\n\n304\n00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:54.084\nSo if I just block this, and\nI'm not ever letting them go out there,\n\n305\n00:15:54.084 --> 00:15:58.920\nI wanna give them a message that says,\nI'll give them a custom message and\n\n306\n00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.444\nThis is saying hey, you're attempting\nto access a forbidden site,\n\n307\n00:16:03.444 --> 00:16:07.130\nconsult your system administrator for\ndetails.\n\n308\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.950\nThey're not gonna call you, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.800\nSo, things like that,\nwe're gonna put that in here.\n\n310\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.220\nBut, notice now they\nhave another response.\n\n311\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.722\nBecause if they go out to Facebook,\nor whatever it is, and\n\n312\n00:16:17.722 --> 00:16:19.109\nthey can't get there a 404.\n\n313\n00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:21.360\nThey're not sure if it's just forbidden.\n\n314\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.362\nThey know they're not supposed to,\nbut that's why it's being blocked,\n\n315\n00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:33.580\nor they can call you and get it fixed,\nand the fact is you tell them they can't.\n\n316\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.388\nThe other thing is, there's something\ncalled an interactive block.\n\n317\n00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:40.340\nNow, this is really good,\nthis is a very good URL filter.\n\n318\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.370\nI've seen some other\ncompanies that have some\n\n319\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.180\nURL filters that are gonna give us\nthis response, but in this sense here,\n\n320\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.695\none of the things that Cisco can't do that\nsome other competitors that I've seen is.\n\n321\n00:16:51.695 --> 00:16:56.046\nIf let's say, you're a network manager or\nwhatever, and you wanna go out to a site,\n\n322\n00:16:56.046 --> 00:16:58.719\nwell we block everything\nthat's not work related.\n\n323\n00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:02.112\nWell, if you're the administrator,\nit could prompt you for a password and\n\n324\n00:17:02.112 --> 00:17:05.640\nthen you can type in that password and\noverride it and get to that site.\n\n325\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.820\nWe can't do that with Fire Power,\nall right.\n\n326\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.650\nSo, with some competitors, I've seen that.\n\n327\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.890\nHowever, what we can do is say,\nokay, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n328\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.620\nwe'll just make this system provided.\n\n329\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:21.610\nBut what this says is you can go out\nto the site, so your attempting this.\n\n330\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.990\nYou may continue to the site,\nbut we're logging you.\n\n331\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.060\nAnd then by default after 10 minutes\nwe're gonna go ahead and deny it and\n\n332\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.990\nstop the site.\n\n333\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.350\nRight?\nWe're gonna block it.\n\n334\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.250\nNow can they come back in and\ndo it for another 10 minutes?\n\n335\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.200\nSure they can, but\nyou're logging this all the time, and\n\n336\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.420\nyou're telling them I'm logging you,\nright.\n\n337\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.730\nSo, why would you do something like this?\n\n338\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.160\nWell, there are some sites and say hey\nyou can't go to the social media but\n\n339\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.650\nmaybe the union comes back to us.\n\n340\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.560\nAnd there are bright thing\nto do whatever they want.\n\n341\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.680\nYou say that's fine, I can change\nthis time out to 15 minutes and\n\n342\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.380\nthen they can go out in\nthere whatever Facebook and\n\n343\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.150\nthen after 15 minutes it just\nblocks them and denies them, right?\n\n344\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.040\nAnd if they go back again after that,\n\n345\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.680\nobviously you'll be\nalerted you can stop it.\n\n346\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.700\nBut, nonetheless we, this is the way\nthat we would be able to stop sites.\n\n347\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.130\nWe either stop them completely, or\nallow them to go through and then deny it.\n\n348\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.520\nThere's no overrides or\nanything like that.\n\n349\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.390\nOkay, so this isn't a bad thing,\nthis is a good thing.\n\n350\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.640\nRight now, the advance screen,\nunfortunately guys,\n\n351\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.950\nI wanna talk to you about this.\n\n352\n00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.630\nThis advanced screen here,\n\n353\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.920\nis probably the most advanced\nscreen on the Fire Power product.\n\n354\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.670\nRight, so, you might not think\nthat after you saw the IPS but\n\n355\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.180\nlet's take a look here at\nsome general settings.\n\n356\n00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.496\nAll right, so a lot of this is from 5\n3 code, right, and a change in 5 4 and\n\n357\n00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:35.178\n6 0 code.\n\n358\n00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:40.050\nBut nonetheless, we can take a look and\nsee some of the settings here.\n\n359\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.274\nMaximum URL character store in connection,\nso when I get a connection and\n\n360\n00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:46.238\nthen someone goes somewhere,\nI actually see the URL where they go.\n\n361\n00:18:46.238 --> 00:18:50.213\nAnd what we're saying here is we wanna see\n1024 characters that's a pretty big URL\n\n362\n00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:50.930\nstring right?\n\n363\n00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.870\nBut, someone would get pretty long, the\nother one is the interactive block, right?\n\n364\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.860\n600 seconds,\nthat's ten minutes by default.\n\n365\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.458\nNow, it's a little bit more tricky here,\nthat's pretty easy, so I can change this\n\n366\n00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:07.618\nto 900 seconds or whatever and\ngo 15 minutes, whatever that is.\n\n367\n00:19:07.618 --> 00:19:08.427\nSo, I can sit there and\n\n368\n00:19:08.427 --> 00:19:11.890\nsay, okay, they get interactive block and\nafter 15 minutes they're fine.\n\n369\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.650\nNow this is SSL policy use for\ninspecting encrypted connections.\n\n370\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.878\nNow, we're not creating SSL\npolicies in this class.\n\n371\n00:19:19.878 --> 00:19:24.710\nWe'll do that actually in our next update,\nwe're gonna be doing that.\n\n372\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.800\nSo, there is a policy we can create for,\nhow we take the certificate off,\n\n373\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.690\nread the data and\nput the certificate back on.\n\n374\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.400\nSo, that's where this\npolicy will be listed.\n\n375\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.988\nNow, check this out, this is now\nthe decision you guys gotta make.\n\n376\n00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:40.969\nInspect traffic during policy apply, this\noption is disabled, the FirePOWER module\n\n377\n00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:44.199\ntargeted by this policy may disrupt\nnetwork traffic until complete.\n\n378\n00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:47.945\nSo, now what we're saying, if we click\nthis on, and this is the default is,\n\n379\n00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:50.780\nyou're pushing out your\nAccess Control policy.\n\n380\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.110\nWhen you're updating your access control\npolicies, traffics not unexpected.\n\n381\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.600\nIt's coming through.\n\n382\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.588\nI mean, I've tested this multiple times.\n\n383\n00:19:58.588 --> 00:20:02.800\nI'm sitting there pinging through\nthe ASA where I blocked ICMP.\n\n384\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.108\nOn here,\nI've blocked whatever I was trying to do.\n\n385\n00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:08.966\nAnd I'm sitting there, I can tell when the\naccess control policy's done because now\n\n386\n00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:11.410\nmy traffic starts to go through.\n\n387\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.380\nThat was because I had this unchecked.\n\n388\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.150\nSo, that's what it says,\n\n389\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.510\nif this option's disabled, it may disrupt\ntraffic because what we're saying is,\n\n390\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.160\nwe're not letting any traffic through\nuninspected if we uncheck this.\n\n391\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.310\nAnd that's maybe not what you wanna do.\n\n392\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.140\nSo, how long does it take to\nupdate an access control policy?\n\n393\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.430\nI can't really answer that question.\n\n394\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.810\nIt depends on what hardware you have.\n\n395\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.277\nIf you have an appliance,\n\n396\n00:20:32.277 --> 00:20:36.688\nit would be a lot shorter period of time\nthan if you had an ASA, even a 5585.\n\n397\n00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:40.076\nAnd then it also depends on the length and\nthe size and\n\n398\n00:20:40.076 --> 00:20:43.006\nwhat you have in your\naccess control policy.\n\n399\n00:20:43.006 --> 00:20:46.652\nSo, we'll take a look at some really\nadvanced access control policies in this\n\n400\n00:20:46.652 --> 00:20:48.820\nsection and\nthose would take a while to apply.\n\n401\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.880\nI mean,\nI've seen them take ten minutes or more.\n\n402\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.380\nAnd your network is down.\n\n403\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.270\nSo again, and I'm not gonna give you\nan exact number for your network,\n\n404\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.870\nbecause that's gonna depend\non the appliance, the ASA,\n\n405\n00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.830\nor the access control\npolicy that you have.\n\n406\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.780\nSo, now you're making another decision.\n\n407\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.870\nThese are the things,\nI don't tell you what to do.\n\n408\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.460\nJust tell you this is something\nyou wanna keep in mind.\n\n409\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.460\nWhat this is saying, by default,\nwe're gonna let traffic through while\n\n410\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.350\nthe access control policy is being applied\nand not drop traffic and not inspect it.\n\n411\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.850\nYour choice.\n\n412\n00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.020\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna leave that all as default and\n\n413\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.730\nthen move back to network\nanalysis intrusion policy.\n\n414\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.700\nThis is again kinda new in the five four.\n\n415\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.800\nNo, it's completely new, not kinda new.\n\n416\n00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.220\nBasically, this one's kinda tricky.\n\n417\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.260\nI've seen some errors with this, so\n\n418\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.090\nwhen you're doing an Access Control\npolicy you have to pay attention to this.\n\n419\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.150\nBecause it's hard to find, the Access\nControl policy will give you an error if\n\n420\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.260\nthis isn't configured correct, and\nit doesn't tell you where the error is, so\n\n421\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.100\nyou have to really come in here and\nfind it.\n\n422\n00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:53.726\nNone the less it says, IPS policy used\nbefore access control rule is determined.\n\n423\n00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:59.690\nNow, this is kinda weird, so\nremember when I said a file comes in and\n\n424\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.690\nit goes through the security\nintelligence then it hits.\n\n425\n00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.625\nOur rules and it hits our base policy.\n\n426\n00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:12.090\nWere really what we're talking about is\nwe're gonna look at an IPS rule to use,\n\n427\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.181\nwhile all this is occurring before\nthe security intelligence, right.\n\n428\n00:22:15.181 --> 00:22:18.920\nSo, this is happening before\nsecurity intelligence.\n\n429\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.880\nOnce that's determined and we've\ndetermined what we're gonna do with it,\n\n430\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.520\nfor example if we determine the file type,\na lot of times we're transferring\n\n431\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.660\nthe file, and sending the file\nover will determine that file.\n\n432\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.420\nSo, that helps us with latency and so on.\n\n433\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.410\nBut in this case here,\nthis says No Rules Active.\n\n434\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.360\nAnd you may wanna leave it like that,\nbut I'm gonna show you that you can't\n\n435\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.380\nif you're gonna apply\na customized IPS policy.\n\n436\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.198\nNow that being said, you're not gonna\nhear anything from CISCO on that.\n\n437\n00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:48.750\nYou're not gonna get anything from,\ncalling them or anything like that.\n\n438\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.660\nSo, I'm gonna show you how this works.\n\n439\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.050\nNonetheless, I like to\nleave this off if I can.\n\n440\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.990\nI say, I don't need anymore overhead,\nI've got enough rules, I've got enough\n\n441\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:01.860\nIPS policies, I've got my security\nintelligence, my rules and my base policy.\n\n442\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.040\nI'm happy with it.\n\n443\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.890\nBut, we'll come back to this.\n\n444\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.550\nNow we can change the variable set\nthat we're using there as the default\n\n445\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.242\nvariable set.\n\n446\n00:23:10.242 --> 00:23:11.990\nI'm telling you,\n\n447\n00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.850\ndon't probably change that one\nunless you have Cisco on the phone.\n\n448\n00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:19.689\nThat variable set is talking about\nthe variables in your rules,\n\n449\n00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:22.240\nyou don't wanna screw that up.\n\n450\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.800\nAll right, so\nwe can see it's the default set.\n\n451\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.730\nProbably leave that alone.\n\n452\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.730\nAll right,\ndefault network analysis policy.\n\n453\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.890\nAll right, now we're not gonna\ncover that in this course, but\n\n454\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.410\nit was covered in our\nother fire power course.\n\n455\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:38.640\nThis is again our pre-processors, and\nthey're really configured over here and\n\n456\n00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.790\nthen obviously there's\na network analysis policy page.\n\n457\n00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.920\nSo, they took out the advanced section in\nthe IPS policy, when you're creating that.\n\n458\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.418\nCreated a new policy.\n\n459\n00:23:49.418 --> 00:23:53.036\nNot real sure why they did it, but\nthese are pretty smart people, so\n\n460\n00:23:53.036 --> 00:23:56.719\nI'm gonna have to go to them and\nsay they knew what they were doing, so\n\n461\n00:23:56.719 --> 00:23:58.578\nthumbs up to you guys, whatever.\n\n462\n00:23:58.578 --> 00:24:00.958\nI'm gonna leave this alone\nin this section here.\n\n463\n00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.778\nAll right.\n\n464\n00:24:02.778 --> 00:24:06.870\nAnd now we've got our file and\nmalware settings.\n\n465\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:13.290\nOkay, so, now what we have to do, see if I\ncan get back in here, get a little closer.\n\n466\n00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.100\nWhen we're gonna do\nfile type detection and\n\n467\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.610\nwe did file type detection,\nare you a PF, are you an XE?\n\n468\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.450\nHow far we gonna look in?\n\n469\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.090\nWell it's 416 bytes as I\nmentioned yesterday, all right.\n\n470\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.650\nAllow file if cloud look up for block\nmaleware takes longer than two seconds.\n\n471\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.170\nSo I think we looked for\nmalware in PDFs or something like that.\n\n472\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.090\nAllow them through but look for malware.\n\n473\n00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:34.910\nThat's a great example.\n\n474\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.690\nI think we did that in our file policy.\n\n475\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.290\nNonetheless so\n\n476\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.310\nif you go in there what it's gonna do\nis it's gonna hit your manage device.\n\n477\n00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:46.120\nIt's gonna send it to the defense center\nFMC, or whatever they're calling it today,\n\n478\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.960\nand then that's gonna send it to\nthe AMP cloud for file disposition.\n\n479\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.180\nAMP cloud's gonna send it back to the\ndefense center, it's gonna hold that file\n\n480\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.390\ndisposition, it's an hour if it's malware,\nfour hours if it's clean.\n\n481\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.680\nSo it, we kinda cache that disposition.\n\n482\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.240\nSend it to the manage device to tell it\nlet the file go or drop the file, right?\n\n483\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.860\nDepending on our file policy.\n\n484\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.050\nTwo seconds that's all you have, right?\n\n485\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.990\nSo we could sit there.\n\n486\n00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.650\nIt's going to, if takes longer than\ntwo seconds which when we're doing\n\n487\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.520\nfile type inspection it can, and so\nit's going to allow the file at first.\n\n488\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.990\nAnd then once it determines the file types\nit'll start blocking them, all right.\n\n489\n00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:26.670\nSo do not calculate values for\nfiles larger than 10 megs.\n\n490\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.240\nMalware doesn't really come in\nthat large of packages and so\n\n491\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.450\nthere's a couple things.\n\n492\n00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.060\nWe don't really have to worry about\nmalware in file larger than 10 megs and\n\n493\n00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:40.050\nthe other thing is we have to\nthink about latency, right?\n\n494\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.680\nWe do have to get some\npackage through this thing.\n\n495\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.210\nAnd the more stuff we put on the air\nthe better, so they're like don't do this.\n\n496\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.120\nNow, there's a couple other things\ndown here that's not showing up so\n\n497\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.620\nlet me see if I can get that working.\n\n498\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.920\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.930\nMaximum file size to store, so\nremember we stored, we transfer packets.\n\n500\n00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.650\nThese are our store.\n\n501\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.060\nAnd then for\nwhat we're gonna send dynamic analysis,\n\n502\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.920\nnow remember, when stuff gets sent out we,\nto Taos we're sending the shaw.\n\n503\n00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.020\nRight, we're just hey give me a file,\ndisposition of this file.\n\n504\n00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.140\nWe don't have very much time,\nwhat do you think?\n\n505\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.010\nWell when we send it to Dynamic Analysis\nit can take 20 minutes or\n\n506\n00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.800\nsomething like that,\ndepending on the file.\n\n507\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.107\nAnd the fact is is we're\nlimiting the file size,\n\n508\n00:26:14.107 --> 00:26:16.247\nso now we're actually\ngonna send the file and\n\n509\n00:26:16.247 --> 00:26:20.153\nnot the shaw on this case, and it's saying\nwe can send up to 20 megs, all right.\n\n510\n00:26:20.153 --> 00:26:23.626\nSo, I'm not gonna do this side in\nthis course, but let's go ahead and\n\n511\n00:26:23.626 --> 00:26:26.330\nwe've got the advance right here.\n\n512\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.580\nHTTP responses, security intelligence.\n\n513\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.810\nYou guys have to make\na couple decisions here.\n\n514\n00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.470\nAnd I'm gonna show you after we do our\nrules which is gonna be in the next\n\n515\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.420\nsection, because I'm not gonna start\nthe rules until the next section,\n\n516\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.650\nthat we're gonna have to change this,\nall right.\n\n517\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.230\nAnd I'll show you why and how.\n\n518\n00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.040\nSo what we're going to do is\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n519\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.840\nthis is a great place\nto stop this episode.\n\n520\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.390\nThis is like a precursor on what you\nwant to do with access control policies.\n\n521\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.920\nSet your base policy, go out and\nset your headings, security intelligence,\n\n522\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.720\nget your objects, create your objects,\nget your intelligence feeds and\n\n523\n00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.850\nthe most important thing in the objects at\nthis point was the security intelligence.\n\n524\n00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.940\nThe other thing, making a couple of\nnetwork objects for your network and\n\n525\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.960\nputting them in, fine, that's great.\n\n526\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.010\nAlso a couple of decisions\nyou have to make.\n\n527\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.370\nDo we want to look at data while we're\naccessing our access control policy, or\n\n528\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.050\nupdating our access control policy?\n\n529\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.200\nAre we stopping data from\ncoming through uninspected or\n\n530\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.720\nthe default is as you know\nallowing it to go through?\n\n531\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.740\nThat's a decision you guys have to make.\n\n532\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.000\nAll right,\nnow there were a ton of options in there.\n\n533\n00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.340\nBut fortunately there are default values\nset of all of it so you can get up and\n\n534\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.530\nrunning very, very quickly if you want and\n\n535\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.870\nthen slowly customize it over time to\nget to the way that you need it to be.\n\n536\n00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.680\nA lot of powerful options, thanks for\nwalking us through all that.\n\n537\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.410\nWe still have a little bit more\nof rule customization, but\n\n538\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.070\nyou're absolutely right that we're\nrunning low on time for this episode.\n\n539\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.730\nSo we're going to go ahead and stop here,\nbut stay tuned because we'll have\n\n540\n00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.340\nthe exciting conclusion to access control\npolicies where we set up the rules, and\n\n541\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.810\nget that deployed coming up next.\n\n542\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.020\nStay tuned for that.\n\n543\n00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.070\nFor now, signing off

00:00:17.358\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:18.778\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n5\n00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:22.278\nback again with another episode\nof Cisco ASA Express Security.\n\n6\n00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:24.692\nAnd, if you've been watching\nall of these in order,\n\n7\n00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:28.450\nyou know in the last episode we left off\ntalking about access control policies, and\n\n8\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.030\nwe saw a ton of options for\ngetting them set up.\n\n9\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.350\nBut there is one thing we didn't get to,\nand it's kind of an important thing, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.630\nthat's defining rules\ninside of the policies.\n\n11\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.605\nAnd so that's where we're gonna\npick up right here in part two,\n\n12\n00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.188\ngetting those rules in place and active,\nand seeing how that can kinda manage\n\n13\n00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.018\nthe traffic passing through\nour firepower enabled device.\n\n14\n00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:48.395\nAnd here to help us with that, we've got\nTodd Lammle back in the studio, and Todd,\n\n15\n00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:49.820\nlet me turn the floor over to you.\n\n16\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.600\n>> All right, great, so we took a look at\nsome of the options, the HTTP responses,\n\n17\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810\nsecurity intelligence,\nand the advanced tab.\n\n18\n00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.870\nYou've got some questions to answer,\ncan't answer them for you.\n\n19\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.750\nAll I can do is give you the options and\nyou gotta think about it, right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.040\nWe still haven't taken our IPS policy and\ndone the online, right,\n\n21\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.160\ncuz that's just the way that goes.\n\n22\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.370\nThat's what I would highly\nsuggest at this point.\n\n23\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.700\nSo we've got to add that,\nI'm not gonna try to forget that.\n\n24\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.140\nAnyways, the first thing we're gonna\nlook at here is where we add our rules.\n\n25\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.680\nThink of it as an access\ncontrol list in this fact that\n\n26\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.365\nas packets come in they\ngo from top to bottom.\n\n27\n00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:26.020\nNow we see something called\nAdministrator Rules, Standard Rules,\n\n28\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.730\nRoute Rules, and we can actually add\ncategories in here, and I'm gonna show you\n\n29\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.000\nsome advanced access control policies\nthat use some different ones.\n\n30\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.380\nAnd they're just for administrator,\nthey don't really mean anything,\n\n31\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.590\nnot one's more important than the other.\n\n32\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.610\nHowever, based on where they are they're\ngonna take precedent over the other,\n\n33\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.200\nthat's the only thing, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.350\nSo let's go ahead and say Add Rule,\nlet's create some rules.\n\n35\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.410\nShould block Facebook, [LAUGH] all right,\nbeen talking about that.\n\n36\n00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.850\nBut we can allow an allow rule,\nbut check this out,\n\n37\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.370\nlet's take a look at some different\noptions that we have here.\n\n38\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.650\nSo we have the Allow, now I'm gonna\ngo ahead and just do this one first.\n\n39\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.070\nIt doesn't matter because I'm gonna move\nthe rules around so they fit my needs.\n\n40\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.500\nSo I'm gonna say add file and IPS policy,\nright, it has to be an allow rule.\n\n41\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.108\nI'm not going to create, use any of these\nother tabs, but I am gonna do two things.\n\n42\n00:02:18.108 --> 00:02:21.129\nWhat is it we always keep in\nmind when we're creating a rule?\n\n43\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.390\nLogging, logging, right?\n\n44\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.645\nHe said it, his mic was off again.\n\n45\n00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so here's my logging, but\n\n46\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.600\nhere's how I add my file in IPS pulse,\nmy access control.\n\n47\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.240\nAnd I can create many rules\nwith different IPS policies and\n\n48\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.630\nfile policies,\ncan have dozens of them in here.\n\n49\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.010\nIt will give us some errors we'll take\na look at, so there's my IPS policy, so\n\n50\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.780\nI add my IPS policy in here,\nand once that goes out and\n\n51\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.350\nwe look at our connection events and\nour intrusion events, then we're\n\n52\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.870\ngonna tune those rules and then after we\nget that all tuned, then we'll go back.\n\n53\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.390\nSay drop one line, reapply our IPS policy,\n\n54\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.750\nreapply the access control policy,\nboom, boom.\n\n55\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.342\nOkay, so\nyou're going to have to do that again,\n\n56\n00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:05.471\ndon't do while in production when\nyou first create your IPS policy.\n\n57\n00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.758\nI mean you can,\nI'm just not recommending it.\n\n58\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:12.497\nNow we have these two set, remember here's\nour variable set, I recommend leaving\n\n59\n00:03:12.497 --> 00:03:16.850\nthat alone, we have our IPS policy,\nsorry in and out there real fast.\n\n60\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.410\nI put my policies in here, again,\nif I wanna add more policies,\n\n61\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.890\nI have to create another rule, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.960\nAnd then I'm gonna go to Logging, and\n\n63\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.160\nI can say log at the beginning and\nat the end.\n\n64\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.960\nIt depends on what you wanna do,\nsome people just log at the beginning and\n\n65\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.260\nthey get a connection event or\nan IPS event, whatever it is, but\n\n66\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.480\nin this case here I wanna get as many\nevents as possible cuz I'm looking at my\n\n67\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.650\nnetwork, and you can change this later.\n\n68\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.730\nAnd then, just remember,\n\n69\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.430\nif I make a change, I have to update my\naccess control policy for any change.\n\n70\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.330\nAll right, so now that I have\nthat in here, now remember,\n\n71\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.580\nthat's kinda right in the middle.\n\n72\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.920\nI'm probably not gonna leave it there,\n\n73\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.010\nI could put it more towards the top or\ntowards the bottom.\n\n74\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.400\nBut notice I have the shield here, that's\nsaying I have an IPS policy in here.\n\n75\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.421\nI wish it told me which one I had in\nthere, because if we can see this,\n\n76\n00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.190\nif I come in here, it just tells\nme I have an intrusion policy.\n\n77\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.804\nIt would be nice if it said what\nthe actual policy name was, right, but\n\n78\n00:04:04.804 --> 00:04:05.550\nit doesn't.\n\n79\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.735\nSame thing with the File Policy,\nit just says, hey,\n\n80\n00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:12.610\nin this little rule, it's an allow rule\nwhich you have to have to get an IPS and\n\n81\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.690\nfile policy, but\nit just tells me which ones.\n\n82\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.935\nAnd notice here's the scroll which is now\njust showing me that I'm logging this,\n\n83\n00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.650\nright, cuz I chose logging,\nit's very important.\n\n84\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.880\nWe definitely wanna log this.\n\n85\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.159\nNow at the end I have block all traffic,\nso\n\n86\n00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.518\ndefinitely need some allow rules in here.\n\n87\n00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:31.195\nI just created a bunch of deny rules,\nalthough it would be fun for the event.\n\n88\n00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:33.095\n>> It would be an incredibly\nsecure network.\n\n89\n00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.885\n>> I've made these things so\n\n90\n00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:38.880\nincredibly secure that no traffic got\nthrough, it's not that hard to do.\n\n91\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.170\n[LAUGH] I've done that before and\nI'm impressed with myself,\n\n92\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.885\nI'm like that's impressive.\n\n93\n00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.894\nThe customer's not impressed,\nbut I'm definitely impressed.\n\n94\n00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:50.589\nNow let's block,\nlet's go right to the URL filter, so\n\n95\n00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.910\nI'm gonna get in a little\nmore detail here.\n\n96\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.770\nBlock social media.\n\n97\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.010\nSo I have a URL license so\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n98\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.160\nNow there's a couple different blocks,\n\n99\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.110\nI can just do block, again, kind of not\na really good experience for the user.\n\n100\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.210\nBlock with reset,\n\n101\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.370\nbasically, cuz if I have a TCP session\nit's just gonna keep sending data.\n\n102\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.111\nJust cuz I block it it doesn't\nknow that it's blocked or\n\n103\n00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.087\neven care that it's blocked,\nit's just gonna keep sending.\n\n104\n00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:22.333\nSo, what I'm gonna do is send a fen\nflag [LAUGH] down to the TCP session and\n\n105\n00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:25.000\nit's gonna stop from sending.\n\n106\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.120\nAll right, [LAUGH] so\nI could do a block with reset.\n\n107\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.020\nNow in this case here,\nthey're gonna get our ACP responses.\n\n108\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.000\nAnd it's gonna just say, hey,\n\n109\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.340\nyou were blocked because you're trying to\ngo somewhere that we don't want you to go.\n\n110\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.070\nOr we can make it an interactive block,\nwhich would allow them to go through and\n\n111\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.430\nclick and say OK.\n\n112\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.460\nNow that being said,\nI'm gonna leave that there, and\n\n113\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.060\nthen I'm gonna come over here,\nand I can choose Networks.\n\n114\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.420\nAnd if I had some here, notice I have\nmy internal networks and my objects.\n\n115\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.200\nNow I also can choose geolocation,\nI'm gonna come back to this one here.\n\n116\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.250\nAnd this is again,\nwhy I didn't create any objects for\n\n117\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.090\ngeolocation because I'm gonna\ncreate them right here.\n\n118\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.540\nSame thing here, I can create an object\nand say, man, I wanna do finance LAN.\n\n119\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.348\nThey called and yelled at me, and I don't\nwant them going, they're 172.17.0.0.16.\n\n120\n00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:12.390\nI don't want them going to Facebook\ncuz that'll teach them to yell at me.\n\n121\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.213\nWhatever, whatever your excuse is,\nwhatever your reason is,\n\n122\n00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:16.746\nI'm gonna block the finance LAN.\n\n123\n00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:19.766\nSo I'm gonna say,\nthe source is the finance LAN.\n\n124\n00:06:19.766 --> 00:06:21.138\nAnd whatever you wanna do,\n\n125\n00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:24.490\ntypically we'll leave this as any\nwhen I get something like this.\n\n126\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.810\nBut then, I can choose the application.\n\n127\n00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.180\nNow one of the other things\nI can do is click Users,\n\n128\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.000\nnow this is gonna be blank right now,\nbecause when we get to our next section\n\n129\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.250\nI'm gonna configure our fireside,\nand our LDAP, and our AD.\n\n130\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.140\nAnd that's gonna fill this section\nup from the AD server with\n\n131\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.960\nthe preconfigured users.\n\n132\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.010\nThis is kinda cool, so\nyou definitely wanna do that part.\n\n133\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.240\nNow, so I can go into Applications and\nI can do it this way, and\n\n134\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.670\nclick Applications again.\n\n135\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.500\nWe saw this in Objects, right?\n\n136\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.660\nSo I'm like, why did I go to Objects,\nI'll just create this here.\n\n137\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.270\nI'm gonna type in face, and I can actually\nget a little more specific, Facebook.\n\n138\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.760\nAnd I can click, and\nthere's quite a few here.\n\n139\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.720\nAnd I'm looking, Facebook,\nvideo chat, I'm like, what is that?\n\n140\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.350\nI'm gonna click the eye,\nit's gonna tell me what it is, right?\n\n141\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.360\nSo I can click all of that,\nI can say all of Facebook, or\n\n142\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.180\nanything that starts with face.\n\n143\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.870\nSo I can do it this way,\nthis is a way to do it.\n\n144\n00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.740\nSo some people ask me, they go,\nwe didn't buy the URL filter,\n\n145\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.270\ncan I still block social media?\n\n146\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.178\nI'm like, yeah,\nyou just have to do it by hand, right?\n\n147\n00:07:19.178 --> 00:07:21.898\nYou have to go to every single one and\nso I'd type in here Twitter and\n\n148\n00:07:21.898 --> 00:07:23.120\nI'd go to each and every one.\n\n149\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.160\nAnd then I would watch what people\ngo to and then block those,\n\n150\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.158\nso it's just a little bit more\neffort to do it this way.\n\n151\n00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:30.510\nBut you're gonna get the same results or\n\n152\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.060\nmaybe even better results if I go to\nthe URL filter if I have the license.\n\n153\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.710\nWouldn't even let me really do much here,\nit would say you're not licensed for this.\n\n154\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.080\nAnd notice all the different\ncategories that they have over here.\n\n155\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.817\nNow I can click all of these different\ncategories, I think there's 88 or\n\n156\n00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:48.268\nwhatever it is, and we don't really\nknow what's in these, right?\n\n157\n00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:52.218\nSo the only way to find out what's for\nusing these to block,\n\n158\n00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:54.746\nwhat we're blocking is by trying it.\n\n159\n00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:58.821\nOkay, so we can come down here and there's\na lot of really weird stuff in here.\n\n160\n00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.375\nAnd you can't click them all at once.\n\n161\n00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.386\nI think you can only 50 categories in,\nso I use two rules to cook all these and\n\n162\n00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.080\ndo I do that?\n\n163\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.812\nYes.\nI have customers that say,\n\n164\n00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:11.459\nI want all of these that are considered\nnon-work sites by Cisco.\n\n165\n00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:13.793\nAnd they update these\nautomatically which is very cool.\n\n166\n00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.659\nLike if they find some new pornography or\nsomething about drugs or alcohol and\n\n167\n00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:20.940\ntobacco, or new sites or whatever,\nthey update these objects.\n\n168\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.420\nSo we're basically putting this URL\nfilter and then they update that for us.\n\n169\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.120\nSo it's kinda cool.\n\n170\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.730\nAnyways-\n>> And\n\n171\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.320\nyou mentioned manually\nsupporting it without a license.\n\n172\n00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.270\nIt is a lot of effort because new\nsites are popping up all the time.\n\n173\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.100\nEspecially when it comes to like\nBitTorrent and file sharing sites.\n\n174\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.400\nAnd those are the sites that\nare most likely to have a tax.\n\n175\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.140\nAnd so it is nice to have somebody\nelse updating the database.\n\n176\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.940\n>> That's a really good point.\n\n177\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.540\nBut this customer that asked me that, I\nthink it was their URL filter license for\n\n178\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.950\nlike a grand for three years or something.\n\n179\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.510\nAnd they were like,\ntheir boss wasn't gonna do it.\n\n180\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.830\nHe's like, can I do it by hand?\n\n181\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.792\nYeah, you can.\n\n182\n00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:56.584\nJust sit home one night,\nwatching TV, and knock yourself out.\n\n183\n00:08:56.584 --> 00:08:59.440\nSo we could pick some\ndifferent stuff in here.\n\n184\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.750\nBut what are we looking for?\n\n185\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.950\nSocial and\nin here it's called social network.\n\n186\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.100\nI think I have to spell that right.\n\n187\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.080\nAnd so I'm just gonna click this.\n\n188\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.760\nAnd I can choose any reputation.\n\n189\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.960\nOne of things I can do is I can come in\nhere and say if they're suspicious or\n\n190\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.900\nhigh risk sites.\n\n191\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.180\nIf they're well known we're\ngonna let them go, but\n\n192\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.040\nin this case here we're not\ngonna let anybody go, right?\n\n193\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.970\nOkay.\n\n194\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.080\nSo, I'm gonna click Any and\nsay Add to rule.\n\n195\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.590\nAnd then we'll see that\nthat's added over here, and\n\n196\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.820\nhere's my social networks any reputation.\n\n197\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.360\nOkay.\n\n198\n00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.140\nAnd, of course, what are we gonna\ndo if someone does do this and\n\n199\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.630\nthey get blocked because of it?\n\n200\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.810\nNow we did a block with reset and\nwe had set up our responses.\n\n201\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.600\nSo they're going to say,\nhey you're not supposed to go there.\n\n202\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.670\nAnd then we can only log at the beginning,\nright?\n\n203\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.794\nAnd so, I'll go down here and say add.\n\n204\n00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:56.626\nOkay, gotta do this a little smaller.\n\n205\n00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:58.740\nOkay, so now I'm gonna add that in there.\n\n206\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.667\nIt's all great and good.\n\n207\n00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.792\nSo, notice what this says here.\n\n208\n00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:07.167\nNow, what you're gonna see in the newer\ncode is they started doing this.\n\n209\n00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:10.500\nAnd they say this is preempted\nby the rule above it.\n\n210\n00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.129\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that the\nrule above it is going to block Facebook.\n\n211\n00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:18.160\nI don't even think we put that in\nour IPS policy or file policy.\n\n212\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.835\nBut the problem, what this thing\nsays is I'm not sure if you did.\n\n213\n00:10:21.835 --> 00:10:23.590\nI might block it.\n\n214\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.800\nIt might be preempted.\n\n215\n00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.543\nSo sometimes you are going to\nlook at these and go, okay.\n\n216\n00:10:28.543 --> 00:10:30.991\nIt's fine just because you\nhave some of these in there,\n\n217\n00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.550\ndoesn't mean your rules\nnot working correctly.\n\n218\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.543\nWe definitely wanna look at those,\nand then make sure we understand them.\n\n219\n00:10:37.543 --> 00:10:40.337\nBut having just one of those in there,\nthese warnings,\n\n220\n00:10:40.337 --> 00:10:43.300\nthis is show warnings,\nis not the end of the world.\n\n221\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.002\nAll right, that being said, let's go\nover here and create another rule.\n\n222\n00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:50.300\nAnd here's one of the things\nthat I typically do.\n\n223\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.792\nAnd this one was,\nI wanna monitor ALL Connections.\n\n224\n00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:00.877\nOkay, and so I'm gonna come down here.\n\n225\n00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:01.910\nNotice there's a Trust.\n\n226\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.002\nWe're gonna get back to that.\n\n227\n00:11:03.002 --> 00:11:04.050\nAnd there's a Monitor.\n\n228\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.650\nThere's my Interactive Block, and so on.\n\n229\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.538\nLet's go to Monitor.\n\n230\n00:11:06.538 --> 00:11:09.417\nSo I'm gonna click Monitor.\n\n231\n00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.040\nALL Connections.\n\n232\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.667\nAnd I'm not gonna do anything here.\n\n233\n00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:14.980\nThis is just all INI, INI, INI, INI, INI.\n\n234\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.810\nBut I'm gonna log it.\n\n235\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.570\nAnd notice that It's already logged.\n\n236\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.620\nSo all I have to do is choose that, say\nOK, and it's already preconfigured for me.\n\n237\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.284\nAnd basically,\n\n238\n00:11:22.284 --> 00:11:25.376\nthis is just going to monitor any\nconnections whatsoever that come through.\n\n239\n00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:28.490\nI wanna know about it, I wanna see it,\nand it's gonna go into my logs.\n\n240\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.630\nOkay?\nThat's fine.\n\n241\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.190\nBut notice where it's at.\n\n242\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.569\nAll right?\nThis may or may not work, so\n\n243\n00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:34.850\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna grab this guy.\n\n244\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.453\nAnd I'm gonna move him to the very top,\n\n245\n00:11:36.453 --> 00:11:38.561\nbecause I wanna monitor\nall traffic that comes in.\n\n246\n00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:39.730\nAll right?\n\n247\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.545\nThat'll get one triangle to go away.\n\n248\n00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:42.650\nOkay?\n\n249\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.600\nSo chances are if I move this triangle\nup to here, then I get a triangle here.\n\n250\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.650\nYou can't win.\n\n251\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.300\nAgain, it doesn't mean it doesn't work.\n\n252\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.670\nI see this work all the time.\n\n253\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.690\nLet's take a look at one more rule, and\nthen we'll look at a more advanced one.\n\n254\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:02.502\nSo I'm going to say Trust DNS lookups.\n\n255\n00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:05.140\nAll right, so this is one of\nthe things you see a lot of traffic on.\n\n256\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.004\nAnd I have that monitor-all, so\nI'd get a lot of connections for\n\n257\n00:12:09.004 --> 00:12:11.400\npeople that are querying for a DNS name.\n\n258\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.970\nI'm like, I really don't care.\n\n259\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.660\nI don't feel that's a big threat for me.\n\n260\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.170\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to come in here, and\n\n261\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.300\nI'm gonna say trust this traffic.\n\n262\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.251\nSo I'm going to trust DNS lookup.\n\n263\n00:12:19.251 --> 00:12:21.168\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to.\n\n264\n00:12:21.168 --> 00:12:22.210\nYou can go to applications.\n\n265\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.251\nNow there's two different ways to do this,\nlet me explain the difference.\n\n266\n00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:29.712\nSo then go to Applications and pick DNS.\n\n267\n00:12:29.712 --> 00:12:31.339\nLet's see if I can do it here.\n\n268\n00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:37.512\nNot Applications, Networks, yeah.\n\n269\n00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:40.340\nImports is what I want.\n\n270\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.060\nSo DNS over UDP.\n\n271\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.850\nAnd I'm gonna say, if my destination\nis DNS over UDP, right, in my ports.\n\n272\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.040\nThis is probably the best way to do it.\n\n273\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.667\nI believe I could have come here and\ndone it from here as well.\n\n274\n00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:55.750\nThought I could.\n\n275\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.010\nYeah, I can do it from\nhere as an application.\n\n276\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.640\nI don't really want to use\nthis as an application.\n\n277\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.280\nWe're going up a another layer in\nlooking for DNS and in this case here.\n\n278\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.759\nSo this is my whole point I wanted to do\nis I wanna do ports only going to layer\n\n279\n00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:09.126\nfour instead of going to\nlayer seven in this case.\n\n280\n00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:10.420\nNow, hold on.\n\n281\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.001\nDid I actually need to use this?\n\n282\n00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:14.292\nNo, this is a pre-authored object.\n\n283\n00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:16.268\nAnd had I gone to ports\nin that object screen,\n\n284\n00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:18.330\nyou would have seen all\nthese pre-authored.\n\n285\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.042\nI could have easily come in here and\nsaid protocol UDP.\n\n286\n00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:27.050\nAnd the port is 53.\n\n287\n00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:28.680\nAnd add it.\n\n288\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.960\nI just added it in there too.\n\n289\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.330\nWell, I actually put that, I hit add,\nI couldn't see the whole screen.\n\n290\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.167\nBut nonetheless, there was a couple\ndifferent ways I could do this.\n\n291\n00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.690\nNow where am I going to put this?\n\n292\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.740\nAnd I'm gonna trust DNS Lookups,\nso we're trusting DNS over UDP.\n\n293\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.050\nCan't see that, can you?\n\n294\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.292\nTrusting DNS over UDP.\n\n295\n00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:51.709\nNow so,\nwe don't want to even monitor that.\n\n296\n00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:54.500\nI didn't even notice I didn't\neven log it because I don't care.\n\n297\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.170\nI'm just gonna trust it, so\nI'm gonna move that to the very top.\n\n298\n00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.930\nOkay, so I'm trusting some traffic.\n\n299\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.090\nAnd this right here just\nsays go right to egress,\n\n300\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.240\ndon't even go through\nthe access control policy.\n\n301\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.501\nRight, this one says log it,\nand go down to the next rule.\n\n302\n00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.991\nThis one here is gonna add my IPS and file\npolicy, and then this one in this case,\n\n303\n00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:14.770\nblocks social media.\n\n304\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.930\nOne more rule, lets say I block Germany.\n\n305\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.140\nAnd I'm gonna say block.\n\n306\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.090\nI typically like to do block with resets,\nbut it depends on what you guys wanna do.\n\n307\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.252\nAnd I'm gonna come under\nhere under networks.\n\n308\n00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:31.280\nAnd I'm gonna hit geolocation.\n\n309\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.130\nAnd then, I'm gonna type in Germany.\n\n310\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.400\nNow, I don't have to worry about IPs.\n\n311\n00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.793\nI'm gonna let them do it.\n\n312\n00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:40.200\nI think it's under DEU for Deutschland.\n\n313\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.181\nAnd I'm gonna say if the source is coming\nfrom Germany, then we're gonna block and\n\n314\n00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:46.333\nI'm gonna log it.\n\n315\n00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.292\nOkay?\n\n316\n00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:51.355\nAnd I do this as particularly\nas my classes because I go out\n\n317\n00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:54.416\nsome places that have malware in Germany.\n\n318\n00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:56.754\nOkay?\n\n319\n00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:58.750\nThis is driving me crazy.\n\n320\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.334\nAll right.\n\n321\n00:14:59.334 --> 00:15:06.080\nSo you notice I have these little things,\nthey're saying, they'll show warnings.\n\n322\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.270\nThese very well may be pre-empted,\nbut doubtful not with our IPS and\n\n323\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.610\nfile policy, right?\n\n324\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.250\nSo we just have to keep this in mind and\nsay okay that's fine.\n\n325\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.600\nSo I'm going to come in here, the one\nthing I haven't done is chose my target.\n\n326\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.439\nAll right.\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n327\n00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:25.459\nchoose my target, choose the policy,\nand then say over here, save and apply.\n\n328\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.460\nAnd I try.\n\n329\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.010\nOkay.\n\n330\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.260\nThere we go.\n\n331\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.292\nAll right.\n\n332\n00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:38.897\nI try to show you guys cuz I'm looking up\nat the screen at what you're seeing and\n\n333\n00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:39.459\nI can't see it.\n\n334\n00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:42.272\nSo I try to make it bigger, but\nit makes it a little difficult,\n\n335\n00:15:42.272 --> 00:15:43.660\na little cumbersome.\n\n336\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.690\nApply to all and let's see,\nwe get that error.\n\n337\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.830\nI did so\nit's telling me about these warnings.\n\n338\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.534\nIs that big deal?\n\n339\n00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.474\nIt's not, based on what we know.\n\n340\n00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:57.179\nNow let's see if this applies.\n\n341\n00:16:03.155 --> 00:16:04.540\nThis does take a minute.\n\n342\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.960\nNow let me ask you a question.\n\n343\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.030\nI think traffic's still going through at\nthis moment, but as this goes further\n\n344\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.070\non and it's actually applying the policy\nand pushing it out there, at this point,\n\n345\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:18.150\nwe have it configured on the advanced\nscreen traffic to come through unexpected.\n\n346\n00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:24.040\nWe can uncheck that, where traffic won't\ngo through at all, while it's doing this.\n\n347\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:30.730\nSo while this is doing this,\nlet's go out to another one.\n\n348\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.130\nAnd let's take a look at an access\ncontrol policy on a much bigger device.\n\n349\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.210\nSo we can see lots of connection\nevents that I am seeing here.\n\n350\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.080\nI need to look through all of these.\n\n351\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:47.350\nBut the one thing I wanna look at here,\nis I wanna go to Policies, Access Control.\n\n352\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.510\nAnd let's take a look at some\nintense access control policies.\n\n353\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.260\nTake a quick gander.\n\n354\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.950\nOkay.\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n355\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.730\ntake a look at this.\n\n356\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.080\nThis is a Cisco authored one,\nit's pretty intense.\n\n357\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.580\nAll right.\n\n358\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.330\nLet me see if that's\nstill going over there.\n\n359\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.170\nOkay.\n\n360\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.060\nNow in this case here notice that\nhere's our administrator rule.\n\n361\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.570\nStandard rules,\nthey created another category.\n\n362\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.020\nSo there is a category\ncalled trusted traffic.\n\n363\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.910\nAnd so it doesn't matter what it's\ncalled this where they put it.\n\n364\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.850\nSo again having administrator rules\ndoesn't mean anything more important than\n\n365\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.080\njust works out in your\naccess control policy.\n\n366\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.620\nIn this case here we can look\nat some this trusted traffic and\n\n367\n00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.730\nsee that we are trusting it,\nwe're not logging it.\n\n368\n00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.370\nRight, typically when you trust traffic,\nyou're not logging it like I did.\n\n369\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.960\nAnd I wanna see those updates.\n\n370\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.980\nIn this case here, they like Adobe AIR.\n\n371\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.090\nThey're just saying if it's Adobe AIR\ntrust it, for whatever reason.\n\n372\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.600\nAnd then they have some web\nports here that they're trusting\n\n373\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.740\ncoming from some certain IP addresses\ngoing to some certain IP addresses.\n\n374\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.200\nThey're trusting it, so probably\nan intranet of some sort, saying trust it,\n\n375\n00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.510\nwe don't want it logged.\n\n376\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.660\nYou can see there's a lot\nof trust going on here.\n\n377\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.390\nOkay, let's go down a little bit further\nand now we're seeing our IPS and\n\n378\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.990\nfile policies.\n\n379\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.903\nLet's go back up a hair, it's kind\nof hard to get through this thing.\n\n380\n00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:13.012\nOkay.\n\n381\n00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:16.389\n[LAUGH] Little by little here.\n\n382\n00:18:20.764 --> 00:18:24.594\n>> The AJAX interface they've gone to here\nwhich allows you to drag and drop rules\n\n383\n00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:28.538\ninside of the UI is nice, it makes it easy\nto work with, but it makes it hard to just\n\n384\n00:18:28.538 --> 00:18:30.722\nscroll up and scroll down because-\n>> Yeah it does-\n\n385\n00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:31.595\n>> it's dynamically generating\n\n386\n00:18:31.595 --> 00:18:32.100\nthat interface.\n\n387\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.740\nThat's why you guys can see\nthose refresh lines going down,\n\n388\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.490\nit's actually in the browser,\nit's from that interface.\n\n389\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.030\nPros and cons for functionality.\n\n390\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.600\n>> Pros and cons.\n\n391\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.575\nYeah.\nSo in other words here we have some\n\n392\n00:18:41.575 --> 00:18:45.240\nallow rules because their allow\nrules have an IPS and file policy.\n\n393\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.230\nNotice they have multiple of them.\n\n394\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.750\nRight I can go up a little bit and\n\n395\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.460\nthese are like if the source is http then\nwe have notice to pick a particular port.\n\n396\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.950\nProtocol or port here.\n\n397\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.400\nAnd they're saying if it's a, we have our\nIPS policy in there logging these, right.\n\n398\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.050\nOkay, now we have regional controls,\ncheck this thing out.\n\n399\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.130\nWe were actually if our\nsource network is this, and\n\n400\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.370\nour destination network is, I don't\nknow what they're calling these right.\n\n401\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.480\nSo we have the bad net countries,\ngood countries type of thing.\n\n402\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.220\nWe're blocking it and logging it.\n\n403\n00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.860\nRight, we're just doing a block,\nall right, a plain old block.\n\n404\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.870\nOkay, so we can go down here and\nsee here's some interactive blocks for\n\n405\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.700\npeople that are.\n\n406\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.660\nAnd All IPs is an object that's if you\nlook inside their object on here you'll\n\n407\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.540\nsee that the All IPs is their all of their\ninternal networks for the entire network.\n\n408\n00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.870\nAnd they're actually blocking,\n\n409\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.150\ncheck this out,\nsee these different reputation controls.\n\n410\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.950\nThey're using all of those categories.\n\n411\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.860\nIt take multiple different rules.\n\n412\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.780\nThere are all those categories\nwith IPS and file policy.\n\n413\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.200\nAnyone that goes through\nthis access point,\n\n414\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.740\ncontrol policy isn't doing anything but\nwork.\n\n415\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.870\nAlright, there's no going to CNN or\nwhatever news site you like to go to.\n\n416\n00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.150\nThere's none of that's happening right.\n\n417\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.430\nSo, we can see they pretty much set the\nsecurity intelligence the same way I did.\n\n418\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.420\nAnd they're issuing responses\nthe same way I did.\n\n419\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.200\nAnd so, very, very cool.\n\n420\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.780\nSo we can see that this is\nstill applying here, and\n\n421\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.680\nnow it's going into the task status.\n\n422\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.130\nI didn't get that error that I guys,\ntold you about on that advance screen.\n\n423\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.320\nYou know it's kinda hit and miss.\n\n424\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.660\nI mostly get that error,\n\n425\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.440\nwhere that IPS policy is applied\nwhen we're determining that rule.\n\n426\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.140\nSo typically when I do\nthat I'll get an error.\n\n427\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.100\nIn this case I didn't so I wont show\nyou how to fix it cuz it's working.\n\n428\n00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.180\nSo in that case here,\nwe can see that we're completed and\n\n429\n00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.360\nwe're running our access control policy.\n\n430\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.730\nSo there's my system policy, my ACP.\n\n431\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.370\nIt seems so if I've remove completed jobs,\nit looks like it went.\n\n432\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.330\nOkay.\n\n433\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330\nSo wer'e looking good without access\ncontrol policy, now we have our\n\n434\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:49.120\nfile policy, IPS policy, our access\ncontrol policy, and we're logging.\n\n435\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.370\nI know I don't have a lot\naccess control policy, but\n\n436\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.210\nit's absolutely enough to get\nyou through it and get started.\n\n437\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.970\nAnd you can choose the different\ncategories with URL filtering.\n\n438\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.140\nYou can choose different applications.\n\n439\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.400\nYou can use the sales.\n\n440\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.730\nIn our next episode we're gonna go out and\ndo FireSite.\n\n441\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.380\nAnd we're gonna do the LDAP and AD.\n\n442\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.660\nAnd that's gonna show us, you know, put\nthose stuff in our access control policies\n\n443\n00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.470\nwhere you have users and sales and so on.\n\n444\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.990\nOkay.\n\n445\n00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.140\nSo we're looking good.\n\n446\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:13.780\n>> Excellent.\nAll right,\n\n447\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.280\nwell, we just got a chance to see\nall those rules which are really\n\n448\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.880\nthe critical piece to get our\naccess control policy up and going.\n\n449\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.390\nAt this point, we've got FirePOWER\ndeployed and pretty well running.\n\n450\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.770\nAgain, a lot of customization is\ngonna happen for any company and\n\n451\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.940\nwe've seen a lot of that.\n\n452\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.910\nWe still have a little bit\nmore to get through, though,\n\n453\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.050\nwhich is what we're gonna be\nbringing up in our next episode.\n\n454\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.180\nSo I hope you guys have\nenjoyed watching it so far.\n\n455\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.720\nEnough for now.\n\n456\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.170\nI'm signing off for ITProTV.\n\n457\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.260\nI'm Don Pizet.\n\n458\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.223\n>> Todd Lanly.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:21:41.223 --> 00:21:47.590\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.303\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:21.948\nI'm your host, Don Pezet back with another\nepisode of Cisco ASA Express Security, and\n\n5\n00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:25.148\nin this episode, we're gonna be\nrounding off the last of our\n\n6\n00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:29.130\npolicies with something that's not\neven necessary really a policy.\n\n7\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.200\nWe've talked about our\naccess control policies,\n\n8\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.850\nyou saw our other policies like\nthe IPS policies and file policies.\n\n9\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.020\nWe've got all of those wrapped\ntogether and in place on a firewall.\n\n10\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.070\nThe next thing to deal with, well,\njust a couple little odds and\n\n11\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.790\nends here at the end.\n\n12\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.400\nPretty important ones,\ndiscovery and scheduling, and\n\n13\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.940\nthose are the two things we're gonna\ntake a look at here in this episode to\n\n14\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.330\nround off our FirePOWER deployment.\n\n15\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.560\nAnd back in the studios again\nto help us out with this one,\n\n16\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.520\nwe've got Tom Lammle here, and Tom,\nlet's take a look at a little discovery.\n\n17\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.290\n>> Absolutely.\nSo we talked about FireSIGHT,\n\n18\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.890\nit's a passive technologies that finds\nour applications, hosts and users, and\n\n19\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.580\nwe can use that to our advantage for\nhelping us diagnose our network and\n\n20\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.050\ntrace down problems.\n\n21\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.580\nFor example, when malware's in my network,\nhow do I know who has it?\n\n22\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.210\nAn IP address doesn't really\nhelp me all that much.\n\n23\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.200\nSo this is going to really help us.\n\n24\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.020\nSo let's take a look, the first thing,\nI've got another policy here now.\n\n25\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.230\nNow that we have our access control policy\ndone I can come back to network discovery.\n\n26\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.680\nBefore we were getting that wrong Snort\nversion error because my access control\n\n27\n00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.758\npolicy wasn't applied.\n\n28\n00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:28.340\nSo I'm gonna click Network Discovery.\n\n29\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.442\nNow remember, this is running by default,\nit's going out there, running it,\n\n30\n00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.090\nwe're getting FireSIGHT data.\n\n31\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.058\nAnd once we get this done we\ncan go back to our IPS policy,\n\n32\n00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:39.955\nupdate the FireSIGHT recommendations\nafter it runs for a while,\n\n33\n00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:43.470\nbecause you gotta really get some\ngood quality FireSIGHT data.\n\n34\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.570\nGo back to your IPS policy, do FireSIGHT\nrecommendations, turn that on,\n\n35\n00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.680\nlet that run and then schedule it,\nand we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n36\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.340\nSo in this case here one of\nthe things that you're gonna do,\n\n37\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.210\nthis is why I create one of those,\n\n38\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.540\nthat one object Is notice that it's\ndoing all networks, four and six.\n\n39\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.770\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\n\n40\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.360\nthe first thing I'm gonna do is I pretty\nmuch probably want to delete this out.\n\n41\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.190\nBecause if not, anytime anyone goes to the\nInternet, that host that they attach to,\n\n42\n00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.270\nwe're gonna get information on,\n\n43\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.270\nand we're gonna keep that\ninformation in our database.\n\n44\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.570\nSo I'm gonna get rid of that,\nand say no, no, no.\n\n45\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.130\nWe're gonna go ahead and look at this, so\n\n46\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.360\nhere's my object, my RFC 1918,\nI'm gonna add that.\n\n47\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.450\nNow I'm only looking at my internal\nnetworks, or something that's RFC net.\n\n48\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440\nSo now we're not getting\ninformation on the outside hosts.\n\n49\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.960\nSo that's the first thing you're gonna do.\n\n50\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.180\nNow, the other thing was, is,\n\n51\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.680\nI'm sorry, I missed something\nwhen I went in there, I forgot.\n\n52\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.930\nYou wanna do use host and\nwe wanna get user information.\n\n53\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.150\nSo I didn't hit that one.\n\n54\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.270\nSo don't forget to hit, that's not on by\ndefault, host users and applications.\n\n55\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.130\nNow there's a couple other tabs over here.\n\n56\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.860\nRight, so let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n57\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700\nSo we've got the User tab, and\nI don't usually play with this one, but\n\n58\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.050\nthese are some protocols that go out\nthere that have user names in clear text\n\n59\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.000\nthat they gather.\n\n60\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.030\nSo you can turn those on and off,\nand I usually leave those alone.\n\n61\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.910\nBut on the Advanced tab,\nyou're gonna make a couple decisions here.\n\n62\n00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.500\nAll right, so let's take a look.\n\n63\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.080\nFirst off, I typically capture banners.\n\n64\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.680\nThis is completely up to you,\nbut this is vendor information.\n\n65\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.990\nSo I like to get that myself, so I'm gonna\nsay yes, and then I'm gonna lower this.\n\n66\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.180\n3,600 seconds might be a long time for\nme to gather information FireSIGHT, so\n\n67\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.570\nI typically make this 60 seconds for,\nnot in production.\n\n68\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.820\nSo, you're gonna get this,\nget the FireSIGHT information.\n\n69\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.470\nMaybe raise this back up so, you're not\ngetting too much FireSIGHT data, but\n\n70\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.320\nwe wanna get it right away.\n\n71\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.980\nOkay, so I want to say 60 seconds here.\n\n72\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.180\nThe other thing is when you've\ngot this identity conflict,\n\n73\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.140\nand what this does is,\nFireSIGHT is a passive technology.\n\n74\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.050\nWell I can come down here,\nif we look at this and\n\n75\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.060\nsay there's nmap, which is an active\ntechnology that goes out to hosts and\n\n76\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.560\ndetermines their vulnerabilities.\n\n77\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.750\nSo we can run this and schedule this\nto run and get information, and\n\n78\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.960\nput it in FireSIGHT.\n\n79\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.780\nVery super cool.\n\n80\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.180\nSo same thing with NetFlow.\n\n81\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.330\nWe can use NetFlow information and\nput that in our FireSIGHT data.\n\n82\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.280\nNow if that happens I'm gonna\npossibly get some conflicts.\n\n83\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.340\nRight, do I keep the passive information\nor do I keep the active information?\n\n84\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.750\nIn this case here I'm gonna say,\nI'm gonna generate identity conflicts.\n\n85\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.180\nI'm not gonna have them both in there, and\n\n86\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.940\nI'm gonna use,\nI can keep the passive array active.\n\n87\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.080\nYou guys choose this one.\n\n88\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.570\nI'm gonna say active in this case here.\n\n89\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.840\nSo now also how long do I\nkeep a host in the database?\n\n90\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.430\nIt's seven days by default.\n\n91\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.020\nMaybe you don't wanna keep it\nin there seven days because\n\n92\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.510\nmaybe our FireSIGHT's getting full.\n\n93\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.730\nWe wanna clear it out everyday cuz\nwe get users coming and going, so\n\n94\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.570\nit's completely up to you.\n\n95\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.580\nI usually leave that alone, but the\nbiggest thing is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n96\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.460\nsave this.\n\n97\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.400\nThe biggest thing is,\nnow I'm gonna apply this, and\n\n98\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.781\nthis is gonna push it out to\n[INAUDIBLE] managed device.\n\n99\n00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:47.841\nDoesn't have to go through my actual\npolicy, it takes just a second, and\n\n100\n00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:48.751\nwe'll see that.\n\n101\n00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.670\nOkay, so it's gonna push that out.\n\n102\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.870\nSo, one of the things is,\nis you might wanna come in here, and\n\n103\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.350\nwe'll look at the Task Management and\nget this in here.\n\n104\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.790\nWhat's the most important thing?\n\n105\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.430\nYou don't have to change any of this.\n\n106\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.060\nThe most important thing, really,\n\n107\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.790\ndon't leave the default networks of all\nnetworks, all zeroes, all IPv6 addresses,\n\n108\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.400\nbecause it'll fill up your FireSIGHT\ndatabase relatively quickly.\n\n109\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.360\nSo now that we have that done,\n\n110\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.750\nour FireSIGHT's configured,\nit's out on our managed device.\n\n111\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.670\nI'm gonna let it run for a while,\nlet a bunch of hosts come through, and\n\n112\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.860\nwhat's the first thing I'm gonna do?\n\n113\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.440\nI'm gonna go to my IPS policy and\nadd the FireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n114\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.230\nSo let's go ahead and\npretend that this ran for a while.\n\n115\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.860\nI'm gonna go back to my IPS policy, and\n\n116\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.300\nwe'll pretend like maybe that we gave it a\nweek, that's, [LAUGH] something like that.\n\n117\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.630\nSo it's been a week, how you've been?\n\n118\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.400\nHaven't seen you in a week, right?\n\n119\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.490\nSo we got this quality FireSIGHT data.\n\n120\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.080\nWe're in Fantasy Land,\nthat's our business name, Fantasy Land.\n\n121\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.230\nSo we're doing this,\nwe're getting the data and\n\n122\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.340\nnow there's a reason that I'm doing this,\nall right, and\n\n123\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.740\nit's gonna take a second to bring this up\nand it's gonna take a second to apply it.\n\n124\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.840\nBut once that's done there's a reason\nthat I'm doing this even without any data\n\n125\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840\nso you can see it.\n\n126\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.710\nSo we have our stuff here, and\nlet's say that we've tuned it.\n\n127\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.630\nNow we're gonna do drop all online, right?\n\n128\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.520\nWe've tuned it to our analysis, and we've\ntuned our IPS policy, I come back in here.\n\n129\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.300\nBut I'm also gonna say, go ahead and\nrun the FireSIGHT recommendations.\n\n130\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.760\nI know you've been out there looking,\nI know there's a lot of stuff, so\n\n131\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.086\nI'm gonna say, generate.\n\n132\n00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:14.140\nLet me look at the advanced\nsettings first, and\n\n133\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.350\nremember one of the things that I told\nyou is, the overhead on the rules,\n\n134\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.970\nthey all have an overhead setting\non them that Snort knows about.\n\n135\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.450\nHow long does this Snort rule\ntake to look at a file, right?\n\n136\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.520\nSo what I can say is,\nthe rules, I don't want it,\n\n137\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.300\nI want the threshold to be kinda low.\n\n138\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.670\nIn other words I don't want any rules\nthat take a lot of time, right?\n\n139\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.970\nSo I'm gonna leave it at medium, but\nif you wanna say, I don't want that or\n\n140\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.420\nI want it really high, then you're gonna\nhave a lot of rules that are gonna take\n\n141\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.710\na little bit more time to process\na file that's coming through.\n\n142\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.830\nSo that's completely up to you.\n\n143\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.580\nThis is where you set it, though.\n\n144\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.590\nJust gonna leave it at medium and\nmaybe just leave it alone.\n\n145\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.350\nSo I'm gonna say, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndisable rules that I think should be\n\n146\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.778\ndisabled, and then I'm gonna go ahead and\ngenerate and use recommendations.\n\n147\n00:07:00.778 --> 00:07:03.920\nSo this kinda takes a minute, and\nagain, we're gonna pretend that\n\n148\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.650\nwe've been running our data for a while,\nthere's been a lot of users out there.\n\n149\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.280\nIt's been at least three or\n\n150\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.600\nfour days longer depending on how\nmuch data's been going through.\n\n151\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.156\nAgain, without the quality FireSIGHT data,\n\n152\n00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:18.545\nit's not gonna really do anything on our\nnetwork in this case here, but again,\n\n153\n00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:21.710\nthere's a method to my madness,\nin this case here.\n\n154\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.770\nSo notice how we see this here, and\nthen we have our little triangle up here.\n\n155\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.940\nIt's going to set recommendations.\n\n156\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.450\nNow one of the things, it's going to do,\nis we'll see when we go to our layers.\n\n157\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.346\nWe're gonna get a new layer now.\n\n158\n00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:36.240\nRight, it's gonna be right above\nthe base layer, before our shared layer,\n\n159\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.800\nbefore our changes layer.\n\n160\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.340\nRight, so it's really kind of considered\na built-in layer as we'll see, and\n\n161\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.600\none of the things is, don't you think\nthat as this runs maybe every week, or\n\n162\n00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.280\ndepending on how many hosts you have and\nso\n\n163\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.210\non, that you want this\nupdated on a continual basis?\n\n164\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.640\nSo wouldn't you have to come out\nhere every week, every Friday night,\n\n165\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.650\nwhatever it is, choose this, update the\nrecommendations, reapply your IPS policy,\n\n166\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.780\nand then you'd have to reapply\nyour access control policy.\n\n167\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.280\nSo this is actually taking a second so\nwe're gonna, it's almost gonna be done.\n\n168\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.893\nWatched pot never-\n>> While we're waiting on\n\n169\n00:08:10.893 --> 00:08:11.500\nthat, let me ask.\n\n170\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.910\nSo when we're doing discovery and\nit's watching that traffic and looking for\n\n171\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.690\nthings, who's actually\ncollecting that data?\n\n172\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.020\nIs it the FirePOWER enabled box, or\nis the FireSIGHT management center?\n\n173\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.010\nWho's actually actively\ngrabbing that data?\n\n174\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.050\n>> It's actually coming from the managed\ndevices to the defense center, right?\n\n175\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.370\n>> Okay.\n>> So everything is\n\n176\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.770\ncorrelated back to the defense center.\n\n177\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.260\nSo in this case, our database,\nthat's where it's gonna be.\n\n178\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.430\n>> So, even though we're doing\ndiscovery on multiple devices,\n\n179\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.930\nit is all getting centrally dumped.\n\n180\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.360\nSo we just have one place to go,\nthere's all of our data.\n\n181\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.740\n>> Yes, and again, I mentioned this,\nwhy is this product so great?\n\n182\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.628\nBecause we have place to correlate events,\nwhether it's FireSIGHT,\n\n183\n00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:47.040\nIPS Events, Intrusion Events, and so on.\n\n184\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.510\nAll right, let's take a look here.\n\n185\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.870\nPolicy's now using\nthe generated recommendations.\n\n186\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.900\nThat's fine.\n\n187\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.940\nSo notice I'm gonna look under my\npolicy layers and there's FireSIGHT.\n\n188\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.850\nSo when I look at my layers,\nI'm gonna see the four layers that I have.\n\n189\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.840\nThese are considered the built in layers.\n\n190\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.250\nThen I have where I'd make changes and\nthen I have my policy layers.\n\n191\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.290\nSo that's all great and good.\n\n192\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.460\nLet's go ahead and commit changes and\nwe're gonna apply this.\n\n193\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.720\nNow remember on the subscription of\nchanges, guys, in your system policies I\n\n194\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.280\nshowed you yesterday, if you have a bunch\nof admins that are out doing this,\n\n195\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.630\nyou can force them they can't save this.\n\n196\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.150\nNothing would take effect\nuntil they hit that.\n\n197\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.650\nRight, until they put something in there.\n\n198\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.770\nSo we're gonna let that run for a second.\n\n199\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.280\nIt's gonna reapply our IPS policy,\n\n200\n00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.190\nbut not do anything until we reapply\nour access control policy still.\n\n201\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.090\nSo we're gonna take a look at one\nmore thing in this section, and\n\n202\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.840\nas soon as this gets a little bit further\nin there I'm gonna be able to do it.\n\n203\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.530\nSo there was a reason that I went out and\ndid this without it, and that is because\n\n204\n00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.970\nonce I run these recommended rules,\nnow I can run it as a task.\n\n205\n00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.660\nIt's gonna show up as a possible\nscheduled task, right?\n\n206\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.930\nSo, for example, once you run a particular\nreport, you created a template and run it.\n\n207\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.640\nNow it's in the task and\nyou can use it in your task scheduling.\n\n208\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.350\nSo that's really what I\nwas trying to do here,\n\n209\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.860\nwas showing you,\nlet's update our IPS policies.\n\n210\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.220\nLet's drop it well in line, right.\n\n211\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.180\nLet's update our IPS\npolicies every Friday night,\n\n212\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.820\nget the latest Snort rules downloaded,\ndo the updates, then recommit and\n\n213\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.160\npush our IPS policy and resubmit it, and\nthen push our access control policy out.\n\n214\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.220\nOkay, so this is about done.\n\n215\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.150\nOnce this is done, obviously,\nI can't play with my screen here.\n\n216\n00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.670\nSo now it's saying my IPS\npolicy's out of date.\n\n217\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.410\nYou're right.\n\n218\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.800\nI need to go to my access control\npolicy and push that out, but wait,\n\n219\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.110\nbefore I do that,\nlet's go look at one more thing.\n\n220\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.930\nSystem Tools > Scheduling, right?\n\n221\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.750\nI'm telling you,\nI use this with my customers constantly.\n\n222\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.890\nWhen I look at this schedule,\n\n223\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.040\nit's just full of stuff,\nright when I leave a customer.\n\n224\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.650\nCuz I automate as much stuff as possible,\nget it all done.\n\n225\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.970\nBackups, updates, reports,\nFireSIGHT, updating my IPS policy,\n\n226\n00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.300\nmy access control policy,\npulling down the rules.\n\n227\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.680\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nsay Add Task.\n\n228\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.770\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nsome possible different tasks.\n\n229\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.770\nFirst off, you can do a backup.\n\n230\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.190\nNot gonna go into this as\nbacking up your defense center,\n\n231\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.880\nnot that important to do all the time,\nmaybe once a month or something like that.\n\n232\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.430\nThere is a caveat I wanna tell you about.\n\n233\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.690\nNow, you've got a Snort rule version and\nyou've got a code version.\n\n234\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.080\nSo if you back, if this crashes and\n\n235\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.990\nyou have to restore your backup you have\nto ensure you reinstall the same FireSIGHT\n\n236\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.440\nmanagement center with the same\nSnort version, or it won't work.\n\n237\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.790\nSo what I do is on my backups, I rename\nthem to the actual version of code that\n\n238\n00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.560\nI'm using, and I put this VDB version in,\nthe Snort version in the name.\n\n239\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.010\nThat way I know how to restore it.\n\n240\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.640\nCuz if not, I've gone through this, I've\nobviously had some pain in this before, so\n\n241\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.240\nI mention this.\n\n242\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.440\nAll right,\nnow notice I can schedule an Nmap scan.\n\n243\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.330\nLet me get in here.\n\n244\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.020\nWhat can we schedule?\n\n245\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.790\nI can go out and do an Nmap scan.\n\n246\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:47.000\nDo an active technology on all my hosts\nand put that on my FireSIGHT data.\n\n247\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.380\nI can do a Report,\nI can schedule different reports.\n\n248\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.750\nHave them generated and\nemail me when when they're done so\n\n249\n00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.030\nI can get them,\nsay I have something every Monday morning.\n\n250\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.740\nI can have this done Monday morning\nbefore I get into the office.\n\n251\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.900\nI can just print it out, and then take\nit in, it's nice and colorful beautiful\n\n252\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.980\nreports, and we had a whole section on\nreports in our other FirePOWER class.\n\n253\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.890\nFireSIGHT Recommended Rules,\ncheck this out.\n\n254\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.500\nSo, I'm gonna go in here,\nI'm wanna make this recurring, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.470\nSo now it's gonna say, why do I have\nto go out to FireSIGHT every week and\n\n256\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.100\ndo this, I could just have this do it.\n\n257\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.850\nNow, so I can't start it today,\nso I'll just push this today.\n\n258\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.370\nIf I had just left the date\nalone it wouldn't have worked.\n\n259\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.630\nSo I'm gonna start it tomorrow,\nand I'm gonna repeat every week.\n\n260\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.420\nYou can do it every day if you want,\nwhatever, and\n\n261\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.190\nI'm gonna run it every\nFriday night at 10.30 PM.\n\n262\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.290\nI'm gonna update my\nFireSIGHT recommended rules.\n\n263\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.540\nThis doesn't take very long,\nwe just did it here,\n\n264\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.500\nso you know it's gonna take a few minutes,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.645\nAnd I'm gonna have it done\nevery Friday night at 10.30 PM,\n\n266\n00:12:48.645 --> 00:12:53.700\njob name is FireSIGHT recommended updates,\nweekly, whatever.\n\n267\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.000\nOkay, and who am I gonna apply it to?\n\n268\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.030\nNow remember I can have multiple IPS\npolicies right on this box just for\n\n269\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.318\nmy different managed devices,\nshared layers and so on.\n\n270\n00:13:02.318 --> 00:13:06.882\nSo I'm gonna say all policies in this case\nwe only have the one, and then I can email\n\n271\n00:13:06.882 --> 00:13:10.915\nthe status and this is why we set that\nemail relay up in our system policy,\n\n272\n00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.850\nbecause when this is done, did it work?\n\n273\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.960\nI wanna know.\n\n274\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.980\nRight, now, if it didn't work,\nit's not gonna bring my network down\n\n275\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.070\nbecause I'm only updating\nthe FireSIGHT policy.\n\n276\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.850\nI'm gonna say Save, okay?\n\n277\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.770\nSo, this is gonna put that in there.\n\n278\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:29.090\nNow, I can create lots of different\nscheduled tasks in here and there,\n\n279\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.160\nnow it's starting my weekly updates, so I\nshould see this every week, starting here.\n\n280\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.920\nSo, it's not showing up here but\nif I go to the next month,\n\n281\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.030\nit would show up every week.\n\n282\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.160\nNow once I do a lot of scheduling,\nI can tell you, this thing is pretty full.\n\n283\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.950\nSo we can come back here,\nwe're doing that, but wait.\n\n284\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:48.920\nOnce that's done guys, I wanna come\nhere and let's go back to updates.\n\n285\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.900\nSo I got my FireSIGHT updates,\n\n286\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.260\nnow one of the things I wanna do is update\nmy rule updates and my geolocation.\n\n287\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.580\nSo that's done at 10:30.\n\n288\n00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.410\nSo what I wanna do is now get my\nnew Snort rules as well, okay?\n\n289\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.536\nSo I'm gonna do that first, and\nthen I'm gonna come in here and\n\n290\n00:14:05.536 --> 00:14:09.619\nsay weekly at 11,\nweekly on Fridays at 11 PM,\n\n291\n00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:16.850\n11:30, whatever,\nI'm going to download the rule updates.\n\n292\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.960\nNow I've done my FireSIGHT update, but\n\n293\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.500\nit doesn't do anything to reapply my IPS\npolicy and my access control policy.\n\n294\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.905\nSo I'm gonna do my FireSIGHT, I'm gonna\ndownload the latest rules, then I'm going\n\n295\n00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:33.360\nto reapply my IPS policy and then I'm\ngonna reapply my access control policy.\n\n296\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.690\nSo I just automated a lot of tasks.\n\n297\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.395\nI updated all my Snort rules and\nmy FireSIGHT recommendations every Friday\n\n298\n00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:43.590\nnight at 11:30, and my access control\npolicy is gonna be updated at that time.\n\n299\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.090\nNow whether you choose to transfer data\nat that time and it's a 24 hour shop,\n\n300\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.200\nthen you're gonna stop sending\ndata while this is being updated,\n\n301\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.100\nbut it's gotta be done eventually.\n\n302\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.000\nRight, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n303\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.880\napply that, so that's kind of\na cool little section there.\n\n304\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.470\nI gave you the minimum,\nyou now have a file policy,\n\n305\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.800\na Snort IPS policy,\nthat's updated by default.\n\n306\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.130\nNever have to change it.\n\n307\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.100\nReally, when you're gonna change it,\nthough,\n\n308\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.890\nis when you get a connection of events,\nor IPS events.\n\n309\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.590\nRight click, change them.\n\n310\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.850\nIf it's a false positive,\nclean out the events, but\n\n311\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.140\nyour Snort rules are being\nupdated automatically.\n\n312\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.000\nYour FireSIGHT recommendations are being\nupdated automatically, and it's pushing\n\n313\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.500\nthat up, updating your IPS policy and\nupdating your access control policy.\n\n314\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.430\nSo you now, from what we've done in this\nclass, I know it's an express class.\n\n315\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.890\nQuote, unquote an express class.\n\n316\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.560\nYou really can configure\nan ASA in a minimal fashion,\n\n317\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.720\nconfigure FirePOWER to go ahead and\nmake this work.\n\n318\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.847\nYou can put this in production and\ndo what we did in this class,\n\n319\n00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:43.813\nand it'll actually go out and\nwork and block traffic now.\n\n320\n00:15:43.813 --> 00:15:46.761\n>> Yeah, it seems like a lot of work,\nI mean it can be a lot of work,\n\n321\n00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:50.550\nif you're gonna get in there and customize\nevery single thing to get it to fit your\n\n322\n00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.693\norganization, which you really should do.\n\n323\n00:15:52.693 --> 00:15:56.587\nBut at the end of the day if you just run\nwith the defaults, you can get this up and\n\n324\n00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:59.250\nrunning pretty quickly, and\nthen tweak it as you go.\n\n325\n00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.190\nYou just always wanna be aware\nthat you don't want to end\n\n326\n00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.960\nup with a ton of false positives, a ton\nof legitimate traffic getting blocked.\n\n327\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.000\nAnd so you gotta expect at least\na little bit of customization period.\n\n328\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.660\n>> Yeah, and there is.\n\n329\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.030\nAgain so remember I said, hey a week's\ngone by and now I'm clicking and\n\n330\n00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.400\nthis drop well ain't in line.\n\n331\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.440\nI would never push out an IPS policy and\n\n332\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.185\nthen just say, well let's see if I get\nany calls and I'll tweak from there.\n\n333\n00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:21.570\n>> Good luck.\n[LAUGH] >> I'm not saying you can't do it.\n\n334\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.228\nI'm just saying that's\nprobably not a good idea.\n\n335\n00:16:25.228 --> 00:16:28.367\n>> All right, well, Todd, we got through\nscheduling things, we got that all\n\n336\n00:16:28.367 --> 00:16:31.620\ncreated, we saw discovery, we saw exactly\nwhat's needed to put it in place.\n\n337\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.856\nSo I think it's a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this one up, so\n\n338\n00:16:33.856 --> 00:16:36.050\ndo you have anything else\nthat you wanted to throw in?\n\n339\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.690\n>> No, it was great.\n\n340\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.568\nAnd I understand that this course we\nwere focused on ASA Express security.\n\n341\n00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:42.565\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n342\n00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:45.820\nwe've covered those objectives in spades.\n\n343\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.490\nSo if you're a channel partner or\nwhatever,\n\n344\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.520\nyou just had a phenomenal class, right?\n\n345\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.990\nSo, is there some more in depth stuff?\n\n346\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.330\nYeah, I think you were mentioning about\nanother ASA class, I'm gonna be doing\n\n347\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.660\nsome more CCNA security with ASA, and\nwe also have the FirePOWER class.\n\n348\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.310\nSo, can we take on this and expand on it\nwith some other modules that are included\n\n349\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.740\nin your subscription here, right?\n\n350\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.520\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n351\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.270\nIf you want to do a deep dive into\nactually getting that ASA set up the first\n\n352\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.008\ntime, creating firewall rules,\nNAT and so on.\n\n353\n00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:15.470\nWe have a technical skills show just\non the ASA, we spend quite a bit of\n\n354\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.940\ntime going into it there, and\nthen we've mentioned it more than once,\n\n355\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.210\nthe FirePOWER show that Todd and\nI did a few months back.\n\n356\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.050\nIt's a great show that goes extremely in\ndepth on getting FirePOWER configured and\n\n357\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.360\nup and running and\nall the exciting stuff inside of that.\n\n358\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.580\nSo, really cool stuff,\ndefinitely worth checking out.\n\n359\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.770\nIf you're just looking to pass the 500-260\nexam though, we've hit those objectives-\n\n360\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.550\n>> Yeah, we did.\n\n361\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.480\n>> You're in great shape and you're done.\n\n362\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.180\nBut if you're deploying this in the field,\nI really do encourage you to jump over,\n\n363\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.370\nand check out those other shows\ncuz it is pretty exhaustive and\n\n364\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.330\nyou'll get some good information there.\n\n365\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.120\n>> But, we do have, from here,\n\n366\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.730\nwe can take the ASA,\nwe can take what you learn in FirePOWER.\n\n367\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.570\nYou have the minimum.\n\n368\n00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.350\nIf you don't wanna do that other stuff,\nthis will still work for you.\n\n369\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.010\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthis is a pretty good spot for\n\n370\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.430\nus to wrap this series up.\n\n371\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.670\nI do hope you enjoyed it as much\nas we did in making it, but\n\n372\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.000\nall good things must come to an end.\n\n373\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.830\nSo signing off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n374\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.310\n>> Todd Lammle, see you again soon.\n\n375\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.208\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n376\n00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:11.549\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
