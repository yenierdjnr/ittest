Cisco ASA\nExpress Security course here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120\nNow if you're not familiar with\nASA Express Security, well,\n\n5\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.490\nit's really referring to the firewall\nproduct line that comes from Cisco.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.570\nAnd they don't like to call them firewalls\nanymore, they call them adaptive security\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.096\nappliances because they can do so\nmany different things.\n\n8\n00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.140\nAnd the ASA Express Security course is\na great one because it gives you a high\n\n9\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.810\nlevel view of all the crazy features\nthat are available inside of ASAs and\n\n10\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.320\nsome of the different things\nthat we can do with it.\n\n11\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.730\nIt's a really neat course.\n\n12\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.680\nI know I'm excited about it, not just\nbecause it's a good course, but because\n\n13\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.520\nI've got a very special friend here in\nthe studio to help us go through and\n\n14\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.450\nlearn about all this.\n\n15\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.040\nWe've got Cisco book author and all around\nknowledgable Cisco guy, Todd Lindley,\n\n16\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.090\nhere in the studios with us.\n\n17\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.120\nTodd, thanks for being here.\n\n18\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.560\n>> It's great to be here.\n\n19\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.130\nSo, what made me wanna come back to\nthe studio, cuz we had just done FirePOWER\n\n20\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.290\nbased on when my book came out,\nright, the FirePOWER.\n\n21\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.380\nSo we're gonna cover that.\n\n22\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.320\nBut we already have a course on that and\na full, detailed course.\n\n23\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.770\nBut I got a lot of calls from\nCisco partners and reps.\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.160\nAnd they were saying, hey, we've got\nto get certified on a certain test,\n\n25\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.420\nthe Cisco ASA Express Security 500-260,\nto be able to sell with the FirePOWER.\n\n26\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.470\nSo not a lot of people were\nable to teach FirePOWER today.\n\n27\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.660\nSo getting the pods and the curriculum and\nall of that, so I've got that capability.\n\n28\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.380\nSo I've been doing a lot with that and I\nthought I need to add this as a supplement\n\n29\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.630\nto the course ware and to the book and\nto our existing course.\n\n30\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.970\nLet's, because on that course we did\nthere, Don, it was a very great course.\n\n31\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.020\nExtreme detail of FirePOWER, best video\ncourse in the world, I think, right?\n\n32\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.502\n>> It was very technical too.\n\n33\n00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.330\nIt's like if you hadn't worked with ASAs,\nand\n\n34\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.310\nyou went right into that FirePOWER course,\nyou'd get over your head pretty quickly,\n\n35\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.460\nso it's pretty obvious that we needed\nsome kind of middle ground in between,\n\n36\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.840\nwhat would consider like a-\n>> Stepping stone approach.\n\n37\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.530\nSo we can take a stepping\nstone approach and\n\n38\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.500\nconfigure the ASAs,\nstart at the beginning.\n\n39\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.120\nAnd we're gonna act like you've\nnever seen an ASA before, right,\n\n40\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.940\nwe're gonna talk about naming\nan interface cuz we gotta name it.\n\n41\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420\nWe're gonna create objects, the access\nlist, but one of the things you and\n\n42\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.370\nI were having a conversation about.\n\n43\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.600\nYeah, we're starting at the beginning with\nthe ASA, but we have some pre-requisite\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890\nknowledge base that we think you should\nhave, and I'll let you go into that.\n\n45\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.350\n>> Sure, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.100\nIf you've worked with firewalls a lot,\nthen you may not even need this.\n\n47\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.640\nYou may be able to jump\nright into FirePOWER, but\n\n48\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.220\nif you've never worked with them, you've\ngotta get into that initial configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.393\nAnd that's where we kick things off,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:31.700\nWe're just getting things\nset up like that, but\n\n51\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.851\nwe're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime on fundamentals and theories,\n\n52\n00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.570\nthings like IP subnetting or\nbasic routing principles.\n\n53\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.880\nAnd those are things that they would\nkind of expect you to already have.\n\n54\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.340\nSo a lot of the people that are gonna\nwatch this course are people that have\n\n55\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.300\nalready been through like a CCENT or\n\n56\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.310\na CCNA that at least have that\nbasic knowledge in place.\n\n57\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.930\nTo then be able to take it and\n\n58\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.990\napply it to the firewalls because a lot\nof these concepts aren't new, right?\n\n59\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.080\nAccess control list,\nthat's not a new concept,\n\n60\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.550\nyou've probably seen it in routers.\n\n61\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.680\nNow we're gonna see it in firewalls.\n\n62\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.210\nAnd it's really just\na different set of commands.\n\n63\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.890\n>> Right, so\nwe're gonna see in the new code and\n\n64\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.850\nhow we do access control lists,\nwe're not gonna go into it.\n\n65\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.000\nYou're gonna understand that hey,\nat the end of this access control list,\n\n66\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.700\nthere is a permit IP, or\ndeny IP any any, right?\n\n67\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.410\nSo, we're not gonna mention that,\nwe're gonna assume things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.420\nWe're not gonna go into\nany routing protocols.\n\n69\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.800\nI'll do some static routing on the ASAs\njust for my little network here, but\n\n70\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.710\nalso NAT, I think, and VPNs,\nright, something outside the CCNA.\n\n71\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.040\nSo we're still gonna assume you have\na CCNA level access or knowledge of NAT.\n\n72\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.714\nAnd we're gonna talk about how it's done\non the new code, it's called Object now or\n\n73\n00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:39.800\nObNAT, very cool, very cool stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.300\n>> All right, well, we've talked about\nthe knowledge we expect them to have.\n\n75\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.483\nLet's talk a little about the knowledge\nthat we're gonna give them, right?\n\n76\n00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:45.360\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n77\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.800\nlet's take a look at that outline and\nsee some of the things we're gonna cover.\n\n78\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.435\n>> All right.\n\n79\n00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:52.765\nSo, again, so\nwe got the Express Security 500-260.\n\n80\n00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.285\nAnd we're gonna kind of focus\non those objectives, and\n\n81\n00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:58.565\nwe're going to get into here's an ASA,\nlet's start at the beginning.\n\n82\n00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:01.655\nCuz we're talking about security levels\non the interface, stuff like that.\n\n83\n00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:05.805\nAnd so it's the 500-260 exam,\nis the objectives that we're covering.\n\n84\n00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:11.370\nAnd we're gonna also talk about FirePOWER,\nbut we're not gonna go in as much detail\n\n85\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.650\nas we did in the actual FirePOWER class,\ncuz we don't need to for these objectives.\n\n86\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.330\nHowever, by the end of this course,\nyou'll take an ASA out of the box,\n\n87\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.080\nconfigure it for your network,\ninstall FirePOWER, put policies on, and\n\n88\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.590\nput it into production network.\n\n89\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.680\nThat's our goal by the end of this course.\n\n90\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.350\nSo we have an introduction ASA,\nwhat they are, talk about the products and\n\n91\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.180\nthe licensing and\nhigh availability, and so on.\n\n92\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.340\nInitial configuration is when we get\ninto the IP interfaces, the naming\n\n93\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.090\nand security levels, and\nthen we talk about ACLs,\n\n94\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.470\nand how they're a little bit simpler,\nI think, than an iOS, actually.\n\n95\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.360\nAnd then the nuggets is the same as NAT,\nbut we talk about how we create objects.\n\n96\n00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.130\nWe'll demonstrate creating objects and\nhow those are used within a NAT statement.\n\n97\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.500\nIt's also refered to auto-NAT.\n\n98\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.670\nAll right now, one of the things\nis as we go through this,\n\n99\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.910\nwe're gonna go through quite\na few episodes before.\n\n100\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.222\nYou know on the Command Line and\n\n101\n00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:10.160\nthen we're gonna get into something called\nASDM, which is the GUI that we use today.\n\n102\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.720\nThat's certainly changing this year,\n\n103\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.880\nwe're gonna get a new GUI to configure\nthe ASA and FirePOWER all in one, right?\n\n104\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.320\nSo we're gonna see that\ncoming out shortly.\n\n105\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.000\nBut this is going to cover the ASDM.\n\n106\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.980\nAnd we're gonna see that,\nwe're gonna kinda walk through that.\n\n107\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.500\nI don't use it very much,\n\n108\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.270\nso I'm gonna probably be looking around\na little bit as we're going through there.\n\n109\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.810\nBut the section after that is the VPNs,\nand\n\n110\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.270\nthat's where I do a lot of ASTM because\nit does all this work for you in there.\n\n111\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.510\nAnd VPNs can be extremely detailed.\n\n112\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.816\nSo that's when we use ASDM,\nbut before that,\n\n113\n00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:43.700\npretty much everything\nelse is done from the CLI.\n\n114\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.600\nAfter that, we're gonna get into\nthe FirePOWER and talk about what,\n\n115\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.930\nwhen you get an ASA, how do I make\nthe FirePOWER module come up and\n\n116\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.720\nhow do I create policies and\nwe'll go through the different policies,\n\n117\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.530\nthe file policy, IPS store policy,\nand the access control policy.\n\n118\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.850\nAnd that's kind of our\ngoal with this course,\n\n119\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.644\nto follow along with the exam objectives.\n\n120\n00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:05.180\n>> Yeah, so key thing to remember here\nis that we're gonna spend some good time\n\n121\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.750\ntalking about FirePOWER, it's a very\npowerful, very advanced feature.\n\n122\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.450\nAnd if you're just starting\nout with this show,\n\n123\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.650\nthen you're gonna get a chance\nto see what it can do.\n\n124\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.885\nBut if you really wanna dig into\nthe nitty gritty details and\n\n125\n00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.075\nsee all the things that source fire\ncan do, remember that we've already\n\n126\n00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:22.355\nfilmed a Sourcefire series and\nyou can jump right over and watch that.\n\n127\n00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.195\nIf you've never worked\nwith a firewall before,\n\n128\n00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:26.940\nI don't recommend you jumping\nright into that other course.\n\n129\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.450\nWatch this one first, and\nthen you'll be set up and\n\n130\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.901\nready to jump into the other one and\nbe a success.\n\n131\n00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.494\n>> Right, cuz we're gonna introduce the\nFirePOWER module and we do it there, but\n\n132\n00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:36.710\nI'm still gonna do more of a high\nlevel overview on this one.\n\n133\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.344\nBut we're gonna stop using\nthe word Sourcefire.\n\n134\n00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:39.800\n[LAUGH], all right, so.\n\n135\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.080\n>> You gotta say FirePOWER.\n\n136\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.890\n>> The name, yeah,\nby the time you're watching this,\n\n137\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.510\nwhenever you're watching this, Cisco's\njust renaming this thing FirePOWER, right,\n\n138\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.830\nso it's just FirePOWER.\n\n139\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.250\nAnd so Sourcefire's gone,\nthat was the company they bought.\n\n140\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.258\nSo we'll talk about that in a bit\nwhen we get to that episode.\n\n141\n00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:56.888\n>> All right, so once we've moved\nthrough FirePOWER, we get, I mean,\n\n142\n00:06:56.888 --> 00:06:58.011\nno, I got it right this time.\n\n143\n00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.693\nShoot, I got [CROSSTALK]\n>> You did!\n\n144\n00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:03.420\n>> So once we get through FirePOWER,\nit's been Sourcefire for so long.\n\n145\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.790\nOnce we get through that,\nwe get a high level view of what it does,\n\n146\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.880\nwe move through that,\nwe see it, we're successful.\n\n147\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.690\nWe're ready to basically go back into\nour organization, and at a minimum,\n\n148\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.050\nbe able to take an ASA out of the box,\nturn it on, get it filtering traffic, and\n\n149\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.270\nget FirePOWER enabled and up and running.\n\n150\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.120\n>> Yeah and one of the approaches that I\nwanna take here is obviously, I had so\n\n151\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.440\nmany calls about this exam that\nI wanted to focus on that.\n\n152\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.570\nSo I called this guy and say,\nhey, I'm doing all these classes.\n\n153\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.020\nLet me come down there and film this as\na supplement for those courses, and again,\n\n154\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.918\nyou're gonna use the other\nFirePOWER training for\n\n155\n00:07:33.918 --> 00:07:36.590\nif you're in production\nas a supplement for that.\n\n156\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.870\nIn this case here, we remember that\nthe very beginning, if you've already\n\n157\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.660\nconfigured ASAs for many years, then this\ncourse, the beginning of it isn't for you.\n\n158\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.400\nYou just go over to the FirePOWER course.\n\n159\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.300\nThis is geared toward someone I\nhaven't really seen in ASA course.\n\n160\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.740\nI don't see a lot of ASAs where they start\nat the beginning like we're gonna start.\n\n161\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.190\nAnd then configure it all\nthe way through to FirePOWER and\n\n162\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.500\nputting it into production.\n\n163\n00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.350\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\nstep by step by step by step.\n\n164\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.340\n>> All right well,\nif all that sounds interesting to you,\n\n165\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.520\nI know it sounds interesting to me,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n166\n00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.550\nStay tuned, those episodes are coming up.\n\n167\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.910\nIf it doesn't sound interesting to you,\n\n168\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.770\nif it sounds like it's a little\nover your head, don't worry.\n\n169\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.180\nWe've got the CCENT,\n\n170\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.090\nCCNA training that kinda serves as\nthat foundation available on the site.\n\n171\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.640\nYou can jump right over and\nstart to watch that,\n\n172\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.010\nand then jump back over\nhere when you're ready.\n\n173\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.943\nBut for those of you who are sticking\nwith us, stay tuned because we've got\n\n174\n00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:26.872\nour Cisco ASA Express Security\nshows coming up after this.\n\n175\n00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:34.854\n[SOUND]\n\n",
