  "description": "The Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is one of the most implemented security solutions found in enterprise networks.  Cisco offers an entire series of firewalls that range from small office solutions to very large enterprise solutions. It is because of its commonality that in many businesses an IT Professional would do well to be familiar with the product and some of the most essential configurations.  This series is designed to help an IT Professional to see how to configure many of the features in the ASA through the GUI interface, the ASDM.  This will provide an introduction to the appliance and guidance on some of most used features for any environment.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.192\n[SOUND]\nWe\n\n2\n00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:10.904\nwanna take a moment to introduce to\nyou our new tech skills series on\n\n3\n00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.340\nthe Cisco ASA,\nthe Adaptive Security Appliance.\n\n4\n00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.180\nI wanna take the time to introduce to you\nsome of the different topics we'll be\n\n5\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.750\ncovering in our series to help you,\nas an IT professional, so\n\n6\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.110\nthat you feel ready to work\nwith the Cisco ASA itself.\n\n7\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.000\nThere's many topics that we need to cover.\n\n8\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.270\nSo we wanna get right to it.\n\n9\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.410\nDon, what are some of the different\ntopics we'll be covering?\n\n10\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.550\n>> Now, remember when we talk about a tech\nskills course, we're taking a break from\n\n11\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.280\nthe old certification track where we learn\nwhat the vendors want you to learn and\n\n12\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.970\ninstead looking at the skills that\nwe need in the real world, right?\n\n13\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.120\nAnd so in this tech skills course we're\ngonna be hitting just the stuff that\n\n14\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.280\nyou need to implement and\nget an ASA in production.\n\n15\n00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.462\nIf you're somebody who's tasked with\nthat job but doesn't necessarily want to\n\n16\n00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:51.501\ngo in and achieve the certification,\nor it's a good starting point really,\n\n17\n00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.360\neven if you are gonna work\ntowards that certification.\n\n18\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.113\nSo we're gonna start off really simple,\n\n19\n00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:58.574\nwhat are the different ASA's\nthat are out there, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:01.726\nThere's a good, I don't know, eight\ndifferent models out there right now,\n\n21\n00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.541\nand when you go to buy one, it's kind\nof confusing which ones to pick so\n\n22\n00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:07.691\nwe'll just kind of start off high level\nthere, how do you pick the right ASA for\n\n23\n00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.550\nyour environment?\n\n24\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.360\nAnd then we'll start to take\na look at we get it installed.\n\n25\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.681\nThat basic configuration that we need to\nimplement to get where we can log into\n\n26\n00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.887\nthe thing to even be able to configure\nit and do anything advanced, right?\n\n27\n00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:21.380\nSo starting out really basic.\n\n28\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.360\nIf you have zero experience with the ASA\nthat's exactly where we're gonna start.\n\n29\n00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.860\nSo you'll be just fine.\n\n30\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.380\n>> We also wanna take a look at\nimplementing some firewall rules.\n\n31\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.340\nYou may be familiar with firewall\nrules from working with routers,\n\n32\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.130\nyou may not, but we wanna make that you\nactually understand that we're gonna\n\n33\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.425\nconfigure firewall rules on\nthe outside and inside interfaces.\n\n34\n00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:42.315\nThat'll help us to be able to control\nthe types of traffic they want leaving or\n\n35\n00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:44.665\nalso coming into our network too.\n\n36\n00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.645\n>> Another topic we're gonna touch\non is network address translation.\n\n37\n00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:52.420\nAlmost everybody uses NAT to\nconvert private IPs to public IPs.\n\n38\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.040\nWell let me tell you NAT inside of\na Cisco ASA is a magical beast.\n\n39\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.250\nAnd so we're gonna track down\nthe unicorn and figure out how it works.\n\n40\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.300\nIt's unnecessarily complex.\n\n41\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.250\nBut we'll get a chance\nto see how NAT works and\n\n42\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.120\nyou can kind of unravel the mystery there.\n\n43\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.767\n>> We also want to take a look just\nbriefly at implementing VPNs with\n\n44\n00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.060\nthe Cisco ASA itself.\n\n45\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.610\nRemember that there's normally two types\nof VPNs that we want to be familiar with.\n\n46\n00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.500\nSite to site VPNs,\nas well as remote access VPNs.\n\n47\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.550\nAnd on Cisco ASA, it's not tricky, but it\ndoes take a little bit of time to set up,\n\n48\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.870\nand we're going to show\nyou how to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.700\n>> And then with those topics, we'll have\ncovered the majority of what most people\n\n50\n00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.070\nneed to use to implement an ASA.\n\n51\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.110\nBut then towards the end of the series\nwe're gonna hit a little grab bag of\n\n52\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.530\ntopics, we'll hit our general services\nsection, where we'll take a look at DHCP,\n\n53\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.570\nintrusion detection, web filtering,\na couple of other like odds and\n\n54\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.655\nends that Cisco through into the ASA and\nsay hey, we can make it do this also.\n\n55\n00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:47.470\nWe'll get a chance to see some\nof the power that's there.\n\n56\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.350\n>> We also want to take\na look at monitoring and\n\n57\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.880\njust maintaining the Cisco ASA itself.\n\n58\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.130\nWe'll be taking a look at some of the\ndifferent screens that you have access to.\n\n59\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.170\nMaking sure you feel confident and\nfamiliar with navigating around\n\n60\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.090\nthe Cisco ASA and showing you some of\nthe different ways that we can verify that\n\n61\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.835\nall the tools that are actually there\nare working the way that we want to.\n\n62\n00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:08.415\nNow Don, is there anything else that\nwe may actually choose to cover?\n\n63\n00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:09.335\nWell, let's go in there, right?\n\n64\n00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.155\n>> Yeah.\nThose are the topics we plan to cover,\n\n65\n00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.275\nbut as with any of our shows, if you\nguys wanna see anything extra in there,\n\n66\n00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:14.865\njust let us know.\n\n67\n00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:16.285\nWe can always record more segments and\n\n68\n00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:20.495\nchuck it on there, but otherwise, we're\nkinda covering the basic stuff that you're\n\n69\n00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.665\ngonna need to implement an ASA\nsuccessfully, in production.\n\n70\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.162\nThat's basically it.\n\n71\n00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:26.830\n>> All right, with that,\n\n72\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.060\nthat means we are ready to begin\nour series on the Cisco ASA.\n\n73\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.390\nWe're glad you're with us.\n\n74\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.870\nStay tuned for more ASA content.\n\n75\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.559\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
