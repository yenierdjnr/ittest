Hi Daniel,\nit's good to be back here again.\n\n7\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.715\nSo, the CISM is one of four\ncertifications of ISAKA offers\n\n8\n00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:38.949\nthe certified information security\nmanager really is designed for\n\n9\n00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.529\nindividuals who wanna\nfurther their career,\n\n10\n00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:48.337\nup the food chain if you will in security\nto begin to manage security teams.\n\n11\n00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:53.651\nSo, this is not an audit certification,\nit doesn't,\n\n12\n00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:58.625\nthe CIA or\nother certifications that ISAKA offer not\n\n13\n00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:03.760\na prerequisite to becoming\nCIA seems certified.\n\n14\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.900\nThis is really designed for\nthose individuals who have been in IT and\n\n15\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.040\nIT security.\n\n16\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.190\nMaybe you have an audit background like I\ndid, maybe you don't, it doesn't matter,\n\n17\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.640\nit's not required.\n\n18\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.550\nBut you wanna move up the chain\na little bit more, and\n\n19\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.340\nget a little more experience\nin background and\n\n20\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.290\nunderstanding of all the kinds of aspects\nof what a security manager might do.\n\n21\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.320\nIt's also a great stepping stone to\nthe CISO position if you will for\n\n22\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320\nthose who wanna go from\nsecurity management, and\n\n23\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.215\nwanna continue your query on,\nand move the management ladder.\n\n24\n00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:38.990\nThen may begin working as\ninformation security officer or\n\n25\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.800\nchief information security officers for\norganization.\n\n26\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.360\nIt's also good certification for\nthose people in audit or\n\n27\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460\nin risk management to get\na better understanding.\n\n28\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.500\nAnd a feel for what security managers\ndo the kind of challenges that they\n\n29\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.590\nface in particular in order to be\na more grounded stakeholder for\n\n30\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.350\nthose security management programs, so\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, when it comes\n\n31\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.400\nto the content of our upcoming series\nwhat can we expect generally and\n\n32\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.660\nthen give us some specifics, if you could.\n\n33\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, so there are four domains in\nthe certified information security manager\n\n34\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.640\narena, the biggest one\nbeing program development.\n\n35\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.000\nSo again, this really is a,\nI wanna call it a management level\n\n36\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.340\ncourse in certification it's this is not\nabout how to use a firewall in a network.\n\n37\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.260\nThis is not about how to\nimplement group policies.\n\n38\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.800\nThis is about things like,\nhow do you develop a security,\n\n39\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.850\na written security program?\n\n40\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.810\nIn an organization especially\nan enterprise organization.\n\n41\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.020\nI will say that ISACA\ncertifications are all built around\n\n42\n00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.530\nwhat we were called enterprise\nlevel environments.\n\n43\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.350\nSo, some of it maybe a bit of stretch for\n\n44\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.250\nsecurity management working in\nsmaller environments that are let's\n\n45\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.220\nsay below 500 users that aren't\nnecessarily international.\n\n46\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.235\nISACA is an international\norganization that we have over 118,\n\n47\n00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.670\n20,000 members,\nsomething like that in 85 countries.\n\n48\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.060\nSo, they're used to talking and\n\n49\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.380\nestablishing training programs\naround very large organizations.\n\n50\n00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.800\nSo if you were become certified as\nan Information Security Manager,\n\n51\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.885\nyou should be adequately prepared to\ngo to work in a very large enterprise\n\n52\n00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:28.240\nwhere even on an international level.\n\n53\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.450\nIn terms of understanding\nthe foundations and\n\n54\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.670\ninner pinnings of an effective\ninformation security management program.\n\n55\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.350\nHowever, you don't have to work\nin one that big to be able to\n\n56\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.535\nget some benefit out of the program,\netcetera.\n\n57\n00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:45.565\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\nI only have one more question for you and\n\n58\n00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:48.655\nthat is could you please explain\nsome of the procedures and\n\n59\n00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:54.320\nthings we can expect as we're preparing\nfor the exam, and about the exam itself?\n\n60\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.385\n&gt;&gt; Well, so the exam is 200 questions,\nit's four hours long.\n\n61\n00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:03.255\nIn our very first in our\nother introductory episode,\n\n62\n00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:08.980\nI talk a little bit about how to\nprepare for the exam more effectively.\n\n63\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.750\nIt's a tough exam,\nyou really should prepare for this.\n\n64\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.850\nThis is not one of those even if you've\nbeen doing security for a number of years.\n\n65\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.880\nDon't expect to walk in and pass this exam\ncuz you're not going to, I guarantee you.\n\n66\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.290\nIt's tough, it is a real tough exam.\n\n67\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.220\nYou really have to know your stuff.\n\n68\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.180\nThe questions are multiple choice, and\n\n69\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.230\nthey cover topics everywhere from program\ndevelopment and design to forensic\n\n70\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.128\nevidence collection to disaster recovery\nand business continuity planning.\n\n71\n00:04:35.128 --> 00:04:39.470\nAnd you we're gonna have to\nknow a very wide breadth of\n\n72\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.890\ninformation in order to be\na successful candidate.\n\n73\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff well,\nBrian we thank you again,\n\n74\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.680\nwe're looking forward to seeing\nyou in those upcoming episodes.\n\n75\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.200\nAnd if that sounds like something\nyou might be interested in or\n\n76\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.510\nyou need to get that CISM for,\nwhatever purpose is,\n\n77\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.083\nwe look forward to seeing you\nin the upcoming series as well.\n\n78\n00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:03.268\n[SOUND]\n\n",
