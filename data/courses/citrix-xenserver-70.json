ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.785\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n5\n00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.500\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.790\nAs you already may know,\ntechnology evolves quite quickly.\n\n7\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.830\nAnd, well, when new technology updates we\nneed to know about additional features\n\n8\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.360\nthat may come and how to use the new\nfeatures that are available.\n\n9\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.510\nSo with us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios\n\n10\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.190\nto show us the upgrades available\nwith Citrix XenServer version 7.0.\n\n11\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.120\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.301\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe get started now into a new show, which\n\n13\n00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:48.599\nis, of course, gonna be an introduction\nhere into Citrix XenServer 7.0.\n\n14\n00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:50.535\nAs of the recording of this show,\n\n15\n00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:55.599\nthe newest version came out probably about\nMay of the previous year, May of 2016.\n\n16\n00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.371\nWhat they've chosen to do is advance a lot\nof the features that the industry has\n\n17\n00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:02.620\npretty much been asking for.\n\n18\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.320\nSo we're gonna take advantage of that,\n\n19\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.440\nat least in showing you and talking to\nyou about some of those features and\n\n20\n00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.640\nthen show you how to get\nstarted with ZenServer as well.\n\n21\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.400\nBut when we begin, we don't wanna\njust make an automatic assumption\n\n22\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.230\nthat everybody knows about Citrix\nXenServer or even about virtualization.\n\n23\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.400\nSo we're gonna do a little bit of a primer\non virtualization at the beginning.\n\n24\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.230\nAnd then we'll talk about some of these\ndifferent features that we can find inside\n\n25\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.240\nof XenServer.\n\n26\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.220\nAnd why it may be a consideration for\nyou in the place that you're working,\n\n27\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.710\nin comparison to other types of\nvirtualization software out there such as\n\n28\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.570\nVMware, ESX, as well as even Hyper-V\nthat you may encounter as well.\n\n29\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.180\nSo that's what we wanna\nmake sure that we do.\n\n30\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.440\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie,\nare you gonna set us straight here and\n\n31\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.510\nexplain exactly what ZenServer is?\n\n32\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.880\n&gt;&gt; We're hopefully going to make sure\nthat we understand all the components\n\n33\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.540\ninvolved in there and\nwhat it actually really is.\n\n34\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.300\nSo when it comes down to what\nZenServer really does for\n\n35\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.520\nus, it is that virtualization\nplatform that we can use\n\n36\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.000\ninside of a business to\nvirtualize our servers.\n\n37\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.710\nNow, that's where we have to get and\nmake sure that everybody understands it.\n\n38\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.010\nAt least a base knowledge of\nvirtualization at the beginning.\n\n39\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.030\nSo let's start right there and\n\n40\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.192\nthen we'll move towards where\nzen server is gonna lead us.\n\n41\n00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:18.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so virtualization,\nyou hear this term thrown out a lot.\n\n42\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.970\nIt's really trendy for lot of businesses\nbut Ronnie why is it so trendy?\n\n43\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.490\nWhy does it matter in\ntoday's business environment?\n\n44\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.520\n&gt;&gt; It matters in multiple ways here.\n\n45\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.510\nSo let's make sure that we have\nthis solid understanding and\n\n46\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.120\nthen we'll move that way about why it\nreally matters, especially in business.\n\n47\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.150\nIt's more about efficiency and\ncost, as well as about\n\n48\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.780\nwhat we call high optimization or\nhigh utilization inside of business.\n\n49\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.870\nAnd we'll see why this\nis a great platform for\n\n50\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770\nus, especially in the cost\nidea in just a moment.\n\n51\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.350\nSo, let's take a look at my screen, and\nthis will get us started right away.\n\n52\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.640\nI know if you're watching this,\n\n53\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.560\nyou're probably saying,\nwe don't need this at the beginning.\n\n54\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.360\nBut let's just make sure we're all on\nthe right foot as we get started here.\n\n55\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.090\nRemember that when you and I are working\nat a regular work station, or\n\n56\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.930\nmaybe even still working on servers in\n\n57\n00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.010\nthe way that we normally have been\nbrought up to work on is fairly simple.\n\n58\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.070\nWe have machinery, we have a single\nserver, we have a single PC, and\n\n59\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.960\nthen we install an operating\nsystem directly on top of it.\n\n60\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.260\nSo here I've shown an example of a PC.\n\n61\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.080\nWe have the underlying\nhardware representing And\n\n62\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.230\nthen right here and\nthen inside underneath that, right?\n\n63\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.970\nYou can break down the individual\ncomponents that you see.\n\n64\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.550\nBut residing on top of that\nis the operating system.\n\n65\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.780\nThe operating system is how you\ninteract with the hardware.\n\n66\n00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.640\nAs well as with software\napplications that can run\n\n67\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.650\ninside of the operating system as well.\n\n68\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.670\nSo you need to access\nsome type of application,\n\n69\n00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.710\nyou generally go to\nthe operating system and\n\n70\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.840\nif you're in Windows you kind of point and\nclick at it and now an application runs.\n\n71\n00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.080\nYou need to print something, okay.\n\n72\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.590\nYou go and you select that application,\nyou go to File and Print.\n\n73\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.430\nWell the application interacts\nwith the operating system.\n\n74\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.470\nAt that point interact with\nhardware to send a print job\n\n75\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.340\nout to wherever it needs to go.\n\n76\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.640\nThat's kind of the way that we've been\nworking with computers pretty much for\n\n77\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.520\na very long time.\n\n78\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.230\nAnd if you think about\nthat the result is simple.\n\n79\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.210\nA single operating system then controls\n\n80\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.010\nall the access to all\nthe available hardware.\n\n81\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.800\nAnd that's fine and that's great.\n\n82\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.010\nThat's something that we've all done,\nand it's no real big surprise, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.800\nBut most organizations, then,\nthey do what we call overprovisioning.\n\n84\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.270\nNow that's a fancy word.\n\n85\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.150\nWhat they mean is that they\nhave too many resources for\n\n86\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.270\njust doing something relatively simple.\n\n87\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.710\nSo you might end up seeing this,\na lot of times,\n\n88\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.520\ninside of an organization that may say,\nI have\n\n89\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.060\na domain controller as well as a separate\nDHCP server and a separate DNS server.\n\n90\n00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.020\nWell each one of those,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n91\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.010\nthey're individual servers and\nthat can run.\n\n92\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.970\nBut what if we could run\nthose particular servers\n\n93\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.490\nall on one machine at the same time?\n\n94\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.310\nSo that's what we're actually talking\nabout is the ability to do that,\n\n95\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.930\nand to have them all running\non the same machine.\n\n96\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.340\nYou might be saying well Ronnie,\nif I'm running Windows Server 2012, for\n\n97\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.750\nexample, when I install Active Directory,\n\n98\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.080\nit tells me I should be running\nDNS on this machine as well.\n\n99\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.000\nAnd can I do that, yes.\n\n100\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.940\nWe're not talking about this idea of\njust putting those roles together and\n\n101\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.180\ncombining them as one server.\n\n102\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.020\nWhat we're saying is,\nwhat if I needed to separate them out?\n\n103\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.720\nWhat if I wanted to ensure\nthat my DNS servers were\n\n104\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.380\nseparate from my Active Directory,\nwere separate from my domain controller?\n\n105\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.020\nSo that they're actually working\nas individual machines and\n\n106\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.410\nthat we've separated out the roles but\nI can still run them on the same machine.\n\n107\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.210\nAnd that is what we call the idea\nof consolidation which we'll get to\n\n108\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.720\nhere too, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.980\nBut this point that's we\nwanna make sure of, okay.\n\n110\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.840\nMost of the time individual\nworks stations as well,\n\n111\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.600\nare kinda big consumer\nof all the hardware.\n\n112\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.260\nImagine just a regular desktop PC today,\n\n113\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.090\nyou might see, especially in today\nas of the recording right now,\n\n114\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.810\nthat a machine that has four gigs of RAM,\nthat has a 500 gig hard drive or so,\n\n115\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.220\nis kinda considered underpowered if it's\nnot running like an I5 core processor.\n\n116\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.110\nSo it's really strange because about ten\nyears ago or even five years ago, we would\n\n117\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.530\nhave thought that would have been a little\nbit overwhelming, just even for a server.\n\n118\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.700\nIf you had something like that on\na server probably about ten years ago,\n\n119\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.950\nit'd probably be not the bleeding edge,\nbut at least right in the middle there\n\n120\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.580\nwhere you're like, four gigs, that's quite\na bit of RAM for a particular server.\n\n121\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.890\nBut overall a regular\ndesktop can consume that and\n\n122\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.640\na regular desktop is running that most\nof the time like we said really for\n\n123\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.890\nbrowsing the actual using web browser and\nthen getting your email.\n\n124\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.955\nAnd as much as your email\ncan be overwhelming,\n\n125\n00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:51.835\nthat's still a lot of power behind running\njust a couple of applications here.\n\n126\n00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:54.795\nSo it's very important that we\nunderstand that the concept of\n\n127\n00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:56.235\nvirtualization and what it does.\n\n128\n00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:59.145\nWhen we start talking\nabout virtualization,\n\n129\n00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:04.635\nessentially what we end up doing here is\nthat we do a couple of different things.\n\n130\n00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:05.665\nI clicked on the wrong one.\n\n131\n00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.845\nLet's talk about the idea\nof consolidation instead.\n\n132\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.050\nConsolidation allows me then,\nto take one set of hardware, so\n\n133\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.640\na single machine, or\na single server, run what we call,\n\n134\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.710\nsome type of virtual Machine monitor,\nor a hypervisor, and\n\n135\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.900\nthen I can install multiple operating\nsystems on the same machine.\n\n136\n00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.170\nYou can think about this as being\nlike carpooling for computers, okay,\n\n137\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.600\nmore than anything else.\n\n138\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.550\nYou're all in the same car,\nyou're all going to same location here.\n\n139\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.430\nBut we're literally\nsaying the same hardware\n\n140\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.790\ncan literally run all of those different\nvirtual machines together, and\n\n141\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.490\nwhen we do that it really helps now\nbecause now we can fully utilize\n\n142\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.470\nall the resources that are available\nright here on that one machine.\n\n143\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.902\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was gonna say,\nRonnie.\n\n144\n00:07:50.902 --> 00:07:55.585\nIt looks like we're really taking\nadvantage of the full functionality of\n\n145\n00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.072\nthe system, or\nyour car if you wanna use that analogy.\n\n146\n00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:02.253\nAnd if we look at just\none individual system,\n\n147\n00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:07.590\nmaybe we had 40% of that machine\nthat we weren't using originally.\n\n148\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.680\nWell, now that we apply additional\nmachines, we can go ahead and\n\n149\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.440\nuse that physical machine\nto its full capacity.\n\n150\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.940\nBut imagine the exponential savings that\nwe could have if we're talking about\n\n151\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.708\nhundreds or\neven thousands of machines here.\n\n152\n00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:25.104\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt, cuz as you start\nto run more and more VMs on them,\n\n153\n00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:27.899\nyou are kind of dividing up the resources.\n\n154\n00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:32.098\nBut you're really utilizing the resources\nto its fullest potential to be able\n\n155\n00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:32.612\nto do so.\n\n156\n00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:37.341\nAnd this is what most organizations are\ndoing regardless of whether you know about\n\n157\n00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:41.796\nit or not So if this is your first entry\ninto the realm of virtualization, this\n\n158\n00:08:41.796 --> 00:08:46.990\nis something that you're gonna get used\nto, is what you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n159\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.370\nSo consolidation is a big part of it.\n\n160\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.220\nBut remember the other part that\nI mentioned about the nature\n\n161\n00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.560\nof Active Directory, and\ninstead of running the roles together and\n\n162\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.530\ncombine together,\nWe can separate them out as well.\n\n163\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.140\nSo let's take a look at\nthis particular drawing,\n\n164\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.390\nwhere what I've done here is\nshowed you the same thing.\n\n165\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.970\nBoth of these virtual machines,\n\n166\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.730\nif I wanted to, I can put them on\nthe same IP network if I choose to.\n\n167\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.780\nBut I can also have them separated.\n\n168\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.860\nSo even though they are running within the\nsame virtual machine or the same hardware,\n\n169\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.800\nexcuse me, as individual virtual machines,\nI can segment them or I can segregate\n\n170\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.270\nthem to the point where they\nare completely isolated from one another.\n\n171\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.950\nNow, it used to be,\nI'm gonna say probably now,\n\n172\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.120\nit's gotta be close to ten years ago,\nright?\n\n173\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.459\nIt would have been an impossibility at\nthat point when we said there is no way.\n\n174\n00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:43.251\nIf I wanted to separate these two out,\n\n175\n00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:46.051\nthere is no way you could\nactually cross that boundary, but\n\n176\n00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:50.035\nbecause people have gotten smarter over\nthe years and hackers have gotten smarter.\n\n177\n00:09:50.035 --> 00:09:54.630\nThere are ways that this is done, but\nit's still very difficult to do so.\n\n178\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:00.390\nIf your business, I'm trying to remember\nwhat that word is, if your business or\n\n179\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.960\nyour company is using some type of\ncloud storage that's out there, well,\n\n180\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.090\nyou're probably running a lot of\nyour infrastructure then on these\n\n181\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.500\nvirtual machines.\n\n182\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.190\nAnd unusually, which is something that we\nall kind of fear, is that your competitor\n\n183\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.630\ncould actually have a virtual machine\non that same physical server and\n\n184\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.020\nyou don't even know about it.\n\n185\n00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.790\nAnd that is because they isolate\nit out to different tenants\n\n186\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.540\nthat can also use that same\npiece of hardware, but\n\n187\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.250\nseparate them to the point where\nthey cannot cross those boundaries.\n\n188\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.880\nSo just realized that this is the nature\nand the way that the world is moving,\n\n189\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.600\nwhen we start to take a look here, okay.\n\n190\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.070\nSo in comparison, when you kind of compare\nthe differences between these, right.\n\n191\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.250\nRemember that without virtualization,\nthis is a single system and\n\n192\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.270\nyou have the idea of one host,\nwhich is gonna be our hardware.\n\n193\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.470\nWith that operating system and then we can\nrun the apps that we want to, but it's\n\n194\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:57.400\nreally under the control of really that\nidea of this one system doing everything.\n\n195\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.130\nInside of a virtual environment,\nwe run the physical hardware,\n\n196\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.480\nbut notice now I can run multiple\ndifferent systems on top of them, and\n\n197\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.520\nit really allows us to be able\nto do that high utilization.\n\n198\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.360\nAllows me to be able to still isolate them\n\n199\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.620\nas of their separate individual\nservers that I choose to.\n\n200\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.390\nOr I can consolidate them together for\nthe idea of high optimization or\n\n201\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.920\nhigh utilization of the hardware\nthat's available, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.060\nSo all this is actually key in terms\nof understanding virtualization.\n\n203\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.454\nNow you might be saying, all right,\nso now that we've got that,\n\n204\n00:11:32.454 --> 00:11:36.163\nXenServer obviously has to do with\nsomething with virtualization, so\n\n205\n00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:37.921\nwhy should I choose this as well?\n\n206\n00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:42.933\nWell, Cherokee mentioned earlier that one\nof the things that really is helpful is,\n\n207\n00:11:42.933 --> 00:11:46.674\ninstead of having to buy a brand\nnew server for this Windows OS or\n\n208\n00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:50.060\nthis Linux OS here, and\nthen install them into my rack and\n\n209\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.954\nthen put an operating\nsystem on each one of them,\n\n210\n00:11:52.954 --> 00:11:57.008\nI really only have to buy one that\nhas enough hardware that it needs.\n\n211\n00:11:57.008 --> 00:12:01.900\nSo it can be able to utilize\nall the stuff that it needs to.\n\n212\n00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.620\nWell, that's fine, but\nit actually does save a lot of money.\n\n213\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.500\nNow, once we do that,\n\n214\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.080\nwe save a lot of money in the hardware\npurchase, which is great.\n\n215\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.570\nCuz it means we spend a lot less money.\n\n216\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.700\nWe also reduce what's called TCO,\ntotal cost of ownership as well.\n\n217\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.890\nBut the other thing about Citrix\nXenServer, unlike some of the other things\n\n218\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.670\nyou see out there, is that it's\nan open source implementation.\n\n219\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.020\nSo that means you can get\nthis almost 100% free.\n\n220\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.030\nNow not everything is\nabsolutely 100% free.\n\n221\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.940\nSome of the features that we're\ngonna talk about in this show,\n\n222\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.660\nin this particular episode,\nare not gonna be 100% free.\n\n223\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.440\nBut the majority of them,\nas far as getting started and\n\n224\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.260\nbeing on the managed servers,\nit pretty much is.\n\n225\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.977\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, if I understand what you\nare telling me here, we're taking one\n\n226\n00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:55.177\nphysical machine, which is great, because\nI can even save with my electricity costs,\n\n227\n00:12:55.177 --> 00:12:58.639\nmy physical space inside of my building,\nand I'm slicing up all of these\n\n228\n00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:03.170\nhardware resources and allocating them\nto those different virtual machines.\n\n229\n00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.620\nBut what happens if I\nhave a hardware failure?\n\n230\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.500\nIs that something I\nshould be concerned with?\n\n231\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is something that you're\ndefinitely going to be concerned with, so\n\n232\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.850\njust like anything else, right.\n\n233\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.300\nInside of your business, you've gotta\nlook for single points of failure.\n\n234\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.251\nAll of your virtual machines\nreside on one piece\n\n235\n00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:24.103\nof hardware that is gonna be\nyour single point of failure.\n\n236\n00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:27.672\nSo, inside of these\nvirtualization technologies,\n\n237\n00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:32.747\nyou normally have the ability to do\nwhat we call clustering, which helps and\n\n238\n00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:37.899\nalso to remove the VMs that we tend to run\nfrom the local storage on to different\n\n239\n00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:43.799\ntypes of storage devices, which we're also\ngonna get into in this show as well, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:47.360\nSo we want to actually be able to do\nthat one of the key aspects of doing\n\n241\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.179\nthis, right?\n\n242\n00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:50.996\nLet's go and\ntake a look at my screen again,\n\n243\n00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.980\nis that inside of\na virtualized environment?\n\n244\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.131\nIf we set it up correctly in a cluster,\n\n245\n00:13:56.131 --> 00:13:58.700\nwhich means that they\ncan operate together.\n\n246\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.473\nWhat we can do here, is that we literally\ncan have it what they are working almost\n\n247\n00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:08.045\nin a heart beat configuration, so\nthat they know exactly what's going on.\n\n248\n00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:11.884\nThat if this machine,\nover here on the left,\n\n249\n00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:16.634\nsenses that there's a failure,\nwe can take this guy and\n\n250\n00:14:16.634 --> 00:14:20.799\nactually have it migrate\nover to the other side.\n\n251\n00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:24.485\nAnd that way it goes onto a server that\nnow says, hey I'm up and running and\n\n252\n00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:25.628\neverything's good.\n\n253\n00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:28.170\nAnd then we can start\nworking on the migration for\n\n254\n00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.085\nthe other one to move over to\na different server as well.\n\n255\n00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:34.790\nThese servers even have the ability to\nessentially do load balancing between\n\n256\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.324\nthem, where they know what machines\nactually are available that they can\n\n257\n00:14:38.324 --> 00:14:41.973\nmove these to, depending on the resource\nusage that's also there as well.\n\n258\n00:14:41.973 --> 00:14:45.250\nSo there's a lot of benefits\nin terms of virtualization.\n\n259\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.936\nIt now gives us that ability\nto have that same idea,\n\n260\n00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:53.860\nokay, that we really do strive for,\nespecially in business.\n\n261\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.750\nSo lower total cost of ownership,\nthe ability to do some type of migration,\n\n262\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.610\nwhether it's called live migration,\n\n263\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.730\nwhich you don't even notice\nthat the machine's going down.\n\n264\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.850\nThat virtual machine automatically\ntransfers over to another one.\n\n265\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.850\nOr the idea of idle.\n\n266\n00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.173\nIsolation, which I can't remember.\n\n267\n00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:15.571\nAnd consolidation, all of that's possible,\nwith the virtualization technology that we\n\n268\n00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:20.230\nhave, that we're gonna be talking about,\nespecially with Citrix ZenServer.\n\n269\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.760\nSo you might be wondering, all right, so\nthere's so many products out there, right?\n\n270\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.600\nThere is Microsoft Hyper-V,\nwhich is a very popular product,\n\n271\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.600\nby far the king of the market, okay,\nhands down, right, it's gonna be VMware's,\n\n272\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:40.550\nthey're a particular brand of ESX or ESXI,\n\n273\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:46.180\nthose are also types of the virtualization\nsoftware or hypervisors we can talk about.\n\n274\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.140\nAnd then there is also Citrix ZenServer,\nthere's KBM.\n\n275\n00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.030\nThere is a lot of different\nones that are out there.\n\n276\n00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.961\nWhat makes this special, and why should\nwe choose to do something like this?\n\n277\n00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:59.450\nWell, these particular types of\nhypervisors that I'm mentioning,\n\n278\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.234\nwhich is the virtualization Technology,\nthe software that lies in between\n\n279\n00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:08.140\nthe hardware and, of course, the VMs that\nwe're gonna run, the virtual machines.\n\n280\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.360\nWell, they literally run\ndirectly on top of the hardware.\n\n281\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.340\nIn the past,\nthe earliest virtualization that we had\n\n282\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.210\navailable to us were what we\ncalled type 2 hypervisors.\n\n283\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.480\nSo let's take a look at my screen and that\nway we'll get this good sense here, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.560\nSo when we start talking about the idea\nof type 2 hypervisors, what we can\n\n285\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.340\nend up seeing here on the screen is that\nwe'll notice that there's hardware, but\n\n286\n00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.600\nit normally began where we installed\nwhatever operating system that\n\n287\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.950\nwe were gonna install.\n\n288\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.720\nAnd then we could run\nwhatever we wanted to.\n\n289\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.310\nNow the first one that I actually\nencountered was before what was called\n\n290\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.290\nMicrosoft PC 2007.\n\n291\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.460\nIt still exists as a product.\n\n292\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.860\nWhen I ran it-\n&gt;&gt; Virtual PC?\n\n293\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:56.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was called now it's called or\nused to be called Microsoft Virtual PC.\n\n294\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.910\nBut yeah,\nthe edition that I ran was I think\n\n295\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.240\nfrom 2005 when I first encountered it.\n\n296\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.510\nThen there's Oracle VirtualBox, VMware\nWorkstation, Microsoft Virtual Server\n\n297\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.570\n2005, and of course VMware Fusion,\nand then there's Parallels.\n\n298\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:16.500\nThese are all different examples that\ncan run inside of your operating system,\n\n299\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.540\nessentially as applications, and\n\n300\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.310\nstill do the same type of virtualization\nthat we're talking about now, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.370\nNow the reason why we choose\nthe other ones instead is\n\n302\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:33.730\nnow take a look, notice that there is\nno underlying host operating system.\n\n303\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.280\nSo that means I don't have to take away\nresources to run an operating system.\n\n304\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.020\nI can directly just run\nthe virtual machine monitor or\n\n305\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.130\nthe hypervisor at this point.\n\n306\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.850\nAnd then I can run my operating systems\ndirectly on top of this one, and\n\n307\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.580\nthat way I can actually utilize more\nresources for the VMs that I'm running.\n\n308\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.460\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, Ronnie.\n\n309\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.280\nIf we take a look at even just the history\nof virtualization, I think it was what,\n\n310\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.770\nin the 70's, that virtualization was\nreally being used by companies like IBM.\n\n311\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.370\nBut it wasn't very\nproficient in that sense.\n\n312\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.310\nBut here, what you just showed us,\nespecially with the different types,\n\n313\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.360\nthe newer types of hypervisors, our\nsystems can communicate directly with that\n\n314\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.660\nhardware to really speed up\nthe way everything functions.\n\n315\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.610\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n316\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.140\nIt really allows for\nthe aspect here of being able to do that\n\n317\n00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.710\nhigh utilization that we've been\nstressing over and over again.\n\n318\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.183\nAnd now these machines run so efficiently\nby comparison that most of us will\n\n319\n00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:34.050\nnever know that it's actually inside\nof a virtualized environment.\n\n320\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:34.860\nAnd tell you the truth,\n\n321\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.190\nin most virtualized environments,\nthe operating system that's running\n\n322\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.490\ndoesn't know it's actually using\nvirtualized hardware at all.\n\n323\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.420\nSo it really thinks that\nit's in its own machine,\n\n324\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.570\nit doesn't have any clue\nthat it's different.\n\n325\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.650\nAnd that's because we have\nhardware abstraction going on.\n\n326\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.350\nAnd that's what the hypervisor does.\n\n327\n00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.277\nIt does what we call hardware abstraction\nto essentially report to those VMs here's\n\n328\n00:18:54.277 --> 00:18:56.650\nthe hardware that's available to you.\n\n329\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.070\nBut it doesn't really give them\ndirect access to the hardware at all.\n\n330\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.083\nIt all happens through that idea\nof that hypervisor 2, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:04.083 --> 00:19:09.490\nSo, if we're gonna pick one, why in\nthe world would we choose to use XenServe?\n\n332\n00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.220\nAnd that's what we wanted to get down to.\n\n333\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.030\nSo all the products that dare out\nthere that everybody chooses to use,\n\n334\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.390\nthey normally pay for them.\n\n335\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.610\nThey normally are feeling very\ncomfortable with them, and that's fine.\n\n336\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.060\nBut you'll find something that all of\nthose features are available, even in\n\n337\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.740\na product that you generally don't have to\nreally spend a lot of money paying for.\n\n338\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.430\nNow, if you want some of\nthe advanced features,\n\n339\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.790\nin which we'll talk about\nhere in just a moment.\n\n340\n00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.640\nYes, you will have to get an Enterprise\nlevel subscription through Citrix.\n\n341\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.500\nBut overall, though,\n\n342\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.928\nif you need simple virtualization\nthat can handle quite a bit, okay?\n\n343\n00:19:41.928 --> 00:19:48.380\nWith 7.0, the incredible requirements\nthat we'll take a look here at the end,\n\n344\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.610\nyou'll see that it just opens the\nopportunities beyond what anyone has ever\n\n345\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.830\nthought of, in terms of making sure that\nVMs can run the way they want to, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.500\nSo, there is also what we call\na XenServer and a Xen Project.\n\n347\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.830\nLet's make sure that we\ndon't confuse those two.\n\n348\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:10.670\nThe Xen Project is the open source kinda\nfoundation of the hypervisor itself.\n\n349\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.390\nSo, Citrix essentially went and found and\n\n350\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.940\nsaid hey, here's what we want to\nuse which is that Xen Project.\n\n351\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:23.290\nAnd that is their underlying\ntechnology that makes everything work.\n\n352\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.870\nAnd because it's open source,\nthey don't charge anything for it.\n\n353\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.950\nBut XenServer itself includes\nan additional enhancements,\n\n354\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.820\nwhich then you can control.\n\n355\n00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.790\nAnd you can add in additional\nfeatures that make\n\n356\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.600\nit easier to actually be able to use,\nof course, the underlying hypervisor.\n\n357\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.410\nSo that's really what the difference is.\n\n358\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.670\nSo, in ZenServer, you may have to pay for\nsome additional enhancements.\n\n359\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.130\nIn Zen Project, you don't.\n\n360\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.170\nYou can go out there today and\nactually go to the Zen Project website.\n\n361\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.078\nAnd be able to download that if you choose\nto and run it exactly as a hypervisor.\n\n362\n00:20:58.078 --> 00:21:02.420\nBut there's no real management console,\nit's all done through a command prompt.\n\n363\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.740\nSo you just realize that you have a lot\nof stuff that you have to deal with when\n\n364\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.150\nyou start taking a look, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.670\nSo what is the big benefit then when we\nstart coming into the realm of XenServe?\n\n366\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.240\nWell, XenServer now also includes in what\n\n367\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.140\nthey call something is called\nthe control domain or Dom0.\n\n368\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.230\nNow this is saying that what they've\ndone is that they've made the hypervisor\n\n369\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:31.600\nmanagement a lot easier by really building\nkind of a small virtualized environment\n\n370\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.110\nin which all of the interaction\ngoes through, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.150\nSo everything that's managed\ninside of the hypervisor itself\n\n372\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.040\nalso comes through this\nmanagement as well.\n\n373\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.195\nAnd we can connect to that using\nsomething that we call XenCenter.\n\n374\n00:21:43.195 --> 00:21:47.875\nWhich we'll show you how, we get into\nthe show where we do an installation.\n\n375\n00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:50.575\nWe also, of course,\nhave that XenCenter, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:54.945\nAnd this is gonna be for\nmanaging the clients that we run inside,\n\n377\n00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:57.215\nof course, of XenServer itself.\n\n378\n00:21:57.215 --> 00:22:00.515\nAs well as being able to do\nthings like clustering, or\n\n379\n00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:03.500\nbeing able to do things like NIC bonding.\n\n380\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.685\nOr making our Xen servers be able to\nconnect to external storage devices.\n\n381\n00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:12.510\nXen Center helps us to do that with\na nice graphical user interface and\n\n382\n00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.100\nit makes it fairly intuitive for\nus to do that as well, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.120\nThey also include in inside of\nXenServer different templates so you\n\n384\n00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.620\ndon't have to go through and say I don't\nknow, I'm building this type of machine.\n\n385\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.742\nHow much RAM, how much storage\nshould I initially give it?\n\n386\n00:22:27.742 --> 00:22:30.940\nWell XenCenter can help you do that\nthrough the templates that are available,\n\n387\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.930\nwhich are really helpful,\nget you started a lot quicker as well.\n\n388\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.450\nAnd then of course,\nthere's the storage manager,\n\n389\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.805\nwhich there's multiple types of different\nstorage arrays that you can get into.\n\n390\n00:22:42.805 --> 00:22:46.100\nSANs is pretty much kinda the big one,\nas well.\n\n391\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.566\nOf course you can even use local storage\nif you choose to do that, too, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:50.566 --> 00:22:54.210\nThere's some software-defined\nnetwork virtualization.\n\n393\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.200\nYou name it, there's a lot of different\nways that we can pool together\n\n394\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.080\nthe resources that we need.\n\n395\n00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.790\nAnd ZenCenter and ZenServer itself, that's\nkind of a key on why would you do that.\n\n396\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.620\nNow is that really any different from\nall the other products, no, okay.\n\n397\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.980\nBut it shows you that they're\nat least on par, right?\n\n398\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.090\nThat XenServer, even though it's a\nrelatively free product and you can go and\n\n399\n00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:19.990\ndownload it from Citrix itself,\nthat you can download the XenCenter.\n\n400\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.540\nYou can download the standard edition\nof XenServer and have it up and\n\n401\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.020\nrunning relatively quickly, and\nstill be able to do a lot of things you\n\n402\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.790\nmight have to pay for if you go into\nlike the vSphere Management and\n\n403\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.040\nyou start setting up something like that.\n\n404\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.320\nOr into even in the Hyper-V Management,\na little bit more clunky there, but\n\n405\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.230\nyou can still work with it there, too.\n\n406\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.160\nSo what makes this different, okay,\n\n407\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.390\nwhen it comes down to the idea\nof XenServer here, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.835\nWell, there's gonna be\nan enterprise level management.\n\n409\n00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:56.669\nAnd a lot of the features that they\nactually offer are now in 7.0, okay,\n\n410\n00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.525\nreally have to do with that.\n\n411\n00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:02.333\nAnd that means it's gonna be\npaid things that you have, but\n\n412\n00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:05.608\nThey have really done a ton\nof things that has said,\n\n413\n00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:10.127\nI want to be in the virtualization\nmarket for Windows servers, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:10.127 --> 00:24:12.572\nThat's really what they've decided to do.\n\n415\n00:24:12.572 --> 00:24:16.657\nSo one of the things that they said is,\nwe wanna make sure that all of our\n\n416\n00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:21.440\nvirtualization technologies, that the\nautomatic updates that happen inside of\n\n417\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.386\nvirtual machines, inside of XenServer,\nthey can be done very easily here, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:26.386 --> 00:24:31.222\nSo automated Windows VM drivers,\nall that stuff, XenServer says, yep,\n\n419\n00:24:31.222 --> 00:24:33.692\nwe went ahead and integrated that in.\n\n420\n00:24:33.692 --> 00:24:36.595\nAnd that just makes it easier for\nanybody trying to run Windows,\n\n421\n00:24:36.595 --> 00:24:38.315\nin that they're wondering whether or\n\n422\n00:24:38.315 --> 00:24:41.340\nnot they have the hardware\ncompatibility to do it, it can be done.\n\n423\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.197\n&gt;&gt; Now that sounds kind of like\nthe integration services that\n\n424\n00:24:44.197 --> 00:24:45.194\nMicrosoft offers.\n\n425\n00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:48.944\nSo just knowing that different\nvendors may have some terms,\n\n426\n00:24:48.944 --> 00:24:52.041\ndo I need to be too hung\nup on those terms, Ronnie?\n\n427\n00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.954\nI see that a lot in\ndifferent technologies,\n\n428\n00:24:53.954 --> 00:24:57.591\nbut how do we feel about that here in this\nparticular virtualization environment?\n\n429\n00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:58.642\n&gt;&gt; Not really, right?\n\n430\n00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:02.482\nThe very fact is XenServer just says,\nlook, we just wanna make it easier for\n\n431\n00:25:02.482 --> 00:25:05.192\nWindows servers to be able\nto run in our environment.\n\n432\n00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:09.625\nSo what they did is that they bettered\ntheir drivers, right, for the input and\n\n433\n00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:13.119\noutput drivers that we normally\nwould see inside of Windows,\n\n434\n00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.358\nto make it work better with XenServer.\n\n435\n00:25:15.358 --> 00:25:17.722\nAnd they made sure that they come\nthrough the automatic updates.\n\n436\n00:25:17.722 --> 00:25:19.564\nWhich means, you don't have to go out and\n\n437\n00:25:19.564 --> 00:25:21.731\nhunt a particular type of\ndriver to make it work.\n\n438\n00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:24.682\nThey went ahead and said look, let's\nwork with Windows to make that happen.\n\n439\n00:25:24.682 --> 00:25:25.238\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n440\n00:25:25.238 --> 00:25:28.807\n&gt;&gt; Another one that's really good and\nwe're gonna get to as well,\n\n441\n00:25:28.807 --> 00:25:32.839\nwe can only talk about these,\ncuz I don't have the Enterprise edition,\n\n442\n00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:36.116\nis that they try to make\nthe VMs look great.\n\n443\n00:25:36.116 --> 00:25:40.110\nMost of the time if you get access\nto a regular VM on this through\n\n444\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.930\nthe remote desktop connection, and even\nthough it looks functional, it doesn't\n\n445\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.980\nlook like it's really something that you\nwould sit down and want to use every day.\n\n446\n00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.649\nSo it looks a little bit clunky.\n\n447\n00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:52.641\nIt looks like things\nare not moving as quickly.\n\n448\n00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:56.828\nWell instead, if you're running\nIntel Broadwell, excuse me,\n\n449\n00:25:56.828 --> 00:26:01.620\ntype of processors that have the GPU\nbaked in them, they really have said,\n\n450\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.295\nlook, we went ahead and\nintegrated this in for Windows.\n\n451\n00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:09.839\nSo that that particular type of Windows\ncan take advantage of GPUs running on\n\n452\n00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:14.101\nthe server, which we normally don't\nend up seeing very often, okay?\n\n453\n00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:15.420\nThat's another one.\n\n454\n00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.782\nAlso, earlier inside of\nXenServer additions,\n\n455\n00:26:18.782 --> 00:26:21.412\nthere was no support for SMB storage.\n\n456\n00:26:21.412 --> 00:26:24.580\nWhen just about every Windows\nnetwork does what, uses SMB storage.\n\n457\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.900\nSo that's why I said they really\nare trying to integrate into the realm\n\n458\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.180\nof Windows here.\n\n459\n00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.741\nSo they can now also give you\nthat ability to say look,\n\n460\n00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:35.917\nI have an existing SMB storage,\ncan I use that?\n\n461\n00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:38.140\nAnd XenServer says yep.\n\n462\n00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.268\nIt used to be where you go,\nyou can't use that,\n\n463\n00:26:40.268 --> 00:26:43.588\nyou have to switch it over to this if you\nwant Xenserver to be able to access it.\n\n464\n00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:46.050\nWell, now they've made that\nactually a part of it.\n\n465\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.906\nAlso, what they call Direct Inspect APIs\nis another one, okay?\n\n466\n00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:55.547\nAnd this is very important when\nit comes down to things like your\n\n467\n00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:57.835\nanti-virus programs, too.\n\n468\n00:26:57.835 --> 00:26:59.712\nIt means something like this,\n\n469\n00:26:59.712 --> 00:27:03.041\nwhich is something that we\ndon't like to think about.\n\n470\n00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:06.767\nWhen you run VMs, if they're gonna\nbe exposed out to networks and\n\n471\n00:27:06.767 --> 00:27:11.171\nout to the Internet, you normally have\nto ensure that you install some type of\n\n472\n00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.840\nanti-virus program\ninside of your VMs here.\n\n473\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:19.400\nWell, inside of XenServer, especially\nbecause this is an enterprise support,\n\n474\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.170\nwhich means you're gonna pay for this.\n\n475\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.904\nThey're saying look,\nyou can run your anti-malware,\n\n476\n00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:28.810\nyour anti-virus stuff,\nright there on the host instead.\n\n477\n00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.475\nAnd you don't have to now take\nup some resources inside of your\n\n478\n00:27:32.475 --> 00:27:35.027\nVM to worry about even inspecting inside.\n\n479\n00:27:35.027 --> 00:27:39.527\nBecause it can allow the anti-virus to\nreach inside of those VMs through a direct\n\n480\n00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:40.264\nAPI access.\n\n481\n00:27:40.264 --> 00:27:42.597\nSo those are also good, too.\n\n482\n00:27:42.597 --> 00:27:45.285\nLastly, we wanna talk about\njust some basic types\n\n483\n00:27:45.285 --> 00:27:48.487\nof things that we don't normally\nthink about here, okay?\n\n484\n00:27:48.487 --> 00:27:52.212\nAnd this is due to the limitations\nof whatever your hardware is.\n\n485\n00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:55.143\nOne of the big limitations\ninside of VMs is fairly simple.\n\n486\n00:27:55.143 --> 00:28:01.060\nHow much RAM can that VM access, and\nhow big of a hard drive can it access,\n\n487\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.953\nand how many virtual CPUs\ncan it access as well.\n\n488\n00:28:04.953 --> 00:28:12.284\nToday, with 7.0,\nevery single host of XenServer, right?\n\n489\n00:28:12.284 --> 00:28:15.092\nSo the ones that we install XenServer on,\n\n490\n00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:18.472\nit can support up to five\nterabytes of RAM, okay?\n\n491\n00:28:18.472 --> 00:28:20.016\nNow that's insane.\n\n492\n00:28:20.016 --> 00:28:20.596\n&gt;&gt; A lot of RAM.\n\n493\n00:28:20.596 --> 00:28:22.773\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of RAM,\nfive terabytes of RAM.\n\n494\n00:28:22.773 --> 00:28:27.094\nSo if you have enough in your budget\nto buy five terabytes of RAM-\n\n495\n00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:29.690\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen five terabytes of RAM.\n\n496\n00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.100\nHow large would the slots,\n\n497\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.210\nI've never seen a motherboard that would\nsupport that I mean, is what I'm saying.\n\n498\n00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n499\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.466\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty high density there.\n\n500\n00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:38.228\n&gt;&gt; Theoretically, yep.\n\n501\n00:28:38.228 --> 00:28:39.589\n&gt;&gt; But five terabytes of RAM.\n\n502\n00:28:39.589 --> 00:28:41.645\nSo they said, look, we can do that.\n\n503\n00:28:41.645 --> 00:28:43.630\nNow, just when you think\nthat that's enough.\n\n504\n00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.861\nIt also used to be where,\ninside of VMs, you could only do,\n\n505\n00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:54.498\nlet's say up to a maximum of, I'll just\nsay 32 gigs of RAM, okay, for a single VM.\n\n506\n00:28:54.498 --> 00:28:59.628\nWell now in a single VM,\nyou can actually do up to 1.5 terabytes,\n\n507\n00:28:59.628 --> 00:29:02.149\nwhich you can give to a single VM.\n\n508\n00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:07.173\nSo if you imagine that, a single VM\nbeing able to have 1.5 terrabytes\n\n509\n00:29:07.173 --> 00:29:11.878\nof RAM storage available to them,\nor memory, is also kind of key.\n\n510\n00:29:11.878 --> 00:29:16.745\nEvery single host, XenServer will\nactually give you the ability to also be\n\n511\n00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:19.151\nable to recognize up to 288 CPUs.\n\n512\n00:29:19.151 --> 00:29:22.312\nI don't know why that number,\nbut 288 of them.\n\n513\n00:29:22.312 --> 00:29:27.644\nEvery single VM can instead if we need to,\nif we need multi-processors,\n\n514\n00:29:27.644 --> 00:29:32.546\nvirtual processors, instead of 4 or\nwhatever the limitation is,\n\n515\n00:29:32.546 --> 00:29:36.767\nit can actually have up to 32\nvirtual CPUs that it needs.\n\n516\n00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:38.131\n&gt;&gt; And that's per virtual machine.\n\n517\n00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:38.690\n&gt;&gt; Per machine.\n\n518\n00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.930\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, yep.\n\n519\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.530\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot, so\nthey're kind of telling you that,\n\n520\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:47.660\nhey, we're really designed for a large\nenterprise environment if we want to.\n\n521\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.070\nAlso, because of the way that\nthey can do networking as well,\n\n522\n00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.040\nthey can even provide\nhigher speed networking.\n\n523\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.980\nThey've tried to integrate everything in.\n\n524\n00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.868\nThey really want to become kind of\nthe virtualization platform for Windows.\n\n525\n00:29:58.868 --> 00:29:59.734\nWhich is strange,\n\n526\n00:29:59.734 --> 00:30:02.934\nsince their virtualization platform\nis normally gonna be Hyper-V.\n\n527\n00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:05.468\nBut they're trying to get into\nthat particular market here.\n\n528\n00:30:05.468 --> 00:30:09.417\nAnd what they're doing is that they're\nsaying, look, we can offer more for\n\n529\n00:30:09.417 --> 00:30:10.586\nevery VM that you run.\n\n530\n00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:14.525\nBecause as long as you're willing to\nspend the money, you don't have to\n\n531\n00:30:14.525 --> 00:30:18.928\nupgrade in terms of XenServer and then\nhave to kind of do another licensing here.\n\n532\n00:30:18.928 --> 00:30:21.589\nIt just says,\nhere's what it is by default.\n\n533\n00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:26.056\nSo there's a lot for us to think about\nif we're gonna choose a virtualization\n\n534\n00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:30.056\ntechnology, Citrix XenServer may\nbe one that you wanna configure.\n\n535\n00:30:30.056 --> 00:30:33.486\nSo go to their website and take a look\nat a little bit more of the details and\n\n536\n00:30:33.486 --> 00:30:35.640\nwhat it is that they really want to do.\n\n537\n00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.070\nThey want you to be a customer of theirs.\n\n538\n00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.574\nAnd that's why they're\noffering all these features.\n\n539\n00:30:39.574 --> 00:30:41.775\nWe've got a lot more to\ngo in our shows ahead.\n\n540\n00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:44.331\nBut we don't want you to\nactually miss out on that either.\n\n541\n00:30:44.331 --> 00:30:46.340\nBut I think I've ran out of time.\n\n542\n00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.200\n&gt;&gt; It's all right, Ronnie.\n\n543\n00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.760\nThank you for the introduction.\n\n544\n00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.130\nAt least I have some information,\nI know where to start.\n\n545\n00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.192\nI can do my research,\nlike you just mentioned.\n\n546\n00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:54.994\nWho knows, I might become a fan.\n\n547\n00:30:54.994 --> 00:30:59.707\nI'm kind of leaning towards Hyper-V, but\nI'm going to give XenServer a chance.\n\n548\n00:30:59.707 --> 00:31:03.144\nAnd I'm really excited to see what\nyou have to show us here within this\n\n549\n00:31:03.144 --> 00:31:04.250\nupcoming show.\n\n550\n00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.980\nSo thank you so much for joining us today,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n551\n00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.810\ntuning in.\n\n552\n00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.900\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more XenServer headed your way.\n\n553\n00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.310\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n554\n00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.351\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n556\n00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:23.434\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:31:23.434 --> 00:31:26.284\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.486\nWelcome to ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:06.869\nI'm your host Don Pezet [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:08.477\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:12.558\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n6\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.900\nIn this episode, we'll now take a look\nat how to install the XenServer.\n\n8\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.880\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were talking about it,\n\n9\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.950\njust really introducing\nyou to these topics.\n\n10\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.800\nBut with us today to help us get\nthrough this process, we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.020\nRonnie Wong in studio.\n\n12\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.340\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back here in the studio,\n\n14\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.930\nas we really get started in working\ndirectly with Citrix XenServer.\n\n15\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.196\nEven though we do need to understand\nsome of the different concepts and\n\n16\n00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:46.915\nthe background of why we might choose\nthis, and of course about virtualization.\n\n17\n00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:49.323\nThe idea is, of course,\nto just get you started and\n\n18\n00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:52.528\nmaking sure that you understand\nhow to work with Citrix XenServer.\n\n19\n00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:57.106\nOne of the hardest things that I remember\nwhen I first started with virtualization\n\n20\n00:00:57.106 --> 00:01:01.481\ntechnology, especially with the idea\nof what we call this Type I hypervisor,\n\n21\n00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:04.464\nis I started when there was\nactually no such thing as,\n\n22\n00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.670\nwhere ESX really did come\nout with a free version.\n\n23\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.843\nBut once they came out with ESXI,\nso the very first version of it,\n\n24\n00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:12.515\nI installed it onto a machine, and\n\n25\n00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.420\nI was kinda very surprised that it\nreally didn't do anything for me.\n\n26\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.440\nAnd so, we need to make sure that you\nunderstand what it is that we're actually\n\n27\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.950\ninstalling and\nthen how we connect to it to manage it.\n\n28\n00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.135\nSo we're gonna take a look at both of\nthose processes as we get started.\n\n29\n00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:32.354\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in to\nthis particular part of the installation,\n\n30\n00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:35.850\nwhich is,\nwhat do we need to get started here, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.640\nOne, you need to make sure that you do\n\n32\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.154\nget access to a machine that\ncan support Citrix XenServer.\n\n33\n00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.893\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n34\n00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:48.824\nWell, go to their website, take a look\nat the minimum hardware requirements,\n\n35\n00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:50.241\nand make sure you meet that.\n\n36\n00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:54.396\nIf your server is probably within the\nlast, let's say, five or six years now,\n\n37\n00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:58.880\nyou'll probably be able to install\nCitrix XenServer on it and it will run.\n\n38\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.166\nNow, when I say that, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you should go back\n\n39\n00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:07.808\nand try and find the oldest server that\nyou possibly can to run Citrix XenServer.\n\n40\n00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:11.220\nBecause, even if it's the oldest one,\nwill it run it?\n\n41\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.880\nYes.\nCan you still install it?\n\n42\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.710\nYes.\n\n43\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.550\nWill it work?\n\n44\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.192\nYes.\nBut if you're looking for performance,\n\n45\n00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.448\nespecially in a production environment,\n\n46\n00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:23.780\nit is not your best bet to go with\nthe oldest possible hardware you can find.\n\n47\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.900\nYour best bet, of course,\n\n48\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.680\nis to go with newer hardware instead that\nthen allows you to be able to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.650\nSo that's what we normally recommend\nis that you try and find something.\n\n50\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.141\nProbably the last two to three\nyears is probably gonna be fine.\n\n51\n00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:40.100\nAnd you'll probably still get\ngood performance out of it.\n\n52\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.803\nEven though you don't have to, I always\nrecommend that you want to get a XenServer\n\n53\n00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:48.565\nor a hardware, probably you want\nat least two network adapters.\n\n54\n00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.180\nNow, can you run it on one\nif that's all you have?\n\n55\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.800\nYes, okay, perfectly fine.\n\n56\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.121\nBut with two, you can do also something\nthat we call NIC bonding later on, which\n\n57\n00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:01.379\nallows you to treat both of those NICs\nas one, essentially being able to double\n\n58\n00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.530\nthe bandwidth in terms of your network\nconnection going to your XenServer.\n\n59\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.517\nBut if you only have one,\nyou only have one, and\n\n60\n00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:09.224\nthat's what you'll have to deal with.\n\n61\n00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:10.940\nSo, once we have that in place, and\n\n62\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.918\nwe know that we can get a good\nnetwork connection, of course,\n\n63\n00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:17.540\nthere are some planning things\nthat you have to also consider.\n\n64\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.580\nIs to make sure that you choose an IP\nrange that you know that's inside of\n\n65\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.050\nyour network that you want to be able\nto run, as well as think about it,\n\n66\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.230\nfor future sake, in terms of scalability.\n\n67\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.960\nThe ability for you to take multiple\nXenServers and cluster them together\n\n68\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.410\nis also a factor that you may\nwant to consider in the future.\n\n69\n00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.540\nAnd it doesn't matter what IP\naddress you normally give them.\n\n70\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.501\nBut for the sake of managing and\nlogical idea, you might wanna see if\n\n71\n00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:49.480\nyou can find a chunk of two or three or\nmaybe ten IP addresses in a row.\n\n72\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.640\nThat way you can kind of logically make\nsure that you keep them gathered together.\n\n73\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.050\nAt least in your head, if nobody else.\n\n74\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.996\nBut once you have that, that means\nthat your hardware is prepared and\n\n75\n00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.229\nyou're ready to go.\n\n76\n00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.133\nYou do want to remember that as\nyou install Citrix XenServer,\n\n77\n00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.920\nit's gonna wipe clean\nwhatever is on that machine.\n\n78\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.820\nSo, if that's your last copy and\nbackup of something that you, you go,\n\n79\n00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.330\nman, if I lose this information, I'm done.\n\n80\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.410\nYeah, let me go ahead and\ninstall XenServer on it, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.680\nwe shouldn't worry about it.\n\n82\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.954\nWell, that copy's gonna be gone.\n\n83\n00:04:20.954 --> 00:04:24.700\nSo make sure you make a good backup of\nwhatever you had installed on that machine\n\n84\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.470\nbefore you put it on there.\n\n85\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.853\nOr if you're willing to lose it,\nthen it's perfectly fine, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:32.850\nSo, when we start then after that,\nwhat do we need?\n\n87\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.030\nWell, now we need to talk\nabout installation medium.\n\n88\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300\nAnd this is what we want\nto make sure that we do.\n\n89\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.731\nLet's take a look at my\ncomputer screen right now.\n\n90\n00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.770\nAnd this will kind of help us out and\nshow you where you can go.\n\n91\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.520\nIf you don't have Citrix XenServer,\nyou can always go to Citrix and\n\n92\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.710\nbe able to go to their download center.\n\n93\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.370\nNow, here's where it's going\nto be a little bit key.\n\n94\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.630\nYou do need to make sure that you log in.\n\n95\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.842\nAnd it doesn't mean that it's gonna\nrequire you to pay anything, but\n\n96\n00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:02.117\nyou need to at least register, and\nthey'll create an account for you.\n\n97\n00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:04.165\nAnd once you get that account created,\n\n98\n00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:08.500\nthen it will bring you to a screen\nthat's fairly similar to this.\n\n99\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.573\nFrom there you can look for\na link that says Downloads.\n\n100\n00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:18.298\nAnd once I select Downloads,\nat that point I can select a product.\n\n101\n00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:20.453\nI'm gonna scroll down towards the bottom.\n\n102\n00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.492\nAnd notice there's a bunch of these\nthat begin with Xen right here towards\n\n103\n00:05:23.492 --> 00:05:24.460\nthe bottom.\n\n104\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.090\nAnd there's a lot of this that's going on,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.570\nXenApp of course gives you that idea\nof a virtual desktop environment,\n\n106\n00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.660\nwhere it really works almost like remote\ndesktop environments that we have.\n\n107\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.380\nXenDesktop allows you to run\nXenServer on your desktop.\n\n108\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.641\nMobile, client version.\n\n109\n00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:42.182\nYou name it, there's actually right there.\n\n110\n00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:45.490\nThe one we're gonna choose\nis gonna be XenServer.\n\n111\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.102\nOnce I select XenServer,\n\n112\n00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:51.948\nit will now lead me to the different\neditions of XenServer that's available.\n\n113\n00:05:51.948 --> 00:05:55.100\nAnd you can see where there's\nactually earlier editions here.\n\n114\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.230\nI believe in our previous show where we\ndid XenServer, it was either 6.0 or 6.2.\n\n115\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.430\nI don't remember exactly which one it was.\n\n116\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.019\nBut it's right here on XenServer 7.0\n&gt;&gt; That's what we'll be looking at today.\n\n117\n00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:07.402\n&gt;&gt; And that's the one we're\ngoing to be looking at.\n\n118\n00:06:07.402 --> 00:06:12.139\nAnd you can see right here that this one,\nits release date was really, like I said,\n\n119\n00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.560\nback in May of 2016,\n\n120\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.056\nwhich is the May previous to the recording\nof this show in early 2017 here.\n\n121\n00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:24.014\nSo we wanna make sure that we updated and\nthat we were able to do what we needed to.\n\n122\n00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:28.050\nNotice that there's also two\ndifferent editions here too, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.740\nThis Enterprise Edition right here,\n\n124\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.130\nthis is what says requires\nadditional permissions to access.\n\n125\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.155\nThat's what they mean by pay.\n\n126\n00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:36.547\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So at that point,\n\n127\n00:06:36.547 --> 00:06:39.630\nyou're gonna be paying something for\na subscription.\n\n128\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.679\nAnd it's not what you think, you're not\npaying for the software, you're paying for\n\n129\n00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:43.739\nthe support in the software.\n\n130\n00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:46.581\nAnd then unlocking some of those key\nfeatures that are also available\n\n131\n00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.710\nthere, too.\n\n132\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.510\nAnd of course, the Standard Edition\nallows you to get access to the majority\n\n133\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.680\nof everything that you need to run\na XenServer hypervisor on your computer.\n\n134\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.030\nOnce you select that, you will then\ndownload that onto your machine, and\n\n135\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.250\nyou'll just about be ready to go.\n\n136\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.460\nNow, one of the other things that\nyou also want to make sure of,\n\n137\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.460\nis that on XenServer itself, you probably\nwill find that after you connect in,\n\n138\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.520\nit will give you a link to go\nto what we call XenCenter.\n\n139\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.227\nI didn't know if I actually had\nthe ability to download it separately or\n\n140\n00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.409\nnot here, okay.\n\n141\n00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.721\nSo, right here, it doesn't look like it,\noverall, XenCenter, okay.\n\n142\n00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.180\nSo, they do have a separate download here.\n\n143\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.700\nXenCenter is what allows us to\nmanage the XenServers, okay, and\n\n144\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.140\nto manage of course virtual machines that\nwe create on the XenServers as well.\n\n145\n00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.929\nSo, normally, when you first install it,\nand we'll show you what we talked about,\n\n146\n00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:48.405\nyou can go to a web page that's\ngonna be now on your XenServer.\n\n147\n00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:52.941\nAnd it will give you a download\nlink to go and download, of course,\n\n148\n00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.048\nthe Citrix XenCenter itself.\n\n149\n00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:55.617\nIt will give you that.\n\n150\n00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:59.466\nOr you can come here inside Citrix\nitself and notice There it is,\n\n151\n00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:05.440\n7.0.1 Windows Management Console, and you\ncan download this one if you choose to.\n\n152\n00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo it's all up to you which one you\nchoose, to actually be able to do.\n\n153\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.520\nBut those are at least the bare\nminimum of what you need.\n\n154\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.870\nAnd there is one more requirement\nthat I completely forgot about,\n\n155\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.130\nthat I need to make sure\nthat I mention here, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.320\nThat is, for you to manage\nthis Citrix XenCenter itself,\n\n157\n00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.460\nit only comes in the form of an .exe,\nokay, if I remember right.\n\n158\n00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.223\nLet me verify that as I click\non this link here to see.\n\n159\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.692\nIf I do that and I jump down to\nthe Downloads down here, I believe, yep.\n\n160\n00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:44.486\nAnd this is what I wanted to point out,\nnotice it's 57 megs, that's not gigantic.\n\n161\n00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:45.344\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:08:45.344 --> 00:08:48.255\n&gt;&gt; But do you notice something\nthat's missing from here?\n\n163\n00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:49.332\n&gt;&gt; An ISO image?\n\n164\n00:08:49.332 --> 00:08:53.620\n&gt;&gt; An ISO, but\nactually like Mac or Linux, right?\n\n165\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.010\nSo it means that if I'm\ngonna run XenCenter,\n\n166\n00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.710\nI have to do it from a Windows machine.\n\n167\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.654\nYeah, so it doesn't even give you that\noption to go, I can run it on a Mac, or\n\n168\n00:09:02.654 --> 00:09:03.641\nI can run it on Linux.\n\n169\n00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:05.581\nIf you're gonna run XenCenter,\n\n170\n00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.985\nit's gonna be right here on\nthe Windows computer itself.\n\n171\n00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n172\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.175\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou might not consider that a limitation.\n\n173\n00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:15.127\nSome people do, like myself.\n\n174\n00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:16.565\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I consider that a limitation.\n\n175\n00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:19.651\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm so trained, I'm like in\nMicrosoft land that I'm just like, yeah,\n\n176\n00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.062\nWindows, you're good to go right?\n\n177\n00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:21.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big deal [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, big deal, who cares?\n\n179\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.020\nWell, some of us aren't, and so.\n\n180\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.790\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n181\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.820\n&gt;&gt; But yes,\nyou might want to consider that.\n\n182\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.928\nSo how do I run it?\nI run a virtual machine is how I\n\n183\n00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:32.620\nend up running this.\n\n184\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.640\nSo you do want to make sure that\nyou have that available, and\n\n185\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.630\nthat you're gonna download that and\nyou're gonna install it.\n\n186\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.628\nAnd it just runs like a regular EXE does,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n187\n00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.340\nAnd it installed fine and\n\n188\n00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.540\nyou'll be able to get into the management\nconsole itself, be ready to go.\n\n189\n00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.530\nSo make sure you have an installation.\n\n190\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.330\nAnd you can download the ISO like what\nwe showed you earlier for the XenServer.\n\n191\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.700\nAnd then of course you wanna make\nsure you have a copy of this,\n\n192\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.450\nthen you can run that on\nyour machine as well.\n\n193\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.130\nNow, once you have that ISO file down,\n\n194\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.870\nwell, what do you have to do to get it\nready to go onto a physical machine?\n\n195\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.890\nWell, you have two options, right?\n\n196\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.260\nYou can burn it to an actual\noptical media, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.180\nSo that's what I did,\nI had this little blank disk here.\n\n198\n00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.630\nAnd I don't want you to zoom in\ntoo much here, but I wrote on it.\n\n199\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.850\nYeah, thank you, you can see my\nterrible handwriting at this point.\n\n200\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I just made sure that I marked it\n\n201\n00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:27.030\nand ready to go.\n\n202\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.360\nAnd you burn it directly to that CD,\nthat ISO, and you're off and ready to go.\n\n203\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.350\nBut if you're like most of us today,\n\n204\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.790\nit's like, when was the last\ntime you found an optical disc?\n\n205\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.972\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd that's what I'm thinking.\n\n206\n00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:39.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you're looking at that, and\n\n207\n00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:42.830\nI'm thinking, hm, I wonder if\nwe have the ability to actually.\n\n208\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.945\nWhy they didn't have\nsomething like a VHD or\n\n209\n00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:49.250\nVHDX on their site if they're kind of\nleaning towards Microsoft anyways?\n\n210\n00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\nThat's because they\n\n211\n00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:52.527\ndidn't want to run this inside\nof Hyper-V is probably why.\n\n212\n00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:53.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n213\n00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:55.311\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:56.797\n&gt;&gt; Nesting and nesting, but.\n\n215\n00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:01.500\n&gt;&gt; But overall, though, it is,\nit's just an install disk, okay?\n\n216\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.320\nYou can also take the ISO and\ndownload it, mount it instead,\n\n217\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.380\nand then make a bootable USB drive and\ncopy all the files over to it.\n\n218\n00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.530\nAnd that's what I did instead.\n\n219\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.070\nWhy?\n\n220\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.766\nBecause booting up to a USB is much faster\nthan booting up to, well, one of these.\n\n221\n00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.766\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong, I've burned and\n\n223\n00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:22.198\nI've booted a lot of these\nthings in my lifetime.\n\n224\n00:11:22.198 --> 00:11:24.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, not only that, but\nRonnie, show them the back side.\n\n225\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.650\nLook at the scratches there.\n\n226\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.460\nYou were yelling at me before the show,\nso.\n\n227\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little scratched up there.\n\n228\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.208\nI blame Cherokee all over, as she handed\nit to me, as she slid it across the desk.\n\n229\n00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:34.870\nI'm joking.\n\n230\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.440\nBut just kinda realize, yes.\n\n231\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.840\nAnd I actually did use this disk earlier,\nbut I was like, I know that once I\n\n232\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.370\nburn this and I leave it somewhere here in\nthe studio, it's gonna get scratched up.\n\n233\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:50.460\nSo I made a USB key very quickly so\nI could boot directly up to that, okay.\n\n234\n00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.843\nSo now that we have that option, and\nit's going to be much more durable for\n\n235\n00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:54.671\nyou with the USB.\n\n236\n00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.390\nAnd that's kinda the key.\n\n237\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:04.480\nYou want to make it, of course, to,\nyou can put it on a USB 3.0 drive and\n\n238\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.990\nmake sure if your machine has it, a USB\n3.0 port, make it boot much faster, okay.\n\n239\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.047\n2.0 speeds work just fine.\n\n240\n00:12:13.047 --> 00:12:13.789\n&gt;&gt; That's what you get.\n\n241\n00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:15.941\n&gt;&gt; No big deal, and\nthat's what you've got.\n\n242\n00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.157\nAnd if you really have to,\nburn it directly to optical media.\n\n243\n00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.974\nIt normally doesn't require a DVD,\nthis is a DVD.\n\n244\n00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:25.860\nI feel like I wasted it,\ncuz, like you saw,\n\n245\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.072\nit's really not that big,\nI think it's only about 170 megs I\n\n246\n00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:33.426\nthink altogether is what\nthis thing was on the ISO.\n\n247\n00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:34.760\nMaybe a little bit bigger.\n\n248\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.270\n&gt;&gt; It'll be okay.\n\n249\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:35.859\n&gt;&gt; Maybe 1.7 gigs.\n\n250\n00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:39.930\nI can't remember what the exact size,\nokay?\n\n251\n00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:45.510\nAs always, do not just download\nwithout verifying, okay?\n\n252\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.840\nLet's go back to my screen just for\na moment.\n\n253\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.214\nRemember to always match your checksums.\n\n254\n00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:52.493\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\ndo they have a hash algorithm up there?\n\n255\n00:12:52.493 --> 00:12:53.073\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n256\n00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:53.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n\n257\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.470\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you always do that.\n\n258\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.576\nNow, in a testing environment\nlike what we're doing, I'm not so\n\n259\n00:12:58.576 --> 00:12:59.803\nworried about it, okay?\n\n260\n00:12:59.803 --> 00:13:04.670\nOne, I already have installed this a\ncouple of times, so I know that it works.\n\n261\n00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.030\nBut there are times where you do make\na download and it's not complete.\n\n262\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.210\nMake sure you run a hashing\nalgorithm against that.\n\n263\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.400\nCheck it out before this,\n\n264\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.210\nespecially if you're going to be\nputting into a production environment.\n\n265\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.403\nNot only do they do that here, you'll\nalso see during the installation process,\n\n266\n00:13:20.403 --> 00:13:23.564\nit'll give you another chance\nto verify the integrity of your\n\n267\n00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:25.235\nfiles even during the install.\n\n268\n00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:26.590\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty nice.\n\n269\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Take advantage of it when\nyou have the ability to do so.\n\n270\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.540\nAll right, so from that standpoint here,\n\n271\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.540\nwe are pretty much ready to go in\nterms of the installation part.\n\n272\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.142\nSo the only other thing that you would\nhave to be able to do at this point of\n\n273\n00:13:42.142 --> 00:13:46.298\ncourse then is put the USB key or\nyour optical media in the drive.\n\n274\n00:13:46.298 --> 00:13:47.860\n&gt;&gt; Change the boot order.\n\n275\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.600\n&gt;&gt; Reboot the machine.\n\n276\n00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.280\nYep, make sure you change the boot over if\nyou're actually gonna do the USB boot up.\n\n277\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.606\nBut once that's done, then that's what\nwe'll actually be leading to next here.\n\n278\n00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:02.378\nSo Cherokee, let me go ahead and\nget you to turn on our machine.\n\n279\n00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:03.740\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n280\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.720\n&gt;&gt; And then as Cherokee does that,\nwe'll switch over to our screen here.\n\n281\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.250\nAnd you'll actually see the boot\nprocess is what you'll see.\n\n282\n00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.910\nAnd I have to pick up this keyboard so\nthat we can check this out, okay.\n\n283\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.240\nSo I'm running this on just\na regular desktop machine,\n\n284\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.360\na little bit of an older machine here.\n\n285\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.640\nBecause it's pretty much one of\nthe ones that we could find right now.\n\n286\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.140\nIt's weird,\n\n287\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.609\nwe come into this environment where we\ndon't see a lot of this anymore, okay.\n\n288\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.652\nHere it is.\nTo install, whatever you wanna do,\n\n289\n00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:31.995\nit says press Enter.\n\n290\n00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:34.569\nAnd notice that it's starting\nto load up right away.\n\n291\n00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:36.558\nIt gives me two options,\nstandard or advanced.\n\n292\n00:14:36.558 --> 00:14:40.400\nI normally just do the standard and\nlet it do what it needs to do.\n\n293\n00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.100\nNow it's gonna go through and\nstart loading it up, okay?\n\n294\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.890\nNow, this particular procedure,\nas it loads up,\n\n295\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.300\nis just like anything else that you\ninstall, like an operating system.\n\n296\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.740\nIt's going to go ahead and check and\nverify that everything is there.\n\n297\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.298\nBut in just a few moments here, we have\nto walk through an interactive menu.\n\n298\n00:14:57.298 --> 00:14:59.742\nAnd I saw something that said it failed,\nI'm not so worried about it for\n\n299\n00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:00.412\nright now, okay.\n\n300\n00:15:00.412 --> 00:15:03.789\nAll right, so normally, this is the part\nwhere we have to make sure that we\n\n301\n00:15:03.789 --> 00:15:06.820\nunderstand the interaction\nthat goes on here, right.\n\n302\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.330\nFirst and foremost, it says, hey, on your\nkeyboard, which one is it going to be?\n\n303\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.990\nAnd it's right here, I'm gonna choose the\nUS with the QWERTY keyboard and click OK.\n\n304\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.603\nAnd once I do that, it's gonna ask me and\nsay, hey, what do you want to do?\n\n305\n00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:24.310\nDo you want to set this thing up or\ndo you want to just reboot the computer?\n\n306\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.880\nBecause we're saying, are you sure,\ndid you check everything?\n\n307\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.900\nDid you make sure,\nis there some data on this machine?\n\n308\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.901\nIt's giving you a chance right now.\n\n309\n00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:35.218\nIf you're like me, you just pulled one\nof these things that you could find.\n\n310\n00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Point of no return.\n\n311\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.560\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it is the point of no return,\n\n312\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.340\nthat's what it's telling\nyou is something else.\n\n313\n00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.582\nBut I'm fine here, I'm gonna click OK.\n\n314\n00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:45.344\nAnd once we begin doing that,\nof course, you're gonna be checking for\n\n315\n00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.920\nwhatever else it might find.\n\n316\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.749\nIt's looking for\npossibly the idea of an existing version,\n\n317\n00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:53.310\nlike Citrix XenServer 6 or something.\n\n318\n00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.460\nWhether it needs to do an upgrade,\nor is it gonna do a full install.\n\n319\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.541\nAnd of course,\nthere's an end user licensing agreement.\n\n320\n00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.828\nAnd I'm sure if you're good,\nlike Cherokee,\n\n321\n00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:04.773\nwhere you read through every single word\nof these end user licensing agreements,\n\n322\n00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:08.620\nyou would, of course, probably never\nclick on that if you actually did that.\n\n323\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.730\nI'm joking, but you have this ability.\n\n324\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.640\nNow notice here it says,\nhey what would you like to do?\n\n325\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.800\nWould you like to upgrade or\nwould you like to perform a clean install?\n\n326\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.920\nNormally, if there's nothing else on the\nmachine, you probably will not have this\n\n327\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.850\nparticular, previous install and\nit had a different version.\n\n328\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.100\nI would probably choose to do this\nupgrade or I could just wipe it clean and\n\n329\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.200\nstart all over.\n\n330\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.570\nRemember I said that I've actually\ninstalled this a couple of times before\n\n331\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.070\nso, I'm just gonna choose this one to\nperform a clean install because that's\n\n332\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.310\nprobably what we'll normally\ndo at the beginning.\n\n333\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.070\nBut not always.\n\n334\n00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.870\nJust kinda make sure you\nhave your pick there.\n\n335\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.290\nAnd then I'm gonna press Enter, okay?\n\n336\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.130\nNow, you can also Tab if you're\nkind of unsure of whether or\n\n337\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.370\nnot it's actually selecting.\n\n338\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.160\nIt normally highlights the red boxes there\n\n339\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.540\nwith white bars and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n340\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.910\nthe interface is kind of bringing me back,\nRonnie.\n\n341\n00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.710\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n342\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.310\nIt's going to because it's designed for\n\n343\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.060\nthat very basic environment here,\nthat we have.\n\n344\n00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.600\nNow one of the first things\nthat ask you for is,\n\n345\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.390\nhey where are you gonna\nfirst store you VMs?\n\n346\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.620\nSo which disk would you like to use for\nVMs.\n\n347\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.619\nAnd notice that on this particular\nmachine, there's only really one hard\n\n348\n00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:21.201\ndrive, the first one's that's labeled as\nSDA of course is the internal hard drive.\n\n349\n00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:25.359\nThe second one,\nthat is gonna be my USB boot key.\n\n350\n00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:29.567\nSo that's the one that I have Citrix\nZen Server as the installation median.\n\n351\n00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:33.163\nI don't want to install it on that\none cuz that one's too small so\n\n352\n00:17:33.163 --> 00:17:35.572\nI'm going to choose of course SDA, okay?\n\n353\n00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:37.788\nThe other option I'm also going to choose.\n\n354\n00:17:37.788 --> 00:17:41.470\nOops I'm gonna try to choose that and\nI just hit the space bar to do that and\n\n355\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.980\nnow I'm hitting the tab key.\n\n356\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.120\nNotice the little red\nsquare kind of jump down.\n\n357\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.950\nAnd I'm also gonna choose this option.\n\n358\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.040\nIt says enable then provisioning\noptimised storage for zen desktops.\n\n359\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.910\nMost of us don't have to worry about thin\nprovisioning in a production environment\n\n360\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:04.380\nyou probably do not want to enable this,\nI'm not saying you can't but\n\n361\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.470\nthen provisioning essentially says,\nhere it is Cherokee.\n\n362\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.580\nYou're gonna build a Windows server\nmachine, and we're gonna start you off on\n\n363\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.370\na hard drive that can have up\nto a max of let's say 128 gigs.\n\n364\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.770\nPerfectly fine, but at the beginning\nit's not gonna take up 120 gigs.\n\n365\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.030\nLet's say it takes up 30 gigs, right?\n\n366\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.880\nSo what it does instead\nis actually assigning and\n\n367\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.940\ncreating a virtual hard\ndrive of 128 gigs for you.\n\n368\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Like a fixed allocation of space?\n\n369\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it just says,\nlet me shrink that down for right now.\n\n370\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.090\nAnd then as you expand, the ultimate\nsize of it should be about 128 gigs.\n\n371\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.570\nAnd it may even go bigger than that.\n\n372\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.180\nBut sometimes it's usually just about\nthat, but here in our testing environment,\n\n373\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.590\nwe're just gonna leave it to\ndo the thin provisioning.\n\n374\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.220\nBut in a production environment\nit can cause a little bit,\n\n375\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.100\nI don't want to say havoc, but\nperformance issues is here we tend to be.\n\n376\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.740\nSo if you know that you're gonna be\nrunning just pure servers off of this, and\n\n377\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.580\nyou know that it needs to be\nthe highest performance environments.\n\n378\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.210\nYou probably would not choose\nto enable that bin provisioning.\n\n379\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.270\nBut for now,\nI'm just going to select that.\n\n380\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.950\nBecause well we're only gonna run\na couple of virtual machines on here.\n\n381\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.840\nAnd then pick select that, and\nthen move on to the next option.\n\n382\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.920\nNow it's asking for where is the source.\n\n383\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.030\nNotice that there are three\npossible sources here.\n\n384\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.900\nSo even though I chose the idea\nof using an iso or a USB key it\n\n385\n00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.220\ngives you the option to be able\nto do a FTP boot up if you chose.\n\n386\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.530\nSo this means that if you\nhave boot p ready to go or\n\n387\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.380\npxe ready to go on your network adapter\ncards, you can simply boot up to that and\n\n388\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.890\nit can go out and find the FTP server\nthat has your configuration for\n\n389\n00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.440\nyour pixie boot, if you choose to do that.\n\n390\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.230\nOr you can even point it to a network\nfile share that may be existing out there\n\n391\n00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.500\nwith your installation media as well and\nyou can do that.\n\n392\n00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.210\nSo they're pretty much saying the idea\nof doing this yeah is probably not and\n\n393\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.190\nyou might say why not?\n\n394\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.750\nWells its fine when there's one,\ntwo or three computers.\n\n395\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.494\nBut what if you do have a cluster\nof 100 of these n servers going and\n\n396\n00:20:08.494 --> 00:20:13.021\nyou really only don't want to burn 100 of\nthese, and lets say you only burn one,\n\n397\n00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:16.537\nwell that's 100 times that\nyou're going to have to do that.\n\n398\n00:20:16.537 --> 00:20:18.422\n&gt;&gt; Or what if the branch offices\nare in different cities?\n\n399\n00:20:18.422 --> 00:20:23.435\nAnd then you'd have to mail a disk\nto each one of your IT staffers.\n\n400\n00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:26.565\nSo instead you could just point them\nto your source files and say, hey,\n\n401\n00:20:26.565 --> 00:20:29.990\ngo ahead as long as the bandwidth\ncan support that kind of, well,\n\n402\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.990\nlike you said it's not a huge file that\nyou're pulling down so I don't even think.\n\n403\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.130\nMost networks should be able\nto handle that nowadays.\n\n404\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you never know but\nat least you have options right?\n\n405\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.920\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n406\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.120\ntake a look at our next option\nthat's available for us here.\n\n407\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.720\nLet me tab there and then press the space.\n\n408\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.170\nAnd this is where you would choose to do\neither using DHCP or static configuration.\n\n409\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.270\nMy recommendation, of course, is that\nyou choose to do a static configuration.\n\n410\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.790\nCan you use DHCP if you want to?\n\n411\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.693\nYes, but remember,\nthere may be some downfalls,\n\n412\n00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:05.556\nespecially on a server doing this\nthat may change the environment.\n\n413\n00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:12.264\nSo I'm gonna put in the IP address of this\nparticular server that I'm going to use.\n\n414\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.259\nAnd then, we'll connect it on up here,\nand now the name server that I'm going\n\n415\n00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:26.077\nto use as well, and that's gonna be, we're\njust gonna use Google's DNS servers here.\n\n416\n00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:29.832\nClick okay.\n\n417\n00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:31.349\nInvalid subnet mask.\n\n418\n00:21:31.349 --> 00:21:34.141\nWhat did I type in as\nan invalid subnet mask?\n\n419\n00:21:34.141 --> 00:21:35.272\n&gt;&gt; Class B?\n\n420\n00:21:35.272 --> 00:21:37.027\n&gt;&gt; I had one too many periods there.\n\n421\n00:21:37.027 --> 00:21:39.019\nThat's fine, I can use a class B.\n\n422\n00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:41.969\nIt's no big deal, all right.\n\n423\n00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.403\nNow this is where the process begins,\n\n424\n00:21:45.403 --> 00:21:50.242\nand it's saying hey,\nwhere is the repository here?\n\n425\n00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:53.096\nLet me see, did I actually choose or-\n&gt;&gt; Do we select them?\n\n426\n00:21:53.096 --> 00:21:54.820\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's what happened.\n\n427\n00:21:56.622 --> 00:21:58.357\nNetwork access to continue.\n\n428\n00:21:58.357 --> 00:21:59.590\nLet me go back.\n\n429\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.670\nApparently, I kind of clicked through\nsomething that I didn't mean to.\n\n430\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.400\nThat's where it is, local media.\n\n431\n00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.570\nThat's a little bit better.\n\n432\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.320\n&gt;&gt; We're flicking through them to\nshow everyone, you left it there.\n\n433\n00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.482\nThat's what you don't wanna do,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n434\n00:22:11.482 --> 00:22:13.569\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, what did I choose there?\n\n435\n00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:16.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so supplemental packs.\n\n436\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.150\nWe're not gonna install any\nsupplemental packs right now,\n\n437\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.500\nwe're just trying to get everything up and\nrunning.\n\n438\n00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.820\nYou can always install them\na little bit later on.\n\n439\n00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.180\nAnd then, this is where you have\nthat option like I was telling you.\n\n440\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.560\nYou can always confirm it by\ndoing your own hash verification,\n\n441\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.180\nwhich I do recommend, but\nif this is absolutely for\n\n442\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.955\na production environment,\nyou want to do this.\n\n443\n00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna take a long time, but\n\n444\n00:22:38.887 --> 00:22:40.283\nI'd rather you go ahead and\n\n445\n00:22:40.283 --> 00:22:43.439\ndo this now before you install\nthen now start 100 of them and\n\n446\n00:22:43.439 --> 00:22:47.646\nthen realize something's wrong with my\nsource files, I better not do that so.\n\n447\n00:22:47.646 --> 00:22:50.711\nBut for now we're just gonna\nskip the verification and\n\n448\n00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:53.913\nI'm gonna type in my super\nsecret password of password.\n\n449\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.170\nClick OK.\n\n450\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.910\nAnd click Next and\nthere's the static IP addresses.\n\n451\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.960\nSo I apparently, again like I said,\nI picked the wrong one at the beginning.\n\n452\n00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.960\nI have everything in place.\n\n453\n00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.500\nNow it's asking me for a name.\n\n454\n00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.770\nNow, this is very important\nas far as the name goes.\n\n455\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.125\nYou don't have to, you can leave it\nwhatever that default weird name that it\n\n456\n00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:25.681\ngave right,\ndash XYKGV whatever it might have been.\n\n457\n00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:30.313\nBut instead, you wanna make sure\nthat you follow something if you're\n\n458\n00:23:30.313 --> 00:23:33.861\ngonna be putting this all together for\nsomeone else.\n\n459\n00:23:33.861 --> 00:23:35.926\n&gt;&gt; Something logical, right?\n\n460\n00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:40.709\nBecause I've been in environments before,\nwell an environment that I can think of\n\n461\n00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:44.693\nwhere someone decided to name\nsystems after dragons, and that was.\n\n462\n00:23:44.693 --> 00:23:45.863\n&gt;&gt; You can do that, yes.\n\n463\n00:23:45.863 --> 00:23:46.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n464\n00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:47.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why not?\n\n465\n00:23:47.247 --> 00:23:47.946\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\n\n466\n00:23:47.946 --> 00:23:51.085\nI've seen them named after\nStar Wars systems myself.\n\n467\n00:23:51.085 --> 00:23:54.482\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you name it, I've seen those.\n\n468\n00:23:54.482 --> 00:23:55.659\nThose options available.\n\n469\n00:23:55.659 --> 00:23:57.439\nI'm just gonna leave the default one.\n\n470\n00:23:57.439 --> 00:23:58.978\nI'm not going to worry about a second one.\n\n471\n00:23:58.978 --> 00:24:02.930\nOf course, you should make sure that you\nmake a second one there if you need to.\n\n472\n00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.690\nI'm inside of the United States here.\n\n473\n00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:10.320\nSo I'm going to choose America for\nmy time zone here in New York instead.\n\n474\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.960\nNow, the great thing is,\nit tells you exactly,\n\n475\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.270\nlike did I have to scroll down through it?\n\n476\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.400\nIt says, select that city or\narea, managed host, or\n\n477\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.580\njust press a letter to jump\nto that particular location.\n\n478\n00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.560\nThat's how I got to New York so quickly.\n\n479\n00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.929\nIf not, I would have been scrolling for\na good long time.\n\n480\n00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:27.713\nInstead, click OK.\n\n481\n00:24:27.713 --> 00:24:30.120\nNow it says, hey,\nhow should we determine this?\n\n482\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.730\nWell, remember that the idea of\nsynchronization is a very important\n\n483\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.820\npart of your network.\n\n484\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.280\nI'm not gonna worry about\ndoing the manual entry.\n\n485\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.934\nI'm going to pick one of the NTP\npool servers that are out there.\n\n486\n00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:46.323\nThat we have available.\n\n487\n00:24:48.998 --> 00:24:50.810\nFrom this point, click OK.\n\n488\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.860\nAnd now, look.\n\n489\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.870\nHere's where we begin the install process.\n\n490\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.700\nNow, this installation process\ncan take a lot of time.\n\n491\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.490\nIt depends on the performance\nof your machine.\n\n492\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.250\nSo, what you'll notice is,\nhere is, of course, the majority,\n\n493\n00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.130\na good 30 to 40 if not 60% of\nthe time as an IT professional,\n\n494\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.160\nwatching bars move across the screen\nas you've gotten everything set up.\n\n495\n00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.040\nBut we're actually going to go ahead and\nhopefully see this process through.\n\n496\n00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.241\nAnd in the end,\nwe'll actually see it installed and\n\n497\n00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:27.405\nthen we'll take a look at that\nbriefly as well for our episodes too.\n\n498\n00:25:27.405 --> 00:25:29.830\nBut you'll see here,\nit's not even installing yet, right?\n\n499\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.740\nIt's taking its time and preparing,\nmaking sure that all the configuration\n\n500\n00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.540\nstuff that we chose, it's put it\ninto the files that it needs to.\n\n501\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.650\nAnd in just a moment,\n\n502\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.980\nI just want to see if it actually begins\nthe install process and goes through.\n\n503\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.051\nSo it's up to 90%, or\n98%, one of the two, 90.\n\n504\n00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:47.940\nYeah, it's hard to see.\n\n505\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.420\nAnd there it goes, okay.\n\n506\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.760\nSo now here it is.\n\n507\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.080\nIt begins its installation process.\n\n508\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.890\nBecause I'm on an older machine,\nthis is going to take quite a while for\n\n509\n00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.330\nit to actually finish.\n\n510\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.715\nBut what we're gonna do is\nthrough the magic of what we have\n\n511\n00:26:01.715 --> 00:26:05.459\navailable to us is we're gonna\nskip to the very end here, okay?\n\n512\n00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:07.220\nSo we're just gonna take a brief break and\n\n513\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.498\nwe'll be right back towards\nthe end of this process.\n\n514\n00:26:09.498 --> 00:26:13.480\nAnd we'll see it finished\nup here in just a moment.\n\n515\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.770\nAll right, there it is.\n\n516\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.508\nIt is done, and\nthrough the magic of TV here,\n\n517\n00:26:17.508 --> 00:26:21.776\nyou didn't have to sit through the 10 or\n15 minutes, or how long.\n\n518\n00:26:21.776 --> 00:26:24.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't have to\nwatch the whole turkey bake.\n\n519\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n520\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.170\nSo here we go.\n\n521\n00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.120\nSo, here it is.\n\n522\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.720\nThe installation is completed.\n\n523\n00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.348\nNow it's telling us,\nit's giving us directions.\n\n524\n00:26:30.348 --> 00:26:33.813\nSo Cherokee, I'm gonna ask if you'll\ngo ahead and remove that USB key, so\n\n525\n00:26:33.813 --> 00:26:36.619\nit doesn't boot back into\nthe installation process again.\n\n526\n00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:37.210\n&gt;&gt; USB removed.\n\n527\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.404\n&gt;&gt; Yep, USB removed.\n\n528\n00:26:38.404 --> 00:26:39.829\nAnd I click OK.\n\n529\n00:26:39.829 --> 00:26:43.845\nAnd now we're about to see the entire\nmagic hopefully of everything else that\n\n530\n00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:45.400\ngoes on here in just a moment.\n\n531\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.200\nI thought I told it to.\n\n532\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.730\nThere it goes.\n\n533\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.760\nI was gonna say, maybe I have to\nactually press a couple more keys.\n\n534\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.990\nBut now it's beginning its reboot process.\n\n535\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.900\nAnd in a moment, we'll see the end\nresult of what we're gonna see,\n\n536\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.207\nwhich is a full installation of\nCitrix XenServer onto this machine.\n\n537\n00:27:00.207 --> 00:27:01.870\nNow, when we get access into it,\n\n538\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.270\nyou'll actually see here\nit is inside of the GRUB.\n\n539\n00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.900\nIt's giving me different\naspects that I could do.\n\n540\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.940\nUsually I just leave it alone and\nlet it do its default.\n\n541\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.530\nYou notice that there was actually\neven a safe mode in there.\n\n542\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.870\nSo if something does go\nwrong with Citrix XenServer,\n\n543\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:18.090\nthat's what you'll also end up being\nable to go in and fix that as well.\n\n544\n00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:23.318\nNow, Citrix XenServer also has its\nown command line utility called,\n\n545\n00:27:23.318 --> 00:27:25.185\nI think it's called XE.\n\n546\n00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:28.420\nI think sometimes you hear\npeople call it Z, at times here.\n\n547\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.533\nBut it's its own, essentially,\nlittle brand of ability\n\n548\n00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:38.450\nto manage the entire server\nby the command line, okay?\n\n549\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:43.371\nSo here is the last step in our\nparticular installation process.\n\n550\n00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:45.418\nYou wanna make sure at the very end,\n\n551\n00:27:45.418 --> 00:27:50.240\nconfirm that everything is the way that\nyou want it to be when you set it up.\n\n552\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.080\nIt's easy to go, I know a setup,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n553\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.040\nAnd you can kind of leave it at that.\n\n554\n00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.630\nBut I like to always verify\nthrough here on this menu.\n\n555\n00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.780\nNotice at this point, right, for me,\nI can take a look at the display and\n\n556\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.780\nit gives me a lot of\ninformation over on the side.\n\n557\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.080\nI can take a look at the network and\nmanagement interface.\n\n558\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.810\nIf I want to get into it,\nI just simply press Enter and\n\n559\n00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.820\nat this point here it says, hey,\nno network interfaces are plugged in.\n\n560\n00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.540\nAnd that means I'm missing\na network adapter.\n\n561\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.080\nAnd I put an IP address on this and\nI didn't even think about that.\n\n562\n00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.100\nSo, what would I actually have to do?\n\n563\n00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.951\nWell, in a moment here, you'll see that it\nwent ahead and gave a static IP address.\n\n564\n00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:32.255\nAnd I don't actually remember if I did,\nyep, I think I actually did.\n\n565\n00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:33.205\nNo, I didn't.\n\n566\n00:28:33.205 --> 00:28:36.419\nI was trying to see if I plugged\nin a network adapter or not.\n\n567\n00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:38.070\nBut here, when we take a look,\n\n568\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.520\nwe'll plug in a network adapter in our\nshow as we continue on through here.\n\n569\n00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.049\nAnd you will actually see that\nyou have those configurations.\n\n570\n00:28:46.049 --> 00:28:49.630\nYou also have your DNS server,\nnetwork time protocols.\n\n571\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.460\nYou can continue to do that as well, okay.\n\n572\n00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.181\nUltimately, there are a couple\nof things you do want to change.\n\n573\n00:28:55.181 --> 00:28:57.539\nOne, of course,\nis gonna be the authentication.\n\n574\n00:28:57.539 --> 00:29:01.320\nYou don't want anybody just coming here,\nbeing able to plug a monitor in and\n\n575\n00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.920\na keyboard and getting access right here.\n\n576\n00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.740\nSo you wanna make sure that you change\nthis right here as far as the password.\n\n577\n00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.250\nAnd of course the log in and log out.\n\n578\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.060\nAnd notice it says root at the beginning.\n\n579\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.383\nSo this is the password we\nset up during the install.\n\n580\n00:29:16.383 --> 00:29:19.471\nAnd the way that you would get in\nthere if you wanted to change this.\n\n581\n00:29:21.881 --> 00:29:26.110\nAnd this particular password will be\nessential when you go onto the XenServer\n\n582\n00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.525\nand you start adding\nin XenServers as well.\n\n583\n00:29:28.525 --> 00:29:31.425\nIt will require the root login too, okay?\n\n584\n00:29:31.425 --> 00:29:33.425\nI'm not so worried about that for\nright now.\n\n585\n00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:35.385\nBut notice that there's\nvirtual machines here.\n\n586\n00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:39.120\nIt says, hey, to view these virtual\nmachines, who's running on this host?\n\n587\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.572\nWell, nothing, okay, so.\n\n588\n00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:44.100\n&gt;&gt; At this point we've just\ninstalled the software, yep.\n\n589\n00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:49.000\n&gt;&gt; And it can also show you of course\nwhether the performance, you name it.\n\n590\n00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.260\nBut one of the things\nyou won't see on here.\n\n591\n00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.640\nWhich is kind of neat, at least to me.\n\n592\n00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.255\nFirst time it also confused me.\n\n593\n00:29:55.255 --> 00:30:00.880\nWas, it doesn't give you any ability\nto install a VM from here very easily.\n\n594\n00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.000\nUnless you can go into the command\nshell and you can actually run\n\n595\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.910\nall of those Xen commands that\nwe normally talk about, okay.\n\n596\n00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.146\nSo from this point,\n\n597\n00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:14.110\nthe only thing that I'm missing is really\na network connection to plug right in.\n\n598\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.117\nBut when we get into the next episode,\n\n599\n00:30:16.117 --> 00:30:19.571\nwe'll actually make sure that\nwe show that network connection,\n\n600\n00:30:19.571 --> 00:30:24.470\nbecause we're not quite done completely\nyet as far being able to manage anything.\n\n601\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.630\nSo I now need to connect\nthis one to a network.\n\n602\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.364\nAnd then, of course, it means I have\nto go and install XenCenter and\n\n603\n00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:34.535\nget into the management part.\n\n604\n00:30:34.535 --> 00:30:37.299\nAnd at that point,\nwe can start installing VMs.\n\n605\n00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:40.970\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n606\n00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.145\nCuz we showed you the basics\nof the installation.\n\n607\n00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:45.720\nMade sure you know what we\nneeded to walk through.\n\n608\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.110\nAnd that should be plenty for\nus to get started.\n\n609\n00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.540\nAnd the only thing I really left out\nwas that network adapter connection.\n\n610\n00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.024\nAnd we'll pull a network cable over.\n\n611\n00:30:53.024 --> 00:30:56.000\nAnd we'll be able to actually get\nstarted on that not too long from now.\n\n612\n00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nwalking us through those steps, Ronnie.\n\n613\n00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.860\nIt really wasn't a difficult installation.\n\n614\n00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.460\nIt wasn't as pretty as\nwe might have hoped.\n\n615\n00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.290\nBut here's the thing.\n\n616\n00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.946\nIn a production environment,\nthat's really just not as important.\n\n617\n00:31:06.946 --> 00:31:08.550\nWe're talking about performance here.\n\n618\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.335\nAnd as long as the system's willing and\nable to do what we want it to do,\n\n619\n00:31:11.335 --> 00:31:13.000\nthen that's what we care about.\n\n620\n00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.828\nSo thank you so much for joining us today.\n\n621\n00:31:14.828 --> 00:31:17.540\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n622\n00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.440\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n623\n00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n624\n00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.206\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n625\n00:31:23.206 -->

00:00:08.482\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:11.538\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:14.101\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n6\n00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.182\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:20.271\nIf you following along, you know that we\nhave already spoke about virtualization,\n\n8\n00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:24.660\nwe've installed the software and now we're\nleft with installing the virtual machines.\n\n9\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.063\nSo with us today we have Mr. Ronnie Wong\nin studio to help us through this process.\n\n10\n00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:30.262\nThank you for joining us Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.358\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:35.614\nhaving me back as we take a look at more\nof understanding how to use, of course,\n\n13\n00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:39.952\nthe Citrix XenSever, which I'm not\ngonna be able to say very easily, 7.0.\n\n14\n00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:43.750\nNow, remember that we have previous\nadditions of Citrix that's been out there\n\n15\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.629\nand XenServer that's been out there.\n\n16\n00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.439\n7.0 offers a few more advantages\nespecially in the enterprise editions,\n\n17\n00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.621\nbut they made a lot more of\nthe things that are really\n\n18\n00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.850\ngood even better in 7.0 as well.\n\n19\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.410\nAnd that's what really\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n20\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.530\nBut some of the fundamental things,\nof course, is now that we have XenServer\n\n21\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.620\ninstalled on host machines, we need to be\nable to manage them a little bit more.\n\n22\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.230\nWe need to be able to access them, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.880\nthen start creating VMs on\nthose virtual machines.\n\n24\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.060\nAnd that's really kind of one of\nthe fundamental things that we have to\n\n25\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550\nmake sure that we can do.\n\n26\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.780\nIf we can't at least do that,\n\n27\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.180\nwell, then we have virtualization\nthat fails right at the beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360\nSo that is what we're going to be\ntaking a look at in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.420\nWhat we hope to accomplish, of course,\nis that we wanna make sure that you know\n\n30\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.780\nhow to install, of course,\na Windows VM and then a Linux VM as well.\n\n31\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.290\nAnd then talk about some of the different\nthings that you have to watch out for,\n\n32\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.180\nsuch as installing the actual guest\ntools that they have available,\n\n33\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.010\nwhich allow for the VM to be\nmonitored better, and of course,\n\n34\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.820\nto actually have a better interaction\nwith the host machine itself.\n\n35\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.560\nSo that is what we're jumping into.\n\n36\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.370\nOkay, so Cherokee, when we start\ntalking about managing VMs then,\n\n37\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.820\nand start talking managing the hypervisor\nand being able to do a few things.\n\n38\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.180\nIf you've experienced the regular\ndesktop environment before,\n\n39\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.770\nwe know it's fairly easy\ninside of virtual box.\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.720\nEverything is installed right there and\nyou have a nice GUI interface.\n\n41\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.740\nBut inside a XenServer though,\nonce we get it up and running,\n\n42\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.020\nthere's really not a lot of adjustment\nthat we do right there on the host itself.\n\n43\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.270\nSo that means all of our management has\nto come through a separate utility.\n\n44\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.600\nAnd normally, it's gonna be from my\nseparate device on the network as well.\n\n45\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.950\nSo the great thing about this\nis that it means I don't have to\n\n46\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.880\nalways have a direct access\ninto the XenServer itself.\n\n47\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.770\nI don't always have to do\nan SSH into the XenServer.\n\n48\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.440\nWhat I can do is I can install\nthe management software on\n\n49\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.080\nanyone of the consoles that I choose to or\non the machines that I choose in.\n\n50\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.790\nThey do have to be Windows based.\n\n51\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.085\nBut once I install that, then I have to\nget the XenSever to be recognized and\n\n52\n00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.745\nfrom that point, once we get that done,\nwe have to start creating VMs.\n\n53\n00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:57.775\nSo that is what we want to make\nsure that we understand the process\n\n54\n00:02:57.775 --> 00:02:59.225\nright away, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.285\nLet's go ahead and\nstart from the very beginning.\n\n56\n00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.935\nAnd let's take a look at my machine and\nthis will help get us started.\n\n57\n00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:09.395\nSo in our previous episode, we really\ndid show you the basic installation\n\n58\n00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:13.040\nof XenServer 01,\nwhere we just installed it.\n\n59\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.150\nAnd everything kind of came up.\n\n60\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.360\nWe were verifying some of the information\non the one screen that's available,\n\n61\n00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.170\nwhen you do plug a monitor\ninto your Xenserver, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.120\nNow, once you have that up and going,\nthere's not a lot else you're gonna\n\n63\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.190\nneed to do as long as that machine\nis running, you're perfectly fine.\n\n64\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.620\nYou just need to get on another machine\non your network that you also, of course,\n\n65\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.160\nhave access to where those VM hosts are.\n\n66\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.010\nAnd once you do,\nyou just wanna make sure, of course, that\n\n67\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.650\nyou can gain access to, well,\nat least that XenServer, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.830\nSo the good thing is, I can ping it,\nwhich means I have good connectivity.\n\n69\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.230\nFrom that point, there's a couple of\nthings that we have to do, which is,\n\n70\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.570\nof course,\nget access to the XenCenter, itself.\n\n71\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.350\nAnd then we have to begin to go,\nall right,\n\n72\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.184\nhow do I now get access to all those\nimages or [COUGH] ISOs, excuse me,\n\n73\n00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:15.320\nthat I need to install inside of\nmy XenCenter as well, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.170\nSo the easiest way to do this,\nis we can open up our browser and\n\n75\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.850\ninside of the browser environment,\nI can simply go ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.420\ntype in the IP address to\nthat browser environment, and\n\n77\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.440\nyou can see right away,\nit connects me into my XenServer.\n\n78\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.600\nWe actually did use this IP\naddress when we did the install.\n\n79\n00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.640\nSo here, you see where it says,\nwelcome, and\n\n80\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.190\nthis confirms to you that\nXenCenter has been installed.\n\n81\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.410\nWe're reaching out across the network.\n\n82\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.480\nIt also shows that we're ready to make\nthis type of network connection into\n\n83\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.720\nit as well.\n\n84\n00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.450\nThen it have a Read Me file\nthat you can take a look at.\n\n85\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.420\nBut what we're really centering\nin on is pretty much right here,\n\n86\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.990\nwhere it says XenCenter.\n\n87\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.430\nAnd it gives you a couple of links.\n\n88\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.710\nInside of this link right here where\nit says xenCenter, I'm not gonna be\n\n89\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.770\nable to say, xenCenter CD image, you can\ndownload the CD image burn it to a CD,\n\n90\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.440\nand then you can take it to any Windows\nmachine you want to and install it.\n\n91\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.210\nOr, you can simply download\nthe installer itself, and\n\n92\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.060\nthat's another way that\nwe can have that too.\n\n93\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.010\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, you say any system here.\n\n94\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.530\nDo we have any kind of\nsystem requirements?\n\n95\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.350\nDo we need a high performance machine,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n96\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.640\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, not really, right?\n\n97\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.080\nFor this one, I'm running a Windows\n10 machine on its basic install.\n\n98\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.940\nAnd I believe I've given\nthis 2 gigs RAM and\n\n99\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.470\nit really only has like a 60 gig hard\ndrive or something like that, right?\n\n100\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.130\nSo it's not really hefty.\n\n101\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.215\nBut you compare this with something\nlike the VMware's vSphere,\n\n102\n00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:49.710\nwhich requires 8 gigs of RAM\nto be on that machine and\n\n103\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.000\nat least a version of server\nrunning in the background,\n\n104\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.270\nthat's a lot more hefty in its\nrequirements to have installed and run.\n\n105\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.434\nIf I remember right, the first time that\nI ended up using a XenCenter itself,\n\n106\n00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:04.280\nit was before Windows 7.\n\n107\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.820\nSo it might have even been Vista or\neven XP at that point.\n\n108\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.410\nI can't really remember exactly for\nsome reason.\n\n109\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.254\nNeither one of those operating\nsystems are kinda bringing it up but\n\n110\n00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:15.509\nthey did have a lot less\nrequirements at that point.\n\n111\n00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.797\nSo here they haven't really\ncharged up the requirements for\n\n112\n00:06:18.797 --> 00:06:21.470\nrunning something like XenCenter here,\nokay?\n\n113\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.720\nNow if you don't want to install it from\nhere, you can always download the latest\n\n114\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.270\nedition, and\nthis is where you can also go as well.\n\n115\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.300\nSo right here from the server itself,\nto download the most up-to-date version,\n\n116\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.920\nhow to go and download and\ninstall the new version of XenCenter.\n\n117\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.190\nThey do update this product, so you'll see\nwhere like mine is gonna be version 7.0,\n\n118\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.980\nbut you might see where it's now version\n7.02 or 7., whatever it might be.\n\n119\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.350\nSo you will get iterations of this and\nit does update.\n\n120\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.570\nThe great thing is once\nwe install XenCenter,\n\n121\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.088\nwe can choose whether to keep checking for\nupdates or not.\n\n122\n00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:03.540\nOf course, XenCenter would always rather\nyou actually keep up to date, and\n\n123\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.860\ndownload the latest one\nthat you possibly can.\n\n124\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.400\nBecause whatever benefits are there,\n\n125\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.840\nwhatever security features that\nthey found, they said look,\n\n126\n00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.710\nwe need to plug that hole, those will\nalways be good in the updates too.\n\n127\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.510\nBut for right now,\nI just downloaded the installer itself.\n\n128\n00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.560\nAnd from the installer,\nyou can run that installer, and\n\n129\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.410\nit's just like a regular old\ninstaller from everything else\n\n130\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.400\nthat you've actually ever seen, where you\njust run it, and you simply just click,\n\n131\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.860\nnext, and\nyou let it install all the way through.\n\n132\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.710\nI've previously done that so\nthat we didn't have to watch\n\n133\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.570\na lot of this installation, when we\nget into the operating system, we'll\n\n134\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.720\nbe watching a lot of those blue bars going\nacross, or bars going across the screen.\n\n135\n00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.620\nBut overall though,\nI've installed it on this machine, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.300\nNow once we get it installed on\nthe machine, we need to find it.\n\n137\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.620\nSo how do we do that\ninside of Windows 10 here?\n\n138\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.705\nSo here it is on my screen, once again,\nwe'll just simply come down here to\n\n139\n00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:58.942\nthe Cortana search, and I'll just type in-\n&gt;&gt; She's so helpful.\n\n140\n00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:00.022\n&gt;&gt; I know, she is.\n\n141\n00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:02.900\nAnd look at that, there it is,\nCitrix XenCenter.\n\n142\n00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000\nI have also get ahead and created the icon\nright down here on my task bar as well,\n\n143\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.730\nso I can get access to it.\n\n144\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.030\nBut it really serves itself\nup like this right now.\n\n145\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.880\nNow, I've already added\nin another XenServer.\n\n146\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.800\nWhile we were off air, I went ahead and\ncreated a second Zensor.\n\n147\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.130\nYou've already seen me create one so\n\n148\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.720\nit's no big deal, but I added in a second\none right here just so we can see it.\n\n149\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.610\nBut we need to add in another one,\nbut before we do that,\n\n150\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.000\nlet's explore this interface\njust briefly here.\n\n151\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.460\nSo now that ZenCenter's open.\n\n152\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.280\nUsually the first time that you get access\ninto it, it may ask you for a username and\n\n153\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.620\npassword.\n\n154\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.600\nSo especially when you're connecting in,\n\n155\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.560\nlike when you connect into a Zen server\nyou'll see that, it may do that.\n\n156\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.480\nBut it could be that you've\nalso set administrative\n\n157\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.650\naccess on the Zen center itself.\n\n158\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.540\nSo you may also have to\nprovide credentials for\n\n159\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.960\njust getting access to this too.\n\n160\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.250\nSo it just depends on who's running it and\nhow it's actually being run.\n\n161\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.020\nWhen you installed it, you can choose\neither for everybody or just for\n\n162\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.430\nthis one user.\n\n163\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.798\nAnd if you do it only for that one user,\n\n164\n00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:10.608\nyou have to have that user's credentials\nwhen you go and click on the button to\n\n165\n00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:14.905\nlaunch the application before you'd\nactually be able to open it up.\n\n166\n00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:17.075\nAll right, so here it's fairly simple,\n\n167\n00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.440\nlooks just like of\nthe applications that we've seen.\n\n168\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.980\nBut at the beginning it really\nstarts from right here, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.710\nSo it usually doesn't have\nthe XenServer already installed, but\n\n170\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.740\nright here you see it,\nit just looks fairly simple.\n\n171\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.220\nAnd of course right away I\nknow that it has XenServer01\n\n172\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.140\nthat I want to add in here.\n\n173\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:44.090\nSo, it's intuitive, which if you take\na look it says Add New XenCenter.\n\n174\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.770\nNow that used to be all that it did,\neverything else was pretty much blank and\n\n175\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.110\nhad some little diagrams but now they've\ntried to be a little bit more graphic.\n\n176\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.050\nAnd you can see even down here they have\na nice little link, it says add a server.\n\n177\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.550\nThey both go the same place,\nyou can add a server here.\n\n178\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.670\nIf you want to start upgrading\nmaybe to your Enterprise.\n\n179\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.960\nNotice that you can also purchase\nadditional support and they would love for\n\n180\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.830\nyou of course to be able to do that.\n\n181\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.020\nAnd even a link here for\n\n182\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.180\ndesktop virtualization,\nwe are simply gonna select add a server.\n\n183\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.370\nAt this point,\n\n184\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.630\nhere's where we want to make sure that\nwe add in the information that we need.\n\n185\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.350\nNow during the installation of XenServer\nsuff remember we set up a user name and\n\n186\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.145\na password usually of course\nbecause it's based around LINUX.\n\n187\n00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:33.060\nYou're gonna have the regular\nadministrator one which is gonna be route,\n\n188\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.810\nand then all we have to do is type\nin the IP address of the server here\n\n189\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.970\nthat we want to add in.\n\n190\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.160\nAnd once I type in the IP\naddress of the server,\n\n191\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.830\nthat's locking me up there for a moment.\n\n192\n00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.940\nAnd I'm going to do the password,\n\n193\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.915\nyou see like I type in my password.\n\n194\n00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:57.965\nFrom that point I'm going to select add,\nand\n\n195\n00:10:57.965 --> 00:11:03.403\nnow we'll try to connect, and\nwe'll try to synchronize and\n\n196\n00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:08.304\nright away, once we do that,\nyou'll notice over here\n\n197\n00:11:08.304 --> 00:11:13.206\non the left hand side,\nyou'll add in that zen server,\n\n198\n00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:18.770\nzero one, and it will also add\nin different things that says.\n\n199\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.311\nYou may choose to see this or\n\n200\n00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:25.060\nyou may need to see is inside of your\nXEN Server management at this point.\n\n201\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.960\nSo are there any DVD's inside\n\n202\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.240\nof that particular machine right\nnow that you may want to see?\n\n203\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.010\nLocal storage is another one, and\n\n204\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.450\nthen even removal storage if\nthere's any removal storage.\n\n205\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.580\nYou can see over here on the right-hand\nside some details to that,\n\n206\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.760\nsuch as its general properties.\n\n207\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.240\nWhere there's removable storage, and\nsays physical removable storage.\n\n208\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.140\nYou notice that it has something, but\nit doesn't really tell you much there.\n\n209\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.170\nYou can even check on its general status\nat this point, that is connected.\n\n210\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.750\nWe're not doing anything\nmultipathing right now,\n\n211\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.950\nwhich we will talk about\na little bit later on.\n\n212\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.230\nSo here is the addition of XenCenter 01.\n\n213\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:09.470\nNow sometimes you'll also notice this\nicon, you'll see this little green dot.\n\n214\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.420\nThis tells you, this guy is ready for the\nconnection and ready for you to manage and\n\n215\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.400\ndo what you want to do.\n\n216\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.630\nLooks like Xen002 even though I have\nconnected to it before, I get this red\n\n217\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.150\ndot with a little slash through it which\nis kind of that universal symbol for no.\n\n218\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.810\n&gt;&gt; So does that signify an offline state?\n\n219\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, it just signify that even\nthough I had connected one time,\n\n220\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.490\nit's not connected right now.\n\n221\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.330\nSo the great thing is,\n\n222\n00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.090\nit's relatively intuitive on how\nyou fix something like this.\n\n223\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.420\nLet me zoom out, just in case it's\ngonna give me some issues again.\n\n224\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.130\nIf I right-click on\nthat Zensensor row two,\n\n225\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.210\nyou'll see the menu right\nhere that says Connect.\n\n226\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.015\nAnd once i click on it, it will go through\nand stay there and now it will populate\n\n227\n00:12:55.015 --> 00:13:00.310\nand you'll see that Zensensor O2 there is\nalready a couple of different additions,\n\n228\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.790\nwhen you compare to the other ones that\nwe have right here available to us.\n\n229\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.820\nSo the only ones that we really\ngot to worry about right?\n\n230\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.530\nAs the more Xen servers that we add in and\n\n231\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:15.560\nwe can add in up to 16 Xen servers\nif we choose to inside of XenCenter.\n\n232\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.220\nYou can have more than that,\nbut in theory,\n\n233\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.490\nwhen you start doing what we call\nclustering those together to work as\n\n234\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.230\na single Xen server host itself,\nthey recommend 16.\n\n235\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.010\nNow, even though they say that\nin their own documentation,\n\n236\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.570\nthey go look, you can have as\nmany XenServers as you want to.\n\n237\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.910\nThe recommendation, though, is if you\ncluster and you do high availability,\n\n238\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.710\nup to 16 is the max.\n\n239\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.100\nBut they put in parentheses\nthis is not enforced.\n\n240\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:49.180\nSo you can have larger ones if you choose\nto but there's nothing that says why 16 or\n\n241\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.910\nwhy you can do more or what does\nmore do for you or less do for you.\n\n242\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm almost wondering if they just\nwouldn't support that if you're running\n\n243\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.140\nthe interface version, just for\nthe sake of technical support.\n\n244\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be that once they get\npast a certain point, they're saying hey,\n\n245\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.800\nmore directly it does work because\npeople are prior reported to work but\n\n246\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.010\nthey said that this is not\na rule that they enforce.\n\n247\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.970\nSo even though their recommendation or\n\n248\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.530\nthey'll recognize limit I guess what\nthey've tested and what they've is 16.\n\n249\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.010\nThey probably not try to push it beyond\nthat but people are probably record them\n\n250\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.140\nlike, no we've got 48 of them and running\nas a single cluster every one and two.\n\n251\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.970\nBut for now that's what you wanna do, so\nyou can continue to add in more and more.\n\n252\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.600\nAnd this allows you now of course,\nthen to be able to start\n\n253\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.510\ncreating VM's on each of these\nmachines as we have it, right?\n\n254\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:47.030\nSo each one of these Xen server host can\nnow have their own machines if we do that.\n\n255\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:52.052\nNow running separate virtual machines\non different host is perfectly fine and\n\n256\n00:14:52.052 --> 00:14:55.474\nwe can do that and\nthat's how we're gonna begin, but\n\n257\n00:14:55.474 --> 00:15:00.266\nultimately what we really want to do\nthrough this show as well is to actually\n\n258\n00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.570\nbring it in to a clustering nature.\n\n259\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.718\nWhat we're gonna cluster\ntogether are Xen servers and\n\n260\n00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:08.525\nthen from that point we'll\nmanage them as one and\n\n261\n00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:12.910\nthen we'll also a shared storage\nfacility to do so as well, okay.\n\n262\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.200\nSo we're just gonna focus in\ncurrently just on Xen server 01, so\n\n263\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.920\net me go ahead and just connect\nXEN Server 02 right now, so we're\n\n264\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.330\nnot trying to or I'm not trying to kinda\nlook at both of them at the same time.\n\n265\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.580\nAnd then we'll start here at the beginning\nof some of the things that we need to do\n\n266\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.690\nwhen we get started.\n\n267\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.470\nIf I am going to begin building a VM,\n\n268\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.150\nand that's what we want to do Is\nwe are gonna start off by saying,\n\n269\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.130\nall right,\nwhat do I need to actually create a VM?\n\n270\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.558\nOne is I need of course\nthe installation media itself.\n\n271\n00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:53.393\nSo wherever my ISOs are, I need to\nbe able to make sure that the Zen\n\n272\n00:15:53.393 --> 00:15:57.166\nserver can access the ISOs\nthat I'm going to use.\n\n273\n00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:01.043\nNow that means if I have\na DVD inside of my server,\n\n274\n00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:04.600\nI can go there and place a DVD in there.\n\n275\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.480\nAnd then see if it actually recognizes and\nI'm off, and I'm ready to go.\n\n276\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.780\nBut more than likely, the way that we\nare going to install a VM is we're gonna\n\n277\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:19.660\nlook for what we call an iso repository or\na storage repository to help us out.\n\n278\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.280\nThis is where XenServer\n7.0 has helped us out.\n\n279\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.180\nIn the past it used to be where you\nhad to create a special CIFS, C-I-F-S,\n\n280\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:38.550\nwhich of course is your compact disk\ntype of format file system here.\n\n281\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:43.060\nSo that you could do this or CDFS you\nmight have heard that as well, but\n\n282\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.850\nthat's what we are normally need to\nhave that accessible VM creation.\n\n283\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.341\nThe problem with that is that\nit really did kinda take it and\n\n284\n00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:55.336\nput into a special grouping, but\n\n285\n00:16:55.336 --> 00:17:00.620\nyou can then instead now with Zensensor\nbecause it natively now supports SMB.\n\n286\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.640\nIs if you already have an existing\nfile share somewhere that has an ISO\n\n287\n00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.560\nfolder on it, where you store all\nyour ISOs, you can access that and\n\n288\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:16.250\nit can become your central repository for\nall your ISO images instead, too.\n\n289\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.850\nSo that's where we'd\nneed to begin as well.\n\n290\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:24.460\n&gt;&gt; We kind of mentioned this in the\nprevious episode but also keep in mind,\n\n291\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.870\ndepending on what your doing and what\ntime of day it is within your network.\n\n292\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.490\nI mean depending if you have\na couple people pulling\n\n293\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.445\ndown iso's at the same time.\n\n294\n00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:35.425\nSame time, you don't wanna slow\ndown your current network and\n\n295\n00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:36.945\nhalt production in any way.\n\n296\n00:17:36.945 --> 00:17:39.475\nSo you might wanna just keep that\nin mind before you go ahead and\n\n297\n00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.535\nbegin that process.\n\n298\n00:17:40.535 --> 00:17:43.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that this\ncan do it, but the nice thing,\n\n299\n00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:47.495\nif you keep your ISOs separated out,\n\n300\n00:17:47.495 --> 00:17:50.145\nhopefully not everybody's building\nmachines the same time you are.\n\n301\n00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:55.000\nBut it is possible or that can happen,\nand then you will have some performance\n\n302\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.910\nrestrictions that you don't\nwant to keep in mind.\n\n303\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.980\nSo, that's what we're gonna do first\nbefore we really begin to install and\n\n304\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:07.090\nbuild a VM here, is that we're gonna\nstart off, of course, with just creating\n\n305\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:13.310\nthat central storage repository of\nhow we can get access to that folder.\n\n306\n00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:18.220\nNow the great thing is I've already got\nan SMB storage shared up and running.\n\n307\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.758\nWhether there's several different\nISOs that are available for me, and\n\n308\n00:18:20.758 --> 00:18:21.845\nI just need to connect to them.\n\n309\n00:18:21.845 --> 00:18:23.021\n&gt;&gt; Look at you overachiever.\n\n310\n00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:23.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.\n\n311\n00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:26.362\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's either that, or to try\n\n312\n00:18:26.362 --> 00:18:30.040\nand build it from scratch and then find\nevery ISO out online, and bring it in.\n\n313\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.660\nSo I thought I'd go ahead and\ndo that ahead of time.\n\n314\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.230\nSo what do we need to do?\n\n315\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.050\nNow, this is, we're gonna start off with\njust working as a single Zen server for\n\n316\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.790\nright now and\nthen we'll talk about clustering later on.\n\n317\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.780\nLets go ahead back to\nthe computer here and\n\n318\n00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.060\nthat way we're just\ngoing to work with this.\n\n319\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.180\nIf you have a single Zen server and\n\n320\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.800\nthat's all your ever gonna have you do not\nnecessarily have to do this, like we said.\n\n321\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.040\nYou have all your iso's on DVD's,\nput them in one at a time if you want to,\n\n322\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.270\nperfectly good.\n\n323\n00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.730\nBut if you do have that\ncentral repository, and\n\n324\n00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.300\nyou go I know that it's out there and\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n325\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.150\nEverybody's been using it and\n\n326\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.560\nit's been perfectly fine,\nyou can also use that one instead.\n\n327\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.850\nAnd that's what we want to\nnormally set up for, okay.\n\n328\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.400\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n329\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.650\nNow the way that we do that Is that\nwe're adding in essentially a new\n\n330\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:19.690\nstorage device.\n\n331\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.650\nIs what we're doing, so\nI'm gonna click on new storage.\n\n332\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:30.600\nAnd once I'm inside of new storage,\nNotice that there's different\n\n333\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.810\nvirtual disk storage that's available to\nus, which we are gonna talk about as well.\n\n334\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.330\nBut for right now at the very\nbeginning when we install,\n\n335\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.930\nwe need to get access to\nwhat we call an ISO library.\n\n336\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.210\nNow we have two different options, there\nof course is the Windows file sharing.\n\n337\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.160\nThat is the one that I've chosen because\nI already have one up and running.\n\n338\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.950\nAnd it says this actually gives you\nthat if you have it available as\n\n339\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.160\na Windows share.\n\n340\n00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.840\nYou can attach it directly to those,\nor if you're running NFS, right,\n\n341\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.860\nthe Network File System,\nyou can also do that one, as well.\n\n342\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.950\nAnd that gives you the ability to,\nof course, pretty much do the same thing.\n\n343\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.610\nThe connection's just a little bit\ndifferent, and that's why they gave you\n\n344\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.430\nan option here inside of their\nwalk-through menu or their WIzard.\n\n345\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.130\nOnce I select, I click Next,\nnow you have to give it a name.\n\n346\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.920\nNow I could leave at the default name,\nbut I tend to\n\n347\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.480\nchange it to just ISO library because\nthat makes a little bit more sense to me.\n\n348\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.170\nAnd I normally leave this\nchecked where it says,\n\n349\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:34.260\nAuto generate description based on the SR,\nwhich means storage repository Settings,\n\n350\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.230\nso this will generate a unique ID inside\nof Zensensor for what we’re doing here.\n\n351\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.420\nIt’s not so important to you and\nme, as far naming it goes,\n\n352\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.320\nbut it important to Zensar so\nit can identified it.\n\n353\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.820\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n354\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Click next here and\nnow I need to access and\n\n355\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.170\nfind where that share is going to be.\n\n356\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.885\nSo the great thing is we\ncan do this by IP address.\n\n357\n00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:08.337\nBut on this particular machine which\nis a Windows machine that's running,\n\n358\n00:21:08.337 --> 00:21:13.380\nI know that I cannot use\nmine without credentials.\n\n359\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.945\nSo I need to be able to get access into\nthem, so I'm gonna put a check here.\n\n360\n00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:24.487\nAnd then administrator,\nand then my password here.\n\n361\n00:21:27.606 --> 00:21:30.260\nNow you're probably saying,\nyou mean you're logging on as mister?\n\n362\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.775\nYes, for the purpose of testing\nI am because I was too lazy\n\n363\n00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:38.735\nto come up with a new username,\nyes so that was me.\n\n364\n00:21:38.735 --> 00:21:41.530\n&gt;&gt; It's all right,\nwe won't hold it against you Ronnie.\n\n365\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.300\n&gt;&gt; So good, because if you do,\nwe're going to have a really short show.\n\n366\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.900\nSo at this point once we have all that,\nnotice it didn't take any time at all.\n\n367\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.110\nBut we are now connected\nto what it says is an ISO\n\n368\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.060\nlibrary and it gives me the description\nof where that's connected to as well.\n\n369\n00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.640\nSo, there is the regular UMC\npath name that we see and\n\n370\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.350\nyou might be wondering like I do,\nhow do we know that's actually there?\n\n371\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.160\nHow do we know that it's\nactually going to work for us?\n\n372\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.150\nThe way we do it is we click storage,\nand now you can see there's a release of\n\n373\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.100\na lot of different ISO's that\nwe've had available that we use.\n\n374\n00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:27.100\nEven in our show production and\neven in production itself available to us.\n\n375\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.340\nSo, we're gonna set up,\n\n376\n00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.520\nlet's say we're gonna set up this\nWindows Server 2012 machine.\n\n377\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n378\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.670\nwe're also gonna probably set up a set\nOS machine is what we're going to do\n\n379\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.040\nas just an example, so\nthat we can do both a Windows and\n\n380\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.780\na Linux setup to be able\nto get started there.\n\n381\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But at this point here,\n\n382\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.370\nwe're really kind of at the very\nbeginning, where we now have just about\n\n383\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.730\neverything in place,\nas we're managing a single Zen server.\n\n384\n00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.800\nWe need to make sure then as we get ready\nto install a virtual machine that, first,\n\n385\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.980\nwe can get Zen Server installed in,\n\n386\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.250\nor not, yeah, the Zen Server\ninstalled into Zen Center, okay.\n\n387\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.480\nOnce we get that installed,\nthen we need to go back in and\n\n388\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.940\nmake sure that we can now access\nthe files that we need to And that's\n\n389\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.920\nwhy we created the ISOLibrary and if you\nhave it ready to go you can do that.\n\n390\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:26.160\nNow I do have to put one caveat in\nthere that has always tripped me out,\n\n391\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.170\nI don't know why it does but it happens\nevery time that I have done this.\n\n392\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.950\nWhen you try and\ndo this especially with SMB share\n\n393\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.470\nyou'll find out something\nimmediately here you might go,\n\n394\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.840\nwell, what if I wanted to store\nit directly on that server?\n\n395\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.930\nIt doesn't want you to connect to itself,\nso in other words,\n\n396\n00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.840\nyour SMB Central Share needs\nto be on another devices.\n\n397\n00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why,\n\n398\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.600\nI don't know what the limitation is\nbehind that, I'm sure somebody does.\n\n399\n00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.160\nBut at this point, you'll see if you try\nto put in the same IP address to itself,\n\n400\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.010\nis this, no, I'm not going to use it, it\njust tells it's just not going to connect.\n\n401\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.150\nBut once you move that SNB\nstorage off that same device,\n\n402\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.005\nthen you can You can go and\nyou can access it from there.\n\n403\n00:24:08.005 --> 00:24:10.445\nIt works perfectly fine\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure\n\n404\n00:24:10.445 --> 00:24:12.670\nthat'll save someone a headache.\n\n405\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It saves you headaches as long as you\n\n406\n00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:17.015\nremember it, and the only time I\nremember it is when I get the error,\n\n407\n00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:19.985\nwhich should kind of teach me something.\n\n408\n00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:24.215\nBut that's probably been 10 times\nwhen I've gone [NOISE] that's right I\n\n409\n00:24:24.215 --> 00:24:27.634\nneed to make sure that I access\nit from a different machine.\n\n410\n00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:31.904\nOver all but the great thing is now we\nhave our resources that are ready and\n\n411\n00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:36.602\navailable for us to go and that means the\nnext step for us is going to be installing\n\n412\n00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:37.355\n&gt;&gt; Windows\n\n413\n00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:39.448\n&gt;&gt; AVM and get ready to go, but\n\n414\n00:24:39.448 --> 00:24:43.300\nI think I have actually\nrun out of time again.\n\n415\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.070\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n416\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.200\nI know, we always do this.\n\n417\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.410\nWe run out of time, but\nthat's perfectly fine because\n\n418\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.820\nwe have another show headed your way,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n419\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.060\nSo stay tuned, Ronnie, thank you for\njoining us and thank you ladies and\n\n420\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.860\ngentlemen, but we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this particular show.\n\n421\n00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.840\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n422\n00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n423\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.030\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n424\n00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:10.976\n[MUSIC]\n\n425\n00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:14.128\nThank you for watching

00:00:11.855\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:14.063\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix ZenServer show.\n\n5\n00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:16.453\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:21.310\nThis is actually a continuation of part\ntwo from a previous episode where we\n\n7\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.633\nwere setting up virtual machines.\n\n8\n00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.067\nWe didn't get too far, we went\nthrough the process of creating them.\n\n9\n00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:30.495\nBut actually installing the operating\nsystem is where we left off.\n\n10\n00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.391\nSo to pick right back up, we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.891\nRonnie Wong in studios to walk us\nthrough this step by step process.\n\n12\n00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.220\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\nsince it is true we named episode creating\n\n14\n00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.520\na VM and we never got to create a VM, so\nI guess we should actually begin there.\n\n15\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.090\n&gt;&gt; That would be nice.\n\n16\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.090\n&gt;&gt; At some point to maybe keep in line\nwith the theme of the show at least\n\n17\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.786\nas we continue on and\ntaking a look at ZenServer here.\n\n18\n00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.360\nRemember, ZenServer is\na very powerful tool and\n\n19\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.400\nwe've just shown you at least\nthe setup that you need to have.\n\n20\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760\nRemember that key here of course,\n\n21\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.830\nis getting access of course to your media\nfiles that you would normally have.\n\n22\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.480\nSo for our example, we're going to\ninstall a Windows machine, we're gonna do\n\n23\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.930\na Window Server 2012 machine to\ngive us a Windows operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.560\nWe're also just gonna install the bare\nminimum of let's say Cent OS.\n\n25\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.320\nWe'll just do 6.2 cuz that's\nthe one that I have access to.\n\n26\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.210\nThe minimum install and that's to\nhelp us save a little bit of time.\n\n27\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.880\nBut just to show you we can do both.\n\n28\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.480\nNow there's a little bit of\ninformation that we need to add in at\n\n29\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.360\nthe end of the install.\n\n30\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.060\nSo we'll make sure that\nwe get that in there and\n\n31\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.410\nwe'll show you that the way\nthat you do it in Windows.\n\n32\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.990\nAnd then of course, the way that\nyou have to do it inside of Linux.\n\n33\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710\nNot exactly super difficult\ninside of Linux, but\n\n34\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.160\nit does require you to have a little bit\nmore knowledge to do that in comparison.\n\n35\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.650\nSo let's go ahead and\nget started with these installs and\n\n36\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.350\nthen we'll kind of talk about them.\n\n37\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.970\nAs we go through and\nsome of the things that we can create and\n\n38\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.840\nwe can control as we continue\nthrough here as well.\n\n39\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.930\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at\n\n40\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.960\nthe machine and-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n41\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.070\n&gt;&gt; And let's see what we have to do.\n\n42\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.450\nSo here, inside of my Xen Server,\nwe're just gonna focus in on XENSRV01.\n\n43\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.180\nAs if we are just using that one single\nXen Server and that's the only thing that\n\n44\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.310\nwill actually kind of deal with\nat this particular point in time.\n\n45\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.000\nNow, since I have my\nISO Library ready to go,\n\n46\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.360\nit now means that I can\nbegin in creating a new VM.\n\n47\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.510\nOnce again, inside of XEN Server, notice\nthey have these nice little pretty icons.\n\n48\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.653\nThey're not that prettiest,\nbut they're at least colorful.\n\n49\n00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.233\n&gt;&gt; They're pretty user centric, yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.940\n&gt;&gt; They're fairly user friendly for us.\n\n51\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.360\nAnd I can click on a Create a New VM.\n\n52\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.610\nInside, I've created a new VM, they give\nme options to select pre-built templates.\n\n53\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.310\nTemplates are very helpful for\n\n54\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.310\nus, because essentially they setup what we\nbelieve the hardware should be like for\n\n55\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.370\nan install of whatever operating\nsystem that we choose.\n\n56\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.040\nSo instead of me having to go in and\nsay here's the amount of RAM I need and\n\n57\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.250\nhere's the basic size hard drive, here's\nall the other things and network adapter.\n\n58\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.160\nIt says let me go ahead and\ncreate a template and\n\n59\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.210\nthat way you can choose\nfrom this list that we see.\n\n60\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.800\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nif we scroll down the list, Ronnie,\n\n61\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.840\nI'm just kind of curious to see what kind\nof operating systems there might be.\n\n62\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.210\nBecause for things like Windows,\nthey have a pretty\n\n63\n00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.990\ntight schedule where they go ahead and\nrelease new operating systems.\n\n64\n00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.980\nBut if we're talking about different\ntypes of Linux distributions,\n\n65\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.590\nthat could get a little hairy, right?\n\n66\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.544\n&gt;&gt; It can because they do [LAUGH] tend\nrelease versions pretty quickly inside of\n\n67\n00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:35.130\nLinux.\n\n68\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.220\nJust about every six months or so.\n\n69\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.840\nBut they don't give us like\nif there's a 7.5 and stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.901\nBut you'll see for\n\n71\n00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:45.555\nexample right here, where they do\ngive you the majority of them.\n\n72\n00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:49.327\nSometimes you'll actually see like the\nearlier ones were much more detailed, 4.5,\n\n73\n00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:50.543\n4.6, 4.7, 4.8.\n\n74\n00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:51.227\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n75\n00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:57.170\n&gt;&gt; But then you go to the five versions\nand then they just give 64 and 32.\n\n76\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.110\nSix, I only have six and same thing.\n\n77\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.080\nAnd seven, so they tend to jump in\nthose incremental numbers in that way.\n\n78\n00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.630\nNow that's not the only\nversion that's available.\n\n79\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.260\nOf course, there's some DBN and Core OS.\n\n80\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.070\nThere's an Oracle Enterprise Linux\ndown here as well.\n\n81\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.000\nGoing to Red Hat,\nnotice that there is actually Red Hat.\n\n82\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you're just choosing a\nflavor, then you would pick that umbrella\n\n83\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.612\noperating system that it was generated\nfrom and then it will be good to go.\n\n84\n00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n85\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.200\nAnd that's because they went ahead and\ntry to make it easier for the user to come\n\n86\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.660\nin and go I don't remember what\nthe minimal requirements for this.\n\n87\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.160\nSo you can try and\npick the ones that are fairly close.\n\n88\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.341\nHere's one for Ubuntu,\nLucid Linux Meerkat.\n\n89\n00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:44.075\nMeerkat?\n\n90\n00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.667\nLook at that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n91\n00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.460\n&gt;&gt; Precise Pangolin,\nI don't know what a Pangolin is.\n\n92\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.403\nTrusty Tar, I don't know what\na Tar is either or a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n93\n00:04:53.403 --> 00:04:55.151\nYep, don't have any of that.\n\n94\n00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.828\nI don't have a clue on that one.\n\n95\n00:04:56.828 --> 00:04:59.710\nAnd if you want to create your own-\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love those Linux names.\n\n96\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanted to create your own\ncustom one though, down here at the bottom\n\n97\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.080\nwhere it says Other Install Media,\nyou have that ability as well to see that.\n\n98\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.020\nSo it is there for you, it says if you\nplan to use an operating system over on\n\n99\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.490\nthis side on the right-hand side,\nthat is not listed.\n\n100\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.470\nYou may be able to install it\nby selecting this template.\n\n101\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.390\nWe only recommend it if you really\nhave experienced this before.\n\n102\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.060\nIf you haven't,\nthey're saying trust our templates.\n\n103\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.630\nWe'll help you to get started the right\nway, is the key that they want to get to.\n\n104\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.620\nSo I'm gonna choose that Windows\ninstall for 2012 R2 first.\n\n105\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.190\nI have an evaluation copy\nof Windows 2012 R2 and\n\n106\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.610\nthat's why I'm choosing that one as well.\n\n107\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.900\nAnd then we have one more\noption down here at the bottom,\n\n108\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.460\nwhich is something that most of us\nare probably never gonna use where it says\n\n109\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.120\nCopy host BIOS strings to the VM here.\n\n110\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.990\nWhat is that?\n\n111\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.610\nCherokee, have you ever\nheard of BIOS strings?\n\n112\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.470\n&gt;&gt; Not that I can recall\nwhen I'm setting up a VM,\n\n113\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.170\nnot in Hyper-V any ways that I can\nrecall off the top of my head.\n\n114\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's kind of a little bit of strange, so\n\n115\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.580\nyou're like what in\nthe world it this about?\n\n116\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.920\nWell, what they can allow you to do and\nthis is probably something more of\n\n117\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.330\na specialized environment that\nyou would choose to do this.\n\n118\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.800\nBut all of us may be in a production\nenvironment that have purchased\n\n119\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.605\ndesktops that already have the operating\nsystem installed on them, let's say for\n\n120\n00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:23.875\nexample, from Dell, right?\n\n121\n00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:25.925\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What those installations of\n\n122\n00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:29.975\nthat operating system are really key\nthen to that Dell product itself.\n\n123\n00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:30.695\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n124\n00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:33.535\n&gt;&gt; And when you do something like that,\nthat makes it very difficult\n\n125\n00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:37.535\nthen to actually take an image of it and\nthen move it to another machine.\n\n126\n00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:38.205\nOkay?\n\n127\n00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:42.250\nSo what you can do here\ninstead is you can copy\n\n128\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.960\nthe BIOS essentials from\nan image like that.\n\n129\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.290\nOne that's really designed\nfrom the manufacturer to say,\n\n130\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.560\nthis BIOS is fresh and it's pretty\nmuch key to our machines this way.\n\n131\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.280\nAnd that way when you check that,\nit will build it along those versions too.\n\n132\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.430\nSo if you're building images and\nyou're doing stuff that, you can do this\n\n133\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.130\ninside of a virtual environment\ninstead of going let me see, let me.\n\n134\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.636\nCherokee is not using her PC right now,\nlet me go ahead and just gab her PC.\n\n135\n00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:11.980\nCherokee will well, what happened?\n\n136\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.310\nI need to build an image.\n\n137\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.370\nSo instead,\nyou can copy it directly here and\n\n138\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.578\nthen you can deploy that image\nif you need too as well.\n\n139\n00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:22.360\nIt's kind of neat in what you can do,\n\n140\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.320\nbut most of us are probably\nnot gonna do that very often.\n\n141\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.230\nBecause it really is,\nit's fairly specialized here.\n\n142\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.275\nThey even provide that option for\nyou if you choose to, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:32.870\nSo I'm gonna click Next here.\n\n144\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.150\nAnd then of course, you want to\ngive it a name that you want to do.\n\n145\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.172\nSo everybody always gives it something,\nI'm just gonna do,\n\n146\n00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:48.737\nlet's see, itprotvdemo,\nI'm gonna do it all in lowercase.\n\n147\n00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:57.316\nAnd I'll do a dash here and\nwe'll just call it webserv01 instead.\n\n148\n00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:59.663\nSo this is just saying hey,\n\n149\n00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:04.570\nI'm gonna indicate that this\nis a web server Click Next.\n\n150\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:10.480\nAnd now here is where we would be lost\nif we don't have that ISO library.\n\n151\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.279\nAnd if I have the DVD inside of the DVD\ndriver itself it should appear.\n\n152\n00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:20.770\nOops [INAUDIBLE],\nit should appear right here.\n\n153\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.470\nNotice it specifies, which I'm not gonna\nbe able to say either, on Xen server 01.\n\n154\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.782\nSo there is a physical DVD\ndrive on that machine.\n\n155\n00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:34.691\nLike they're saying if you want to insert\nin insert it in now I'll find it and\n\n156\n00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:37.870\nI'll be able to install it if you need to,\nokay?\n\n157\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.690\nAs nice as that is, remember optical media\ncan be scratched very easily especially if\n\n158\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.876\nyou're moving it from one\nmachine to the other.\n\n159\n00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:48.559\nBut now that I have selected and\ncreated that storage repository,\n\n160\n00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:53.491\nnotice I now have access to what my\nfull ISO Library itself which is what\n\n161\n00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.017\nthe top of the list says right here.\n\n162\n00:08:56.017 --> 00:09:02.936\nAnd then I'm wanna scroll down and\nselect the EN server 2012 R2E edition.\n\n163\n00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:06.143\nBut notice I can also boot from\nthe network and actually create and\n\n164\n00:09:06.143 --> 00:09:07.200\ninstall if I want to.\n\n165\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.220\nSo if I already have PXE boot setup,\nI can do that.\n\n166\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.190\nNow it says,\nhey place the VM on which server?\n\n167\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.040\nBecause I have not actually\ndone anything else and\n\n168\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.320\nI'm treating this as a separate\nindividual install on XenServer 01,\n\n169\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.560\nit's already saying, hey,\nhere's what you have available to go.\n\n170\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.930\nSo it says what's gonna\nbe the home machine?\n\n171\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.560\nNow, at this point you're looking at it\nlike, man, that's not gonna be big enough.\n\n172\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.130\nIt's saying 6.9 available, total of 8GB.\n\n173\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.830\nIs that right?\n\n174\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.790\nWell, to a point, right?\n\n175\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.210\nWhat they're saying is that the VM,\n\n176\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.950\nnow this is where the terminology\ngets strange, right?\n\n177\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.700\nThe VM itself is different\nfrom the hard drive\n\n178\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.860\nthat we're gonna install\nthe operating system on.\n\n179\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.840\nSo this is all\nthe configuration information,\n\n180\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.690\nall the hardware information\nthat we talk about.\n\n181\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.300\nSo here is saying, yeah,\nare you sure you want this?\n\n182\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.440\nWell, for right now,\nlet's go ahead and do so.\n\n183\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.390\nAnd of course then it's\ngiving us the standard here.\n\n184\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.370\nWhere it says hey, what's the number\nof CPUs do you have available?\n\n185\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.150\nAnd of course the typology here.\n\n186\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.630\nSo notice 1 socket with\n1 core per socket here.\n\n187\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.940\nAnd it's saying, how many do you want?\n\n188\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.960\nYou can over subscribe\nit if you choose to.\n\n189\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.550\nSo even if your own physical host itself\nlet's say has a quad core processor and\n\n190\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.950\nyou wanna give it 8 processors.\n\n191\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.200\nIn theory you can, but if you read\nthe documentation it says, look adding in\n\n192\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.640\nmore than what the physical host has is\nnot gonna give you any more performance.\n\n193\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.200\nAnd in fact, it may degrade\nthe performance so you wanna max it out at\n\n194\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.520\nwhatever your physical processor\nis if you choose to do that.\n\n195\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.970\nMost of the time a single virtual CPU\nwill do and you're pretty much fine.\n\n196\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.930\nOf course, the same thing with memory.\n\n197\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.520\nYou do have to be careful here\non memory when you install this.\n\n198\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.280\nYou can over subscribe the memory too.\n\n199\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.250\nEspecially if you have what we\ncall dynamic memory going on.\n\n200\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.690\nSo you do wanna make sure that\nyou pay attention there as well.\n\n201\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Another thing you might wanna pay\nattention to would be your licensing\n\n202\n00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.130\nbecause the way if we're setting up\na Microsoft server machine here.\n\n203\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.080\nThe way Microsoft actually\ndistributes their licensing\n\n204\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.780\none of the sales models is\nbased upon the use of CPUs.\n\n205\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.110\nSo we kinda wanna keep that in mind,\nI'm sure as well.\n\n206\n00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:31.120\nIt's not a physical CPU, but\nit's still being utilized as one.\n\n207\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.604\n&gt;&gt; It really does depend on the way that\nthat licensing works, and how it works in\n\n208\n00:11:34.604 --> 00:11:37.983\nvirtualization, so make sure you check\nthe documentation before you go,\n\n209\n00:11:37.983 --> 00:11:41.167\nlet's give it 16, and see what\nthe licensing model turns out to be.\n\n210\n00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:44.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That may overwhelm you before you know\n\n211\n00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:47.830\nit, but\nlet's just leave it at its default here.\n\n212\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.390\nAnd then we can click Next.\n\n213\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.280\nNow, this one that says,\nyou can improve graphics performance\n\n214\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.790\nby assigning dedicated graphics\nprocessing unit to a VM.\n\n215\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.720\nHowever, no GPUs have been\ndetected on this server.\n\n216\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.760\nSo this option is not available.\n\n217\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.420\nSo this means it went into my machine,\nand it said,\n\n218\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.970\nlook, I don't see an extra GPU in here.\n\n219\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.330\nSo, because of that I'm not even\ngiving you the option to add this in.\n\n220\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.780\nOne of the greatest things that they've\ndone in terms of Xen Center 7.0 is\n\n221\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.336\nthat they've given you the ability,\nright, to actually work with the GPU.\n\n222\n00:12:22.336 --> 00:12:24.483\nSo it can do extra compute power, but\n\n223\n00:12:24.483 --> 00:12:27.820\nactually make your display\nlook pretty descent as well.\n\n224\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.066\nSo just kind of realize\nthat you have that, but\n\n225\n00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:33.830\nif you're all like me on my particular\nserver here, it's a little bit older and\n\n226\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.880\nit's not gonna have a GPU located.\n\n227\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.320\nAnd this is where we get into the storage.\n\n228\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.180\nSo remember a little bit earlier when I\nsaid the virtual machine is gonna reside\n\n229\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.070\non which one and it only showed\n6.9 gigs or whatever it was.\n\n230\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.420\nWell now it's saying look at this,\nhere's your hard drive.\n\n231\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.700\nSo the virtual machine template you\nselected earlier, now you finish\n\n232\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.350\nconfiguration and now it's saying here's\nhow much storage it's gonna take up.\n\n233\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.620\nAnd this one just says 32 GB.\n\n234\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.460\nNow I know something as far as the bare\nminimum install of Windows Server,\n\n235\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.530\n32 gigs seems a little bit tight,\ndoesn't it?\n\n236\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n237\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwhat would you recommend as far as a size?\n\n238\n00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:13.190\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, go big or go home.\n\n239\n00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.570\nBut it depends in a production environment\nreally what you have to begin with, right?\n\n240\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.690\nI don't know what we set\nup originally here so.\n\n241\n00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well this is the one\nthat the template recommends,\n\n242\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.880\nwhich is a little bit strange cuz I know\nthat by default at least from what I\n\n243\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.360\nremember it used to be a 40 gig minimum.\n\n244\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.890\nOkay?\n\n245\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.680\nTo install in a 64 bit edition of well,\nServer 2012.\n\n246\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.920\nNow, I could be wrong,\nthat might have changed over time.\n\n247\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think.\n\n248\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.480\nI can't think exactly,\nmaybe give me a second here.\n\n249\n00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.500\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to boot this up here\nto 64 gigs instead for right now, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.170\nNow by doing this, right, I'm at\nleast doubling what the bare minimum\n\n251\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.110\nis of the template that it's\ngiven us which is great.\n\n252\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.370\nWhich is what we want.\n\n253\n00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.520\nBut overall though,\nI'm not going overboard cuz\n\n254\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.490\nI may actually run out of hard\ndrive space if I'm not careful.\n\n255\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.060\nThe great thing is, I can tell right here\nhow much of the hard drive is free and\n\n256\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.380\navailable for me.\n\n257\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.870\nSo it says there's 105 free,\nI could max it out to 100 if I want to.\n\n258\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:17.080\nBut at this point I'm just gonna take up\nabout 64 gigs of this storage right now.\n\n259\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.810\nJust gonna click OK.\n\n260\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.290\nAnd then, unless Cherokee\nhas found some information.\n\n261\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.890\n&gt;&gt; So did we install Essentials, or\nwhat version of that, do you know?\n\n262\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.660\nOkay, so they're recommending 160 gig\nhard disk with a 60 gig system partition.\n\n263\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.550\nAnd you also have to think about what kind\nof rules and features are you gonna be\n\n264\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.190\ninstalling on that machine, so I would\nsay that's kind of low there originally.\n\n265\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.200\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n266\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, that's fine.\n\n267\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.930\nWe'll do 64,I know this will work.\n\n268\n00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n269\n00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.700\n&gt;&gt; That'll work for us.\n\n270\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.201\nThe other one of course is the ability\nto create this nick here, okay?\n\n271\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.350\nNow for us, remember that in\nthe virtual machine it's not\n\n272\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.890\nreally directly connected\nto the physical nick.\n\n273\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.270\nSo here we have a virtual machine template\nthat gives a virtual network interface as\n\n274\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:03.890\nwell, and this one's gonna autogenerate\na Mac address for me instead,\n\n275\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.820\nand it's also gonna put it in what we call\na Network Zero, which is just a name for\n\n276\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.050\na network at this point, or a name for\nwhat we call a virtual switch.\n\n277\n00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.910\nIf I want to modify that I\ncan click on properties.\n\n278\n00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.250\nIf I had multiple networks I could choose\nwhat network I wanted to attach it to or\n\n279\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.360\na physical, or a switch,\na virtual switch and\n\n280\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.350\nI can auto generate the MAC address\nwhich is usually what we would do.\n\n281\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.370\nBut notice, I can instead be able\nto spoof another MAC address.\n\n282\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.850\nWell why in the world would I\nchoose to do that you might ask?\n\n283\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.250\nThat's silly, why would you\never want to choose to do that?\n\n284\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.670\nIf you remember the situation I was\ntelling you about at the beginning,\n\n285\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.890\nwhere you might have that piece\nof equipment that comes in from\n\n286\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:50.060\nthe manufacturer, with everything kind of\nkeyed in, maybe even that one machine.\n\n287\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.556\nWell, an important part\nof that is right here.\n\n288\n00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:57.400\nSo I could instead take the MAC\naddress of that physical machine and\n\n289\n00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.070\nalso put it here too, so\nthat when it does install it says, Yep,\n\n290\n00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.769\nthat looks the same machine as well.\n\n291\n00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:09.539\nSo not only can I generate the Biostring,\nbut I can also do the Mac as well.\n\n292\n00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Ron would you think that by changing,\nI know in Microsoft environments,\n\n293\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.120\nyou can tell by the Mac address,\nif it is a virtual machine.\n\n294\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.050\nSo would you ever wanna\nchange that to maybe\n\n295\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.290\nconceal the idea that it's a virtual\nmachine, for security reasons?\n\n296\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:28.350\n&gt;&gt; I guess you could, if one of your\nreasons behind it, of course, is security.\n\n297\n00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.220\nThat is a possibility that you\nwould change that, if it has some\n\n298\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.450\nparticular sequence that everybody\nrecognizes it as being virtual machine.\n\n299\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.190\nSometimes, they are randomly generated,\n\n300\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.990\nsometimes they are actually\nfollowing what they choose to.\n\n301\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.350\nSo yeah, you could, and I don't see\nany reason that you can't do that.\n\n302\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.230\nSo yeah, why not?\n\n303\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.980\nOf course, there is also course\nquality service limitations, so\n\n304\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.690\nthat way we can hard set the limit\nof things that may come by.\n\n305\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.140\nNormally, we might do something like this\nif we were setting up a VoIP server, but\n\n306\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.590\nwe're going to leave it at the auto\ngenerate, click Next and now it gives\n\n307\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.930\nus details that we would simply review,\nand we verify that everything is working,\n\n308\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.720\nwe can go back and change this\nstuff later okay, if we need to.\n\n309\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.990\nIf this doesn’t fit the requirements, the\ninstall is not going to proceed through,\n\n310\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.750\nso that’s another thing that we have.\n\n311\n00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.368\nSo right now,\n\n312\n00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:21.640\nI'm gonna click that button down that's\na little bit behind my head here.\n\n313\n00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.525\nLet me see if I can move that over and\nscroll out a little bit and\n\n314\n00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:29.666\nthen we're kind of zoomed in a little\nbit more where it says Create Now.\n\n315\n00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:35.190\nAnd when it's generating is going to be,\nand you'll actually see this in\n\n316\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.790\nthe lower right hand corner screen behind\nmy head here, we might need full screen.\n\n317\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.700\nYou'll see that it actually has a little\ngreen bar that's going across here,\n\n318\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.412\nthat tells me when that\nvirtual machine is ready.\n\n319\n00:17:44.412 --> 00:17:49.028\nThen, over on the left hand\nside in my navigation tree,\n\n320\n00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:53.955\nI can see that the virtual\nmachine itself has been created.\n\n321\n00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:56.742\nNow when I say that,\nit doesn't mean that it's ready to go,\n\n322\n00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.554\nWindows has popped up and we're, no.\n\n323\n00:17:58.554 --> 00:18:03.496\nIt means that the machine environment,\nright, that virtual environment is now\n\n324\n00:18:03.496 --> 00:18:08.320\nfinished and now, I need to make sure\nthen that it is beginning it's install.\n\n325\n00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.209\nSo I selected it and\nbecause that it rebooted and\n\n326\n00:18:11.209 --> 00:18:16.235\nit started off here, I would come in here\nafter I select that virtual machine,\n\n327\n00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:21.515\nover on the right hand side, I would go to\nthe console which essentially is the same\n\n328\n00:18:21.515 --> 00:18:26.065\nas my monitoring port and\nyou can see the install really beginning.\n\n329\n00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:28.975\nThis process and\nwhat it has to do to go through and\n\n330\n00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:31.345\ndo the install at the end here, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:34.290\nSo that's kind of at least\nthe beginning process.\n\n332\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.080\nThere's still more steps that\nwe have to go through of course,\n\n333\n00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.721\nto finish up the installation, but right\nthere is really where we are going to,\n\n334\n00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:44.790\nto kind of leave it off and then we'll\ncome back and finish the installation.\n\n335\n00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.583\nI want to also take advantage of the time\nthat we have available to us as well and\n\n336\n00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.610\nwe also go through a Linux install too.\n\n337\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.540\nSo in a moment, this is gonna click up\nhere, but let me see if I can go ahead and\n\n338\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.790\nget one started.\n\n339\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.010\nAnd it's like-\n&gt;&gt; I can remember when I worked for\n\n340\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:08.410\na company that we would have a work bench,\nsimilar to what we have here and\n\n341\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.550\nyou just kind of wind them up and\ngo through the line and\n\n342\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.840\neven back in XP days when it was\na little more interactive there and so\n\n343\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.260\nyeah, multitasking,\nmaking the best of your time management.\n\n344\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.551\nThere you go Ronnie.\n\n345\n00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo here it is.\n\n346\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.774\nWe're gonna select just a new template.\n\n347\n00:19:21.774 --> 00:19:25.498\nI wanna select the OS, I think this\nis 64-bit install, but if is not,\n\n348\n00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.790\nI can change it later on.\n\n349\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.951\nI'm not so worried about it.\n\n350\n00:19:27.951 --> 00:19:31.653\nFrom here this is gonna be my sent OS and\n\n351\n00:19:31.653 --> 00:19:35.936\nI'm just gonna change this to ITProTV, and\n\n352\n00:19:35.936 --> 00:19:40.466\nwe'll just make this\nour Linux test machine.\n\n353\n00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:45.926\nClick Next here.\n\n354\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.890\nI'm going to select the ISO.\n\n355\n00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.780\nSo you'll see that if I don't talk through\nthis whole thing, it actually goes fairly\n\n356\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.635\nquickly, if I can find the correct ISO\nhere which I need to be able to find.\n\n357\n00:20:01.215 --> 00:20:04.215\nThere it is, I was gonna say Next\nwhere I choose the right one.\n\n358\n00:20:04.215 --> 00:20:06.975\nSo there is one that says minimal and\nthat's what I was looking for,\n\n359\n00:20:06.975 --> 00:20:08.265\nit took me a little bit of time.\n\n360\n00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:11.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I didn't wear on my glasses either\nso I hope you don't rely on me for that.\n\n361\n00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:14.455\n&gt;&gt; Nope, and of course we're just\nkind of doing the same thing.\n\n362\n00:20:14.455 --> 00:20:17.301\nThis one requires about a gig of RAM,\nso I didn't have to set that up\n\n363\n00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:25.063\nSelect Storage, this time instead of 32\ngigs, which I can change or what it said,\n\n364\n00:20:25.063 --> 00:20:28.823\nnotice that here's the template\nputting itself in place, saying hey,\n\n365\n00:20:28.823 --> 00:20:30.977\nthis can take about 8 gigs which is fine,\n\n366\n00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:34.950\nwe're not doing anything else with\nthis thing, except for building it up.\n\n367\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.034\nWe're going to put it\non the same network 0,\n\n368\n00:20:38.034 --> 00:20:40.169\ncuz I haven't created any\nother networks right now.\n\n369\n00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:45.930\nClick Next, and there it is,\nI've started my second one.\n\n370\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.170\nAnd in a moment, you'll see over here on\nthe left-hand side, it will pop up being\n\n371\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.800\nmy ITPRO.TV Linux test machine is what\nwe'll also end up seeing here too.\n\n372\n00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.710\nSo there goes.\n\n373\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.560\nIt's provisioning at this point and you\nsee a little yellow arrow as it's kind of\n\n374\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.100\ndoing it's thing in trying to get\neverything ready for it to run.\n\n375\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.600\nSo while that's working itself out,\n\n376\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.540\nlet's go back over to our Windows\nmachine and see if I'm ready, yep.\n\n377\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.320\nSo inside the console here,\nwe'll kind of see that now it's ready for\n\n378\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.740\nthe install portion, right?\n\n379\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.610\nNow notice something.\n\n380\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.550\nI don't know if you can\nsee it on the screen or\n\n381\n00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:30.055\nnot, you can kinda see that the mouse is\nhaving just a little bit of a hard time\n\n382\n00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:33.835\nkeeping up with where I'm actually\nplacing the cursor, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.275\nSometimes you actually see it's\nnot exactly the same place, so\n\n384\n00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:39.565\nI moved over here on the white bar,\nover on the right-hand side,\n\n385\n00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:43.275\nnotice that the cursor is no longer\nfollowing, and now here it is,\n\n386\n00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:48.340\nit's barely following, I'm gonna click\nNext, here and select Install now.\n\n387\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.900\nAnd now it's gonna begin of course\nthe process of installing and\n\n388\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.368\nsetting up what it needs to for\nthis process.\n\n389\n00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:59.330\nNow this particular process,\nkinda the hardest part of course,\n\n390\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.620\nis the beginning in\nchoosing what you want.\n\n391\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.790\nYou can also see where it's getting\na little bit grainy in what you're seeing\n\n392\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.490\nhere and that's because there really\nisn't a strong graphics card for this.\n\n393\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.440\nAt the very beginning,\n\n394\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.810\nyou just have to kind of suffer\nwith what you see a little bit.\n\n395\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.762\nI'm just gonna do the standard evaluation,\n\n396\n00:22:18.762 --> 00:22:23.650\nselect Next here, and\nI'm hoping that I clicked on it.\n\n397\n00:22:25.854 --> 00:22:28.129\nAccept the end user licensing agreement.\n\n398\n00:22:30.312 --> 00:22:34.640\nDo the custom install telling\nit to wipe everything clean.\n\n399\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.600\nSelect Next,\nat this point we can leave this one alone.\n\n400\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah everything looks like it really\nwould look during a normal installation at\n\n401\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.920\nthis point moving forward, right?\n\n402\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.510\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n403\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.540\nSo this is kind of the basics as\nwe're starting to get it in there.\n\n404\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.170\nThen let me come back over\nhere to the Linux machine\n\n405\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.940\ncuz this one's a little bit more hefty.\n\n406\n00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.796\nNow before we do this,\nlet's full screen this for a moment so\n\n407\n00:22:55.796 --> 00:22:57.423\nthat we can see a couple of things.\n\n408\n00:22:57.423 --> 00:23:02.540\nNotice that down here on the bottom,\nthere's a couple of buttons, right?\n\n409\n00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.894\nSend Ctrl-Alt-Del.\n\n410\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.680\nAlso I can undock this.\n\n411\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.940\nIn other words, it doesn't have\nto be locked in that one screen.\n\n412\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.380\nI can also do a full\nscreen if I choose to.\n\n413\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:19.440\nSo if I select let's say for example, this\nUndock here, it brings this up to now,\n\n414\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.400\nwhere I can move the whole thing\nover just a little bit, but\n\n415\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.800\nit's not really scaling right?\n\n416\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.080\nIt's actually just kind of leaving it\nin that size, and that's fine, but\n\n417\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.552\nthis one's saying, hey, look at that.\n\n418\n00:23:29.552 --> 00:23:32.991\nYou actually found a disk and\nnow I can click OK.\n\n419\n00:23:32.991 --> 00:23:34.833\nAnd now it's beginning,\n\n420\n00:23:34.833 --> 00:23:39.446\nit's done check here which is what\nI didn't want to do of course.\n\n421\n00:23:41.663 --> 00:23:43.312\nSo now,\nit's actually gonna check the disk.\n\n422\n00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:45.138\nRemember that when I said\nalso in the previous-\n\n423\n00:23:45.138 --> 00:23:45.939\n&gt;&gt; For the hash value?\n\n424\n00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:48.428\n&gt;&gt; Yep, for\nthe previous value here, right.\n\n425\n00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:53.393\nIf your using this inside of a production\nenvironment, right, you want to make\n\n426\n00:23:53.393 --> 00:23:57.632\nsure that you do run a test like this and\nverify everything is there.\n\n427\n00:23:57.632 --> 00:24:01.178\nI accidentally clicked on it is what\nwe actually ended up seeing here.\n\n428\n00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:02.771\nBut once it actually gets done,\n\n429\n00:24:02.771 --> 00:24:05.900\nthere's still a lot to do as\nfar as a Linux install goes.\n\n430\n00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.240\nYou have to decide on time,\ndate, user name.\n\n431\n00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.970\nThere's so much more to do here\nin terms of the basic install.\n\n432\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.090\nBut we're close, but\n\n433\n00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:19.020\nwe're not actually close to being done\non this particular install so far.\n\n434\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.790\nSo let's switch on over and\nsee if, I'd be surprised, well,\n\n435\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.390\nlet's check out the Windows install,\nsee how close we are.\n\n436\n00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.900\nSo the great thing is the files\nhave actually been copied.\n\n437\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.399\nIt's getting ready for\nthe installation, it's very blurry.\n\n438\n00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:41.876\nIt says about 15% of getting those file\nready to do, so there is a lot of this.\n\n439\n00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:46.293\nBut the great things is, through the magic\nof television, what we should be able to\n\n440\n00:24:46.293 --> 00:24:50.600\ndo now is kind of sit back and allow\nthe rest of this process to go through.\n\n441\n00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.950\nAnd also for the Linux machine,\n\n442\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.250\nthere's just a few answers, but that way\nwe'll kind of time everything right,\n\n443\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.420\nand we'll be able to end this show\nwith a complete installation.\n\n444\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.450\nBut for right now,\nlet's go ahead and do that,\n\n445\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.230\nand we'll make the magic of\ntelevision happen right now.\n\n446\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.770\nAnd you'll just see it as it\nactually comes up at the very end.\n\n447\n00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.880\nAll right, so there we are,\nhopefully it didn't take you too long.\n\n448\n00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.890\nIt took us a little bit longer time\nto get to the point where we are.\n\n449\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.600\nAnd that Windows actually did go through a\ncouple of reboots as it got to this point.\n\n450\n00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.380\nBut now I simply have to just add in,\n\n451\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.940\nif I can type here,\nthe password that I'm going to use.\n\n452\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.560\nAnd this is all very tiny when\nyou're working on a laptop.\n\n453\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.570\nSo just take a little bit a time here.\n\n454\n00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.100\nAnd it's finalizing the settings, and\n\n455\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.760\nwe should be up and\nready to go in just a moment.\n\n456\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.440\nNow, there's a couple of other things\nwe have to do before we get the full,\n\n457\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.440\nworking into Zen Server here,\nof this VM, but I can now log in.\n\n458\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.610\nI can select the send Ctrl+Alt+Del.\n\n459\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.328\nAnd, as the administrator,\nI enter in my password.\n\n460\n00:25:57.524 --> 00:26:01.020\nAnd, from this point,\nit's now gonna build my profile, okay?\n\n461\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:07.220\nThe last step that we need to do when we\nstart installing the operating system,\n\n462\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.920\ngetting everything done, is we need\nto wait for the profile to come up.\n\n463\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.180\nAnd, once everything is done there,\nwe need to install what we call our\n\n464\n00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.060\nguest tools inside of that VM server,\nokay.\n\n465\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.850\nThat VM that we've just created.\n\n466\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.740\nLet me click back on the General tab for\na moment.\n\n467\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.714\nAnd let me show you\na couple of things here.\n\n468\n00:26:26.714 --> 00:26:33.731\nNotice that the virtualization state,\nwhatever I state, virtual station.\n\n469\n00:26:33.731 --> 00:26:38.440\nVirtualization state,\nright now it says IO not optimized.\n\n470\n00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.250\nThat means the input\noutput is not optimized.\n\n471\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.660\nManagement agent is not installed.\n\n472\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.270\nNot able to receive updates\nfrom Windows Updates, okay.\n\n473\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:53.310\nSo now it says install IO and\nmanagement agent is what we want to do.\n\n474\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.770\nThis is what used to be called Zen Tools.\n\n475\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.130\nNow today they call it something\na little bit different.\n\n476\n00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.043\nWhich is gonna be the guest tools,\nis what they call it, as well.\n\n477\n00:27:02.043 --> 00:27:03.875\nAnd that's what we have to do.\n\n478\n00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:05.496\nYou do not want a machine,\n\n479\n00:27:05.496 --> 00:27:10.290\na VM, on your network without having\nthis information, because this is what\n\n480\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:15.180\nreally allows Zen Server to get\nsome information back from the VM.\n\n481\n00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:22.120\nFor example, now in the memory, I can edit\nthe amount of memory that we can use.\n\n482\n00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.850\nI can also click on the storage and\nadd in other information.\n\n483\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.220\nBut there's also networking,\nconsult, all these and\n\n484\n00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.700\nperformance is kind of the key here.\n\n485\n00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.200\nI get a little bit of information,\nbut not a lot.\n\n486\n00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.378\nBut once we actually\nadd in those Zen Tools,\n\n487\n00:27:40.378 --> 00:27:45.118\na lot of that will integrate better in\nwith Zen Center and Zen Server itself.\n\n488\n00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.343\nAnd that's what we need to be able to do.\n\n489\n00:27:47.343 --> 00:27:51.910\nThe way that we add in those additional\ntools is we click on Console, and\n\n490\n00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.198\ni'm hoping that everything\ngot plugged in there.\n\n491\n00:27:55.198 --> 00:27:58.183\nI'm gonna click on the network right now.\n\n492\n00:27:58.183 --> 00:28:02.083\nThe other thing that it will also help\nus do is to match up the way that my\n\n493\n00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:06.560\nmouse is moving, and it's not gonna\nhave to try and keep up here.\n\n494\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.820\nBut right here across the top\nwhere it says DVD Drive,\n\n495\n00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.410\nthis is a virtual DVD drive that\nnow is accessible inside of the VM.\n\n496\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.240\nIf I click on this drop down and\nI come down to the bottom where it\n\n497\n00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.900\nsays guest-tools,\nthat's objective first apparently.\n\n498\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.372\nAnd now notice that you wanna make sure\nthat that says that, guest-tools.iso.\n\n499\n00:28:33.372 --> 00:28:36.628\nOnce we have that available,\nthat little blue box,\n\n500\n00:28:36.628 --> 00:28:41.661\nwe'll kind of click up there and we'll\njust run the actual setup to make it work.\n\n501\n00:28:48.471 --> 00:28:51.342\nAnd once that actually\nfinishes setting up,\n\n502\n00:28:51.342 --> 00:28:55.430\nwe should now have an optimized VM for\nour virtual environment.\n\n503\n00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.560\nAnd it's gonna require a restart for\nthat to happen.\n\n504\n00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.970\nOnce that thing gets restarted and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n505\n00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.665\nNow, let's check on the Linux machine just\nfor a moment, just to see if it's done,\n\n506\n00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:09.920\nbut we'll take care of that\na little bit later too.\n\n507\n00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.420\nLet me reattatch to console so\nwe can see it.\n\n508\n00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.840\nThere it is.\nIt's finishing up its installation\n\n509\n00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.910\nas well.\n\n510\n00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.294\nBut at this point,\n\n511\n00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:22.060\nwe are just a moment away from\nseeing if everything is optimized.\n\n512\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.170\nBut the great thing is, if it's all done,\nwe don't even have to wait for\n\n513\n00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.480\nthe finish up the reboot and everything.\n\n514\n00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.130\nAll I have to do is click\non the General tab and\n\n515\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.050\nin a moment,\nhopefully everything will refresh.\n\n516\n00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.350\nLet me kind of collapse it up here,\nand so we're just waiting on.\n\n517\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.790\nSo, hopefully here it goes.\n\n518\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.979\nOkay, I was hoping that\nit would boot up by now.\n\n519\n00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:47.844\nBut as everything is booting up,\nnow in a moment we should see inside of\n\n520\n00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:53.047\nthe General tab here that that\nvirtualization state will end up changing.\n\n521\n00:29:53.047 --> 00:29:55.820\n&gt;&gt; If I can ever get it\nto actually come back up.\n\n522\n00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.740\nNow, the other thing that you\nmay also find out in seven or\n\n523\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.740\nnot, sometimes if you would have left\nan operating system or the guest tools\n\n524\n00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.350\ninstalled on the DVD drive, your\nvirtual machine wouldn't boot back up.\n\n525\n00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.670\nSo one of the best practices\nof course is always eject.\n\n526\n00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.050\nMake sure that it's empty as well.\n\n527\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:16.870\nAnd, that should do it.\n\n528\n00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.630\nBut, now notice, hey there we go,\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n529\n00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.660\nNow notice that this is now IO optimized,\nmanagement agent is installed.\n\n530\n00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.995\nBut, at this point, it is not able\nto receive updates for processing.\n\n531\n00:30:28.995 --> 00:30:30.835\nRonnie, why is it not\nable to receive updates?\n\n532\n00:30:30.835 --> 00:30:31.920\nI'm running an eval copy,\n\n533\n00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.670\nthat's pretty much why that you\nare actually seeing that now too.\n\n534\n00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.450\nBut just kinda realize this\nis a big part of it, okay?\n\n535\n00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:44.432\nSo installing a VM, a little bit more\nthan what you might have thought about.\n\n536\n00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:48.150\nBut overall though, the install\nprocess is kind of the same thing.\n\n537\n00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.400\nThe only real edition that we're adding in\nis making it work better with ZEN Server\n\n538\n00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.750\nby using the guest tools and doing that.\n\n539\n00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:01.260\nBut that's a great place for\nus to really kind of finish up this show.\n\n540\n00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.280\nWe know that we have to install\nit inside of Linux, but\n\n541\n00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.840\nwe'll kind of hold off on and\n\n542\n00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.600\nsee the finish of that product as well and\nthen we'll install in a later episode too.\n\n543\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.181\n&gt;&gt; You gave us a good head start here.\n\n544\n00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:12.502\nWe've already got a couple\nof machines going,\n\n545\n00:31:12.502 --> 00:31:15.820\nwe've installed the guest tools\non the Windows operating system.\n\n546\n00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.698\nBut in order for these virtual\nmachines to really be functional,\n\n547\n00:31:18.698 --> 00:31:20.018\nthere's more to configure.\n\n548\n00:31:20.018 --> 00:31:23.864\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, don't go\nanywhere, we have more information headed\n\n549\n00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:27.340\nyour way, but for this show we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n550\n00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.470\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n551\n00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.120\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n552\n00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.376\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:12.018\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:14.863\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, to our Citrix XenServer show.\n\n6\n00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:17.058\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:21.240\nIn the previous episodes we were looking\nat how to configure your Virtual Machines.\n\n8\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180\nBut what if your organization needs\na more customized approach, or\n\n9\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.410\nperhaps your organization's needs\nevolve over time like they often do?\n\n10\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.520\nWell in this show,\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.040\nwe'll provide you with some tools to\nbe able to accomplish these tasks.\n\n12\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.640\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studio.\n\n13\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.970\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.810\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back as we\ncontinue to move forward through learning\n\n15\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.560\na little more bit more about Zen Server\nand using it as a virtualization tool.\n\n16\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.200\nThat we really want inside\nin our organizations.\n\n17\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.480\nAnd today, we are taking a look at\nsome of the different things we can do\n\n18\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500\nto make sure out virtual machines\nfit exactly the way we need to.\n\n19\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.620\nBecause you not realize Cherokee, after\nwhile, we can build a virtual machine, but\n\n20\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.980\nit might be, let's say a month later or\ntwo months later.\n\n21\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.230\nWe might have fount out that the\nperformance is not as good as it is, and\n\n22\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.070\nwe need to change a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.380\nWell it used to be kinda difficult to do\nso, to be able to do anything about it,\n\n24\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.060\nbut now with the virtualization\ntechnologies gotten easier.\n\n25\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.520\nBut you may not have actually done it\ninside of a Zen server before, and that's\n\n26\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.330\nwhat we gonna take a look out and help us\nout as we move forth through this process.\n\n27\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.070\nSo we wanna jump in to make sure that\nwe understand what's going on, right?\n\n28\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.430\nWe've talked about setting up some\nstorage devices, as well as for\n\n29\n00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.060\nour shared storage devices.\n\n30\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.150\nBut before we do that, we definitely need\nto focus in on the virtual machines,\n\n31\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.070\nthat's why we wanna come\nhere to take a look, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.470\nNow let's go through some principles and\nhere it is.\n\n33\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440\nWe're inside of our XenServer.\n\n34\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.370\nAnd I've got, or our XenCenter, I'm gonna\nget those two terms confused today,\n\n35\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.510\nI can feel it in my head already.\n\n36\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.700\nXenCenter and notice I have\nmy XENSRV 01 and my XENSRV02.\n\n37\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.750\nWhen we start to configure and\nchange things for VMs,\n\n38\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.430\nthere are a couple of I guess good\nprinciples for us to understand, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.360\nSometimes, there are things you\ncan change while on the fly.\n\n40\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.810\nI'm trying to think of one right now, but\nI really can't for one reason or another.\n\n41\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.790\nBut there are sometimes where things you\ncan change in the virtual machine doesn't\n\n42\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.850\nreally matter, but most of the things that\nyou might wanna change such as the number\n\n43\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.760\nof CPUs that the VM has access to,\nthe amount of RAM.\n\n44\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.460\nThe addition of an additional hard drive\ninto the device, you may find out that\n\n45\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.420\ntrying to add those on the fly while they\nare on may not work the way you want too.\n\n46\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.260\nAt the very minimum, right,\nthey might not show up, better yet work.\n\n47\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.050\nIf you want to add in\nanother network adapter.\n\n48\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.070\nWhatever it might be, you have to\nmake sure that what you do of course\n\n49\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.810\nis that you have to know how to do this.\n\n50\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.740\nSo one of the key things that I like\nto do, if it's possible, right?\n\n51\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.600\nIn this environment, is to make sure that\nwe shut down the virtual machine, and\n\n52\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.550\nonce we shut down the virtual machine\nthen we can modify and configure it.\n\n53\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.950\nSo if you're not sure in a virtual\nenvironment whether or not it will work\n\n54\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.840\nand go it doesn't give me the option the\ngreat thing is it will kind of tell you.\n\n55\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.476\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n56\n00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:13.050\nSo here on XENSRV01 I wanna add and\n\n57\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.400\nshut down two virtual machines that\nwe had created on a previous episode.\n\n58\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.120\nOn XENSVR02 these were things that I\nhad done outside of our regular show,\n\n59\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.240\nto make sure they are running and\nthey are still up and running.\n\n60\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.160\nSo if I am not sure whether or\nnot I can change something.\n\n61\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.830\nSo I'm gonna use this CentOS minimal\ninstall to see a few different things\n\n62\n00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.870\nover on the right hand side\ninside of the details.\n\n63\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.650\nLet's take for example we wanted to add in\nadditional memory to this Zen server or\n\n64\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.990\nto this Citrix OS server.\n\n65\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.150\nIf I click on memory well,\n\n66\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.260\nit seems to show me that I might\nhave the ability to do so.\n\n67\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.130\nNotice that over on the right hand side,\nthere is this Edit button.\n\n68\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.410\nCurrently, it says here's the minimal\namount of memory that I have and\n\n69\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.130\nit says maximum amount\nright now is one gig.\n\n70\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.450\nIf I go ahead and click on Edit,\nnow notice it says,\n\n71\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.430\nhey, you might be able\nto change this here.\n\n72\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.288\nWell let's see if we can do\nsomething like this, if I wanted to.\n\n73\n00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:15.878\nLet's say I wanted to change\nit up to 2 gigs instead.\n\n74\n00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:17.870\n048, we can do that.\n\n75\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.110\nNow because I'm zoomed in a little bit,\nmy mouse kinda locks up there,\n\n76\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.250\ncuz I'm inside of that VM environment.\n\n77\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.400\nI just have to kinda unlock that.\n\n78\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.865\nNow notice we can do something like this.\n\n79\n00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:32.150\nNow this one of those we have to pay\nattention just a little bit more as well\n\n80\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.880\nin terms of memory.\n\n81\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.570\nSome of us might have gone through,\nwhen we first set up the VM Cherokee,\n\n82\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.370\nwhere we just accepted some of\nthe defaults of the template.\n\n83\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.280\nAnd one of those unusual defaults of\nthe templates sometime is that they might\n\n84\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.780\nchoose this Automatically allocate\nmemory within this range.\n\n85\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.270\nAnd this is what we call\ndynamic memory allocation.\n\n86\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.530\nDynamic memory allocation, it works.\n\n87\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.860\nOkay, but lets make sure that we\nunderstand what that means, right?\n\n88\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.240\nIt means that even though I say that I'm\ngonna assign two gigs of memory to this.\n\n89\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.900\nIt's not gonna use all two gigs and\nclaim it for my virtual machine.\n\n90\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.360\nWhat it really means is I'll use\nup to two gigs if I need to.\n\n91\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.780\nBut, if I'm not using it,\n\n92\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.520\nI'll allow it to actually be used\nin the general pool of memory.\n\n93\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.470\nAnd that sounds great\nbecause that sounds like hey,\n\n94\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.440\nthat's efficient usage of the memory.\n\n95\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.090\nThat is good utilization of the memory.\n\n96\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.170\nAnd inside of a testing environment,\nit works awesome, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.820\nInside of a production environment, that's\nprobably not something you want to do.\n\n98\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.070\nNow just when I say that, there\nare virtualization environment out there,\n\n99\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.830\nI know that Hyper-V says,\n\n100\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.500\nno this is perfectly fine to use\ninside of a production environment.\n\n101\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.330\nBut I have experienced issues with this\nwhere it's actually been on machine which\n\n102\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.618\nthe amount of RAM on the physical host\nitself that was trying to allocate from.\n\n103\n00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:58.100\nThat because it was dynamically allocated,\nonce machine ended up taking, well,\n\n104\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.530\nlet's say three machines end up taking so\nmuch memory.\n\n105\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.230\nThat when this one machine was\nallocated whatever to two gigs were\n\n106\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.910\nit didn't have enough to actually go and\nclaim two gigs when it needed to.\n\n107\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.070\nSo this particular VM\nslowed down very much so.\n\n108\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.460\nSo if you're actually doing this in a\nproduction environment, my recommendation,\n\n109\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.760\nand you don't have to take\nit if you don't want to.\n\n110\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.210\nIs to make sure that you go ahead and\njust set that fixed to memory for you.\n\n111\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.660\nSo that way you don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n112\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.650\nOnce you do that,\nit will claim that two gigs and\n\n113\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.810\nthat means that you won't be able to\nuse it for anybody else's machine.\n\n114\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.510\nThat's always a good thing because if\nthis machine really does need two gigs,\n\n115\n00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.020\nyou need to assign it and\nleave it that way.\n\n116\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.470\nCuz that is how physical\nservers are anyways, and\n\n117\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.100\nwants to be as close to that\nenvironment as possible.\n\n118\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.590\nSo you might wanna do that.\n\n119\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.700\nBut right now though, you can see where\nthis one in the template it did set it for\n\n120\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.250\na fix amount of memory.\n\n121\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.140\nBut if I want to change it,\nit's as easy as selecting it right here.\n\n122\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.540\nNow if your virtual machine doesn't\nsupport this the ability to change it on\n\n123\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.260\nthe fly, well then you won't have\nthese options available to you.\n\n124\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.720\nSo, then you can set that.\n\n125\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.350\nNow, here,\nif you choose to use the dynamic memory,\n\n126\n00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.010\nremember the amount the minimum memory,\nand then the maximum amount,\n\n127\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.380\nyou want to set that range,\nis what you want to be able to do.\n\n128\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.320\nSo let's take for an example in the Citrix\nOS here, that the minimum amount is 256.\n\n129\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.060\nAnd then the max amount here I'm gonna\nsay 2048 is what I'm going to do.\n\n130\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.700\nWell now notice it will give me that\nability to changed this up to where I can\n\n131\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.010\nsee where it's saying, look I'll set the\nrange and this one even changed it for me.\n\n132\n00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.120\nIt didn't like the fact that I chose 256.\n\n133\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.500\nSo let's do between 512 and two gigs\ninstead, if we wanted to assign that.\n\n134\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.150\nSo you can change that right there.\n\n135\n00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.880\nI'm going to set it back up here to the\nfixed memory instead and then click OK.\n\n136\n00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.081\nChanging the max amount of memory\nwill cause this VM to be rebooted.\n\n137\n00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:59.908\nThis is why it is actually very important,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:04.459\nIf this machine were a critical\nVM inside of your infrastructure,\n\n139\n00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:08.014\nyou've gotta realize what this means-\n&gt;&gt; Plan for this.\n\n140\n00:08:08.014 --> 00:08:08.583\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:13.624\nSo it's not something that you'd\nwant to do during production hours.\n\n142\n00:08:13.624 --> 00:08:16.640\nYou don't want to do this during\nthe busiest time of the day.\n\n143\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.930\nIt's just letting you know,\nwe'll let you do it.\n\n144\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.320\nBut if you do,\nremember before we can actually accept\n\n145\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.320\nthe amount of memory you're\nnow allocating this thing.\n\n146\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.910\nIt has to reboot so\nthat the VM can recognize it and\n\n147\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.200\nthe operating system can recognize\nthat you've added RAM in.\n\n148\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.270\nAnd the reality of it is\nthat the operating system,\n\n149\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.200\neven on a physical machine, right,\nit wouldn't normally let you do it anyway.\n\n150\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.910\nSo, it's really saying that what\nyou probably should do instead\n\n151\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.630\nis shut the machine down first,\nadd your memory back in, and get it up and\n\n152\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.800\ngoing before you do that.\n\n153\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.310\nNow, this does lead you to a conundrum\nespecially in terms of production.\n\n154\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.650\nIt means that you should\nthink about this beforehand.\n\n155\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.990\nWhen is there time that you can do this?\n\n156\n00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.640\nOr you should have a redundancy in place.\n\n157\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.200\nSo that way you don't actually miss\nany services that are going on.\n\n158\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.610\nBut just remember on something like\nthat where you can do that as well.\n\n159\n00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.220\nNow, if I go up here to Zen Server 01, and\n\n160\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.910\nnow on this Linux test machine,\nI select the memory option here.\n\n161\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.710\nNotice that no memory\nis assigned right now.\n\n162\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.721\nIt's cuz the machine's off,\nit's saying I'm not taking up any memory.\n\n163\n00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.789\nYes, from here I can click edit and\nnow I can set that fixed amount or\n\n164\n00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:31.415\neven allocate the amount\nthat I want to do.\n\n165\n00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:35.853\nAnd we can do that, let's say that we'll\nset this one all the way up to 2048,\n\n166\n00:09:35.853 --> 00:09:38.267\nclick OK, and notice it didn't balk at me,\n\n167\n00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:43.080\nit didn't say, you just changed this\nmemory amount, it's because, it's off!\n\n168\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.410\nIt says, of course you can change\nthe memory amount of what you can do.\n\n169\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.830\nBut just be aware that you may\nfind some issues if you try and\n\n170\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.980\ndo it on the fly when you\nstart to take a look.\n\n171\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.760\nSo memory's one of the important options,\nespecially in the VM,\n\n172\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.150\nas far as resources go.\n\n173\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.960\nMemory, and\nthen of course CPU utilization,\n\n174\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.030\nwhich we'll get to in a moment as well.\n\n175\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.710\nSo just realize that you do have\na lot of considerations that you need\n\n176\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.700\nto take in hand when you do this.\n\n177\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.370\nThe next one that we also want to\ntalk about, and I skipped right over,\n\n178\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.300\nI don’t know why,\nmemory is the first one I normally go to.\n\n179\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.450\nI skipped over this General tab and\nyou can see that in the General tab,\n\n180\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.970\nit tells you just a little\nbit more information.\n\n181\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.250\nAnd what we are looking for\nCPU utilization, right here.\n\n182\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.460\nThat’s one I didn’t want to skip,\nbut I did.\n\n183\n00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.710\nSo when we start taking\na look at the ideas of CPUs,\n\n184\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.580\nwell it really does depend on the number\nof cores that you have on your servers.\n\n185\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.050\nMost of the servers today,\nif you buy them right?\n\n186\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.510\nIf they're Xeon processors,\n\n187\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.900\nthey're actually gonna come with two\ndifferent sockets and then multiple cores.\n\n188\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.480\nVery difficult,\nI don't want to say difficult.\n\n189\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.940\nVery rarely, do you find someone\nordering a server that says Yeah,\n\n190\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.590\nwe're just going to depend on one CPU.\n\n191\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.970\nCan it happen?\n\n192\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.732\nDefinitely.\n\n193\n00:10:55.732 --> 00:10:58.290\nInside of my testing environment,\nis that what I'm doing right now?\n\n194\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.030\nYes.\n\n195\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.690\nBut overall, though, if you really did\ndo this for your production environment.\n\n196\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.960\nYou wanna make sure, of course,\n\n197\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.110\nthat you do have multiple,\nsockets going on there for your machine.\n\n198\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.490\nSo how do we change this?\n\n199\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.280\nWell, we simply click on properties.\n\n200\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.654\nAnd then inside of properties, we come up,\nof course, with this Properties window\n\n201\n00:11:20.654 --> 00:11:25.817\nthat will now allow us to go down here on\nthe left hand side of the navigation tree.\n\n202\n00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:31.630\nCan add in custom fields but what I\nwant is right here in the CPU available.\n\n203\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.580\nRemember that, the CPU represents\nthe physical CPUs, right here,\n\n204\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.115\nthat's available to this machine.\n\n205\n00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:41.530\nAnd we had two of them, then you'd\nactually see, well, two CPUs here.\n\n206\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.456\nAnd now it is also saying,\n\n207\n00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:46.160\nhey the number of CPUs that you are gonna\nassign to this virtual machine.\n\n208\n00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.910\nBecause the virtual environment,\nit says VCPU instead.\n\n209\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.580\nNow even though this is, I think it is,\nit's a quad core processor.\n\n210\n00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.220\nNotice that it gives me the ability to\ngo beyond the number of processors that\n\n211\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.450\nare actually, or the number of CPUs, CPU\ncores that it finds in the physical host.\n\n212\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.095\nSo that means,\nI can over-allocate if I want to.\n\n213\n00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:12.900\nOver-allocation is never a good thing,\ncan you do it?\n\n214\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.490\nYes, so if you have a quad-core processor,\n\n215\n00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.590\ncan you send that there to eight,\nif you want to.\n\n216\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.340\nIn theory yes, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.633\nBut in reality it may hurt\nthe performance of your virtual machine.\n\n218\n00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:30.289\nSo just remember that the best practice\nhere too, is to ensure that you never\n\n219\n00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:35.910\nset up more than the number of physical\nprocessors that you have available.\n\n220\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Well that's pretty interesting,\nif you think about Ronnie.\n\n221\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.710\nWe really don't wanna overallocate.\n\n222\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.470\nIf we think about our original hardware,\nthat's what we're working with here.\n\n223\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.280\nBut you do see some improvements\nover the years with\n\n224\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.930\ndifferent virtualization options, just you\nwere looking at memory a few moments ago.\n\n225\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.910\nAnd I don't know if you never\nhad an unexpected restart,\n\n226\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.960\nit happens in production environments.\n\n227\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.580\nBut sometimes, if that machine,\nif you're sharing that memory out.\n\n228\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.290\nAnd that machine is drawing more during\nthat reboot, what if that machine can't\n\n229\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.360\nreboot again, because there is\nno enough available memory?\n\n230\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.338\nAnd so there are technics that\ndifferent companies are working on,\n\n231\n00:13:09.338 --> 00:13:13.803\nsuch as Microsoft has their smart paging\nthat pulls a little bit from the hard\n\n232\n00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:18.575\ndrive to kinda of rob Peter to pay Paul,\nso to speak, during the reboot process.\n\n233\n00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:21.945\nBut I wonder if they're gonna be working\non something like that in the future for\n\n234\n00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:23.619\nCPU to kinda set that threshold there.\n\n235\n00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:27.651\n&gt;&gt; More than likely, you never know\nexactly which way the industry is going,\n\n236\n00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:31.427\nbut as they see more virtualization\ncoming on hand, they'll try do as\n\n237\n00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:35.204\nmuch as they can do of course to\nsupport the virtualization standard.\n\n238\n00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:37.609\nBecause that's just the way\nthat people wanna pay for,\n\n239\n00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.374\nthey want better virtualization,\nthey want the ability do it,\n\n240\n00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:42.980\nbut still work like\na regular physical machine.\n\n241\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.000\nSo don't count it out in the future\nis what we want to do here.\n\n242\n00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.010\nBut if I wanted to reassign,\nI could go ahead and change right here.\n\n243\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.050\nSo I can give it a number of CPUs\nthen I can assign a priority.\n\n244\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.535\nNow this idea of the priority doesn't\nreally mean much at this point\n\n245\n00:13:57.535 --> 00:14:02.650\ncuz I only have two, virtual machines and\nboth of them are off right now.\n\n246\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.120\nBut if you had multiple virtual machines,\nright?.\n\n247\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.290\nYou are actually saying,\nhey, the priority for\n\n248\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.020\nthis particular virtual machine in\ncomparison to the other ones as well, so\n\n249\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.730\nwhich one do you need to kind of\nreally have more power asign to it?\n\n250\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.180\nAnd which one can you kind of\nslow down if you really need to?\n\n251\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.370\nSo some of things you might do as\nyou go look at what's some highest\n\n252\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.280\npriority to me?\n\n253\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.257\nIs my email server, it's constantly up and\n\n254\n00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:31.284\ngoing if I'm still managing\nan on premises emails server.\n\n255\n00:14:31.284 --> 00:14:32.841\nSo something like that you might go,\n\n256\n00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:35.370\nthat's the one the needs\nmost processing power.\n\n257\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.732\nMake sure you give it all\nthe options that you need.\n\n258\n00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:40.320\n&gt;&gt; So,\nessentially I'm treeoging my network here.\n\n259\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Yup, you gonna have to.\n\n260\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.750\nAlso notice right here,\n\n261\n00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.610\nthere's a couple of different ones\nthat we have in terms of the Topology.\n\n262\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.930\nIt says that I can actually have two\nsockets with one core per socket or\n\n263\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.400\nI could do one socket with\ntwo core per socket instead.\n\n264\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.190\nSo this is just saying how is this going\nto be reported in the virtual machine.\n\n265\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:05.680\nDo you want it to show up let’s say for\nan example as a Xeon processor,\n\n266\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.790\nI always called it Zenon but I am\nincorrect on that, but Xeon right X-E-O-N.\n\n267\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.560\nThen you can say I want two sockets.\n\n268\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.190\nBut really, four dashes show up,\nyou know, as one core per socket.\n\n269\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.060\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n270\n00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.140\nIt doesn't matter for the virtual machine.\n\n271\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.890\nOr do I want a single multi processor\nthat has multiple cores in it?\n\n272\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.350\nIt really depends on\nthe environment that you're in.\n\n273\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.540\nSometimes some software may balk when\nit says, I see only one socket but\n\n274\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.460\nmultiple core,\nI don't wanna deal with that.\n\n275\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.220\nI would rather work with two sockets here.\n\n276\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.540\nCitrix center says, sure, of course we\ncan handle that and allow you to get.\n\n277\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can lie to your virtual machine\n\n278\n00:15:45.869 --> 00:15:47.420\nas it needs to.\n\n279\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.050\nThere's of course some other\noptions that we have available.\n\n280\n00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.518\nThe Boot Options, we're not gonna\nmess with the Boot Options right now.\n\n281\n00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.042\nWe don't have anything but\nthe boot device, right now.\n\n282\n00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:58.781\nWe haven't set up anything\nlike high availability,\n\n283\n00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:03.766\nbut this idea of start options and\nstart order is also very important for\n\n284\n00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:07.275\nsomething that we do once\nwe do set up clustering.\n\n285\n00:16:07.275 --> 00:16:13.556\nI can have it where, if the entire host\nfails because power outage lasted longer\n\n286\n00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:19.570\nthan my UPS is gonna have, but I want\nthe ability for the machines to boot up.\n\n287\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.984\nWell, right now it's kind of like\nall the machines can come up, and\n\n288\n00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:29.000\nif I tell them, restart automatically\nwhen the entire host reboots.\n\n289\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.110\nWell, which one may start up first is\nactually very important in terms of\n\n290\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.320\nthe sequencing.\n\n291\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.950\nFor example, let's use the email\nserver as an example here, right?\n\n292\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.780\nThe very fact is, if your email server\ncomes up before let's say your domain\n\n293\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.800\ncontroller, that can be a little\nbit hefty cuz it doesn't now\n\n294\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.390\nhave the ability to do all the things\nthat needs to do when it's looking for\n\n295\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.270\nthat domain controller to be up.\n\n296\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.250\nSo may prioritize the order in\nthe boot sequence of your VMs\n\n297\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.190\neven inside of Citrix Zen Server too.\n\n298\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.380\nSo there's a couple of different\noptions that we have available\n\n299\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.810\njust on that general tab.\n\n300\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.200\nBut the main one here of course\nis the CPU and then the memory.\n\n301\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.070\nAnd now we can go to\nthe idea of storage as well.\n\n302\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.530\nStorage, remember that\nsometimes you have this.\n\n303\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.207\nIf you accepted like what we did,\nthe default for\n\n304\n00:17:18.207 --> 00:17:21.177\nthis Citrix XenServer is 8 GB in size.\n\n305\n00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:25.950\nTo you and me, we would never think about\nputting a Windows Server machine on\n\n306\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.634\nan 8 GB hard drive, that would be silly,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:32.345\n&gt;&gt; But overall though, what can we do,\n\n308\n00:17:32.345 --> 00:17:38.480\nif we actually gonna realize something\nthat we ran out of hard drive space.\n\n309\n00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.970\nWell how do you replace that?\n\n310\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.610\nWell you can't.\n\n311\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.740\nBut can you add in additional hard drives?\n\n312\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.780\nNotice down here at the bottom,\nthere is the ability to not only add\n\n313\n00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.530\nin an additional hard drive, but let's say\nthat I wanna move a data storage drive,\n\n314\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.230\nmaybe from another\nmachine over to this one.\n\n315\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.300\nIf I have it as a file, which again is\none of the things that we can have as\n\n316\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.540\nsort of like a virtual hard disk drive,\nright?\n\n317\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.336\nI can just simply attach that\ndisk right here as well.\n\n318\n00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.582\nOnce again, these are things that you\nmight have to shut the machine down for\n\n319\n00:18:09.582 --> 00:18:10.959\ninstead, make sure it goes to.\n\n320\n00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie this is a feature that's\ngoing to be really useful when it comes to\n\n321\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:19.573\nany kind of migrations or decommissioning\na particular server because you're gonna\n\n322\n00:18:19.573 --> 00:18:23.432\nsee well, very very little down time\nif any if you're able to go ahead and\n\n323\n00:18:23.432 --> 00:18:25.410\nschedule it properly, right?\n\n324\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.710\n&gt;&gt; That's true, and\nthat what it's done for, right.\n\n325\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.400\nSo it makes it easier for\nus to be able to to that.\n\n326\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.340\nIf I need to add an additional storage I\ncan just create another storage device,\n\n327\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.160\na virtual storage device.\n\n328\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.190\nAttach it right in, ready to go, if one\nis existing because I am decommissioning\n\n329\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.350\nanother one but\nit still has valuable data on it,\n\n330\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.470\nI can attach it right into this\nvirtual machine very quickly too.\n\n331\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.700\nNow let's get to the idea of\nnetworking for right now.\n\n332\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.350\nNow, when you start seeing it\ninside of the virtual machine,\n\n333\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.670\nthe only thing that they have available\nto us right now is what we call,\n\n334\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.910\nof course, a virtual network interface.\n\n335\n00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.270\nNow this is the same as what\nwe'd call a virtual switch.\n\n336\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.970\nOn every host, if I click on zen\nserver to go back up the higher level.\n\n337\n00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.390\nNotice I have networking and\nI have NICs that are available.\n\n338\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:22.500\nNICs represent the number of physical NICs\nthat are actually on the host itself.\n\n339\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.593\nNetworking represents what we call\nV switches or virtual switches,\n\n340\n00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:31.310\nthat really represent different\nnetworks that we want to attach to.\n\n341\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.072\nSo, consider them as different switches\nthat you would attach them to,\n\n342\n00:19:35.072 --> 00:19:36.004\nto do something.\n\n343\n00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:40.339\nSo you might choose like Network 0 to here\nwhich is the one by default that I have\n\n344\n00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.861\nwhen it first got created.\n\n345\n00:19:41.861 --> 00:19:45.750\nWell this one I might attach\nout to the entire world but\n\n346\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.158\nI could have it where Network 1\ninstead when you start seeing\n\n347\n00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:53.840\nthe term Networking right here and\nNetwork.\n\n348\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.350\nI could have this only attached\nto internal VMs if I choose to.\n\n349\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.080\nThat way I'm separating out\ntwo different networks.\n\n350\n00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.620\nI could have it for a DMZ if I chose to or\n\n351\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.430\na testing environment, or\na development environment.\n\n352\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.640\nWhatever it might be,\nI can create my own virtual switch.\n\n353\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.110\nFrom that point, when I create new VMs,\nI go into my development environment,\n\n354\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.420\nI don't want them to get\nconnected out to the internet,\n\n355\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.880\nI attach them all to\nnetwork one if I want to.\n\n356\n00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.780\nAnd now they can see each other but,\n\n357\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.070\nthey won't actually get\nconnected out into the outside.\n\n358\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.300\nNow it's fairly simple,\nif I click on Add Network.\n\n359\n00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.370\nNow there's a couple of different\noptions that are available to us\n\n360\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.570\nthat we want to consider.\n\n361\n00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.640\nThe basic one that is first created when\nyou go ahead and just bring up XenServer.\n\n362\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.110\nIs, and you get into center.\n\n363\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.210\nIt's gonna be what we\ncall an external network.\n\n364\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:52.170\nIt creates a network that passes\ntraffic over one of your VLANs here.\n\n365\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.400\nWell the one that we actually just\ncare about, is the one that we're on.\n\n366\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.800\nSo this means we can be able to send\ntraffic outside, if we want to.\n\n367\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.790\nOutside of that VM,\noutside of that VM network.\n\n368\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.150\nAnd this allows us to get\nto the outside world.\n\n369\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.940\nI can have this single private network.\n\n370\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:13.690\nCreates a network that doesn't leave,\nthat does not leave each XenServer host.\n\n371\n00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.820\nSo, I can't connect to another\nVM that may be on XenServer two.\n\n372\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.510\nOkay, but I wanted to make sure that\nit's kind of localized in that one.\n\n373\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.625\nI could do that,\nthat gives me that ability to do so.\n\n374\n00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:28.159\nYou might do this, let's say,\nfor forensics, if you need it to,\n\n375\n00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:32.411\nwhere you had a VM that got infected with\nsomething and you wanted to isolate it.\n\n376\n00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:35.581\nYou wanna to make sure it didn't\ncommunicate outside of that one host, but\n\n377\n00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:39.080\nyou wanna be able to do that,\nyou might also do something like this.\n\n378\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.380\nYou of course can also have create\na network that bonds two NICs together and\n\n379\n00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.390\nwe are gonna talk about\ndoing that as well.\n\n380\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.510\nThe ability to say, take two NICs\nthat are, let's say 100 megabit NICs.\n\n381\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:51.520\nCombine them together, and\n\n382\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.620\nthey work as one, giving you a 200\nmegabit connection into your network.\n\n383\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.780\nNow with that one, if you choose something\nlike that, you have to be careful.\n\n384\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.190\nAnd it really depends on the switching\nthat you have available,\n\n385\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.750\nin your environment.\n\n386\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.300\nSome switches don't like the idea of\nseeing what they're gonna see here.\n\n387\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.010\nIf you bond both network\nadapters together,\n\n388\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.880\nit's gonna report as one Mac address.\n\n389\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.320\nAnd now something happens on the switch\nwhere it says, wait a minute.\n\n390\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.020\nHow is it that I have one Mac address\non two different ports on my switch?\n\n391\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.620\nAnd it may balk at it,\nokay is what you may end up seeing.\n\n392\n00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.010\nSo it really depends on the switching\nenvironment that you have set up.\n\n393\n00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.920\nBut the great thing is,\n\n394\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.840\nwhen we do what we call NIC bonding,\nwhich allows us to put it all together.\n\n395\n00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.950\nIf your switch will support,\nlet's say, LACP, I was\n\n396\n00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.710\ntrying to think, Link Aggregation Control\nProtocol, that's what I couldn't get past.\n\n397\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.480\nWell then you can set\nthat up on the switch.\n\n398\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.480\nAnd here inside of Zunzur and that will\nallow for the switch to recognize.\n\n399\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.320\nHey we know that both of those NICs\nreally belong to one machine and\n\n400\n00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.530\nwe're willing to let that happen as well.\n\n401\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.730\nSo there are different networks\nthat you can create and\n\n402\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.030\nthat helps to localize the type of\nnetwork connection that you'll do there.\n\n403\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.090\nLeaving it as the generic name here\nis probably not something great\n\n404\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.700\nthat you want to do.\n\n405\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.730\nIf I wanted to change the name\nI could click on Properties and\n\n406\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.530\nits here that I could give it, and\nlet’s say that this one is External1.\n\n407\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.890\nHere, alright, actually let’s kind of\nkeep with the naming convention that\n\n408\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:36.410\nI been doing here which\nis like ITPRO Tvdemo,\n\n409\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.720\nand we'll do this one for\nproduction, just as an example.\n\n410\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I did notice when you\nwere going over the different types of\n\n411\n00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.350\nswitches, our configurations that we had\navailable, we had internal, external,\n\n412\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.330\nand bonded.\n\n413\n00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.220\nSo, we've spoken about this a little bit.\n\n414\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.542\nIndustry terminology, sometimes they\nmay differ from one vendor to another.\n\n415\n00:23:55.542 --> 00:24:00.191\nSo for instance,\nlike Microsoft Kind of similar, but\n\n416\n00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:05.230\nthey have their private,\ninternal and external there.\n\n417\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.920\nI'm trying to say, but\nI think those are the correct ones.\n\n418\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.720\nBut, you see the terms different, but\n\n419\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.380\na lot of times it's the same technology\njust branded a little differently.\n\n420\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:20.199\n&gt;&gt; And to a point, this one is a little\nbit special in the way they say look you\n\n421\n00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:25.255\ncan create the bonded [CROSSTALK]\nnetwork adapter, which inside of hyperv,\n\n422\n00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:28.978\nI don't think they have a creation for\nthat right away.\n\n423\n00:24:28.978 --> 00:24:31.596\nThey might, for now-\n&gt;&gt; No, I think you're right, yeah.\n\n424\n00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:35.730\n&gt;&gt; But overall though, yeah it kinda works\nalong that same type of terminology.\n\n425\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.180\nYou gotta get use to a vendors\nway of describing things too.\n\n426\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.240\nNow remember we can name these things\ndescriptive and I recommend you do that.\n\n427\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Stick with their conventions.\n\n428\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, stick with something that makes\nit easy so when you build a VM and\n\n429\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.290\nyou want to attach a NIC to it.\n\n430\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.660\nAll you have to do is select your VM,\ngo to networking.\n\n431\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.150\nFrom that point,\nyou add your interface in and there it is.\n\n432\n00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.970\nProduction and I can click there.\n\n433\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.310\nAnd now, notice that this one added\nin to that one network for me.\n\n434\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.890\nNow I didn't need to do that,\nbut because it's already there.\n\n435\n00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.470\nBut that way it gives you some hint,\ninstead of going, that was network zero,\n\n436\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.460\nwhich connected to what?\n\n437\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.850\nMake sure you can see\nsomething like that as you\n\n438\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.080\ncontinue to go on there in terms\nof networking, but it's just one\n\n439\n00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.180\nof those things that you really have\nto make sure that it works out for you.\n\n440\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.030\nSo if this was a testing environment or\na development environment,\n\n441\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.600\nthat we are not connecting machines to\nenvironments that you don't need to.\n\n442\n00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.840\nWith the description and\nthe ability to change that up,\n\n443\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.580\nyou can choose and make sure it\ndoes exactly what you need as well.\n\n444\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.280\nNow those are pretty much kinda some of\nthe basic ones that we have available.\n\n445\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.880\nBut along with this, right, notice that\neach VM also has a couple of other\n\n446\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.530\nissues that we can, or I shouldn't\nsay issues, a couple other tabs here.\n\n447\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.100\nFor you to do direct management,\nyou have a direct console tab,\n\n448\n00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.290\nlet me go to the one that's on, here.\n\n449\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.400\nAnd if I click on console, that gives\nyou that ability to access the machine\n\n450\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.910\njust like you plugged the console\ncable directly into the machine.\n\n451\n00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.460\nIf I'm on side of Windows,\nI change that to console.\n\n452\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.780\nNotice it really does give me\nthe ability to sign in and\n\n453\n00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.820\nwork with this like it's\nactually the remote desktop.\n\n454\n00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.250\nAnd that's one of the features that\nthey added in, either version or\n\n455\n00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.780\na couple of versions ago.\n\n456\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.840\nWhere, instead I could say hey,\nchange this into remote desktop connection\n\n457\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.180\ninstead of doing this connection\nwindow console instead.\n\n458\n00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.540\nYou also have the ability to go into the\nperformance and monitor the performance\n\n459\n00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.440\nand this is why you might change one\nof those things they're talking about.\n\n460\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.980\nWhether it's the CPU, the RAM, the\nnetworking or even the disk utilization.\n\n461\n00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.470\nSo you can see like this one,\neven though I don't seem to be doing much.\n\n462\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.391\nIt tends to be spiking pretty good-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:47.705\n&gt;&gt; Every so often here and\n\n464\n00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:52.760\nthen the last one right over here,\nof course, is the ability to do snapshots.\n\n465\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.020\nAnd that is something good, they don't\ncall it a snapshots anymore in Hyper-V,\n\n466\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.700\nI can't remember what they call them now.\n\n467\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.630\n&gt;&gt; I think it's checkpoints.\n\n468\n00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.870\n&gt;&gt; Checkpoints, yeah, cuz I was going\nto stay restore points or something.\n\n469\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.160\nBut, Snapshots, okay?\n\n470\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.960\nThis is something that is good.\n\n471\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.830\nRemember this is not a substitute for\ngood backups.\n\n472\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n473\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.960\n&gt;&gt; As much as people go, yeah, I just have\na snapshot, I'm not worried about it.\n\n474\n00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.320\nWell this is not a substitute for\nbackups, but\n\n475\n00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.330\nit does give you this ability to go all\nright, here's a configuration I'm about to\n\n476\n00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:24.540\nhand Cherokee to configure and\nit's pretty complex here.\n\n477\n00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.430\nIt is a possibility that\nCherokee could do some of it.\n\n478\n00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.180\nBut then that second part,\nshe might not be able to figure out.\n\n479\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.690\nAnd we have to be able to\nroll this back quickly.\n\n480\n00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.230\nOr, Cherokee has to be able to reverse\nevery change that she made very quickly.\n\n481\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.870\nWell, the ability to take a snapshot\nbefore Cherokee changes it and\n\n482\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.550\nthen goes I changed this figure to this,\nthis is not going to work.\n\n483\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.845\nAnd she's on step 57 of 70.\n\n484\n00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:48.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:51.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, now she has to reverse 57 steps.\n\n486\n00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.470\nProbably the better option would be,\n\n487\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.980\nmake sure you have the snapshot available,\nbefore she started the configuration.\n\n488\n00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nThen we can roll it back to the point in\n\n489\n00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.780\ntime before that which is really helpful\nfor everything that we want to do.\n\n490\n00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Good point Ronnie, because I mean,\nwe wouldn't want to rely on those types of\n\n491\n00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.500\nfiles for any kind of suspected\nmalware because well,\n\n492\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.040\nthey're files and files can be infected so\njust keep that in mind also.\n\n493\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, one last thing that\nI want to show right here is\n\n494\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.540\nthe last option that we have on each VM.\n\n495\n00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.160\nYou have what we call this search that\nyou can look for, which allows you to\n\n496\n00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.016\nbe able to search out what performance\ndata more than anything else.\n\n497\n00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:34.520\nHere on XENSRV02, notice that\neach one gives a CPU utilization,\n\n498\n00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.430\nmemory usage, disk IO,\nnetwork addressing, up time.\n\n499\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.270\nYou name it gives us all\nof this information and\n\n500\n00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.670\nwhich we can create a search for\nit, if we need to.\n\n501\n00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.790\nYou like why does that mater, well if\nyou have hundreds of virtual machines\n\n502\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.500\nyou’re trying to figure out which\none is eating up the most resources.\n\n503\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.020\nHow much memory do you have utilize here?\n\n504\n00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.450\nSo in this one you can see that I got\nabout half the memory utilization.\n\n505\n00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.380\nAt some point you may go, this is why this\nmachine is not performing as well let's\n\n506\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.390\nsay as the other one if I use this\nsearch option, whereas saying look,\n\n507\n00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.460\nthere's nothing else on.\n\n508\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.380\nEven with nothing else on I'm almost\neating up a gig of memory just running\n\n509\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.050\nthe Zen Server itself.\n\n510\n00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.750\nSo without any VMs on you have\nthat ability to see all that.\n\n511\n00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.210\nSo this is why it's very important\nthat we're able to do this.\n\n512\n00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.640\nThe other thing that makes this\nintegration very possible and\n\n513\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.990\nthe ability to have it reported\nback to the XENSRVR and\n\n514\n00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.130\ndo everything that we want to, is to\nensure that when we also create the VMs\n\n515\n00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.120\nthat we add in those guest\ntools inside of every VM.\n\n516\n00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.900\nThere are people that go,\nI don't care about the guest tools but\n\n517\n00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.320\nto make networking and disk I/O\nutilization work as well as it does,\n\n518\n00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.300\nyou wanna make sure that you add\nthat in to every single one.\n\n519\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.000\nIf you're now gonna also be using\nXenCenter to be able to do some\n\n520\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.410\nmonitoring of your virtualization\nenvironment, you want those to be there\n\n521\n00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.420\nbecause that's what will report\neverything back to the XenCenter for you.\n\n522\n00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.630\nThat's what we get the details that\nyou see right here as well, okay?\n\n523\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.660\nAll right, two options that I keep\nforgetting as I look down here.\n\n524\n00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.550\nThat I wanted point out is,\nup here the top of my screen,\n\n525\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.500\nnotice there's a shutdown button,\nthere's a reboot, there's suspend, okay?\n\n526\n00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.130\nWell, we wanna make sure we understand\nwhat does options are about and\n\n527\n00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.859\nhow they work just briefly, just we do\nhave a couple of minutes left here.\n\n528\n00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.830\nShutdown is a graceful shutdown if,\nand that's a big if,\n\n529\n00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.580\nif you have the guest tools installed,\nokay.\n\n530\n00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.140\nSo if you wanted to and you go look,\nI don't wanna go into the machine and\n\n531\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.060\nto, Windows server, do a control,\nalt, delete, find the button,\n\n532\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.940\nthe power button and then go to\nshutdown and wait for the shutdown.\n\n533\n00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.660\nI wanna be able to issue a one\nbutton command to do so.\n\n534\n00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.320\nIf you have the Xen tools installed or\n\n535\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.200\nthe guest tools installed the Stop\nbutton will allow you to do that.\n\n536\n00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.590\nSo let me select that one here,\nand then notice it says Shut Down.\n\n537\n00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.680\nIt'll do a graceful shut down for you.\n\n538\n00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.450\nSame thing inside of\nthe Linux environment,\n\n539\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.540\nit'll do a graceful shut down for you.\n\n540\n00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.640\nYou want that as much as possible.\n\n541\n00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.250\nLike everything else if you don't,\n\n542\n00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:15.480\nit's like yanking the power cord\nout of that server and whatever\n\n543\n00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.640\nit was writing in the mean time you will\nget disc corruption that will go on.\n\n544\n00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.040\nAnd that's something you don't want to\nhave inside of your server environment.\n\n545\n00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.630\nSo pay attention to that.\n\n546\n00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.160\nRebuild as exactly like it sounds too,\nthat sounds good, but\n\n547\n00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.060\nsuspend is something\na little bit more unusual.\n\n548\n00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:38.850\nIf you needed to pause a machine literally\nmake it kind of stand still in time.\n\n549\n00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.580\nThat's what suspend does.\n\n550\n00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.330\nThe machine will never know\nthat you suspended it.\n\n551\n00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.030\nIt simply freezes it in time at that\npoint and it doesn't do anything.\n\n552\n00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.250\nAnd you may choose to do something\nlike that just to see hey,\n\n553\n00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.300\nI'm gonna be picking up\nexactly what I need to do.\n\n554\n00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.910\nBut there's something I need for\nit to stop for right now,\n\n555\n00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.850\nand you can use suspend as well.\n\n556\n00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.680\nSo different options that are available\nin every single VM that you have there\n\n557\n00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.910\ntoo, okay?\n\n558\n00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.020\nBut overall though,\n\n559\n00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.490\nthat's a lot of the VM properties that\nwe're going to kind of focus in on.\n\n560\n00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.690\nBut we still need to do a little bit\nmore in learning more about ZenCenter.\n\n561\n00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.280\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, I think we\nhave a really good head start for\n\n562\n00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.170\nsome specific configurations.\n\n563\n00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.790\nBut I think we're gonna dive a little bit\ndeeper in the future series or shows.\n\n564\n00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.080\nSo don't go anywhere, we have a lot\nmore configurations headed your way.\n\n565\n00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.590\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n566\n00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.550\nRemember I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n567\n00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.399\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:32.644\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n569\n00:32:32.644 --> 00:32:38.629\n[MUSIC]\n\n570\n00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.483\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n4\n00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:17.056\ngentleman to your Citrix XenServer show\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boost.\n\n5\n00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:21.284\nIf you've been following along, you've\nnoticed that we've already installed our\n\n6\n00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:25.159\nvisual machine in the previous episode,\nwe did a little bit of configuring but\n\n7\n00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.001\nwe need to pick right back up on that.\n\n8\n00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.020\nSo, with us today, we have Mr.\nRyan Wong in studio.\n\n9\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.570\nThank you for joining us today Ryan.\n\n10\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback as we continue our journey here\n\n11\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.300\nIn getting more familiar with using Citrix\nZen Server, in a production environment we\n\n12\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.810\nreally end up sticking with VMWare\na lot of times, Microsoft Hyper V.\n\n13\n00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.890\nYou know,\nthose are two great products, and\n\n14\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.330\nyou might not have ever considered an open\nsource type of product called Zen Server.\n\n15\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.300\nBut it is one that you might\nwant to consider as well, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.670\nCitrix Zen Server is a great utility\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.750\nthat's what we're jumping into as well.\n\n18\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.200\nAnd so at this point, you are right,\nthe very fact is we did get VMs installed.\n\n19\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.550\nBut we still need to finish up one last\nconfiguration in terms of VMs which is\n\n20\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.150\ngetting those guest tools installed\ninside of a Linux, distro instead.\n\n21\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.260\nNow when we do something like this,\nit really depends on the Linux distro.\n\n22\n00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.730\nBut we wanna show you some of the things\nthat you might actually encounter.\n\n23\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.310\nFor example, the distro that I chose\nwas a minimal install of CentOS.\n\n24\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.170\nNow when we talk about minimal install,\nit doesn't have a GUI.\n\n25\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250\nIt does not have\na Graphical User Interface.\n\n26\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.480\nSo that means I can't do like I did\ninside of Windows Cherokee, I can't just\n\n27\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.790\nput the ISO in and then double click\non it and it make it work, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.770\nSo we need to actually have a script, and\nthey include that inside of the ISO tools,\n\n29\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.690\nor the guest tools for\na XenServer here that\n\n30\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.300\nthere is a script that we can run to\ninstall those tools to make it available.\n\n31\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.410\nSo that's what we wanna show you how\nto do right here at the beginning and\n\n32\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.620\nthen we wanna move on and talk a little\nbit more about some storage too.\n\n33\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.260\nBut at this point let's go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n34\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.080\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n35\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.850\nAs my Cent OS install\nhas just finished here.\n\n36\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.466\nAnd now, it's waiting for me to log in and\nI'm gonna log in as the root.\n\n37\n00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:25.070\nAlso adding my super secret password.\n\n38\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.390\nAnd from right there, once I'm in here,\n\n39\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690\nthere's a couple of things\nthat I need to check.\n\n40\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.828\nThe first thing before you get installed\nhere, we need to those guest-tools ISO and\n\n41\n00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:42.329\nmake sure that we have it in store or\nready to go for that VM.\n\n42\n00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.980\nI wanna make sure that DVD drive is empty.\n\n43\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.346\nSo you might choose Eject if you\nstill had these media files, yeah,\n\n44\n00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:54.575\nthe instas, I can't remember what\nthey were called for CentOS.\n\n45\n00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:59.490\nMake sure that's how and\nthen scroll down to the very last one.\n\n46\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.110\nAnd then make sure that guest\ntools is now available inside.\n\n47\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.060\nSo this will allow, of course, that Linux\nmachine to be able to see this inside\n\n48\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.698\nof the device that they call their CD Rom.\n\n49\n00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:15.666\nNow before we do that, we need to\nbe able to make a directory, and\n\n50\n00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.910\nmount it inside of Linux\nto help us out here.\n\n51\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.300\nSo let me see if I can make\nthis a little bit larger\n\n52\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.480\nwithout locking up my\nscreen here to help us out.\n\n53\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.580\nLet me undock this for a moment.\n\n54\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.180\nAnd I'll move that over here.\n\n55\n00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.071\nI know that didn't help too much but,\nlet's see,\n\n56\n00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.410\nI'm probably not doing much\nof a great job doing this.\n\n57\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.394\nI'm trying to, but.\n\n58\n00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:49.706\nI was hoping I was doing better, but\nlet me make it smaller in like that, and\n\n59\n00:03:49.706 --> 00:03:51.271\nthen zoom in, that will work.\n\n60\n00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:53.940\nAt least I think it will work.\n\n61\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.210\nThere we go.\n\n62\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.101\nA little bit better.\n\n63\n00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.156\n[LAUGH] I think a little bit better.\n\n64\n00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:03.708\nSo the first thing I'm gonna\ndo is make a directory, mkdir.\n\n65\n00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:10.000\nI'm going to make it in the mount folder,\ncall it cdrom.\n\n66\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.403\nOnce I'm inside of that,\nnow I want to mount my device that\n\n67\n00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:22.394\nis called CD Rom inside of\nthat particular directory.\n\n68\n00:04:26.188 --> 00:04:26.880\nIf I can spell.\n\n69\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.800\nNotice it's mounting it as read-only,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n70\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.800\nNow that I have the Xen tools in there,\nthat's what I want to be able to do.\n\n71\n00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.990\nThen I need to navigate\ninto that directory.\n\n72\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.331\nSo I can do CD and then TCD rom.\n\n73\n00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:47.130\nAnd then I'm going to simply do a list.\n\n74\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.410\nI always liked doing lists, I don't know\nwhy, because I think I'm demonstrating it.\n\n75\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.890\nWhat I want is to get\naccess into the Linux.\n\n76\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.500\nDirectory or that Linux file.\n\n77\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.003\nSo cd Linux.\n\n78\n00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:09.154\nAnd this in here, the script that I\nwant to run is the install.sh, okay?\n\n79\n00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:14.531\nSo with the install.sh, that will run the\nZentools that I need to have ready to go.\n\n80\n00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:23.170\nFrom that point, and do install.sh.\n\n81\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.850\nAnd now it'll ask me, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n82\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.680\nIt tells you what is gonna do.\n\n83\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.790\nIt's going to go ahead and\nadd these utilities in.\n\n84\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.400\nAnd hit y and let it continue.\n\n85\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.540\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, is this going to be\nsimilar to what we saw in Windows where we\n\n86\n00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.410\ndo our restart, and\nthen we should be good to go?\n\n87\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, in theory we should actually be\nready to go once we install our Zen Tools,\n\n88\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.030\nand now we're ready to go.\n\n89\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.630\nNow they call it Guest Tools here.\n\n90\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.120\nSo let's go ahead and\nrestart this machine.\n\n91\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.360\nNow I have forgotten the commands before\nbecause I've been working in Windows as\n\n92\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.750\nwell as in Linux here a little bit.\n\n93\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.350\nSo let's take a look at the machine and\n\n94\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.370\nthat way we'll just type in reboot, which\nwe do have to thank one of our viewers for\n\n95\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.620\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; Mark.\n\n96\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mark, because I forgot and\nso now the machine is rebooting.\n\n97\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.860\nOnce it reboots we should then if\neverything goes right, and there it goes.\n\n98\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.380\nNow, mine's throwing a PCI Fatal thing,\nwhich is fine,\n\n99\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.900\nbecause it's in that virtual environment.\n\n100\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.169\nBut it should go back through,\nand in a moment, very quickly,\n\n101\n00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.198\nbecause this is the most minimal install\nwe can have, I should see the login.\n\n102\n00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:28.908\nIf I click on General,\n\n103\n00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:35.040\nnotice this time it is also now\noptimized with version 7.0 installed.\n\n104\n00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.500\nSo it really helps us out here.\n\n105\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.910\nReally one of the main features,\n\n106\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.800\nright, at making sure that we now have\naccess to a lot of the information\n\n107\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.590\nthat we would normally get reported\nespecially under performance.\n\n108\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.995\nNow you can see memory performance,\nCPU performance coming in.\n\n109\n00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:54.788\nNetwork performance, Disk I/O this is\nprobably the most important one for\n\n110\n00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:58.344\nour example, right, because we're\nrunning two virtual machines and\n\n111\n00:06:58.344 --> 00:06:59.848\nit's really one hard drive.\n\n112\n00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:03.300\nIt's not gonna be the greatest performance\nand all, but good enough for us for\n\n113\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.310\nour example.\n\n114\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.580\nSo that's what you're seeing here too,\n\n115\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.370\nis that there is a little bit of\nperformance that we have to worry about.\n\n116\n00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.530\nSo with that in mind right,\n\n117\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.849\nnow we need to move on to what we need\nto get set up for normally, right.\n\n118\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.250\nWith only one single Zen server,\nthat's kind of it, okay,\n\n119\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.450\nas far as getting a VM up and running.\n\n120\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.440\nMaking sure, of course,\n\n121\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.120\nthat your machines are networking is\nanother part of what you want to have.\n\n122\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.570\nSo when you start taking\na look at something like this.\n\n123\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.440\nRemember that you're actually\ngonna come up here and\n\n124\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.630\nyou're going to see networking as well.\n\n125\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.750\nIf I click on zen server,\n\n126\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.780\nnotice that there's a couple of different\nthings that we can point out here.\n\n127\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.500\nOkay.\n\n128\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.960\nThere is nicks.\n\n129\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.255\nThis one actually has one physical\nnick connected to it, but\n\n130\n00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:54.399\nthat's what it's representing,\nis the one connected to the host itself.\n\n131\n00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.695\nNotice that there is a Networking tab.\n\n132\n00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:01.535\nA Networking tab is where we\nwould create a virtual switch.\n\n133\n00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:05.325\nNow that's important because that\nessentially helps us to separate out\n\n134\n00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.820\ndifferent networks if we choose to.\n\n135\n00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.870\nSo the more of these virtual\nswitches that we add in\n\n136\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.190\nwe can separate them out even\nthough the Linux test machine and\n\n137\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.870\nthe web server that I created over here\nI can put them on two different networks\n\n138\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.640\nif I create their own switch and\nadd them in here for right now, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.478\nSo that way you might do that especially\nif you're working in a testing environment\n\n140\n00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:33.944\nof some sort or the idea of\nrestoring your back ups, right?\n\n141\n00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:37.078\nYou want to make sure that you\nhave everything up and going but\n\n142\n00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:41.195\nat the same time you know that you can't\nrestore to the real machine that is being\n\n143\n00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:42.440\nused right now.\n\n144\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.730\nYou can set up a completely different\ntest network in a virtual environment and\n\n145\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.700\nhave it kinda restore over to\nthat test environment instead.\n\n146\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.440\nSo there's a lot of\noptions that are available\n\n147\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.660\nwhen you start talking about working with\nthe VMs and doing what we need to, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.880\nBut besides that,\njust kinda pay attention there.\n\n149\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.760\nWe're gonna get more into that when\nwe start talking about bonding NICs\n\n150\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.260\ntogether a little bit, but\n\n151\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.330\nat the very beginning here I just want\nmake sure that we mention that too, okay.\n\n152\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.780\nSo let's talk about\nstorage just briefly for\n\n153\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.570\na moment as we start to\nsee what's going on here.\n\n154\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.910\nIn terms of storage with that one\nsingle XenServer remember that the only\n\n155\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.840\nplace that you're now storing VMs,\nis on that local storage.\n\n156\n00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.790\nBut what happens then at some point in\nthe future if that hard drive goes out?\n\n157\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.040\nWell that means you lose access to\nboth of your virtual machines, and\n\n158\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.358\nthat's never a good idea.\n\n159\n00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:41.310\nSo, Citrix's XenServer right, gives you\nthat ability instead to say hey look,\n\n160\n00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.140\nmaybe we don't want to rely\non local storage, design for\n\n161\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.040\nthat desktop environment or\neven a single server environment\n\n162\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.480\nbecause we can't expand a lot\nof that storage very quickly.\n\n163\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.575\nEven in today's world where servers are no\nlonger these kind of big, gigantic servers\n\n164\n00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:03.690\nthat are out there, 2U servers are fairly\ncommon, 3U not as common anymore.\n\n165\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.910\nBut 1U servers that are out there\ntoday are relatively common and\n\n166\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.710\nthat means you have a maximum number of\nhard drives that you're gonna install\n\n167\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.860\nin those particular servers.\n\n168\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.910\nSo what does that mean?\n\n169\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.680\nThat means that, as far as storage goes,\nyou're probably gonna rely on some\n\n170\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.530\nexternal device away from local storage,\nis what you're gonna do.\n\n171\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.230\n&gt;&gt; And that's very true.\n\n172\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.340\nYou even see Microsoft with their\nnew versions of storage pools,\n\n173\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.900\nwhere you can kind of even mix and match,\n\n174\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.850\nand it doesn't have to be that old school,\njust simply like raid configuration.\n\n175\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.480\nSo does Citrix have some kind\nof solution similar to that or\n\n176\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.480\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n177\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, you are talking about raid, but\n\n178\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.545\nwe're actually talking about different\ntypes of network based storage instead.\n\n179\n00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:48.630\nBut we are going off to an array such\nas a SAN as more than anything else.\n\n180\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:55.290\nSo SAN, or the storage area networks or\nthe network area storage appliances,\n\n181\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.350\nwe'll kind of get those confused\nas I start thinking about them.\n\n182\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.840\nThe great thing is even though\nthey might do a little bit\n\n183\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.520\ntechnically different in terms of\nconnecting to a Citrix itself or\n\n184\n00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.020\nto Xen Center itself, once they're\nconnected you can treat them all the same.\n\n185\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.970\nThey look identical inside of Citrix,\nso they interact identically, but\n\n186\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.270\nthe connection point makes\nit a little bit different.\n\n187\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.600\nLet's show at least at the beginning\nhere one or two of the things that we\n\n188\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.060\nmight actually choose to connect\nto when we start to do this, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.810\nSo the great thing is,\nwe've already talked about storage.\n\n190\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.280\nLet's go back to my machine just briefly.\n\n191\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.630\nWe already showed you how\nto create a ISO library.\n\n192\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.000\nAnd that's the type of storage\nrepository that we can create and\n\n193\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.140\nthat we have already used here.\n\n194\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.600\nThis one is, again, network based\nsomewhere else inside of this building.\n\n195\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.550\nIt's not directly on my\nlocal host machine, so\n\n196\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.170\nI can have access to more storage.\n\n197\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.800\nIt can be over the network, but\n\n198\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.068\nbecause of that particular network with\nall the other machines that may be on it,\n\n199\n00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:57.797\neven though with a switch we shouldn't\nhave too much of a connection.\n\n200\n00:11:57.797 --> 00:12:01.390\nThere maybe differences in\nterms of the NIC, the wire,\n\n201\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.530\nthe switch itself as well as the NIC\non this computer that I have.\n\n202\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.814\nSo it can be a little bit slow, but\nthe other ones that we can actually have\n\n203\n00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:13.790\naccess to, depends on what you\nhave inside of your network.\n\n204\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.880\nBut when you want to connect,\nyou just select now, New Storage.\n\n205\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.890\nSo if I select New Storage,\n\n206\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.730\nnotice that there are well, plenty of\ndifferent types of storage available.\n\n207\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.770\nThere's four specific ones\nthat we see right here and\n\n208\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.580\nthe first one is the network file system.\n\n209\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.180\nNetwork file system has been around for\na long, long time.\n\n210\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.110\nAnd we can continue to use that if\nthat's what we're comfortable with.\n\n211\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.170\nWe can store not only ISOs on them.\n\n212\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.950\nIf we choose to,\nwe can use that as our central storage for\n\n213\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.180\nall the VMs on our network.\n\n214\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.500\nNow remember that because NFS is an older\ntype of file system that is available,\n\n215\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.630\nit's not designed for\nhigh speed transfers.\n\n216\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.410\nCan it do it?\n\n217\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.050\nIt can do speedy transfers, but\n\n218\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.810\nyou're never gonna get real high speed\ntypes of transfers available, okay?\n\n219\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:10.030\nAnother one that is really\nnot designed for a high\n\n220\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:15.430\nperformance type of network option but\nis probably gonna be the easiest.\n\n221\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.535\n[SOUND] I shouldn't say that.\n\n222\n00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:18.967\nIt's probably gonna be the-\n&gt;&gt; The most compatible?\n\n223\n00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even in compatibility.\n\n224\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.790\nThe idea of the setup of ISCI is more\n\n225\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.862\nfriendly to people that have been\nworking in IP networks, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:31.750\nWhat they're doing is they're\nessentially taking iSCSI technology,\n\n227\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.450\nwhich is a hardware technology,\nsaying you can connect to it using what?\n\n228\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.040\nWell IP networks.\n\n229\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.760\nSo, you are essentially encapsulating\n\n230\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.560\na hardware type of protocol inside of\nIP network, to be able to work with it.\n\n231\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.210\nOkay?\n\n232\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.090\nSo, iSCSI is the one that we have.\n\n233\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.910\nNow iSCSI works, okay,\nand it works and it works.\n\n234\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.990\nBut in terms of really getting super high\nperformance out of it can you do it?\n\n235\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.180\nOnly if you treat it very special.\n\n236\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.560\nBy that, that means that\nthe iSCSI storage of course,\n\n237\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.250\nyou want to have multiple\nNICs attached to it.\n\n238\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.430\nYou want it to also, of course, be\nattached to its own dedicated switch for\n\n239\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.360\ndevices to connect in.\n\n240\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.590\nThe devices that are connecting into that,\n\n241\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.560\nto be able to be served\nby that iSCSI storage,\n\n242\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.900\nyou also wanna make sure that their NICs\ncan also support something else, too.\n\n243\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.850\nSo everything along the path\nhere has to support what we call\n\n244\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.200\njumbo frames if we do this.\n\n245\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.750\nAnd remember that in standard IP\nnetwork pretty much 1500 bytes,\n\n246\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.490\nsomewhere around there.\n\n247\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.240\nI'm not going to be\ntechnically correct there.\n\n248\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.630\n1500 bytes is kind of\nthe maximum size of a frame.\n\n249\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:46.229\nWhen we talk about jumbo frames you're\nnow saying hey let's move the size\n\n250\n00:14:46.229 --> 00:14:52.384\nof these frames up to about anywhere\nabout 9,000 bytes itself or megabits.\n\n251\n00:14:52.384 --> 00:14:53.681\n&gt;&gt; Bytes.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it is, bytes.\n\n252\n00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:57.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah essentially what we're doing is\nwe're looking at that header information.\n\n253\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:04.770\nWell if you take 9,000 divided by 1,500\nwe get about six and so if we take.\n\n254\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:10.550\nThat's only reducing that device by\nfive times looking at that information.\n\n255\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.693\nSo we should see the performance that we\nmay be lacking with that older technology.\n\n256\n00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it kind of washes out.\n\n257\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n258\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.040\nthat's why you have to have everything\nconsistently all in between, right?\n\n259\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.760\nThe applications that access this, they\nneed to be able to support jumbo frames.\n\n260\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.530\nThe NICs that access\nit need to be able to.\n\n261\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.600\nThe switch.\n\n262\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.560\nThe SCSI device,\nthe iSCSI device that you have.\n\n263\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.900\nAll that has to kind of be dedicated if\nyou want better performance off that.\n\n264\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.410\nBut if you're really only needing\nit to be able to access files and\n\n265\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.730\nit doesn't really have to require high\nstorage, you just need high volume\n\n266\n00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.730\niSCUZI will probably work just fine and\nyou won't have any real issues with it.\n\n267\n00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.252\nBut don't think that putting this on\nyour regular production network and\n\n268\n00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.705\nthen I'm just gonna\nattach all my VM's to it.\n\n269\n00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:58.301\nYou're gonna get the highest performance\nthat you want unless you really have\n\n270\n00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:01.146\neverything kind of treated the way\nthat you need it to, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:01.146 --> 00:16:05.720\nNow, just when I say that If you want the\nsuper high performance you instead gonna\n\n272\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.753\nlook like here the third option that\nwe have which is of course is gonna be\n\n273\n00:16:09.753 --> 00:16:10.858\nthe Hardware HBA.\n\n274\n00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:18.190\nThe Hardware HBA it let you know right\nhere at the top what it really means.\n\n275\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.510\nIt means fibre chart technology.\n\n276\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.940\nNow these are all stored based protocols,\nand\n\n277\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.680\nthat means that they are designed for\nhigh speed.\n\n278\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.870\nBut they also are designed for\n\n279\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.920\ntheir dedicated networking types of\ndevices that they are gonna use.\n\n280\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.200\nThe HBA hardware when you\nconnect something like this in.\n\n281\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:43.020\nIt really looks like a network adaptor,\nbut it really is a host bust controller.\n\n282\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.350\nIs what it really is.\n\n283\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.090\nSo it's a hard drive controller.\n\n284\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.900\nNow what does that make a difference?\n\n285\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.550\nBecause what it's really\ndoing is allowing you to say\n\n286\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.118\neven though the hard drive is somewhere\ninside of the closet behind me,\n\n287\n00:16:57.118 --> 00:17:02.540\nI wanna build access that on my\nmachine as if it's directly attached.\n\n288\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.460\nWell that means you need what, you need\na hard drive controller that can run to\n\n289\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.670\nyour device out here through cables and\neverything that we actually need.\n\n290\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.570\n&gt;&gt; That means more money.\n\n291\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it means a ton more money\nbecause everything is actually that\n\n292\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.100\nway where it's gonna be\nmuch more expensive.\n\n293\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.675\nBut you're paying for the performance.\n\n294\n00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:19.270\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n295\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.710\nyou also have that\navailable to you as well.\n\n296\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.310\nToday of course, but is also very popular,\n\n297\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:30.330\nis software fiber channel over ethernet,\nwhich is another popular addition.\n\n298\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.680\nNow this is a replace setting in the early\ndays of, I don't wanna say, early days,\n\n299\n00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.030\nearlier in time when Dell\nequal logic boxes were there.\n\n300\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.930\nThey had something called I think,\nthe storage link.\n\n301\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.140\nOr something like that.\n\n302\n00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.730\nSomething similar to that.\n\n303\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.480\nIs there proprietary technology\nin connecting them and\n\n304\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.290\nin version 6.2 they said look, we're\nsupporting it but it's probably going to\n\n305\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.250\ndisappear in the next version, and\nit has now disappeared in this version.\n\n306\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.890\nBut what they're recommending now of\ncourse is software based fibre channel.\n\n307\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.250\nNow why software based fibre channel?\n\n308\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.166\nBecause the expense of the hardware\nin Fiber Channel is insane, okay.\n\n309\n00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:11.430\nIn that particular sense\nthere are many different\n\n310\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.680\nways that they're saying well\nwe can use ethernet technology\n\n311\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.190\nto help us to reproduce some of the\nFiber Channel connections that we want.\n\n312\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.280\nBut just realize that you are gonna\nlose just a little bit since you're\n\n313\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.980\ntalking about really taking\nproprietory technology.\n\n314\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.390\nEncapsulating and\nover Ethernet is what to do.\n\n315\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Are you still talking about a minimum\nof Gigabytes speeds because you're dealing\n\n316\n00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.650\nwith those Jumbo frames?\n\n317\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.380\nSo you have to keep that in mind too.\n\n318\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's really all incumbent upon how much\n\n319\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.330\nyour company has the ability to expand or\nwilling to put up with.\n\n320\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.540\nIt's what we want to\nactually make sure of.\n\n321\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.540\nBut we wanna do to ensure at this point,\nright?\n\n322\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.710\nThat you at least understand the different\ntechnology options that you have in place\n\n323\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.800\nwhen you start to take a look.\n\n324\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.510\nBesides that though,\nwe really are going to implement then\n\n325\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.840\nour connection into a shared\nstorage connection.\n\n326\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.640\nLast thing that I want to mention right\nis that we're really setting up for\n\n327\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.640\nclustering.\n\n328\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.470\nAnd the only way for\n\n329\n00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:16.320\nus to do this where virtual machines can\nbe accessed from both machines relatively\n\n330\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.330\nquickly is by putting it onto some type\nof shared storage device like this.\n\n331\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.250\nWhether we're talking about the idea of\nNSF NFS, which I'm gonna say backwards,\n\n332\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.550\nlike I just said.\n\n333\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:33.670\niSCSI using the Hardware HBA which is\ngonna be your dedicated type of hardware,\n\n334\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.140\nor even that Software Fibre Channel\nover Ethernet.\n\n335\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.790\nAll of those are really going to be key\n\n336\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.270\nif we really want to implement sunlight\nclustering and then high availability.\n\n337\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.000\nTo where if one machine fails, those VMS\nwill at least be there on a separate\n\n338\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.070\ndevice that now the other\nZen server can access, too.\n\n339\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.150\nSo that's a part of it.\n\n340\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.390\nAnd that's what we\nnormally would want to do.\n\n341\n00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.050\nIdeally, if you know that you're gonna be\nclustering in the future, instead of doing\n\n342\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.330\nwhat we just did in the episode where\nwe're just treating one as a single\n\n343\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:10.890\nserver, and creating our virtual machines\nall on the individual local storage.\n\n344\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.930\nWe would go ahead and make a connection\ninto the ISCSI there instead and\n\n345\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.020\ncreate them there.\n\n346\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.170\nBut we do have to be careful,\nbecause once we actually try to do that\n\n347\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.440\nwe can't just add in a second machine and\naccess the same storage device.\n\n348\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.500\nIf you do that two machines\naccessing the same hard drive\n\n349\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.820\nit can cause disruptions and that\nactually break the physical disk itself.\n\n350\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.810\nSo that's why we don't\nwant to that immediately.\n\n351\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.410\nSo at this point we're gonna\nshow you how you create that and\n\n352\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.550\nthen we are gonna actually bring that in.\n\n353\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.640\nSo we're gonna make an ISCSI connection.\n\n354\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.500\nWe're gonna do some constrains as well.\n\n355\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.610\nBut at this point I've run out of time\nwhich means we have to save that for\n\n356\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.060\nthe next show on configuring storage\nthe way that we want as well.\n\n357\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's okay we\ndo have extra time to go ahead and\n\n358\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.250\ncreate a new episodes.\n\n359\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.520\nSo stay tuned ladies and\n\n360\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.960\ngentlemen because we do have some\nmore Xen server headed your way.\n\n361\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.150\nBut for this show like Ronnie said, we did\nrun out of time, so we'll go ahead and\n\n362\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.460\nsee you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n363\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.420\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n364\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.320\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n365\n00:21:10.320 -->

00:00:08.390\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.908\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:14.609\nWelcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n6\n00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.060\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.180\nIf you've been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.630\nyou'll notice that we've been talking\nabout custom configurations in creating\n\n9\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.480\nvirtual machines within\nyour XenServer environment.\n\n10\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.050\nIn this show, we'll be taking a look\nat setting up and creating clusters.\n\n11\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660\nSo with us today, we have Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.600\nRonnie Wong in studios to help set us\nup and walk us through this process.\n\n13\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.310\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.130\nWell, thank you for\nhaving me back as we continue on our\n\n15\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.140\nlittle journey here to understanding\na little bit more about Citrix XenServer.\n\n16\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.770\nWe are continuing on the process\nwhere last episode or\n\n17\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.420\na couple of episodes ago, it's beginning\nto kind of blur together about where I am.\n\n18\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.390\nWe really did take a look at\nthe idea of creating storage, right,\n\n19\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240\nstorage repositories.\n\n20\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.340\nWhen we talked about the different types\nof storage that we can create, and\n\n21\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.630\nwhen we created VMs, we also created\nthem on what we call the local storage.\n\n22\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.160\nRemember that means,\non each XenServer host,\n\n23\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.460\nthe VMs are essentially hosted right\nthere inside that local storage.\n\n24\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.950\nAnd if you think about that, that sounds\nlike a great idea, because well, that's\n\n25\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.121\npretty much the only storage that we had\nif we only have one XenServer available.\n\n26\n00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:22.940\nBut if I have multiple\nXenServers available to me and\n\n27\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.760\nI wanna be able to take advantage of,\nwell a couple of different things.\n\n28\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.950\nOne, the idea of redundancy to help me\nto eliminate single points of failure.\n\n29\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.310\nTwo, I could also be able to access\ninstead of creating two different\n\n30\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.240\nstorage locations, access a single\nlocation in terms of storage.\n\n31\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.410\nThen I wanna begin to create what we\ncall a cluster to help us do that.\n\n32\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.022\nAnd that means clustering two\nXenServer hosts together, and\n\n33\n00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:55.354\nreally making them managed as one and\nalmost performing as one as well.\n\n34\n00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:58.390\nThe advantage of that, like we said,\nis really about failure.\n\n35\n00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.360\nIf one fails, the other one is still\navailable for us and that's a good thing.\n\n36\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.100\nWell we can't even stress how important\nthat redundancy is in today's environment\n\n37\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.370\nthat you hear all the time trying to have\nour five nines our constant of time and\n\n38\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.470\nwell this is a way you can go ahead and\nprovide that for your organization.\n\n39\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.500\nIt really is.\n\n40\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.690\nThe neat thing about it, right,\nis because of the way that we work today,\n\n41\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.640\nwe start to realize that really a lot\nof the slow downs that we have,\n\n42\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.550\nespecially when it comes\nto maintaining and\n\n43\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.280\nmonitoring systems,\nis when systems go down.\n\n44\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.910\nSo when we start talking about\nvirtualization environments, right?\n\n45\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.850\nWe're normally not saying,\njust two machines going down, what\n\n46\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.970\nwe're really saying is all the machines in\nthat virtualization environment go down.\n\n47\n00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.950\nAnd that's something we\nreally want to prevent.\n\n48\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.140\nClustering gives us that ability to do so.\n\n49\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.860\nDepending on how we cluster them together,\nand\n\n50\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.110\nthe hardware,\nthe underlying hardware that we also have,\n\n51\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.690\nsupporting that cluster it could be\nwith super high performance hardware.\n\n52\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.730\nAnd if everything is configured\nthe way that you want to,\n\n53\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.400\nthe downtime is relatively\nminimal when a machine goes down.\n\n54\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.050\nThe first time that I ever experienced\nthis in a non-cluster environment,\n\n55\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.660\neven with two different\nvirtualization hosts,\n\n56\n00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.400\nusing the same virtualization\ntechnology we still had to move all of\n\n57\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.070\nthose VMs that we are able to access off\nthose drives that were on local storage.\n\n58\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.260\nAnd then export them and\n\n59\n00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.050\nmove them over to the other XenServer\nwhich still took hours for us to do.\n\n60\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.665\nBut it was faster than\nwhat we had done before.\n\n61\n00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:34.024\nBut now we're talking about maybe we can\ndo this within a mere matter of minutes,\n\n62\n00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:38.127\nif not almost instantaneously if you do\nset up some type of configuration for\n\n63\n00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:41.163\nwhat we call high availability\nconfiguration as well.\n\n64\n00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:45.739\nSo it gives us to have ability to do so\nif we have everything in place that we\n\n65\n00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.260\nneed to, so\nwhere does this idea really begin?\n\n66\n00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.480\nWell, it begins with\nthat idea of storage too.\n\n67\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.168\nSo, one of the shows that we did where\nwe would talk about the storage,\n\n68\n00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.180\none of the last things I said is, hey,\n\n69\n00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.590\nwe are going to connect to\na remote storage unit, right?\n\n70\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.696\nSo, I have an Sam target that\nI've set up previously, and\n\n71\n00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.821\nwe just didn't have time\nto do it on the show.\n\n72\n00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:11.536\nSo, it's a great place for us to pick up\nright now and make sure that we understand\n\n73\n00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:15.365\nhow to configure that and then we'll move\ninto the clustering environment and then\n\n74\n00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:19.390\ntalk about how we connect that and why we\nhave to be worried about that as a well.\n\n75\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.595\nSo let's go ahead and start right there\nas we kind of pick up where we left off.\n\n76\n00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:24.521\nThat way I don't leave anything out and\n\n77\n00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:25.765\nthen we'll have a good start\nto clustering as well.\n\n78\n00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.130\nSounds good to me.\n\n79\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.020\nOkay, so we're just gonna take\nthe idea of Xen Xerver 01 again And\n\n80\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.200\nwe're gonna treat it as if it's\njust a standalone environment.\n\n81\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.994\nEven in a standalone\nenvironment offloading all\n\n82\n00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.922\nyour VMs to a device that's designed for\nstorage,\n\n83\n00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:45.040\nright, designed for high speed access,\nis probably a good idea.\n\n84\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.140\nNow I'm using iSCSI,\nwhich means there are some limitations\n\n85\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.150\nunless I have everything\nspecially configured.\n\n86\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd if you go back and see that show\nI talked about the very fact that it\n\n87\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.900\nreally does need its own dedicated switch.\n\n88\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.910\nWe need to make sure that we have\neverything kinda set up the way that we\n\n89\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.690\nwant to.\n\n90\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.719\nHardware as well as software that's\naccessing it, whatever it might be that\n\n91\n00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.000\nit's designed to conform to everything\nthat makes iSCSI perform well.\n\n92\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.320\nBut in a testing environment,\nit's on my regular network.\n\n93\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.990\nSo I'm not really looking for performance\nso much as much as just to connect in.\n\n94\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.760\nNow when we say that we're not\nhere to show you how to configure\n\n95\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.980\na nice gauzy target on your own network.\n\n96\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.090\nEverybody that uses whatever appliance\nthat you use and whatever device\n\n97\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.230\nthat you use you can set this one up\ndepending on those configurations.\n\n98\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.090\nBut once it’s done inside a XenServer,\nlike I said previously, the great thing is\n\n99\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.800\nonce it looks like storage inside\na XenServer, you treat it like storage.\n\n100\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.060\nYou don't have to kind of worry\nabout a lot of special tweaks or\n\n101\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.100\nanything like that.\n\n102\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.760\nIt just has to be done.\n\n103\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.350\nSo that's what we're gonna do right now.\n\n104\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.976\nWe're just gonna consider XenServer 01 and\nwe're gonna attach it to an iSCSI\n\n105\n00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:53.920\nstorage appliance, so we're gonna\ncreate a new repository to do that.\n\n106\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.110\nSo the easiest way for\n\n107\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.840\nus to do this, is to take a look at\nusing this toolbar up here at the top.\n\n108\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.980\nAnd then, look at that, New Storage.\n\n109\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.060\nAnd we'll do it the way that we were\nwalking through it, a little bit earlier.\n\n110\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.990\nWe'll click New Storage.\n\n111\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.800\nFrom there, I'm going to select the iSCSI,\nfor this particular target instead.\n\n112\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.970\nAnd now it says, hey,\nit's either SCSI or channel access.\n\n113\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.740\nWell, we're gonna do the iSCSI\nstorage is what we're going to select.\n\n114\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.010\nClick Next.\n\n115\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.990\nFrom this point,\nwe can call it whatever we want to.\n\n116\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.548\nI'm gonna do ITProTVDemo and\n\n117\n00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:34.393\nyou can call it, let's say, storage.\n\n118\n00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:38.350\nNow this is a little bit of a long\nname here as you start to see that.\n\n119\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.030\nI'm not so worried about it.\n\n120\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.740\nGet out of that, click Next.\n\n121\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.690\nI'll try to click Next.\n\n122\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.890\nNow I need the IP address of where\nthis device will be located.\n\n123\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.190\nHere is normally the default port.\n\n124\n00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.200\nSo you don't normally have to\nchange anything right here.\n\n125\n00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.920\nBut is iSCSI that's the 3260 is kind of\nthe default port number that you get.\n\n126\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.503\nIf you change that and make sure you note\nthat as well and change it here too.\n\n127\n00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:08.680\nIf you're gonna use CHAP\nthis is a great idea.\n\n128\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.044\nI'm in a testing environment,\n\n129\n00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:12.677\nin a production environment\nyou want to use CHAP.\n\n130\n00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:16.793\nMake sure you have some authentication so\nthat you are connecting to the right\n\n131\n00:07:16.793 --> 00:07:20.800\nappliance and that you are connecting\nto the right target that you want to.\n\n132\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.474\nThen if everything is set\nup on the other side.\n\n133\n00:07:23.474 --> 00:07:29.770\nIn other words if your iSCSI target is set\nup, all we have to do is select scan host.\n\n134\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.990\nTarget host.\n\n135\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.970\nAnd in a moment once it scans the actual\ntarget host, it will come up and\n\n136\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.665\nfind the iSCSI target and\nnow notice it says select target IQN.\n\n137\n00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:43.300\nClick on this drop down.\n\n138\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.310\nIt will give me all\nthe possible iSCSI storage\n\n139\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.870\nthat I have available to us to do, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.690\nSo the great thing is I\nreally only setup this one.\n\n141\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.058\nThe one here at the very top.\n\n142\n00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.954\nThere's a lot, you see three, but\nthis is the one that I set up.\n\n143\n00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:01.998\nAnd you can see where I\nactually marked is as xen01.\n\n144\n00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:06.094\nAnd here's the IP address I\nselected with that, 3260.\n\n145\n00:08:06.094 --> 00:08:08.200\nSo that is the one I am going to select.\n\n146\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.700\nSo you'll notice it's not\nreally super difficult.\n\n147\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.950\nThe most difficult part for\n\n148\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.040\nthis was really about getting\njust the target set up.\n\n149\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.680\nBut being smart, being smarter I should\nsay I didn't even try to manually do that.\n\n150\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.240\nI simply walked through the wizard and\n\n151\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.680\nsaid, here's the size of the iSCSI target\nI need on my storage appliance, on my SAN.\n\n152\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.610\nAnd I walked through and\nI said exactly what I needed.\n\n153\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.610\nI didn't make a gigantic\niSCSI target at this point.\n\n154\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.550\nAnd you can see now where you also have\nto pick out what we call the LUN, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.890\nThis is very important.\n\n156\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.330\nIf you have a LUN or not,\nyou'll actually see it here.\n\n157\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:51.458\nSo mine is a 100 gigabyte LUN that's\nactually on a QNAP appliance.\n\n158\n00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:53.160\nAt that point, I'll click Finish.\n\n159\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.150\nAnd now it's gonna scan on over across\nmy network to create this connection\n\n160\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.939\ninto this iSCSI here.\n\n161\n00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.108\nNotice it says, creating this,\nif there's any existing data on it,\n\n162\n00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:08.670\nit's gonna wipe it clean.\n\n163\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.500\nYou wanna be careful, right?\n\n164\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.620\nIf you continue on and you go, yeah,\nI know, I'll just reuse an old one.\n\n165\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.363\nMake sure know what data is on that\nold one before you just wipe it clean.\n\n166\n00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:25.270\nCuz if not, it's just telling you,\nlook, remember, it's done.\n\n167\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.610\nYeah, if you do this,\nthere's no recovering this.\n\n168\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.790\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n169\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.260\nAnd do you want to format?\n\n170\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.877\nYes, I do.\n\n171\n00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:36.790\nSo I know that since I created it for the\nshow, there shouldn't be anything on it.\n\n172\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.018\nFormatting makes it ready for\nme to use it as a storage device.\n\n173\n00:09:41.018 --> 00:09:46.070\nIdeally, it would be better if I started\n\n174\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.860\nthem before I set up all of the two\nvirtual machines that I created here,\n\n175\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:57.520\nnot on the local storage, but on this one,\non this particular device instead.\n\n176\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.230\nNow you can see that\ninside of XenServer01,\n\n177\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.910\nit shows multiple storage devices.\n\n178\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.360\nThere's the local storage that\nwe had at the very beginning.\n\n179\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.000\nThere is no removable storage,\neven though it says that there might be.\n\n180\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.610\nThere is a single DVD drive on\nthe machine that I'm using, and\n\n181\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.760\nthere is of course my\niSCSI storage appliance.\n\n182\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.200\nAnd it's saying 4 megabytes\nused out of 100 gigs.\n\n183\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.343\nThat'll work for right now.\n\n184\n00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:29.990\nSo we're not actually using\nvery much of it to help us out.\n\n185\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:35.900\nIf I go and take a look on the left-hand\nside, I can also see of course,\n\n186\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.840\nthe itprotvdemo-storage here.\n\n187\n00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.088\nOnce I see that,\nI can now take a look at its properties.\n\n188\n00:10:47.088 --> 00:10:49.950\nAnd notice that I can change\nits name if I want to.\n\n189\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.485\nI can add in some tags.\n\n190\n00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:54.161\nI'm not going to do anything\non the general properties, for\n\n191\n00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:56.427\nright now cuz there's really not much for\nme to do.\n\n192\n00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:58.310\nIf I click on Storage.\n\n193\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:04.140\nNow you can continue to add in other\nscans for your VDIs if you need to.\n\n194\n00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.760\nSo your virtual disks.\n\n195\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.910\nBut this is where it begins.\n\n196\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.800\nNow, there is a little bit of contention\nthat you have to keep in mind.\n\n197\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.540\nFor me,\nif these are all my local storage and\n\n198\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.694\nI need to move them over to\nthe iSCSI appliance at this point,\n\n199\n00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:26.779\nwell, it may be where I have to export\nthis over to it, or I can try this.\n\n200\n00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:28.270\nAnd let's go ahead and try this.\n\n201\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.632\nI can right click on one of them.\n\n202\n00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:32.730\nI'm going to choose the smaller\nappliance at this point, or\n\n203\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.137\nthe smaller VM that I made.\n\n204\n00:11:34.137 --> 00:11:37.447\nAnd then select move the VM.\n\n205\n00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.339\nAnd now it's going to ask me for\nthe destination.\n\n206\n00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:41.919\nAnd let's see.\n\n207\n00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:47.100\nOn [INAUDIBLE] let's see, do I want, this\nactually just lets me move it to the pool.\n\n208\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.683\nSo here, let's see if I can do that.\n\n209\n00:11:51.683 --> 00:11:53.650\nDoes it get, no,\nit's just saying the home server.\n\n210\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.700\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.240\nSo when we start to take a look here.\n\n212\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.750\nYou select, of course, the device\nthat's going to be the home server.\n\n213\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.410\nThat means when it boots up, where does\nit really want to reside at this point?\n\n214\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.200\nAnd once I chose that,\nthen it also showed the machine.\n\n215\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.985\nAnd then it showed me what was\navailable as far as the repository.\n\n216\n00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:18.280\nWhy can't I say that word?\n\n217\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.300\nPlace all virtual disks\nin the same repository.\n\n218\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.395\nOr I can choose to place it in a different\none if I had another one available.\n\n219\n00:12:26.838 --> 00:12:28.700\nFrom here you click Next.\n\n220\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:35.090\nAnd now it will begin the move, is what we\nshould end up seeing here after a while.\n\n221\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.550\nSo it may take a little bit of time.\n\n222\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.490\nAnd you can see it's\ncreated at this point here.\n\n223\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.150\nSo after a while, you know, it will end\nup where everything will be stored here.\n\n224\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.809\nAnd that's what it looks like it's doing.\n\n225\n00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:50.132\nI'm trying to see if it's\nactually going to tell me\n\n226\n00:12:50.132 --> 00:12:53.473\nin the end here if everything's\nbeen moved or not.\n\n227\n00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:57.760\nBut if everything has moved on over\nto the way that we believe in.\n\n228\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.311\nI'm trying to.\n\n229\n00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:01.123\nI think it's actually done here.\n\n230\n00:13:01.123 --> 00:13:01.972\nLet's verify.\n\n231\n00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:07.606\nSo that looks good.\n\n232\n00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:10.075\nIt says the location is there.\n\n233\n00:13:10.075 --> 00:13:13.929\nLet me see if I start this machine up,\nor is it going to balk at me if I do so?\n\n234\n00:13:17.073 --> 00:13:17.952\nCheck that out, and\n\n235\n00:13:17.952 --> 00:13:20.972\nwe'll see if it's actually going\nto work here in what we're doing.\n\n236\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.020\nIt's not ready yet.\n\n237\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.800\nSo it's just gonna hang out\nuntil it's actually ready for\n\n238\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.820\nme to get everything done and\nmoved on over.\n\n239\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.400\nAll right.\n\n240\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.544\nSo in that point, there is the actual\nconnection that we needed.\n\n241\n00:13:37.544 --> 00:13:40.646\nAnd the only thing we really were meant to\ndo of course at this point is to show you\n\n242\n00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:42.120\nthat we could do this.\n\n243\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.179\nThere is a problem, though.\n\n244\n00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:48.640\nSince I only have one iSCSI target,\nbut I have two different servers.\n\n245\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.710\nWell, what happens when two servers end up\ntrying to access the same storage device?\n\n246\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.130\nThat's what we have to figure out.\n\n247\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.490\nWill they be inundating a particular\nnetwork interface card?\n\n248\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.470\nSo would this be where we\nlooked at the previous episode,\n\n249\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.960\nour different options of\ncreating bonding there?\n\n250\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.300\nWell, we could do that, okay.\n\n251\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.028\nBut at this point, you've gotta realize\nsomething, that two machines trying to\n\n252\n00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:12.640\naccess a single hard drive,\nit's gonna cause corruption, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.791\nSo if I wanted both of those machines\nto really share that ITProTV storage,\n\n254\n00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:23.209\nI can't just simply come in here and add\nit again and that way have access to it.\n\n255\n00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:27.130\nBecause we don't want that to happen\nwhere both machines are doing that.\n\n256\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.921\nInstead, the way that we would have\nto do this is to configure our\n\n257\n00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.050\nXen servers in a way and\nmake it appear as?\n\n258\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:35.651\nOne unit?\n\n259\n00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:36.690\nOne unit.\n\n260\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.140\nWhich is the idea of clustering.\n\n261\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.174\nSo that's how we got to this point.\n\n262\n00:14:40.174 --> 00:14:42.678\nI know,\nit was kind of a long drawn out way, but\n\n263\n00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:46.613\nthat's the idea that we have available\nwhen we start to see this, okay.\n\n264\n00:14:46.613 --> 00:14:50.721\nSo that is normally what\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n265\n00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:54.315\nNow, when we start talking about\nclustering, there are things that we have\n\n266\n00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:57.840\nto kind of consider when we\ndo something like this, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.680\nOne, if we already set up some other\nthings silly like I just did, right?\n\n268\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.475\nSetting up that ITProTV storage on\nthat storage repository on that single\n\n269\n00:15:07.475 --> 00:15:10.530\nXenServer, it may still\nallow me to go ahead and\n\n270\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.560\ncreate the cluster, but even if I do, I\nwon't be able to access that iSCSI target.\n\n271\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.351\nThe reason why is right now is\ncuz it's attached only to one.\n\n272\n00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:23.159\nAnd it's not gonna automatically move that\nattachment over to the clustered storage\n\n273\n00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:24.710\nif I do so, okay.\n\n274\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.130\nSo usually if you've done\nany NIC bonding already,\n\n275\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.130\nyou may find out it doesn't\ncarry over into the cluster.\n\n276\n00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.808\nSo you may have to go back and kind of\nremove the NIC bonding that you might do.\n\n277\n00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:40.833\nYou might have to go back and actually\nremove the storage repository as well,\n\n278\n00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:45.490\nand make sure everything is really\nkind of in between what we need.\n\n279\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.874\nWhich is that they're standalone,\ntwo individual servers by themselves.\n\n280\n00:15:49.874 --> 00:15:54.032\nNow, before we get into the idea\nhere of creating the storage,\n\n281\n00:15:54.032 --> 00:15:57.728\nthere are a few caveats that\nwe want to pay attention to.\n\n282\n00:15:57.728 --> 00:15:58.541\nOf course there are.\n\n283\n00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.572\nYeah, it just happens that way.\n\n284\n00:16:00.572 --> 00:16:06.329\nIdeally, both machines would be\nidentical in hardware, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:10.570\nIf you have 32 gigs of ram in one,\nyou want 32 gigs ram in the other.\n\n286\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:16.300\nIf you want five terabytes of\nhard drive space in one, you want\n\n287\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.762\nfive terabytes in the other, you want the\nsame CPU, you want them to be identical.\n\n288\n00:16:20.762 --> 00:16:22.850\nBut XenServer is smart enough and\n\n289\n00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.610\nit's such great software that it\nreally doesn't have to be identical.\n\n290\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.650\nSo it used to be if you want\nto do something like this,\n\n291\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.962\nyou want to make sure that the NICs were\nexactly the same, that would be helpful.\n\n292\n00:16:32.962 --> 00:16:36.460\nBut XenServer says as long\nas they're good in their\n\n293\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.940\nquality, okay, then it will work fine.\n\n294\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.580\nBut what you don't want\nis I got a gigabit NIC,\n\n295\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.160\nand I got a 100 megabit NIC,\nyou're not gonna be able to bond those and\n\n296\n00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.460\nthey won't work over shared\nstorage either, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.120\nSame thing when you start doing stuff like\nthis, you want to make sure as much as\n\n298\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.520\npossible to make sure everything goes\nsmoothly without any interruptions at all.\n\n299\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.900\nEverything's equal, identical,\nand the way that they need to be.\n\n300\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.490\nBut if they're not, they will still work.\n\n301\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.690\nWhich is pretty cool, because in a perfect\nenvironment, we have an unlimited budget.\n\n302\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.100\nBut that's not always the case, and\n\n303\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.610\nsometimes you have to work with\nthe tools that you already have.\n\n304\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.580\nThat's true.\n\n305\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.370\nThe only thing that you really\nwanna make sure of though,\n\n306\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.810\nis in the CPU utilization as you do this.\n\n307\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.040\nIf we start bringing out VMs inside\nof that clustered environment,\n\n308\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.140\nI have one CPU that's let's say\nit's running at like a core i5, and\n\n309\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.000\nthe other one is running an i7 processor.\n\n310\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.950\nYou won't be able to do, very easily,\nwhat we'll call live migrations,\n\n311\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.035\nto make sure that everything\nlike if one machine shuts down,\n\n312\n00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:42.810\nbecause it's now realizing that there's\na hardware difference is what it will see.\n\n313\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.330\nSo if one is an I5 and\none's an i7 the i7 shuts down\n\n314\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.210\nwell now you're telling it that\nwhat exists is what an i5.\n\n315\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.850\nAnd it was really configured for\nan i7 the VM make up.\n\n316\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.125\nI need to reboot or I need to shut\ndown before it comes back up again.\n\n317\n00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:02.410\nSo you do want to make sure you\ncheck that out as much as you can,\n\n318\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.790\nat least somewhat comfortable as well and\neasy.\n\n319\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:11.760\nIf you have the graphics,\ncan't remember what I was trying to say,\n\n320\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.490\nif you have a graphics\nadapter inside of your\n\n321\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.660\nhost machine that's already built in,\nlet's say, to the CPU and\n\n322\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.960\nthe other one doesn't have it,\nmore than likely it's not gonna use it.\n\n323\n00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.740\nSo, even if you have VMs that say,\nyes, I wanna use it, and\n\n324\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.880\nthe other one that you're now clustering\nto says, I don't have that available.\n\n325\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.606\nYou're probably gonna see that in\nthe clustered environment you might not\n\n326\n00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:35.522\nget access to it as well.\n\n327\n00:18:35.522 --> 00:18:36.251\nOkay.\n\n328\n00:18:36.251 --> 00:18:38.224\nSo it might eliminate\nsome of those features.\n\n329\n00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:43.439\nAnd the same thing, if you try to do a 100\nmegabit NIC to a gigabit NIC, you might\n\n330\n00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:49.390\nfind out it goes, I'll use a gigabit,\nbut I'm not going to a 100 megabit NIC.\n\n331\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.862\nSo, as much as you can,\nidentical would be ideal.\n\n332\n00:18:52.862 --> 00:18:54.750\nOkay.\nBut it doesn't have to be that way.\n\n333\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.654\nSo that's kind of just a good hint, when\nthings go wrong check your configurations\n\n334\n00:18:59.654 --> 00:19:04.137\nin that remember that if they're not,\nyou may not be able to do that smooth,\n\n335\n00:19:04.137 --> 00:19:08.199\nwhat we call live migration of VMs\nto where if one machine shuts down,\n\n336\n00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:12.086\nit automatically knows how to\nmigrate them over to the other one.\n\n337\n00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:16.053\nAnd may require a reboot or\nmay require a shut down of that VM and\n\n338\n00:19:16.053 --> 00:19:17.516\nthen start it back up.\n\n339\n00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:21.628\nSo, there's is a lot new neat\nfeatures if everything's identical,\n\n340\n00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:25.530\nbecause if you are hosting all your\nVMs on that shared storage now,\n\n341\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.407\nthe only thing that you're really doing\nis you're saying, here's the VM that's\n\n342\n00:19:30.407 --> 00:19:34.937\nshutting down, let me copy what's in\nthat RAM over to the other XenServer and\n\n343\n00:19:34.937 --> 00:19:40.190\nnow that's all that's done because the\nshared storage is in the middle, right?\n\n344\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:45.717\nIt has the VHD, [LAUGH] It has\nthe virtual hard disk- One of those?\n\n345\n00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:49.451\nThat's available, so the only thing\nthat you're really moving is what's\n\n346\n00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:53.540\ncopied in RAM over to the other machine,\nwhich makes it really fast.\n\n347\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.840\nUntil they're not identical, right?\n\n348\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.230\nThen it's like, okay I copied it over\nhere, but the CPU's not the same.\n\n349\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:04.640\nSo for me, I'd have to reboot, recognize\nnew CPU, get everything up and running.\n\n350\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.670\nBut overall though, you can do this, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.200\nSo I was trying to make sure that\neverything was kind of done and\n\n352\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.380\nover with before I tried\nto prepare everything.\n\n353\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.130\nBut we'll go ahead and see what we can do.\n\n354\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.879\nOne of things I wanna do then before I\nget started, is I want to detach these\n\n355\n00:20:19.879 --> 00:20:24.970\nstorage repository, so it might be\nin the middle of something I know,\n\n356\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.210\nI probably just kind of ruin something\nhere, but we'll see here in a moment.\n\n357\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.256\nI'm going to just go ahead and\nforget it, so it's not there,\n\n358\n00:20:31.256 --> 00:20:32.845\nthat way I don't get confused.\n\n359\n00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:37.392\nI get confused very easily when I see\nthings like, yeah I removed that and\n\n360\n00:20:37.392 --> 00:20:40.150\nthen it's still showing up, it bothers me.\n\n361\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.460\nSo I'm just getting that out of there for\nright now.\n\n362\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.194\nSo at this point, I may have also ruined\nthis virtual machine but it's fine.\n\n363\n00:20:48.194 --> 00:20:50.650\nNow we need to configure storage.\n\n364\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.870\nOkay, to configure the cluster.\n\n365\n00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.170\nSo this is what XenServer's good at,\n\n366\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.350\nit's what they call that\nheterogeneous resource pool.\n\n367\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.490\nIt's the same as clustering.\n\n368\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.950\nBut they're saying it doesn't have\nto be clustered identical hardware.\n\n369\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.420\nBecause we can do everything\njust like we talked about.\n\n370\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.940\nAll that can actually be done.\n\n371\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.560\nWe combine them together to essentially\nwork as one to host all the VMs together.\n\n372\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.330\nAnd the only limitation\nby Citrix XenServer,\n\n373\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.830\nat least in their documentation,\n\n374\n00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:24.300\nsays when you create this resource cluster\na maximum of up to 16 hosts per cluster.\n\n375\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.360\nNow just when they say that, they also\nhave it inside of parenthesis where they\n\n376\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.170\nsay, even though this is a limit,\nXenServer has never enforced this.\n\n377\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.720\nSo that means they're saying,\nyou can go beyond this, but\n\n378\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.730\n16 seems to be at least the limitation\nthat they've actually done,\n\n379\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.500\nas far as the single\nresource pool as well.\n\n380\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.500\nSo let's go ahead and begin this idea of\nclustering by creating this resource pool.\n\n381\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.365\nNow just when you think\nthis is something hard and\n\n382\n00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:51.743\nit's something that's gonna\nbe overwhelming, it's not.\n\n383\n00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:55.900\nRight up here at the top again,\nwe can point it out.\n\n384\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.869\nNotice it says new pool, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:58.869 --> 00:22:03.010\nSo once we have that I\ncan click on new pool.\n\n386\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.290\nNow I can give it a name.\n\n387\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:11.290\nAnd we will call this one itprotvdemo,\nas far as the pool goes.\n\n388\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.710\nAnd now it's asking me for a master.\n\n389\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.090\nLike anything else in a cluster,\none of them has to be the master and\n\n390\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.110\neverybody else doesn't have to be.\n\n391\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:23.272\nSo I'm just gonna choose my XenServer\n01 as being the master of this\n\n392\n00:22:23.272 --> 00:22:24.430\nparticular pool.\n\n393\n00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.920\nIf I wanted to,\nthe nice thing about this is, notice,\n\n394\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.320\nI can just add in another\nserver into the pool.\n\n395\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.620\nI don't have to take\neverybody out of the pool,\n\n396\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.100\nrecreate a new cluster\nif a third one comes in.\n\n397\n00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.800\nI can now just add in as I bring\nup another XenServer host.\n\n398\n00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.830\nI can go ahead and\nclick add here or add new server and\n\n399\n00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.270\nthat will allow me to that there too.\n\n400\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.920\nWould you consider that\na hot swappable feature or\n\n401\n00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.170\ndo I need to power anything down before\nI go ahead and add additional servers?\n\n402\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.870\nNope, you can actually do it right there\nlive, as you have a third server on hand.\n\n403\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.020\nYou should be able to bring\nit right in to the cluster.\n\n404\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.243\nIt might take a little bit of time before\nit gets everything configured correctly,\n\n405\n00:23:03.243 --> 00:23:07.120\nbut you just have to make sure,\nand that's what I recommend,\n\n406\n00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.673\nis verify that you're seeing\nthe technology go across all the different\n\n407\n00:23:11.673 --> 00:23:16.922\nXenServers that you have, and then you're\nready to go, and we'll create a pool.\n\n408\n00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:21.382\nAnd once I select that,\nnow notice that over here on\n\n409\n00:23:21.382 --> 00:23:26.361\nthe left hand side in my navigation\npain I have now added in\n\n410\n00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:30.440\nXenServer 01 into the pool\ncalled IT Pro TV.\n\n411\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:38.990\nNotice that XenSRV02 though is indented,\na less than what you see here on XenSRV01.\n\n412\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.640\nAnd that means that they have not yet\nadded that one into the pool.\n\n413\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.804\nBut we've created this pool of\nresources to, at least begin to do so.\n\n414\n00:23:48.804 --> 00:23:52.388\nIf I right click on XenSRV02,\n\n415\n00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:56.646\nnotice I can select to Add it to a pool.\n\n416\n00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:59.032\nAnd that's how easy it really is.\n\n417\n00:23:59.032 --> 00:24:01.719\nOnce I select that,\nif I had multiple pools,\n\n418\n00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:04.640\nI could actually tell it\nwhat pool to add it in to.\n\n419\n00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.090\nIf I wanted to create another\none on my own, I could do that.\n\n420\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.260\nSo I'm going to select itprotvdemo.\n\n421\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.160\nAnd this one is, that's why.\n\n422\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.980\nThere you go.\n\n423\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.940\nSo this is a great thing.\n\n424\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.470\nI know that this sounds silly, but the\nfiling service could not be added in, and\n\n425\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.800\nit says the reason is that\nthis server has running VMs.\n\n426\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.830\nSo if this is your first time doing it and\n\n427\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.260\nyou're like, that's right,\nthose VMs are running.\n\n428\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.770\nI can select this shut down button and\nbecause I have the Zentools installed,\n\n429\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.740\nnotice it's going through its\nprocess of shutting everything down.\n\n430\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.700\nAnd I can do the same thing here\non this shutdown for this VM and\n\n431\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.500\nwe just wait and you'll notice the colors\nit goes to yellow and then it goes to red\n\n432\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.900\nwhen everything is done shutting\ndown the way that it needs to.\n\n433\n00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.865\nNow that everything is red,\nlet's go back in,\n\n434\n00:24:54.865 --> 00:24:58.475\nright click and add it to the pool.\n\n435\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.820\nAnd this is where we're\ngetting that warning now.\n\n436\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.610\nOkay, when I told you it couldn't do\neverything, if everything was identical,\n\n437\n00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.800\nwe wouldn't be having this message here.\n\n438\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.490\nSo as you're attempting to add XENSRV02\nto a pool that's using an older CPU.\n\n439\n00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.110\nNow they're both i5s.\n\n440\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.240\nOkay, I know because I checked\na little bit earlier here.\n\n441\n00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.470\nBut at this point it’s\ntelling you something.\n\n442\n00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.340\nVM running in the pool will\nonly use the CPU features\n\n443\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.540\ncommon to all the servers in the pool.\n\n444\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.760\nXENSRV02 is running on\na newer core i5 processor\n\n445\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:40.370\nthat also has that graphics utility\nbuilt-in to the actual CPU itself.\n\n446\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.710\nSo it's saying, guess what's\nnot gonna be available Ronnie?\n\n447\n00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.530\nThat particular graphics\nutility that it wants to use.\n\n448\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.680\nI can tell it to proceed.\n\n449\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.760\nAnd now once I do you can now see\nwhere it's adding in XENSRV02.\n\n450\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.680\nNow it has this red dot that\ntells us it's not really ready,\n\n451\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.270\nand you see it with the little read slash,\nor the white slash through it.\n\n452\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.930\nBut both of them are now registered\nunderneath this ITProTV demo\n\n453\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.000\npool at this point and\nit's beginning to get us processed.\n\n454\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.200\nYou can see now where the color red turn\nblue just for a moment very quickly.\n\n455\n00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.950\nGetting ready and\nnow it says as a part of the pool.\n\n456\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.510\nNow, you're saying, big deal,\n\n457\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.500\nI don't see why that's actually something\nthat I have to worry about here.\n\n458\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.170\nBut you can kind of see, where now,\nif I select ITProTVDemo,\n\n459\n00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.770\nnotice I get the general.\n\n460\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.290\nThe memory now, notice this is actually\ndistributed between those two.\n\n461\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.480\nStorage that's available.\n\n462\n00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.160\nNetworking, this is where we can add\nin our networks to make them work and\n\n463\n00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.670\nthey even added in this\nGPU if I had it available.\n\n464\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.470\nHigh availability clustering which\nis normally what we wanted to do and\n\n465\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.500\nwhen we cluster things together.\n\n466\n00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.660\nAnd of course Users, you name it, but\n\n467\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.010\nnow I can manage them instead of\nhaving to going each Xen Server.\n\n468\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.750\nI can manage them from this\ntop hierarchy right here.\n\n469\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.130\nAnd it gives me that ability\nto manage both of them and\n\n470\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.250\nset them up the way that we need to.\n\n471\n00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.170\nThere's still a lot more for us to do,\n\n472\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.840\nbut at least right here\nwe get the start of it.\n\n473\n00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.840\nCool, now, you talk about managing,\nRonnie is there\n\n474\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.840\nan option here where I could also set\nup something like an active/passive\n\n475\n00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.550\nconfiguration if I wanted to add\nadditional machines to my pool.\n\n476\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.050\nSo that in case I had any kind of\nhardware failure, something like that?\n\n477\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.200\nWell when we get into the networking side,\nwe definitely will have that.\n\n478\n00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.350\nWhen we get into high availability,\n\n479\n00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.160\nwe'll definitely have the ability to\ndo something like that right now.\n\n480\n00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.080\nBut we've just set up a simple\ncluster at this point.\n\n481\n00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.200\nWe still need to go in to a little bit of\nthat idea of high availability set up.\n\n482\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.670\nOkay.\nBut we still lot more for\n\n483\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.360\nus to set up as well but at this point\nI believe I'm running pretty close and\n\n484\n00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.765\npretty low on time here.\n\n485\n00:27:49.765 --> 00:27:54.860\n[LAUGH] Remember that I didn't attach\nus to the iSCSI storage again.\n\n486\n00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.630\nSo we still need do that.\n\n487\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.450\nOkay.\nWe still need to configure our NICS\n\n488\n00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.300\nto make sure they work\nthe way that we need them to.\n\n489\n00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.590\nAnd so we still also need to configure\nthe idea of basic high availability,\n\n490\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.180\nwhich is something we definitely\nwant to get into as well.\n\n491\n00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.340\nBut at least here, you can see that\neven if you haven't had much experience\n\n492\n00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.740\nin putting them together,\nit's fairly easy at this point.\n\n493\n00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.573\nAnd now all we have to do is we\nhave to go back with the tools and\n\n494\n00:28:17.573 --> 00:28:20.720\ntechniques that we have learned\nbefore about adding in storage.\n\n495\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.979\nAbout the ability to do\nthat storage repository and\n\n496\n00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:27.970\nas well as taking a look at\nhow to configure these things.\n\n497\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:32.030\nWell now we can do that and we'll actually\nsee that, let's say in the next episode,\n\n498\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:32.560\nthat's what I will say.\n\n499\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.760\nI know, it sounds like we have a lot\nto cover but that's okay because\n\n500\n00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.440\nwe're gonna be here so we're hoping\nyou'll join us for the next series here.\n\n501\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.250\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n502\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.310\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n503\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.130\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n504\n00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.744\nSee you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n505\n00:28:46.744 --> 00:28:52.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n506\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.109\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.919\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n5\n00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.440\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.150\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were able to set up our cluster.\n\n7\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.930\nIn this show, we're really gonna be\nlooking at completing the configuration\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.110\nwithin our cluster.\n\n9\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.910\nSo with us today, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong\nto help us through this process.\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.260\nThank you for joining us.\n\n11\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.410\nhaving me back as we continue on taking\na look at the idea of completing\n\n13\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.050\nthe set up of getting our cluster to\nwork in the way that we want it to.\n\n14\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.072\nSo in the previous episode, we did show\nyou some of the things that you might have\n\n15\n00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:46.896\nto do to prepare for\nclustering the machines together,\n\n16\n00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:49.556\nmaking sure that everything\ngoes the way we want to.\n\n17\n00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:53.560\nAnd there are a couple of things,\nof course, as we did that.\n\n18\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.200\nWe wanted to make sure that\nwe removed any type of\n\n19\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.550\nshared storage that we might already had.\n\n20\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.010\nFor example, when I connected\nto an iscuzzy class on XENSRV01,\n\n21\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.590\nI wanna make sure that I do not connect\nto that as I create the cluster\n\n22\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.845\nbecause I want it tied to the cluster,\nrather than just to XENSRV01.\n\n23\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.890\nIf I had NIC bonding already turned\non on XENSRV01, I wanna make sure\n\n24\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.180\nthat I may remove that before it actually\nmay show up inside the cluster as well.\n\n25\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.247\nNow depending on your configuration and\nhow that works, sometimes I have seen it\n\n26\n00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:31.088\nwhere you could just leave it the way that\nit was and then remove all the network\n\n27\n00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:36.035\nconnections that you have made and then\nput them back in and it works just fine.\n\n28\n00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:39.116\nBut usually the idea here is simple,\nthe best way, of course,\n\n29\n00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:43.249\nis that if you're gonna do something like\nthat, especially with NICs, to make sure\n\n30\n00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.370\nthat you have the same number of NICs in\nthe machines that you are going to do.\n\n31\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.963\nIf not, it may kind of have an issue,\nespecially with NIC bonding,\n\n32\n00:01:50.963 --> 00:01:52.220\nas you do that.\n\n33\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.830\nNow there are some things\nthat I wanna make sure of\n\n34\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.300\nbecause as I look down at my\nnotes from that previous episode,\n\n35\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.210\nI should have mentioned some\nof the requirements as well.\n\n36\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.140\nSo getting it set up to do it is key, but\n\n37\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.550\nthere are some requirements that we\nwant to make sure that we also note too.\n\n38\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.530\nWe went over all\nthe hardware requirements,\n\n39\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.300\nwhich is really what I wanted to get to.\n\n40\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.440\nI did forget about\nthe software requirement.\n\n41\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.690\nIf you're gonna be running XenServer and\nyou're gonna be doing a cluster,\n\n42\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.310\nthe recommendation by XenServer itself is\nmake sure that you are on both the same\n\n43\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.900\nversion, as well as the same patches on\nall the clustering machines together.\n\n44\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.342\nSo you don't want these things to get\nout of line in terms of their patches or\n\n45\n00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:32.916\nnumber.\n\n46\n00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:37.085\nIf you're gonna be running\nXenServer 7.0 on one,\n\n47\n00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.800\nmake sure you run 7.0\non everybody else too.\n\n48\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.519\nDon't try and do 6.5 and 7 or 5,\n6.2 and 7, whatever it might be.\n\n49\n00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.700\nMake sure they're all exactly the same.\n\n50\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.640\nDon't patch one and not patch the other.\n\n51\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.070\nIf you're gonna make sure that\nyou're gonna keep up to date,\n\n52\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.490\nmake sure you patch\nthem both as you do so.\n\n53\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.080\nThe last requirement of this is\nthat when you set up XenServer, and\n\n54\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.170\nyou know you're gonna be\nclustering them together,\n\n55\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.670\nmake sure you point them to the same\nNTP server for time synchronization.\n\n56\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.050\nAnd that is a key element for\nthem to work and\n\n57\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.770\ndo the things that they want to do, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.080\nWithout that element, you may find out\nthat the synchronization of the time\n\n59\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.950\nis off just enough, where it doesn't\ndo everything that it needs to.\n\n60\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.150\nSo, those are some of\nthe software requirements.\n\n61\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.180\nYou don't necessarily have to\ndo that inside of XenCenter,\n\n62\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.480\nremember that you still have access to the\nconsole on the XenServers themselves, and\n\n63\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.200\nyou can go in and\nset the NTP server that you want to.\n\n64\n00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.020\nBut you want the time\nsynchronization to be identical\n\n65\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.820\nbetween everybody in those\nclusters that you want, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.860\nSo those are all key elements and\ncritical elements\n\n67\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.850\nthat also need to be included in when\nyou are setting up that cluster.\n\n68\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.230\nAnd it was just elements I forgot, so\n\n69\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.390\nI added them in here on this particular\npart two of the show as well, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.628\nNow let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the XenCenter once again.\n\n71\n00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:04.140\nAnd I wann point out a few other things\nafter creating the basic cluster that\n\n72\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.810\nwe saw up here in\nthe upper left hand corner.\n\n73\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.549\nSo my cluster,\nI just named itprotvdemo, and\n\n74\n00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.723\nboth of these servers are now\ninside of that cluster.\n\n75\n00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:18.372\nBut we don't really have everything set up\nto make sure they're working together as\n\n76\n00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:19.880\na cluster yet.\n\n77\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.043\nBut before I do so, I also wanted to\nshow you that there is a notification.\n\n78\n00:04:26.043 --> 00:04:30.173\nThese are essentially the logs\nthat we have for our XenCenter and\n\n79\n00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.940\nfor everything else that's connecting.\n\n80\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.910\nAnd right now, I have two additional\nerror messages that are available.\n\n81\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.880\nSo I wanna take a look\nat those just briefly,\n\n82\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.000\nthere are two events that are errors,\nand you can see them.\n\n83\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.640\nBut this is what you want to check out,\n\n84\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.710\nespecially when you set up\nthe cluster right at the beginning.\n\n85\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.580\nYou can see, everything that\nit ended up doing to make sure\n\n86\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.470\nthat it was coming up\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n87\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.006\nSo, before this point in time,\nI'm looking here at server and\n\n88\n00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:01.551\npull in the second column.\n\n89\n00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:06.593\nI can see that nothing was done, but\nthen there comes a point when you start\n\n90\n00:05:06.593 --> 00:05:11.391\nnow seeing what was itprotv-demo,\nwhich is the name of our cluster,\n\n91\n00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:17.035\nit starts to get some notes here that\nsays, hey, this is underneath the cluster.\n\n92\n00:05:17.035 --> 00:05:21.537\nAnd it says it's changing memory settings,\nit's creating a new virtual network\n\n93\n00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:25.713\ninterface, it's deleting the old\nvirtual interface, it's doing this,\n\n94\n00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:28.153\nit's scanning for the ones that are there.\n\n95\n00:05:28.153 --> 00:05:32.720\nAnd you start seeing, well, some different\nthings that are now coming online.\n\n96\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.400\nAnd it tried to start a machine here,\nand it didn't like starting there.\n\n97\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.180\nSaid the DVD drive ROM is empty.\n\n98\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.980\nSo you wanna check these out, make sure\nyou have a ton of glaring errors that\n\n99\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.832\nhaven't been taken care of\nas you continue through.\n\n100\n00:05:47.832 --> 00:05:51.670\nAll right, once that's done, that's fine,\n\n101\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.770\nnow we need to configure some of those\nother things that we were talking about.\n\n102\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.789\nRight now, even though I have both of\nthese machines set up that look pretty\n\n103\n00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.340\nmuch exactly the same, I want to\nnow attach some shared resources.\n\n104\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.811\nAnd let's take for an example now\nthat I know that in the future,\n\n105\n00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.628\nI am going to be adding in additional\nXenServers in the future as well.\n\n106\n00:06:12.628 --> 00:06:18.310\nI know I'm gonna be creating\nVMs on those XenServers too.\n\n107\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.940\nBut if I do so, I wanna make sure\nthat they have access to my pool or\n\n108\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.910\nmy storage of all of my ISOs\nthat I had available before.\n\n109\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.380\nWell notice that I don't have the ISO\nstorage that I have set up on XENSRV01,\n\n110\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.620\nnor is it on 02, where before I had\nadded them in there individually\n\n111\n00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.230\nbecause I had them on a shared storage,\na siphs here, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.380\nSo let's add in an additional storage\nagain, and we'll do two of them.\n\n113\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.247\nWe'll do the iscuzzysan, and then we'll\nalso go in and we'll set up this siph too.\n\n114\n00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:56.300\nSo I'm gonna click on New Storage.\n\n115\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.430\nWhen I do this,\nI'm going to select the ISO library first.\n\n116\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.962\nI'm gonna select this Windows File Sharing\n(SMB/CIF) to help us, click Next.\n\n117\n00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:13.370\nThen I'm gonna make this my ISO library,\nclick Next.\n\n118\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.728\nFrom here, the Share Name.\n\n119\n00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.872\nThen I have to give it credentials\nto be able to get access in.\n\n120\n00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:37.293\nSo unless I misspelled something,\nwhich is very possible, my typing skills\n\n121\n00:07:37.293 --> 00:07:42.790\nare not the best, [LAUGH] I'm gonna\nclick Finish, well, maybe, click Finish.\n\n122\n00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.849\nNow when we see it in the end here,\nnotice how ISO library is\n\n123\n00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.805\nnow attached to, well,\nthe pool itself or the cluster,\n\n124\n00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:58.299\nrather than to the individual\nXenServers themselves, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:58.299 --> 00:08:00.271\nSo I can click on Xenserv01 and\n\n126\n00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.990\nI can see where it now has\naccess to the ISO library.\n\n127\n00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.650\nSame thing for Xenserv02 under storage,\nI can see it still has access.\n\n128\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.600\nEven though it's actually\nnow in the pool and\n\n129\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.230\nnot necessarily underneath the command\nof any one of these Xenservers.\n\n130\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.510\nSo that is one of them.\n\n131\n00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.960\nIf I know that in the future\nI'm gonna be adding this in,\n\n132\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.100\nif I add in a new Xenserver into the pool,\n\n133\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.600\nthey'll also get this without\nme having to configure it again.\n\n134\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.010\nSo it's kind of neat.\n\n135\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.280\nThe other one is that iScuzi San\nthat we were talking about too.\n\n136\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.410\nWe wanna do the same thing.\n\n137\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.713\nI'm gonna select ITVPro.TV demo.\n\n138\n00:08:35.713 --> 00:08:40.720\nRight-click and go to new SR for\nstored repository.\n\n139\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.040\nIt is the ISCI storage device that\nwe were talking about earlier.\n\n140\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.155\nSo I'm gonna click on ISCI,\nselect Next, and\n\n141\n00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:56.698\nI will call this one itprotvdemo,\nand we'll do -storage.\n\n142\n00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:58.673\nAnd we'll add in a number 01 here.\n\n143\n00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:03.538\nI may add in additional\nstorage pulls later on or\n\n144\n00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:09.386\nstorage devices later on so\nI'm gonna just add in a 01.\n\n145\n00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:16.138\nThe target,\nIs gonna be the same thing, scan for\n\n146\n00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:21.940\nthe target host, select the one that I\nhad chosen with the same IP address.\n\n147\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.480\nThen it's gonna look for the LUN, okay?\n\n148\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.970\nThe LUN is essentially the hard drive or\nthe stripe that I have created there.\n\n149\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.870\nAnd this one only has one so\nthat helps us out.\n\n150\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.150\n&gt;&gt; Logical unit number.\n\n151\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep, logical unit.\n\n152\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.600\nVery good.\n\n153\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.880\nGoing back to your ISCSI, or\nyour SCSI terminology there.\n\n154\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.400\nCreating LUNs, that's right.\n\n155\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.850\nNow, it's gonna say hey,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n156\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.920\nBecause this was attached to\nsomething a little bit earlier.\n\n157\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.830\nThat's perfectly fine,\nI'm gonna even tell it to format it again.\n\n158\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.553\nNow, remember that what I just did right,\nif that one machine\n\n159\n00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:05.592\nover here that I had said I moved over\nto that LUN now, I just formatted it.\n\n160\n00:10:05.592 --> 00:10:06.361\nIt may be gone,\n\n161\n00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:10.220\nso it is very possible that I just\ndamaged that machine and it does happen.\n\n162\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.755\nThat's why you need to pay attention to\nthese different warnings that come up.\n\n163\n00:10:15.755 --> 00:10:18.680\nDon't do like I just did,\nthat's what I'm trying to let you know.\n\n164\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.230\nNotice now over on the left-hand\nside in the navigation area,\n\n165\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:30.550\nI now have access to that entire\nstorage array that I have available.\n\n166\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.790\nI have my ISO library.\n\n167\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.160\nClick on Storage, and\nyou can see where it's populated that.\n\n168\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.590\nRemember, I wiped this one out, so\nwhatever possibility that I had there of\n\n169\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.730\nthat machine being up and running,\nit may no longer be there.\n\n170\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.070\nNow, let me kind of go backward\nin time just a moment, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.370\nEverything that I've just shown you,\n\n172\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.740\nat least up into this point right here,\nokay, it would've been ideal for\n\n173\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.524\nus to set this up first,\nbefore having a single Xenserver and\n\n174\n00:11:01.524 --> 00:11:06.620\nthen adding in your virtual machines and\nattaching the storage the way that we did.\n\n175\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.130\nIf you know that this is\na possibility in your future,\n\n176\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.970\nthis is what you want to do first\nif you at all possibly can.\n\n177\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.930\nSo even if you go I'm not\nreally using it right now.\n\n178\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.428\nI'm know I'm gonna be using\nit in the future, well,\n\n179\n00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:20.645\nyou'd have to set it up\nthe way that I told you but\n\n180\n00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:23.723\nyou'd want to make sure that you\nkeep that in mind for the future.\n\n181\n00:11:23.723 --> 00:11:27.260\nAnd go all right, here's what I need\nto do once I get to that point.\n\n182\n00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.847\nBut if you're not, if you go all right,\nhere's what I wanna do.\n\n183\n00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:34.349\nI wanna build my VMs, but if I know\nI'm gonna be clustering in the future,\n\n184\n00:11:34.349 --> 00:11:39.218\nyou definitely want to build them with\nthe VDI inside of using that iSCSI storage\n\n185\n00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:40.490\ninstead.\n\n186\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.400\nBecause that's gonna be very helpful.\n\n187\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.380\nAt this point in time for us to make\nsure that we get everything over here,\n\n188\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.910\nwe have to transfer it, but remember\nthat we're not transferring this from\n\n189\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.838\none hard drive letter to another hard\ndrive letter on the same machine.\n\n190\n00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:57.404\nWe're now gonna be sending this\nacross into the switch itself, and\n\n191\n00:11:57.404 --> 00:11:59.978\ninto that device and have a lot of VMs.\n\n192\n00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:04.141\nIt could take a bit of time before it\nactually transfers over and especially in\n\n193\n00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:08.499\nthis situation, this test network\nenvironment, I didn't actually configure\n\n194\n00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:13.860\nanything for optimization, or efficiency,\nor high utilization, or performance here.\n\n195\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.480\nThis is just on our regular network and\n\n196\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.740\neven though it's going through a switch\nand it's not hitting anything else,\n\n197\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.670\nat the same time, it's not optimized\nto do everything that we want it to do.\n\n198\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.670\nSo it still takes time to be able\nto run something over there.\n\n199\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.540\nSo let's see if this one\nactually is gonna be there.\n\n200\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.032\nI'm starting to see something here.\n\n201\n00:12:35.032 --> 00:12:38.240\nThat one may not actually have, yeah.\n\n202\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.420\nSo I have actually lost the hard drive on\nthis one cuz I was trying to show you how\n\n203\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.220\nto just create that attachment here.\n\n204\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.060\nBut for us, let's see.\n\n205\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.288\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\nSo Ronnie says do as Ronnie says,\n\n206\n00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:48.412\nnot as Ronnie does.\n\n207\n00:12:48.412 --> 00:12:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, please don't do that.\n\n208\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.860\nPlease don't do that.\n\n209\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.080\n&gt;&gt; So this time,\nlet's see if I can export this.\n\n210\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.629\nAnd we will export this\nparticular one into,\n\n211\n00:13:01.288 --> 00:13:03.589\nI don't need to export\nit to that location.\n\n212\n00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:05.230\nLet's see if I can find it.\n\n213\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.580\nNope, that's not what I was\nexpecting to find there.\n\n214\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.360\nSo at this point, you can export it and\nthen probably import it in, but\n\n215\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.610\nI think I was just not patient enough\nwhen I chose to try and move this here.\n\n216\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.557\nWe'll try this one again.\n\n217\n00:13:18.557 --> 00:13:22.920\nLet me try this one again here and\nmove it.\n\n218\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.174\nChoose the destination.\n\n219\n00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.661\nAnd now, I don't have to assign a home\nserver on this one if I don't want to\n\n220\n00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:40.955\ncuz now I have a pool where it says let\nme assign it if I choose to instead.\n\n221\n00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:42.240\nSo I have this sign it.\n\n222\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.860\nI can click here and now it's gonna\nsay where do you wanna put it?\n\n223\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.320\nWhich should be right there.\n\n224\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.450\nClick Next and then click Finish.\n\n225\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.900\nAnd over in the lower-right hand corner,\nif you'll full-screen this for a moment,\n\n226\n00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.270\nthat will help us out,\nnotice it's just taking its sweet time.\n\n227\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.998\nAnd that was something I get impatient.\n\n228\n00:13:59.998 --> 00:14:00.613\nI really do.\n\n229\n00:14:00.613 --> 00:14:04.564\nI don't wanna spend anymore time than\nI have to, especially when we're\n\n230\n00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:08.450\nhere trying to talk to make sure\nwe understand what's going on.\n\n231\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.661\nBut it does take a little bit of time to\nmove over because this is not optimized\n\n232\n00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:12.424\nfor the network.\n\n233\n00:14:12.424 --> 00:14:15.692\nIf you had an optimized drive or\nif you were using fiber channel,\n\n234\n00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:18.490\nit probably would've moved very quickly.\n\n235\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.586\nBut at this point, that's what you'd\nhave to do is every single one of these\n\n236\n00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:26.554\nmachines, you wanna move over into\nthat particular storage appliance,\n\n237\n00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:29.115\nget it all set up and\ndone the way that we want to.\n\n238\n00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:34.624\nNow, once that's done, okay, and\neverything is over that is completed, then\n\n239\n00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:39.830\nwe can start it, verify that it works,\nwhich is what you wanna have happen.\n\n240\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.490\nSo it's just gonna take a little\nbit of time for us to do that.\n\n241\n00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.630\nBut before we do that, and while it's\ndoing it, we're gonna also go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.037\nat least show you the steps to\nsetting up for high availability.\n\n243\n00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:54.710\nCuz that's really what\nwe wanna get access to.\n\n244\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.410\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n245\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.080\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to high\navailability, this is that ability for\n\n246\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.450\nus to really have the network\ncontinue to go unnoticed.\n\n247\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.840\nEven in a eventually of\na failure of one of our devices.\n\n248\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.010\nNow this means that before\nyou start to even configure,\n\n249\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.780\nthat you've already planned out where\nyour single points of failure or\n\n250\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.490\nand how you've gotten rid of\nthose single points of failure.\n\n251\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.070\nIf you haven't done that yet, setting\nup high availability will still work.\n\n252\n00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.175\nBut at the same time,\n\n253\n00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:27.690\nit's something that you haven't\nconsidered the full ramifications.\n\n254\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.410\nSuch as if you forget to do something\nlike let's take for an example\n\n255\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.590\nthat if I want a setup high availability,\nI might have thought about everything.\n\n256\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.330\nI have two servers, right?\n\n257\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.390\nSounds good.\n\n258\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.370\nI now have my storage appliance.\n\n259\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.883\nSounds good.\nIt's third one so I don't have to worry\n\n260\n00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:46.110\nabout the local hard drives on\nthe individual Xenservers themselves.\n\n261\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.920\nEven if one Xenserver now goes down,\n\n262\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.860\nthe other one can take over and\nI can manage it from there.\n\n263\n00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.372\nSo I might have thought about all that.\n\n264\n00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:57.327\nI might have even thought about\nidentically making sure that they were\n\n265\n00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:01.550\nthe same so there's not really a lot of\nProblems with the VMs coming up on one\n\n266\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.708\nserver or another.\n\n267\n00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:05.170\nAll that sounds great.\n\n268\n00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:10.680\nBut what if I thought about everything but\nI only still have one NIC per server.\n\n269\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.350\nWhat I mean is that one NIC\nhas to be able to survive\n\n270\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.800\neverything that we're talking about here\nand still be up an ready to work and\n\n271\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.250\nboot and do everything that we need to.\n\n272\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.390\nSo that still may be your single point of\nfailure where you didn't think about it.\n\n273\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.140\n&gt;&gt; No joke, Ronnie.\n\n274\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.230\nThere's a ton of to think about when\nwe're talking about continuity within our\n\n275\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.130\nenvironments.\n\n276\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.540\nBut that really is what's going to set you\napart if you can identify those things and\n\n277\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.890\nbe prepared.\n\n278\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.350\nSo be a little more proactive\ninstead of reactive.\n\n279\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:42.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this does come into\nthe necessary nature of planning of this.\n\n280\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.320\nXen server has the tools to make,\nthe ability to change from just a simple\n\n281\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.040\ncluster like what we showed you,\nto high availability fairly easily.\n\n282\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.580\nOkay?\n\n283\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.215\nBut it can't think of the stuff\nthat you have missed.\n\n284\n00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:55.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It can't sort of then go hey,\n\n285\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.330\nyou didn't consider this.\n\n286\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.090\nDon't get me wrong, it might ask you.\n\n287\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.770\nBut sometimes, these are things in which\nyou should kind of check mark through and\n\n288\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.200\ngo, all right, what can I do to\nmake sure that this thing works?\n\n289\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.870\nOkay, so that's where the key of\nit really does come into the to\n\n290\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.060\nthe properties of everything\nthat we actually have to do.\n\n291\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.730\nWhen we start to consider this\nidea of high availability.\n\n292\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.970\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n293\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.550\nshow you what we would have to\ndo to set up high availability.\n\n294\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.270\nIt's really not difficult.\n\n295\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.270\nIf I click back up here\non the cluster itself.\n\n296\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.610\nLet me check on this machine and\nsee if this is done.\n\n297\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.930\nThis one may actually be done.\n\n298\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.850\nI don't want to turn it on yet,\n\n299\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.170\nbut we'll see here in just\na little bit of time, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.640\nSo, I just clicked back up here.\n\n301\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.510\nI just wanted to check,\n\n302\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.400\ncause now I'm looking, I'm like,\nI wonder if it's still going.\n\n303\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.480\nUp here on, of course,\nour pool or the cluster itself.\n\n304\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.110\nThen, I can come over here\ninside of the details.\n\n305\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.985\nSelect the tab labeled as H.A for\nHigh Availability.\n\n306\n00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:59.300\nH.A is currently not enabled for\nthis clustered pool.\n\n307\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.430\nSo it does differentiate\nbetween a cluster and\n\n308\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.768\nwhat we call a high\navailability cluster as well.\n\n309\n00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:12.040\nClick configure H.A to enable H.A for\nthis pool and allow your virtual machines\n\n310\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.650\nto automatically be restarted in\nthe event of an unexpected failure.\n\n311\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.610\nMan, that sounds like magic.\n\n312\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.950\nThat's exactly what we want, right?\n\n313\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.010\nOne host fails,\nthe other machine just takes over.\n\n314\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.980\nThat is the key.\n\n315\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.810\nThat is exactly what we want but\nif you didn't think about some of those\n\n316\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.280\nconsiderations we were talking\nabout at the beginning.\n\n317\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.900\nYou may have thought about everything but\n\n318\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.290\nthe one thing you need to do and I can't\ntell you how many times I've done that.\n\n319\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.680\nBut, you know, you just kind of have\nto make sure that you pay attention.\n\n320\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.800\nSo, what do I do?\n\n321\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.900\nI select configure HA.\n\n322\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.290\nNow this is where you realize whether or\nnot.\n\n323\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.940\nYou have actually considered\neverything for HA.\n\n324\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.940\nIt essentially tells you\nwhat the prerequisites are.\n\n325\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.990\nShared storage must be available,\nincluding at least one, ISCSI.\n\n326\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.640\nWell guess what?\n\n327\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.580\nWe have one ISCSI, so we know that we\nare there and that we are ready to go.\n\n328\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.480\nAnd it even tells you it has to\nbe at least 356MB or greater.\n\n329\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.710\nThis LUN will be used for,\nnotice something else,\n\n330\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.440\nit's called the heartbeat\nstorage repository or SR.\n\n331\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.650\nFor high availability to work, right.\n\n332\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.610\nWe have to be able to send\nmessages back and forth and\n\n333\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.547\nthis is what you were talking about\nearlier is the active-active,\n\n334\n00:19:26.547 --> 00:19:28.560\nactive-passive and stuff like that.\n\n335\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.220\nIt has to be able to do stuff like this,\nokay.\n\n336\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.350\nAll virtual machines you want to\nprotect with HA must be agile.\n\n337\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.720\nBut what the heck does that mean?\n\n338\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.840\nIs it gonna do cartwheels?\n\n339\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.570\nI mean, what does it mean here?\n\n340\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Quick to evolve?\n\n341\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.560\n&gt;&gt; Quick to evolve?\n\n342\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.660\nYeah, it's actually designed to let you\nknow that you gotta be able to move these\n\n343\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.130\nthings fairly quickly,\nis what you want to be able to do.\n\n344\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.760\nWe strongly recommended the use\nof bonded management interfaces\n\n345\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.260\non the server in the pool\nif HA is enabled.\n\n346\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.200\nAnd multi pass storage for the heartbeat.\n\n347\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.140\nRemember I told you that if you\nforget anything, is pried right here.\n\n348\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.890\nWe don't consider because network\nadapters, we just plug the server in and\n\n349\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.110\nwe don't think about.\n\n350\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.750\nBut the great thing is, most the time,\n\n351\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.580\nespecially if you're setting this up in a\nserver environment, most of your networks\n\n352\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.630\nare probably not gonna be configured\nwith just one single NIC.\n\n353\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.570\nMost of them probably will have two\nif not four built directly in so\n\n354\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.130\nthat you can do this.\n\n355\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.820\nThis means that you can bond those\ntwo of four NICs together and\n\n356\n00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.600\nget the bandwidth that you need to.\n\n357\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.070\nYou can use one for\n\n358\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.250\nconfiguration management like\nthey're saying here on your own.\n\n359\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.120\nOr, you can make sure that\nactually works altogether.\n\n360\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.970\nPowered it is, that's what they're saying.\n\n361\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.790\nBut at this point, we're only doing\none and then we'll go back and\n\n362\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.080\nwe'll talk about the idea of bonding\nNICs a little bit later on to.\n\n363\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.830\nSo if you've considered all these,\nit's saying you can proceed forward.\n\n364\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.640\nIf you have it this maybe the time for\n\n365\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.773\nyou to start thinking about that\nidea of getting through here,right?\n\n366\n00:21:02.773 --> 00:21:04.080\nClick Next.\n\n367\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.530\nNow it's scanning 40HA and\nlook it found it So now it's saying hey,\n\n368\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.230\nselect the heartbeat SR that will\nbe used to monitor availability and\n\n369\n00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.610\nhealth of servers in the pool.\n\n370\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.250\nHeartbeat SRs must use shared storage.\n\n371\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.480\nSo they're telling you,\n\n372\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.620\nyou can't do this on a local hard drive\nthat's inside of your server here.\n\n373\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.860\nThis has to be on that third one.\n\n374\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.260\nAnd that's why it really is,\nit';s kinda strange.\n\n375\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.010\nEven though we're setting\nup a cluster of two,\n\n376\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.520\nit really requires three\nmachines to make it work,.\n\n377\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.540\nSo we need that heartbeat, essentially,\nis what this one is doing.\n\n378\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.780\nAnd then we need the other one as well,\nokay?\n\n379\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.475\nClick Next.\n\n380\n00:21:44.948 --> 00:21:47.220\nHA is guaranteed.\n\n381\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.800\nThat's what you want to see, okay.\n\n382\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.400\nSo that's a good one.\n\n383\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.530\nYou have a check mark that says\nhigh availability is guaranteed.\n\n384\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.980\nThe maximum number of failures\nthat HA can protect against at\n\n385\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.590\nthis point in this cluster is one.\n\n386\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.720\nWell, it makes sense.\n\n387\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.700\nIf I have two [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Two Zen servers go down, and I have two\n\n389\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.910\nZen servers, yeah, if HA could protect\nme from that in the Citrix environment.\n\n390\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.241\n&gt;&gt; I think they'd have\ncontrol of the market.\n\n391\n00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:17.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think they would have entirely insane\n\n392\n00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:21.996\ncontrol of the market if they [LAUGH]\ncould protect your virtualization and\n\n393\n00:22:21.996 --> 00:22:23.850\nkeep it working without.\n\n394\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.060\n&gt;&gt; A virtualization host.\n\n395\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.310\n&gt;&gt; Like you said it is magic.\n\n396\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.010\n&gt;&gt; That would be incredibly\nmagical at the same time.\n\n397\n00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.010\nYeah, you'd be living in\nthe land of Harry Potter.\n\n398\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.850\nThat is what you'd be living\nin if you could do that.\n\n399\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.450\nSo now there we go.\n\n400\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.280\nLet's see.\nI'm trying to make sure here.\n\n401\n00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.840\nMake sure what we see here.\n\n402\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.220\nThe other thing that it gives you the\nability to do when you start configuring\n\n403\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.760\nis, notice it gives you a restart\npriority at this point and\n\n404\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.420\na start order if you\nwould choose to set it.\n\n405\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.720\nSo, this is where it's important if you\nhave your network infrastructure set up,\n\n406\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.250\nwe may choose something\nlike our domain controller\n\n407\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.650\nto actually have\nthe initial startup order.\n\n408\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.350\nI don't even know what Let's\nsee how many of them I can go.\n\n409\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.590\nSo it looks like I can.\n\n410\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.650\nYou can continue to go up.\n\n411\n00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.460\nI didn't know how many you\ncould actually set up there.\n\n412\n00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.800\nBut I'm assuming at this point,\n\n413\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.300\nthe lower numbers are essentially\ngoing to be the order here.\n\n414\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.110\nSo if I have four virtual machines,\none, two, three, four,\n\n415\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.240\nthat kind of showed you what\nthe start up order is gonna be.\n\n416\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.110\nYou want to make sure especially in\na Windows environment that those things do\n\n417\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.340\nstart up in the order that they need to.\n\n418\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.040\nBecause you might find out that if they\ndon't you're gonna end up with some\n\n419\n00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.150\nunusual errors that you're gonna have\nto muddle around with until they work.\n\n420\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.920\nWe used to have this happen all\nthe time in teaching exchange classes\n\n421\n00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.850\nwhere students would come.\n\n422\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.000\nAnd they would just start up every\nsingle virtual machine at the same time.\n\n423\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.040\nAnd then,\ntheir exchange server wouldn't connect.\n\n424\n00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.545\nAnd you're like,\ndid you let the domain controller start?\n\n425\n00:23:47.545 --> 00:23:49.280\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, start up.\n\n426\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.270\nI don't know.\n\n427\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.840\nI didn't check.\n\n428\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.662\nI just started them all up.\n\n429\n00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:56.250\nWe finally had to tell them,\nstart up the domain controller first.\n\n430\n00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.200\nLet that thing come to the log on screen\nand then boot up your exchange server.\n\n431\n00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.931\nDid it take longer, yes.\n\n432\n00:24:00.931 --> 00:24:03.908\nBut at the same time even if you\nthought you could try and time or\n\n433\n00:24:03.908 --> 00:24:07.350\nit I'm wanna let it run for\n30 seconds and then boot up.\n\n434\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.160\nIt sounds weird to say that it\ntook longer than 30 seconds for\n\n435\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.760\nthe machine to boot up now.\n\n436\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.240\nServers, it always will i believe but\n\n437\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.790\nregular VMs in today's desktop market,\ndoesn't take it very long at all.\n\n438\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.380\nBut this is where you would select that,\nand\n\n439\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.110\nof course you would want\nto choose that start up.\n\n440\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.810\nNotice, you can even set it to\nthe point where you say don't restart\n\n441\n00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.780\nthings if you don't want to and\nattempt to start once again.\n\n442\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.330\nThere are very many different\nobjects that you have,\n\n443\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.930\nI'm not gonna worry about\nsetting these up so much.\n\n444\n00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.400\nBut do note that you have\nthe ability to do so.\n\n445\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.630\nAt that point Finish.\n\n446\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.670\nAnd I just click Finish.\n\n447\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.150\nAnd now it's currently being enabled.\n\n448\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.040\nAnd in the lower right hand corner\nof the screen this is where it gets\n\n449\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.620\nfrustrating again.\n\n450\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.760\nThis is one of those unusual ones.\n\n451\n00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.020\nIt looks like it went fast.\n\n452\n00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.500\nIt just jumped from 10% over\nto almost 40% right away.\n\n453\n00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.120\nI'm like, yes,\nthis is gonna take about 30 seconds.\n\n454\n00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.245\nThis is where it kind of, all of a sudden,\nabout 40% to 50%, it slows down.\n\n455\n00:25:06.245 --> 00:25:12.210\n[LAUGH] And then it just takes a bit of\ntime before it actually catches up, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:17.020\nSo if you're like me, that's one of the\nfrustrating things where I don't know why\n\n457\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.560\nit gives you that much hope,\nbrings you about halfway and then is like,\n\n458\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.380\nI'm now going to start to slowly configure\nand do everything else that we need to.\n\n459\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.540\nBut the great thing is,\nthrough the magic of television here,\n\n460\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.510\nwe have this ability to speed up time\nin what we're actually monitoring here.\n\n461\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.180\nAnd what we're gonna is allow\nthat to happen right now.\n\n462\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.950\nAll right, irony has just happened.\n\n463\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:47.390\nAs soon as I said that, it actually\ndid finish exactly at that moment,\n\n464\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.180\nor not too long after that moment.\n\n465\n00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.060\nI thought it was gonna take probably about\nten more minutes here, but overall though,\n\n466\n00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.400\nlet's take a look at what we see now as\neverything has now finished up the way\n\n467\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:03.910\nthat it wants and says HA is currently\nenabled for the ITProTV demo.\n\n468\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.140\nSo I know it's there.\n\n469\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.980\nNotice the configuration, it is enabled.\n\n470\n00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.790\nThe capacity for failure again is kind\nof right there, it kind of tells you.\n\n471\n00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.860\nWhat may kind of scare you right here at\nthe beginning, which kind of got me for\n\n472\n00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.830\na moment just 30 seconds ago.\n\n473\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.160\nIs that even though it said\nthe storage is healthy,\n\n474\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.550\nboth of those servers\ncan gain access to it.\n\n475\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:28.310\nThe network was showing an error,\nand just as we rolled the cameras,\n\n476\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.830\nit switched over from error to healthy.\n\n477\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.020\nSo everything now inside of my\npool is pretty much healthy, here.\n\n478\n00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.800\nAnd if we go back into,\n\n479\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.130\nlet's say, I'm trying to look\nat this couple of things here.\n\n480\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.290\nGPU looks good.\n\n481\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.840\nUsers.\n\n482\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.700\nSo now here is just the general set up\non the pool that we have available.\n\n483\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.670\nLet's see if I can start up one.\n\n484\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.021\nSo I'm gonna select\nthe ITProTvDemoWebServer01 and\n\n485\n00:27:00.021 --> 00:27:05.130\nstart that VM and now that\n\n486\n00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.345\nVM should be started up I'm gonna go to\nXen server 02 here and also start that VM.\n\n487\n00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:15.960\nXenServer01 or the live Linux test machine\nI know I deleted the hard drive of for\n\n488\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.990\nthat one, that was me so\nI don't want to start that one up.\n\n489\n00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.980\nBut now all three of these\nVMs are starting up and\n\n490\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.680\nthey're now starting up on\nthat shared storage as well.\n\n491\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:32.010\nAnd this allows us now to have that\nhigh availability cluster set up.\n\n492\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.530\nThe only other thing for us right.\n\n493\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.830\nNow as everything is on and moving is\nto kind of test and see whether or\n\n494\n00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.330\nnot this is working.\n\n495\n00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:47.560\nSo if I've set up everything the way that\nit's supposed to be set up, now we have to\n\n496\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.280\ngo ahead and see if everything is going\nto work in terms of high availability.\n\n497\n00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.000\nSo it says it protects be from what?\n\n498\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.610\n&gt;&gt; One failure, yeah.\n\n499\n00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.550\n&gt;&gt; The failure of one machine, okay.\n\n500\n00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.240\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, so\nwe're gonna kill it to test this machine?\n\n501\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Well I would, except that we're really\nclose to being out of time at this point.\n\n502\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.730\nSo let's go ahead and do this, we'll take\na break now, and then when we come back\n\n503\n00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.270\nwe'll see how we can I test it out and\nsee how it actually ends up working.\n\n504\n00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n505\n00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.660\nBecause, we are short on time, so let's go\nahead and wrap up this particular show.\n\n506\n00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.330\nBut, stay tuned, like Ronnie said,\nwe'll go ahead and keep on trucking.\n\n507\n00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.660\nSo, grab your popcorn, but\nwe're go ahead and sign off for this show.\n\n508\n00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.610\nRemember I'm show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n509\n00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.124\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n510\n00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:30.961\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n511\n00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:36.974\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:28:36.974 --> 00:28:40.000\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.086\nWelcome to your Citrix XenServer show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.152\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:20.550\nThis is actually continuation\nwhere we've made it to part three.\n\n6\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.600\nIn the last episode we were just\nabout to test our high availability\n\n7\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.000\nby powering down a machine, so\nthat's where we'll pick up here today.\n\n8\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.210\nAnd in studios we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong to help us with this.\n\n9\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.070\nWhat also will we be\nlooking at today Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down to it,\n\n11\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.380\nwe do have to test out our XenServer\ncapabilities and high availability.\n\n12\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.130\nWe also need to take a look at a little\nbit of other configurations that we can\n\n13\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.220\ncluster together.\n\n14\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.950\nThe idea here, of course,\nis talking about that NICs, right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.797\nThe ability to do what we'll\ncall NIC bonding or NIC teaming,\n\n16\n00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:52.570\nyou might have heard of\nboth those terms before.\n\n17\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.710\nWe can do that also in Citrix XenServer.\n\n18\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.580\nThe neat thing about everything that we've\ndone so far that's really, I think is\n\n19\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.920\npretty great of Citrix, is that it doesn't\nrequire extra money for us to do this.\n\n20\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.600\nEven with the standard edition of Citrix\nXenServer, we can do high availability.\n\n21\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000\nWe didn't have to buy\nan additional license to do it.\n\n22\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.820\nIt will support up to 16 of them,\n\n23\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.150\nand we still don't have to worry about\nthe idea of additional licensing.\n\n24\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.870\nSo we can cluster,\nwe can set up high availability, and\n\n25\n00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.860\nit's not any extra cost, lowering that\nidea of the total cost of ownership for\n\n26\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.570\nevery company, and\nthat's what they hope to do.\n\n27\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.920\nSo let's pick up where we\nleft off last time here.\n\n28\n00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.530\nWe were about to test out our\nCitrix XenServer in the high\n\n29\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.890\navailability cluster.\n\n30\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.960\nLet's take a look at our setup\nright here on my machine.\n\n31\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.750\nSo here's pretty much where we left off.\n\n32\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.419\nNow the only thing that I've done in the\nmeantime is that in the previous episode\n\n33\n00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:49.510\nyou'll notice that I only ended\nup having only three BMs working.\n\n34\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.287\nSo again, that was because previous to\nthat, in another episode before that,\n\n35\n00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:58.030\nI ended up deleting out\nthe virtual machine hard drive.\n\n36\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.740\nI didn't intend to do that, but I didn't\nwant to wait and try and restore it.\n\n37\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.750\nSo I said that was fine, I'll build\nanother virtual machine later on.\n\n38\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.690\nSo now on each one of my\nXenServers in this cluster,\n\n39\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.040\nI have two machines operating and\nready to go in our test.\n\n40\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.110\nNow there are a couple of things that\nwe need to make sure that we can do\n\n41\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.020\nbefore we make this test happen.\n\n42\n00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.970\nIdeally, what we would have, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.730\nis both machines have the same\namount of RAM and, of course,\n\n44\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.260\neverything's identical and we've already\nemphasized that over and over again.\n\n45\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.040\nBut, it's to have more RAM\nthat's available as well.\n\n46\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.706\nNow, what I mean by that is you wanna make\nsure that you have more than enough RAM\n\n47\n00:02:36.706 --> 00:02:40.008\nfor the machines that you think,\nin your high availability cluster.\n\n48\n00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:44.890\nIf they get brought down, that they can\nload up and operate on another machine.\n\n49\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460\nSo let me give you a for\ninstance here before we go on.\n\n50\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.780\nFor example, XENSRV01, right here.\n\n51\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.450\nIf I take a look at the memory capacity,\n\n52\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.450\nI can see that it really\nhas eight gigs of RAM.\n\n53\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.860\nCurrently, I'm using about six gigs of it,\nand seven gigs altogether.\n\n54\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.340\nIf you take a look at the way that\nthis has been allocated so far.\n\n55\n00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.500\nAnd, that actually leaves me with really\nnot a lot that's left here, right?\n\n56\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.760\nSo right about three gigs\nis all that I have left.\n\n57\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.570\nNow, this could present a problem.\n\n58\n00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.110\nIf I take XENSRV02 down,\nwell I may not have accounted for\n\n59\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.500\nboth of these machines in terms\nof the ability to recover.\n\n60\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.060\nFor instance, if the CentOS minimal\ninstall that you see on the left\n\n61\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.470\nhand side here, let's say that for\ninstance takes up a gig of RAM.\n\n62\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.615\nWell, that now goes to seven gigs that\nI'm taking up, and then I add in this\n\n63\n00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:44.590\nitprotvdemo-websrv02, which I know\nis a Windows Server 2012 machine.\n\n64\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.400\nAnd now let's say that I put it at the\nbare minimum that thought it could run,\n\n65\n00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.020\nwhich was 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n66\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.900\nWell I would have to account for\nthat on running on XENSRV01 as well.\n\n67\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.490\nSo when it takes a look then,\nif I add up just the bare minimums, right?\n\n68\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.200\nWe're talking about adding in\nan extra three gigs of ram.\n\n69\n00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.970\nAnd starting up.\n\n70\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.650\nAnd now, if I take a look at\nXENSRV01's capacity here,\n\n71\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.650\nwell if I go to three gigs,\nthat thing is probably not going to run.\n\n72\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.900\nIt may run,\nI'm not gonna say it can't run.\n\n73\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.964\nI've actually been able to do this where\nthe free amount of memory that was left,\n\n74\n00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:23.990\nCherokee, on one of these machines\nwas like 128 megs of RAM.\n\n75\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.614\nAnd that Citrix XenServer\nworked perfectly fine, but\n\n76\n00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.630\nthat was just a standalone environment.\n\n77\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.180\nIn the high of availability here,\nif XENSRV02 goes down, and\n\n78\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.780\nthese two machines have\nto be able to come up.\n\n79\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.279\nProbably at this point only one,\n[CROSSTALK] yeah, maybe one, maybe none,\n\n80\n00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.887\nit just depends on how this\nmachine has actually allocated.\n\n81\n00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:45.660\nI've gotta think here, right?\n\n82\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.160\nThat if I didn't allocate it for being\nthat static RAM that we talked about,\n\n83\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.010\ninstead of dynamic, then it could be that\n\n84\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.300\nthis is right on the edge of actually\nright there at the max of whatever it is.\n\n85\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.160\nOr, I could be fooling myself if\nI take a look and it says look,\n\n86\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.640\neven though I'm using dynamic RAM\nthat's showing me an extra gig or\n\n87\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.220\ntwo, I may not actually have it.\n\n88\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.720\nSo that's why you have to be careful.\n\n89\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.894\nSo this is what XenServer does\ninstead when it reports it.\n\n90\n00:05:12.894 --> 00:05:17.430\nEven with dynamic RAM,\nwhich I know that if I remember correctly,\n\n91\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.010\nthis ITProTV demo Linux here, I think\nthis is the one that I set for dynamic.\n\n92\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.830\nAnd it may even the be the web servers.\n\n93\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.970\nWell I can't remember.\n\n94\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.860\nBut I do know that this one, I think,\nI had set as dynamic earlier.\n\n95\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.030\nSo in this one,\nthey just reported as look,\n\n96\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.430\nwe're not gonna do this dynamic\nwhen you go to measure it.\n\n97\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.350\nWe're just gonna say hey,\nit's taking up 2 gigs right now.\n\n98\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.290\nSo that way, we don't have this chance\nof accidentally starting the machine up.\n\n99\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.820\nAnd then a machine that was running\nsays ooh, now I need more RAM, so\n\n100\n00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.690\nthat we over allocate as much as possible.\n\n101\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.700\nSo, it really does help us out and\n\n102\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.040\nit makes sure that we're not gonna\ndo anything that we can't have.\n\n103\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.190\nSo, you have to be careful with that,\nso that's what I'm saying,\n\n104\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.500\nis take that into consideration.\n\n105\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Before you start turning off machines\n\n106\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.030\nlike, so\n\n107\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.340\nif I had six virtual machines running on\nXENSRV02, I've got to realize something.\n\n108\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.870\nMore than likely not all\nsix are gonna come up.\n\n109\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.320\nMaybe one,\nmaybe two might be able to come up, but\n\n110\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.310\nthere's no guarantee of that\nuntil you take a look here.\n\n111\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.943\n&gt;&gt; And of course, Ronnie,\n\n112\n00:06:14.943 --> 00:06:17.680\nthat's all contingent upon the hardware\nthat you actually started with.\n\n113\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n114\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.430\nThat's what it is contingent upon.\n\n115\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.824\nSo ideally this would have\nmuch more RAM than 8 gigs, and\n\n116\n00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:26.239\nthe same thing over here on XENSRV02.\n\n117\n00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:27.970\nI would have much more RAM.\n\n118\n00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.940\nAnd you can see where this one though,\n\n119\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.540\nthis is actually no this has taken up\na little bit over four at this point too.\n\n120\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.180\nSo we have that ability\nto be able to see that.\n\n121\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.340\nBut at the same time, we've gotta\nbe careful before we do anything.\n\n122\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n123\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.841\n&gt;&gt; Secondly, there's a couple of\nthings that we have to ensure.\n\n124\n00:06:45.841 --> 00:06:49.189\nNow, that we've got the high\navailability cluster set up, and\n\n125\n00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.620\nwe have that shared storage, right?\n\n126\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.390\nSo, we also created this,\nattached it to the cluster itself.\n\n127\n00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.190\nOr what we call that heterogenous\nresource pool which we do.\n\n128\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.150\nWe wanna make sure that all of our VDIs,\nright?\n\n129\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.570\nOur Virtual Disks are on here.\n\n130\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.940\nSo when you start to take a look,\n\n131\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.180\nyou wanna make sure that all of your VDIs\nare on here and that they are ready to go.\n\n132\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.340\nThe reason why this is important.\n\n133\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.010\nWe talked about the idea of high\navailability clustering, right?\n\n134\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:25.298\nIn theory what should happen, okay, if\nall of those virtual machines are stored\n\n135\n00:07:25.298 --> 00:07:30.998\nhere on the clustered server, that means\nthat if they're running in the background.\n\n136\n00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:36.076\nAnd then if you take away XENSRV02,\nwhat should happen before it\n\n137\n00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:41.526\nshuts down is that it's only copying\nwhat's in the RAM of XENSRV02.\n\n138\n00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:42.225\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n139\n00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:45.762\n&gt;&gt; And it's moving that over to XENSRV01,\nsaying hey,\n\n140\n00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:48.590\nthis is where I want to start up.\n\n141\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:54.213\nBut the hard drive, right, is still\nhere and running on my ISCSI target.\n\n142\n00:07:54.213 --> 00:08:00.060\nAnd that's important, because if I\nshut down XENSRV02, That means what?\n\n143\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.977\nOn the hard drives on\nthe local storage here.\n\n144\n00:08:01.977 --> 00:08:04.250\nThey're still spinning but\nif I shut it down,\n\n145\n00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.940\nthose hard drives are no longer spinning.\n\n146\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.120\nAnd I don't care what high\navailability you have set up.\n\n147\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.110\nYou're not gonna actually get it to\nrestart if you don't have access to\n\n148\n00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.020\nthe hard drives.\n\n149\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.460\nSo in this sense,\nyou have to pay attention to that as well.\n\n150\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.490\nSo, if you check out the storage,\n\n151\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.830\nyou wanna make sure that you don't have\nyour virtual machines running here.\n\n152\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:30.490\nIf you do, then then you just select the\none that want here and the you'd migrate\n\n153\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:37.030\nthat over to your particular storage\nservers that you want to be able to do.\n\n154\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.580\nNow, secondly,\nthirdly I should say, so yeah.\n\n155\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.600\nEven though I thought we'll\njust start this thing up and\n\n156\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.630\njust let it do what it wants to do,\nyou can.\n\n157\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.650\nYou can just shoot the dice and\ngo, all right, here it goes.\n\n158\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.330\nAnd if you're like me you\nprobably put down $100 bill and\n\n159\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.910\nlose it just as quickly,\nif you were to do that.\n\n160\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.020\nBut this is the setup.\n\n161\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.100\n&gt;&gt; It's a fun part, trying it out.\n\n162\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a fun part trying\nit out in a lab environment.\n\n163\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:02.612\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's true.\n\n164\n00:09:02.612 --> 00:09:04.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In a production environment, not so\n\n165\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.050\nfun when things don't come back up,\nI guarantee you.\n\n166\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.250\nIt now becomes a little\nbit of a harder issue.\n\n167\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.020\nAnd I've had this happen before Cherokee,\n\n168\n00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.610\nwhere it's like all right,\nhere's what we wanna do.\n\n169\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.790\nWe want inside of that server we\nwant to place something, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.640\nSo because we believe that let's say that\nthe older NIC that was in it was 100\n\n171\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.990\nmegabit NIC or whatever it was or\nwhatever off brand that,\n\n172\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.740\nwe wanted to move to an Intel NIC.\n\n173\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:38.970\nAnd we replaced that NIC inside of that\nserver by adding in an additional PCIX.\n\n174\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.570\nSlot nick and put that in there.\n\n175\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.880\nWent to try and reboot the server.\n\n176\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.280\nServer didn't even come up.\n\n177\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.420\nIt just didn't even come up, and\n\n178\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.340\nso there you are like all right great\nthing we're in high availability.\n\n179\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.640\nNow my secondary server won't come back up\nso I can bring it back in, and then you\n\n180\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.240\njust spend time troubleshooting and\neverything's now running off of that one.\n\n181\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.040\nMachine so you've gotta be prepared for\nthat and that's great.\n\n182\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.040\nThat's why high availability is there,\nat the same time is you can't\n\n183\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.860\nget the second one to come\nback up you're in trouble.\n\n184\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.590\nIn a production environment\nthat's really bad.\n\n185\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.570\nIn the lab environment you're just kind\nof scratching your head a bit, but\n\n186\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.710\nyou still have to kind of make it work.\n\n187\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.700\nSo that's what I wanted to make sure\nthat we understood here too, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.270\nThe third or fourth, I don't know, which?\n\n189\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.000\nFourth?\nOkay see.\n\n190\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Third episode, fourth topic.\n\n191\n00:10:24.555 --> 00:10:26.286\n&gt;&gt; I know, who knows yeah.\n\n192\n00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:28.571\nSo another prerequisite before you go.\n\n193\n00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.208\nLet's shut down this machine, okay,\nlet's take a look at my machine again and\n\n194\n00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.290\nwe'll point this out to you okay.\n\n195\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.360\nSo on the machines as we now\nlaunch up virtual machines\n\n196\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.540\nIf I right click on one of them,\nI just gonna select for\n\n197\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.390\nexample this sent OS minimal install,\nI go to properties.\n\n198\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.560\nAnd the other one is\na couple of things okay,\n\n199\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.290\non this start up options\nyou want to choose.\n\n200\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.090\nWhat happens in high availability\nif that server fails?\n\n201\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.910\nFor example, here it says high\navailability restart priority.\n\n202\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.140\nHA restart priority.\n\n203\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.350\nIf you select restart, notice it says,\nalways try to restart the VM.\n\n204\n00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.580\nIf I click on that dropdown,\nnotice I can say,\n\n205\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:19.210\nrestart if possible, try to restart\nthe VM if the resources are available.\n\n206\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.870\nSo this probably a safer bet instead\nof just saying let's just run it and\n\n207\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.840\ntry and make it work.\n\n208\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.546\n&gt;&gt; So if we just left restart then it\ncould potentially crash other virtual\n\n209\n00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:31.091\nmachines that are that\nare running on that system\n\n210\n00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.289\n&gt;&gt; If not, right,\n\n211\n00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:37.530\nit just gives you maybe an error and\nit says 'yeah, error something'.\n\n212\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.360\nBut it may not be as specific\nas you want it to be.\n\n213\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.980\nNormally what ends up happening when\nyou try and restart them all and\n\n214\n00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.510\nyou don't have enough resources available,\ninside of the logs you'll end up seeing\n\n215\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.760\nwhere it tells you it can't do it due to\nresources utilization or something, okay.\n\n216\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Which you've got to realize\nthat's something that can happen.\n\n217\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.460\nAnd then of course just do not restart.\n\n218\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.630\nAnd notice it says the VM\nwill not be restarted.\n\n219\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.710\nSo you've got to make sure\nthat you check one of those.\n\n220\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.300\nI'm gonna select for this one because\nthis is the smaller of the two machines,\n\n221\n00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.970\nI'm gonna select restart here.\n\n222\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.510\nAnd then I have one other\noption that I want to select,\n\n223\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.570\nwhich is the idea of the home server.\n\n224\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.510\nThe home server is saying which of these\ntwo machines do I really want this VM to\n\n225\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.920\nstart up on?\n\n226\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.080\nIf I'm inside of that cluster pool I\nmay want to choose this one instead.\n\n227\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.530\nDon't assign this VM to\na particular home server.\n\n228\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.750\nThe VM will be started on any server.\n\n229\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.880\nWith the necessary resources.\n\n230\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.370\nIn high availability, that's gonna\nbe very important for us, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.439\nBecause if you select the one\nthat you just turned off.\n\n232\n00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:42.250\nPlace it on this server.\n\n233\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.830\nAnd I just turned that one off.\n\n234\n00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.390\nIt says, okay, I need to restart.\n\n235\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.820\nWhere's Zen server 02?\n\n236\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.740\nIt's not there, guess what It says,\nI'm probably not gonna start but\n\n237\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.340\nif I select this option, it is saying,\nI don't care which server you start on as\n\n238\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.570\nlong as there are resources available,\nlet me try and start on that one.\n\n239\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.893\nThen, I'm gonna click OK.\n\n240\n00:13:02.893 --> 00:13:07.210\nSo you would go back through each one\nof your virtual machines when you're in\n\n241\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.120\na cluster.\n\n242\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.530\nAnd those are some of the options you\nwant to make sure that you verify.\n\n243\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.450\nSo like this one,\nI already did that earlier as well as\n\n244\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.070\nhere on the start up options.\n\n245\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.370\nThis one I'm just going to leave, because\nI know that this is a Windows machine.\n\n246\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.580\nI know that there's two gigs on it.\n\n247\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.540\nOver on the other one, I know there's one.\n\n248\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.070\nI think that one will start up for us, or\nif not it will wait untill it decides to\n\n249\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.520\ndo something else or\nwe meet the man who installed it.\n\n250\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.550\nIt just depends on some of the different\nthings are set up there, but\n\n251\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.270\nam just gonna say restart if possible.\n\n252\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.850\nYou alright.\n\n253\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.010\nSo know we have that.\n\n254\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.383\nSo remember that it does seem like a law\nthat you have to kind of get checked\n\n255\n00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:49.036\nin to do this, so even though\nthe wizard was easy to set it up,\n\n256\n00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.637\nthere is still a lot for\nyou to think about.\n\n257\n00:13:51.637 --> 00:13:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Go back and configure\n&gt;&gt; And for you to configure.\n\n258\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, it makes sense though,\nbecause I mean, if you did have a failure,\n\n259\n00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.420\nand it didn't restart.\n\n260\n00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.810\nThat's a pretty significant configuration,\nbecause then you could be completely\n\n261\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.170\ndead in the water, and you'll start\nseeing all those tickets come through and\n\n262\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.060\nyou're like hm,\n[LAUGH] I think there was something else.\n\n263\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.150\n&gt;&gt; It does matter, it really does matters.\n\n264\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.540\nSo the great thing is that's why you do it\nin a test enviroment if at all possible.\n\n265\n00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.410\nJust like what we're doing here.\n\n266\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.470\nYou test it out, you try,\nyou make sure that it ends up working.\n\n267\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.390\nYou do everything that you possibly can.\n\n268\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.280\nSo let me check the other two just\nto make sure, and this, of course,\n\n269\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.650\nis just good information for us.\n\n270\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.220\nOnce again,\ndon't assign to the home server.\n\n271\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.540\nI've selected this one as a restart\nas possible so that looks good.\n\n272\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.230\nSo I'm not changing anything\nbecause this is just showing you.\n\n273\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.670\nBut it's always good to verify on all your\nmachines that are inside of that cluster.\n\n274\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.260\nThis one I've set as restart.\n\n275\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.040\nAnd then the home server notice,\nooh, this one is set as zero, one.\n\n276\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.010\nSo I wanna move that one to,\ndon't assign a home server to that one.\n\n277\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.600\nSo even though they're both\ncurrently running, and\n\n278\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.200\nthey're kind of running on their\nindividual servers here for\n\n279\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.980\nresources inside of now that\nhigh available cluster.\n\n280\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.520\nWhat it should do depending on which\none we end up turning off here,\n\n281\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.170\nit should be able to pick that up and\nstart it off for us.\n\n282\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.140\nSo here is our big test then, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.270\nNow this is gonna take us a few minutes\nwe may actually end up using the magic of\n\n284\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.490\ntv to help us out for\njust a little bit of time.\n\n285\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.520\nAnd that is because I'm not on the highest\nperforming servers that we have available\n\n286\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.470\nto us, they're a little bit older but\nthey will work in the mean time here.\n\n287\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.550\nSo let's select sensor 02.\n\n288\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.851\nAnd if everything is good, and fun,\n\n289\n00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:42.825\nwe're gonna simulate a failure\nby shutting down the XENSVR02.\n\n290\n00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:44.027\n&gt;&gt; Shut it down.\n\n291\n00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.690\n&gt;&gt; Now, by select it, it says, hey,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n292\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.520\nIf you do, it's also gonna shutdown all\nthe current VMs running on it, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.860\nWell, that's fine, remember I have that\ncheck mark at least for that citrix one.\n\n294\n00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.524\nThat are not, not Citrix,\nthe Linux one, it says restart, right?\n\n295\n00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:05.380\nSo, if high availability is operable,\nthen we should be fine with this.\n\n296\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.550\nSo, there was one other thing\nthat I wanted to make sure.\n\n297\n00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.170\nThat's the last thing, it's like doing\nsomething that I wanted to point out.\n\n298\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.240\n&gt;&gt; What was that?\n&gt;&gt; If you're not sure on the VM,\n\n299\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.470\nwhether or not it's configured for\nhigh availability to work.\n\n300\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.650\n&gt;&gt; Notice here, if you select the one and\nthen click on the general tab,\n\n301\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.040\nright here at the bottom you see\nwhere it says high availability.\n\n302\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.700\nIf I scroll over to the right,\nthere's a drop down.\n\n303\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.920\n&gt;&gt; Is this what we had seen earlier?\n\n304\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, yep, so let's see here.\n\n305\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.760\nNotice it tells me that, hey,\n\n306\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.910\naccording to high availability here,\nit says that it's set up, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.170\nIf you don't see that setup, then you\nkinda know, maybe I have to go back and\n\n308\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.300\ncheck the high availability settings.\n\n309\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.850\nFrom there,\nyou would just select the cluster itself.\n\n310\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.870\nGo to HA, verify that\nthe configuration is enabled and\n\n311\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.680\nthat you do have a failure capacity.\n\n312\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.065\nIf you see the failure capacity here\nas zero, then don't do it, okay.\n\n313\n00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:01.780\n[LAUGH] Especially in production,\ndon't do that.\n\n314\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.230\nThat means something else is wrong.\n\n315\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.410\n&gt;&gt; So this is something that we\nmight wanna check even though we had\n\n316\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.090\nsignal notification before-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n317\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Stating that our HA was available for\na failure of one machine.\n\n318\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.150\nBut just as a double of extra precaution.\n\n319\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, think about it, right.\n\n320\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.790\nSo in the,\n\n321\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.570\nand this is where it gets a little bit\nconfusing in Citrix Zen Server here.\n\n322\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.675\nI've selected the cluster again,\nI click on HA.\n\n323\n00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:26.140\nEventhough I can see\neverything that's green and\n\n324\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.010\nhealthy, normally when you see this\nin software and this may just be,\n\n325\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.450\nif Citrix is watching here, it still\ngives me the ability to configure it.\n\n326\n00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.160\nSo I normally think that,\n\n327\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.300\nif I've already configured it why would\nit give me the ability to do that again?\n\n328\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.790\nWhy wouldn't it just say enabled?\n\n329\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.490\nAnd you just have to look and\nverify that it's here.\n\n330\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.510\nBut notice I can go back in and\nconfigure it.\n\n331\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.660\nSo sometimes I think I work very fast,\nbut sometimes I work too fast.\n\n332\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In the sense that I'm not paying\n\n333\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.980\nattention, and\ngo I thought I had configured it.\n\n334\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.150\nNot.\nAnd I go back through and\n\n335\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.490\nI change all my configurations\nthat I've just done.\n\n336\n00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.620\nI'm essentially doing this over again.\n\n337\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.840\nSo that's why you want to verify\neverything before it happens, right?\n\n338\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.490\nSo let's select zen server 02 and now we\nwill shut down that particular zen server\n\n339\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.450\nand it says it's gonna shut down all\nthe VM's currently running on it.\n\n340\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.290\nSo IT pull has, HA has\n\n341\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.100\nITPROTV demo pool has HA enabled,\nhigh availability enabled.\n\n342\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.180\nYou shut it down,\nHA will no longer be guaranteed.\n\n343\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.870\nWhy not?\n\n344\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.950\nWell, because it's only got one.\n\n345\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.500\nOkay.\nYou can't guarantee high availability\n\n346\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.660\nwith one server.\n\n347\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.400\nSo what does it saying?\n\n348\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.270\nIt's saying, if you shut this down and\nyou only got one server.\n\n349\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.280\nThat server gets shut down, you're toast.\n\n350\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.950\nSo are you sure you wanna continue?\n\n351\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.990\nLet's just say yes right now because\nwhat we're trying to do is test it.\n\n352\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.060\nNow you're actually beginning to see part\nof the process here where it went ahead\n\n353\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.210\nand shut down and you're seeing it where\nit's seeing that graceful shut down here.\n\n354\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.110\nEach one of those machines.\n\n355\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.690\nSo during that shutdown and at this point,\n\n356\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.920\nXENSRV02 is now currently\nshutting down itself.\n\n357\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.570\nEach one of these virtual machines\nnow has shut down as well.\n\n358\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.540\nNow this is where it's gonna\ntake a few minutes of time for\n\n359\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.870\nus before something may come back on.\n\n360\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.140\nSo this is all about a waiting game and\n\n361\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.620\nwe'll see how long that\nwe have to wait here.\n\n362\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.130\nBut let's make sure that we\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n363\n00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.840\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; When we start to do this in high\n\n364\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.890\navailability.\n\n365\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.030\nSo, Cherokee there needs to be three\ndifferent components in this, right?\n\n366\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.600\nOkay?\n\n367\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.750\nThere's both of the servers that I have,\nand\n\n368\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.010\nthen we have, this one says you\nneed a shared storage repository.\n\n369\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Share storage or ISCSI.\n\n370\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n371\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.790\nAnd the reason that we need that and\nyou mentioned that I think between show\n\n372\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.940\nyesterday is that that's the reason\nwe need three votes, right?\n\n373\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.031\nOkay, for high availability,\nwhat the idea behind that?\n\n374\n00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:50.840\n&gt;&gt; With quorum voting, it's kind of like\nwhen you were talking about the master.\n\n375\n00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.810\nI don't know the best way to explain\nit but it's saying who needs resources,\n\n376\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.510\nwhat's available.\n\n377\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.870\nIt's kind of just polling\nthe environment to see what's available.\n\n378\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIf you think about it,\n\n379\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.470\nit's the tie-breaker, right?\n\n380\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.740\nSo if you have XenServer 01,\nXenServer 02 up and running,\n\n381\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.990\nthey both may go, all right,\nI wanna be the master.\n\n382\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.340\nThe storage or quorum voter\nthat the guy in the middle says\n\n383\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.040\nI'm just going to vote with one of you.\n\n384\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.370\nSo it just chooses to vote with\none of them, which is fine.\n\n385\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.530\nSo now, when that happens, then everybody\nknows it's going to be XenServer 01,\n\n386\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.770\njust as an example.\n\n387\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.490\nPerfectly fine, but what happens now\nif XenServer 01 goes down instead,\n\n388\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.660\nand it was also the master?\n\n389\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.020\nWell, now remember what happens.\n\n390\n00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.390\nIt's that if XENSERVER01 goes\ndown instead of XENSERVER02,\n\n391\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.780\nnow it says I notice it's time to\nvote again, XENSERVER02 says what?\n\n392\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.470\nI am gonna vote for\nmyself as being the master and\n\n393\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.690\nbeing able to be up and running.\n\n394\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.650\nThe quorum or\nmy iSCSI target on the storage\n\n395\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:03.190\nrepository here says I can't really\nvote for one cuz it's not there.\n\n396\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.000\nSo I'll vote for two and say that\nnow it will come back up for us and\n\n397\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.010\ndo what we want it to do as well okay.\n\n398\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.960\nSo that's what ends up happening and\nthat's how we maintain this availability.\n\n399\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.280\nThen if the other one comes back up\nit does the same thing then vote.\n\n400\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.790\nAnd everything should be, yep,\ngoes through the process again.\n\n401\n00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.580\nSo, at this point we are really just\nwaiting and seeing what happens.\n\n402\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.830\nLet's go back to my machine here now and\n\n403\n00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:33.710\nyou can then see that xensrv02\nhas completely shut down now.\n\n404\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.560\nIt was kind of in that\nprocess of shutting down.\n\n405\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.250\nIt had that little blue icon.\n\n406\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.040\nBut now I can see it's\ncompletely turned off.\n\n407\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.300\nAnd now it's just waiting to see\nif this one is gonna come back on.\n\n408\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.240\nNow I did this between times and,\non this machine,\n\n409\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.070\nit took a long time before\nall the voting went on.\n\n410\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.660\nAnd then it finally ended up coming on and\n\n411\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.920\nit was a good amount of\ntime before it did that.\n\n412\n00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.470\nWe don't wanna do that for the entire\nshow, so I'm gonna cheat here and\n\n413\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.110\neven though I said that I wouldn't cheat,\nI'm going to anyways.\n\n414\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.160\nBut what should end up happening is that\nthis machine eventually will turn on,\n\n415\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.390\nand when it does it will notice that\nzen server 01 is on, and not what it\n\n416\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.380\nwas tied to, which was zen server 02 And\nit should start up on Zen Server 01 okay.\n\n417\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.120\nSo here if we wanted to wait, I did during\n\n418\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.730\na big long break that we had, and when\nI came back it I was like there it is.\n\n419\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.240\nIt's actually up and running but\nit did take a quite a bit of time.\n\n420\n00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.010\nBut since we're actually on\na limited amount of time here.\n\n421\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.590\n&gt;&gt; You've got five minutes left Ronnie.\n\n422\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.690\n&gt;&gt; Just got five minutes left and\nthis is a good place for\n\n423\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.900\nus to kind of end this particular episode.\n\n424\n00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.120\nBut we're not going to wait all five\nminutes is what I'm going to say here.\n\n425\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.200\nIs that what we want to\ndo is simply start this.\n\n426\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.910\nNow if I start it up, remember that it\nwas originally started on XenServer 02,\n\n427\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.320\nnow that it doesn't recognize it,\nif high availability is on,\n\n428\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.360\nif I select that start,\nit should begin the start up process and\n\n429\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.310\nif it fails that's perfectly fine.\n\n430\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.330\nWe know that high\navailability didn't work.\n\n431\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.556\nBut notice that it switched itself and\nit did end up turning on but\n\n432\n00:23:15.556 --> 00:23:21.120\nover on Xen Server 01 so\n\n433\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.410\nit did come back on,\nso I selected restart.\n\n434\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.360\nLet's see if anything has changed here and\n\n435\n00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:32.330\nI've seen that happen as well too where\nif I select this high availability.\n\n436\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.890\nIt's still showing as restart so it should\nhave restarted but it does take some time\n\n437\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.750\nbefore everything is set up the way that\nit wants to and gets pleasant with that.\n\n438\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.660\nNow what about ITPROTV\ndemo web server 2 here?\n\n439\n00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.050\nWell this one is restart if possible.\n\n440\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.960\nWell, let's try and\nsee what happens, right.\n\n441\n00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.857\nSo this one's set up\na little bit differently.\n\n442\n00:23:52.857 --> 00:23:54.601\nIf I right click, and I select Start.\n\n443\n00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:59.825\nNotice it's trying to start and\nit stopped right away.\n\n444\n00:23:59.825 --> 00:24:02.294\nIf I click on notification then,\n\n445\n00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:06.820\nI can see where it did end\nup shutting down the server.\n\n446\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.420\nI started it because I got impatient here\nand I tried to start it but it didn't\n\n447\n00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:17.260\nallow anything to happen and that is\nbecause, if I go back to Xen Server 01.\n\n448\n00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.510\nI can now see that all four\nof these are left over.\n\n449\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.090\nAnd I just have two gigs RAM.\n\n450\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.540\nNotice that it's saying, I'm not really\ncomfortable with just trying to start this\n\n451\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.590\nentire server up with just\ntwo gigs of available RAM.\n\n452\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.290\nSo, it's not gonna allow\nme to start it up here,\n\n453\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.520\nis what it's not gonna allow me to do.\n\n454\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.300\nSo it would take up everything.\n\n455\n00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.370\nSo at this point,\nI'm doing 76% of the memory.\n\n456\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.270\nIt says, 1.9 available, but\nI know that this is gonna require 2.\n\n457\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:49.172\nSo it maybe that it's even reading\nthat little 0.1% and saying, or\n\n458\n00:24:49.172 --> 00:24:51.140\n0.1 gig, 100 gigs.\n\n459\n00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.620\n&gt;&gt; Megabits.\n\n460\n00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100 megabits.\n\n461\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.695\nMegabytes.\n\n462\n00:24:55.695 --> 00:24:56.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Bytes.\n\n463\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.650\n&gt;&gt; 100 megabytes.\n\n464\n00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.350\n&gt;&gt; Bytes.\n\n465\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.290\n&gt;&gt; See, now you've confused me.\n\n466\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:24:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Sorry Ronnie.\n\n467\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's fine.\n\n468\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.730\n100 megabytes inside the IU, you're asking\nfor 100 megabytes more than I have.\n\n469\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.260\nSo that's what we're seeing.\n\n470\n00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.379\nNow eventually,\nlet's say that Zen server 02 here,\n\n471\n00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.520\nwe need to actually physically\nstart that thing back up.\n\n472\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.100\nSo Cherokee,\n\n473\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.550\nI'm just gonna get you to press\nthe power button on our server there.\n\n474\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.610\nAnd let that actually happen.\n\n475\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.100\nSo when this thing kicks back up,\nwe should see it come back online and\n\n476\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.570\nthen from that point on,\n\n477\n00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.190\nthe zen server high availability\ncluster will be available for us.\n\n478\n00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.480\nLet's check that out.\n\n479\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.290\nAnd see what happens here as\nthe result for right now.\n\n480\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.130\nSo even as that server is starting up,\nnotice I'm selected on the cluster.\n\n481\n00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.910\nI selected HA for high availability.\n\n482\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.920\nRight now, you can see even\nthough it's actually available,\n\n483\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.050\nit says configured failure\ncapacity is 0 right now.\n\n484\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.960\nHA cannot guarantee the restart of\nyour protected VMs after the server,\n\n485\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.530\ncuz there's only one, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.790\nIs what it's saying.\n\n487\n00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.340\nAnd now you can see even right here where\nit's saying zen server 01 on the network,\n\n488\n00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.740\none out of two servers.\n\n489\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.550\nAnd the storage on this\none is still healthy, but\n\n490\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.915\nXen server 02 is still in an error state,\nand that's because it's booting back up.\n\n491\n00:26:11.915 --> 00:26:15.140\nIt's gonna take a little bit of\ntime before it shows up here\n\n492\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.220\nto do what we think it's going to do.\n\n493\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.870\nSo it is at least a demonstration.\n\n494\n00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.620\nThat high availability\nis configured correctly.\n\n495\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.910\nIt may take a little bit of time.\n\n496\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.360\nIf you're on a real server, okay, and\n\n497\n00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.860\nespecially today's servers, you may see\nit doesn't take very much time at all.\n\n498\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.150\nEnough time for\nthat server to move its memory over,\n\n499\n00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.210\njust like what we had there, and\nthen we should be up and going.\n\n500\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.380\nBut it would be ideal, if you wanted\nto take the least amount of time,\n\n501\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.070\nserver's configured identically,\neverything is up and running, and\n\n502\n00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.870\nit shouldn't take any time at all.\n\n503\n00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.280\nAnd you're trying to do it where there's a\nlittle bit of disparate types of hardware,\n\n504\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.050\nit may take a little bit more time before\neverything kind of gets configured the way\n\n505\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.160\nthat it wants to.\n\n506\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.430\nBut at least here you've seen\nthe configuration and the set up for\n\n507\n00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.690\na bit of the test, and I know that second\npart, probably wait another half an hour,\n\n508\n00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.160\nit would probably fine, because that's\nhow old my machines actually are.\n\n509\n00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.630\nBut, at the same time,\n\n510\n00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.870\nit will at least get you started in\nthe high availability that you need.\n\n511\n00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.020\n&gt;&gt; And one of the big lessons that\nI can see here would be obviously\n\n512\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.970\nthe more machines you have, the more fault\ntolerance you have within your environment\n\n513\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.150\nbecause we saw with just that one test\nright there, we might have some issues\n\n514\n00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.800\nwith the ram trying to reboot\n&gt;&gt; if we only have a small, but\n\n515\n00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.540\nthen again, it all goes back to your\nbudget, so, take it for what you will.\n\n516\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.120\nBut thank you for showing us how to go\nahead and at least get started here.\n\n517\n00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.030\nConfigure those that we can become\nconsidered high availability within our\n\n518\n00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.940\nnetworks.\n\n519\n00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.470\nSo thank you so much, Ronnie.\n\n520\n00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.160\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\nfor tuning in with us today.\n\n521\n00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.010\nBut I think that about wraps it up.\n\n522\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.960\nWe made it through three episodes\nthere for that cluster configuration.\n\n523\n00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.600\nBut stay tuned.\n\n524\n00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.530\nWe do have some more\nCitrix XenServer headed your way.\n\n525\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.350\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n526\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n527\n00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.999\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n528\n00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:05.953\n[MUSIC]\n\n529\n00:28:05.953 --> 00:28:09.102\nThank you for watching

00:00:08.502\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:12.041\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Citrix Zen Server show.\n\n6\n00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.830\nIn this episode,\nwe will be looking at NIC bonding,\n\n8\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.470\nNIC teaming, NIC aggregation,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n9\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.010\nWe're gonna take a look at how to\nactually perform and set that up.\n\n10\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.140\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios again.\n\n11\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.530\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back as we\ncontinue on in our journey here learning\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.400\na little bit more about Citrix Zen Server.\n\n14\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.480\nAnd we've really take a look at quite\na bit of the technology, getting it ready\n\n15\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.110\nfor our production at work, and showing\nyou how to set up quite a bit of things,\n\n16\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.390\nespecially on the set up side, right?\n\n17\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.480\nWhat do you need to get started?\n\n18\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.250\nWe showed you how you could work\nwith it as a single server.\n\n19\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.640\nWe've also talked about it now and showed\nyou how to configure it for a clustering,\n\n20\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.720\nand then high availability as well.\n\n21\n00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.390\nThe other thing that you can also add in,\nof course,\n\n22\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.440\nis to eliminate the idea of single\npoints of failure in high availability,\n\n23\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.560\nadding in two servers helps us.\n\n24\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.090\nOne server goes down, the other one\npicks back up and we are ready to go.\n\n25\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.000\nBut, there may still be single points\nof failure even in that connection and\n\n26\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.450\nthat creation, and\nthat is when you start having to think\n\n27\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.140\neven there what can we\ndo a little bit better?\n\n28\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.730\nOne of those things, of course,\n\n29\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.330\nis the idea of using what we call NIC\nbonding in the Citrix terminology.\n\n30\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.000\nCherokee is right.\n\n31\n00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.410\nYou've probably heard different\nways of describing it.\n\n32\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.290\nBut what we're really talking about here,\nright,\n\n33\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.640\nis taking two NICs that\nare attached to the same machine.\n\n34\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.310\nAnd when you do so, you can essentially\nuse them and make them work as one.\n\n35\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.640\nAnd that is key for us because that means\nit helps us in many different ways.\n\n36\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.900\nOne, of course, is the idea of fail over.\n\n37\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.300\nOne particular port on the switch bails,\nwhatever it might be, well,\n\n38\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.530\nthen the other one can\ncontinue to operate.\n\n39\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.463\nSo it can really help you out depending\non what you actually need and\n\n40\n00:01:58.463 --> 00:01:59.516\nwhat you want to do.\n\n41\n00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:04.150\nBut one of the key things here is that\nit does help in terms of failover and\n\n42\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.247\nthat idea of redundancy, too.\n\n43\n00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:07.986\nThe second thing it does,\n\n44\n00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:13.046\nwhich is probably even more primarily\nsomething that you want to consider,\n\n45\n00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:17.430\nis that it increases\nthe bandwidth to your Zen server.\n\n46\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.070\nWhat I mean by that is, let's say for\n\n47\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.640\nan example that you have two gigabit,\ntwo one gigabit mix.\n\n48\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.960\nWell, if you bond them together,\nit gives you the ability,\n\n49\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.430\nto use two gigabits at one time.\n\n50\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.530\nSo, two gigabits per second instead of\none gigabit per second in combining.\n\n51\n00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.010\nNow, if you talk, of course, to people and\n\n52\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.620\ngo don't forget it's actually,\nyou know, full duplex.\n\n53\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.710\nSo, you're really getting four.\n\n54\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.730\nYes, you're absolutely right.\n\n55\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.590\nThere is some differentiations of the kind\nof varying come down a little bit but\n\n56\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.190\noverall though,\nthat's the goal and idea, too.\n\n57\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.300\n&gt;&gt; And like I had asked you about\npreviously when we talked about\n\n58\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.210\nactive, active or\n\n59\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.760\nactive passive that's also something that\nwe may be able to consider here in Citrix?\n\n60\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.390\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty much\nwhere we would do this.\n\n61\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n62\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.220\nit really depends on what the need is\nof your particular configuration and\n\n63\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.770\nwhat you actually want to do\nbecause you can kind of out-wit\n\n64\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.820\nyourself at times by doing something,\nthis will give us better performance.\n\n65\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.800\nBut remember, once you actually have\nthat expectation of performance, and\n\n66\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.650\nit's now throughout your entire network.\n\n67\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.990\nIf it goes down or\nlet's say it doesn't code down, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.640\nIf it decreases just that much [LAUGH],\nI'm lying to you, half of that much,\n\n69\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.640\npeople will tend to say,\nsomething's wrong, something is slow.\n\n70\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.220\nAnd you can pull up all the monitoring and\nall the charts you can show, and\n\n71\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.600\ngo I don't see it all.\n\n72\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.720\nEverything looks the same.\n\n73\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.020\nAnd they will still tell you 'no,\nI experienced a slow down.\n\n74\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.800\nAnd there's nothing that you can\ndo except to tell them, okay,\n\n75\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190\nyou experienced it but\nmaybe it's intermittent.\n\n76\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.580\nThat's pretty much\nthe only thing you can do.\n\n77\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.690\nSo you've got to remember that even\nthough giving them more bandwidth and\n\n78\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.440\nbetter performance, that's a goal that\nall of us would love to have, but\n\n79\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.440\nalso by doing it it's a double\nedged sword if you can't maintain\n\n80\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.570\nthat-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.450\n&gt;&gt; To the level of their expectation too.\n\n82\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.110\n&gt;&gt; So you want to have that stability, it\nmight be a better idea to keep that active\n\n83\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.160\npassive notion in mind so that it's\nmore of just like a little reserve.\n\n84\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.640\nSo, it's just something\nthat when we get there,\n\n86\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.040\nwe'll kind of talk about what we can do.\n\n87\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.430\nAnd we'll show you in the configuration-\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n88\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Where it gives you\nsome of those options and\n\n89\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.120\nwhat we can do with it as well.\n\n90\n00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.450\nSo let's make sure we understand\nwhat the minimum requirements are.\n\n91\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.400\nAs a standalone server, you need a minimum\nof at least, well, two NICs, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.780\nSo two is the bare minimum.\n\n93\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.790\nYou can't do it with one.\n\n94\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.840\nYou can do it with four, I think, and\nthree, but you can't do it with just one.\n\n95\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.790\nSo make sure you have two.\n\n96\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.200\nNow, what about other\nhardware requirements?\n\n97\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.880\nWell, the first time that I remember doing\nthis, I was trying to think of what,\n\n98\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.110\nit might have been Hyper-V,\nwhere we tried to do this bonding.\n\n99\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.810\nAnd it required them to\nbe I think Intel NICs.\n\n100\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.260\nThey had to both be Intel NICs and\nthey recommended.\n\n101\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.550\nThey said identical would be preferred,\n\n102\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.890\nif I remember correctly but\nthat was years and years ago.\n\n103\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.070\nAnd I'm trying to think if there was\nanybody else that did that requirement.\n\n104\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.120\nAnd it might have been the earliest\neditions of ESXI, for all I know.\n\n105\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120\nIt's been so long, since I don't remember.\n\n106\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.310\nBut just kind of remember that\nthat's what you had to have.\n\n107\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.990\nSo, usually, you would go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.230\nyou'd order the NICs that you\nwanted in those machines.\n\n109\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.180\nWell, the great thing about the way that\nCitric Zen Server does, they don't really\n\n110\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.810\ncare if you want to use some broad\ncoms and some intels combined here.\n\n111\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.860\nYou may not want to go with Bob's Knicks\nokay whoever Bob out of whatever country.\n\n112\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.880\nBut overall though, they really\ndon't mind if you mix and match.\n\n113\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.430\nNow, what do they mind when it comes\ndown to hardware requirements?\n\n114\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.680\nThe thing that won't work is if you have\na 100 megabit NIC and a gigabit NIC,\n\n115\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.820\nokay, you have a ten gig NIC and\nyou have a one gig NIC, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.140\nThen, it doesn't work\nthe way that you want it to.\n\n117\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.050\nThe idea of bonding it together sounds\ncool and that you can do that, but\n\n118\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.030\nit will assume to use the one with\nthe greatest amount of bandwidth.\n\n119\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.430\nSo, you want them to be equal as what\nyou want them to be, in terms of\n\n120\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.400\nthe bandwidth that goes through them or\nthe throughput that you have through them.\n\n121\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.010\nSo I'm gonna be using two 100 megabit NICs\nis what I'm going to end up using, okay.\n\n122\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.690\nSo just remember that what ends\nup happening is exactly that,\n\n123\n00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.480\nit's just going to equalize and\ndo what it needs to.\n\n124\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.030\nBut if you try to put a higher performing\none versus a lower performing one,\n\n125\n00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.030\nit's probably not gonna be good.\n\n126\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.480\nBut you don't have to worry about,\nhas to be this particular NIC or,\n\n127\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.840\nit has to all be Intel,\nhas to all be Broadcom,\n\n128\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.200\nhas to all be Well whatever\nit is you can do that.\n\n129\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.970\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nwhen we were setting up clustering,\n\n130\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.180\nwe obviously had to have at least\ntwo machines in order to set that\n\n131\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.710\nhigh availability up, what about our\nminimum number of network interface cards?\n\n132\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is pretty much\ngood if you wanted to do that.\n\n133\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.110\nYou have to have at least one\nwithout doing NIC bonding.\n\n134\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.580\nBut remember that most network\ninterface cards today, especially for\n\n135\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.030\nservers, you can buy them with\nmultiple NICs on them, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.390\nFor example, Cherokee, I think I have\nit right there on that computer.\n\n137\n00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.040\nIf you'll pick that one up for\nme right over here on this one,\n\n138\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.864\nthis will kind of help us out, and\nCherokee will be able to show it.\n\n139\n00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:20.700\n&gt;&gt; Ta-dah.\n&gt;&gt; So there it is.\n\n140\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.420\nSo, yup, Cherokee's showing that.\n\n141\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.640\nWell, this one has two\ndifferent network ports on it.\n\n142\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.300\nSo, even a single nick, I know it's kind\nof weird, it's actually a door NIC or\n\n143\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.960\na combo card here, and I've seen\nthem with as many as four on there.\n\n144\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.990\nSo, it just depends on what\nyou have the ability to do.\n\n145\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.990\nYou also have to take into\nconsideration your switch\n\n146\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.520\nthat you're plugging this in to, as well.\n\n147\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.380\nThe reason why is that even though some\nnicks will work perfectly fine with\n\n148\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.020\nthe bonding, it also depends on some\nconfiguration over on the switch side.\n\n149\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.835\nAnd we'll get into that when we get into\nthe configuration point, to see whether or\n\n150\n00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:56.827\nnot it can handle it.\n\n151\n00:07:56.827 --> 00:08:01.012\nSo, there's certain things that you\nmay choose to do with your NICs, and\n\n152\n00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:02.510\nwith the bonding as well.\n\n153\n00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.016\nSuch as using VLANs and\nsome different things there.\n\n154\n00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:08.650\nLATP if you want to do that.\n\n155\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.660\nBut it has to be supported, right?\n\n156\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.640\nSo if you have a switch\nthat supports that,\n\n157\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.610\nyou want to make sure you have\na NIC that supports all that to.\n\n158\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.420\nDon't just go out and buy one, it has four\nnetwork adapter cards in it, it's perfect.\n\n159\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.080\nIt may be perfect until you realize that\nit doesn't support some of the things that\n\n160\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.780\nyou go, this is the one that I\nneeded to get that would support\n\n161\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.800\nwhatever feature set that that is.\n\n162\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.860\nSo, that's kind of key as well.\n\n163\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.360\nSo, as much as I say, it's beautiful,\n\n164\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.500\nit'll let you do all this without\nhaving to worry about too much,\n\n165\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.530\nyou still have to worry about some things,\nand that's kind of the key.\n\n166\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.300\nYou don't want to put a brand-new NIC into\nthose machines that has multiple network\n\n167\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.200\nadapters and then realize it can't do\nthe things that you really want it to do.\n\n168\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.470\nSo make sure you do a little bit\nmore research as you start taking\n\n169\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.390\na look at the idea of bonding here.\n\n170\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.730\nIt is one of the considerations,\n\n171\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.330\nespecially in a high-availability\nenvironment, that you want to consider.\n\n172\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.830\nFor what we did, in a testing environment,\nwe didn't really set that up so much.\n\n173\n00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.660\nBecause it would require me to have two\nof these cards, one for each server,\n\n174\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.520\nto make that work, and I just had\none is what I had available to me.\n\n175\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.310\nSo what we're going to do, of course,\n\n176\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.100\nis show you how do you begin\nconfiguring the idea of NIC bonding?\n\n177\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.900\nAnd we're gonna use just\na Zen center to help us out.\n\n178\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.040\nSo let's go to our machine.\n\n179\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.880\nAnd this is where we'll start off.\n\n180\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.690\nSo I'm just gonna select XENSRV01.\n\n181\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.310\nAnd the reason why is this is\nthe one that has two NICs in it.\n\n182\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.680\nIf I click on XENSRV02 I\ncan click on the NIC here.\n\n183\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.640\nAnd notice that it only has one.\n\n184\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.490\nWell, this one,\nif I take a look at the bottom,\n\n185\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.160\neven though it says I can create a bond,\nI can't create a bond with anybody.\n\n186\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.340\nSo, that would be kind of\na wasted time when we do this.\n\n187\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.790\nRemember that there is\na difference between NICs and\n\n188\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.770\nnetworking, as well, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.060\nSo, with the NICs,\nthis is the physical network adapters.\n\n190\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.210\nThat are on the hosted machine.\n\n191\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.100\nNetworks allow us to be able to create\nmultiple different types of networks that\n\n192\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.880\nwon't inside of each\nmachine if we chose to.\n\n193\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.490\nSo that's kind of the key.\n\n194\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you look at that and\n\n195\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.830\nyou can't really have a team\nwith just one player right?\n\n196\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.320\n&gt;&gt; Not very easily and\nwe don't want to do that.\n\n197\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.600\nSo let's change this up just\na little bit here okay so\n\n198\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.458\nright now let's say that I have two NICs\nthat are on XENSRV01 which I do have\n\n199\n00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:32.240\none is currently connected\nto the production network\n\n200\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.030\nat the other one is connected just\nto a test network from this point.\n\n201\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.810\nWell if I know that I want better\nperformance on my production network,\n\n202\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.030\nI'm probably going to end up changing\nat least the name of this thing.\n\n203\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.150\nAnd I'll just put it on production\nto make it identical here.\n\n204\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.330\nOops, or not identical,\nsee if I can get out of that.\n\n205\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.940\nProbably production2, let's just do that.\n\n206\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.860\nNobody actually likes it if I\nname them both the exact same.\n\n207\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.760\nBut notice I have NIC 0 and NIC 1 now,\nand those are the two I want to combine.\n\n208\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.640\nNow when I take a look at the NIC itself.\n\n209\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.505\nThat actually the network.\n\n210\n00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:09.620\nSee, I'm reading it differently.\n\n211\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.800\nI can rename those.\n\n212\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.060\nOn the NIC I can't rename.\n\n213\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.370\nDoes so.\nWhy I'm renaming this things?\n\n214\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.070\nIn my mind it was working but\nthat's not what I really cared to do.\n\n215\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.030\nSo here it is.\n\n216\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.370\nNow these names I don't think I can\nactually change if I'm right here.\n\n217\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.740\nSo I was doing that totally\non the wrong tab here.\n\n218\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.790\nYou can see the vendor type on this one.\n\n219\n00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.940\nAnd even though I said you didn't\nhave to actually use, see if I can,\n\n220\n00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.248\nmy zoom is kind of out here.\n\n221\n00:11:35.248 --> 00:11:40.570\nSo intel NICs and\nyou can see that these are just a tad\n\n222\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.850\nbit different, so\nthey're not super different.\n\n223\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.390\nOne's 82578DM.\n\n224\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.490\nThis one is 82572EL or EI, one of the two.\n\n225\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.220\nThey're both gigabit network adapters.\n\n226\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.100\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit strange.\n\n227\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.320\nI do not understand what's\nhappened here on mine.\n\n228\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.335\nBecause if I take a look at the speeds.\n\n229\n00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:01.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I saw that.\n\n230\n00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.980\n&gt;&gt; And they showed up,\neven though that they're gigabit NICs.\n\n231\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100 megabits.\n\n232\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsomething in my machine is saying-\n\n233\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.900\n&gt;&gt; It's not fully supporting that speed.\n\n234\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.320\n&gt;&gt; I am not fully supporting\na gigabit of speed here, so\n\n235\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.820\nit's maxing out here at 100 megabits\nusing full duplex, is what we see.\n\n236\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.750\nSo it is a little bit unusual but it will\nwork for our purpose of what we need.\n\n237\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.700\n&gt;&gt; And I think you had answered\nthis questioned before but\n\n238\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.770\nif we were, we know that it's preferred\nto keep everything identical.\n\n239\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.680\nBut if we were to mix and match, it would\njust be dropping down to that lower speed?\n\n240\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah if you had that.\n\n241\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.150\nNow if you think about it though,\nif they're so different.\n\n242\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.220\nLike a gigabit versus 100\nmegabit here snd made to say\n\n243\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.700\nI don't know if I'll even\nuse that 100 megabit at all.\n\n244\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.610\nBut this one, because both of them are\nactually the same as far as megabits go,\n\n245\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.850\nit drops it down to whatever lowest\nspeed or the one that's lower.\n\n246\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.808\nBut you might not be able to always\nhave that if you choose a gigabit and\n\n247\n00:12:56.808 --> 00:12:57.710\n100 bit card.\n\n248\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.950\nIt may go I'm not going to try and\ndo that.\n\n249\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.690\nSo you'll probably just\nend up using one instead.\n\n250\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.760\nSo the cool thing is, in terms of\nthe configuration it's fairly easy.\n\n251\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.780\nI don't know if you can see this or\nnot Cherokee,\n\n252\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.290\nbut it gives me a nice big button\nif I want to create a bond.\n\n253\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.500\n&gt;&gt; I see it.\n\n254\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.860\n&gt;&gt; And that is neat.\n\n255\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.400\nIt's not making me jump through hoops and\n\n256\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.850\nsaying here's how you actually\nconfigure it, it doesn't say that.\n\n257\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.550\nIt says if you want to\nbond these two together or\n\n258\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.460\nmore, select Create Bond,\nand this is what we do.\n\n259\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.970\nWe have a nice, little window for\nus where we can create our NIC bond here.\n\n260\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.010\nNow notice that there\nare multiple options available.\n\n261\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.990\nAnd we'll talk about that since\nCherokee's already brought them up.\n\n262\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.190\nI can select both of the ones\nthat I want to bond together.\n\n263\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.560\nAnd now, I am in unusually Bond mode.\n\n264\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.480\nSo we should hear the theme music for\nJames Bond in the background.\n\n265\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.720\nThat would be cool if that happened but\nwe don't have that.\n\n266\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Bond, NIC Bond.\n\n267\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.700\n&gt;&gt; NIC Bond.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.658\n&gt;&gt; Now it sounds cheesy.\n\n269\n00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:59.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, that's my MO.\n\n270\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.310\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n271\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.780\nSo let's talk about these modes here for\n\n272\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.695\na moment Cherokee since you had\nactually already mentioned them.\n\n273\n00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.510\nActive-active, what do\nyou think that means?\n\n274\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.840\n&gt;&gt; That's where we're gonna have,\n\n275\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.750\nif I have let's say three network\ninterface cards, and I'm gonna be\n\n276\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.300\nrunning if they were gigabit let's say I\nuse one gigabit, one gigabit, one gigabit.\n\n277\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.210\nIt would appear as a three\ngigabit connection.\n\n278\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:21.720\nYeah.\n\n279\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's essentially load\nbalancing between all three, right.\n\n280\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.960\nSo it's gonna allow that to go across all\nthree, and they will all be active, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.410\nSo every card is active,\n\n282\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.880\nthat's the easiest way to remember\nthe idea of active in terms of bonding.\n\n283\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.640\nActive passive?\n\n284\n00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this one's my favorite,\nbecause I'm kind of like a control freak,\n\n285\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.950\ndon't tell anyone Ronnie.\n\n286\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.320\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But I really like the stability and\n\n287\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.210\nknowing what's going to happen.\n\n288\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo if we still have those\nthree network interface cards.\n\n289\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.320\nI have one that's kind of in reserve,\nand then these two so\n\n290\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.310\nI would have a two\ngigabyte connection there.\n\n291\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.380\nIf one would were to fail then\nthis other would kind of, well,\n\n292\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.288\nI'm not doing any kind of symbols or\nanything there.\n\n293\n00:15:01.288 --> 00:15:03.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the other one would kick into gear.\n\n294\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.240\nAnd you wouldn't notice any major\nchanges within your network, and\n\n295\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.989\nyou'd still have time to be able to go\nahead and replace that failed card.\n\n296\n00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:13.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, only Cherokee would see two NICs\n\n297\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.025\nand then use the example with\nthree NICs in our demonstration.\n\n298\n00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:19.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry, Ronnie.\n\n299\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.540\n&gt;&gt; That's funny, so here we go.\n\n300\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.715\nWell, we're gonna do it with\ntwo is what we're gonna do.\n\n301\n00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's also LACP load balancing based\n\n302\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.530\non IP and port and destination.\n\n303\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:35.000\nSo this one LACP, right,\nis our link aggregation control protocol.\n\n304\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.590\nThis gives us the ability to also make\nsure that we tell the switch something.\n\n305\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.580\nRemember that not every\nswitch understands.\n\n306\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.710\nWhen you, when we,\nlink these things together,\n\n307\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.110\nwhen we bond them together, they are going\nto send only one of these Mac addresses.\n\n308\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.440\nNotice it actually has two\nMac addresses here, but\n\n309\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.389\nit is actually going to\nsend one Mac address.\n\n310\n00:15:55.389 --> 00:16:00.183\nWell now on some switches if it sees the\nsame Mac address on two different ports\n\n311\n00:16:00.183 --> 00:16:03.894\nit thinks that only one of those\nmachines should be active.\n\n312\n00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:08.295\nSo it might be that your switch says\nonly one of these should be active.\n\n313\n00:16:08.295 --> 00:16:13.100\nI'm going to turn one of them off and\nnot actually accept a connection.\n\n314\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.575\nSo if you do that with the active-active\nand active-passive and\n\n315\n00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:19.228\nnot set up something like\nLACP on those switches,\n\n316\n00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:22.788\nyou may find out you're really only\ngoing to use one of those NICs.\n\n317\n00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:24.530\nOkay, that's what it comes down to.\n\n318\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.681\nNow with LACP though, it says to\nthe switch, no, we understand something or\n\n319\n00:16:29.681 --> 00:16:35.232\nthe switch says, I understand that same\nMAC address can appear on multiple ports,\n\n320\n00:16:35.232 --> 00:16:37.396\nand we can definitely use that.\n\n321\n00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:41.648\nIt will allow us to do that, and\nalso aggregate the idea of the combined\n\n322\n00:16:41.648 --> 00:16:44.870\nbendwidth together to\ndo what we want to do.\n\n323\n00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.171\nAnd we can do this based\non the IP address and\n\n324\n00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:52.640\nsource, or\nbased on the source MAC address as well.\n\n325\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.990\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy in the world would I ever choose to do\n\n326\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.960\nsomething like this if\nyou actually need it to?\n\n327\n00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.130\nWell if you are using now the NIC bonding,\n\n328\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.200\nlet's say, to dedicate\na connection to your ISCSI target.\n\n329\n00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.360\nOkay, this is the perfect\nopportunity to do so.\n\n330\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.180\nIt gives you that ability to say, I want\nto combine these NICs together, just so\n\n331\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.230\nI can get to that ISCSI target.\n\n332\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.160\nAnd then you can set\nthe MTU size sometimes,\n\n333\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.010\nif you're actually gonna do this,\ndepending on your switch.\n\n334\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.540\nWhether or not it supports what\nwe call Jumbo frames, okay.\n\n335\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:35.250\nJumbo frames gives you that ability got\nabout 9000 or 9128 or whatever it is here.\n\n336\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:40.889\nIt gives you that ability to do so,\nand that way you can actually transfer\n\n337\n00:17:40.889 --> 00:17:45.890\ndata much quicker than that 1500 unit,\nthe MTU value here.\n\n338\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.555\nSo that's what you may actually choose\nto do if you wanted to do something\n\n339\n00:17:49.555 --> 00:17:50.164\nlike that.\n\n340\n00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:54.194\nBut it's telling you that if you do this,\nmake sure that you go to the switch,\n\n341\n00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:58.520\nfigure out what ports that are plugged\nin on, configure LACP on those ports.\n\n342\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.210\nThe great thing is,\n\n343\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.870\nif you're on a Cisco switch it's\na fairly easy configuration dupe.\n\n344\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.877\nI don't know about HP switches or\nJuniper switches.\n\n345\n00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:09.165\nBut I know on Cisco switches, LACP's\nkind of insanely easy to configure and\n\n346\n00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:10.740\nmake that work.\n\n347\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.230\nSo at this point, I'm just gonna\nchoose the active-active here.\n\n348\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.060\nSo this is gonna give me the,\nfor performance,\n\n349\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.070\nit's gonna give me a pretty\nbig boost in performance.\n\n350\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.330\nNow what happens if one of\nthose NICs fails, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.630\nThis is where it now depends on one,\n\n352\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.400\nwhich means all the combines bandwidth\nwill go back over one single link.\n\n353\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.990\nAnd depending on the busyness of your\nnetwork and the connection to your virtual\n\n354\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:39.160\nmachines, this is where you'll experience\nsome slowdown if you end up doing that.\n\n355\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.290\nThat's why when Cherokee said that she\nlikes this idea of active-passive.\n\n356\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.710\nWe're not really increasing\nthe idea of performance too much,\n\n357\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.510\nbut we are actually very good here at\nthe ability of saying, if that NIC\n\n358\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.220\nfails the other one would just take over\nand we'll be off and ready to go, okay?\n\n359\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.640\nSo it just depends on what you want to do.\n\n360\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.750\nWe'll just set up active-active here.\n\n361\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.240\nAnd we'll click create.\n\n362\n00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.702\nAnd so this is actually a good warning,\ncuz I was trying to say this, and\n\n363\n00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.633\nI think I said it right before the show.\n\n364\n00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:14.610\nI didn't know if I needed to go ahead and\ntake down my high availability option or\n\n365\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.310\nnot if I did this.\n\n366\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.950\nAnd this shows you something, right?\n\n367\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.711\nIf you're gonna do this when it actually\nexists in high availability, it says,\n\n368\n00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:26.180\nmanagement interface on\none of the selected NICs.\n\n369\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.500\nMoving that off, moving\n\n370\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.240\nthe management interface to the bond can\nresult in some network heartbeat failure.\n\n371\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.610\nSo this action is not allowed.\n\n372\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:41.700\nSo it's saying, do not do this right now,\nif you already have it configured.\n\n373\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.250\nSo what it's telling you is that you may\nwant to remove the high availability\n\n374\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.650\nfirst, and then do the configuration.\n\n375\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:52.460\nSo we'll click cancel there, and the great\nthing about the high availability cluster\n\n376\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.890\nis it can be set up very quickly.\n\n377\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.423\nIt doesn't take a lot.\n\n378\n00:19:55.423 --> 00:20:00.928\nIf I click back on HA, all I have to\ndo is disable the high availability.\n\n379\n00:20:00.928 --> 00:20:03.180\nAnd it tells you it's\ncurrently being disabled, and\n\n380\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.010\nit will just give a few moments here.\n\n381\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.160\nIn the lower right hand\ncorner of the screen,\n\n382\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.620\nyou'll see that we're waiting\non this bar to appear.\n\n383\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.520\nAnd then we'll be able to\ncombine the NICs together.\n\n384\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.980\nIf you're going to do this and you know I\nam going to be clustering in the future,\n\n385\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.250\nit recommends that for both of those\nmachines in your cluster, then.\n\n386\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.880\nThat you make sure that you have\nthe NICs that you need to have.\n\n387\n00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.634\nIf you're going to set up three,\nlike Cherokee's favorite number here for\n\n388\n00:20:29.634 --> 00:20:33.260\nthe NICs on Zen server one,\nmake sure over on Zen server two,\n\n389\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.270\nyou have three NICs,\nokay, when you do that.\n\n390\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.699\nDon't put in five,\ndon't put in six, put in three.\n\n391\n00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.876\nSo that's another kind of limitation.\n\n392\n00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:46.010\nIdeally that is what we\nwould end up doing, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.898\nSo here you go, you actually end up seeing\nnow where it says it's not configured\n\n394\n00:20:49.898 --> 00:20:51.416\nanyone, and it is ready to go.\n\n395\n00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:56.044\nAnd we go back to XenServer zero one,\nand we create the bond again.\n\n396\n00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:58.272\nAt this point we'll do that.\n\n397\n00:20:58.272 --> 00:21:00.240\nLet's go ahead and set it up for\njumbo frames here.\n\n398\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.239\nLet's just do that.\n\n399\n00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:02.752\nNow you won't do this for everything, but\n\n400\n00:21:02.752 --> 00:21:04.610\nI just wanted to show you\nthat you could do this here.\n\n401\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.210\nAnd I gotta select the NICs, don't I?\n\n402\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.800\nIt's changed to back, so\nthis one doesn't allow me to do that.\n\n403\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.530\nSo, let me click Create.\n\n404\n00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.250\nAnd now it says hey, this will\nautomatically move the management\n\n405\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.116\ninterface to one of the bonds, are you\nsure this may disrupt our connection.\n\n406\n00:21:20.116 --> 00:21:21.350\nSo, it's telling me like look,\n\n407\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:25.140\nyou may lose connection to your XenServer,\nbecause I'm not on a dedicated NIC.\n\n408\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.630\nSo it could be right here where\nI lose connection for a moment.\n\n409\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.188\nOver on the lower left-hand\ncorner you actually end up\n\n410\n00:21:32.188 --> 00:21:34.419\nseeing where it tells\nyou what it's creating.\n\n411\n00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.147\nLet's see if I can zoom in there.\n\n412\n00:21:36.147 --> 00:21:39.790\nNotice it is creating a bond between 0 and\n\n413\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.560\n1 and in the right-hand corner, let's see.\n\n414\n00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.320\nThere it goes.\n\n415\n00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.006\nIt's already done.\n\n416\n00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:48.140\nNow see, it actually didn't take too long.\n\n417\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:54.240\nAnd now you have Bond0 plus 1 is\nwhat you have available, okay?\n\n418\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.590\nSo this now gives you the ability\nto now be using that 0 plus 1,\n\n419\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.040\nand you can, let me see.\n\n420\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.320\nI was trying to see if I could,\nI can't expand that out anymore.\n\n421\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.405\nI was trying to show you where it\nactually would only report one of those\n\n422\n00:22:08.405 --> 00:22:09.710\nMAC addresses.\n\n423\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You can see where it actually\n\n424\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.045\npicked NIC 0s.\n\n425\n00:22:12.045 --> 00:22:14.582\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and it went ahead and said,\n\n426\n00:22:14.582 --> 00:22:18.803\nthis is what will be reported to\nthe switch when we connect to that\n\n427\n00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:20.700\nswitch over to those cards.\n\n428\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.231\nNotice the aggregated\nspeed at this point too.\n\n429\n00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:23.883\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n430\n00:22:23.883 --> 00:22:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yep, so it gives you\nthat ability to do that as well.\n\n431\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.980\nAnd now, everything else.\n\n432\n00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.350\nAnd notice it doesn't even report anything\nelse to it, and we're ready to go.\n\n433\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.070\nSo over on Zen Server 02,\nif I had the same configuration,\n\n434\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.430\nwe would do the same thing.\n\n435\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.050\nAnd from that point, let's see.\n\n436\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.950\nThat now allows for networking.\n\n437\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.460\nTo go over the, if you take\na look at the configuration here.\n\n438\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.102\nSo there it is,\nit's actually using the bonded NICs, so\n\n439\n00:22:49.102 --> 00:22:52.480\nthat you can see that it's saying,\nhey I'm doing this.\n\n440\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.780\nAnd the IP address is over both\nof those connections on the box.\n\n441\n00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.760\nSo it's not choosing one or the other,\nit is actually going over both of them.\n\n442\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.020\nSo this is what gives you that ability\nto have better bandwidth in between and\n\n443\n00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:10.330\nto get better access into of course\nyour XenServers across the network.\n\n444\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:15.190\nGreat when you need to connect in to a\nremote storage like what we did on iSCSI.\n\n445\n00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.130\nGreat if you really just need\nmore bandwidth access to all\n\n446\n00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.620\nof your virtual machines as\nwell as the Zen Server host.\n\n447\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.970\nThis is the way to go is to do bonding.\n\n448\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.850\nThe more NICs that you have in theory,\nof course,\n\n449\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.340\nthat means the more bandwidth\nthat you have access to.\n\n450\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.910\nBut there's a limitation\nin terms of cost though.\n\n451\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.540\nThese can get very expensive.\n\n452\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.310\nSo you have to balance that out too.\n\n453\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.940\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about balancing because\nthe Citrix XenServer at least this edition\n\n454\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.960\nis free.\n\n455\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.900\nThen that maybe something we wanna\nconsider whenever we're looking at\n\n456\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.930\nsetting up NIC bonding and\nthe team to kinda balance it out there.\n\n457\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.990\nSo it's pretty cool.\n\n458\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.890\nThank you for\nshowing us how to set that up.\n\n459\n00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.650\nNot too difficult, and it can be super\nefficient in a business environment,\n\n460\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.940\nso thank you so much.\n\n461\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.240\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n462\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.030\nBut stay tuned, we do have some more\nCitrix Zen Server

Welcome to your Citrix XenServer shows.\n\n4\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.040\nIn this episode we will be looking at how\nto manage and maintain our XenServers.\n\n6\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.730\nWith us today,\nwe have Mr Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n7\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.250\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.380\nhaving me back as we continue on to\ntake a look at more of Citrix XenServer.\n\n10\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.640\nAs we get started here we need to\nknow something up until this point,\n\n11\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.040\nwhich is kind of strange.\n\n12\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.610\nThere's really not a lot left for\nus to go through for basic skills and\n\n13\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.770\nmanaging XenServer.\n\n14\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.620\nOr getting started with XenServer rights\nand that's been the majority of our show.\n\n15\n00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.540\nWe've showed you how to set up everything.\n\n16\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.327\nFrom the very beginning\nof installing XenServer,\n\n17\n00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:55.280\nall the way up to the point where you're\nnow creating high availability clusters.\n\n18\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.110\nBeing able to do bonding, creating\nconnections to storage arrays that are not\n\n19\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.710\ndirectly connected,\nI mean we've done a lot.\n\n20\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.710\n&gt;&gt; We really have.\n\n21\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we really have done quite a bit.\n\n22\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.150\nBut, even all of that, when it's done and\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.890\nover and everything is set up and\nyou're going great.\n\n24\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.310\nThat's not the time to\njust leave it alone.\n\n25\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.160\nI know that's frustrating.\n\n26\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.620\nAnd I'm not taking about tweaking it,\nand making sure.\n\n27\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.400\nBut it's now into that point which that's\nwhy they hire people like you and me.\n\n28\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.100\nIs to manage and maintain or administer\nXenServer and it means that you have to,\n\n29\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.540\nagain, do a little bit more research and\na little bit more details\n\n30\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.270\non some of the things that you're really\ngoing to need to pay attention to.\n\n31\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.820\nSo, there's a couple of options\nthat we have ahead of us.\n\n32\n00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.220\nAnd that is, of course,\n\n33\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.930\ngetting more familiar with\neverything that XenCenter can do.\n\n34\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.800\nAnd there is a lot.\n\n35\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.060\nLet's take a look here inside of\nXenServer again, and we've showed you\n\n36\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.090\nthe majority of all the tools that\nwe see right here, Cherokee okay?\n\n37\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.140\nThey are really about setting it up, okay,\n\n38\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.270\nthey're not really about\na lot of other things.\n\n39\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.780\nSo adding the new server, basic okay?\n\n40\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.850\nBut it's about setting up\nto work with Xen center.\n\n41\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.890\nCreating a new pool.\n\n42\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.300\nOnce again about setting it up.\n\n43\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.650\nNew storage again, new VM's.\n\n44\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.760\nOnce again about setting it up.\n\n45\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.430\nBut everything else though at this point.\n\n46\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.530\nThis is why you and I get paid okay?\n\n47\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.490\nIs to maintain, in other words make\nsure that everything continues to work\n\n48\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.890\nthe way it needs to as well as to\nmanage when things do go wrong.\n\n49\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.800\nAnd to actually take a look and\nmonitor the situation as it comes through.\n\n50\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.290\nSo the great thing is all these utilities,\nthe majority of them,\n\n51\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.380\nare built right in in a nice little GUI,\nor graphical user interface, GUI.\n\n52\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.910\nGives you that ability to just point and\nclick to what you want.\n\n53\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.470\nIf you want to focus in on a single VM.\n\n54\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.260\nYou select it and\nnow you have of course all the details and\n\n55\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.770\nall the tabs available for\nwhat you want to do.\n\n56\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.880\nYou want to monitor for four minutes.\n\n57\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.200\nYou can do that.\n\n58\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.580\nYou want to directly see\ninto the console of that.\n\n59\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.970\nYou can of course, as well as attach\nit to different networks very quickly,\n\n60\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.110\nvery easily.\n\n61\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.750\nYou name it.\n\n62\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.740\nThose are some of the things\nthat we can do here, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.760\nThe limitation though,\nCherokee, is fairly simple, but\n\n64\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.800\nit's a glaring limitation\nat the same time.\n\n65\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.170\nDo you happen to know what\nI might be talking about?\n\n66\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.860\n&gt;&gt; Well I know you mentioned it before,\nbut I'm not a hundred percent sure.\n\n67\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.620\nAre you referencing this\nsoftware is really designed to be\n\n68\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.840\nin a Windows environment?\n\n69\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.180\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty much it.\n\n70\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.650\nSo if you are.\n\n71\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.170\nIf you love Linux and you're going,\nall right, Xen Server, I'm ready to go.\n\n72\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.200\nTough luck, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.970\nIf you are a Mac user and\nyou go all right, I'm ready for\n\n74\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.390\nXen Center, tough luck, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.430\nSo that means for you just like for\nme here, I don't really want\n\n76\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.840\nto necessarily run a Windows machine but\nIf I'm going to be managing a zen server,\n\n77\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.390\nthe easiest way for me to do so\nis kind of fairly involved, right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.460\nI need to bring up at\nleast a Windows machine.\n\n79\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.430\nIt doesn't matter which version\nof Windows pretty much.\n\n80\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.000\nI would select the latest and\nthe most secure version.\n\n81\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.690\nBut you have to bring that up.\n\n82\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.450\nAnd that can be in a virtual environment\nBut it still has to be another,\n\n83\n00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.500\nphysical machine that I really\ndon't want to maintain or\n\n84\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.520\nmanage or keep up to date with Antivirus\nor up to date every time I need to.\n\n85\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.550\nIt's just extra work.\n\n86\n00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.690\nIt's me having to manage two\ndifferent machines to do so.\n\n87\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.650\nSo, you still have to.\n\n88\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.910\nThere's still some things that,\nhaving the GUI available to us, so\n\n89\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.860\nthe Graphic User Interface,\nIs really something that we appreciate.\n\n90\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.220\nPoint and click is always\neasier to be able to see it\n\n91\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.700\nat least from my perspective.\n\n92\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.790\nAnd somebody else that loves command line\nlike, no, no, you can see it this way.\n\n93\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.190\nBut, at the same time, it is.\n\n94\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.520\nIt's easier for us to manage and there's\na lot more for us to be able to do.\n\n95\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.420\nBut let's say that you happen to work in\nan environment in which there might be\n\n96\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.210\none Windows machine that you all\nshare as far as running the sever and\n\n97\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.090\nthat this software is installed on it.\n\n98\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.220\nBut you don't have access\nto it all the time and\n\n99\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.490\nit might not be available all the time.\n\n100\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.810\nWell then at that point how do you\nstill do some of those same things\n\n101\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.020\nin terms of managing and maintaining\nsomething inside of that environment?\n\n102\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.070\nWell that is when it gets\na little bit more tricky\n\n103\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.890\nis what we have to actually\nthink about here, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.600\nSo what can we do?\n\n105\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.090\nWell one of the things that we can is we\ncan literally drop down to the command\n\n106\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.710\nprompt and get access into the shell\nof the actual XenServer host too.\n\n107\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.610\n&gt;&gt; Ronny, when you're talking about\ndifferent versions of our XenServers,\n\n108\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.270\nthe software,\nat the very beginning of the series,\n\n109\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.750\nI really didn't see anything like\nMicrosoft has their core install.\n\n110\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.070\nSo what would be a benefit\nof using a command line.\n\n111\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.360\nWhy would we choose that option?\n\n112\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Well the option is because\nI can actually use that.\n\n113\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.510\nIf I'm on a Linux machine.\n\n114\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.350\nIf I'm on a Mac.\n\n115\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.820\nIf I'm on any other type of machine,\nlearning a few of the basic commands and\n\n116\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.320\ngetting a little bit ahead of the game\nmeans you don't always have to wait for\n\n117\n00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.110\nthat machine to.\n\n118\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.680\nIf your environment is totally Mac or\ntotally Linux, you might still have\n\n119\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.080\na Windows machine but you might not\nhave access to it all the time.\n\n120\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.250\nThere are some things that you\ncan do inside of the command line\n\n121\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.120\nthat will help you to manage\nit a little be easier.\n\n122\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Now we're going to stay focused\n\n123\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.290\nin on the few basic commands here.\n\n124\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.190\nJust some of the things that you\nhave to get started with, but\n\n125\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.790\nthere's a lot more to go.\n\n126\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.580\nIf you dive into the CITRIX documentation.\n\n127\n00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.550\nOn XenServer and everything else, you'll\nsee that there's a lot of things that\n\n128\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.430\nthey automatically say,\nlook here is the command line to do it.\n\n129\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.680\nAnd they don't really tell you in the GUI\nhow to do it because they expect that\n\n130\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.060\nyou can figure it out.\n\n131\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.010\nBut overall though,\nthey do it inside the command line.\n\n132\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.720\nThe secondary advantage of this is not\nonly that I can run it from a Linux or\n\n133\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.140\na Mac environment if I want to But if the\nability to automate certain things, right.\n\n134\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.010\nRunning scripts is kind of a key thing for\nus.\n\n135\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.420\nFor example of starting up servers if\nthey go down doing certain things, well\n\n136\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.340\nif I don't have access to the zen center\nand I have high available set up and\n\n137\n00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.370\nwhen my servers didn't turn\nback on I need to start it.\n\n138\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.760\nWell, now what do I do?\n\n139\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.170\nWhat if I take my Mac Book home and\n\n140\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.890\nmy Windows machine is at the office and\nI don't have remote desktop set up?\n\n141\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.580\nWhich would be silly but\nlet's do it for a hypothetical here.\n\n142\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.410\nAnd I don't have that.\n\n143\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.710\nI'd have to wait until the next\nmorning to turn on my XenServer?\n\n144\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.440\nThat would be silly but would you have to?\n\n145\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.980\nYes, or I'd have to come back into\nthe office and do whatever I needed to.\n\n146\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.460\nNow, most of you are saying,\nit's a ten minute drive, big deal.\n\n147\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.650\nWell, for you it is.\n\n148\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.560\nFor me, it's an hour drive\ninto work every day, so to me,\n\n149\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.050\nit's a little bit bigger of a deal.\n\n150\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.090\nSo, I don't wanna do stuff like that.\n\n151\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.610\nBut the great thing is, if everything is\nset up correctly which it normally is, By\n\n152\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.621\ndefault, XenServer itself when you install\nit, it automatically opens up SSH for you.\n\n153\n00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:49.597\nSo that means I can be able to\nSSH directly into my XenServers,\n\n154\n00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:54.190\nif I have everything configured for\nme to be able to gain access to them.\n\n155\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.069\nWithout needing to go into\nXenCenter to do the configuration,\n\n156\n00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.800\nto start up certain things to do all that.\n\n157\n00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n158\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.630\n&gt;&gt; So it is really cool.\n\n159\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.610\nYou have automation,\n\n160\n00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.250\nyou have the ability to not necessarily\ndepend on the XenCenter itself or\n\n161\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.240\neven depend on a Windows machine running\nto make sure that everything can be done.\n\n162\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.670\nSo that's what we want to do.\n\n163\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.250\nNow, let's take a look inside of\nour XenCenter one more time and\n\n164\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.190\ntry and see something here, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.780\nNow Cherokee,\n\n166\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:28.250\nwe pointed out quite a bit of information\nover the past several episodes here.\n\n167\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.800\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n168\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.390\n&gt;&gt; But the one thing we\nhaven't seen is any notion\n\n169\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.920\nof getting into a command\nline anywhere on here.\n\n170\n00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So I have looked for it, right here.\n\n171\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.920\nAnd you go, well, wait a minute.\n\n172\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.860\nIf you can get into the command line,\n\n173\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.640\nwhy can't you get into it\nfrom XenCenter itself?\n\n174\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.640\nI know that I can go to the Xen server\nhost machine and there's an option,\n\n175\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.230\nthe very last option,\nto directly console into it.\n\n176\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.420\nI know that I can get to that option and\nrun it, there's no doubt about it.\n\n177\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.400\nBut from XenCenter there\nis a way to get to it,\n\n178\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.547\nit's not hidden it's just something\nthat we haven't taken a look at.\n\n179\n00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:03.134\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n180\n00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.270\nthat's what we want to show you today.\n\n181\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.780\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So, you don't have to do it this way.\n\n182\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.380\nThere's also a couple of other\noptions that we have available and\n\n183\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.890\nI'll show you that as well.\n\n184\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.610\nBut if I wanted to get into the console so\nI can start typing in commands into\n\n185\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.840\nXenCenter I can simply\nclick on XENSRV01 here.\n\n186\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.610\nAnd then I can click on console.\n\n187\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.270\nNow when I do that on the console,\nwell we've seen this before.\n\n188\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.810\nWe can enter in a password and\neverything's ready to go.\n\n189\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.360\nBut notice in the upper\nright hand corner here\n\n190\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.170\nthere is that where it\nsays open SSH console.\n\n191\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.770\nSo this gives me that ability to\ndirectly console into this machine\n\n192\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:53.760\nas if it were me just SSH-ing in from\nmy Macbook if I wanted to to do this.\n\n193\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.360\nLet me change this setting here just for\na moment so\n\n194\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.640\nthat we can see the font\na little bit better.\n\n195\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.100\nI'll do it to 16 point here,\nthat'll make it a little bit better.\n\n196\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.733\nAnd let me also change the color.\n\n197\n00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.584\nSometimes I think that the green\nlooks good, but it may not.\n\n198\n00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:10.690\nChange it to white.\n\n199\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.820\n&gt;&gt; Hacker green.\n\n200\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.400\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not?\n&gt;&gt; I'm just worried about the size,\n\n201\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.415\nthat's my biggest qualm.\n\n202\n00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:16.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay is that still too small?\n\n203\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.650\nOkay, we'll change it a little bit\nlarger then for Cherokee's sake so\n\n204\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.770\nthat she can see it.\n\n205\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.310\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n206\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.510\n&gt;&gt; Change it to 20.\n\n207\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n208\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.630\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see that.\n\n209\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.768\nThere we go.\nHopefully you can see that now.\n\n210\n00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:28.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it looks great.\n\n211\n00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:31.090\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.660\n&gt;&gt; So every single word on my machine will\n\n213\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.400\nactually take up that much space now,\nso there we go.\n\n214\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.600\nSo I can log in.\n\n215\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.844\nNow you wanna make sure of course that\nyou have an account that you can log into\n\n216\n00:10:40.844 --> 00:10:41.458\nthe machine.\n\n217\n00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:45.940\nAnd there we are.\n\n218\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.500\nSo we are able to log directly in it.\n\n219\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.990\nNow this is from a Windows machine,\nit's directly from the XenCenter.\n\n220\n00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.580\nWhat if you don't have XenCenter?\n\n221\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.660\nOkay.\nWell, great thing is if I go to my machine\n\n222\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.900\nand I simply launch out my terminal.\n\n223\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.460\nLet me dismiss that tip there.\n\n224\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.649\nNow I can ssh in.\n\n225\n00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:10.300\nAnd I'll go to the other machine here.\n\n226\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.020\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; I think, we'll see, ssh root.\n\n227\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.560\nSee.\n\n228\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.240\nThere we go.\n\n229\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.540\nNotice that it's given me the connection.\n\n230\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.164\nIt's asking me,\nsaying here's the certificate.\n\n231\n00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:23.140\nAnd now it's asking me for the password.\n\n232\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.140\nLet's see here.\n\n233\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.480\nMy super secret password.\n\n234\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.730\nAnd there it is.\n\n235\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.860\nNotice that I am at the root@xensrv02 and\nI'm ready to go.\n\n236\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.978\nSo I don't necessarily have to go to\na Windows machine to do this, but\n\n237\n00:11:38.978 --> 00:11:43.238\nif I can't ssh into it, in other words,\nif I don't know how to do this,\n\n238\n00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:45.378\n[CROSSTALK] you can still pull it up.\n\n239\n00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:46.990\n[LAUGH] It can still be done, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:53.330\nBut most of, and I do need to make that\ncaveat, this is not for the faint hearted.\n\n241\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.960\nI don't want to say that.\n\n242\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.070\n&gt;&gt; I've seen your notes Ronnie,\n\n243\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.260\nand I see we have a lot of\ntyping in our near future.\n\n244\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes we do.\n\n245\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.570\nAnd the reason why I actually type it out,\n\n246\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.940\nis cuz I'm not gonna remember\nevery command myself.\n\n247\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.790\nBut it is something that you need to\nat least understand and if you can get\n\n248\n00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.740\nthe basics down it will really help you\nout especially if you need to go and\n\n249\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.410\nfind documentation in the future\nto do something that you want to\n\n250\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.230\ndo from Citrix Xen Server itself.\n\n251\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.850\nThey've got plenty of\ndocumentation on how to do this.\n\n252\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.770\nBut at the beginning here that's what we\nwant to do is we want to be able to do\n\n253\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.690\nsomething like this and access it okay?\n\n254\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.960\nSo I'm going to switch back over\nto the machine that we're gonna do\n\n255\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.180\nthe demonstration on.\n\n256\n00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.321\nWhich of course is going to be,\nwell, this one,\n\n257\n00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:36.110\nwhich is Xen server 10.0.46.100 here,\nis what we want to be able to do.\n\n258\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.116\nSo at the very beginning, if I wanted\nto start understanding a little bit,\n\n259\n00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:43.610\nXenCenter or Xen server itself,\n\n260\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:49.720\nit has a command console or\na command line that's called xe or z.\n\n261\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.740\nI don't know exactly how to pronounce it.\n\n262\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.760\nI'm sure somebody knows exactly\nhow to pronounce it, but\n\n263\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.650\nit's all about this, okay?\n\n264\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.620\nEvery command begins with xe.\n\n265\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.610\nAnd that you actually have.\n\n266\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.400\nSo if I wanted to actually understand\na little bit better I can type in help and\n\n267\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.170\nthen I can do, well I can spell all maybe.\n\n268\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.170\nIt would help.\n\n269\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.380\nI could see every single command\nthat I have available to me.\n\n270\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.325\nNow, it's not listed in this kind\nof nice block format that we like,\n\n271\n00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.590\nthat we love to have.\n\n272\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.797\n&gt;&gt; Is it in alphabetical order, at least?\n\n273\n00:13:19.797 --> 00:13:20.929\n&gt;&gt; It is in alphabetical order to a point.\n\n274\n00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was trying to tell.\n\n275\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going to say it's\nall in alphabetical order.\n\n276\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.190\nBut you can see, if you need to configure\nsomething on the host it's fairly simple.\n\n277\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.410\nIt follows a very hierarchical\ntype of structure, right?\n\n278\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.880\nEverything that is done on the host\nbegins with the word host.\n\n279\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n280\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.730\nthen at that point you kind\nof separate that down.\n\n281\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:43.080\nIf I scroll down you can see where VMs are\ncalled out if I wanted to configure VMs.\n\n282\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.589\nAnd then if I scroll a little bit further\ndown, if there were certain appliances,\n\n283\n00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:55.440\nbonding the console, oops,\nI skipped past console there.\n\n284\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.750\nDiagnostics, disaster recovery\ntask that you have available,\n\n285\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:06.490\ngraphics processing unit, logs,\nmessages that come by, oops,\n\n286\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.270\nnetwork, patchings,\n\n287\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.600\npbd, which I don't really exactly\nknow what that means here.\n\n288\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.120\nAnd of course there's also pgpu, this of\ncourse is some interface that we have.\n\n289\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.380\nPhysical interface is the pif here.\n\n290\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.420\nPools which we've configured\nas far as resource clusters.\n\n291\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.690\n&gt;&gt; So if we're not fluent with\nthis Xen Server language,\n\n292\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:34.060\nis there any kind of tool or assistant\nthat like hitting the tab button for\n\n293\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.710\ninstance that kind of help us propagate\nthe rest of the commands here?\n\n294\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.680\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlet's see if that actually happens here.\n\n295\n00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.984\nSo we can try this out and see.\n\n296\n00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Like that [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.\n\n297\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.750\n&gt;&gt; Let's do, Xen.\n\n298\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.760\nNo.\n\n299\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.933\nSo I was just trying to do xen help and\nit wouldn't even do that for me, so no.\n\n300\n00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:52.801\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAll right!\n\n301\n00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:55.480\n&gt;&gt; So yes, it means that you have\nto know some of these commands.\n\n302\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.810\nMost of us are not going to go\nthrough every single one of them, but\n\n303\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:03.790\nI'm assuming if you're watching a show for\nXen server you might\n\n304\n00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.580\nbe the one that goes through and knows\nevery single one of these commands here.\n\n305\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.580\nBut just kind of realize most people\nare gonna do this because there's some\n\n306\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.490\nspecific need that they have.\n\n307\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.550\nAnd either they can't figure out how\nto get it done inside of XenCenter,\n\n308\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.600\nwhich means it can't be\ndone inside of XenCenter,\n\n309\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.280\nwhich means you have to drop down there.\n\n310\n00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.020\nOr you happen to be on a machine like this\nand go I don't have access to that Windows\n\n311\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.810\nmachine but I still need to get it done,\nit can still be done.\n\n312\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.787\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's really what it comes down to\n\n313\n00:15:29.787 --> 00:15:31.010\nwhen you start seeing it.\n\n314\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.020\nSo let's just show a couple of\ndifferent ones that will really\n\n315\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.730\nhelp us at the very beginning, okay?\n\n316\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.587\nAnd we're really focusing in on\none particular item because of\n\n317\n00:15:41.587 --> 00:15:43.885\nwhat our goal is for this too.\n\n318\n00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:49.460\nWhich is to get what we call the uuid,\nthe universal unique identifier.\n\n319\n00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.362\nThe universal unique identifier.\n\n320\n00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:52.615\nIt is what we want, okay?\n\n321\n00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:57.326\nSo, one of the first things that we\nmay choose to do here is to see all of\n\n322\n00:15:57.326 --> 00:15:59.860\nthe VMs that we have available to us.\n\n323\n00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.040\nSo I start with xe and then vm-list, okay?\n\n324\n00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.360\nWhen I do this,\nnotice that all of these begin, and\n\n325\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.000\nyou'll see there's that UUID,\nit tells me it's read only.\n\n326\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.440\nAnd it's that universal unique\nID number that we have going.\n\n327\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.080\nAnd I also have this name\nlabel here too that tells me\n\n328\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.280\nthe name that I assigned to that VM.\n\n329\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.660\nSo, this is key if we want to\nstart creating some things and\n\n330\n00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.280\nthat universal unique ID is the one\nthat we wanna pay attention to.\n\n331\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.660\nI know it's gonna sound strange,\n\n332\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.550\nbut we're gonna end up trying to create\na VM using the command line here.\n\n333\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.055\nBut overall though, at least at\nthe beginning you want to be able to\n\n334\n00:16:42.055 --> 00:16:45.759\npull this up, and be able to find\nthe UUID for anything that you got to.\n\n335\n00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:48.308\n&gt;&gt; So Ronny, you said we're just\ngonna create a virtual machine from\n\n336\n00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:49.456\nthe command line interface.\n\n337\n00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:51.720\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is what we are going to do.\n\n338\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.420\nWe're gonna try and do that.\n\n339\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.400\nThere are also a couple of other things\nthat you may want to do which is gonna be\n\n340\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:05.220\nxe and then we can also do vm\nif we chose to dash start.\n\n341\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.920\nNow, this is not one that\nyou wanna run by itself, but\n\n342\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.820\nif I had a VM that wasn't running\nout here for right now, and\n\n343\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.390\nI think all of mine are running,\nof course, I could actually start up a VM.\n\n344\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.449\nLet me see if I can shut one\ndown here to do this, and\n\n345\n00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:26.630\nI will do it on the,\nLet's do web server 02 there.\n\n346\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.832\nSo I'll select this web server 02 and\nwe will shut it down gracefully,\n\n347\n00:17:32.832 --> 00:17:35.317\nlet that thing shut down for a moment.\n\n348\n00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:41.430\nAnd I just wanna verify that it shut down.\n\n349\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.330\nAll right, so it's completely shut down.\n\n350\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.270\nNow, if we go back to that\ncommand line utility instead, and\n\n351\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.380\nwe'll do that vm-list.\n\n352\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.880\nLet me see if I can find\nthe one that I just shut down.\n\n353\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.430\nThere it is.\n\n354\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.375\nHere is the one that is halted, right?\n\n355\n00:17:59.375 --> 00:17:59.950\n&gt;&gt; Halt.\n\n356\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.030\n&gt;&gt; So, if I do this, there's a couple\nof things, and this is where it becomes\n\n357\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.610\na little bit tricky in the command line,\ndepending on how you do this.\n\n358\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:15.320\nI want to run xe vm-start,\nfrom this point I need that UUID.\n\n359\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.470\nThis is where I can highlight\n\n360\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.230\ninside of the command line, and\nthen I can right click on it.\n\n361\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.730\nAnd now, notice it paste the entire UUID.\n\n362\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.410\nIt's even gone past my head here.\n\n363\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:35.280\nThen I can do that, it didn't like\nmy field number, so let me see here.\n\n364\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.210\nDid I not copy the whole thing?\n\n365\n00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.080\nIt says I copied the whole thing.\n\n366\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.656\nUnknown field,\nI may have to actually put UUID.\n\n367\n00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:55.920\nThere we go.\n\n368\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.500\nSo, I knew I forgot a part of the command.\n\n369\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.140\nI was like, what did I do here?\n\n370\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.470\nSo, this will now start\nup the actual host there.\n\n371\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.520\nAnd then I can see, it went ahead and\nstarted up Xenserver 02.\n\n372\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.320\nSo you can even start VMs this way.\n\n373\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.170\nImagine that, not needing access\nto the actual xencenter itself.\n\n374\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.230\nWe can simply do something like this,\nand that will help us out.\n\n375\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.080\nSo, just as an example of some utility and\ntool that we can do too.\n\n376\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.730\nThe other thing that you may\nalso need if you wanted to,\n\n377\n00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.650\nlet's say,\nconnect to the storage repository,\n\n378\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.650\nyou can also do a xe with sr,\nwhich means storage repository list.\n\n379\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.550\nAnd you'll notice it\nbrings you the same thing.\n\n380\n00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.600\nLocal storage, removable storage,\nDVD drive, Xen server tools.\n\n381\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.270\nAnd this is of every single iso it looks\nlike that we might have access to, or\n\n382\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.060\na lot of them.\n\n383\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.000\nThere's the storage, too.\n\n384\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.810\nSo you can see here's that iSCSI\nconnection that I had available and\n\n385\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.650\nthat is, again, that's a private number\nthat you'll want to do if you wanted to\n\n386\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.610\nreconfigure that in just a little\nbit in terms of the connection.\n\n387\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.890\nSo there are a lot.\n\n388\n00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.093\nSo anything that you want,\nthe network adapter,\n\n389\n00:20:09.093 --> 00:20:14.030\nnetwork-list, Is also key.\n\n390\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.075\nAnd all this, and you're probably saying,\nwhy are you showing us all this?\n\n391\n00:20:17.075 --> 00:20:20.340\nIt's so that we can have at least\nthe basic commands that we need\n\n392\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.790\nto build up and to do some of the things\nthat will allow us to create a VM, okay?\n\n393\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n394\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.130\n&gt;&gt; But ultimately, you just kind of\nget the idea that this is possible.\n\n395\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.780\nThat being able to at\nleast run these commands,\n\n396\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.280\ngetting that UUID is gonna be one of\nthe most important things that you ever do\n\n397\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.520\nif you want to manipulate that and\ndo some of those things.\n\n398\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.544\n&gt;&gt; So I have to ask Ronnie,\n\n399\n00:20:38.544 --> 00:20:41.330\nwhat's the actual command to\ncreate a virtual machine?\n\n400\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee,\nwe're gonna get started and\n\n401\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.770\nthe way that we do it is kind of the same\nway that we did it inside of XenServer\n\n402\n00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.080\nwhere we walk through and the first\nthing that we picked out was a template.\n\n403\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.410\nSo, we need to see the templates\nthat we want to create.\n\n404\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.680\nI'm gonna just use\na CentOS type of template.\n\n405\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.875\nSo, I'm going to try and\nget a list of templates here, and\n\n406\n00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:05.790\nthat's template-list,\nthen I'm gonna add in a filter for\n\n407\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.770\nthe name label, name label, not filter.\n\n408\n00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.925\nThat's what I get for\ntrying to talk and type at the time.\n\n409\n00:21:13.925 --> 00:21:20.160\nThen I'm also gonna grep this in\nto include anything with Cent.\n\n410\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.450\nI have to spell it correctly.\n\n411\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.620\nThis is case sensitive, that's why I'm\ntrying to make sure that I do this.\n\n412\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.410\nCentOS 6.\n\n413\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:36.662\nAnd let me see,\nwhere did I type that in incorrectly here?\n\n414\n00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:42.210\nOS include, let me just try CentOS.\n\n415\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.110\nThere we go, let me just remove the 6 and\nthat will help us out.\n\n416\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.160\nAnd so, here, I was trying to be too\nspecific is what I was trying to be.\n\n417\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.880\nAnd, if you try and\n\n418\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.590\ndo the whole thing, it's asking me like\nyou forgot this part, is what's happening.\n\n419\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.350\nSo I forgot about the 64 bit part here.\n\n420\n00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.740\nSo, now I can see the one\nthat I really want is\n\n421\n00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.860\nthis one right here cuz I know I\nhave a minimal install for this one.\n\n422\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:12.180\nSo, that is the one that I want to\nmake sure that I get access to,\n\n423\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.270\nright here is the key.\n\n424\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, what we're looking at\nhere, is this very similar to what we saw\n\n425\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.925\nin the GUI where they had those\nprofiles built up for like hardware\n\n426\n00:22:21.925 --> 00:22:25.890\nrecommendations and so forth depending\non the different operating systems?\n\n427\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda the same thing,\n\n428\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.358\nit's just like what we saw where we\ncould pick from that list of templates.\n\n429\n00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:33.072\nAnd here, we just scroll down\nto the CentOS portion and\n\n430\n00:22:33.072 --> 00:22:34.315\nwe were able to see that.\n\n431\n00:22:34.315 --> 00:22:36.000\nI need to select the one that I want.\n\n432\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.920\nI know I have that 6.7,\nI think a minimal install.\n\n433\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.050\nSo this is the one that we want\nto help us out as well, okay?\n\n434\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.200\nNow, once we have something like this,\n\n435\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.810\nthe next thing that we also need to do\nis now that we're gonna create our own\n\n436\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:56.650\ntemplate based off of this is that we need\nto generate a nice UUID for us as well.\n\n437\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:04.387\nSo, the way that we do this is\nwe do xe vm-install template.\n\n438\n00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:09.325\nThen we have to give\nthat template a name and\n\n439\n00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:12.690\nthat name is gonna be the same\nas what we have right here.\n\n440\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.100\nSo I'm just gonna highlight it and\nI need to put parenthesis around it, and\n\n441\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.790\nthen I can close off the parentheses.\n\n442\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.690\nThen I'm gonna tell it, I want to\nactually apply a new name to this label.\n\n443\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.913\nNow you don't have to do the new name but\n\n444\n00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:32.831\nI'm gonna do it just so\nthat we can keep up here.\n\n445\n00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:40.057\nAnd we'll call this one Cent0S 6.7,\n\n446\n00:23:40.057 --> 00:23:47.081\nI think is the one that I want, amd64.\n\n447\n00:23:47.081 --> 00:23:49.244\nAt least that's what I have typed out.\n\n448\n00:23:49.244 --> 00:23:54.020\nNow if you do something like this, it will\ngive you that ability then to run this.\n\n449\n00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.400\nAnd notice,\nit will now generate a new UUID-\n\n450\n00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n451\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.090\n&gt;&gt; That will help you out for\nwhat you want to be able to do.\n\n452\n00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.650\nNow, the problem that we have is,\n\n453\n00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:08.670\nI'm gonna need to reuse this a lot,\nwhen it comes down to the creation point.\n\n454\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.843\nSo what we can do instead is go ahead and\ncreate a variable.\n\n455\n00:24:12.843 --> 00:24:16.390\nAnd I'm gonna make sure\nit's case sensitive here.\n\n456\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.530\nThen highlight cuz that’s\nwhat we needed here.\n\n457\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.720\nRight click and that will paste it in.\n\n458\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.409\nSo UUID equals this.\n\n459\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.260\n&gt;&gt; So when you say variable, are we\ntalking about kind of like an alias or\n\n460\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.320\njust an easy to remember\nway to go ahead and\n\n461\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.030\ntype this out instead of\nmemorizing that UUID?\n\n462\n00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it actually makes it easier,\nthat's all it does.\n\n463\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.530\nSo that way later one when\nwe start creating it,\n\n464\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.580\nthat is what we will end up doing.\n\n465\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.080\nAnd we will end up having to do here,\nokay.\n\n466\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.000\nThe other thing that I'm gonna do\nis also create a name variable so\n\n467\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.270\nthat we don't have to keep typing\nout this long gigantic name.\n\n468\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.880\nInstead, what we're going to do,\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n469\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.636\n&gt;&gt; So, this is gonna be that\n\n470\n00:25:00.636 --> 00:25:05.397\ncentOS 6.7 amd64.\n\n471\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.200\nAnd we'll just go ahead and do that.\n\n472\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:11.730\nRight?\n\n473\n00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.210\nSo now that we have those variables,\n\n474\n00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.430\nthose are going to get stored for\nlater usage here.\n\n475\n00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.626\nBut it means I don't have to remember the\nUUID when I need to bring it up later, nor\n\n476\n00:25:22.626 --> 00:25:26.857\nthe name when it asks me for that, as long\nas I remember what these variables are.\n\n477\n00:25:26.857 --> 00:25:30.705\nSo write these things down because they\nwill help you when you get to that point.\n\n478\n00:25:30.705 --> 00:25:35.750\nNow, I need an install, the source files,\nright, to be able to install.\n\n479\n00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:41.360\nSo then, xe cd-list.\n\n480\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.160\nAnd now you'll see where there's all\nof my isos that I have access to.\n\n481\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.204\nThe one that I want is, well, there's 6.5.\n\n482\n00:25:50.204 --> 00:25:53.455\nI think there's a 6.7 in\nhere If I can find it.\n\n483\n00:25:56.099 --> 00:26:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Eval, let's see.\n\n484\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:05.672\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here, at least, I just\nwent by a 6.7 something, there it is.\n\n485\n00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:09.832\nThis is that 6.7 minimal install,\n\n486\n00:26:09.832 --> 00:26:13.345\none that I want available here.\n\n487\n00:26:13.345 --> 00:26:18.265\nSo I want this particular UUID here,\n\n488\n00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:22.238\nis the one I wanna highlight.\n\n489\n00:26:22.238 --> 00:26:27.207\nAnd then I'm just gonna create another\nvariable called ISO cuz that's the one\n\n490\n00:26:27.207 --> 00:26:28.720\nI am gonna end up using.\n\n491\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.420\nSo I'm just creating a list of variables\nthat will help me to be able to\n\n492\n00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.550\ninstall this in.\n\n493\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.030\nJust trying to make sure that\nwe've got everything ready.\n\n494\n00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.144\nNext thing, of course,\nis gonna be the network adaptor.\n\n495\n00:26:40.144 --> 00:26:41.673\nSo I need network-list.\n\n496\n00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:46.672\nNow you can see which one that\nyou want to attach this to.\n\n497\n00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:48.915\nI'm gonna attach it to\nthe production network.\n\n498\n00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:54.079\nSo instead of me trying to\ncreate everything once again,\n\n499\n00:26:54.079 --> 00:27:00.120\nI'm going to just create a variable\non network, using that UUID.\n\n500\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.230\nSo notice that everything that\nI'm doing depends on that UUID.\n\n501\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.660\nThat's why I told you at the beginning\nit's important that we remember this here.\n\n502\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.980\nAnd this is all getting\neverything ready for\n\n503\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.096\nthe install that we have available to us,\nall right?\n\n504\n00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:17.420\nNow there's a couple other options\nthat we have to be able to do here.\n\n505\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.630\nWe could ahead and assign a MAC\naddress if we wanted to as well.\n\n506\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.400\nBut I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna\nallow it to generate its own MAC address.\n\n507\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.794\nBut I do want to do a vm-disk-list.\n\n508\n00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.746\nNow I'm creating the actual\nvirtual hard disc name.\n\n509\n00:27:36.746 --> 00:27:39.734\nAnd that's gonna be vm=.\n\n510\n00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:44.570\nNow I'm calling on that variable,\non the name that we had earlier.\n\n511\n00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.290\nAnd now it will generate it for me.\n\n512\n00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.314\nAnd you'll end up seeing that\nI have these two options.\n\n513\n00:27:51.314 --> 00:27:56.647\nOne, VBD, and\nthe other one is going to be the VDI.\n\n514\n00:27:56.647 --> 00:28:01.184\nAnd I need to create another\nvariable off of this VDI.\n\n515\n00:28:01.184 --> 00:28:08.657\nSo, very simply, VDI, Oops, too many.\n\n516\n00:28:08.657 --> 00:28:10.480\nDon't wanna add too many\nif I don't have to.\n\n517\n00:28:14.388 --> 00:28:17.480\nAdd that in,\nverify that I got everything ready.\n\n518\n00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.180\nSo creating all of these variables,\nyou might think, really.\n\n519\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.530\ndo we need all of that?\n\n520\n00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.740\nTo a point you do, okay?\n\n521\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.730\nNow the great thing is,\nnow that we have everything ready and\n\n522\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.260\nwe've got it set into variable,\n\n523\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.830\ncreating the VM itself in the command\nline really is just about six commands.\n\n524\n00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.120\nAnd then we'll kinda be done\nhere in terms of seeing it.\n\n525\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.070\nAnd then we'll be able to verify.\n\n526\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.572\n&gt;&gt; Check it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll be able to check and\n\n527\n00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:41.610\nsee if everything is working here, okay.\n\n528\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:48.680\nSo here we go to xe, and then vm-cd-add.\n\n529\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.345\nSo this is saying what are you gonna do?\n\n530\n00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:56.494\nI'm gonna actually set this up to\nadd in the CD that I want, uuid.\n\n531\n00:29:00.028 --> 00:29:03.140\nHere I'm gonna call upon the variable\nthat I made at the very beginning.\n\n532\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.068\nMake sure I do that.\n\n533\n00:29:06.068 --> 00:29:09.020\nAnd then cd-name.\n\n534\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:14.458\nAnd this is gonna equal\nthe ISO variable that I don't\n\n535\n00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:19.907\nhave [LAUGH] to worry about\nremembering the UUID for.\n\n536\n00:29:19.907 --> 00:29:22.570\nIf I didn't have that,\nI'd have to scroll back and find that or\n\n537\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.580\nat least I wrote it all down.\n\n538\n00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.660\nSo at this point, I should be able\nto press, oops, it's not found here.\n\n539\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:31.680\nLet me,\n&gt;&gt; CVM.\n\n540\n00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, here we are,\nwe have an error that we found.\n\n541\n00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.200\nBut I figured out what I did wrong.\n\n542\n00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.535\nAnd what ended up happening here, wben we\nstart to take a look, i s that I named\n\n543\n00:29:43.535 --> 00:29:47.305\nthis variable and I assigned the UUID\nto this variable called ISO.\n\n544\n00:29:47.305 --> 00:29:50.232\nWhen I did so,\nI went back in my notes and I checked and\n\n545\n00:29:50.232 --> 00:29:53.490\nI have actually assigned\nthe ISO the wrong thing.\n\n546\n00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.010\nI need to assign the label\nname instead of the UUID.\n\n547\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.700\nAnd if I assign the UUID,\nhere is what ends up happening instead.\n\n548\n00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.780\nSo you can see right here,\nI went ahead and corrected this.\n\n549\n00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.200\nI changed it to that name label, and\nonce I did, I was able to run the command.\n\n550\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.320\nAnd once you actually run that command,\nthat now allows us to use that ISO for\n\n551\n00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.030\nthe install that we need.\n\n552\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:21.230\nSo now it's essentially setting like\na CD into the DVD tray of your computer.\n\n553\n00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:25.030\n&gt;&gt; And you're just putting the system\ninto the location where to find\n\n554\n00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.700\nthat virtual DVD.\n\n555\n00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's correct, yep,\nsince we really have now got\n\n556\n00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:34.290\nthe virtual machine built, we now need\nto get us install source ready to go.\n\n557\n00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.420\nWe haven't configured everything yet,\nwe're just about there.\n\n558\n00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.851\nNext line is for us to do a little bit\nof the parameters of the VM here, and so\n\n559\n00:30:41.851 --> 00:30:44.296\nthis one's is a little bit longer here.\n\n560\n00:30:44.296 --> 00:30:46.949\nWhere it's a vm- param-set.\n\n561\n00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:50.050\nAnd it's telling me that we're\nsetting some system parameters here.\n\n562\n00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.220\nAnd this is gonna be HVM for us,\nwhich I assume is gonna be a hardware,\n\n563\n00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.860\nor hypervisor VM boot policy,\nis what this one is.\n\n564\n00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.613\nSo hypervisor boot-policy.\n\n565\n00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:10.043\nAnd now we have to set this\none to actually boot up to\n\n566\n00:31:10.043 --> 00:31:13.383\nthe BIOS order, is what we need.\n\n567\n00:31:13.383 --> 00:31:16.676\nAnd behind my head what you're\nactually gonna see is me calling upon\n\n568\n00:31:16.676 --> 00:31:17.786\nthat variable again.\n\n569\n00:31:17.786 --> 00:31:22.402\nuuid=, call upon\nthe variable that I had set\n\n570\n00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:29.261\nearlier, And it accepts that.\n\n571\n00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:31.220\nSo now we've got a boot order in mind.\n\n572\n00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.328\nWhen this this thing is ready to boot up,\n\n573\n00:31:33.328 --> 00:31:35.870\nit's saying,\nfollow us in the normal BIOS, and\n\n574\n00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.029\nthat means usually CD and then going to\nthe hard drive, is what we have set here.\n\n575\n00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:46.750\nThen we need to create the virtual\ninterface for the network adaptor, xe vm.\n\n576\n00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:51.878\nAnd then this one is Actually not VM.\n\n577\n00:31:51.878 --> 00:31:54.194\nvif-create.\n\n578\n00:31:54.194 --> 00:32:01.433\nvif stands for\nvirtual interface create vm-uuid.\n\n579\n00:32:01.433 --> 00:32:04.706\nAnd we're gonna make this one be the same\n\n580\n00:32:04.706 --> 00:32:09.044\nthing as the variable that\nwe had set earlier, UUID.\n\n581\n00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:13.283\nAnd then the network-uuid.\n\n582\n00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:19.008\nThis is gonna be set to the network\nvariable that I had created.\n\n583\n00:32:19.008 --> 00:32:21.820\nIf I can spell it correctly.\n\n584\n00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.820\nI don't know why I have such a hard\ntime spelling network, but I do.\n\n585\n00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.713\nOops.\n\n586\n00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:28.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just one letter\naway from not working, right?\n\n587\n00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least, at least one letter.\n\n588\n00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.146\nAnd we're telling it to take a look and\nmake this my first network device.\n\n589\n00:32:38.146 --> 00:32:42.980\nThe great thing is if I had a Mac address\nlike I'd said earlier during this,\n\n590\n00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.650\nI can assign a Mac address\nright now if I want to.\n\n591\n00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.383\nBut if this is brand new and\nI don't know what the Mac address is or\n\n592\n00:32:50.383 --> 00:32:54.969\nI don't know what I want it to be, this\nwill end up generating a new uuid for me.\n\n593\n00:32:54.969 --> 00:32:59.280\nAnd now you'll see that there's another\none that gets set here for us, and\n\n594\n00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.020\nthis is for the network adapter itself.\n\n595\n00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.575\nSo we're creating this new virtual\nnetwork adapter is what we're doing, or\n\n596\n00:33:04.575 --> 00:33:06.175\nthe new virtual switch.\n\n597\n00:33:06.175 --> 00:33:11.355\n&gt;&gt; And can I go ahead and create\nan alias or a variable for that as well?\n\n598\n00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:13.535\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can,\nexcept that we don't need it anymore.\n\n599\n00:33:13.535 --> 00:33:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n600\n00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanted to, you could now\ngo ahead and create another one, and\n\n601\n00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.955\nset that aside if you're gonna use it for\nsomething else later.\n\n602\n00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:20.965\nI don't have anything we're using it for.\n\n603\n00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:22.815\nHere's the longest one that we have.\n\n604\n00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:23.405\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n605\n00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:28.140\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why is because we're\nactually inside of the command prompt.\n\n606\n00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.860\nThey want us to be able to set the memory,\nright?\n\n607\n00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.370\nSo we have a couple of options.\n\n608\n00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.350\nWe can either use dynamic memory or\nstatic memory.\n\n609\n00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:40.130\nHere we're gonna set both, and then we can\nchoose which one we wanna do later on.\n\n610\n00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.076\nSo here it's gonna be xe and\n\n611\n00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:47.947\nthen vm-memory-limits -limits.set and\n\n612\n00:33:47.947 --> 00:33:51.800\nnow this is where I type in dynamic.\n\n613\n00:33:54.258 --> 00:33:58.420\n&gt;&gt; And then we specify our maximum amount,\nthe size?\n\n614\n00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this is where\nthe case sensitivity matters.\n\n615\n00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:08.023\nI know it's strange but\nmost of you are used to doing this but\n\n616\n00:34:08.023 --> 00:34:12.788\nI'm not as used to doing this,\nwhich is MiB.\n\n617\n00:34:12.788 --> 00:34:13.937\nThat's the important-\n&gt;&gt; Men in Black?\n\n618\n00:34:13.937 --> 00:34:15.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be Men in Black here.\n\n619\n00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:18.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we also want to, of course,\n\n620\n00:34:18.138 --> 00:34:19.050\nset the dynamic.\n\n621\n00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:25.495\nMinimum size, and let's say that\n\n622\n00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:30.495\nthe minimum here, I want 512 MiB.\n\n623\n00:34:30.495 --> 00:34:36.700\nAlso, I'm gonna set the static-max and\nwe'll do the same thing, 4096MIB.\n\n624\n00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.823\nAnd just as an example here,\n\n625\n00:34:41.823 --> 00:34:48.658\nwe'll do the minimum as well, okay?\n\n626\n00:34:48.658 --> 00:34:52.930\nNow on this one, the reason why I wanted\nto show you the case sensitivity of this\n\n627\n00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:57.137\nthing is that when you look at this whole\nthing, if you're trying to type it in\n\n628\n00:34:57.137 --> 00:35:01.050\nquickly like I did by reading off\nthe commands that I typed in.\n\n629\n00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.569\nNow I press Enter, and\nit tells you something right away.\n\n630\n00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:05.900\nIt says, look,\nit failed to actually do this.\n\n631\n00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.330\nThe great thing is the error tells you\npretty much exactly where to go and\n\n632\n00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.790\nwhat's happening.\n\n633\n00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.480\nAnd you can actually see the possible\nsuffix is actually the problem.\n\n634\n00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:21.050\nAnd that is because I did not\nchange that to a capital B.\n\n635\n00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.410\nOnce I change it to a capital B,\noops, I was expecting integer.\n\n636\n00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.580\nGuess what else I did?\n\n637\n00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.440\nForgot the equals sign.\n\n638\n00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:28.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n639\n00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.590\n&gt;&gt; So now, well, let's see,\nfound matches in multiple VMs.\n\n640\n00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.520\nMultiple required here.\n\n641\n00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.536\nAll right, so now we've got a new error,\n\n642\n00:35:40.536 --> 00:35:43.538\nlet me make sure that I've\nactually typed this in correctly.\n\n643\n00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:48.269\nMemory max, it probably doesn't\nlike the fact that I did exact\n\n644\n00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:50.510\nmemory sizes to as far as I know.\n\n645\n00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:56.145\nLet me try and\njust do what I had originally set there.\n\n646\n00:35:56.145 --> 00:35:57.697\nDynamic-max, just trying to verify.\n\n647\n00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.550\n&gt;&gt; So you're just trying\nto round it off right now?\n\n648\n00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n649\n00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.770\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm trying to see\nif this is what did it or\n\n650\n00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:07.830\nI may have to change the sizes of these\nthings and that's fine if I do that.\n\n651\n00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.060\nLet me just change this to two.\n\n652\n00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Thousand?\n\n653\n00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we'll do the same thing here.\n\n654\n00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n655\n00:36:17.178 --> 00:36:21.300\n&gt;&gt; That way we just make sure that it's\nnot saying you can't use that much memory.\n\n656\n00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.105\nSomething like that, whatever it might be.\n\n657\n00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:30.481\nMultiple required to\ncomplete this operation.\n\n658\n00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:35.380\nAll right, so\nI did figure out what I did wrong.\n\n659\n00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.740\nJust like anything else,\nwhen I entered in those parameters,\n\n660\n00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.480\nI forgot to make it specific\nto what I wanted to.\n\n661\n00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.760\nSo let's take a look at my machine again.\n\n662\n00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.530\nSo, there it is.\n\n663\n00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.200\nIt's saying, multiple required\nto complete the operation.\n\n664\n00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.080\nI just forgot to add\nthe UUID in here at the end.\n\n665\n00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.550\nAnd that is more than anything just\ncommon user error on Ronnie's part.\n\n666\n00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:00.890\nThe idea of me trying to type and talk\nat the same time is never a good thing.\n\n667\n00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Nothing like pressure?\n\n668\n00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's never a good thing.\n\n669\n00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.480\nSo now, unless, again i have to kinda\ndo the should, this should work.\n\n670\n00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.910\nLook at that, it actually did worked and\nthat's all I was missing.\n\n671\n00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.100\nJust trying to type too fast and\n\n672\n00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.930\nall my stuff is too close\ntogether is what happened.\n\n673\n00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:21.155\nOnce we do this, one last thing here,\nor actually two last things,\n\n674\n00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:26.115\nso this is our penultimate ending here,\nwhich is vdi-resize.\n\n675\n00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:31.590\nSo now I'm saying, how big do I want\nto make my drive for right now.\n\n676\n00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.496\nUuid, and\nnow I'm gonna set this up for the-\n\n677\n00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:37.002\n&gt;&gt; Oops.\n\n678\n00:37:37.002 --> 00:37:38.041\n&gt;&gt; VDI.\n&gt;&gt; Equals.\n\n679\n00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:44.903\n&gt;&gt; The VDI variable that\nI had created earlier,\n\n680\n00:37:44.903 --> 00:37:51.978\ndisk-size=, this time I'm gonna do 15.\n\n681\n00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:56.320\nGigabytes, right here too.\n\n682\n00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.429\nThe one that's uncommon for\nme is the GIB or MIB.\n\n683\n00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:03.997\nI know it's fairly common but\nnormally when I'm tying as either MB or\n\n684\n00:38:03.997 --> 00:38:06.770\nGB so, always want to make sure I do that.\n\n685\n00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.630\nAnd now we've actually created a VM.\n\n686\n00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.570\nNow can I prove that?\n\n687\n00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.550\nIf I go back to Xen center,\nI can now see, there it is.\n\n688\n00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:23.520\nIt's actually in my CentOS library,\nso you can see those here.\n\n689\n00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.430\nThe other things I can see if I click\non memory is I haven't any memory yet,\n\n690\n00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.600\nbut you can see there's the maximum size.\n\n691\n00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.140\nThe two gigs that we just set.\n\n692\n00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.319\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I noticed that that little\nred warning sign, so what does that mean?\n\n693\n00:38:38.319 --> 00:38:40.852\nIs this machine just sitting there\nwaiting for us to do something?\n\n694\n00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:43.294\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it's just waiting for\nme to start it and\n\n695\n00:38:43.294 --> 00:38:45.940\nhere's the network adapter\nthat we also put in.\n\n696\n00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.210\nSo everything looks like it's ready to go.\n\n697\n00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.400\nBut if I'm working from the command\nprompt, I need to start it.\n\n698\n00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.910\nSo I can start it from\nthe XenCenter right now.\n\n699\n00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.013\nSo here I just typed in xe vm-start, and\n\n700\n00:39:00.013 --> 00:39:04.358\nthen tell it exactly which machine I want,\n\n701\n00:39:04.358 --> 00:39:09.686\nwhich means I'm calling\nupon that variable again.\n\n702\n00:39:09.686 --> 00:39:13.103\nAnd now as long as I type that in\ncorrectly, notice it's not saying, yes,\n\n703\n00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:14.623\nyou started this successfully,\n\n704\n00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:16.870\nbut it didn't ask-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] We didn't get a failure.\n\n705\n00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.400\n&gt;&gt; And now you can see,\nlook at that, there it is.\n\n706\n00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.475\nIt went ahead and it started.\n\n707\n00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:21.340\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo!\n\n708\n00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.694\n&gt;&gt; And it is on XenServer01.\n\n709\n00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:29.240\nIf I go to the console,\nyou'll see where it popped in.\n\n710\n00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.950\nThere is that CentOS disk\nthat I popped it into.\n\n711\n00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.610\nAnd now this is where\nyou can come back in and\n\n712\n00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.100\nyou can start telling\nit to do the install.\n\n713\n00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.970\nSo you can successfully do the majority\nof it, right, from right here.\n\n714\n00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.500\nI don't think I can.\n\n715\n00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.270\nI can't walk through the actual\nmenu system at this point,\n\n716\n00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.620\nand tell it to do all\nthe things it needs to do.\n\n717\n00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.530\nBut at least going to this point here,\nyou can get it installed inside\n\n718\n00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.990\nof your Xen servers using the XE\ncommand line from that point.\n\n719\n00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.919\nAnd then once you have everything ready\nto go, you can now switch on over, and\n\n720\n00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:08.253\nallow the rest of the install to happen,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n721\n00:40:08.253 --> 00:40:11.077\nSo it is a little bit\nof an involved process.\n\n722\n00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:15.300\nAre most of us ever going to\nreally do this very often?\n\n723\n00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.740\nProbably not.\n\n724\n00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.536\nBut it is a great emergency tool for\none reason only.\n\n725\n00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:22.630\nIt's locked up and\nyou know I need to rebuild a VM.\n\n726\n00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.362\nOr I need to begin to learn some\nmanagement outside of the Windows\n\n727\n00:40:26.362 --> 00:40:28.030\ngraphical user interface.\n\n728\n00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.160\nThis is the way for\nyou to go and you can do that.\n\n729\n00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.130\nBut that should be at least something\nto get you started enough so\n\n730\n00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.960\nthat you can do this, okay?\n\n731\n00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.527\nSo, take a look around.\n\n732\n00:40:38.527 --> 00:40:42.398\nThere's pretty of documentation\non using the XE tools,\n\n733\n00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:47.530\nZ or how do they pronounce it, out there,\nand don't be afraid to try it.\n\n734\n00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.532\nIt's right there, it's available for you.\n\n735\n00:40:49.532 --> 00:40:53.805\nAnd you can see that you're not gonna\nenter in something wrongly to the point\n\n736\n00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:56.360\nwhere it's gonna run and\ncause some damage.\n\n737\n00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.084\nIf you enter it in wrongly,\nit's just gonna give you an error.\n\n738\n00:40:59.084 --> 00:41:01.240\nSo you're not gonna hurt it.\n\n739\n00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.931\nUnless you're intentionally trying\nto break it, then yes, you will.\n\n740\n00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:08.391\nBut for most of us, what we get is\nan error and we just look up the error and\n\n741\n00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:10.550\nwe'll be able to figure that out.\n\n742\n00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.850\nBut that's what we actually end up doing.\n\n743\n00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.628\nSo there's another way for\n\n744\n00:41:13.628 --> 00:41:17.427\nyou to add in some management\nskills into your Xen server.\n\n745\n00:41:17.427 --> 00:41:20.962\nAnd from that point,\nyou'll actually be working on it and\n\n746\n00:41:20.962 --> 00:41:23.932\nbeing able to now not be\nlimited only to Windows.\n\n747\n00:41:23.932 --> 00:41:27.430\nBut to just about anywhere that you\nwant to go, you'll be able to manage it.\n\n748\n00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.998\n&gt;&gt; That was a lot of syntax to remember,\nRonnie.\n\n749\n00:41:29.998 --> 00:41:33.197\nBut thank goodness we do have the support\nfrom Citrix, of those forums and\n\n750\n00:41:33.197 --> 00:41:35.260\nso forth that you had mentioned before.\n\n751\n00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.050\nGood old thing called the Internet, right?\n\n752\n00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.572\nSo thank you so much for taking the time\nto walk us through this process and\n\n753\n00:41:40.572 --> 00:41:43.188\nshow how to go ahead and\nexecute via the command line.\n\n754\n00:41:43.188 --> 00:41:44.864\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n755\n00:41:44.864 --> 00:41:48.860\nI wanna go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular show.\n\n756\n00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.770\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n757\n00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.342\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to you Citrix XenServer show,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose In\n\n4\n00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.240\nthis episode we will be looking at how\nto monitor and update your XenServers.\n\n5\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.850\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n6\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.470\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n7\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.709\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back.\n\n8\n00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:29.550\nGreat to be here as we\ncontinue on in XenServer.\n\n9\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.870\nAnd so, Ronnie, we've already talked\na little bit about monitoring.\n\n11\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.310\nBut why is it so important?\n\n12\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.430\nWhy are we emphasizing it\neven more in this episode?\n\n13\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.140\nWell, we need to make sure that we\nunderstand that part of the process of\n\n14\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.100\nmaintaining and of course managing the\nsystems is also to keep them up to date,\n\n15\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.840\nbecause things change over time.\n\n16\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.060\nAnd even though people try to\nbuild the perfect software,\n\n17\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.470\npeople start using it and they report\nbugs in them and then they fix them and\n\n18\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.940\nthey have to be able to push those out\nthat really help the end user out or\n\n19\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.080\nthe companies that\nare using the products out.\n\n20\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.190\nSo it's always very important that\nwe have the ability to understand\n\n21\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.690\nthat we need to take a look at updates.\n\n22\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.310\nWe need to be able to push them in and\n\n23\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.630\nthen we also need to\nmonitor our systems too.\n\n24\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.180\nIt's an environment in which we're in\nwhich is a very mobile environment,\n\n25\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910\na very scalable environment.\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.590\nSometimes we end up ramping up\nmuch quicker than we thought.\n\n27\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.660\nWe end up putting more strain on\nthe hardware than we believed and\n\n28\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.100\nnow we need to continue to scale that up.\n\n29\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.550\nWe need to be on know what our pressure\npoints are and the only way to do that of\n\n30\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.780\ncourse is to monitoring those systems,\nespecially during the heavy usage.\n\n31\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.290\nMaking sure that everything is still\nworking or is our system gonna\n\n32\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.940\ncrumble underneath the work load that\nwe have on our regular networks?\n\n33\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.100\nSo we wanna make sure that when it comes\ndown to it, we're monitoring really for\n\n34\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100\na couple of reasons.\n\n35\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340\nThe first one absolutely\nis the idea of performance.\n\n36\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.300\nAnd the second one is what we call\nhealth more than anything else.\n\n37\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.090\nIs everything healthy?\n\n38\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.320\nIs everything running?\n\n39\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.090\nAnd that's one of the great features\nthat we do have right here inside of\n\n40\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.770\nCitrix XenServer as well.\n\n41\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.250\n&gt;&gt; So if I were going to the Doctor and\nI'm doing my regular health check-up.\n\n42\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.790\nWhat are some things I'd\nwan to be checking out?\n\n43\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.370\nI don't know my blood pressure,\nand things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.920\nSo what are we looking at on our\nactual systems for their check-ups.\n\n45\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.402\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the hard thing\nhere inside of Citric XenSenser.\n\n46\n00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:20.180\nThere is really not a lot for\nyou to look at, but\n\n47\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.090\nit at least gives you some\nmonitoring performance overall for\n\n48\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.360\nthe basic four that we always monitor for\non computer performance.\n\n49\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.300\nWe can look at CPU utilization.\n\n50\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.100\nWe can look at disk I/O.\n\n51\n00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.960\nWe can end up looking at the amount\nof RAM or RAM utilization.\n\n52\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.000\nAnd of course, our network connections.\n\n53\n00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.140\nThose four impact network, or excuse me,\n\n54\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.760\ncomputer performance or server\nperformance, virtualization performance\n\n55\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.460\nmore than any other thing that\nwe can combine and put together.\n\n56\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.620\nSo having a good study understanding\nof how our computers are affected,\n\n57\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.720\nwhat is it if I bring on a single or\nturn on another single VM and\n\n58\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.030\nnow my utilization jump up from\nlet's 40% all the way up to 80%,\n\n59\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.810\nwe gonna figure out why stuff\nlike that is happening.\n\n60\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.720\nAnd also on the RAM usage,\nis there something else going on?\n\n61\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.070\nNetwork usage, what is happening\nthere that's causing that?\n\n62\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.240\nAnd those are some of the things\nthat we definitely need to monitor.\n\n63\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.670\nBut even though the system\nshows us a nice summary and\n\n64\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.880\nan overview,\nit doesn't show us a lot of detail.\n\n65\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.900\nThis can be both frustrating and it can\nalso be deceiving at the same time too.\n\n66\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.050\nThat the deception part,\n\n67\n00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.870\nI won't say deceiving that's kind of the,\nis not showing us enough.\n\n68\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.370\nThat's what I should say,\nit can be blinding, I should say that.\n\n69\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.507\nBecause it really doesn't give you\nanything beyond just a summary.\n\n70\n00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:42.828\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout before I continue to talk and\n\n71\n00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:44.400\nnever get anywhere.\n\n72\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.410\nSo when we start talking\nabout the ideal performance,\n\n73\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.010\nlet me select XenServer zero one,\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n74\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.540\nAnd then we, of course,\ncan see, well, a lot.\n\n75\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.840\nIf I just select the performance tab,\nthis is what we're generally looking for.\n\n76\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.110\nRegular CPU performance in\na nice little chart form.\n\n77\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.572\nNotice it gives me this on two\nminute intervals, which is great.\n\n78\n00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:09.578\nIt gives me that ability to see so on all\nfour of the CPU cores that are available.\n\n79\n00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:13.719\nI have a little tiny, tiny tiny spike\nright here, I wouldn't even consider it\n\n80\n00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.230\nmuch of a blip, but maybe concerning for\nyou, for one reason or another.\n\n81\n00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.786\nOn memory performance you can also\nsee that utilization of my memory is\n\n82\n00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:28.964\nright up there at the 8 GB mark at\nthis point, and that is because I\n\n83\n00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:35.018\njust turned on in our previous segment\nAnother CPU or another VM right here.\n\n84\n00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:38.083\nI didn't do any of the install,\nexcept started to walk through it, but\n\n85\n00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:40.370\nwe had just finished installing that.\n\n86\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.100\nAnd network performance,\nI can also see spikes here too.\n\n87\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.410\nBut there's really not a lot, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.025\nAt the bottom it's just a summary\nof everything that goes on,\n\n89\n00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:51.150\nover a timeline and\nthat's what we really want.\n\n90\n00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.680\nWe want to be able to monitor\nperformance over time.\n\n91\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.850\nSo that we can see when something\nhas actually occurred and\n\n92\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.820\nthat they all occurred together or\ndid they occur at different times.\n\n93\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.080\nAnd, of course, we're monitoring, pretty\nmuch, well, the basics that we have.\n\n94\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.370\nNotice that it doesn't really give\nme things like disc IO very much\n\n95\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.960\nas far as just a chart goes.\n\n96\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.501\nBut if I select, let me see here.\n\n97\n00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:15.900\nNope, it's search.\n\n98\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.300\nIf I go to the search tab,\n\n99\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.260\nit's right here where I can see\ndisk average max kilobytes.\n\n100\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.470\nSo, it's here that you can see\nessentially, how much the average\n\n101\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.150\nkilobytes that we're averaging, but\nit's really not, it's not detailed,\n\n102\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.440\nit's kind of very summarized and\nvery sparse in between.\n\n103\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.140\nSo, how do you get more information\nout of Citrix XenServer?\n\n104\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.629\nWell, the way that you do so is simple.\n\n105\n00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.502\nAll you have to do is open up that one\ncomponent in your network that nobody ever\n\n106\n00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:51.840\nwants to open up which\nis your network wallet.\n\n107\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.700\nOnce you open up your network wallet, you\nwill now have access to a lot more data\n\n108\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.760\navailable to you, and\na monitoring service that's available,\n\n109\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.030\nthat can help you analyze the data on\nyour individual XenServers as well.\n\n110\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Are you talking about the support that\nwe saw in the beginning of the episode,\n\n111\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.340\nfor the additional features and\nthey provide support?\n\n112\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.690\nOr something different\nlike a third-party tool,\n\n113\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.580\nthat someone in our chat or\nWhomever had cued in about.\n\n114\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.995\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is actually something that\nis a feature that they've brough in in 7.0\n\n115\n00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:24.553\nthat they really would love for\neverybody to do.\n\n116\n00:06:24.553 --> 00:06:27.322\nBut it's only really available for\nthe Enterprise users and\n\n117\n00:06:27.322 --> 00:06:30.670\nthat what's we wanna focus\nin on just briefly here.\n\n118\n00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.900\nSo, the way that we do that.\n\n119\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.760\nIf I click on Tools up here on the top.\n\n120\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.600\nNotice this second option\nthat says health check.\n\n121\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.510\nWell, this is not normally available\ninside of your standard licensing here.\n\n122\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.100\nIn other words,\nthe free one that you have access.\n\n123\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.970\nHere it says,\n\n124\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.972\nhealth check will automatically upload\nserver status to Citrix Insight Services\n\n125\n00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:54.749\nbased on a predefined schedule\nconfigured on your Xen Pools.\n\n126\n00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.680\nNow you can select that, and\n\n127\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.590\nthen you can essentially have\nthe information uploaded to them.\n\n128\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.670\nThey will send you back insight and\nreports and stuff, help you to Xen,\n\n129\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.010\nfigure out everything,\nget everything that you want to.\n\n130\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.300\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n131\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.445\nYou can do that.\n\n132\n00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever that means.\n\n133\n00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:14.325\nIs that from The Lion King?\n\n134\n00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:16.731\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]?\n\n135\n00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.086\nI don't know, I'm not a yogi.\n\n136\n00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:18.873\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n137\n00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:21.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So at this point I just selected enroll\n\n138\n00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:25.120\nnow and looked at the stuff\nthat they have available here.\n\n139\n00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.190\nI'm actually schedule it and it says how\noften, so here's frequency two weeks,\n\n140\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.990\ntime and day, exactly when.\n\n141\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.150\nAnd, this means that they requires you\nto have the XenServer credentials.\n\n142\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.380\nAccounts that you've all ready paid for\nready to go and\n\n143\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.350\nthat will give you the insight that you\nneed to go ahead and have that feature in,\n\n144\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.170\nbut if you don't have it your only\nother option is simple, close.\n\n145\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.440\nSo, why don't they consider that\na part of just the regular standard,\n\n146\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.850\nwell really what they're expecting at\nthis point right in Citrix XenServer.\n\n147\n00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.700\nIs they're not really expecting you\nto monitor too much on the host side.\n\n148\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.650\nThey think that they've given\nyou enough to say look,\n\n149\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.350\nyou can base most of the performance\nmonitoring off of what we give you.\n\n150\n00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.570\nBut they really want you focusing\nin on the individual detailed VMs.\n\n151\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.900\nSo if I select inside one of these,\n\n152\n00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.560\nI'm selecting one that's actually\nalready done and finished here.\n\n153\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.890\nSo let's take the Windows Server here.\n\n154\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.150\nNotice that I also have a performance tab\nand it also gives me the same information,\n\n155\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.970\nbut this one adds in disk performance with\nthe actual monitoring here or the chart.\n\n156\n00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.809\nSo you can see right here where there's\n\n157\n00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.688\nperiods of reads where it\nhas spiked multiple times.\n\n158\n00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:42.060\nSo here's my Disk I/O that\nwe're actually seeing.\n\n159\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.530\nAnd, of course, we can also see\nthe network utilization, memory, and\n\n160\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.480\nperformance.\n\n161\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.070\nSo on every VM we also have\nthe ability to monitor for that and\n\n162\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.930\nthat's really what they would\nwant you to focus it on more.\n\n163\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.700\nBut just like anything else if\nyou're already doing that there,\n\n164\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.330\nmore than likely, your best detailed\nreport is inside of the VM and\n\n165\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.750\nnot necessarily from here.\n\n166\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.630\nSo this gives you a nice little\npicture in the note review.\n\n167\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.102\nBut if you really want the details of\nwhat's happening inside of that VM,\n\n168\n00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:09.841\nyou should probably use the inside.\n\n169\n00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.850\nWell no, you just use the tools that are\nbuilt into Windows to do the monitoring\n\n170\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.458\ninstead and\n\n171\n00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:18.888\nthat's what will probably give you\nthe more detailed report that you want.\n\n172\n00:09:18.888 --> 00:09:23.370\nThe monitoring,\nnot exactly designed for it.\n\n173\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.430\nPay for it, then yeah, a little bit\nmore monitoring is available for you.\n\n174\n00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't the only thing we\nwanted to cover in this show, was it?\n\n175\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.480\nWe said monitoring and updating.\n\n176\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.280\nAnd Ronnie, you showed us a list of\nthe different types of operating systems,\n\n177\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.080\nthe versions, I should say.\n\n178\n00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.975\nAnd it was quite extensive.\n\n179\n00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:44.120\nIt seems like, are their developers\nreally working that diligently, and why?\n\n180\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.190\nIs it because they're really just\ntrying to push out those normal\n\n181\n00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.240\ntype of things that we see with updates,\nfixes, features, something like that?\n\n182\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.960\n&gt;&gt; They really do, because it's just as\nimportant that we secure the hosts and\n\n183\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.480\nthat we have all the features available on\nthe hosts that we also want available for\n\n184\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.660\nour VMs.\n\n185\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.260\nSo, they do have diligence there now\nin getting everything up and running.\n\n186\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.910\nAt one point on their free services\nthe only way that you could apply updates,\n\n187\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.617\nbecause it was 100% free,\nwas never through the actual Xen Center,\n\n188\n00:10:13.617 --> 00:10:15.610\nit's kind of strange, but it's true.\n\n189\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.260\nYou could go and download their updates\nand then once you download their updates,\n\n190\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.450\nyou'd have to go into the command,\nthe XE prompt.\n\n191\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.110\nAnd once you're actually in there, then\nyou could install the updates manually.\n\n192\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.580\nDoesn't sound great, but\nthey're like look, it's free,\n\n193\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.510\nyou should be able to figure this out-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.606\n&gt;&gt; And get that done, and\n\n195\n00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:32.589\nnot worry about it.\n\n196\n00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:35.593\nOnce you get into the Enterprise version,\nthough,\n\n197\n00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.700\nnow you can download those\nupdates directly into Xen Center.\n\n198\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.950\nAnd then pushed them out in\nthe way that you need to as well.\n\n199\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.460\nToday inside of Xen Center,\nwhen you start opening it,\n\n200\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.410\nyou have two different updates\nthat you need to pay attention to.\n\n201\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.490\nAnd that's what we wanted to make sure of.\n\n202\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.860\nSo as far as updates go, when we update,\nwe're normally updating for fixes.\n\n203\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.070\nStuff that people reported wrong,\nlike, let's fix that.\n\n204\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.000\nAnd of course, security updates.\n\n205\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.300\nNever bypass security updates.\n\n206\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.230\nMake sure you actually\nkeep those up to date.\n\n207\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.686\nIf you run an HA pool, right,\na high availability pool,\n\n208\n00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:11.926\nor just a regular resource pool,\nmake sure that if you\n\n209\n00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:15.893\nupdate one XenServer you update\nthe other ones in the pool, too.\n\n210\n00:11:15.893 --> 00:11:18.340\nThe same level patches, everything.\n\n211\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.740\nDon't decide to update one completely and\nthen leave the other ones.\n\n212\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.380\nYou're gonna do it and\n\n213\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.770\nsince they're actually clustered together,\nmake sure you do them all.\n\n214\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.800\nSo don't do piece meal,\nmake sure you actually do them all and\n\n215\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.980\ndo what you need to.\n\n216\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.950\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n217\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.570\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhat about us today with the free version?\n\n218\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.979\nDo we have to learn the command\nline to be able to do that?\n\n219\n00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:41.300\nWell, nice enough though in 7.0,\nyou don't really have to do that.\n\n220\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.671\nLet me show you where you go and\nsee these different tools.\n\n221\n00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:48.771\nSo here on the side of Xen Center,\nif I go and click on Tools,\n\n222\n00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:54.450\nnotice that there are a couple of\ndifferent ones that are available here.\n\n223\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.207\nOne is of course install the update, and\n\n224\n00:11:57.207 --> 00:12:02.084\nnotice that there is also what they\ncall a rolling pool upgrade as well.\n\n225\n00:12:02.084 --> 00:12:05.158\nSo if there are upgrades that\nare available and you have a pool,\n\n226\n00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:07.652\nit says look,\nI will upgrade these things for you,\n\n227\n00:12:07.652 --> 00:12:11.010\nI'll not do them at the same\ntime actually as a rolling pool.\n\n228\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.170\nMake sure everything gets sent\nout the way that needs to.\n\n229\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.280\nSo let's select that one first,\n\n230\n00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.550\ncuz that one's the one that's\na little bit harder to think about.\n\n231\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm a little confused.\n\n232\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.791\nI'm just thinking, so\nwhat we're gonna go ahead and\n\n233\n00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.860\nupdate these machines sequentially?\n\n234\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.840\nOr how does that work?\n\n235\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty much saying that.\n\n236\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.860\nSo throughout your entire pool,\nit will go ahead and do it, but\n\n237\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.810\nit won't do it all at the same time.\n\n238\n00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.580\nSo it will manage it,\nit will allow you to do it.\n\n239\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.209\nBut notice there's a lot of\nchecks before it will do that.\n\n240\n00:12:37.209 --> 00:12:38.977\nSo we're not gonna walk\nthrough this whole thing,\n\n241\n00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:40.880\ncuz I don't wanna stop\nthe entire show just to do this.\n\n242\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.060\nBut you can see here, it says,\nallows you to upgrade all of the servers,\n\n243\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.390\none server at a time,\nin such a way that resources and\n\n244\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.250\nservers offered by the pool remain\navailable throughout the process.\n\n245\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; And this is important.\n\n246\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.980\nThis is very important in a production\nnetwork that you don't just say,\n\n247\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.520\nall right, everybody guess what?\n\n248\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.640\nNo access to the servers.\n\n249\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.541\nWhy?\nBecause we're upgrading everything.\n\n250\n00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:03.110\nNo, that sounds silly.\n\n251\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.060\nSo they give you this ability and\ninstead of you trying to figure out how to\n\n252\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.980\ndo the rolling up date to where\nevery service is available.\n\n253\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.640\nIn other words, you're making sure, what?\n\n254\n00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.520\nThat you're managing it to where that\nVME needs to be moved off of this one.\n\n255\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.350\nSo I can upgrade, and if anything\nhappens then I can roll it back.\n\n256\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.050\nThis thing lets us do this, they went and\nautomated essentially the process here and\n\n257\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.640\ngot everything ready.\n\n258\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.260\nSo walk through that.\n\n259\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.720\nIt should lead you through\nevery process that you need to.\n\n260\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.280\nSo I'm not gonna work about that for\nright now.\n\n261\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.292\nThe other one that's usually more\nimportant because this applies, of course,\n\n262\n00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:35.359\nnot only to the pool.\n\n263\n00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:39.823\nBut the individuals XenServer as well and\nthat's kind of what you see on those\n\n264\n00:13:39.823 --> 00:13:42.912\nsmall shops as you don't\nnormally see a clustering,\n\n265\n00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:47.970\nnormally see an individual's XenServer\non most of the small places.\n\n266\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.150\nThe cool thing about it that,\nthat I really like about this,\n\n267\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.130\nis what I just said, download everything\non start, notice it gives you.\n\n268\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.739\nThis warning, I guess.\n\n269\n00:13:57.739 --> 00:14:00.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before you attempt to install\n\n270\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.870\nany software updates.\n\n271\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.713\nIt says what, look at all the stuff you\nshould think about doing before you do so.\n\n272\n00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Back up.\n\n273\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.320\nImagine that.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n274\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.044\nBack up your sources.\n\n275\n00:14:09.044 --> 00:14:10.490\nWho would have thought that?\n\n276\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.260\nYou heard network administrator,\nyour system administrator.\n\n277\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.000\nYou should have thought about that.\n\n278\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.730\nDownload the relevant updates and\n\n279\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.190\nensure that you can access\nthe update file from your computer.\n\n280\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.500\nThat makes sense, high availability is not\nenabled on any pool where you intend to\n\n281\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.580\napply the updates as well.\n\n282\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.220\nSo, its saying that individual servers,\nif youre doing this and\n\n283\n00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.880\nthey're not in a pool, okay.\n\n284\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.090\nMake sure you do that, but if they are,\n\n285\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.150\nyou might want to choose\nthe rolling update instead.\n\n286\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.250\nEnsure that you're logged in as the pool\nadministrator or pool operator and\n\n287\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.250\nyou're not using the local or\njust using the local route account.\n\n288\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.500\nDon't log in with any other\naccount when you do this.\n\n289\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.320\nMake sure it's actually\nthe root account instead.\n\n290\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.340\nFrom this point, you select Next and\nthis is where you can select the updates.\n\n291\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.390\nSo remember I told you in earlier\nversions, I don't know exactly how early,\n\n292\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.390\nprobably back in version five or so.\n\n293\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.476\nYou had to manually do this,\nand bring everything up.\n\n294\n00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:03.680\nNotice this says Public Availability?\n\n295\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.470\nFixes for user authentication.\n\n296\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.010\nYou will also have fixes for\nthe virtual GPU here.\n\n297\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.860\nTo the tool stack, MTP, the installation.\n\n298\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.060\nThere's many of them that\nare actually available for you.\n\n299\n00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.418\nAnd, of course, before you do any of this,\nyou should take a look at them.\n\n300\n00:15:20.418 --> 00:15:22.340\nIt also gives you the ability\nto go to the webpage.\n\n301\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay, does it give you the option to, I\nsee that bottom radio button where you can\n\n302\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.450\nindividually select those, but if you keep\nthat top one selected, can you omit or\n\n303\n00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.190\nkinda customize which ones you want to\ndownload or is it like a one all package.\n\n304\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, as far as I know you can\nselect whichever one you want.\n\n305\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.978\nSo you can select that one or not.\n\n306\n00:15:40.978 --> 00:15:43.640\nAnd I don't think it allows you\nto apply all of them at one time.\n\n307\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n308\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.628\n&gt;&gt; So it could be where you have some, but\nit doesnt give you that ability to say.\n\n309\n00:15:48.628 --> 00:15:51.077\nYeah, I don't see one that says omit, but\n\n310\n00:15:51.077 --> 00:15:54.770\nI think when you select it you\nactually just select one at a time.\n\n311\n00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.620\n&gt;&gt; Got it!\n\n312\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.330\nNow, before we take a look at\nthat cuz we're not, once again,\n\n313\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.700\nwe're not doing this one.\n\n314\n00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.830\nI wanted to show you some of\nthe different ones that are here.\n\n315\n00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.600\nMake sure,\nthis is one of the easiest ways.\n\n316\n00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.060\nGo directly over to Citrix's\nsupport knowledge center.\n\n317\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.520\nAt the top, there's a software update and\nit tells you, right here, hotfix for\n\n318\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.280\nXenServer 7.0.\n\n319\n00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.390\nNotice it gives you this list\nof recommended hot fixes and\n\n320\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.870\nthis one was just modified\nnot too long ago.\n\n321\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.600\nWell, look at that and\nwhich we mean is today.\n\n322\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:34.240\nNow you can see and select the proper\none and this gives you that list.\n\n323\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.800\nSo now you can go through and\nsee which one really applies for\n\n324\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.490\nwhat you want to do.\n\n325\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.040\nSo instead of just selecting all of them\nand going, I'm just gonna apply all of\n\n326\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.520\nthem, make sure you select the one that\nyou really do need in terms of fixing.\n\n327\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.250\nApply those first and then you can go back\nthrough and start applying the updates.\n\n328\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:56.330\nNormally, inside of XenCenter if you've\nhad the paid option If will tell you\n\n329\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.370\nright when you log in and\nyou'll see, I can't\n\n330\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.260\nremember if it's up here in the upper\nright-hand corner or down here in this.\n\n331\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.540\nI think it's actually up here.\n\n332\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.828\nIt'll tell you, Citrix update awaiting,\nor waiting, or something like that.\n\n333\n00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.761\nThat means for you to apply,\nbut that's for\n\n334\n00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:15.260\nonly when you have spent the money\nto upgrade to that license as well.\n\n335\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:20.060\nBut, it's much more easy than it\nwas at one point in time to do.\n\n336\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.570\nSo, it just allows you to do\nthe installs the way that you need to.\n\n337\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.150\nFrom that point,\nmaking sure your machines are up-to-date.\n\n338\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.580\nThe host machine is up-to-date.\n\n339\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.966\nAnd, the only other thing that\nI would recommend, right,\n\n340\n00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:38.861\nis that if you do end up updating,\nlike XenServer itself from 7.0 to 7.1.\n\n341\n00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:43.480\nInside of the individual VMs you\nmight find out something after\n\n342\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.110\na while that the guest tools that\nyou installed no longer work.\n\n343\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.510\nSo that means you might have to\ngo ahead and remote desktop in,\n\n344\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.980\nand it's gonna look funky and strange.\n\n345\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.380\nUninstall those,\nput it back in the new guest tools and\n\n346\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.070\ninstall the latest version.\n\n347\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.600\nA lot of times you'll see what\nit tell you is mismatched\n\n348\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.450\nversions\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n349\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.200\n&gt;&gt; Or even the new ones might just say,\nyeah, make sure you do that.\n\n350\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.492\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou go through and do that for\n\n351\n00:18:10.492 --> 00:18:14.929\nall of your particular VMs as well,\nand that will keep everything nice and\n\n352\n00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:17.000\nthe parity that needs to be-\n&gt;&gt; All the same page.\n\n353\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Keep up to date.\n\n354\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.480\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful, yep.\n\n355\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.570\n&gt;&gt; And that's essential, especially\nunder virtualization environment.\n\n356\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.070\nYou definitely wanna make\nsure that all that happens.\n\n357\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.520\nBut it is a big part in\nunderstanding the monitoring and\n\n358\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.790\nupdating of the Citrix XenServer\nitself as well as Xen Center.\n\n359\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.710\nThat it's even an update to\nXen Center right now that's awaiting,\n\n360\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.060\nwhich is to Xen Center 7.01.\n\n361\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.930\nAnd you'll see that inside of the VMs,\nthat it says, you're connecting in or\n\n362\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.720\nit may tell you, you need to actually\nyour Xen tools along with it.\n\n363\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.210\nThat means you'll have to do that.\n\n364\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.750\nSo it's fairly helpful, is what I\nwant to say, when you do the updates.\n\n365\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.210\nBut it's even better now\nthat you don't have to use\n\n366\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.289\nthe XE command line to\nmake everything work.\n\n367\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\nit looks like we've begun our journey.\n\n368\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.910\nYou walked us through\nthe entire process and\n\n369\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.590\nthen we're at the end of the road here.\n\n370\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.530\nYou showed us how to monitor and\nupdate so I appreciate that,\n\n371\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.970\ntaking the time to come in and\ndo that with us.\n\n372\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.860\nAnd I appreciate you,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n373\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.510\nAnd good luck with your\nXenServer in the future.\n\n374\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.320\nThank you so much.\n\n375\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.313\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n376\n00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:19.040\nRemember I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n377\n00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n378\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.069\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n379\n00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:28.934\n[MUSIC]\n\n380\n00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
