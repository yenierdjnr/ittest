right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:38,180\nWelcome back to another\nfantastic episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,160\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,340\n>> How's it going tonight Nate?\n\n8\n00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,150\n>> Yeah, pretty good Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,020\n>> Yeah?\n>> Yeah pretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,720\nIt's a nice day outside.\n\n11\n00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,470\n>> It is gorgeous.\n\n12\n00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,060\n>> The birds were flying and\nchirping and the sun is shining.\n\n13\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,430\nAnd you can see those little solar flares,\nwalking by in the glasses, you know.\n\n14\n00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,220\n>> Nice, kind of a magical moment.\n\n15\n00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,190\n>> Yeah, it only feels like 106 degrees\noutside [LAUGH] here in Florida,\n\n16\n00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,810\nnice balmy 104% humidity or something.\n\n17\n00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,160\nSo, it's nice.\n\n18\n00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,920\nWe like it.\n\n19\n00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,480\n>> Yeah, it's nice.\n\n20\n00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,860\nYeah, you start sweating almost instantly.\n\n21\n00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,970\n>> Yep.\n\n22\n00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,430\nSo, we are now in our episode here.\n\n23\n00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,930\nContinuing on with the idea\nof virtualization,\n\n24\n00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,870\nthis time we're gonna take a look\nat the idea of Citrix XenServer.\n\n25\n00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,070\nSo, we did another complete series on\nthe idea of Microsoft's HyperV, and\n\n26\n00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,020\nnow we're moving in to the open\nsource world of XenServer as well\n\n27\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,750\nas we get started too, right.\n\n28\n00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,410\nYep.\n\n29\n00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,360\n>> All right.\nSo, with XenServer, right, so\n\n30\n00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,970\nbefore we get into installing it and\nsetting it up, Ronnie,\n\n31\n00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,710\nI think we should revisit virtualization\nand just kind of where we're at and\n\n32\n00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,480\nwhat we're doing with it.\n\n33\n00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,030\n>> I think that would be a great idea,\n\n34\n00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,920\nagain, repetition is kinda\nthe key of us learning.\n\n35\n00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320\nSo the idea of visiting, or revisiting,\n\n36\n00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,170\nthe concepts of virtualization,\nis actually gonna help us out,\n\n37\n00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,060\njust in case we have people that\nwent directly to our episode here,\n\n38\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,700\ninstead of going through the HyperV, we of\ncourse, would love for you to watch both.\n\n39\n00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,630\nYep.\n\n40\n00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,350\nAll right, so you know what?\n\n41\n00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,350\nLet's do this.\n\n42\n00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,890\nLet's start off with a drawing.\n\n43\n00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,860\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n44\n00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,310\n>> So,\nI'm gonna use my amazing paint skills,\n\n45\n00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,990\nand we'll mark up a little drawing here.\n\n46\n00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:24,060\nAnd explain the differences between\na type one and a type two hypervisor.\n\n47\n00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,710\n>> Okay.\n\n48\n00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,220\nYeah.\nSo when we get into the idea of\n\n49\n00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,224\nvirtualization here, right, we wanna make\nsure that we understand that concept\n\n50\n00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,860\nof what we are really trying to do.\n\n51\n00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,730\nWe are trying to make sure we\ncan use all of the hardware\n\n52\n00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,440\nto the optimized performance that we can.\n\n53\n00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,000\nIn other words,\n\n54\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,130\nthat we want to take advantage of the\nhardware that's actually before us here.\n\n55\n00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,050\nAnd the way that we do that is by\nimplementing some type of virtualization\n\n56\n00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,250\nsoftware or layer if you want to.\n\n57\n00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,150\nAnd those are what we call\nthe idea of hypervisors here.\n\n58\n00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,080\nSo we're going to describe the way\nthat hypervisors work and then we'll\n\n59\n00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,630\ntake a loot at some other things on how we\nactually deal with them and how they work.\n\n60\n00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,935\nA little more specifically, XenServer.\n\n61\n00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n62\n00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,710\nAlright, so on my PC here,\nlet's go ahead and fire up paint.\n\n63\n00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,360\n>> Paint.\nAll right, paint.\n\n64\n00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,980\nOkay so here we go.\n\n65\n00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,807\nSo we will start off with\na type two hypervisor.\n\n66\n00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:22,850\nAs we get our little square tool here,\nI'll draw a box in about that large.\n\n67\n00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:30,508\nAnd that tool here and\nwe'll click there between, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,750\nMake this a little bit larger.\n\n69\n00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,790\nOkay, here we go.\n\n70\n00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,740\nSo this box here will\nrepresent our system hardware.\n\n71\n00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,320\nRight?\nSo the actual bare metal physical\n\n72\n00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,020\ncomponents.\n\n73\n00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,520\nThat we have.\n\n74\n00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,370\nAnd when we install something.\n\n75\n00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,560\nAll right, so we'll put this here and\nthen, all right.\n\n76\n00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,060\nSo this will be our.\n\n77\n00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:00,290\nOperating system.\n\n78\n00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,790\nSo whether this is Windows or Linux or\n\n79\n00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,110\nwhatever have you, in this scenario\nwe'll just call it Windows.\n\n80\n00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,640\nAlright, so\nnow we have our operating system that is\n\n81\n00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,308\non top of this system hardware.\n\n82\n00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,385\nAll right?\n\n83\n00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:16,466\nAnd then, actually,\n\n84\n00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:21,012\nwe'll do a type two hypervisor.\n\n85\n00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,480\nAlright, then we have the hypervisor.\n\n86\n00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,270\nNow, this hypervisor it sort of acts\nlike a traffic cop, more or less.\n\n87\n00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,625\nIt accepts calls from the virtual machines\nand it passes it on to our operating\n\n88\n00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,517\nsystem which we'll call this one\nWindows 8, cuz I like Windows 8.\n\n89\n00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,184\nAnd then,\n\n90\n00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:48,090\nWIndows 8 will then pass that on the\nsystem hardware to make that connection.\n\n91\n00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,680\nAnd on top of that, let's see we'll\ndo a little circle this time.\n\n92\n00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,665\nYou know, I am running a bit out\nof room here, come to think of it.\n\n93\n00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,865\nWell, this is gonna go south kinda fast.\n\n94\n00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:08,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n95\n00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,540\nSo over here we'll call this one CPU\nin that little quadrant over there.\n\n96\n00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,250\nAll right.\n\n97\n00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,230\nSo a network card over there.\n\n98\n00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,450\nWe got RAM in that quadrant.\n\n99\n00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,410\nYeah, and now it's starting to go on\ntop of each other, that's fine though.\n\n100\n00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,610\nAnd then our disk drive.\n\n101\n00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,880\nAll right.\n\n102\n00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,845\nSo this are will be this little quadrant\nhere [LAUGH] will represent our virtual\n\n103\n00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:32,910\nmachine.\n\n104\n00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,530\nSo our virtual machine then is\nbuilt on top of that hypervisor.\n\n105\n00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,390\nSo what essentially the hypervisor is\ndoing for us is virtualizing hardware.\n\n107\n00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,670\nIt's taking our physical hardware and it's\ndoing what is called an extraction, right.\n\n108\n00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,020\nThe idea of saying we're representing\nwhat the hardware looks like\n\n109\n00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,370\nin this software environment for us.\n\n110\n00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,640\nThe reason why we want to do that is so\nthat we can actually go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,590\ninstall an operating system\ninside of that virtual computer.\n\n112\n00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,450\nSo Nate is showing us this\nfirst idea of the hypervisor\n\n113\n00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,640\nthat we call the type two hypervisor,\nwhich runs on top of the hardware and\n\n114\n00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,580\non the host operating system, the one\nthat's ready on your computer here.\n\n115\n00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,750\nYep.\n\n116\n00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,370\n>> All right.\n\n117\n00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,360\nSo this 480, the type two hypervisor for\nthese virtualization technologies,\n\n118\n00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,090\nthese would be like Oracle or\nVirtual Box works this way, Microsoft,\n\n119\n00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,900\nVirtual PC, things like a DOS box and\nother type emulators.\n\n120\n00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,360\nEmulators, yeah, that's more or\n\n121\n00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,690\nless what a type two hypervisor\nkind of functions like.\n\n122\n00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,410\nAn emulator and if you put in a,\nI don't know, SNES Genesis ROMs, you know.\n\n123\n00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,220\nYou load up and emulator so\nyou then you can play those ROM games.\n\n124\n00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,610\nAnd the same sort of idea,\nalong with this type two hypervisor.\n\n125\n00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,640\n>> Yup.\n\n126\n00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,940\n>> Now to contrast that so\ndraw a little box over here.\n\n127\n00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,220\nI got our text box.\n\n128\n00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,150\nTake that back to 20.\n\n129\n00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,510\nAnd so this right here would be our.\n\n130\n00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,563\nOur System Hardware, and [SOUND] And\n\n131\n00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:11,951\nthen on top of our system hardware,\n\n132\n00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:16,486\nwe will then have the hypervisor will\n\n133\n00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:21,192\nthen go on top of our system hardware.\n\n134\n00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:25,578\nAnd then on top of that,\nlet's do just a little box this time.\n\n135\n00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:31,556\nI always do two boxes, three boxes.\n\n136\n00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,430\nAll right, there we go.\n\n137\n00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,025\nSo this will be our our\nhost operating system.\n\n138\n00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:46,705\nSo we guest one, stretch this box out.\n\n139\n00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:56,582\nAll right, so for a type one hypervisor.\n\n140\n00:07:56,582 --> 00:08:01,921\nNow on this one here the hypervisors\nSits below the host operating system,\n\n141\n00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:08,240\nor whatever operating system is running\nat the time that Hypervisor is installed.\n\n142\n00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,550\nAnd then all the guest operating\nsystems are installed right alongside\n\n143\n00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,820\nthat host OS.\n\n144\n00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,790\nOne of the main benefits\n\n145\n00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,110\nof a type 1 Hypervisor is the idea\nof speed and performance.\n\n146\n00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,080\nSo when Guest 1, when it has to make\na call down to System Hardware whether\n\n147\n00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,780\nit needs to access the hard drive or\nto access it's memory or\n\n148\n00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,690\nwhatnot, that goes directly\nto the hypervisor.\n\n149\n00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,970\nWhich then connects it to the system\nhardware as opposed over to the type\n\n150\n00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,830\ntwo hypervisor, it's gotta go through\nthe operating system to get down to that\n\n151\n00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,110\nsystem hardware, so it's a bit more,\nyeah, a bit more, a lot more, a lot more\n\n152\n00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,670\nperformance and better for production type\nenvironments and those sorts of things,\n\n153\n00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,400\nwith a type two, those work great for\neffort for just testing things.\n\n154\n00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,930\nIf you want to spin up a VM\nreal quick to see something or\n\n155\n00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,480\nlook at like a beta operating system.\n\n156\n00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,380\nOr something like that,\nI mean works fantastic.\n\n157\n00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,720\nBut it's going to be a virtual machine\nthat people are going to be working with.\n\n158\n00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,510\nOr if you need to push it out to some\nclients or something that's gonna\n\n159\n00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,660\nbe a bit more long-term,\nthe Type 1 hypervisor is the way to go.\n\n160\n00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n161\n00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,440\nSo in this environment,\n\n162\n00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,580\nwe're actually seeing that virtualization\nreally takes two forms for us.\n\n163\n00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,830\nBoth of them involve this idea\nof the hypervisor, right?\n\n164\n00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,920\nSo with the idea of virtualization,\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n165\n00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,150\nInstead of actually having to\nrun one operating system and\n\n166\n00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,650\nthen partitioning it off, installing\nanother operating system on there,\n\n167\n00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,060\nto reboot in that other operating system\nwe can run multiple operating systems at\n\n168\n00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,710\nthe same time on that one set of\nhardware for us to actually do it.\n\n169\n00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,460\nSo imagine that in a traditional\nPC environment and\n\n170\n00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,920\nregular server environment,\nwe have a hardware.\n\n171\n00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000\nWe install that operating\nsystem on top of it.\n\n172\n00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,470\nThen, that way, we actually load on\nthe application that we need to.\n\n173\n00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,880\nWhat we're now able to\ndo is take that model.\n\n174\n00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,800\nInstead, and now run a hypervisor\nunderneath it which will give us\n\n175\n00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,250\na software emulation of the hardware, and\n\n176\n00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,450\nthen we can now install the operating\nsystem in that software environment, and\n\n177\n00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,650\nthen also on top of the operating system,\ninstall the applications that we need.\n\n178\n00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,700\nSo this allows for\n\n179\n00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,590\nus to take advantage of the hardware\nfully, is what we're really going at.\n\n180\n00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,600\nAnd a lot of the actual basic types of\nhypervisors that we started off with\n\n181\n00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,780\nwere what we call the type two hypervisor.\n\n182\n00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,060\nBecause we need an operating system to\nrun an application that could run this,\n\n183\n00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,330\nthat was that.\n\n184\n00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,500\nBut as it started to mature,\nthe idea of virtualization,\n\n185\n00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,890\nthey started figuring out ways to actually\nrun that emulation on top of the hardware,\n\n186\n00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,550\nand then provide a software environment\nfor every operating system.\n\n187\n00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,780\nEven the ones that's actually controlling\nthe way that some of the features work in\n\n188\n00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,791\nterms of storage and networking.\n\n189\n00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,853\n[INAUDIBLE] Here,\n\n190\n00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,820\nwhere you see Nate actually writes\nthe host operating system over here.\n\n191\n00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,310\nThat controls the way the actual guest\noperating systems can also access\n\n192\n00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,940\nthe hardware as well.\n\n193\n00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,190\nInstead we can run that all on top and\nthat now means that we don't have to have\n\n194\n00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,220\ndedicated hardware just for\nthe host operating system.\n\n195\n00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,100\nWe can actually run every single\nthing as a virtual machine as well.\n\n196\n00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,260\nSo, when we start talking about the need\nto take advantage of the hardware that\n\n197\n00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,605\nwe have, there's a particular statistic\nthat Nate always mentions here, so\n\n198\n00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,880\nit' s a good one for\nus to actually think about.\n\n199\n00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,350\nSo, Nate, let's talk about\nthat statistic for a moment.\n\n200\n00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,890\nWhat's that statistic?\n\n201\n00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,460\n>> So one that I got from Don Pezet,\nand I'm not sure where he got it,\n\n202\n00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,300\nhe said it so I guess it's a legit number.\n\n203\n00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,190\nBut so he said that 80% of the people\nuse just 20% of their systems.\n\n204\n00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,330\nSo you, think about today some of\nthese computers incredibly powerful.\n\n205\n00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,100\nQuad core CPUs, 16 gigabytes of RAM,\nbunch of hard drives thrown in there\n\n206\n00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,570\nwhat my mom uses here computer for\nis email and\n\n207\n00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,680\nlooking at funny pictures on the internet,\nright?\n\n208\n00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,050\nYou could get away with an iPad just\nto do that, just to write email.\n\n209\n00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,410\nBut these are full blown desk top PC's.\n\n210\n00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,880\nVery powerful.\n\n211\n00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,330\nPCs and a lot of their\nutilization just goes unused.\n\n212\n00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just kinda just sits there\n\n213\n00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,440\nidle a lot of the time.\n\n214\n00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,660\nSo then what better way to\nleverage the power of our PCs just\n\n215\n00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,470\nsitting there than to load up, you know,\nthree or four operating systems on there.\n\n216\n00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,910\nAnd multi task the heck out of it.\n\n217\n00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,170\n>> Most home users are not gonna see the\nbenefit in terms of virtualization because\n\n218\n00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,220\nthey don't need it.\n\n219\n00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,400\nIf you're like me at home and you're just\nplaying Freecell, you don't really need\n\n220\n00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,580\nthat quad core i7 processor and the 16\nGigs of RAM and the two terabyte hardrive.\n\n221\n00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,890\nYou really don't need anything like that\nat all, but if you're now inside of a work\n\n222\n00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,420\nenvironment where you're actually\nrunning multiple physical servers.\n\n223\n00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,760\nWhen I first started,\n\n224\n00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,580\nwe had a whole rack of servers, I think\nlike eight or ten different servers.\n\n225\n00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,710\nEach one of those servers had\nan operatingt system installed on them and\n\n226\n00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,600\nwere running some Windows Server\n2003 at the time when they\n\n227\n00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,220\nfirst kind of got started here.\n\n228\n00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,740\nWe would actually run a domain\ncontroller on one server.\n\n229\n00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,540\nWe would then actually run DHCP on\nanother server at that point in time and\n\n230\n00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,650\nthen we started combining roles together.\n\n231\n00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,470\nBut, we actually needed other things\nlike a file server or anything else.\n\n232\n00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,770\nWe actually had to buy more servers.\n\n233\n00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,640\nWell, there came a point in time where\nthe virtualization technology started\n\n234\n00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,870\ncoming on the scene.\n\n235\n00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,700\nWhen now, what we could do,\n\n236\n00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,210\nis we could buy a higher performing\nserver that we had, and the one\n\n237\n00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,130\nthat we ended up getting when we first\nstarted moving towards virtualization.\n\n238\n00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,460\nWas equal to about five or six of those\nservers in terms of the hard drive space\n\n239\n00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,230\nand the RAM that we had, and the overall\nCPU was much better higher performing.\n\n240\n00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,620\nAnd what we could do is actually\nuse this virtualization technology\n\n241\n00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,200\nto run them all on that one single server,\nokay?\n\n242\n00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,070\nSo now we have multiple different\noperating systems running simultaneously.\n\n243\n00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,640\nOn this one machine, we're able to use\nthat hardware and the way that it was\n\n244\n00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,860\nactually designed to work a lot better and\nactually optimized the usage of it.\n\n245\n00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,330\nSo in a production environment,\nthat's what you're gonna see,\n\n246\n00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,510\nis that virtualization is pretty much,\nwhat you see everywhere,\n\n247\n00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,420\nespecially on the back end of things.\n\n248\n00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,990\nNot so much on the workstation side,\nbut when you start connecting networks,\n\n249\n00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,605\nvirtualization is pretty\nmuch the key here.\n\n250\n00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:27,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n251\n00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,070\n>> Yep.\n\n252\n00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,560\n>> So, Ryan, so let's think about this,\n\n253\n00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,090\nso let's think about\nthe client side of things.\n\n254\n00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,610\nSo, we've got in the business environment,\nwe're gonna have less physical servers,\n\n255\n00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,750\nand those guys generate less heat.\n\n256\n00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,580\nThey use less power.\n\n257\n00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,000\nAnd you get higher density and\nwhat not of,\n\n258\n00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,310\nI guess,\nmachines that we can fit in there and\n\n259\n00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,860\nhave a whole rack full of servers having\nmany racks full of physical servers.\n\n260\n00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,290\nBut what about a person that\njust needs to test something?\n\n261\n00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,890\nLike I mentioned an OS,\na brand new OS wants to test out.\n\n262\n00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,920\nWell, let's think about\nan old applications,\n\n263\n00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,510\nlike a line of business app\nthat has to run on Windows XP.\n\n264\n00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,330\n>> Right.\n\n265\n00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,110\n>> Well, you could have a dedicated\nbox that just runs Windows XP.\n\n266\n00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,580\nThat sits there,\nthat gets turned on every once in awhile.\n\n267\n00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,820\nBut then, just to run one app.\n\n268\n00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,400\nThat one is XP machine.\n\n269\n00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,880\nThere's a physical to virtual\npass that we can take.\n\n270\n00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,060\nAnd we can just run that app\ninside of Windows XP virtualized.\n\n271\n00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,780\nAnd so,\nwe can get rid of that one machine.\n\n272\n00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,280\nOr about, a tester, all right?\n\n273\n00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,708\nSomebody who needs to, a developer\nthat needs to test applications, or\n\n274\n00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,040\nto test certain hardware or what not.\n\n275\n00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n276\n00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,960\n>> Instead of having a whole bunch of\ndedicated machines for that sort of stuff,\n\n277\n00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,850\nit's really simple just to virtualize.\n\n278\n00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,600\nThat sort of thing.\n\n279\n00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,870\n>> Yeah, and that's actually a good\nphysical example that we can actually now.\n\n280\n00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,402\nFor us here at ITProTV, when we do get\nsupport tickets that come in saying,\n\n281\n00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,589\nwe can't actually can't\nsee the video here,\n\n282\n00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,409\nwhat we actually have is our\nweb kungfu master Rob Maghrib.\n\n283\n00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:09,346\nWhat he does is he asks what\nthe operating system is, and\n\n284\n00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:12,590\nwhat version of the browser\nthat we actually need.\n\n285\n00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,600\nAnd instead of Rob having the go and\nlook for\n\n286\n00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,440\none of those machines, we gave him the\nability to virtualize a Windows 7 machine\n\n287\n00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,960\nrunning Internet Explorer 9, right?\n\n288\n00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,830\nSo that way, he can actually have a true,\nreal one for one test here,\n\n289\n00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,300\nat actually getting access to the website,\nand seeing or\n\n290\n00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,320\nexperiencing that same problem\nin the same environment.\n\n291\n00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,020\nIf we didn't have that, right,\ndidn't have the ability to do that,\n\n292\n00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,280\nwe'd have to send Rob out to find\na machine, install Windows 7 on it,\n\n293\n00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,260\nmake sure it's running Internet Explorer\n9, make sure we're doing that.\n\n294\n00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,290\nBut now with this, it gives him the\nability whatever version of the operating\n\n295\n00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,273\nsystem that we need, if we really need to.\n\n296\n00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:51,478\nHopefully, nobody's running Windows 98,\nor ME, or something like that, but\n\n297\n00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,133\nit is possible, but\nwe probably wouldn't do that.\n\n298\n00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:58,522\nBut it gives us that ability to do\nsome testing and to provide that.\n\n299\n00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,527\nIn a production environment,\n\n300\n00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:05,534\nthe real benefit is the cost savings that\nwe have, as well as the idea to be able\n\n301\n00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:11,090\nto use those several thousand dollar\nmachines now, and again use them fully.\n\n302\n00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,190\nWe went from about ten servers at this\npoint, to where our current environment,\n\n303\n00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,710\nbecause we're using\nthe idea of virtualization,\n\n304\n00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,380\nto really about three servers\nis what we have here onsite.\n\n305\n00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,350\nSo it really did help reduce the power\nconsumption that Nate mentioned.\n\n306\n00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,450\nIt helped us to be able to actually run\nmore of the things that we needed to, and\n\n307\n00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,380\neven isolated instances, like certain\nsoftware that would only run in one\n\n308\n00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,450\nenvironment, but\nwouldn't run in anything else.\n\n309\n00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,900\nWe can actually do all that and not have\nto worry about buying another server or\n\n310\n00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,040\ndedicating another piece\nof machinery to it.\n\n311\n00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,802\nWe could run inside of our virtualization\nenvironment and we're up and ready to go.\n\n312\n00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,813\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:46,492\n>> Yeah.\n\n314\n00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:49,909\n>> All right Ronnie, so let's talk\nbriefly about hardware requirements.\n\n315\n00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,478\n>> Okay.\n>> Right so, we've said,\n\n316\n00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:57,665\nnow we want to virtualize a machine for\none need or another.\n\n317\n00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:01,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So what do we need on our PC to be able\n\n318\n00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,420\nto take advantage of\nthis kind of technology?\n\n319\n00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,620\n>> Yeah, so a lot of times when\nyou start taking a look at this,\n\n320\n00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,560\ndepending on the product that you're\nusing, we are now going to talk\n\n321\n00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,300\nabout the product that we're looking\nat which is Citrix XenServer.\n\n322\n00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,390\nCitrix XenServer is a very powerful\nproduct just like Microsoft has Hyper-V,\n\n323\n00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,920\nVMware has, well, VMware.\n\n324\n00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,480\nOkay.\n\n325\n00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280\nAnd all the stuff that\nit actually has with it.\n\n326\n00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,696\nThere are other players in the market,\nbut XenServer and Citrix, I mean Citrix,\n\n327\n00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:31,280\nXenServer, VMware, the ones that\nthey actually have out there,\n\n328\n00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,700\nas well as Hyper-V, these are kind of\nthe three big players in the market.\n\n329\n00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,160\nThere are some up and\ncomers that are actually coming along.\n\n330\n00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,230\nRed Hat has it.\n\n331\n00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,550\nOracle, again, is also working on one.\n\n332\n00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,412\nBut when we start taking\na look at it here,\n\n333\n00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:47,155\nCitrix XenServer is the one that we've\nchosen for this particular series as well.\n\n334\n00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:52,092\nSo we went through the idea of hypervisor\nto show you a kind of proprietary way\n\n335\n00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:55,215\nof doing this by using\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V.\n\n336\n00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:58,525\nNow we're taking a look at an open source\nproduct, which is Citrix XenServer.\n\n337\n00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,830\nNow you're going,\nI've never heard of Citrix XenServer.\n\n338\n00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,850\nWell the world of virtualization has.\n\n339\n00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,980\nThey've absolutely been one of the kind\nof leaders in terms of virtualization and\n\n340\n00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,220\nbeen out there a long time, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,840\nThey've been out there and\nthey've been performing so well that\n\n342\n00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200\nwhen it came down to choosing a product,\nwhether we were going to use Hyper-V, or\n\n343\n00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,960\nwhether we were actually\ngonna use XenServer here.\n\n344\n00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,620\nWe ended up choosing XenServer to do\nwhat we actually wanted to do, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,800\nSo when we talked about the idea\nof actually running XenServer,\n\n346\n00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,490\njust like any other thing that\nwe actually put on the computer,\n\n347\n00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,880\nthere has to be minimum\nhardware requirements.\n\n348\n00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:39,470\nWell XenServer is so\nincredibly confident about their product\n\n349\n00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,640\nthat they don't really list a ton of\nhardware requirements, because at the base\n\n350\n00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,010\nof it is some type of Linux foundation,\nand Linux operating system that we have.\n\n351\n00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,480\nBut what they pretty much\nsay in their source, and\n\n352\n00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,280\nif you go here to their website like I\nhave on Citrix.com and go to XenServer,\n\n353\n00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,430\nthe only thing that they really say is, as\nlong as the server was built In the last\n\n354\n00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:04,340\nthree years, you can probably actually\nrun anything that you want to, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,890\nIn the early days of virtualization\nwhere everything was highly specialized,\n\n356\n00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,380\nin other words,\nthe drivers were not there that we needed,\n\n357\n00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,050\nthey supported only a few products.\n\n358\n00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,560\nBut today, because of the maturity of\nvirtualization that we have today,\n\n359\n00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,180\nas long as it's built within the last\nthree years, you can pretty much run it.\n\n360\n00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,740\nNow, for us here in XenServer, that means\njust about any machine will actually work.\n\n361\n00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,810\nSo, I can actually run it on my laptop,\nbut there are some things on laptops that\n\n362\n00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,180\nare a little bit particular\nthat it may not recognize.\n\n363\n00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,970\nBut just about any PC, any server that you\nrun today, will be able to actually run\n\n364\n00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,830\nand install XenServer directly on\ntop of it, is what we'll have here.\n\n365\n00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,940\nOkay?\n\n366\n00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,980\nNow the other thing that we also need\nhere, if we are gonna begin to talk about\n\n367\n00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,019\nthis particular process here,\nis not only a machine to put it on, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,960\nUnlike the other way that we can\ninstall hypervisor, all right?\n\n369\n00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,600\nSo when we're doing\nthe Windows Server 2012,\n\n370\n00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,450\nwe had to actually run Windows Server and\nthen we installed the role.\n\n371\n00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,080\nIn Citrix XenServer, you don't do that.\n\n372\n00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,800\nWhat you do is you load the hypervisor\ndirectly on to the hardware itself.\n\n373\n00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,600\nThere is no underlying\nbase operating system for\n\n374\n00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,452\nus, in terms of what's in between\nthe hardware and the hypervisor.\n\n375\n00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:17,290\nIt's a hypervisor, and it's running\nessentially just kind of the bare minimum\n\n376\n00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,400\nof Linux behind it, but\nit really is just doing that on itself.\n\n377\n00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,060\nSo when we do put this on,\nit's gonna erase everything that you have\n\n378\n00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,730\non that particular computer, so you're\ndoing this in a testing environment,\n\n379\n00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,080\nyou need a computer that you can say,\nI can wipe it clean.\n\n380\n00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,770\nI'm not worried about any of the hard\ndrive space on there cuz it's gonna,\n\n381\n00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,770\nagain, install and\nwipe everything clean for us.\n\n382\n00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,500\nSo there's really not a lot in terms\nof basic hardware requirements.\n\n383\n00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,199\nNate?\n>> Mm-hm, yep, a few things also, as well,\n\n384\n00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:51,394\nwe have to have a 64 bit\nprocessor of course, and\n\n385\n00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:58,590\nwe do need the AMD virtualization,\nthat AMDV, and Intel has the VT?\n\n386\n00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,120\n>> Intel VT, yep.\n\n387\n00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,803\n>> So\nwe have to have that support in there.\n\n388\n00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,710\nYeah, that support.\n\n389\n00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,300\n>> There's a couple of different\nthings with this, right?\n\n390\n00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,670\nBecause we're actually talking about\nthe ability of virtualization, right?\n\n391\n00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,710\nWe pretty much have the idea of Linux\noperating system that we'll be running,\n\n392\n00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,090\nand really Windows operating system.\n\n393\n00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,190\nDon't get me wrong,\nthere's more than that, but for us,\n\n394\n00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,670\nthose are kind of the two major players\nin the virtualization world that we would\n\n395\n00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,870\nwant to virtualize the operating\nsystems and running them on.\n\n396\n00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,820\nOkay.\n\n397\n00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,200\nIf you're going to be running Windows\noperating systems in a virtualized\n\n398\n00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,900\nenvironment, the newer operating\nsystems really want the processor to be\n\n399\n00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,540\navailable to them, and so you have to have\nthat virtualization enabled technology.\n\n400\n00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,703\nThe Intel VT or the AMDV allows\nthe hypervisor again, to be able to give\n\n401\n00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:54,875\nthe operating system the access it needs\nto, okay, with those two technologies.\n\n402\n00:22:54,875 --> 00:23:01,530\nBut, let's say you go hey,\nI don't have a PC that will do that.\n\n403\n00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,700\nThen you're not gonna be able to install\nWindows operating systems that actually\n\n404\n00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,160\ncan be virtualized onto\nthat Citrix XenServer.\n\n405\n00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,870\nBut what can you do?\n\n406\n00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,360\nIf you don't have that, and you go,\nI don't have a particular PC that will\n\n407\n00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,900\nactually do that hardware assistance,\nor virtualization assistance.\n\n408\n00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,840\nYou can still run Linux virtual\ncomputers on a machine if you wanted to.\n\n409\n00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,430\nSo you can install a XenServer\ndirectly on those, and\n\n410\n00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,240\nyou can run Linux ones you just\ncan't do the Windows ones as well.\n\n411\n00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,850\nSo they really have kind of, I don't wanna\nsay they figured out everything, but\n\n412\n00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,880\nthey've given the opportunity here.\n\n413\n00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,030\nIf you wanna do a mixed environment,\nyou have to have that VT.\n\n414\n00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,930\nIf you wanna just do a Linux\nenvironment in terms of virtualization,\n\n415\n00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,520\nyou can pretty much run it\non anything you want to.\n\n416\n00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,070\nIt's pretty smart.\n\n417\n00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,250\nThe software.\n\n418\n00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,620\n>> Yeah, now to check to see\nif your system does have that,\n\n419\n00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,980\ngetting into the BIOS is the surefire\nway to check that you have it.\n\n420\n00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,340\nAnd also not only that, but to check\nto see that it is, in fact, enabled.\n\n421\n00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,751\nYeah, so that's done in the BIOS.\n\n422\n00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:06,066\nNow we do have a PC set up here, and\nI believe after the break we will We'll\n\n423\n00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:11,382\nget in and fire this guy up and we'll\nshow where that BIOS setting is at and\n\n424\n00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:15,620\nstart actually installing\nwhen we get to that point.\n\n425\n00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,110\n>> Cuz we do wanna run with the idea of\na Windows operating system on here so\n\n426\n00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,250\nwe want to make sure that\nthat's gonna be enabled.\n\n427\n00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,180\nSo when we get into the part where we\nbegin the installation process we'll\n\n428\n00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,020\ncheck out the BIOS and\nactually see where those features are.\n\n429\n00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,520\nJust about any machine, like I said,\nwhether it's server product, and\n\n430\n00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,740\njust about every PC, I'm not gonna\ntell every single one does, but\n\n431\n00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,590\njust about every single one today does\nallow you the ability to do some of that\n\n432\n00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,420\nvirtualization and the assistance there.\n\n433\n00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,890\nSo, you can actually see it, most of\nthe time it's disabled on most desk top\n\n434\n00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,195\ncomputers, though,\nif you're going to be doing this.\n\n435\n00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,760\n>> Yep.\n\n437\n00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,590\n>> All right, Ronnie, anything else left\nwith our basic overview of virtualization,\n\n438\n00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,890\nkind of what it is, how it works,\nwhy would we need to use it, and\n\n439\n00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,410\nkind of what we need on our PC to use it.\n\n440\n00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,480\n>> Well, just a little bit in terms\nof what we need to make sure of.\n\n441\n00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,750\nThe virtualization is\nsomething that every IT person\n\n442\n00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,410\nshould at least be familiar with.\n\n443\n00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,130\nOkay.\n\n444\n00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,610\nSo don't just say I'm\na desktop support technician.\n\n445\n00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,220\nI'll never have to worry about it.\n\n446\n00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,140\nThe environment that you'll be working\nwith will be supporting some type of\n\n447\n00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,450\nvirtualization.\n\n448\n00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,640\nNow, you may actually end\nup wondering at times,\n\n449\n00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,570\nwhen would I ever see that as\na desktop support technician?\n\n450\n00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,500\nWell, even though we're talking about\nthe idea of server virtualization here,\n\n451\n00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,590\nyou will run into what we call a virtual\ndesktop environment as well, where\n\n452\n00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,620\nyou imagine having a PC or what we call\na thin client and the actual people that\n\n453\n00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,215\nare sitting there using that workstation,\nthey're actually connecting to the server.\n\n454\n00:25:43,215 --> 00:25:46,515\nAnd they might have their own virtual\nmachine that they're connecting to and\n\n455\n00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:48,195\nthat's where you're actually\ngoing to see the support.\n\n456\n00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:51,830\nSo, don't just think because I'm\nsupporting just regular desktop or\n\n457\n00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,430\nN-users you don't have to worry about it,\nyou may actually have to do that.\n\n458\n00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,070\nSo it's better that you at least\nhave a concept and understanding\n\n459\n00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,350\nof what it is that we're gonna be\nshowing you and how it actually works.\n\n460\n00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,810\nEven if you're never actually\ngonna be in there configuring and\n\n461\n00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,160\nmastering it, it does help if you at\nleast are familiar with the technology,\n\n462\n00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,530\nbecause this is what you're\ngonna face in the real world.\n\n463\n00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,130\n>> Now as far as those N-users go Ronnie,\n\n464\n00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:19,380\nyou mentioned working with the virtual\ndesktop and with the thin clients.\n\n465\n00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,410\nNow here in the center we have rolled\nout a good number of thin clients,\n\n466\n00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,410\nreplaced a lot of aging Dell\ndesktop towers that we have with\n\n467\n00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,660\nthese thin clients,\nSome servers back there that host it.\n\n468\n00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,860\nNow as far as the N-users go right?\n\n469\n00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,570\nThe people that are working\non this thin client.\n\n470\n00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,770\nWhen they turn it on, right,\nit automatically makes that connection\n\n471\n00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,760\nto the server and\nthey start their remote desktop there.\n\n472\n00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,820\nAs far as the N-users go it\nlooks the exact same whether it\n\n473\n00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,790\nwith a stand alone PC or\nwith a virtualized environment.\n\n474\n00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,090\n>> Yeah, they'll never know really\nthe difference if you tell them.\n\n475\n00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,620\nAnd even if you tell them,\n\n476\n00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,420\nthey'll not be able to experience\nthe difference the majority of the time.\n\n477\n00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,090\nSo virtualization is coming and you're\nactually gonna see it more and more.\n\n478\n00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,220\nSo don't shy away from it just because\nyou say I'm never gonna get that level.\n\n479\n00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,690\nLearn it, take a look at it, and\n\n480\n00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,270\nkinda realize what's actually\nhappening in the background.\n\n481\n00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,230\n>> Yeah, and\nyou can virtualize switches and\n\n482\n00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,980\nvirtualize an entire\nlittle network altogether.\n\n483\n00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,640\n>> Pretty fancy stuff.\n\n484\n00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,812\nAll right, well good deal.\n\n485\n00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:22,390\nWell, we are up here on break time.\n\n486\n00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,970\nWhen we come back we'll get\nthis XenServer thing installed.\n\n487\n00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,100\nAnd we can whip up some virtual\nmachines and take a look at that stuff.\n\n488\n00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,630\n>> Sounds great.\n\n489\n00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,075\n>> Sweet.\nWe'll get to all that\n\n490\n00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,183\nstuff after the break.\n\n491\n00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:38,830\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n492\n00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,740\n>> I was going to say hey.\n\n493\n00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,860\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n494\n00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,090\nAll right, so where we left off,\n\n495\n00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,790\nwe were talking about virtualization and\nwhat it is.\n\n496\n00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,250\nWhy would we want it?\n\n497\n00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,920\nWhat kind of things can we use it for?\n\n498\n00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,010\nSo now we're going to get into\nXenServer and get it installed.\n\n499\n00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,350\nAnd get a bit more, what is it?\n\n500\n00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,650\nHow do we use it,\nstuff centered around XenServer.\n\n501\n00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,580\n>> Yep.\nAll right,\n\n502\n00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,920\nso when we start talking about the idea\nof choosing a virtualization technology,\n\n503\n00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,060\nXenServer is the one that we chose.\n\n504\n00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,280\nAnd there's a big reason why\nwe actually chose it here.\n\n505\n00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,650\nSo all my computer screen, let me show you\nthe big reason why we actually chose it.\n\n506\n00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,090\nThere it is.\n\n507\n00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,630\n>> It's free.\n\n508\n00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,780\n>> It's free, yep.\n\n509\n00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,964\nSo with XenServer, right, there's a lot\nof products that are actually free for\n\n510\n00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,940\nus, but XenServer is absolutely 100% free.\n\n511\n00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,990\nNow, they use to have different levels\nthat you actually would end up buying\n\n512\n00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,930\ninto, but since XenServer has now\nbecome part of a open source project,\n\n513\n00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,030\nthey again follow that same model.\n\n514\n00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,630\nSo the product itself is free,\nbut if you need 24 hour support,\n\n515\n00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,300\nand you need to have their ability to do\nall the things that they need to do to\n\n516\n00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,650\nsupport you, that's where they\nactually charge you money for it.\n\n517\n00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,672\nBut you yourself can actually\ngo right here to XenServer or\n\n518\n00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:55,500\nto citrix.com under the products there and\nXenServer and\n\n519\n00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,700\ndownload this, you'll have to register and\nthen they'll send you a link and\n\n520\n00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,400\nyou can download it immediately and\nget it ready to go.\n\n521\n00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,170\nNow XenServer's one of these\nunusual products here that we have.\n\n522\n00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,210\nA lot times today, in today's world in\nwhich we don't really have a lot of\n\n523\n00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,730\noptical drives to actually do anything\nwith, we normally can go ahead and\n\n524\n00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,260\nburn that ISO that we get from\nXenServer onto a USB key, Nate,\n\n525\n00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,280\nhow successful was that when you tried it?\n\n526\n00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,880\n>> Oh, which one?\n\n527\n00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,610\nOh, from the USB key?\n\n528\n00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n529\n00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,070\n>> Yeah, not much.\n\n530\n00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,010\nAlthough I didn't spend a whole heck of\na lot of time with everything else you\n\n531\n00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,780\nthrow in a USB key, you boot from it,\nit works, but every time,\n\n532\n00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:38,440\nyeah I tried to do it with the XenServer,\nit froze, it froze and nothing happened.\n\n533\n00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,280\n>> Yeah, they still kinda rely on\nthis most basic of hardware, so\n\n534\n00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,840\nthey do recommend that if you're going to\ndo this and install it on to a regular\n\n535\n00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,870\ncomputer here, or a server, that you do\ngo out and burn the ISO to a disk, and\n\n536\n00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,560\nwe went ahead and did that and\nwe put that into our machine as well.\n\n537\n00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,610\nNow when we start actually the install\nprocess here, remember that for\n\n538\n00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,870\nus the hardware, really just\nanything in the last three years,\n\n539\n00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,880\nthe thing that we're really\nconcerned about is whether or\n\n540\n00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,590\nnot we're actually going to be in an\nenvironment where we're gonna be running\n\n541\n00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,850\nmultiple XenServers as the host and\nwhere we're running a stand alone.\n\n542\n00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,480\nWe're just going to do\na single stand alone,\n\n543\n00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,730\nand that's when the minimum\nhardware requirements do matter\n\n544\n00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,860\nbecause we want to run the idea of\nWindows server machines to do this.\n\n545\n00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,520\nOkay.\n\n546\n00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,230\nWe want to make sure that what we have\naccess to, of course, are our Windows\n\n547\n00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,010\nserver ISOs that we need, and\nI may actually have to do that, and then\n\n548\n00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,600\nwe also want to make sure of course that\nwe can install those operating systems.\n\n549\n00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,720\nSo we gotta make sure that\nthe virtualization assist is turned on.\n\n550\n00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,510\nWe need hard drive space,\nplenty of hard drive space, and\n\n551\n00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,580\nwe need as much RAM as we can have so\n\n552\n00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,430\nthat each individual machine can actually\ntake up the RAM that they will need.\n\n553\n00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,020\nSo even though minimally, all we need\nis really what would run on Linux,\n\n554\n00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,610\nthe very problems is that we're gonna be\nrunning virtual machines off this device,\n\n555\n00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,240\nwe need as much hard drive space, we need\nas much RAM as possible, and of course,\n\n556\n00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440\nthe better the processor,\n\n557\n00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,060\nthe more number of processors,\nthe better it's gonna be as well.\n\n558\n00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,210\nSo what have we done?\n\n559\n00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,770\nWe went ahead and\ntried to get our machine set up here so\n\n560\n00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,600\nthat we can show you what we need to.\n\n561\n00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,190\nSo the install process\nthat we wanted to do,\n\n562\n00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,610\nwas we wanted to verify since\nwe're gonna be using or\n\n563\n00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,240\ninstalling Windows Server 2012 and\nmaybe a Windows 8 virtual machine here,\n\n564\n00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,310\nis that we do have a machine that will\nsupport the hardware virtualization.\n\n565\n00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,610\nRight, Nate?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n566\n00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,170\nYep.\nSo\n\n567\n00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,590\nwe've got this machine over\nhere on the ground and\n\n568\n00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,300\nwe've got a little monitor set up here.\n\n569\n00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,050\nSo we can't leverage our\nscreen sharing software, so\n\n570\n00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,760\nwe have to use this overhead cam to shoot\nit which doesn't look too bad this time.\n\n571\n00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,132\nAll right, so\nwe mentioned that AMD-V the Intel-VT,\n\n572\n00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,870\nvirtualization that we can get into\nthe BIOS and so we'll go ahead and\n\n573\n00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,740\nshow that on this particular machine.\n\n574\n00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,090\nThis is a Dell 960.\n\n575\n00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,590\nNow different bosses,\nthey'll be in different places.\n\n576\n00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,515\nThey'll look different, so\n\n577\n00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:59,450\nthis one is just merely an example\nof this particular model.\n\n578\n00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,216\nBut then scrolling on down here,\ninto virtualization, Support.\n\n579\n00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,656\nAll right so we have this right here,\n\n580\n00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:11,290\nthe Intel Virtualization Technology,\nthe Intel VT.\n\n581\n00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,350\nIt is on and enabled.\n\n582\n00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,655\nAnd then we have this other stuff here.\n\n583\n00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:20,510\nSo that is enabled and our little\ntrusted execution, it turned off, but\n\n584\n00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,640\nI think we'll be fine.\n\n585\n00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,150\n>> Yeah, so\nremember what this is actually doing.\n\n586\n00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,520\nIt's allowing, essentially, the hypervisor\nto be able to plug directly in here and\n\n587\n00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,020\nsee this, and report the actual\ntrue hardware that we have.\n\n588\n00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,740\nSo in the early days\nof the virtualization,\n\n589\n00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,300\nwe could actually turn that off.\n\n590\n00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,960\nAnd what would end up happening\non a type two hypervisor,\n\n591\n00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,490\nis that it would emulate\nwhatever hardware it chose.\n\n592\n00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,917\nSo like,\nthe very first one that I ever did, Nate,\n\n593\n00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,671\nwas actually one called Virtual PC.\n\n594\n00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,064\nIt wasn't even the 2007.\n\n595\n00:32:50,064 --> 00:32:52,990\nIt was whatever number\nit was at that point.\n\n596\n00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,490\nSo when you install the operating system\nin that, in the level two hypervisor here,\n\n597\n00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,290\nit would report like an 800MHz processor,\nand\n\n598\n00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:07,450\nsome generic PRO 10 or\nPRO 100 nic is what it would report.\n\n599\n00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,590\nAnd then whatever mountain\nof RAM we actually had.\n\n600\n00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,170\nSo, it would emulate somebody's hardware,\nbut not this hardware.\n\n601\n00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,410\nThis is actually what tells it,\n\n602\n00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,200\nhey, here's the processor that's\non this particular computer.\n\n603\n00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,740\nHere's the actual RAM that we have.\n\n604\n00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,690\nHere's everything that actually\nis this particular machine.\n\n605\n00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:29,310\nSo that way, the virtualization again,\nwhen we do install the operating system,\n\n606\n00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,130\nit really does actually think that\nit's really on the actual hardware.\n\n607\n00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,030\nSo, that's why it's important here,\nand the Windows newer servers and\n\n608\n00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,000\nnewer operating systems\nreally do need this support.\n\n609\n00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,270\nSo the good thing is,\nwe've got it enabled here.\n\n610\n00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,410\nLinux really doesn't care.\n\n611\n00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,824\nSo, whether we have it enabled or\nnot, it's not gonna really matter.\n\n612\n00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:46,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As what we have.\n\n613\n00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,844\nNow, don't get me wrong, some of them\nprobably do care but, at least for\n\n614\n00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,978\nour sake,\nthey really don't matter at this point.\n\n615\n00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:56,262\n>> All right so\nnow looking at that, what's next?\n\n616\n00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:58,628\nAre we ready to install this guy?\n\n617\n00:33:58,628 --> 00:33:59,510\n>> Just about, right?\n\n618\n00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,410\nSo, the only thing that we need, right,\nis that we need to make sure that we have\n\n619\n00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:08,420\nthat CD burned, or\nthe XenServer disk burned to a CD, and\n\n620\n00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,310\nall we have to do is actually pop it in\nto the CD and reboot the computer, okay?\n\n621\n00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,280\nSo, the good thing is we've already got\nin there, all we gotta do now Nate,\n\n622\n00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,600\nis, let's reboot this thing and\nsee the next step in the process here.\n\n623\n00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,768\nSee if it shows up in German.\n\n624\n00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then.\n\n625\n00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,170\nHere we go.\nI'm\n\n626\n00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,510\npicking on Nate cuz one of the things that\nwe did is something that actually ended up\n\n627\n00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,700\nshowing up in German on our screen and\nwe're like, how did it do that?\n\n628\n00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,430\nWe had no clue.\n\n629\n00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,600\n>> All right, so\nwe get up into our little boot menu here.\n\n630\n00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:42,594\nSo we'll choose to boot off of that\nCD ROM with our XenServer CD in there.\n\n631\n00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:45,200\nAnd from there, there we go.\n\n632\n00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,210\nIt is starting to load all\nits neat little stuff up.\n\n633\n00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,580\n>> Yep.\nIt's essentially loading in the idea of\n\n634\n00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,810\nthe Linux ISO right on here.\n\n635\n00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,330\nAnd now, notice it gives you\na nice little welcome menu.\n\n636\n00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,700\nAnd you see it's actually\nbeginning the loading process and\n\n637\n00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,920\nit's installing the basics\nof Citrix XenServer.\n\n638\n00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,455\nOkay.\n\n639\n00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:03,890\nAnd we start doing this.\n\n640\n00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,930\nAnd there it is, writing everything onto\nthe drive that it needs to take a look\n\n641\n00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,400\nfinding all of the different\nsupport in terms of hardware.\n\n642\n00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,200\nSo Nate do you remember what was\nthe first virtualization technology that\n\n643\n00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,710\nyou were using?\n\n644\n00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,110\n>> Yeah, you know there's just so\nmany, my heart lies with Hyper-V.\n\n645\n00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,660\n>> Hyper-V.\n\n646\n00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,000\n>> Yeah, so I'll continue that story,\nhere in a minute, but we are up here now.\n\n647\n00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,180\n>> Oh there we go, nice.\n\n648\n00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,654\n>> All right, so\nhere on our keymap, all right so\n\n649\n00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:34,970\nwell just keep with our\nstandard US qwerty keyboard.\n\n650\n00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,400\n>> Yep.\n\n651\n00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,694\n>> All right, Ryan,\nyou want to talk us through this?\n\n652\n00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:41,780\n>> Yeah, so the good thing is\nthe setup is actually not difficult.\n\n653\n00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,980\nBut you do wanna slow down\nthrough these menus here,\n\n654\n00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,880\nwhen you start doing this, okay?\n\n655\n00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,230\nAnd the reason why I'm telling\nyou is not because I'm\n\n656\n00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,180\nneeding you to read everything, but there\nare a couple of options in here we wanna\n\n657\n00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,420\nmake sure that you do get access to and\nthat you do know what's going on.\n\n658\n00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,660\nSo here it just tells us that at this\npoint, if we had a RAID array, and\n\n659\n00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,590\nit didn't show up on the install,\n\n660\n00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,480\nthis is the point where we\nactually load our drivers in.\n\n661\n00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,085\nSo you need your drivers maybe on\na USB key, or, even worse, right,\n\n662\n00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:16,020\nyou might actually have to burn them\nto a CD to gain access to them.\n\n663\n00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,255\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully not,\n\n664\n00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:18,857\nbut it is very possible here.\n\n665\n00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,725\nSo if your hard drive doesn't show\nup when you go through and say,\n\n666\n00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:26,240\nhey, what hard drive I wanna install\nthis onto, you may have to reboot again,\n\n667\n00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,835\ncome to this point here, and load\nthose drivers in, so do pay attention.\n\n668\n00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:34,840\n>> Yeah, and at this point here, so\nnot only those RAID controllers,\n\n669\n00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,000\nbut any nonstandard hardware,\nkinda a general term.\n\n670\n00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,600\nSo, chances are it'd just be some\nkind of a RAID controller or\n\n671\n00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,415\nsomething of that sort.\n\n672\n00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:49,890\nBut any kind of non-standard hardware\nthat isn't being detected that is\n\n673\n00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,420\ncritical to installing this is,\nhere we go, load the drivers for it.\n\n674\n00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,130\n>> Now, the other thing to be aware of,\nright, is the last sentence in that first\n\n675\n00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,855\nparagraph Nate,\nis the one to be aware of, right?\n\n676\n00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:03,514\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Installing XenServer will erase all\n\n677\n00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,602\nthe data on the disk selected for\nusage here.\n\n678\n00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:08,010\nSo in other words,\n\n679\n00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,280\ndon't grab Nate's machines that he's\ndoing all these different things on.\n\n680\n00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280\nHe may not appreciate\n\n681\n00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,780\nif you delete everything that\nhe's actually running there.\n\n682\n00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,540\nYou want to grab one that\nyou actually can say,\n\n683\n00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,520\nI don't mind if this\nparticular machine gets hosed.\n\n684\n00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,530\nThis is what we're really\ntalking about here.\n\n685\n00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,300\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n686\n00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,380\nIt's a big warning but you know, a lot\nof times if I were doing this, right,\n\n687\n00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,210\nI would say, maybe we should have\nhighlighted that one in red so\n\n688\n00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,980\nthat you actually understand.\n\n689\n00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,030\nCuz some people might just go,\nyou know what, I don't really care.\n\n690\n00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,640\nAnd just keep clicking through.\n\n691\n00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,270\nNate's not one of those, are you?\n\n692\n00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:44,972\nYou just click through?\n\n693\n00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,220\nDo you read every single message?\n\n694\n00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,360\n>> Generally a lot of times,\n\n695\n00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,482\nI probably would have been in\nthe install process at this point.\n\n696\n00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,488\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Instead of on this first screen.\n\n697\n00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a terrible habit.\n\n698\n00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,350\nBut I've put a lot of trust\nin default selections.\n\n699\n00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,920\nJust like, next, next, next,\nokay, okay, next, next.\n\n700\n00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,030\n>> And then oops.\n\n701\n00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,890\n>> Yeah, like, wait, why isn't this?\n\n702\n00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,770\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so let's go\nahead and press Ok at this point here.\n\n703\n00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,101\nNow of course, Nate,\n\n704\n00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:14,739\nyou would absolutely read every single-\n>> Next.\n\n705\n00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,680\n[LAUGH]\n>> One of these things here.\n\n706\n00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,310\nAnd now, this Is kinda the big\ndifference between what we saw\n\n707\n00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,410\nin terms of the hardware, right?\n\n708\n00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,910\nSo when we take a look at\nthe ID of the hard drives,\n\n709\n00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,710\nin Linux they actually reported\nas these SDA, SDB things here.\n\n710\n00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,680\nAnd Nate, looks like we actually have a\ncouple of hard drives that are essentially\n\n711\n00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920\nidentical for us.\n\n712\n00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,820\nSo it's saying, hey, which of these hard\ndrives do we want to install this on here?\n\n713\n00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,555\nIt says disk with insufficient\nspace is not shown, so\n\n714\n00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,960\nif you don't have enough hard drive space,\nit's not gonna allow us.\n\n715\n00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,680\nLet's just choose that first one.\n\n716\n00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,750\nIt looks identical at this point here.\n\n717\n00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,301\nNow it gives us an option, though,\n\n718\n00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,180\nin terms of where are we gonna\nstore the virtual machines.\n\n719\n00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,830\nOkay?\n\n720\n00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,710\nWell, a better performance benefit for us,\n\n721\n00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,320\nof course,\nwould be to put our virtuals on to what?\n\n722\n00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,330\nAnother disk.\n\n723\n00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,710\nThat way we can access one without\n\n724\n00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,200\nhaving to actually worry\nabout the XenServer itself.\n\n725\n00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800\nSo, yeah, we can select [b].\n\n726\n00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,550\nThat will work.\n\n727\n00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:10,560\nSo, what Nate's doing here is he's\nusing the arrow keys and the selection,\n\n728\n00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,060\nof course, is the space bar,\nis what he's doing.\n\n729\n00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,420\nSo, let's see, which disk,\njust select one or the other.\n\n730\n00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,190\nYeah there we go.\n\n731\n00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,280\n>> But we will have 149 GB just hanging\nit out if we don't use it for anything.\n\n732\n00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,620\n>> Oh dear, yeah,\nyou can install, okay, go ahead.\n\n733\n00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,772\nNate's having to-\n>> Okay, you made the call,\n\n734\n00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,040\nall right that works.\n\n735\n00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,860\n>> Now, if we were gonna\nbe using XenDesktop, again,\n\n736\n00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,260\nthat virtual desktop environment,\nthat would be one thing.\n\n737\n00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,640\nWe're not, so let's go ahead and\nclick Ok at this picker point.\n\n738\n00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,390\n>> All right, and so no thin provisioning.\n\n739\n00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,780\n>> I don't need any thin provisioning.\n\n740\n00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,795\nI'm thick enough.\n\n741\n00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:49,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n742\n00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,161\nNow, notice that some or all of the disks\nyou selected to install XenServer, okay,\n\n743\n00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:54,222\ncontain parts of an LVM illogical volume,\nokay, group here.\n\n744\n00:39:54,222 --> 00:40:01,606\nProceeding with the installation will\ncause these volume groups to be deleted.\n\n745\n00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,579\nYou sure you want to do this here?\n\n746\n00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,657\nNot sure if I like it.\n\n747\n00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:06,227\nAll right.\n\n748\n00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:10,918\nNow, its gonna ask where in the world\nis the actual XenServer CD that\n\n749\n00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:15,380\nwe're installing from, so\nthe local media is what we have.\n\n750\n00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,520\nBut notice we can actually do\nthis from a website, right?\n\n751\n00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,740\nJust like a regular Linux install\nto actually be able to do that.\n\n752\n00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,470\nOr we have it on network file sharing.\n\n753\n00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,558\nWe can do that as well.\n\n754\n00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:28,820\n>> So the rest, what would\nnecessarily be the benefit of ACDP\n\n755\n00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,530\nas opposed to our current CD?\n\n756\n00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,910\n>> The only benefit is if we\nhad a lot of server drive.\n\n757\n00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,790\nDon't have to bring a CD\nto every single one.\n\n758\n00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,130\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n759\n00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,500\nIf it's actually stored in one location,\nI can access it from across the network.\n\n760\n00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,280\nBe ready to go.\n\n761\n00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,730\n>> Could it be that our CD is out of date?\n\n762\n00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,060\nIf we go to ACDP or something like that.\n\n763\n00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,380\nWould it get the latest install stuff?\n\n764\n00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,130\n>> It may, but I don't really know for\nsure if this one actually works that way.\n\n765\n00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,990\nOr if you actually compile\nit in the same way.\n\n766\n00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,730\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n767\n00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,230\n>> Sweet.\nOkay.\n\n768\n00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,180\nLocal media, are we go.\n\n769\n00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,980\nSearching for repository.\n\n770\n00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n771\n00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,860\nSo now is waiting and\nasking, hey, are we sure?\n\n772\n00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,640\nIn other words, does it find the actual\nCD where the XenServer install is?\n\n773\n00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,950\nIn terms of supplemental pacts,\nwe're not upgrading anything, so\n\n774\n00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,340\nat this point we're gonna select no.\n\n775\n00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,270\nNow, this is something that\nin a testing environment,\n\n776\n00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:32,630\nskipping verification is a thing\nthat we would always do.\n\n777\n00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,170\nSeriously, always in terms of testing\nbecause it's gonna take a long time.\n\n778\n00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,860\nIf I were setting this up for\na production environment.\n\n779\n00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,780\nIn other words, this is a server that I'm\ngonna be using for a year or two years,\n\n780\n00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,900\nthree years, whatever it's gonna be, and\n\n781\n00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,140\nthis is gonna be part of my\nvirtualization infrastructure.\n\n782\n00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,700\nI want to make sure that somewhere\nalong the line, I didn't miss anything.\n\n783\n00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,980\nSo, notice it gives us the idea to verify.\n\n784\n00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,210\nAnd again, it's going to ask you to\nrun a hash value and check it, and\n\n785\n00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,960\ndo all of that stuff for us.\n\n786\n00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,690\nAnd normally, in a production environment,\nyou absolutely wanna do this.\n\n787\n00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,130\nBut, I do have to warn you,\n\n788\n00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,430\nif may selects the wrong one,\nit's gonna take a bit of time.\n\n789\n00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,310\nIt may take hours.\n\n790\n00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,550\n>> Oh yeah?\nJust to check all that stuff?\n\n791\n00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,530\n>> To just check it.\n\n792\n00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,820\nIt may take hours.\n\n793\n00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,420\nIt does normally.\n\n794\n00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,510\nIt may take up to an hour.\n\n795\n00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,800\nI've seen it actually\ntake up to an hour here.\n\n796\n00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,670\nBut for us we're gonna skip the time here,\nin step.\n\n797\n00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,990\nVery important at this point of course,\nto specify a password.\n\n798\n00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,498\nSo just put in our lab password Nate.\n\n799\n00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,890\nOkay, all right, so notice it tells\nus in the parentheses at right.\n\n800\n00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,930\nThis is the password used when\nconnecting to the XenServer host.\n\n801\n00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,050\nWhich is this machine that we're\ninstalling it on from XenCenter.\n\n802\n00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,350\nNow this is the first time we've\nmentioned XenCenter here but\n\n803\n00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:57,370\nwhen we actually use like, HyperV when we\ndid that particular installation here.\n\n804\n00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:02,770\nWe were able to go directly to that server\nthat we had, log into the Windows machine,\n\n805\n00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,140\ngain access to the HyperV manager,\nthat was it.\n\n806\n00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,000\nBut when we finish with this,\nwe're not gonna be able to gain access.\n\n807\n00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,730\nWe can't actually do all the things\nI want to on here directly.\n\n808\n00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,640\nThe management console for\nus is not Hyper-V Manager.\n\n809\n00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,390\nThe management console for\nthe XenServer is what we call XenCenter,.\n\n810\n00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,240\nAnd you'll see that we're gonna install\nthat onto another machine is what we're\n\n811\n00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,500\ngonna do Okay?\n\n812\n00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,260\nSo at this point here, now that we have\neverything confirmed we're gonna do this.\n\n813\n00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,980\nNow, in terms of networking, if you\nknow of a static IP address that this\n\n814\n00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,690\nis gonna be set up, perfectly fine that\nwe go ahead and type all this stuff in.\n\n815\n00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:41,300\nBut if we don't know, using the automatic\nconfiguration will work for us.\n\n816\n00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,326\nLet's just go ahead and\ndo that because we can change it later.\n\n817\n00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:50,060\n>> Ryan, through this connection machine\nI did not connect any network to it.\n\n818\n00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:57,560\nSo why don't we send it statically and\nthen we'll connect it later, on the break.\n\n819\n00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,110\nI'll find a cord and do it.\n\n820\n00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,720\n>> All right.\n\n821\n00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,240\n>> All right.\nSo\n\n822\n00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,230\nI am pretty sure I know what\nnetwork we're gonna listen to.\n\n823\n00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,730\n>> Yep.\n\n824\n00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,670\n>> And so we're gonna call this 206.\n\n825\n00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,500\nI'm pretty sure that one is not in use.\n\n826\n00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,930\n>> If not, we could probably do\nthat 29 that is was or something.\n\n827\n00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,400\nOr whatever that's, I don't even know\nif that's actually the right one.\n\n828\n00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,640\n>> Should we give it the gateway?\n\n829\n00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,750\nLet's go ahead and give it a gateway.\n\n830\n00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,870\n>> Alright.\n\n831\n00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,570\nPretty good.\n\n832\n00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,490\n>> Alright, go ahead and click okay.\n\n833\n00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,320\nAnd now, you do want to rename this thing.\n\n834\n00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,830\nI guarantee you, there's not an easy way\nto rename this except for right here.\n\n835\n00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:40,130\nYou can go into XenCenter all you want and\ntry and rename it is not gonna like it.\n\n836\n00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,660\nSo right here, this is what you wanna do.\n\n837\n00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,285\nSo Walt, you wanna just call it Xenserver?\n\n838\n00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:44,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That'll work?\n\n839\n00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,300\n>> Sure.\n>> Okay.\n\n840\n00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,120\nAnd go ahead and\nset in our DNS server address as well.\n\n841\n00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,630\n>> Good enough.\n\n842\n00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,470\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n843\n00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,010\n>> Does that work?\n\n844\n00:44:54,010 --> 00:45:02,020\nAll right, of course, the geographic\narea for us is going to be America.\n\n845\n00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,140\nAnd you could scroll all the way down.\n\n846\n00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,900\nYou can type in an n to\nget to New York because\n\n847\n00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,040\nthat's where we are in\nthe Eastern Time Zone.\n\n848\n00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,560\nNow, the setting up of the time, right,\nwe want everything to be synchronized and\n\n849\n00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,400\ndo everything that we want to do here.\n\n850\n00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,750\nAnd if we are actually going\nbe using this across machines,\n\n851\n00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,450\nusing the network time\nserver as a way to go.\n\n852\n00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,720\nOr we can manually enter it then.\n\n853\n00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,300\nLet's just go ahead and\ndo the NTP at this point.\n\n854\n00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,620\nIt's not going to hurt us any.\n\n855\n00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,211\nNow on this one go ahead and\n\n856\n00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,470\ntype in 0.pool.mtp.org.\n\n857\n00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,690\nThere are different internet\ntime server that are out there.\n\n858\n00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,390\nIf this is going to be a stand\nalone host machine, which it is,\n\n859\n00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,600\nwe're not going to worry about\njoining it to a domain or anything.\n\n860\n00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,230\nWe want to be able to synchronize\nacross multiple XenServers here.\n\n861\n00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,570\nWe're gonna point them all to the same\nNTP servers, is what we're gonna do.\n\n862\n00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,110\nAnd this is one that's\nout on the internet.\n\n863\n00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:54,960\nAll right.\n\n864\n00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,840\nNow everything is actually collected and\nready to go at this point here.\n\n865\n00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,170\nGo ahead and it says, notice that the\nsecond paragraph, please confirm you wish\n\n866\n00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:10,800\nto proceed all data on both disks that\nwe've chosen are gonna be destroyed here.\n\n867\n00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,580\nOkay.\n\n868\n00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,084\n>> So remember if you thought you\nwere only installing this on 1 disc,\n\n869\n00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:15,950\nyou're wrong.\n\n870\n00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,000\nSo here it says it's gonna do it all.\n\n871\n00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,630\nLet's go ahead and\nlet it install at this point here.\n\n872\n00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,290\nIs what we're gonna do.\n\n873\n00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,030\nSo here is the installing process here.\n\n874\n00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,070\nIt's really not a big install.\n\n875\n00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,290\nIt doesn't take really\na lot of time at all.\n\n876\n00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,154\nYou already notice it's\nrunning at about 55%, 56%.\n\n877\n00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:35,500\nJust 55%,\nI thought it had changed here to 56%.\n\n878\n00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,630\n>> Just preparing.\n>> It's preparing for\n\n879\n00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,130\nthe installation here, so it's actually\nloading everything up into RAM.\n\n880\n00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,600\nAnd in a moment once it does it, notice it\njumped up there to 66% and it's now having\n\n881\n00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,450\nto go through and work and do all\nthe other things it's needing to do.\n\n882\n00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,480\n>> And it's also making some\nstrange beeping noises.\n\n883\n00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,730\n>> Yeah,\nit's making some strange beeping noise.\n\n884\n00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,360\n>> Back here maybe.\nAs part of the installation.\n\n885\n00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,590\n>> It shouldn't be, but\nwe'll see what happens here as well.\n\n886\n00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,070\nAll right.\n\n887\n00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:04,210\nSo here it goes, installing from whatever\nthe base is on the operating system, okay?\n\n888\n00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,010\nSo again,\nit's expanding everything out and\n\n889\n00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,490\nactually putting it on to\nthe hard drive itself.\n\n890\n00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,030\nAnd this is laying down\nthat hyper visor for us and\n\n891\n00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,280\na barely minimum management\nconsole when we get ready.\n\n892\n00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,460\nAnd verify that everything is actually\nworking for us as well, okay.\n\n893\n00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,160\nSo this process is probably just\ngonna take another couple of minutes\n\n894\n00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,180\nfor us here.\n\n895\n00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,790\nSo, it's actually not a bad time for\na break so\n\n896\n00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,930\nwe can get that network cable plugged in.\n\n897\n00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,160\n>> Oh yeah.\nThat's right.\n\n898\n00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,410\n>> And then we'll be ready to go.\n\n899\n00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,100\n>> Yeah, kind of zinging along,\nbut Ryan is right.\n\n900\n00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,220\nWe do have a few minutes left on break but\n\n901\n00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,480\nthis is a good stopping point so\nwe'll go ahead and take a break here.\n\n902\n00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,870\nI'll rustle up a network cable and\nget this guy plugged in.\n\n903\n00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,080\nHopefully it's in the correct\nnetwork that we gave it to.\n\n904\n00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,645\n>> Yeah, we'll see.\n\n905\n00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:49,227\n[LAUGH]\n>> That would make managing it a little\n\n906\n00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:50,730\nbit more difficult.\n\n907\n00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,711\nSo we'll get to that\nstuff after the break.\n\n908\n00:47:52,711 --> 00:48:00,177\n[SOUND]\n[SOUND]\n\n909\n00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,120\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n910\n00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,280\nAll right, so our install, it did finish.\n\n911\n00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,780\n>> All right.\n\n912\n00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,790\n>> And so it was stuck at, not stuck, but\nit paused at that confirmation screen.\n\n913\n00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,330\nWell, our screen went dark.\n\n914\n00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,040\nIt went to sleep and so I walked over, and\n\n915\n00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,015\nI pressed the spacebar to wake it up and\nspacebar is, I guess, the new Enter.\n\n916\n00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:23,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so it said okay, the PC rebooted.\n\n917\n00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,540\nI boot up into XenServer and\non the little splash screen, and\n\n918\n00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,280\nby the time we got\nthe network plugged in and\n\n919\n00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,320\ngot able to ping that IP address,\nit finished loading up.\n\n920\n00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,030\nAnd now, it dumped us in to XenServer.\n\n921\n00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:44,770\nWhich isn't quite the big graphic,\nawesome that we have here.\n\n922\n00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,280\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n923\n00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,130\nNow, for us right, we're not really\ndoing any real management from this.\n\n924\n00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,780\nBut we have to verify that\nthe basic configuration\n\n925\n00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,680\nis what we really need here, right?\n\n926\n00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,910\nSo, right here when it first\nlaunches up after the install,\n\n927\n00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,610\nthis is all you really get,\nthe configuration.\n\n928\n00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,150\nAnd, notice that you have a whole list of\nsome of the different things you can have.\n\n929\n00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,290\nWhat we're doing is we're verifying\nthat these things are working for us.\n\n930\n00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:12,150\nBecause we do manage this from across\nthe network here, we have to verify that\n\n931\n00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,220\nthat IP address is actually working,\nand so Nate did that for us.\n\n932\n00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,980\nHe pinged it from a machine\non the same network, and\n\n933\n00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,105\nso we're gonna be using this particular\nIP address that we see right here,\n\n934\n00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:27,000\n10.1.230.206, to allow us\nto be able to manage this.\n\n935\n00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,864\nSo normally to manage it, though, one of\nthe unusual requirements, or stringent\n\n936\n00:49:32,864 --> 00:49:38,330\nrequirements I guess, is that you do\nneed a Windows computer to manage this.\n\n937\n00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,650\nSo it can't be managed inside of a Linux\ncomputer, of all the things here.\n\n938\n00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,690\nBecause a XenServer really\nonly runs inside of Windows.\n\n939\n00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,500\nSo for us here that's one of\nthe limitations that we have.\n\n940\n00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,160\nIt does require a Windows computer.\n\n941\n00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,130\nSo anything Windows XP or\nabove should work.\n\n942\n00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,560\n>> So Ronnie, let me ask you this.\n\n943\n00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,980\nSo, Could you bring up a virtual Windows\ncomputer on your Linux machine, or your\n\n944\n00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:06,470\nMac OSX, and then run XenCenter inside\nof a virtual Windows PC on your MacBook?\n\n945\n00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,870\n>> Yes, you can.\n\n946\n00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,750\nIt can work.\n\n947\n00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,510\n>> Nice, the power of virtualization.\n\n948\n00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,970\n>> There we go, yep.\n\n949\n00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:17,328\nGo in and let's select the second option\nthere on the network interface as well.\n\n950\n00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:20,720\nAnd notice if we wanted to reconfigure\nthis thing, we could also do it here too.\n\n951\n00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,780\nIt says press Enter to configure\nthe management of the network connection,\n\n952\n00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,030\nhost name, network time and settings.\n\n953\n00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:29,531\nAt this point, if everything is good for\nus we really don't have to do that,\n\n954\n00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:32,240\nbut notice it's giving\nus another verification.\n\n955\n00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,730\nThis time we can also see, of course,\n\n956\n00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,270\nthe addition of the MAC address here for\nus here.\n\n957\n00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,300\n\"And the next is another\none that we have too, okay?\n\n958\n00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,710\nSo the authentication says you\nare currently not logged in.\n\n959\n00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,206\nOnly logged in users can reconfigure and\ncontrol this server.\n\n960\n00:50:46,206 --> 00:50:48,972\nPress <Enter> to change\nthe log in password and\n\n961\n00:50:48,972 --> 00:50:50,870\nthe auto login password as well.\n\n962\n00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,313\nNow, this one we really wanna go ahead and\npress Enter in, so\n\n963\n00:50:54,313 --> 00:50:56,780\nthat we can get access to it as well.\n\n964\n00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,510\nSo, go ahead and do that.\n\n965\n00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,100\nWe wanna leave root as the username.\n\n966\n00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,040\nYou don't have to, everybody changes root.\n\n967\n00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,930\nBut, let's go ahead and just leave it\nhere, and we're just gonna use our login.\n\n968\n00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,950\nIf we ever have to come back in and\nreconfigure this,\n\n969\n00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,140\nif we don't set it up,\nwe can't reconfigure it.\n\n970\n00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,760\nSo we wanna make sure we go ahead and\ndo that, as well.\n\n971\n00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,640\nAnd enable that.\n\n972\n00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,720\nAnd notice down in\nthe lower left hand corner,\n\n973\n00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,640\nit tells us how we get back\nout to the outer menu.\n\n974\n00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,950\nAnd then, here's where you think,\nhey look.\n\n975\n00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,620\nHere it is, the reason why we're running\n\n976\n00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,840\nthe IBM XenServer of course\nis the virtual machines here.\n\n977\n00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,800\nPress <Enter> to view\nthe Virtual Machines menu.\n\n978\n00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,530\nThis menu can start, stop and\n\n979\n00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,060\nmigrate existing Virtual Machines on\nthis host, display its performance.\n\n980\n00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,610\nNotice the word that's missing here, Nate.\n\n981\n00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,815\n>> The word create-\n>> Create.\n\n982\n00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:41,315\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or build.\n\n983\n00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:42,020\n>> That's it.\n\n984\n00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,020\n>> Make new.\n>> Yeah.\n\n985\n00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,440\nYou can start one, but\nif you go to this list.\n\n986\n00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,620\nPress Enter, and\nthere is no VMs running on this host.\n\n987\n00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,580\nPress Enter again, let's see.\n\n988\n00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,300\nNo virtual machines present.\n\n989\n00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,160\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n990\n00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,610\nWell how the heck do you create one?\n\n991\n00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,920\nYou can start one that says, right?\n\n992\n00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,850\nYou can stop one.\n\n993\n00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,790\nYou can import one.\n\n994\n00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,450\nYou can do all this other stuff.\n\n995\n00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,250\nYou don't have any.\n\n996\n00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,120\nYou can't create one here, it has to\nbe done in the XenCenter as well, okay.\n\n997\n00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,430\nSo you can get some host information and\n\n998\n00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,160\nif you actually had VM's, you could see\na list of them right there as well.\n\n999\n00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,020\nBut you really can't do anything,\n\n1000\n00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,710\nin terms of creation of these things,\nright here on the host itself.\n\n1001\n00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,610\nDisk and Storage Repositories.\n\n1002\n00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:25,100\nSo here we can go and set up a few things,\nbut we're not gonna do it here,\n\n1003\n00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,120\nwe're gonna do it in\nthe XenCenter instead.\n\n1004\n00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,930\nSo the idea of the disk and\nstorage repositories, to create and\n\n1005\n00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,520\nattach these repositories here, and we're\nusing the local hard drive to store VMs.\n\n1006\n00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,430\nWe could set it up right here.\n\n1007\n00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,490\nOr for us, when we actually go and\nget the access to the ISA folders,\n\n1008\n00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,880\nwe can do this as well.\n\n1009\n00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,310\nBut we're going to do\nthis in the XenCenter, so\n\n1010\n00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,160\nwe're not gonna worry about it.\n\n1011\n00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,570\nResource Pool Configuration.\n\n1012\n00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,740\nThis is one of the easiest\nthings that we can do.\n\n1013\n00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,490\nIf I am actually running multiple\nXenServers, okay, in different locations,\n\n1014\n00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:58,030\nand I want to be able to actually\nuse them as a single resource,\n\n1015\n00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,450\nI can create what's\ncalled a resource pool.\n\n1016\n00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,750\nSo I may have a XenCenter set up here.\n\n1017\n00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,520\nI may have one set up across town.\n\n1018\n00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,850\nI may have another XenServer, excuse me,\nhost set up somewhere else here.\n\n1019\n00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:13,700\nBut what I can do is manage them all\nas one, and since you do the idea of\n\n1020\n00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,590\nclustering, is what we're really talking\nabout, it's relatively easy to do this.\n\n1021\n00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,605\nOnce we actually have multiple\nXenServers set up here.\n\n1022\n00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:22,290\nAnd we configure them,\nthat should be in the same pool.\n\n1023\n00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,750\nSo right here's one of\nthe ways that we can do that,\n\n1024\n00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,880\nas well if we actually had it, okay?\n\n1025\n00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,160\nSo we'll see about that\na little bit later.\n\n1026\n00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,110\nOf course our regular host and\nBIOS information as well.\n\n1027\n00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,560\nAnd then timezone, keyboard,\nstuff that you should know.\n\n1028\n00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,060\nRemote Service Configuration.\n\n1029\n00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:44,370\nNotice that you can use SSH to access\nin syslog stuff, all this stuff,\n\n1030\n00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,960\nthe same things that we just normally do\nto manage a regular server is also there.\n\n1031\n00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,210\nBackup and restore, and updates,\nof course, are also important.\n\n1032\n00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,750\nNow, this is something that we're gonna\ntalk about a little bit more in depth\n\n1033\n00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,254\nlater on.\n\n1034\n00:53:54,254 --> 00:53:58,470\nBecause XenServer is a free tool,\n\n1035\n00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,620\nyou can update it, because it's free,\nyou have to update it manually.\n\n1036\n00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,990\nIf you buy the support,\n\n1037\n00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:08,040\nthat actually gives you the ability\nto do the automatic updates.\n\n1038\n00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,550\nAnd to of course have the support\nif you don't have it.\n\n1039\n00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,120\nBut you have to do it manually.\n\n1040\n00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,370\nAnd the other thing, Nate, that we\nactually have to do on the free side,\n\n1041\n00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,610\nis there's nothing in\nthe XenCenter itself that says,\n\n1042\n00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,090\nhey, let's just click on this and\ndownload the updates and install it.\n\n1043\n00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,925\nYou have to use the command prompt,\nand it's not just DOS, right.\n\n1044\n00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:31,740\nIt's actually XenCenter, or XenServer's\nspecial command prompt that they call xe,\n\n1045\n00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,905\nthe Xen executive command or\nwhatever they want to call it.\n\n1046\n00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:39,260\nSo a little bit special syntax there,\nto get that up and working as well.\n\n1047\n00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,120\nTechnical Support, of course,\nis exactly like it sounds if we have it,\n\n1048\n00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,180\nwe're not buying anything so\nwe don't have that.\n\n1049\n00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,090\nWe of course can reboot it,\n\n1050\n00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,820\nshut down, and then if you wanted\nto run that Xen command line and\n\n1051\n00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,821\nactually manage everything through the\ncommand line and not the XenCenter, okay?\n\n1052\n00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,585\nOnly people as hardcore as Nate Copeland.\n\n1053\n00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,980\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> Would ever do anything like this.\n\n1054\n00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,920\n>> So you're saying that we\ncan't run power show commands?\n\n1055\n00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,310\n>> No power show.\n\n1056\n00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,280\n>> Well then I yeah I got nothing.\n\n1057\n00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,290\n>> Yeah, this is XenServer xe commands,\nis all this one actually is doing.\n\n1058\n00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,410\n>> Right.\n>> So you can do it,\n\n1059\n00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,670\nbut there's not a lot of us\nthat will actually do that.\n\n1060\n00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,920\nIf you were scripting this out for\nhundreds of machines you might do this.\n\n1061\n00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,400\nBut for most of us we are gonna use the\nXenCenter, is what we're going to do here.\n\n1062\n00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,000\nSo the basic install is really, again,\n\n1063\n00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,290\njust like installing a regular application\nor an operating system on the computer.\n\n1064\n00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,100\nIt really took about six minutes,\n\n1065\n00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,260\nmaybe not even that long to\nget everything up and running.\n\n1066\n00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,150\nWe took a little bit more time\ncuz we're explaining it to you.\n\n1067\n00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:41,350\nWe need that IP address as pretty\nmuch the key that we had here.\n\n1068\n00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,190\nSo, that was 230.206.\n\n1069\n00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,690\n>> Correct.\n>> Is the one that we had.\n\n1070\n00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,170\nSo, that really is kinda the next\npiece of the puzzle for us.\n\n1071\n00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,825\nOnce this machine is up and operating,\n\n1072\n00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:53,009\nWhat we would normally do on\na regular server is, believe it or\n\n1073\n00:55:53,009 --> 00:55:57,600\nnot, if this is all set up,\nI don't have to touch it again.\n\n1074\n00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,690\nI can just turn off the monitor, and\nleave this thing as is sitting there.\n\n1075\n00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,100\nOkay?\nThat's all that it actually takes.\n\n1076\n00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,960\nIn terms of the management though,\n\n1077\n00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,750\nthe management is always done on\nanother machine from the network here.\n\n1078\n00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,210\nOver on my particular computer here, if I,\n\n1079\n00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,670\nI hope I have my screen\nsharing software up.\n\n1080\n00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,790\nYep.\n\n1081\n00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:25,760\nSo over on my computer, the easiest way\nto gain access to that screen sharing.\n\n1082\n00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,912\nOr not screen sharing.\n\n1083\n00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:32,580\nThe XenCenter okay, is to connect to the\nXenServer and install that on my machine.\n\n1084\n00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,690\nSo you might be wondering,\nwell how the heck do I get that.\n\n1085\n00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,000\nWell, it's relatively easy again.\n\n1086\n00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,480\nIf you know how to use a browser,\nwell this is how easy it actually is.\n\n1087\n00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,680\nI can go to this tab right here.\n\n1088\n00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,662\nType in the IP Address,\nwhich was 10.1.230.206,\n\n1089\n00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:55,320\nright here, and\n\n1090\n00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,670\nnotice it connects me to a very simple web\npage here, that is connecting that server.\n\n1091\n00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,290\nSo it's already running a basic\nweb server in the background, and\n\n1092\n00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,170\nit gives me the option\nof what I want to do.\n\n1093\n00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:09,950\nYou want to copy this in server CD image,\nand\n\n1094\n00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:15,210\nthen I can manually install on whatever\nmachines I want to from across network, or\n\n1095\n00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,170\nyou wanna just run the installer.\n\n1096\n00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,250\nWhich one, Nate, are we gonna do today?\n\n1097\n00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,740\n>> Well, I think that because we won't be\ninstalling this on any other machines,\n\n1098\n00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,530\nlets just run that installer.\n\n1099\n00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,710\n>> All right, so\nI'm gonna choose the XenCenter installer,\n\n1100\n00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,320\nI am running Windows 8.1 so\nwe'll see if she has any problems here.\n\n1101\n00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,980\nAnd then now let's see\nif I can just run it.\n\n1102\n00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,280\nThere it goes.\n\n1103\n00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,240\nIt gives me the actual\nXenCenter Setup here.\n\n1104\n00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,930\nSetup will actually install\nit on the computer, and\n\n1105\n00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,080\nif I can, I love my track pad on my XPS.\n\n1106\n00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,190\n>> Oh, it's nice.\n\n1107\n00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,910\n>> It's by far one of the most incredible\n>> Pieces of\n\n1108\n00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,750\ntotal trash that we can\n>> What I like most about it is how it\n\n1109\n00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,570\npreemptively decides what it\nis you're gonna click on.\n\n1110\n00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,740\nSo before you even know you're gonna\nclick and pull up your charms bar\n\n1111\n00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,950\n>> Yeah, it does it for you.\n\n1112\n00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:05,960\n>> That's right.\n\n1113\n00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,780\nIt is incredible.\n\n1114\n00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,450\n>> It is.\nIt's very incredible that it actually\n\n1115\n00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,670\nchooses what I don't really want to do.\n\n1116\n00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,460\nYeah, so there we go.\n\n1117\n00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,040\n>> We just haven't realized\nthat's what you needed.\n\n1118\n00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,510\n>> I know.\nIt's one of those features.\n\n1119\n00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,160\nYou just learn to live\nwith it after a while.\n\n1120\n00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,348\n>> So there we go.\n\n1121\n00:58:18,348 --> 00:58:23,660\nSo Citrix XenCenter set up the default\ninstall path is pretty much fine for me.\n\n1122\n00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,530\nSo I could choose all users of all time.\n\n1123\n00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:28,190\nI'm just gonna choose me\ncuz I'm selfish that way.\n\n1124\n00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,520\nClick install and let it install there.\n\n1125\n00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,310\nSo it's now installing the actual\nXenCenter management console for\n\n1126\n00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,890\nus to be able to set this up, okay?\n\n1127\n00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,650\nNow, the nice thing is,\n\n1128\n00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:43,730\nNate, I've had experience with\nXenCenter as well as with Hyper-V.\n\n1129\n00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:48,800\nAnd we've talked about this before on,\nyou know, even outside the show here.\n\n1130\n00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,860\nBy setting this thing up, I actually have\npreferred the idea of using XenCenter.\n\n1131\n00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,270\nA little bit easier.\n\n1132\n00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,750\nAnd I'm gonna try and convince you of\nthat, Nate, is what I'm gonna try to do.\n\n1133\n00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,280\n>> Right.\n\n1134\n00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,820\n>> Nate is a die-hard Hyper-V guy.\n\n1135\n00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,920\nYou know and\n>> And so\n\n1136\n00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,750\n>> Yeah I am, and\n\n1137\n00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:10,940\nhow well is in the start of sharing\nthe as it was installing therefore but.\n\n1138\n00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:15,420\nYeah so my entry into\nvirtualization was with Hyper-V and\n\n1139\n00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,730\ncause that's what was on all the exams.\n\n1140\n00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:28,300\nSo if you're going to take\nthe well you got to know Hyper-V.\n\n1141\n00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,641\nYou take 410 or 411 [CROSSTALK] 7410 7411,\nit's all Hyper-V.\n\n1142\n00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:37,100\nWell, If that's what's gonna be on\nthe exam, then heaven sakes, I better know\n\n1143\n00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:42,580\nit inside and out, and once you know a\ntool, you just kinda stick with that tool.\n\n1144\n00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,220\nRonnie, he showed XenServer number four,\nlike, I don't know.\n\n1145\n00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,644\nManager, you know where everything is.\n\n1146\n00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:51,515\nIt just works.\n\n1147\n00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:52,800\n>> It just works.\n\n1148\n00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,760\nYeah, that's right.\n\n1149\n00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,630\n>> Works well enough.\n\n1150\n00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,150\n>> Yes.\nMm-hm.\n\n1151\n00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,590\nNo, it works well, and\nthere's nothing to knock Hyper-V on here.\n\n1152\n00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,215\nThis is just another product\nthat we might choose to use.\n\n1153\n01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:05,370\nHyper-V is actually one of the pillars\nin the market of virtualization, so\n\n1154\n01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,940\nyou can't knock it for too much.\n\n1155\n01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,760\nIt actually does have incredible\nperformance as well, but XenCenter,\n\n1156\n01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,260\nI like its easy ability that we actually\nhave so far in terms of what we're doing.\n\n1157\n01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,600\nNotice I actually don't have to go and\nfind it too much.\n\n1158\n01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,470\nI just need an IP address, Nate.\n\n1159\n01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,700\nThat's all I needed, and look!\n\n1160\n01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,200\nIt gave me an installer.\n\n1161\n01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,570\nAnd then all I have to\ndo is click on finish.\n\n1162\n01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,510\n>> That is pretty convenient.\n\n1163\n01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,330\nYeah.\n\n1164\n01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,310\n>> Mm.\nYou know, before, yeah.\n\n1165\n01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:34,190\nYou know, actually, I’ll save that next\nstory until we actually connect to it\n\n1166\n01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:38,490\nthrough XenCenter, and\nthen I’ll share that whole story.\n\n1167\n01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,640\n>> All right, so I went ahead and\n\n1168\n01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,790\nI flipped on over to my start screen here,\nand in the search bar, I went ahead and\n\n1169\n01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,150\ntyped in XenCenter and\nit gives me this nice little icon.\n\n1170\n01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:51,840\nI could probably pin it to my\nstart menu if I wanted to.\n\n1171\n01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,190\nAnd where the heck did\nthat shoot pin it to.\n\n1172\n01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:53,690\nThere it goes.\n\n1173\n01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:02,580\nOh maybe I should not\ngonna let me move it?\n\n1174\n01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,790\nI'll just start it.\n\n1175\n01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:07,860\nThat works.\n\n1176\n01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,720\n>> So XenCenter, here we go.\n\n1177\n01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,590\n>> Yup.\n\n1178\n01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,370\nSo here we go, we are actually now\nconnecting to just a XenServer.\n\n1179\n01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,330\nAnd we haven't connected to the server yet\nper say, but\n\n1180\n01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,000\nwe're just launching this thing up and\n\n1181\n01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,030\nsomebody asked me if I want to check\nthe internet for XenServer updates.\n\n1182\n01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,460\nI'm gonna talk about that a little bit\nlater for right now let's go ahead and\n\n1183\n01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,898\nsay no for right now, just so that we\ncan get access into the system itself.\n\n1184\n01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:30,138\nAll right.\n\n1185\n01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:31,210\nSo, Nate,\n\n1186\n01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:37,080\nyou wanna know why I am impressed with\nthis immediate screen right here?\n\n1187\n01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,029\n>> You know, I would think.\n\n1188\n01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,980\n>> What?\nThat it says learn and add and\n\n1189\n01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,438\nupgrade, it's like really straight\nforward and tells you exactly what it is?\n\n1190\n01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:45,484\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n1191\n01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:47,420\n>> That where you should\ngo to do what you want.\n\n1192\n01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,710\n>> That's it, yeah.\n\n1193\n01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,720\n>> So the first time I actually installed\nthis, I was helping Don out, right, and\n\n1194\n01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,690\nhe was like, oh you can do this.\n\n1195\n01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,570\nAnd I was like, okay, well I'll try it.\n\n1196\n01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,950\nAnd it was literally this easy.\n\n1197\n01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,710\nSo now that I have the IP\naddress of our XenServer,\n\n1198\n01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,750\nright,\n>> I could go to the learn,\n\n1199\n01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,638\nand I'm just gonna select add,\nbecause that was easy enough for me to do.\n\n1200\n01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:10,170\nAnd, I don't have anything here\nthat I can type in that IP\n\n1201\n01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,845\naddress if I can remember it.\n\n1202\n01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:17,530\n230.206, and, if we remember,\nhopefully we remember.\n\n1203\n01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,020\n>> It's just all lowercase.\n\n1204\n01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,690\n>> Oh, he changed our odd password there.\n\n1205\n01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:23,709\n>> Every 45 days.\n\n1206\n01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,240\nAnd let's see if Nate actually\ntyped in the password correctly.\n\n1207\n01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,030\n[LAUGH] I'm joking.\n\n1208\n01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,032\nIf I typed in the password\ncorrectly then we should connect.\n\n1209\n01:02:34,032 --> 01:02:38,200\nAll right so here it tells us Xen can\nactually remember the log in credentials\n\n1210\n01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,480\nfor me if I want to.\n\n1211\n01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,850\nAnd I can save and\nrestore the connection state on startup.\n\n1212\n01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,300\nI can even require a master password, I'm\nnot gonna worry about it for right now.\n\n1213\n01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,500\n>> So that master password,\nis that our root password, or\n\n1214\n01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,430\nis our root password\n>> Now this is the one that we set up\n\n1215\n01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:52,980\nearlier, right?\n\n1216\n01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,730\nIt says to log in to your server.\n\n1217\n01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,990\nSo it says it protects all of\nyour server login credentials.\n\n1218\n01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:00,810\nSo if you're gonna do this, you need\nto enter the password at the beginning\n\n1219\n01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,780\nof every session, so it's not actually\ngonna allow you to skip all this.\n\n1220\n01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,210\n>> All right.\n\n1221\n01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,730\n>> Sound's good.\n\n1222\n01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,230\n>> Okay.\n\n1223\n01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:13,880\n>> And there it is over on\nthe left hand side I have my node\n\n1224\n01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,145\nwhich it the XenServer that\nNate set up here, okay?\n\n1225\n01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:20,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And at this point, I can see a lot of\n\n1226\n01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,950\ndetails for me that I can actually begin\nto take a look at and to manage here.\n\n1227\n01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:27,650\nOkay.\n\n1228\n01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,290\nSo notice if I just select XenServer.\n\n1229\n01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,390\nIt gives me the search option of all\nof the actual stuff that's on here.\n\n1230\n01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,630\nIt's even giving me\na little bit of a overview\n\n1231\n01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,620\nof the performance monitoring right here.\n\n1232\n01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,710\nCPU usage, memory, disk, network.\n\n1233\n01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:45,351\nThere are kind of the major four that we\ntake a look at in terms of performance.\n\n1234\n01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:48,601\nIf I click on general it\ngives me all of the regular.\n\n1235\n01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:50,111\nServer properties that I would need.\n\n1236\n01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:52,978\n>> Now, so-\n>> Memory.\n\n1237\n01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:54,310\n>> Sorry to cut you off there.\n\n1238\n01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,210\n>> No, that's fine.\n\n1239\n01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,790\n>> So on that tab right there, so\n\n1240\n01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:03,100\nwe can see the performance\nof the server as a whole.\n\n1241\n01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:03,730\n>> Right.\n>> Now,\n\n1242\n01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:08,230\nI know in HyperBay we can see\nthe performance of each individual VMs.\n\n1243\n01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,760\n>> Right.\n\n1244\n01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,060\nAnd so I am assuming that\nthat's gonna be up here soon.\n\n1245\n01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,250\nI guess as soon as we get some VMs.\n\n1246\n01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,710\n>> Yeah, once we start building some\nVMs here, we'll start seeing it.\n\n1247\n01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:18,240\nOkay?\n>> Nice.\n\n1248\n01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,620\n>> But there's a lot of\ndifferent things that we can do,\n\n1249\n01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,010\nand it not only has that ability to just\nallow us to see that, but notice we,\n\n1250\n01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,990\nof course, have the regular menus that\nwe're always pretty much used to.\n\n1251\n01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:33,220\nSo if you grew up in the age of\nmenu drop downs, you kind of, yes,\n\n1252\n01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,700\nthis is what I remember.\n\n1253\n01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,130\nAway from all these kind of\nicons up at the top here.\n\n1254\n01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:41,760\nAnd it's just the way that\nwe typically are here, okay?\n\n1255\n01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,030\nNow there's a couple of things, though,\nthat we do need to set up, okay?\n\n1256\n01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:49,880\nBefore we actually get too far into this,\nas well.\n\n1257\n01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,717\nBut, here is the basic management console\nthat we're gonna be working with to\n\n1258\n01:04:54,717 --> 01:04:58,360\nset up a VM, and to modify one,\nas well as what we see.\n\n1259\n01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,090\nOkay?\n\n1260\n01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:03,430\nNow when it starts out, right, once\nyou actually have XenServer installed,\n\n1261\n01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:06,480\na lot of times there\nactually have been updates.\n\n1262\n01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,700\nIt would actually be over here on\nthe right hand side, system alerts, but\n\n1263\n01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,920\nI told it not to check.\n\n1264\n01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,700\nIf I tell it to check it\nprobably will actually go, hey,\n\n1265\n01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:18,440\nthere's some other things that're actually\navailable for you right now to do.\n\n1266\n01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,070\nBut you do have to license this thing\nif you want those updates to come in.\n\n1267\n01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,770\nSo, for us to actually have done that\nwe would have gone to Tools, and\n\n1268\n01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:31,670\nwe would have actually selected\nthe idea of License Manager here.\n\n1269\n01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:36,070\nAnd, notice it says that right now,\nit's actually unsupported, okay?\n\n1270\n01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,650\nSo it says my maintenance has expired,\nI can buy a license here if I want to.\n\n1271\n01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,530\nI can actually assign a licence as well.\n\n1272\n01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:48,180\nI can download a Citrix License Server\nvirtual clients, you name it,\n\n1273\n01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,880\nit gives me those abilities to do so.\n\n1274\n01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,300\nSo if I actually had a license here,\nI could click here and\n\n1275\n01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:59,940\nthen go ahead and do that right here and\ntype in the actual licensing server,\n\n1276\n01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,440\nas well as tell it what\naddition we were doing.\n\n1277\n01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,270\nFor us it's this XenServer per socket,\nis what we would actually have here.\n\n1278\n01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,390\nSo for right now, let me see here.\n\n1279\n01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:13,540\nMaybe I actually do need to go in and\ncheck for the updates first.\n\n1280\n01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,600\nSee if I can get this, and\nsee that I can make it do it.\n\n1281\n01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,280\nSo you actually see right here,\n\n1282\n01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,250\nthat at this point there's several updates\nthat we actually have, and it actually\n\n1283\n01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:27,390\neven says that there's a new XenCenter\nthat's available for me right away.\n\n1284\n01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:30,560\nSo even without any licensing,\nanything else here, notice this\n\n1285\n01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,300\ngives me the ability to download this\nnew version of it right here as well.\n\n1286\n01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,440\nAnd then all these other\nones that you see,\n\n1287\n01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,482\nI'll probably have to manually\ninstall those if I want to.\n\n1288\n01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:45,819\n>> So Ronnie, so before you close on that,\nclick on one of those other updates.\n\n1289\n01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:48,470\nJust like the one there at the top.\n\n1290\n01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,908\nAll right so on each one of these updates,\nthat download and install button,\n\n1291\n01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:54,992\nit's grayed out.\n\n1292\n01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:56,012\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1293\n01:06:56,012 --> 01:07:00,680\n>> So is that where our free and\nour licensed copy,\n\n1294\n01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,710\nI guess like most free software you get\nit, and that's what you get in the node.\n\n1295\n01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:08,780\nGenerally you don't really get\nany support or future upgrades.\n\n1296\n01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,000\nBut so that's kind of where\nthat button's grayed out?\n\n1297\n01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,540\n>> Yup.\nSo if I were to go\n\n1298\n01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,630\nto the webpage here, where it has it.\n\n1299\n01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:21,340\nNotice I can actually download it,\nbut there is no automatic install.\n\n1300\n01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,790\nThis is where we have to run\nthat Xen command line tool.\n\n1301\n01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:29,650\nSo that is a little bit, again, tricky, if\nyou're not used to typing that stuff in,\n\n1302\n01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:34,579\nbut for free, this is a production level\n\n1303\n01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:40,140\nHyper-V server, that's actually\nrunning for us right here, okay?\n\n1304\n01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,490\nNow, there's a couple of other\nthings available for us too,\n\n1305\n01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:45,650\nlet me make sure as I go through, okay.\n\n1306\n01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,610\nSo, if I take a look at this menu bar,\nright?\n\n1307\n01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,320\nFile and View not so important.\n\n1308\n01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,670\nDon't get me wrong, we can have it.\n\n1309\n01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,260\nBut notice I can actually create a pool,\na resource pool.\n\n1310\n01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,390\nIf I had more than one XenServer, and\n\n1311\n01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,640\nI wanted to begin that idea of\nclustering them together, okay?\n\n1312\n01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,660\nWe can actually do it just\nby selecting New Pool, and\n\n1313\n01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:11,090\nthen we would create this pool here, and\nright now I'd have a XenServer here, and\n\n1314\n01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,940\nthen I could add in a new server, okay?\n\n1315\n01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:18,771\nSo, it's not difficult here,\nif I wanted to call this one\n\n1316\n01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:23,280\nXenPool.\n\n1317\n01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,649\nAnd notice, I have a master server,\nif I click on Add Server here.\n\n1318\n01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:34,480\nDuring the break, if I can remember\nthe IP address, I went ahead and\n\n1319\n01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,720\ndid another one, over on another computer\njust to see if this worked here.\n\n1320\n01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,900\nI can click Add, and notice it found it.\n\n1321\n01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,800\nI didn't even have\n\n1322\n01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,010\nto actually do any other setup-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1323\n01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,130\n>> On that other server.\n\n1324\n01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:49,990\nI did a basic install on it.\n\n1325\n01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,090\nWhat do you think Nate?\n\n1326\n01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:51,680\nSo far?\n\n1327\n01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,040\nPretty impressive?\n\n1328\n01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,417\n>> Oh no, okay,\n[CROSSTALK] That is pretty sweet.\n\n1329\n01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:58,045\nYou don't have to add anything\nto like a trusted host's\n\n1330\n01:08:58,045 --> 01:08:58,870\nfile\n>> Nope.\n\n1331\n01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,370\n>> Or anything of that sort,\nso that's [CROSSTALK].\n\n1332\n01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,260\n>> Yep.\n\n1333\n01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:06,320\nAnd so now, I actually have well, two.\n\n1334\n01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,830\nAnd so I can actually manage both of them.\n\n1335\n01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,520\nFrom this one location.\n\n1336\n01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,910\nNow they're not really clustered, right?\n\n1337\n01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:14,210\nThey're actually just giving\nme management in both.\n\n1338\n01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,695\nThey're even on different networks, Nate.\n\n1339\n01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:16,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1340\n01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,200\n>> And there it is.\n\n1341\n01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,244\nOne XenCenter managing two different\nservers, two different networks,\n\n1342\n01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:22,130\nnot really even clustered together.\n\n1343\n01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:25,770\nBut once we start actually putting\neverything onto a SAN and everything,\n\n1344\n01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,965\nstart sharing those resources out,\nthey will actually be clustered servers.\n\n1345\n01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:29,560\nMm-hm.\n\n1346\n01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,760\n>> Pretty neat.\n\n1347\n01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,130\n>> Now, that is pretty cool now, however,\n\n1348\n01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:37,470\nin Hyper-V Manager we can add more\nHyper-V servers within Hyper-V Manager,\n\n1349\n01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:42,890\nand so it, very cool, don't get me wrong,\nbut I'm still not quite blown away yet.\n\n1350\n01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,406\n>> Sure, you know you are.\n\n1351\n01:09:44,406 --> 01:09:46,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, there it is,\n\n1352\n01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:50,340\nthere's a lot of different\nthings that we can begin to do.\n\n1353\n01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:54,120\nNow, we're pretty much at this point where\nwe're ready to start doing a couple of\n\n1354\n01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,940\nother things for us here,\nsuch as creating a new VM, but\n\n1355\n01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,500\nbefore we do that,\nwe have to get a couple things ready here,\n\n1356\n01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,810\nsuch as the idea of creating, how\nthe heck do I get access to these ISOs.\n\n1357\n01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:10,300\nSo I need to actually be able to do that\nas well, when we set this thing up here.\n\n1358\n01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,570\nSo at this point, let's see where we\nare in our time before we get into it.\n\n1359\n01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:17,450\nDo a little bit too much here and\n\n1360\n01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:21,660\nnot be able to get access to what I need,\nis where I'm going.\n\n1361\n01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:24,910\n>> Now Ronnie, so the server that we have,\n\n1362\n01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:29,720\nwe store all of our ISOs on,\nI robbed its network adapter.\n\n1363\n01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,610\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> There's no connection, so if you try to\n\n1364\n01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:37,950\nset up that storage repository,\nyou may not be able to complete it.\n\n1365\n01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:38,940\n>> Yeah, that's fine.\n\n1366\n01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,893\nSo at this point here, what we're\ngonna do to get everything set up and\n\n1367\n01:10:42,893 --> 01:10:47,056\nmake sure that we can get connected,\nis to go ahead and check a few things.\n\n1368\n01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:51,398\nMaybe get connected back to our storage\npool repository before we can do anything.\n\n1369\n01:10:51,398 --> 01:10:55,320\nAnd then we can come back and\ncreate an actual server right away.\n\n1370\n01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,350\n>> All right, so yeah,\nthat's what you wanna do?\n\n1371\n01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,260\n>> That's what we should do.\n\n1372\n01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:58,820\n>> Sweet.\n\n1373\n01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,640\nAll right.\n\n1374\n01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,520\nOkay.\nSo let's go and do that.\n\n1375\n01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,660\nSo we are coming up here on break time,\nso to move forward with creating our VMs,\n\n1376\n01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:12,340\nwe do need those ISOs, and so I'll\nconnect that server back to the network.\n\n1377\n01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,210\nAnd here on break time,\nwe'll connect that stuff?\n\n1378\n01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:15,960\n>> Sounds good!\n\n1379\n01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,865\n>> Sweet, all right,\nwe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n1380\n01:11:18,865 --> 01:11:27,170\n>> [SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n1381\n01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,120\nAll right, so where we left off, right,\n\n1382\n01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,890\nwe got some of the configuration\nleft to do, a few items.\n\n1383\n01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,260\nWe gotta add in a little repository for\nour ISOs,\n\n1384\n01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,650\nso we can have something\nto Install onto our VMs.\n\n1385\n01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:45,136\nWe had to create a,\njust kind of a basic virtual machine,\n\n1386\n01:11:45,136 --> 01:11:48,420\nsomething that we can just spin up and\nuse right away.\n\n1387\n01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,567\n>> Yep.\n\n1388\n01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:52,753\nSo for us in terms of connecting to this,\nright,\n\n1389\n01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:57,882\nall we have to do is go up to Storage,\nAnd select new SR for storage repository,\n\n1390\n01:11:57,882 --> 01:12:02,320\nand then we are actually gonna\nget access to this ISO library.\n\n1391\n01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,990\nI created it on a Windows share, so\nI'm gonna select Windows File Sharing and\n\n1392\n01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:13,500\nthen click Next here and from here\nwe're actually creating an ISO library.\n\n1393\n01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,660\nEvery ISO that you actually want to build\na crate again virtual machines off of,\n\n1394\n01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,820\nI can store it here in this figure folder.\n\n1395\n01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:24,460\nNext, and the key to remember here\nbecause I just tried this and\n\n1396\n01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:28,590\nit didn't work, is to not do this\non the actual machine that you're\n\n1397\n01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:31,710\nworking on in terms of where\nzen server actually is.\n\n1398\n01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:36,650\nSo it does not like that, so I went\nahead and created it to another share.\n\n1399\n01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:41,540\nAnd now I'm going to actually go ahead and\nenter in my other credentials\n\n1400\n01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:47,800\nto let it mount there with my\ncredentials and there it goes, okay.\n\n1401\n01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,160\nSo at this point,\nI went ahead and created it and\n\n1402\n01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,480\nnow I have an iso library link\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n1403\n01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,890\nAnd now, in my ISO library link.\n\n1404\n01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:00,830\nThere it is, it actually sees\nthe share and the storage.\n\n1405\n01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,230\nIt's actually right there, and\nit sees the virtual disk, okay?\n\n1406\n01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:07,630\nThere is the ISO I actually have ready.\n\n1407\n01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:12,410\nAs I add in more, it will refresh every\ntime unless you continue to populate here.\n\n1408\n01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,385\nFrom this point, we can create a VM.\n\n1409\n01:13:14,385 --> 01:13:15,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1410\n01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:15,830\n>> Right.\n\n1411\n01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,500\n>> All right, so\n\n1412\n01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:22,540\nif we are creating that VM Ronny, what's\nthe first steps now that we have our iso.\n\n1413\n01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,910\n>> Again, a couple of easy things that\nactually makes it very nice here,\n\n1414\n01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:29,190\nof course, is to be able to take a look\nat some of the simple tools that\n\n1415\n01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:29,870\nwe have available.\n\n1416\n01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:33,350\nI am just going to select this\nfirst Zen server to create it on.\n\n1417\n01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:36,770\nWe are, again distributing this, so\nwe don't have to tell it where to put it,\n\n1418\n01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,610\nwe could actually go ahead and create it.\n\n1419\n01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,590\nEven up here in the pool,\nnotice I could create a new VM there.\n\n1420\n01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:43,780\nI'm just gonna do it on the local machine.\n\n1421\n01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,285\nSelect the link here that says New VM.\n\n1422\n01:13:46,285 --> 01:13:47,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1423\n01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,460\n>> And now we have different templates,\nright?\n\n1424\n01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,650\nThe templates here are not\nthe ISOs themselves.\n\n1425\n01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,500\nIn other words, they're not\nthe installation of the operating system.\n\n1426\n01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,830\nWhat they are are essentially\nthe hardware virtualization.\n\n1427\n01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:02,000\nWhat the requirements\nare on this bigger machine.\n\n1428\n01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,978\nSo the one that I actually have is\ngoing to be Windows 8, here, 64-bit.\n\n1429\n01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,760\nMine's actually 8.1.\n\n1430\n01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,480\nI haven't updated this server.\n\n1431\n01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,370\nIf I had updated it,\nI'd even get the new features there.\n\n1432\n01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,750\nAnd I can copy the host's\nbiostring if I want\n\n1433\n01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,290\nto make it report like there's\nactually a bios on the individual.\n\n1434\n01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:27,031\nI'm not gonna worry about\non the individual BM.\n\n1435\n01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:28,140\nSo let me select here.\n\n1436\n01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,505\nAnd then we'll just call\nthis one Windows 8.\n\n1437\n01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:33,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1438\n01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:36,370\nNice and descriptive name.\n\n1439\n01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,740\n>> Yep.\n\n1440\n01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:41,940\nAnd then it's going to ask me where do I\nwant to actually install the operating\n\n1441\n01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,090\nsystem from.\n\n1442\n01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:47,910\nSo, because I actually went ahead and\nattached this to that one Zen server,\n\n1443\n01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,260\nI would install it from here.\n\n1444\n01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:52,890\nI could have attached it to the entire\npool, if I wanted to, and that way from\n\n1445\n01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:56,720\neach particular server, it could reach\nout and grab it from right there.\n\n1446\n01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,670\nI'm just going to leave it\nhere to make it nice and easy.\n\n1447\n01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,860\n>> I see the little radio dial\nbeneath that boot front network,\n\n1448\n01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,680\nso that's the pixie boot.\n\n1449\n01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,700\nIs that correct?\n\n1450\n01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:10,350\nSo if we did have a deployment\nserver out there on the network\n\n1451\n01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:11,770\nwe can just select this option here.\n\n1452\n01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,470\nWhen we spin up this VM it'll reach\nout to that deployment server and\n\n1453\n01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:16,350\npull it's image down.\n\n1454\n01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,160\n>> Sure.\nNice.\n\n1455\n01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:17,660\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1456\n01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:19,470\nYup.\n\n1457\n01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,070\nAnd then it's gonna ask me\nwhere I wanna place it.\n\n1458\n01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:23,650\nIf I had connected it to\nthe actual pool itself,\n\n1459\n01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,770\nit could've actually placed it\nbetween one of the two here.\n\n1460\n01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:30,035\nWe could have picked which one is its\nhome server, but I I just went in and\n\n1461\n01:15:30,035 --> 01:15:31,485\nselected it.\n\n1462\n01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:35,515\nSo, I'm gonna actually place\nit on this one, all right.\n\n1463\n01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,925\n>> And\nthen it's asking me the number of CPUs.\n\n1464\n01:15:40,925 --> 01:15:42,480\nI'm not gonna give it all four gigs.\n\n1465\n01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,442\n[LAUGH] Guess I could but\n\n1466\n01:15:44,442 --> 01:15:48,760\nlet me kinda downgrade that\njust by about two gigs here.\n\n1467\n01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,520\nWell maybe I can't.\n\n1468\n01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:56,440\nIt's not letting me use the spin\nup dial very easily, all right?\n\n1469\n01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,730\nSo once you put in two gigabytes of RAM.\n\n1470\n01:15:58,730 --> 01:15:59,270\nYup.\n\n1471\n01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,770\n>> All right.\n\n1472\n01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,950\n>> Let's be generous with the CPUs there.\n\n1473\n01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:03,700\nLet's do two.\n\n1474\n01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,480\nNice [LAUGH].\n\n1475\n01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,230\n>> All right.\n\n1476\n01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,050\nSo there it's actually gonna do that.\n\n1477\n01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:14,420\nI'm gonna create just a standard VHD file\nor the actual one that's actually in here.\n\n1478\n01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,760\nAnd I can remember it's VDI or\nsomething like that,\n\n1479\n01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,700\nwhatever the XenServer wants\nactually are by default here.\n\n1480\n01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,320\nSo it's gonna create a 24 gig file,\nis what it's gonna do.\n\n1481\n01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,640\nAnd then allow me to expand\nthat out if I need to.\n\n1482\n01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:31,510\nSo I can click on properties here,\nand if I wanted to,\n\n1483\n01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,310\nI could expand it out even right here.\n\n1484\n01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:40,370\nLet's just do a 64 gig one,\nprobably doesn't like the thousand there.\n\n1485\n01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,540\nNotice I can actually create it up to\nwell megabytes and terabytes here.\n\n1486\n01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:48,570\nWe're going to do it on the local storage\nand on using that template set up,\n\n1487\n01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:53,990\nso I didn't actually have to select a lot,\njust the ID of the CPU and how much RAM.\n\n1488\n01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,640\nFrom this point it's gonna\nconnect me to the default network\n\n1489\n01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,990\nthat it already generated by default here.\n\n1490\n01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:04,350\nWe can create those special networks as\nwell to isolate a network if we wanted to.\n\n1491\n01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:10,290\nSo this is gonna attach it to the default\none that XenServer actually has for us.\n\n1492\n01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:13,120\nAll right.\nIt's gonna autogenerate a new MAC address\n\n1493\n01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,930\nand a virtual NIC.\n\n1494\n01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,070\nAnd that's gonna give me a summary\nof everything that I have, and\n\n1495\n01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:22,900\nat the end here it says, hey create it\nI want to start it automatically so\n\n1496\n01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:27,610\nI can create now and\nin just a moment here, let's see if\n\n1497\n01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:32,240\nactually does spin it up here,\nwe should start seeing one get created.\n\n1498\n01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,780\nThere it goes, okay?\n\n1499\n01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,860\nSo, it went ahead and took a moment here,\n\n1500\n01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,880\nbut you see the Windows\n8 VM is now started.\n\n1501\n01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,020\nAnd now notice all of the actual\nproperties here are kind of tabbed out.\n\n1502\n01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,660\nAnd if I go to console,\n\n1503\n01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:52,200\nthis is as if I were sitting there on\nthe network, oh it did not like that.\n\n1504\n01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,060\nI forgot the ISO library.\n\n1505\n01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,360\nI forgot to actually put\nit in the Library itself.\n\n1506\n01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:00,540\nSo now we have to restart that thing.\n\n1507\n01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,080\nForce reboot it.\n\n1508\n01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:08,670\nSo apparently I did not\nselect the actual proper ISO.\n\n1509\n01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:12,590\nSo, give it a moment here to restart it.\n\n1510\n01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,070\nAlright, there it goes.\n\n1511\n01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:19,010\nSo now, it's actually in the install\nprocess of where Windows 8 is\n\n1512\n01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:23,400\nactually gonna run through the install,\n8.1 is gonna run through the install here.\n\n1513\n01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,420\nAnd, just take its time here and\ndo all the things it's doing.\n\n1514\n01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,260\nSo, there it goes.\n\n1515\n01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,730\n>> That is a cool cursor you have there,\nnormally.\n\n1516\n01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,790\nI'm used to seeing like the arrow.\n\n1517\n01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n1518\n01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,100\n>> But in there we get the square.\n\n1519\n01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,084\n>> Yeah because of the way\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1520\n01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:40,062\n>> The actual video technology works,\n\n1521\n01:18:40,062 --> 01:18:42,791\nthis particular console\ncable is a fake console.\n\n1522\n01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,088\nSo, it doesn't like the\n\n1523\n01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:45,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> way it does it.\n\n1524\n01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,210\nNow you can actually see that I have\n>> Oh there it is\n\n1525\n01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:49,205\n>> An arrow as well as a dot.\n\n1526\n01:18:49,205 --> 01:18:52,096\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so it doesn't like this.\n\n1527\n01:18:52,096 --> 01:18:52,704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But for\n\n1528\n01:18:52,704 --> 01:18:55,360\nus\n>> We're just gonna use it to go ahead and\n\n1529\n01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,000\ntry and see if I can get access.\n\n1530\n01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,730\nAnd then select install now, and\nthere goes the process here, okay?\n\n1531\n01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,870\nSo it's not fancy in terms\nof the console itself.\n\n1532\n01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:10,490\nI don't have it set up for remote, but\nonce I do and get everything ready,\n\n1533\n01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:15,190\nI can remote into it like a regular\nVM at this point, and keep it going.\n\n1534\n01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:19,380\n>> All right, sweet so let's see oh yeah.\n\n1535\n01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:25,030\nI guess we'll just continue on and finish\nthe yup, installation processed this.\n\n1536\n01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,880\nAt this point,\n\n1537\n01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,270\neven though it is a virtual machine, this\none will just be a typical installation.\n\n1538\n01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:30,850\n>> Ace install.\n\n1539\n01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,400\n>> Yup.\nAnyone who has installed Windows 8 before,\n\n1540\n01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,000\nthis process should be pretty\nfamiliar; nothing different\n\n1541\n01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,050\nas opposed to being in a virtual machine.\n\n1542\n01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:44,210\nThe hardest thing for us is making sure\nthat that storage repository is connected.\n\n1543\n01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,862\nI tried to connect it to a storage\nrepository on my own machine that was\n\n1544\n01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:48,890\nrunning zen server,\nit wouldn't have any of that.\n\n1545\n01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,741\nAs soon as I gave it another network\nshare, it worked perfectly fine.\n\n1546\n01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:55,062\nSo that took me a little bit of time,\nbut that's pretty much the key here.\n\n1547\n01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:55,735\nOkay.\n\n1548\n01:19:55,735 --> 01:19:59,740\nSo the install process in\ngetting it up and running.\n\n1549\n01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:04,640\nFrom installing XenServer to the point\nof installing XenCenter getting\n\n1550\n01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,310\nthe storage repository up and\ngetting a virtual machine started.\n\n1551\n01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:12,740\nIf we weren't sitting here explaining it\nit could actually take just about ten or\n\n1552\n01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,000\nfifteen minutes and\n\n1553\n01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,150\nwe'd be up and running in terms of\ngetting ready to actually install VM's.\n\n1554\n01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,120\nNow because we actually took\na little bit of time to explain it,\n\n1555\n01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,950\nwe wanted you to see some\nof the features here.\n\n1556\n01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,730\nTakes a little bit more time.\n\n1557\n01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:27,370\nBut overall though, if you're on a high\nperformance server this wouldn't actually\n\n1558\n01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:30,495\ntake any time at all in terms\nof spinning up the the VM.\n\n1559\n01:20:30,495 --> 01:20:35,295\nThe nice thing about doing this,\nis the ability to also create a template.\n\n1560\n01:20:35,295 --> 01:20:38,355\nSo that I can clone this\nmachine right away.\n\n1561\n01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:41,365\nAnd actually have it build another\none once it's actually done.\n\n1562\n01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:43,235\nAnd now make that a template as well.\n\n1563\n01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:45,930\nSo, with the operative system\ninstalled and everything.\n\n1564\n01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:48,890\nI don't have to ask you to rebuild this\never again in terms of installing unless\n\n1565\n01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,150\nI wanted to.\n\n1566\n01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:53,380\nI'd just make it a template,\nand then spin the template up.\n\n1567\n01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,259\nIt's ready to go at this point,\n\n1568\n01:20:55,259 --> 01:21:00,570\nand we're to actually rock with two\nWindows 8.1 machines that we needed to.\n\n1569\n01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,610\nSo it's pretty neat.\n\n1570\n01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,240\n>> Nice.\n\n1571\n01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,010\nAll right, Ronnie, well good deal, well.\n\n1572\n01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,320\nWe do have quite a bit of\ntime left on our break here,\n\n1573\n01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,280\nbut we do need to wait for this virtual\nmachine to finish installing, so\n\n1574\n01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,220\nwe can take a look at some of its specs.\n\n1575\n01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,900\nWe gotta add it and take a look at its\nperformance, and those sorts of things.\n\n1576\n01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,860\nNow the next set that we do have\nlined up is to create an advanced VM.\n\n1577\n01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:29,220\nSo or an advanced, or\nI guess more like a customized.\n\n1578\n01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,140\nCustomized virtual machine\nI guess think of it\n\n1579\n01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:37,820\nkind of like a scenario that we'll have\nand spin up some machines that route.\n\n1580\n01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,410\n>> Right.\n\n1581\n01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:42,530\n>> But,\nwe'll say that after this guy finishes.\n\n1582\n01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:46,420\nRonnie, anything else before\nwe wrap this one up right now?\n\n1583\n01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:49,330\n>> Nope, so we've brought you through to\nthe point where we've installed an actual\n\n1584\n01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:49,930\nVM here.\n\n1585\n01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,850\nSo, it's in the process of installing.\n\n1586\n01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,780\nIt will work and when we come back for\n\n1587\n01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,060\nour next series we'll see\nthis machine working.\n\n1588\n01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:59,290\nI'm also go ahead and install the\nWindows Server 2012 machine on there and\n\n1589\n01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:02,720\nwe'll create some advanced features,\nor some customized features for us\n\n1590\n01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,680\nin this environment and see how well they\nactually work together for us as well.\n\n1591\n01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,130\nSo, at this point, you've seen a lot.\n\n1592\n01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:12,990\nIt actually works very well and\nfairly simple to install.\n\n1593\n01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,060\nSo, again,\nbe familiar with this technology.\n\n1594\n01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,440\nYou're gonna see it everywhere.\n\n1595\n01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,560\n>> All right, well we'll go ahead and\nwrap it up right here.\n\n1596\n01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,000\nWe do have a bit to go through but\nthis will be all for now.\n\n1597\n01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,600\nIf you ever have any\nquestions during the show,\n\n1598\n01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,100\nright below our live page we have\na little chat monitor lined up.\n\n1599\n01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,120\nGo ahead, type stuff in there, blow it up.\n\n1600\n01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,080\nWe got a little monitor here we\ncan respond and get back to you.\n\n1601\n01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,900\nIf you ever have any questions after\nthe show, you can jump into the Q and\n\n1602\n01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,470\nA section at the top of every webpage.\n\n1603\n01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,610\nJump into the forums and\ndrop us a line, we'll get back to you.\n\n1604\n01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:47,940\nAnd if you're ever away from your PC you\ncan always check us out on the Roku,\n\n1605\n01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:52,770\nwe've got a channel up there and\nwatch us on the comfort of your own couch.\n\n1606\n01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:56,300\nAll right, well signing out for\nITProTV, I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1607\n01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:56,900\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n1608\n01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,766\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1609\n01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:08,766\n[MUSIC]\n\n1610\n01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:15,610\n[NOISE]\n\n",
