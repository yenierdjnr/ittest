  "description": "The Cloud Fundamentals video series is designed to introduce the viewer to cloud computing, which works from providers that can have thousands of servers and have more than enough hardware and CPU resources to support their systems and they rent out the extra capacity to users so the potential is not wasted. Positions like system administrators, developers and CIOs all benefit from implementing cloud technology. Cloud concepts and theory are discussed and then actual deployment examples of practical applications are demonstrated using Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.",

another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,360\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,420\nHere with me today is none\nother than Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,770\nHow you doing today Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,800\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900\nAnd you know I'm excited to\nkick off a new series here on\n\n9\n00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,060\nITProTV our Cloud Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,935\nThis is going to be a series of episodes\nall tailored to introducing you\n\n11\n00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:35,088\nthe viewer, to the cloud which is like\nthe most nebulous term in the world.\n\n12\n00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,336\nWell, I guess nebula's are clouds I\ndon't know how that works out, or not.\n\n13\n00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,885\nBut it's a buzz word that\ngets thrown around a lot.\n\n14\n00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:41,715\nA lot a lot of people don't really\nrealize what's going on with it.\n\n15\n00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:45,005\nSo we're gonna decipher the mystery and\nkind of thin that out.\n\n16\n00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,295\nWe're going to start off with a few\nepisodes that are just going to detail\n\n17\n00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,530\ncloud concepts.\n\n18\n00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,990\nAnd then we're going to follow off\nwith some real world examples.\n\n19\n00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,170\nShow you how to implement cloud\ntechnologies, how to make use of them.\n\n20\n00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,240\nWe'll get some chances to see, like,\nAmazon EC2, and Microsoft Azure, and\n\n21\n00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840\nthose guys in action.\n\n22\n00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,020\nBut before we dive into all that,\nlet's just start with the basics.\n\n23\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,410\nWhat is the cloud?\n\n24\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,790\nNow, if somebody comes to you and\nsays, hey,\n\n25\n00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840\nI need to get my stuff in the cloud,\nthey could mean several different things.\n\n26\n00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,970\nSo let's back it all the way back up\nto where this technology came from,\n\n27\n00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,100\nback in the 1970s.\n\n28\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,280\nThat's right, we're gonna go,\nwe're going old school.\n\n29\n00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,415\nSo back 40 years ago.\n\n30\n00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,635\nWe started to see virtualize\ncomputing infrastructure.\n\n31\n00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:30,065\nHe's on a mainframe mostly like the old\nVAC systems and things like that.\n\n32\n00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,885\nThey had virtualization in them.\n\n33\n00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:36,535\nAnd then the technology kind of died off\nin the late 80s and then in the late 90s,\n\n34\n00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:38,835\nit started to come back again.\n\n35\n00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,825\nAnd we started seeing this\nvirtualization movement kick in, and\n\n36\n00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,880\nit's what really led to the cloud.\n\n37\n00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,550\nSo virtualization is really the heart of\nthis and if you don't know what that is.\n\n38\n00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,570\nWell virtualization is probably one of the\ncoolest technologies to be implemented on\n\n39\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,040\nmodern networks.\n\n40\n00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,910\nWhat it is, the way I always describe it,\nis it's kind of like car pooling for\n\n41\n00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,290\ncomputers, right?\n\n42\n00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,800\nIf you think about your car.\n\n43\n00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,858\nI drove to the studio this morning\nin a car that has five seats in it,\n\n44\n00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,750\nand I was the only person in it.\n\n45\n00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,390\nSo that meant I had four seats in my car\nthat were empty that I could've used,\n\n46\n00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,320\nbut I waste it.\n\n47\n00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,760\nSo I really only use 20% of\nthe potential of my vehicle,\n\n48\n00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,730\nas far as moving people\nfrom one place to another.\n\n49\n00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,830\nWell that's where your computer is.\n\n50\n00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,780\nI've got a laptop sitting\nhere in front of me.\n\n51\n00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,760\nIt's got 16 gigs of RAM in it.\n\n52\n00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,650\nI'm probably using two\ngigs of ram right now.\n\n53\n00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,050\nThe other memory just wasted.\n\n54\n00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,600\nCPU, I don't really know.\n\n55\n00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000\nI think I've got a quad-core processor.\n\n56\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120\nShow's what I know.\n\n57\n00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,070\nSo I'm probably using one CPU, and\nbarely a percent is that right now.\n\n58\n00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,980\nThe rest of it is being wasted.\n\n59\n00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,170\nThat's how our computers are.\n\n60\n00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,570\nWe waste a lot of resources,\nbut we want them\n\n61\n00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,670\nbecause there will come a time when\nI need it, where I need that memory.\n\n62\n00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,910\nI need that CPU, and I need it to be here.\n\n63\n00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,130\nSo, I have it, and\nI just waste what's extra.\n\n64\n00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,633\nWith virtualization what we do, is we\ntake more than one operating system and\n\n65\n00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,420\nwe run it on the same computer.\n\n66\n00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,220\nWe run it on the same hardware.\n\n67\n00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,690\nAnd now, you know, I might only\nbe using two gigs of memory, but\n\n68\n00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,110\nI've got another operating system\nthat's using two more gigs.\n\n69\n00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,150\nAnd a third operating system\nthat's using two more.\n\n70\n00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,930\nAnd between the three of us\nwe're all using six gigs of RAM.\n\n71\n00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,830\nNow we're actually starting to use\nthe hardware that's available to us,\n\n72\n00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,780\nwe're starting to get our money's worth.\n\n73\n00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,900\nAnd that's the principle\nbehind virtualization.\n\n74\n00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500\nThat's where products like VMWare,\nvSphere and\n\n75\n00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,510\nMicrosoft HyperV, Citrix Zen Server,\nKVM, all those other different software\n\n76\n00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,850\nvirtualization products that are out\nthere, and their hardware counterparts.\n\n77\n00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,480\nAll of that works on the simple\nprinciple of carpooling for servers.\n\n78\n00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,150\nWell, once that started to catch on,\nand remember,\n\n79\n00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,120\nthis really came about in the 1970s.\n\n80\n00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,870\nBut it wasn't until the late 90s that\nVMWare really pushed into businesses.\n\n81\n00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,430\nAnd we're to a point now in the year 2015,\nwhere If you're a business and\n\n82\n00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,480\nyou don't have virtualization of one form\nor another, you're behind the curve.\n\n83\n00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,340\nEverybody's pretty much implement\nthis in one form or another.\n\n84\n00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,300\nWell, providers like Amazon, Microsoft.\n\n85\n00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,060\nThese companies that are huge, that tens\nof thousands of servers around the world.\n\n86\n00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,800\nGoogle, Rackspace these guys have tons\nof hardware to support their systems.\n\n87\n00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,570\nAnd it's more than they need.\n\n88\n00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,100\nAnd so what do they do with\nthe extra stuff goes to waste?\n\n89\n00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,570\nWell used to,\n\n90\n00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,030\nnow thanks to virtualization they can\nrent out their extra space to customers.\n\n91\n00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,190\nIf you need a server with a certain amount\nof memory, instead of building yourself\n\n92\n00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,825\nyou can just go rent it from Microsoft's\nleftovers, or Amazon's leftovers.\n\n93\n00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,220\nBecause they got a ton, right?\n\n94\n00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,990\nTens of thousands of us around the globe.\n\n95\n00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,290\nGoogle, they probably\nhave the most of anybody.\n\n96\n00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,300\nThey've got reserves, they've got extra\nCPU, extra memory laying around, and\n\n97\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,000\nI don't mean like chips laying on a shelf.\n\n98\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,025\nAlthough they they do that too.\n\n99\n00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I mean,\n\n100\n00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,660\nactive servers that are running,\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n101\n00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,470\nThat just aren't being used to\nthey're fullest utilization.\n\n102\n00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,640\nAnd we can take advantage of that.\n\n103\n00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,820\nAnd that is the cloud.\n\n104\n00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,470\nIt's using these servers.\n\n105\n00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,530\nThese things that\nare connected to the internet.\n\n106\n00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,600\nThey just aren't being used right now.\n\n107\n00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,130\nIt's just kind of available and\nbeing wasted.\n\n108\n00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,210\nSo you can thank technologies\nlike VMware ESX server.\n\n109\n00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,500\nOr Microsoft's Hyper V.\n\n110\n00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,510\nOr Virtual Box, or any of\nthe virtualization products out there.\n\n111\n00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,700\nFor leading to what we all\nthink of today as a cloud.\n\n112\n00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200\n>> And it's very convenient too.\n\n113\n00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,710\nI love virtualization, to be able to run\nmobile operating systems on my laptop,\n\n114\n00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,340\nkind of like Don was talking about.\n\n115\n00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,000\nBut the cost of it is so\nmuch more economical than me going, well,\n\n116\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,030\nI need another server, or\nI need another, even a desktop system.\n\n117\n00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,910\nI don't have to actually buy that system.\n\n118\n00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,730\nI can say hey I can use one\nof these cloud technologies.\n\n119\n00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,820\nI can go to Amazon.\n\n120\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,350\nI can go to Microsoft Azure and\nuse some of that.\n\n121\n00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,450\nAnd let them foot the bill, and\ntake care of all that stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,220\nI just need the server to run.\n\n123\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,140\nMakes it really simple for me.\n\n124\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,890\n>> Now where it gets confusing is,\n\n125\n00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,170\nwhen you decide to implement\na technology in the cloud.\n\n126\n00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,050\nYou have different layers, different\nlevels that you can kind of buy in.\n\n127\n00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,440\nIt's like a poker game.\n\n128\n00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,780\nYou can you can bet a little bit, or\n\n129\n00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,280\nyou can go all in and\nput all your chips into that bet.\n\n130\n00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,450\nWell that's how the cloud is.\n\n131\n00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,130\nSo when you reach out and you start\nto reserve these cloud resources.\n\n132\n00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,800\nIt's up to you how far in you want to go,\nall right?\n\n133\n00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560\nSome people just tab their\ntoe in a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,010\nThey rent that server hardware.\n\n135\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,560\nThey go to Amazon EC2 or\nthey go to Microsoft Azure, and\n\n136\n00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,700\nthey rent CPU and memory.\n\n137\n00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500\nAnd they put their\noperating system on there.\n\n138\n00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,910\nThey put their software on there.\n\n139\n00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,660\nThey manage it just like they would\na server in their own environment.\n\n140\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,140\nBut the hardware is what's\nout there in the cloud.\n\n141\n00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,360\nAnd they're renting that from that\nprovider whoever that happens to be,\n\n142\n00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120\nto get the access to that system.\n\n143\n00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,670\nNow that's one way to go about it.\n\n144\n00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,260\nAnd the nice part there is the hardware\nis completely handled by that vendor.\n\n145\n00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,630\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n146\n00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,980\nYou manage everything\nelse as far as the OS.\n\n147\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,800\nJust like you would a server\nsitting right next to you.\n\n148\n00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,940\nSo it's easy to implement that way, and\n\n149\n00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,330\nyou start to take advantage of some\nof what the cloud has to offer.\n\n150\n00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280\nThen we can go a step further.\n\n151\n00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760\nAnd we can say, well you know what,\nthey're managing our hardware.\n\n152\n00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,710\nWouldn't it be nice if they\nmanaged the operating system too?\n\n153\n00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,090\nAnd now they can manage the hardware and\nthe operating system, and\n\n154\n00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,810\nwe just throw our software on top.\n\n155\n00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,840\nAnd now we just have to\nkeep track of our software.\n\n156\n00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,290\nThat's a little bit further\ninto the cloud, right?\n\n157\n00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,810\nNow you're starting to kind of eliminate\n\n158\n00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,360\nyour ability to control certain\nareas as far as hardware and the OS.\n\n159\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,940\nAnd then there's going all in.\n\n160\n00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,480\nAnd going all in,\nthat's where you say, you know what?\n\n161\n00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,010\nI want this provider out there on\nthe cloud to take care of the hardware,\n\n162\n00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,300\nthe operating system, the software,\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n163\n00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,480\nI just wanna use my programs.\n\n164\n00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,130\nAnd that's really where\nmost of our consumers are.\n\n165\n00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,130\nAnd most of you guys who are watching\nthe show are probably doing this.\n\n166\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,170\nIf you if you use web based email, like I\nuse Gmail for some of my personal email.\n\n167\n00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,586\nAnd with Google, they provide the servers,\nthey provide the OS,\n\n168\n00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,052\nthey provide the software.\n\n169\n00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,420\nI just log into a web page and\nthere's my email.\n\n170\n00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,541\nI didn't configure anything.\n\n171\n00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:58,766\nOn one hand, I get super easy to use\nemail that is on world class servers and\n\n172\n00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:04,610\nworld class data centers,\nit's really more than I could do myself.\n\n173\n00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,300\nOn the other hand,\nI have zero control of that server.\n\n174\n00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,750\nIf I say, boy,\nI really wish they offered S/MIME support.\n\n175\n00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,868\nWell, they don't, and\nthere's nothing I can do about that.\n\n176\n00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:20,110\nIn fact, there's no real way to contact\nGoogle to even ask them, right.\n\n177\n00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,140\nSo you're really leaving it up to\nthem to control those features and\n\n178\n00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,980\nso on,\nwe're just not able to deal with that.\n\n179\n00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,290\nSo that's one of the challenges\nthat you bump into.\n\n180\n00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,640\nIf you need a lot of control, going\nfull cloud is not necessarily an option.\n\n181\n00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,220\nYou might have to go with\none of the smaller options.\n\n182\n00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,810\nSo that's something we\nneed to be aware of,\n\n183\n00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,380\nis that there are different levels of\nbuy in when it comes to using the cloud.\n\n184\n00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,760\n>> Now Don, is there necessarily a right\nor wrong implementation of the cloud, or\n\n185\n00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,410\nit's just whatever's curtailed to your-\n>> According to the trade magazines,\n\n186\n00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,114\nthey're all right.\n\n187\n00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,473\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You should be using the cloud!\n\n188\n00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:58,880\nI think that it's not so much about being\nwrong as it is being sub-optimal, right.\n\n189\n00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,280\nThat there's some people that have certain\nneeds, and when you go into the cloud,\n\n190\n00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,210\nyou might not be taking advantage\nof all that the cloud has to offer.\n\n191\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,350\nOr maybe you're taking into too much,\nand now you've put yourself at risk.\n\n192\n00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,420\nLike if your company handles\nfinancial records or medical records,\n\n193\n00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,950\nyou might put too much data into the cloud\nand then the cloud gets compromised.\n\n194\n00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,190\nAnd now those records are out and\nyou have a debacle.\n\n195\n00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,090\nYou should have maintained more control so\nyou can encrypt your data and\n\n196\n00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,180\nguarantee security.\n\n197\n00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,370\nSo you do have to be careful\nabout things like that.\n\n198\n00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,030\nBut it's not so much about right or\n\n199\n00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,540\nwrong as it is just making sure\nthat you take proper precautions.\n\n200\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,430\nSo, all right, now when we go into\nthe cloud what most people think of\n\n201\n00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,420\nas the cloud is is what's actually\ncalled the public cloud, all right.\n\n202\n00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,000\nAmazon's Web services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Rackspace,\n\n203\n00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,540\nOpenStack, those guys they're\nproviding public clouds.\n\n204\n00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,760\nA server infrastructure with\ntens of thousands of servers\n\n205\n00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520\nthat are exposed to the Internet.\n\n206\n00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,150\nSo if I bring a web server up\nin Amazon EC2, well by default\n\n207\n00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,805\nit's got a public IP on the Internet, and\nif I open up port 80 on its firewall,\n\n208\n00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,705\nthe whole Internet can see that server and\nbrowse and get access to it, all right.\n\n209\n00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:11,635\nThat's a public cloud, and\nif you're gonna be running a website,\n\n210\n00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:15,195\nan email server, or something of that\nnature, you want it to be public.\n\n211\n00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,435\nBut there's also private clouds.\n\n212\n00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:24,630\nPrivate clouds are ones where you set up\nthe cloud in your own infrastructure.\n\n213\n00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,420\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I needed a cloud.\n\n214\n00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,370\nI want to be able to rapidly\nprovision servers and\n\n215\n00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,900\nall that good stuff that we\nhear about with these clouds.\n\n216\n00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,650\nI could go ahead and go and\nbuy 100 servers, and\n\n217\n00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,110\nI could set them up right\nhere behind the set.\n\n218\n00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,170\nI'll stick them behind this wall, right.\n\n219\n00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,519\nI'll just stack 100 servers and\nit'll get hot as heck in here.\n\n220\n00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,960\n[LAUGH] So we'll set up those 100 servers.\n\n221\n00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,550\nAnd now I can set it up with\ncloud software to be able to\n\n222\n00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,930\nrapidly provision machines,\nget that up and running.\n\n223\n00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,950\nI can do it.\n\n224\n00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,880\nIt's private because I control everything.\n\n225\n00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,400\nIt's my hardware, it's my operating\nsystem, it's my software,\n\n226\n00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,630\nI'm not really outsourcing anything,\nit's a private cloud completely here, but\n\n227\n00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,830\nthe negative is I've got to manage it.\n\n228\n00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,760\nI'm not getting all the advantages of\nusing some external cloud provider when\n\n229\n00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,280\nyou use, let's just use,\nwe used Amazon EC2 as an example.\n\n230\n00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,970\nThey're taking care of the hardware.\n\n231\n00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,810\nI manage the OS, I manage the software,\nbut they're taking care of the hardware.\n\n232\n00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,120\nWhen I say they're taking\ncare of the hardware,\n\n233\n00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,390\nthat means they buy the physical server,\nthey keep it under warranty.\n\n234\n00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,120\nIf a hard drive fails, they replace it.\n\n235\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,910\nIf power goes out,\nthey've got UPSes, generators,\n\n236\n00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,110\nthey've got the infrastructure\nto handle that.\n\n237\n00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,630\nThe server is in a physical rack that\nthey provide, the building is dated, you\n\n238\n00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,310\nhave to have biometric access to be able\nto get in, they take care of all that.\n\n239\n00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,100\nThat's all stuff that Amazon does, and\nthey pay the power bill every month.\n\n240\n00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,220\nAnd in exchange I just paid a simple\nmonthly fee which is a fraction of what\n\n241\n00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,550\nI'd have to pay myself because Amazon is\ndoing this tens of thousands of times,\n\n242\n00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,540\nI'm only doing it 100 times, right.\n\n243\n00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,620\nSo economies of scale, right.\n\n244\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,230\nThat's what happens with\nthose public clouds.\n\n245\n00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,220\nWith the private ones,\nyou pay the power bill,\n\n246\n00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,860\nyou set up the physical infrastructure,\nif a hard drive fails you replace it.\n\n247\n00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,120\nYou do all that maintenance.\n\n248\n00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,660\nSo, why would we do that?\n\n249\n00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,350\nControl, if I need\ncontrol of those servers,\n\n250\n00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,290\nif I need to guarantee a level of\nsecurity, that's why we do it, right.\n\n251\n00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,090\nIf we need that level of control,\nbut most people don't, and\n\n252\n00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,260\nthat's where you can really\ntake advantage of the cloud.\n\n253\n00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,030\nNow the best implementation in my opinion,\nis what's called a hybrid cloud, and\n\n254\n00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,140\na hybrid cloud is where you\ntake advantage of both.\n\n255\n00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,480\nYou have public resources\nin a public cloud and\n\n256\n00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,720\nprivate resources in a private cloud,\nand you can link the two together.\n\n257\n00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,030\nAnd there's a lot of neat products\nout there that let you do this.\n\n258\n00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,180\nI mentioned Rackspace's OpenStack,\nthat's one.\n\n259\n00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,590\nMicrosoft System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager, that's another.\n\n260\n00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,080\nWho else is in this space?\n\n261\n00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,634\nVMware, their, shoot what's their?\n\n262\n00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,303\n>> VSX?\n\n263\n00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,231\nNo.\n\n264\n00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,129\n>> It's a dedicated, vCenter Orchestrator.\n\n265\n00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,658\nvCenter Orchestrator, which actually, I\nthink it's name just changed to something\n\n266\n00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:58,200\nlike Envision Orchestrator or\nwhatever, Orchestrator is a product.\n\n267\n00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,830\nThese products let you create a private\ncloud, and link it to a public cloud,\n\n268\n00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,950\nand by doing that, you can have servers\nthat you move back and forth between them.\n\n269\n00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,210\nMaybe I've got a web server,\nI need to build a web server.\n\n270\n00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,750\nLet's use this as an example.\n\n271\n00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,040\nAnd so while I'm building it I\nwant to build it right here,\n\n272\n00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,100\nright in my own system,\ncuz it's not protected yet.\n\n273\n00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,410\nI've gotta configure it's firewall,\nset all it's permissions, so\n\n274\n00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,930\nI configure it here.\n\n275\n00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,720\nI get up and running, I test it.\n\n276\n00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,640\nEverything's working\nfine here in my building.\n\n277\n00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,770\nAnd then I go into Microsoft System\nCenter Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n278\n00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,310\nOr I go into my OpenStack\nmanagement portal.\n\n279\n00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,500\nAnd I say, take this machine and move it\nthis server up here in Microsoft Azure or\n\n280\n00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,280\nin Amazon EC2, and it moves it over there.\n\n281\n00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,800\nAnd now it's out there in the cloud.\n\n282\n00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,250\nIt's in the public cloud.\n\n283\n00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,040\nAnd, if I'm having some problems with\nthat server I might wanna yank it from\n\n284\n00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,170\nthe public cloud, and bring it down here,\nand put it back into my private cloud.\n\n285\n00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,750\nIt allows us to create a hybrid\nwhere we link the two together and\n\n286\n00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,020\nmost people use that for\ntransition, right.\n\n287\n00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,870\nI'm moving my company to the cloud,\nnot all at once, but\n\n288\n00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,570\npiece by piece and eventually\nit'll all be in the public cloud.\n\n289\n00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,730\nBut other people do use\nit on a permanent basis.\n\n290\n00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,220\nI've got some data, this is private, it's\ngotta stay here in the building with me\n\n291\n00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,750\nbut this other data can go out there and\nbe public.\n\n292\n00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,779\nNow, we get the best of both worlds.\n\n293\n00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,168\nAll right, so that's definitely something\nwe have to think about as we start to\n\n294\n00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,630\nimplement this, is exactly which of\nthe models that we're gonna be following.\n\n295\n00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,910\nNow, when people talk about going into\nthe cloud, one of the big things,\n\n296\n00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,030\none of the big fears that I always hear\nabout, is how it's gonna eliminate jobs.\n\n297\n00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,865\nIf I've got a company that has 20 IT\npeople on staff, and I go to the cloud,\n\n298\n00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:42,480\nI can fire all them, I just need one IT\nguy, you know somebody to go around and\n\n299\n00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,940\nmake sure the lights are on the morning\nand that's not really true.\n\n300\n00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,990\nEach job role inside of an IT department\nhas different ways they can take\n\n301\n00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,740\nadvantage of the cloud, and\nit's not so much eliminating a person,\n\n302\n00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,090\nI mean it may well be depends\non exactly what their role is.\n\n303\n00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,770\nSo for example, I mentioned if we use\nAmazon EC2 they host our servers.\n\n304\n00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,130\nWe spin our servers up there,\nthey take care of all the hardware.\n\n305\n00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,780\nSo if you have an employee\nwho just does hardware work.\n\n306\n00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,290\nThen yeah, they become somewhat\nredundant when you're in the cloud.\n\n307\n00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,970\nIf you have somebody whose\nsole job is to go around and\n\n308\n00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,980\nreplace failed hard drives, then well I\nguess there's really two things, right.\n\n309\n00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,200\nOne, that they need to update their skills\nto be able to do something more than\n\n310\n00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,860\nreplace hard drives.\n\n311\n00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,115\nAnd two,\nyou must have some really bad hard drives.\n\n312\n00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:30,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n313\n00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,470\nit's not common to have\nan employee like that.\n\n314\n00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,140\nBut with EC2,\nthey take care of the hardware.\n\n315\n00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,780\nYou still have to manage the OS.\n\n316\n00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,060\nYou still have to load the software.\n\n317\n00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,960\nYou still have to configure it.\n\n318\n00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,470\nYou treat it just like a server here in\nthe building with you, the only difference\n\n319\n00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,940\nis if a hard drive fails at 2:00 A.M.\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n320\n00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,400\nSomebody else does.\n\n321\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,357\nIf the power supply dies,\nif the Internet connection goes down,\n\n322\n00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:55,532\nwell in every Amazon region they've\ngot five Internet connections,\n\n323\n00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,142\nso if one goes down they just\nflip to one of the other ones.\n\n324\n00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:01,533\n>> You don't have to deal with it,\nthat's the nice thing about it.\n\n325\n00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:05,505\nAnd so if you do you have a job\nthat is solely responsible for\n\n326\n00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,950\ndoing hardware repair, then yes.\n\n327\n00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,641\nThe cloud is a threat.\n\n328\n00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,613\nAlthough I will say,\n\n329\n00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:13,070\nyou can get a job with the cloud providers\nbecause they need people like you.\n\n330\n00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,550\nAnd if you're Google and you have\na data center with 10,000 servers.\n\n331\n00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,270\nHow many hard drives do you\nthink you have fail a day?\n\n332\n00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,001\nHundreds.\n\n333\n00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:21,863\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can guarantee it.\n\n334\n00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:25,082\nHard drives fail, they do that and\na lot of them are going to SSDs now, so\n\n335\n00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:26,530\nthat rate starts to go down.\n\n336\n00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,080\nBut you guys get what I'm saying is,\nit's not that your job is eliminated.\n\n337\n00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,688\nIt might be eliminated with that company,\nbut\n\n338\n00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,342\nit's just it's moved to the company\nthat's providing the cloud service.\n\n339\n00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:35,251\nYeah, but the jobs are still there.\n\n340\n00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:39,155\n>> And your company still has things\nlike its own internet connectivity and\n\n341\n00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,227\nthe help desk and client computers and\nthings like that,\n\n342\n00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,731\nso it's not like there's\nnothing left to do.\n\n343\n00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,087\nAnd like Don said as well, you still\nhave to install operating systems,\n\n344\n00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,890\nconfigure them, do updates,\nthird party software.\n\n345\n00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,560\nThat's usually just not gonna fall into\nthe hands of them with EC2 Amazon,\n\n346\n00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,890\nit's gonna be your baby.\n\n347\n00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,026\n>> So if I'm a sys admin, so I'm\na systems administrator for my company,\n\n348\n00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:07,971\nthe way I can take advantage the cloud\nis by moving my servers up there for\n\n349\n00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:10,951\nincreased availability and redundancy.\n\n350\n00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:14,745\nI can have my servers up there in the\ncloud and know that if a hard drive fails,\n\n351\n00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,551\nif power fails,\nif the internet connection goes down.\n\n352\n00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:21,170\nIf any of those things happen,\nthe cloud provider takes care of it.\n\n353\n00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,910\nAnd they've got a team of some of\nthe highest paid network engineers and\n\n354\n00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,060\nsys admins in the world, cuz we're talking\nabout people with budgets way beyond ours.\n\n355\n00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,210\nWe can take advantage of that and\nit results in increased up time for\n\n356\n00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,360\nour end users and they appreciate that and\n\n357\n00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,590\nwe still manage the servers like\nnormal as far as software and so on.\n\n358\n00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,960\nIf I'm a developer I can really take\nadvantage of the cloud with a developer,\n\n359\n00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,160\nlet's say, I'm a PHP developer.\n\n360\n00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,180\nI can write PHP webpages like crazy.\n\n361\n00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,215\nI can do amazing shopping cart apps and\nstuff like that, but\n\n362\n00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,961\nI don't know the first thing\nabout server hardware.\n\n363\n00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,302\nI don't know the first thing\nabout Linux distributions or\n\n364\n00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,250\nMicrosoft Windows server or whatever.\n\n365\n00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,391\nI go PHP, I'm a developer, as an example.\n\n366\n00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:09,734\nI don't know anything about PHP,\nI know how to spell it.\n\n367\n00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,604\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So if I'm a developer like that\n\n368\n00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,186\nand I wanna write an application and\nI wanna test it or\n\n369\n00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:17,882\nI want to make it available to the public,\nI need to build some servers up and\n\n370\n00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,050\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n371\n00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,903\nBut with the cloud, I can go out and\nI can say, you know what?\n\n372\n00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,000\nJust give me a server that\nwill run my PHP application.\n\n373\n00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,471\nHere, let me show you\nguys an example in EC2.\n\n374\n00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,893\nIf I'm a developer and I wanna throw\nmy PHP app out there on the internet,\n\n375\n00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:37,604\nI can jump in my EC2 console, I go down\nto Elastic Beanstalk and I can tell it,\n\n376\n00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:42,330\nI need a launch up an all new\nenvironment to host my application.\n\n377\n00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,694\nI can come in here and\ntell it what I wanna whip up,\n\n378\n00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,001\nI wanna create a web server,\nif it's a PHP app, I need a web server.\n\n379\n00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,960\nAnd we just give it some kind of name,\n\n380\n00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,940\nI'll go with my default here leave\nthat be and I tell my platform.\n\n381\n00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,160\nI say, look I've got a PHP app or\nno JS or Python, Ruby whatever it is and\n\n382\n00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,481\nit's gonna fire up, all taught I want\nload balancing and auto scaling.\n\n383\n00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:07,216\nThat means is going to give\nme more than one server and\n\n384\n00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,205\nif my applications start to get busy,\n\n385\n00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:13,900\nit'll start cloning more servers to make\nit run faster and faster and faster.\n\n386\n00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,677\nAnd then when I'm not\nrunning with all users,\n\n387\n00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,239\nit'll prune off servers to make\nit smaller, smaller, smaller.\n\n388\n00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,342\nSo, it's gonna take care\nof all of that for me and\n\n389\n00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,230\nall I have to use upload\nmy application to it.\n\n390\n00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,291\nIt's right here on the next screen.\n\n391\n00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,850\nI come in and I tell it, I need to\nupload my application and send it along.\n\n392\n00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,360\nOr I can do a sample application, I guess.\n\n393\n00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,200\nI can throw that in there and I don't\nreally have to provide any other answers,\n\n394\n00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,092\nwe can kind of just click\nnext to the rest of this, but\n\n395\n00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,271\nwe just give it some names here.\n\n396\n00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,771\nWhat am I gonna name my application,\ngive it a description if we want and\n\n397\n00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:45,853\nthis name's actually\nalready taken I'm sure.\n\n398\n00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:51,610\nSo we'll call this my itprotv,\nwe'll just update that name a little bit.\n\n399\n00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,591\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,605\nAnd I can come through and\nprovide this application environment and\n\n401\n00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:59,740\nat the end of the day,\nit's gonna whip this up.\n\n402\n00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,209\nIt's gonna make it available\nout of the internet and\n\n403\n00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,970\nI don't know anything about\nthe hardware underneath it.\n\n404\n00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,092\nI don't know whether it's got\nIntel Xeon processors or AMDs,\n\n405\n00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:12,810\nI don't know if it's got SSD\nhard drives or whatever.\n\n406\n00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,911\nI could figure out, if I dug into\nall the stuff, but I don't have to.\n\n407\n00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,540\nI don't have to know all that information.\n\n408\n00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:24,271\nIt can sort all that out for me and at the\nend of the day, I can just be a developer.\n\n409\n00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,250\nI can write my applications and\nhost them up there and were done.\n\n410\n00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,471\nSo I'm gonna hit Launch,\nit's gonna fire that up and now I'm done.\n\n411\n00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,876\nIt's configuring a ton of stuff in\nthe back end that normally a sys admin\n\n412\n00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:36,401\nwould do.\n\n413\n00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,280\nI don't need that, I can just\nwhip this up, throw it in place.\n\n414\n00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,310\nNow that's great for\ntesting and even great for\n\n415\n00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,140\nthrowing out into production too.\n\n416\n00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,310\nBut eventually, as your app grows,\n\n417\n00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,260\nyou will need a better understanding\nof that underlying technology and\n\n418\n00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,000\nthat's where I want to reach out to sys\nadmins or other people like that to help.\n\n419\n00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,195\nBut if you are just a developer by\nyourself you're like a single developer\n\n420\n00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,761\nand you don't have a team.\n\n421\n00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,580\nWell, this is a great way to get things\nimplemented that you wouldn't normally\n\n422\n00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,840\nhave the resources to do.\n\n423\n00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,271\n>> And what if I'm in management?\n\n424\n00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,740\nIs the cloud even pertinent to me,\nas well?\n\n425\n00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,911\n>> This is where a lot of\ncloud pressure comes from.\n\n426\n00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:13,579\nIT guys as kind of a general rule, once a\ntechnology is implemented, they kinda like\n\n427\n00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:18,278\nto just sit back and let it run if there's\nno problems, don't don't rock the boat.\n\n428\n00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,690\nBut CIOs as chief information officer,\nthey read a magazine, they read Forbes\n\n429\n00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,910\nreports, Gartner reports and they say\nin there companies can save money.\n\n430\n00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,627\nCompanies can have better up time,\ncompanies can have better stability and\n\n431\n00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:36,071\ngrowth rates and all of these great\nthings if they leverage the cloud.\n\n432\n00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,051\nAnd so what's the CIO gonna do?\n\n433\n00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,131\nThey're gonna look at it and\nsay, well, we need this.\n\n434\n00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:43,129\nSo they're usually the ones pushing this\nforward to making companies go to it and\n\n435\n00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:45,760\nit's good thing, there's so\nmany advantages.\n\n436\n00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,832\nAt a minimum just your bottom line,\nyour financial dollars,\n\n437\n00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:54,390\nyour your IT budget can be significantly\nreduced by using the cloud.\n\n438\n00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,696\nAn example would be,\nif I wanted to buy a physical server,\n\n439\n00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,480\nso that web app I was just talking about.\n\n440\n00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,608\nIf I was to deploy a web app like that,\n\n441\n00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:05,581\nI would use usually like\na standard one use server.\n\n442\n00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:10,650\nSo we might go somewhere like Dell and\ngo, we'll shop their servers real quick.\n\n443\n00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,582\nSo if I wanna get a standard\none use server from Dell,\n\n444\n00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,791\nit's normally gonna be in between 5 and\n$7,000.\n\n445\n00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,356\nSo let's find one with 4 cores and\n\n446\n00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:24,880\nabout 8 gigs of RAM is probably a pretty\nstandard web server, I think it.\n\n447\n00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,520\nWe'll go low end here.\n\n448\n00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,601\nOh, not that low end.\n\n449\n00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:30,103\n[LAUGH] We'll go this low\nend like a rack mount.\n\n450\n00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,543\n>> We want this to actually work.\n\n451\n00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:32,807\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n452\n00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:35,511\nhere's like a one use server, this R220.\n\n453\n00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:40,191\nIt's not a terribly big server and you'll\nsee the price actually starts pretty low,\n\n454\n00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:44,546\nbut where things change when we start\nadding stuff to it, like redundant CPUs,\n\n455\n00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:47,160\nadditional hard drives, additional memory.\n\n456\n00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,330\nAnd in fact,\nI think this one is a short depth chassis.\n\n457\n00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,630\nI think it's only got one power supply,\nso let's go up to the next level here.\n\n458\n00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,566\nJust wanna make sure I get an Apples to\nApples to what Amazon or Microsoft Azure,\n\n459\n00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,800\nwhat they're using, so\n\n460\n00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,821\nthey're using something a little\nmore comparable to this.\n\n461\n00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:08,351\nSo here's a system it's got a Xeon\nprocessor in it, so it's going to 4 cores,\n\n462\n00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,361\n8 gigs of memory and yeah,\nthis one's only about 1,200 bucks.\n\n463\n00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,960\nWell, that's the price as we look at\nit right here just kind of written\n\n464\n00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,840\non the site $1,200, but\nwhat does that include?\n\n465\n00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,491\nDoes that include my\noperating system license?\n\n466\n00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,700\nDoes that include\nredundant power supplies?\n\n467\n00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,676\nDoes that include the warranty and\nthe other things that I need?\n\n468\n00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,325\nAnd by the time we get\nthese things priced out,\n\n469\n00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,235\nthey end up being a little\nbit more expensive.\n\n470\n00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,566\nLooks like I caught it on sale.\n\n471\n00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,545\nToday's a good day to buy a server.\n\n472\n00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,514\nSo when we start to dial down each of\nthe different options in here with what we\n\n473\n00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:40,005\nwanna add,\nthey seem a little more expensive.\n\n474\n00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:43,636\nSo it looks like right now,\nit is setup for a couple of hard drives.\n\n475\n00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,625\nSo it's got a four core processor in it,\nwhich is good.\n\n476\n00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,841\nWe've got basic memory is fine.\n\n477\n00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:52,230\nI'm not gonna mess around\nwith that too much and\n\n478\n00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,062\nthey're going a little cheap on the 2,\n4 gigs, but we'll leave that be.\n\n479\n00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:57,683\nNo operating system on this one.\n\n480\n00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,543\nSo I am going to need\nan operating system and\n\n481\n00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:03,318\nlet's say that I'm running Windows as Dell\nrecommended so I'll choose Windows, and\n\n482\n00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,197\nnotice my price starts\nto kind of creep up.\n\n483\n00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:08,909\nAnd then as we keep going down it\nhasn't asked about hard drives yet,\n\n484\n00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,770\nsomewhere in here,\nhere we go, hard drives.\n\n485\n00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,560\nSo, I got an error with\nthe operating system.\n\n486\n00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,525\nI need a media kit guess.\n\n487\n00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,889\nBut I need to pick a hard drive so\nwe'll do like software RAID one,\n\n488\n00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:23,866\nthat's a mirrored set of hard drives and\nso that means I'm going to need a RAID\n\n489\n00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:27,191\ncontroller, so we'll pick\nthe middle level RAID controller.\n\n490\n00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:30,092\nAnd we'll need at least two hard\ndrives if we're going to do a mirror.\n\n491\n00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:32,640\nSo, it comes with a 500 gig and\n\n492\n00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,920\nis there not an option to\npick a second 500 gig drive?\n\n493\n00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,497\nWell, you know what?\n\n494\n00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:40,620\nWe'll leave that data in for right now.\n\n495\n00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,646\nBasic management is fine, and\n\n496\n00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:47,438\nyou know what, I won't mess with\nany of these other options too.\n\n497\n00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,462\nAnd these are like,\nadditional network adapters and stuff.\n\n498\n00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:51,770\nI don't want to get too crazy with that.\n\n499\n00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,370\nIt does only have a single power supply\nthough so I want to go dual hot plug.\n\n500\n00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,630\nWe'll bump up to that, and man, I am\njust getting all sorts of errors here.\n\n501\n00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,800\nSee, this is the other challenge.\n\n502\n00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,610\nIf I want to go with a physical server,\nI gotta get it specced out, and\n\n503\n00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,150\nI've got to hunt through all\nthe different requirements\n\n504\n00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,340\nto kind of sort out what we need.\n\n505\n00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,590\nIt's telling me I need a perc S10,\nwhich I thought I had picked.\n\n506\n00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,810\nI guess I picked the wrong one.\n\n507\n00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,776\n>> Don, you can probably have\nthe server spinned up by now on EC2.\n\n508\n00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:22,086\n[LAUGH]\n>> I certainly could have.\n\n509\n00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,570\nSo we have to go through and\nspec this stuff out.\n\n510\n00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,880\nOnce it's done we get a price.\n\n511\n00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,010\nRight, now I'm going to stop right here.\n\n512\n00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,180\nIt's actually gonna be a little\nbit more expensive, but\n\n513\n00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,166\nlet's just run with this, $2168.\n\n514\n00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,290\nI didn't get to the warranty.\n\n515\n00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,337\nAnd I know the warranty is going to\nadd on to that price a good bit,\n\n516\n00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,720\nif I can even find that here in my screen.\n\n517\n00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440\nI guess it's on the next page.\n\n518\n00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,320\nSo, this is going to go up.\n\n519\n00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,110\nNow that warranty cost isn't a one\ntime thing, so year after year,\n\n520\n00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,310\nI'm going to have to pay that,\nor I can stretch it out.\n\n521\n00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,750\nIt looks like it comes with three year\nbasic but if I wanna compare to what\n\n522\n00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,260\nAmazon or Microsoft has, they're going\nto have parts for our response time.\n\n523\n00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,650\nThey're going to have rapid flip\noverrun on this kind of stuff.\n\n524\n00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,140\nSo I would need to bump\nthis little warranty up.\n\n525\n00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,508\nSo like this five by ten hardware only\nwe'd really have to go to like Pro Support\n\n526\n00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,869\nto reflect what we're\ngetting with those providers.\n\n527\n00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,634\nSo now we're at 2,860, almost $3,000.\n\n528\n00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:15,634\nAnd that's not counting the time it's\ngoing to take me to install the server in\n\n529\n00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:21,109\nthe rack to supply a power for 24 hours a\nday, 7 days a week, all year long, right.\n\n530\n00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:25,294\nThe power cost, the air conditioning\ncosts, UPS and battery backup,\n\n531\n00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,270\ngenerators if I need that.\n\n532\n00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,800\nAll of the other incidentals that\nmake this server twice, three times,\n\n533\n00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,470\nfour times that much expensive\nthe price that we see right here.\n\n534\n00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,050\nBut with Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure,\n\n535\n00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,830\nlet's use Amazon cuz their\npricing is easier to find.\n\n536\n00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,540\nWhen we use their systems and we look at\ntheir pricing we just come in here, and\n\n537\n00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,120\nwe say, look, I need a server.\n\n538\n00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,900\nLet's pick a Windows server so\nthat it's apples to apples here.\n\n539\n00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,280\nLet's do a on demand server.\n\n540\n00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,670\nWe'll go Windows, and\nI'll come in here and\n\n541\n00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,390\nI'll pick a four CPU, one with\neight gigs of RAM is what I wanted.\n\n542\n00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,080\nLooks like I might have to step up a bit\nto find one that's exactly what I want.\n\n543\n00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,580\nAnd, maybe they don't have a four and\neight, so\n\n544\n00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,550\nI might have to go a little bit higher.\n\n545\n00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,590\nWe'll go 4 and 13 like this guy.\n\n546\n00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,780\nNotice how they charge,\nme over here it's $0.53 per hour.\n\n547\n00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,100\nThey're charging me a per hour basis.\n\n548\n00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,240\nNow if I work that out with\na good ole calculator and\n\n549\n00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,663\nI say it's $0.53 per hour and\nthere's 24 hours in a day and\n\n550\n00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:34,215\nthere's 365 days in a year, that's $4642.\n\n551\n00:27:34,215 --> 00:27:37,852\nNow, the server I specced that\nwith Dell was $2800-something.\n\n552\n00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:40,922\nIt would really be more, but\nlet's just go with that 2800 number.\n\n553\n00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:44,379\nThis 4000 is including power, generators,\n\n554\n00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:49,730\nall those other different things\nto keep the server up and running.\n\n555\n00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,710\nThat 28.60 from Dell didn't include any of\nthat and I can guarantee you they work out\n\n556\n00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,240\nto at least be the same even\nif it was a break even.\n\n557\n00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,590\nYou're still getting the advantage of\nAmazon is going to completely manage that\n\n558\n00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,890\nif a hard drive fails they\ndeal with it for me right.\n\n559\n00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,080\nThat's the big advantage, and so for\n\n560\n00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,140\na CIO to look at this stuff\nit's going to cost them less.\n\n561\n00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,530\nThey're going to get a faster\nresponse time on repairs.\n\n562\n00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,850\nThey're going to get a better\nservice level agreement.\n\n563\n00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,750\nThey're going to get redundant\nInternet connections.\n\n564\n00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,660\nAll those other things that make\ntheir IT department more stable and\n\n565\n00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,750\na better experience for the end user.\n\n566\n00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,960\nAnd that's how a CIO benefits from this.\n\n567\n00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,710\nSo, sys admins, developers, CIOs.\n\n568\n00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,290\nThey all benefit from implementing\na technology like the cloud.\n\n569\n00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,820\nAnd that really all goes back to\nsomething we call risk deference, right?\n\n570\n00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,140\nThere's a lot of risk when you\nimplement your own servers,\n\n571\n00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,910\nthings that can go wrong,\nupdates that can get missed.\n\n572\n00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,710\nAnd with the cloud, you're pushing\nthat off on another company.\n\n573\n00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,470\nYou're saying I'm gonna let Amazon assume\nthat risk, I'm gonna transfer that risk\n\n574\n00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,400\nover to them, it's now their problem\nas opposed to being my problem.\n\n575\n00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,790\nAnd CIOs like that kind of stuff.\n\n576\n00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,320\n>> Yes they do, yes they do.\n\n577\n00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,430\nAnd not only that, but\nyou can easily upscale that provisioning.\n\n578\n00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,820\nIf I need more hardware,\nboom, we go right into it.\n\n579\n00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,830\nI just rock into Amazon's login there,\nadd more RAM, add more CPU,\n\n580\n00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,410\nwhatever I need, and even do other things\nthat are really awesome where it'll,\n\n581\n00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,750\nyou can say, I need more at these times,\nadd to that stuff, and\n\n582\n00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,300\nthen when I don't need it, takes it away,\nkeeps that scalable economy right there.\n\n583\n00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,360\nVery economical.\n\n584\n00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,670\n>> Yeah, and\nif I had ordered that server from Dell,\n\n585\n00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,310\nI think you guys might have saw where it\nsaid delivery time, five or seven days.\n\n586\n00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,810\nSo I'd be lucky to have it in a week and\nthen get set up and get it going.\n\n587\n00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,710\nWith Microsoft Azure or Rackspace or\nwhoever I'll have the server in minutes.\n\n588\n00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,300\nIt will be up and running and ready for\nme to start working with it very,\n\n589\n00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,770\nvery quickly and if I don't need anymore\nI can shut it down and I stop paying for\n\n590\n00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,240\nit, versus that physical server.\n\n591\n00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,340\nIf I shut down,\nI've already paid for it right?\n\n592\n00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,915\nAnd don't worry about Dell.\n\n593\n00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:47,715\nSome people are probably thinking right\nnow, oh, Dell's gonna go out of business.\n\n594\n00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:51,425\nThey're gonna do fine, because when you\nwalk into the big, giant data centers with\n\n595\n00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:53,665\ntens of thousands of servers who do you\nthink they're buying them from, right?\n\n596\n00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,685\nSo they're just selling them to\na different kind of client than us.\n\n597\n00:29:56,685 --> 00:30:01,995\nAnd that's where the cloud really\nstarts to come in handy, cuz Microsoft,\n\n598\n00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:04,915\nRackspace, those guys, they'll buy tens\nof thousands of servers so we get them\n\n599\n00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:08,980\ncheaper than when we buy 5 servers or\neven 50 servers for that matter.\n\n600\n00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,690\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n601\n00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,018\nWell, Don, have we, I mean I think this\nis a good generalization, overview.\n\n602\n00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:17,473\nKind of take away some of the mystic\nmystical things around the cloud that's\n\n603\n00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:18,735\nhovering around it.\n\n604\n00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,880\nA lot people get a little\nconfused by this.\n\n605\n00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,650\nI think we've done a really good job\ntoday of hopefully demystifying that.\n\n606\n00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,695\n>> Absolutely and we intentionally\nkept this one pretty general.\n\n607\n00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,014\nSo if you thinking,\nman these guys didn't cover any details,\n\n608\n00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:32,110\nwhat kind of garbage was this?\n\n609\n00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,805\nI feel you.\n\n610\n00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:38,310\n[LAUGH] But stay tuned
