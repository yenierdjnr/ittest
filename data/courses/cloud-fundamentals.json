  "description": "The Cloud Fundamentals video series is designed to introduce the viewer to cloud computing, which works from providers that can have thousands of servers and have more than enough hardware and CPU resources to support their systems and they rent out the extra capacity to users so the potential is not wasted. Positions like system administrators, developers and CIOs all benefit from implementing cloud technology. Cloud concepts and theory are discussed and then actual deployment examples of practical applications are demonstrated using Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.",

another\ngreat episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,360\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,420\nHere with me today is none\nother than Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,770\nHow you doing today Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,800\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,900\nAnd you know I'm excited to\nkick off a new series here on\n\n9\n00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,060\nITProTV our Cloud Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,935\nThis is going to be a series of episodes\nall tailored to introducing you\n\n11\n00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:35,088\nthe viewer, to the cloud which is like\nthe most nebulous term in the world.\n\n12\n00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,336\nWell, I guess nebula's are clouds I\ndon't know how that works out, or not.\n\n13\n00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,885\nBut it's a buzz word that\ngets thrown around a lot.\n\n14\n00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:41,715\nA lot a lot of people don't really\nrealize what's going on with it.\n\n15\n00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:45,005\nSo we're gonna decipher the mystery and\nkind of thin that out.\n\n16\n00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,295\nWe're going to start off with a few\nepisodes that are just going to detail\n\n17\n00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,530\ncloud concepts.\n\n18\n00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,990\nAnd then we're going to follow off\nwith some real world examples.\n\n19\n00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,170\nShow you how to implement cloud\ntechnologies, how to make use of them.\n\n20\n00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,240\nWe'll get some chances to see, like,\nAmazon EC2, and Microsoft Azure, and\n\n21\n00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840\nthose guys in action.\n\n22\n00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,020\nBut before we dive into all that,\nlet's just start with the basics.\n\n23\n00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,410\nWhat is the cloud?\n\n24\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,790\nNow, if somebody comes to you and\nsays, hey,\n\n25\n00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,840\nI need to get my stuff in the cloud,\nthey could mean several different things.\n\n26\n00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,970\nSo let's back it all the way back up\nto where this technology came from,\n\n27\n00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,100\nback in the 1970s.\n\n28\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,280\nThat's right, we're gonna go,\nwe're going old school.\n\n29\n00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,415\nSo back 40 years ago.\n\n30\n00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,635\nWe started to see virtualize\ncomputing infrastructure.\n\n31\n00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:30,065\nHe's on a mainframe mostly like the old\nVAC systems and things like that.\n\n32\n00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,885\nThey had virtualization in them.\n\n33\n00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:36,535\nAnd then the technology kind of died off\nin the late 80s and then in the late 90s,\n\n34\n00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:38,835\nit started to come back again.\n\n35\n00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:42,825\nAnd we started seeing this\nvirtualization movement kick in, and\n\n36\n00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,880\nit's what really led to the cloud.\n\n37\n00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,550\nSo virtualization is really the heart of\nthis and if you don't know what that is.\n\n38\n00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,570\nWell virtualization is probably one of the\ncoolest technologies to be implemented on\n\n39\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,040\nmodern networks.\n\n40\n00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,910\nWhat it is, the way I always describe it,\nis it's kind of like car pooling for\n\n41\n00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,290\ncomputers, right?\n\n42\n00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,800\nIf you think about your car.\n\n43\n00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,858\nI drove to the studio this morning\nin a car that has five seats in it,\n\n44\n00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,750\nand I was the only person in it.\n\n45\n00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,390\nSo that meant I had four seats in my car\nthat were empty that I could've used,\n\n46\n00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,320\nbut I waste it.\n\n47\n00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,760\nSo I really only use 20% of\nthe potential of my vehicle,\n\n48\n00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,730\nas far as moving people\nfrom one place to another.\n\n49\n00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,830\nWell that's where your computer is.\n\n50\n00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,780\nI've got a laptop sitting\nhere in front of me.\n\n51\n00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,760\nIt's got 16 gigs of RAM in it.\n\n52\n00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,650\nI'm probably using two\ngigs of ram right now.\n\n53\n00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,050\nThe other memory just wasted.\n\n54\n00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,600\nCPU, I don't really know.\n\n55\n00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000\nI think I've got a quad-core processor.\n\n56\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120\nShow's what I know.\n\n57\n00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,070\nSo I'm probably using one CPU, and\nbarely a percent is that right now.\n\n58\n00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,980\nThe rest of it is being wasted.\n\n59\n00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,170\nThat's how our computers are.\n\n60\n00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,570\nWe waste a lot of resources,\nbut we want them\n\n61\n00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,670\nbecause there will come a time when\nI need it, where I need that memory.\n\n62\n00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,910\nI need that CPU, and I need it to be here.\n\n63\n00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,130\nSo, I have it, and\nI just waste what's extra.\n\n64\n00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,633\nWith virtualization what we do, is we\ntake more than one operating system and\n\n65\n00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,420\nwe run it on the same computer.\n\n66\n00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,220\nWe run it on the same hardware.\n\n67\n00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,690\nAnd now, you know, I might only\nbe using two gigs of memory, but\n\n68\n00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,110\nI've got another operating system\nthat's using two more gigs.\n\n69\n00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,150\nAnd a third operating system\nthat's using two more.\n\n70\n00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,930\nAnd between the three of us\nwe're all using six gigs of RAM.\n\n71\n00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,830\nNow we're actually starting to use\nthe hardware that's available to us,\n\n72\n00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,780\nwe're starting to get our money's worth.\n\n73\n00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,900\nAnd that's the principle\nbehind virtualization.\n\n74\n00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500\nThat's where products like VMWare,\nvSphere and\n\n75\n00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,510\nMicrosoft HyperV, Citrix Zen Server,\nKVM, all those other different software\n\n76\n00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,850\nvirtualization products that are out\nthere, and their hardware counterparts.\n\n77\n00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,480\nAll of that works on the simple\nprinciple of carpooling for servers.\n\n78\n00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,150\nWell, once that started to catch on,\nand remember,\n\n79\n00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,120\nthis really came about in the 1970s.\n\n80\n00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,870\nBut it wasn't until the late 90s that\nVMWare really pushed into businesses.\n\n81\n00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,430\nAnd we're to a point now in the year 2015,\nwhere If you're a business and\n\n82\n00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,480\nyou don't have virtualization of one form\nor another, you're behind the curve.\n\n83\n00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,340\nEverybody's pretty much implement\nthis in one form or another.\n\n84\n00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,300\nWell, providers like Amazon, Microsoft.\n\n85\n00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,060\nThese companies that are huge, that tens\nof thousands of servers around the world.\n\n86\n00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,800\nGoogle, Rackspace these guys have tons\nof hardware to support their systems.\n\n87\n00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,570\nAnd it's more than they need.\n\n88\n00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,100\nAnd so what do they do with\nthe extra stuff goes to waste?\n\n89\n00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,570\nWell used to,\n\n90\n00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,030\nnow thanks to virtualization they can\nrent out their extra space to customers.\n\n91\n00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,190\nIf you need a server with a certain amount\nof memory, instead of building yourself\n\n92\n00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,825\nyou can just go rent it from Microsoft's\nleftovers, or Amazon's leftovers.\n\n93\n00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,220\nBecause they got a ton, right?\n\n94\n00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,990\nTens of thousands of us around the globe.\n\n95\n00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,290\nGoogle, they probably\nhave the most of anybody.\n\n96\n00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,300\nThey've got reserves, they've got extra\nCPU, extra memory laying around, and\n\n97\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,000\nI don't mean like chips laying on a shelf.\n\n98\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,025\nAlthough they they do that too.\n\n99\n00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I mean,\n\n100\n00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,660\nactive servers that are running,\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n101\n00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,470\nThat just aren't being used to\nthey're fullest utilization.\n\n102\n00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,640\nAnd we can take advantage of that.\n\n103\n00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,820\nAnd that is the cloud.\n\n104\n00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,470\nIt's using these servers.\n\n105\n00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,530\nThese things that\nare connected to the internet.\n\n106\n00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,600\nThey just aren't being used right now.\n\n107\n00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,130\nIt's just kind of available and\nbeing wasted.\n\n108\n00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,210\nSo you can thank technologies\nlike VMware ESX server.\n\n109\n00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,500\nOr Microsoft's Hyper V.\n\n110\n00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,510\nOr Virtual Box, or any of\nthe virtualization products out there.\n\n111\n00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,700\nFor leading to what we all\nthink of today as a cloud.\n\n112\n00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200\n>> And it's very convenient too.\n\n113\n00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,710\nI love virtualization, to be able to run\nmobile operating systems on my laptop,\n\n114\n00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,340\nkind of like Don was talking about.\n\n115\n00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,000\nBut the cost of it is so\nmuch more economical than me going, well,\n\n116\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,030\nI need another server, or\nI need another, even a desktop system.\n\n117\n00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,910\nI don't have to actually buy that system.\n\n118\n00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,730\nI can say hey I can use one\nof these cloud technologies.\n\n119\n00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,820\nI can go to Amazon.\n\n120\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,350\nI can go to Microsoft Azure and\nuse some of that.\n\n121\n00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,450\nAnd let them foot the bill, and\ntake care of all that stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,220\nI just need the server to run.\n\n123\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,140\nMakes it really simple for me.\n\n124\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,890\n>> Now where it gets confusing is,\n\n125\n00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,170\nwhen you decide to implement\na technology in the cloud.\n\n126\n00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,050\nYou have different layers, different\nlevels that you can kind of buy in.\n\n127\n00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,440\nIt's like a poker game.\n\n128\n00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,780\nYou can you can bet a little bit, or\n\n129\n00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,280\nyou can go all in and\nput all your chips into that bet.\n\n130\n00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,450\nWell that's how the cloud is.\n\n131\n00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,130\nSo when you reach out and you start\nto reserve these cloud resources.\n\n132\n00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,800\nIt's up to you how far in you want to go,\nall right?\n\n133\n00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560\nSome people just tab their\ntoe in a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,010\nThey rent that server hardware.\n\n135\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,560\nThey go to Amazon EC2 or\nthey go to Microsoft Azure, and\n\n136\n00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,700\nthey rent CPU and memory.\n\n137\n00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500\nAnd they put their\noperating system on there.\n\n138\n00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,910\nThey put their software on there.\n\n139\n00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,660\nThey manage it just like they would\na server in their own environment.\n\n140\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,140\nBut the hardware is what's\nout there in the cloud.\n\n141\n00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,360\nAnd they're renting that from that\nprovider whoever that happens to be,\n\n142\n00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120\nto get the access to that system.\n\n143\n00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,670\nNow that's one way to go about it.\n\n144\n00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,260\nAnd the nice part there is the hardware\nis completely handled by that vendor.\n\n145\n00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,630\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n146\n00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,980\nYou manage everything\nelse as far as the OS.\n\n147\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,800\nJust like you would a server\nsitting right next to you.\n\n148\n00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,940\nSo it's easy to implement that way, and\n\n149\n00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,330\nyou start to take advantage of some\nof what the cloud has to offer.\n\n150\n00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,280\nThen we can go a step further.\n\n151\n00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760\nAnd we can say, well you know what,\nthey're managing our hardware.\n\n152\n00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,710\nWouldn't it be nice if they\nmanaged the operating system too?\n\n153\n00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,090\nAnd now they can manage the hardware and\nthe operating system, and\n\n154\n00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,810\nwe just throw our software on top.\n\n155\n00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,840\nAnd now we just have to\nkeep track of our software.\n\n156\n00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,290\nThat's a little bit further\ninto the cloud, right?\n\n157\n00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,810\nNow you're starting to kind of eliminate\n\n158\n00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,360\nyour ability to control certain\nareas as far as hardware and the OS.\n\n159\n00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,940\nAnd then there's going all in.\n\n160\n00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,480\nAnd going all in,\nthat's where you say, you know what?\n\n161\n00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,010\nI want this provider out there on\nthe cloud to take care of the hardware,\n\n162\n00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,300\nthe operating system, the software,\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n163\n00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,480\nI just wanna use my programs.\n\n164\n00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,130\nAnd that's really where\nmost of our consumers are.\n\n165\n00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,130\nAnd most of you guys who are watching\nthe show are probably doing this.\n\n166\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,170\nIf you if you use web based email, like I\nuse Gmail for some of my personal email.\n\n167\n00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,586\nAnd with Google, they provide the servers,\nthey provide the OS,\n\n168\n00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,052\nthey provide the software.\n\n169\n00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,420\nI just log into a web page and\nthere's my email.\n\n170\n00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,541\nI didn't configure anything.\n\n171\n00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:58,766\nOn one hand, I get super easy to use\nemail that is on world class servers and\n\n172\n00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:04,610\nworld class data centers,\nit's really more than I could do myself.\n\n173\n00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,300\nOn the other hand,\nI have zero control of that server.\n\n174\n00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,750\nIf I say, boy,\nI really wish they offered S/MIME support.\n\n175\n00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,868\nWell, they don't, and\nthere's nothing I can do about that.\n\n176\n00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:20,110\nIn fact, there's no real way to contact\nGoogle to even ask them, right.\n\n177\n00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,140\nSo you're really leaving it up to\nthem to control those features and\n\n178\n00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,980\nso on,\nwe're just not able to deal with that.\n\n179\n00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,290\nSo that's one of the challenges\nthat you bump into.\n\n180\n00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,640\nIf you need a lot of control, going\nfull cloud is not necessarily an option.\n\n181\n00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,220\nYou might have to go with\none of the smaller options.\n\n182\n00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,810\nSo that's something we\nneed to be aware of,\n\n183\n00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,380\nis that there are different levels of\nbuy in when it comes to using the cloud.\n\n184\n00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,760\n>> Now Don, is there necessarily a right\nor wrong implementation of the cloud, or\n\n185\n00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,410\nit's just whatever's curtailed to your-\n>> According to the trade magazines,\n\n186\n00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,114\nthey're all right.\n\n187\n00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,473\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You should be using the cloud!\n\n188\n00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:58,880\nI think that it's not so much about being\nwrong as it is being sub-optimal, right.\n\n189\n00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,280\nThat there's some people that have certain\nneeds, and when you go into the cloud,\n\n190\n00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,210\nyou might not be taking advantage\nof all that the cloud has to offer.\n\n191\n00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,350\nOr maybe you're taking into too much,\nand now you've put yourself at risk.\n\n192\n00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,420\nLike if your company handles\nfinancial records or medical records,\n\n193\n00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,950\nyou might put too much data into the cloud\nand then the cloud gets compromised.\n\n194\n00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,190\nAnd now those records are out and\nyou have a debacle.\n\n195\n00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,090\nYou should have maintained more control so\nyou can encrypt your data and\n\n196\n00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,180\nguarantee security.\n\n197\n00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,370\nSo you do have to be careful\nabout things like that.\n\n198\n00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,030\nBut it's not so much about right or\n\n199\n00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,540\nwrong as it is just making sure\nthat you take proper precautions.\n\n200\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,430\nSo, all right, now when we go into\nthe cloud what most people think of\n\n201\n00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,420\nas the cloud is is what's actually\ncalled the public cloud, all right.\n\n202\n00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,000\nAmazon's Web services,\nMicrosoft Azure, Rackspace,\n\n203\n00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,540\nOpenStack, those guys they're\nproviding public clouds.\n\n204\n00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,760\nA server infrastructure with\ntens of thousands of servers\n\n205\n00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520\nthat are exposed to the Internet.\n\n206\n00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,150\nSo if I bring a web server up\nin Amazon EC2, well by default\n\n207\n00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,805\nit's got a public IP on the Internet, and\nif I open up port 80 on its firewall,\n\n208\n00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,705\nthe whole Internet can see that server and\nbrowse and get access to it, all right.\n\n209\n00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:11,635\nThat's a public cloud, and\nif you're gonna be running a website,\n\n210\n00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:15,195\nan email server, or something of that\nnature, you want it to be public.\n\n211\n00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,435\nBut there's also private clouds.\n\n212\n00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:24,630\nPrivate clouds are ones where you set up\nthe cloud in your own infrastructure.\n\n213\n00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,420\nSo for example,\nlet's say that I needed a cloud.\n\n214\n00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,370\nI want to be able to rapidly\nprovision servers and\n\n215\n00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,900\nall that good stuff that we\nhear about with these clouds.\n\n216\n00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,650\nI could go ahead and go and\nbuy 100 servers, and\n\n217\n00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,110\nI could set them up right\nhere behind the set.\n\n218\n00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,170\nI'll stick them behind this wall, right.\n\n219\n00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,519\nI'll just stack 100 servers and\nit'll get hot as heck in here.\n\n220\n00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,960\n[LAUGH] So we'll set up those 100 servers.\n\n221\n00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,550\nAnd now I can set it up with\ncloud software to be able to\n\n222\n00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,930\nrapidly provision machines,\nget that up and running.\n\n223\n00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,950\nI can do it.\n\n224\n00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,880\nIt's private because I control everything.\n\n225\n00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,400\nIt's my hardware, it's my operating\nsystem, it's my software,\n\n226\n00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,630\nI'm not really outsourcing anything,\nit's a private cloud completely here, but\n\n227\n00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,830\nthe negative is I've got to manage it.\n\n228\n00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,760\nI'm not getting all the advantages of\nusing some external cloud provider when\n\n229\n00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,280\nyou use, let's just use,\nwe used Amazon EC2 as an example.\n\n230\n00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,970\nThey're taking care of the hardware.\n\n231\n00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,810\nI manage the OS, I manage the software,\nbut they're taking care of the hardware.\n\n232\n00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,120\nWhen I say they're taking\ncare of the hardware,\n\n233\n00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,390\nthat means they buy the physical server,\nthey keep it under warranty.\n\n234\n00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,120\nIf a hard drive fails, they replace it.\n\n235\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,910\nIf power goes out,\nthey've got UPSes, generators,\n\n236\n00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,110\nthey've got the infrastructure\nto handle that.\n\n237\n00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,630\nThe server is in a physical rack that\nthey provide, the building is dated, you\n\n238\n00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,310\nhave to have biometric access to be able\nto get in, they take care of all that.\n\n239\n00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,100\nThat's all stuff that Amazon does, and\nthey pay the power bill every month.\n\n240\n00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,220\nAnd in exchange I just paid a simple\nmonthly fee which is a fraction of what\n\n241\n00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,550\nI'd have to pay myself because Amazon is\ndoing this tens of thousands of times,\n\n242\n00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,540\nI'm only doing it 100 times, right.\n\n243\n00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,620\nSo economies of scale, right.\n\n244\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,230\nThat's what happens with\nthose public clouds.\n\n245\n00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,220\nWith the private ones,\nyou pay the power bill,\n\n246\n00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,860\nyou set up the physical infrastructure,\nif a hard drive fails you replace it.\n\n247\n00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,120\nYou do all that maintenance.\n\n248\n00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,660\nSo, why would we do that?\n\n249\n00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,350\nControl, if I need\ncontrol of those servers,\n\n250\n00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,290\nif I need to guarantee a level of\nsecurity, that's why we do it, right.\n\n251\n00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,090\nIf we need that level of control,\nbut most people don't, and\n\n252\n00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,260\nthat's where you can really\ntake advantage of the cloud.\n\n253\n00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,030\nNow the best implementation in my opinion,\nis what's called a hybrid cloud, and\n\n254\n00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,140\na hybrid cloud is where you\ntake advantage of both.\n\n255\n00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,480\nYou have public resources\nin a public cloud and\n\n256\n00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,720\nprivate resources in a private cloud,\nand you can link the two together.\n\n257\n00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,030\nAnd there's a lot of neat products\nout there that let you do this.\n\n258\n00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,180\nI mentioned Rackspace's OpenStack,\nthat's one.\n\n259\n00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,590\nMicrosoft System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager, that's another.\n\n260\n00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,080\nWho else is in this space?\n\n261\n00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,634\nVMware, their, shoot what's their?\n\n262\n00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,303\n>> VSX?\n\n263\n00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,231\nNo.\n\n264\n00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,129\n>> It's a dedicated, vCenter Orchestrator.\n\n265\n00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,658\nvCenter Orchestrator, which actually, I\nthink it's name just changed to something\n\n266\n00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:58,200\nlike Envision Orchestrator or\nwhatever, Orchestrator is a product.\n\n267\n00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,830\nThese products let you create a private\ncloud, and link it to a public cloud,\n\n268\n00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,950\nand by doing that, you can have servers\nthat you move back and forth between them.\n\n269\n00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,210\nMaybe I've got a web server,\nI need to build a web server.\n\n270\n00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,750\nLet's use this as an example.\n\n271\n00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,040\nAnd so while I'm building it I\nwant to build it right here,\n\n272\n00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,100\nright in my own system,\ncuz it's not protected yet.\n\n273\n00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,410\nI've gotta configure it's firewall,\nset all it's permissions, so\n\n274\n00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,930\nI configure it here.\n\n275\n00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,720\nI get up and running, I test it.\n\n276\n00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,640\nEverything's working\nfine here in my building.\n\n277\n00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,770\nAnd then I go into Microsoft System\nCenter Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n278\n00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,310\nOr I go into my OpenStack\nmanagement portal.\n\n279\n00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,500\nAnd I say, take this machine and move it\nthis server up here in Microsoft Azure or\n\n280\n00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,280\nin Amazon EC2, and it moves it over there.\n\n281\n00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,800\nAnd now it's out there in the cloud.\n\n282\n00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,250\nIt's in the public cloud.\n\n283\n00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,040\nAnd, if I'm having some problems with\nthat server I might wanna yank it from\n\n284\n00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,170\nthe public cloud, and bring it down here,\nand put it back into my private cloud.\n\n285\n00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,750\nIt allows us to create a hybrid\nwhere we link the two together and\n\n286\n00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,020\nmost people use that for\ntransition, right.\n\n287\n00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,870\nI'm moving my company to the cloud,\nnot all at once, but\n\n288\n00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,570\npiece by piece and eventually\nit'll all be in the public cloud.\n\n289\n00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,730\nBut other people do use\nit on a permanent basis.\n\n290\n00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,220\nI've got some data, this is private, it's\ngotta stay here in the building with me\n\n291\n00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,750\nbut this other data can go out there and\nbe public.\n\n292\n00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,779\nNow, we get the best of both worlds.\n\n293\n00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,168\nAll right, so that's definitely something\nwe have to think about as we start to\n\n294\n00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,630\nimplement this, is exactly which of\nthe models that we're gonna be following.\n\n295\n00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,910\nNow, when people talk about going into\nthe cloud, one of the big things,\n\n296\n00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,030\none of the big fears that I always hear\nabout, is how it's gonna eliminate jobs.\n\n297\n00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,865\nIf I've got a company that has 20 IT\npeople on staff, and I go to the cloud,\n\n298\n00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:42,480\nI can fire all them, I just need one IT\nguy, you know somebody to go around and\n\n299\n00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,940\nmake sure the lights are on the morning\nand that's not really true.\n\n300\n00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,990\nEach job role inside of an IT department\nhas different ways they can take\n\n301\n00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,740\nadvantage of the cloud, and\nit's not so much eliminating a person,\n\n302\n00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,090\nI mean it may well be depends\non exactly what their role is.\n\n303\n00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,770\nSo for example, I mentioned if we use\nAmazon EC2 they host our servers.\n\n304\n00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,130\nWe spin our servers up there,\nthey take care of all the hardware.\n\n305\n00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,780\nSo if you have an employee\nwho just does hardware work.\n\n306\n00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,290\nThen yeah, they become somewhat\nredundant when you're in the cloud.\n\n307\n00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,970\nIf you have somebody whose\nsole job is to go around and\n\n308\n00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,980\nreplace failed hard drives, then well I\nguess there's really two things, right.\n\n309\n00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,200\nOne, that they need to update their skills\nto be able to do something more than\n\n310\n00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,860\nreplace hard drives.\n\n311\n00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,115\nAnd two,\nyou must have some really bad hard drives.\n\n312\n00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:30,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n313\n00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,470\nit's not common to have\nan employee like that.\n\n314\n00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,140\nBut with EC2,\nthey take care of the hardware.\n\n315\n00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,780\nYou still have to manage the OS.\n\n316\n00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,060\nYou still have to load the software.\n\n317\n00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,960\nYou still have to configure it.\n\n318\n00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,470\nYou treat it just like a server here in\nthe building with you, the only difference\n\n319\n00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,940\nis if a hard drive fails at 2:00 A.M.\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n320\n00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,400\nSomebody else does.\n\n321\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,357\nIf the power supply dies,\nif the Internet connection goes down,\n\n322\n00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:55,532\nwell in every Amazon region they've\ngot five Internet connections,\n\n323\n00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,142\nso if one goes down they just\nflip to one of the other ones.\n\n324\n00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:01,533\n>> You don't have to deal with it,\nthat's the nice thing about it.\n\n325\n00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:05,505\nAnd so if you do you have a job\nthat is solely responsible for\n\n326\n00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,950\ndoing hardware repair, then yes.\n\n327\n00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,641\nThe cloud is a threat.\n\n328\n00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,613\nAlthough I will say,\n\n329\n00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:13,070\nyou can get a job with the cloud providers\nbecause they need people like you.\n\n330\n00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,550\nAnd if you're Google and you have\na data center with 10,000 servers.\n\n331\n00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,270\nHow many hard drives do you\nthink you have fail a day?\n\n332\n00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,001\nHundreds.\n\n333\n00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:21,863\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can guarantee it.\n\n334\n00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:25,082\nHard drives fail, they do that and\na lot of them are going to SSDs now, so\n\n335\n00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:26,530\nthat rate starts to go down.\n\n336\n00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,080\nBut you guys get what I'm saying is,\nit's not that your job is eliminated.\n\n337\n00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,688\nIt might be eliminated with that company,\nbut\n\n338\n00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,342\nit's just it's moved to the company\nthat's providing the cloud service.\n\n339\n00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:35,251\nYeah, but the jobs are still there.\n\n340\n00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:39,155\n>> And your company still has things\nlike its own internet connectivity and\n\n341\n00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:42,227\nthe help desk and client computers and\nthings like that,\n\n342\n00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,731\nso it's not like there's\nnothing left to do.\n\n343\n00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,087\nAnd like Don said as well, you still\nhave to install operating systems,\n\n344\n00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,890\nconfigure them, do updates,\nthird party software.\n\n345\n00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,560\nThat's usually just not gonna fall into\nthe hands of them with EC2 Amazon,\n\n346\n00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,890\nit's gonna be your baby.\n\n347\n00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,026\n>> So if I'm a sys admin, so I'm\na systems administrator for my company,\n\n348\n00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:07,971\nthe way I can take advantage the cloud\nis by moving my servers up there for\n\n349\n00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:10,951\nincreased availability and redundancy.\n\n350\n00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:14,745\nI can have my servers up there in the\ncloud and know that if a hard drive fails,\n\n351\n00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,551\nif power fails,\nif the internet connection goes down.\n\n352\n00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:21,170\nIf any of those things happen,\nthe cloud provider takes care of it.\n\n353\n00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,910\nAnd they've got a team of some of\nthe highest paid network engineers and\n\n354\n00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,060\nsys admins in the world, cuz we're talking\nabout people with budgets way beyond ours.\n\n355\n00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,210\nWe can take advantage of that and\nit results in increased up time for\n\n356\n00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,360\nour end users and they appreciate that and\n\n357\n00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,590\nwe still manage the servers like\nnormal as far as software and so on.\n\n358\n00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,960\nIf I'm a developer I can really take\nadvantage of the cloud with a developer,\n\n359\n00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,160\nlet's say, I'm a PHP developer.\n\n360\n00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,180\nI can write PHP webpages like crazy.\n\n361\n00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,215\nI can do amazing shopping cart apps and\nstuff like that, but\n\n362\n00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,961\nI don't know the first thing\nabout server hardware.\n\n363\n00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,302\nI don't know the first thing\nabout Linux distributions or\n\n364\n00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,250\nMicrosoft Windows server or whatever.\n\n365\n00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,391\nI go PHP, I'm a developer, as an example.\n\n366\n00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:09,734\nI don't know anything about PHP,\nI know how to spell it.\n\n367\n00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,604\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So if I'm a developer like that\n\n368\n00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,186\nand I wanna write an application and\nI wanna test it or\n\n369\n00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:17,882\nI want to make it available to the public,\nI need to build some servers up and\n\n370\n00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,050\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n371\n00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,903\nBut with the cloud, I can go out and\nI can say, you know what?\n\n372\n00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,000\nJust give me a server that\nwill run my PHP application.\n\n373\n00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,471\nHere, let me show you\nguys an example in EC2.\n\n374\n00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,893\nIf I'm a developer and I wanna throw\nmy PHP app out there on the internet,\n\n375\n00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:37,604\nI can jump in my EC2 console, I go down\nto Elastic Beanstalk and I can tell it,\n\n376\n00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:42,330\nI need a launch up an all new\nenvironment to host my application.\n\n377\n00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,694\nI can come in here and\ntell it what I wanna whip up,\n\n378\n00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:48,001\nI wanna create a web server,\nif it's a PHP app, I need a web server.\n\n379\n00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,960\nAnd we just give it some kind of name,\n\n380\n00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,940\nI'll go with my default here leave\nthat be and I tell my platform.\n\n381\n00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,160\nI say, look I've got a PHP app or\nno JS or Python, Ruby whatever it is and\n\n382\n00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,481\nit's gonna fire up, all taught I want\nload balancing and auto scaling.\n\n383\n00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:07,216\nThat means is going to give\nme more than one server and\n\n384\n00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,205\nif my applications start to get busy,\n\n385\n00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:13,900\nit'll start cloning more servers to make\nit run faster and faster and faster.\n\n386\n00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,677\nAnd then when I'm not\nrunning with all users,\n\n387\n00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,239\nit'll prune off servers to make\nit smaller, smaller, smaller.\n\n388\n00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,342\nSo, it's gonna take care\nof all of that for me and\n\n389\n00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,230\nall I have to use upload\nmy application to it.\n\n390\n00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,291\nIt's right here on the next screen.\n\n391\n00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,850\nI come in and I tell it, I need to\nupload my application and send it along.\n\n392\n00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,360\nOr I can do a sample application, I guess.\n\n393\n00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,200\nI can throw that in there and I don't\nreally have to provide any other answers,\n\n394\n00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,092\nwe can kind of just click\nnext to the rest of this, but\n\n395\n00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,271\nwe just give it some names here.\n\n396\n00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,771\nWhat am I gonna name my application,\ngive it a description if we want and\n\n397\n00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:45,853\nthis name's actually\nalready taken I'm sure.\n\n398\n00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:51,610\nSo we'll call this my itprotv,\nwe'll just update that name a little bit.\n\n399\n00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,591\nThere we go.\n\n400\n00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,605\nAnd I can come through and\nprovide this application environment and\n\n401\n00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:59,740\nat the end of the day,\nit's gonna whip this up.\n\n402\n00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,209\nIt's gonna make it available\nout of the internet and\n\n403\n00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,970\nI don't know anything about\nthe hardware underneath it.\n\n404\n00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,092\nI don't know whether it's got\nIntel Xeon processors or AMDs,\n\n405\n00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:12,810\nI don't know if it's got SSD\nhard drives or whatever.\n\n406\n00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,911\nI could figure out, if I dug into\nall the stuff, but I don't have to.\n\n407\n00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,540\nI don't have to know all that information.\n\n408\n00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:24,271\nIt can sort all that out for me and at the\nend of the day, I can just be a developer.\n\n409\n00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,250\nI can write my applications and\nhost them up there and were done.\n\n410\n00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,471\nSo I'm gonna hit Launch,\nit's gonna fire that up and now I'm done.\n\n411\n00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,876\nIt's configuring a ton of stuff in\nthe back end that normally a sys admin\n\n412\n00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:36,401\nwould do.\n\n413\n00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,280\nI don't need that, I can just\nwhip this up, throw it in place.\n\n414\n00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,310\nNow that's great for\ntesting and even great for\n\n415\n00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,140\nthrowing out into production too.\n\n416\n00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,310\nBut eventually, as your app grows,\n\n417\n00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,260\nyou will need a better understanding\nof that underlying technology and\n\n418\n00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,000\nthat's where I want to reach out to sys\nadmins or other people like that to help.\n\n419\n00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,195\nBut if you are just a developer by\nyourself you're like a single developer\n\n420\n00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,761\nand you don't have a team.\n\n421\n00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,580\nWell, this is a great way to get things\nimplemented that you wouldn't normally\n\n422\n00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,840\nhave the resources to do.\n\n423\n00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,271\n>> And what if I'm in management?\n\n424\n00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,740\nIs the cloud even pertinent to me,\nas well?\n\n425\n00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,911\n>> This is where a lot of\ncloud pressure comes from.\n\n426\n00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:13,579\nIT guys as kind of a general rule, once a\ntechnology is implemented, they kinda like\n\n427\n00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:18,278\nto just sit back and let it run if there's\nno problems, don't don't rock the boat.\n\n428\n00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,690\nBut CIOs as chief information officer,\nthey read a magazine, they read Forbes\n\n429\n00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,910\nreports, Gartner reports and they say\nin there companies can save money.\n\n430\n00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,627\nCompanies can have better up time,\ncompanies can have better stability and\n\n431\n00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:36,071\ngrowth rates and all of these great\nthings if they leverage the cloud.\n\n432\n00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,051\nAnd so what's the CIO gonna do?\n\n433\n00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,131\nThey're gonna look at it and\nsay, well, we need this.\n\n434\n00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:43,129\nSo they're usually the ones pushing this\nforward to making companies go to it and\n\n435\n00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:45,760\nit's good thing, there's so\nmany advantages.\n\n436\n00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,832\nAt a minimum just your bottom line,\nyour financial dollars,\n\n437\n00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:54,390\nyour your IT budget can be significantly\nreduced by using the cloud.\n\n438\n00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,696\nAn example would be,\nif I wanted to buy a physical server,\n\n439\n00:21:57,696 --> 00:22:00,480\nso that web app I was just talking about.\n\n440\n00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,608\nIf I was to deploy a web app like that,\n\n441\n00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:05,581\nI would use usually like\na standard one use server.\n\n442\n00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:10,650\nSo we might go somewhere like Dell and\ngo, we'll shop their servers real quick.\n\n443\n00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,582\nSo if I wanna get a standard\none use server from Dell,\n\n444\n00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,791\nit's normally gonna be in between 5 and\n$7,000.\n\n445\n00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,356\nSo let's find one with 4 cores and\n\n446\n00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:24,880\nabout 8 gigs of RAM is probably a pretty\nstandard web server, I think it.\n\n447\n00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,520\nWe'll go low end here.\n\n448\n00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,601\nOh, not that low end.\n\n449\n00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:30,103\n[LAUGH] We'll go this low\nend like a rack mount.\n\n450\n00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,543\n>> We want this to actually work.\n\n451\n00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:32,807\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n452\n00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:35,511\nhere's like a one use server, this R220.\n\n453\n00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:40,191\nIt's not a terribly big server and you'll\nsee the price actually starts pretty low,\n\n454\n00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:44,546\nbut where things change when we start\nadding stuff to it, like redundant CPUs,\n\n455\n00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:47,160\nadditional hard drives, additional memory.\n\n456\n00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,330\nAnd in fact,\nI think this one is a short depth chassis.\n\n457\n00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,630\nI think it's only got one power supply,\nso let's go up to the next level here.\n\n458\n00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,566\nJust wanna make sure I get an Apples to\nApples to what Amazon or Microsoft Azure,\n\n459\n00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:00,800\nwhat they're using, so\n\n460\n00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,821\nthey're using something a little\nmore comparable to this.\n\n461\n00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:08,351\nSo here's a system it's got a Xeon\nprocessor in it, so it's going to 4 cores,\n\n462\n00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,361\n8 gigs of memory and yeah,\nthis one's only about 1,200 bucks.\n\n463\n00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,960\nWell, that's the price as we look at\nit right here just kind of written\n\n464\n00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,840\non the site $1,200, but\nwhat does that include?\n\n465\n00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,491\nDoes that include my\noperating system license?\n\n466\n00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,700\nDoes that include\nredundant power supplies?\n\n467\n00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,676\nDoes that include the warranty and\nthe other things that I need?\n\n468\n00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,325\nAnd by the time we get\nthese things priced out,\n\n469\n00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,235\nthey end up being a little\nbit more expensive.\n\n470\n00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,566\nLooks like I caught it on sale.\n\n471\n00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,545\nToday's a good day to buy a server.\n\n472\n00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,514\nSo when we start to dial down each of\nthe different options in here with what we\n\n473\n00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:40,005\nwanna add,\nthey seem a little more expensive.\n\n474\n00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:43,636\nSo it looks like right now,\nit is setup for a couple of hard drives.\n\n475\n00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,625\nSo it's got a four core processor in it,\nwhich is good.\n\n476\n00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,841\nWe've got basic memory is fine.\n\n477\n00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:52,230\nI'm not gonna mess around\nwith that too much and\n\n478\n00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,062\nthey're going a little cheap on the 2,\n4 gigs, but we'll leave that be.\n\n479\n00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:57,683\nNo operating system on this one.\n\n480\n00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,543\nSo I am going to need\nan operating system and\n\n481\n00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:03,318\nlet's say that I'm running Windows as Dell\nrecommended so I'll choose Windows, and\n\n482\n00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,197\nnotice my price starts\nto kind of creep up.\n\n483\n00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:08,909\nAnd then as we keep going down it\nhasn't asked about hard drives yet,\n\n484\n00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,770\nsomewhere in here,\nhere we go, hard drives.\n\n485\n00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,560\nSo, I got an error with\nthe operating system.\n\n486\n00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,525\nI need a media kit guess.\n\n487\n00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,889\nBut I need to pick a hard drive so\nwe'll do like software RAID one,\n\n488\n00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:23,866\nthat's a mirrored set of hard drives and\nso that means I'm going to need a RAID\n\n489\n00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:27,191\ncontroller, so we'll pick\nthe middle level RAID controller.\n\n490\n00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:30,092\nAnd we'll need at least two hard\ndrives if we're going to do a mirror.\n\n491\n00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:32,640\nSo, it comes with a 500 gig and\n\n492\n00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,920\nis there not an option to\npick a second 500 gig drive?\n\n493\n00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,497\nWell, you know what?\n\n494\n00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:40,620\nWe'll leave that data in for right now.\n\n495\n00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,646\nBasic management is fine, and\n\n496\n00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:47,438\nyou know what, I won't mess with\nany of these other options too.\n\n497\n00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,462\nAnd these are like,\nadditional network adapters and stuff.\n\n498\n00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:51,770\nI don't want to get too crazy with that.\n\n499\n00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,370\nIt does only have a single power supply\nthough so I want to go dual hot plug.\n\n500\n00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,630\nWe'll bump up to that, and man, I am\njust getting all sorts of errors here.\n\n501\n00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,800\nSee, this is the other challenge.\n\n502\n00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,610\nIf I want to go with a physical server,\nI gotta get it specced out, and\n\n503\n00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,150\nI've got to hunt through all\nthe different requirements\n\n504\n00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,340\nto kind of sort out what we need.\n\n505\n00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,590\nIt's telling me I need a perc S10,\nwhich I thought I had picked.\n\n506\n00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,810\nI guess I picked the wrong one.\n\n507\n00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,776\n>> Don, you can probably have\nthe server spinned up by now on EC2.\n\n508\n00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:22,086\n[LAUGH]\n>> I certainly could have.\n\n509\n00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,570\nSo we have to go through and\nspec this stuff out.\n\n510\n00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,880\nOnce it's done we get a price.\n\n511\n00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,010\nRight, now I'm going to stop right here.\n\n512\n00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,180\nIt's actually gonna be a little\nbit more expensive, but\n\n513\n00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,166\nlet's just run with this, $2168.\n\n514\n00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,290\nI didn't get to the warranty.\n\n515\n00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,337\nAnd I know the warranty is going to\nadd on to that price a good bit,\n\n516\n00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,720\nif I can even find that here in my screen.\n\n517\n00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440\nI guess it's on the next page.\n\n518\n00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,320\nSo, this is going to go up.\n\n519\n00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,110\nNow that warranty cost isn't a one\ntime thing, so year after year,\n\n520\n00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,310\nI'm going to have to pay that,\nor I can stretch it out.\n\n521\n00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,750\nIt looks like it comes with three year\nbasic but if I wanna compare to what\n\n522\n00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,260\nAmazon or Microsoft has, they're going\nto have parts for our response time.\n\n523\n00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,650\nThey're going to have rapid flip\noverrun on this kind of stuff.\n\n524\n00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,140\nSo I would need to bump\nthis little warranty up.\n\n525\n00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,508\nSo like this five by ten hardware only\nwe'd really have to go to like Pro Support\n\n526\n00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,869\nto reflect what we're\ngetting with those providers.\n\n527\n00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,634\nSo now we're at 2,860, almost $3,000.\n\n528\n00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:15,634\nAnd that's not counting the time it's\ngoing to take me to install the server in\n\n529\n00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:21,109\nthe rack to supply a power for 24 hours a\nday, 7 days a week, all year long, right.\n\n530\n00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:25,294\nThe power cost, the air conditioning\ncosts, UPS and battery backup,\n\n531\n00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,270\ngenerators if I need that.\n\n532\n00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,800\nAll of the other incidentals that\nmake this server twice, three times,\n\n533\n00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,470\nfour times that much expensive\nthe price that we see right here.\n\n534\n00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,050\nBut with Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure,\n\n535\n00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,830\nlet's use Amazon cuz their\npricing is easier to find.\n\n536\n00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,540\nWhen we use their systems and we look at\ntheir pricing we just come in here, and\n\n537\n00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,120\nwe say, look, I need a server.\n\n538\n00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,900\nLet's pick a Windows server so\nthat it's apples to apples here.\n\n539\n00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,280\nLet's do a on demand server.\n\n540\n00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,670\nWe'll go Windows, and\nI'll come in here and\n\n541\n00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,390\nI'll pick a four CPU, one with\neight gigs of RAM is what I wanted.\n\n542\n00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,080\nLooks like I might have to step up a bit\nto find one that's exactly what I want.\n\n543\n00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,580\nAnd, maybe they don't have a four and\neight, so\n\n544\n00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,550\nI might have to go a little bit higher.\n\n545\n00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,590\nWe'll go 4 and 13 like this guy.\n\n546\n00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,780\nNotice how they charge,\nme over here it's $0.53 per hour.\n\n547\n00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,100\nThey're charging me a per hour basis.\n\n548\n00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,240\nNow if I work that out with\na good ole calculator and\n\n549\n00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,663\nI say it's $0.53 per hour and\nthere's 24 hours in a day and\n\n550\n00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:34,215\nthere's 365 days in a year, that's $4642.\n\n551\n00:27:34,215 --> 00:27:37,852\nNow, the server I specced that\nwith Dell was $2800-something.\n\n552\n00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:40,922\nIt would really be more, but\nlet's just go with that 2800 number.\n\n553\n00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:44,379\nThis 4000 is including power, generators,\n\n554\n00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:49,730\nall those other different things\nto keep the server up and running.\n\n555\n00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,710\nThat 28.60 from Dell didn't include any of\nthat and I can guarantee you they work out\n\n556\n00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,240\nto at least be the same even\nif it was a break even.\n\n557\n00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,590\nYou're still getting the advantage of\nAmazon is going to completely manage that\n\n558\n00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,890\nif a hard drive fails they\ndeal with it for me right.\n\n559\n00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,080\nThat's the big advantage, and so for\n\n560\n00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,140\na CIO to look at this stuff\nit's going to cost them less.\n\n561\n00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,530\nThey're going to get a faster\nresponse time on repairs.\n\n562\n00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,850\nThey're going to get a better\nservice level agreement.\n\n563\n00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,750\nThey're going to get redundant\nInternet connections.\n\n564\n00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,660\nAll those other things that make\ntheir IT department more stable and\n\n565\n00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,750\na better experience for the end user.\n\n566\n00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,960\nAnd that's how a CIO benefits from this.\n\n567\n00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,710\nSo, sys admins, developers, CIOs.\n\n568\n00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,290\nThey all benefit from implementing\na technology like the cloud.\n\n569\n00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,820\nAnd that really all goes back to\nsomething we call risk deference, right?\n\n570\n00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,140\nThere's a lot of risk when you\nimplement your own servers,\n\n571\n00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,910\nthings that can go wrong,\nupdates that can get missed.\n\n572\n00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,710\nAnd with the cloud, you're pushing\nthat off on another company.\n\n573\n00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,470\nYou're saying I'm gonna let Amazon assume\nthat risk, I'm gonna transfer that risk\n\n574\n00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,400\nover to them, it's now their problem\nas opposed to being my problem.\n\n575\n00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,790\nAnd CIOs like that kind of stuff.\n\n576\n00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,320\n>> Yes they do, yes they do.\n\n577\n00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,430\nAnd not only that, but\nyou can easily upscale that provisioning.\n\n578\n00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,820\nIf I need more hardware,\nboom, we go right into it.\n\n579\n00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,830\nI just rock into Amazon's login there,\nadd more RAM, add more CPU,\n\n580\n00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,410\nwhatever I need, and even do other things\nthat are really awesome where it'll,\n\n581\n00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,750\nyou can say, I need more at these times,\nadd to that stuff, and\n\n582\n00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,300\nthen when I don't need it, takes it away,\nkeeps that scalable economy right there.\n\n583\n00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,360\nVery economical.\n\n584\n00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,670\n>> Yeah, and\nif I had ordered that server from Dell,\n\n585\n00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,310\nI think you guys might have saw where it\nsaid delivery time, five or seven days.\n\n586\n00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,810\nSo I'd be lucky to have it in a week and\nthen get set up and get it going.\n\n587\n00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,710\nWith Microsoft Azure or Rackspace or\nwhoever I'll have the server in minutes.\n\n588\n00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,300\nIt will be up and running and ready for\nme to start working with it very,\n\n589\n00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,770\nvery quickly and if I don't need anymore\nI can shut it down and I stop paying for\n\n590\n00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,240\nit, versus that physical server.\n\n591\n00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,340\nIf I shut down,\nI've already paid for it right?\n\n592\n00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,915\nAnd don't worry about Dell.\n\n593\n00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:47,715\nSome people are probably thinking right\nnow, oh, Dell's gonna go out of business.\n\n594\n00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:51,425\nThey're gonna do fine, because when you\nwalk into the big, giant data centers with\n\n595\n00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:53,665\ntens of thousands of servers who do you\nthink they're buying them from, right?\n\n596\n00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,685\nSo they're just selling them to\na different kind of client than us.\n\n597\n00:29:56,685 --> 00:30:01,995\nAnd that's where the cloud really\nstarts to come in handy, cuz Microsoft,\n\n598\n00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:04,915\nRackspace, those guys, they'll buy tens\nof thousands of servers so we get them\n\n599\n00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:08,980\ncheaper than when we buy 5 servers or\neven 50 servers for that matter.\n\n600\n00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,690\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n601\n00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,018\nWell, Don, have we, I mean I think this\nis a good generalization, overview.\n\n602\n00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:17,473\nKind of take away some of the mystic\nmystical things around the cloud that's\n\n603\n00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:18,735\nhovering around it.\n\n604\n00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,880\nA lot people get a little\nconfused by this.\n\n605\n00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,650\nI think we've done a really good job\ntoday of hopefully demystifying that.\n\n606\n00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,695\n>> Absolutely and we intentionally\nkept this one pretty general.\n\n607\n00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,014\nSo if you thinking,\nman these guys didn't cover any details,\n\n608\n00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:32,110\nwhat kind of garbage was this?\n\n609\n00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,805\nI feel you.\n\n610\n00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:38,310\n[LAUGH] But stay tuned because we've got a\nwhole series coming up where we dive into\n\n611\n00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,280\nreal world examples,\npractical applications.\n\n612\n00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,520\nWe actually show Microsoft Azure and\nAmazon AWS.\n\n613\n00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,870\nYou get a chance to see those\ntechnologies in action.\n\n614\n00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,900\nThey're really cool.\n\n615\n00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,650\nDon't be intimidated by it.\n\n616\n00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,360\nThe cloud is the place\nyou need to be right now.\n\n617\n00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,790\nIt's just so\nmany advantages to being there.\n\n618\n00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,290\n>> Yep.\nAll right.\n\n619\n00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,685\nWell, that being said, I think we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n620\n00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:01,495\nSo from the ITProTV studios I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n621\n00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:02,275\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n622\n00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,390\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n623\n00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,800\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,433\nI'll be your host today, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,153\nHere with me is Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:19,092\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,231\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,944\nLet me tell you, we're back with\nanother episode of cloud fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:27,444\nAnd in this episode we want to take a step\nback from the keyboard for a moment and\n\n9\n00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,143\ncover a couple of terms\nthat you're going to be\n\n10\n00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:33,490\nseeing a lot as you work\nwith any cloud technology.\n\n11\n00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,390\nIt's really important to understand some\nof the fundamentals before you dive into\n\n12\n00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,070\nwhat could potentially be tens of\nthousands of dollars in expenses and\n\n13\n00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,510\nnot actually know what we want.\n\n14\n00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,560\nOne of the obstacles you'll bump\ninto as a sysadmin, or a dev ops, or\n\n15\n00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,540\nwhatever your title is where your CIO\nwill come into your office one day.\n\n16\n00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,333\nAnd say, boy, I read this great Forbes\narticle or a Gartner Group article or\n\n17\n00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,542\nwhatever, and\nwe need to move to the cloud.\n\n18\n00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,103\nWe need to get as much of\nour technology in the cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:02,660\nAnd you look at them,\nand you say, well, okay.\n\n20\n00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,470\nWhat part of the cloud do\nyou actually want to use?\n\n21\n00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,360\nAnd they say, it doesn't matter.\n\n22\n00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,370\nJust get the stuff in the cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,540\nThat's where it needs to be.\n\n24\n00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,780\nEvery cutting edge\ncompany is in the cloud.\n\n25\n00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,900\nWell, that's one of the problems\nwe have with a buzzword.\n\n26\n00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,740\nA buzzword like cloud computing where it\ndidn't have a well defined definition\n\n27\n00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,420\nin the beginning, and so,\nnow it means all sorts of stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,750\nAnd you don't know what it means.\n\n29\n00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,300\nAnd so if somebody says,\nget your technology in the cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,530\nThey might as well say,\nmake your technology great.\n\n31\n00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,690\nIt's not [LAUGH] really defined.\n\n32\n00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,500\nYou've got to figure that out.\n\n33\n00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,510\nAnd so there's some additional terms that\nhave kind of surfaced over the years\n\n34\n00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,870\nthat help us to categorize the types\nof cloud services that are out there.\n\n35\n00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,369\nAnd they are, platform as a service,\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n36\n00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,161\nand software as a service.\n\n37\n00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:52,570\nAnd so you'll hear people talk\nabout SaaS or PaaS or IaaS.\n\n38\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,551\nThey don't like to say that one as a word.\n\n39\n00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:58,305\n[LAUGH] So you hear those mentioned and\nthose are a lot more descriptive as far as\n\n40\n00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:02,030\nwhat we're actually going to be doing\nwhen we move our stuff into the cloud.\n\n41\n00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,290\nAll right, so let's take each of these and\n\n42\n00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,080\nwe'll just kind of break them\ndown with what they are.\n\n43\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,440\nAnd I want to talk about each one in a\ncertain order, kind of the order that most\n\n44\n00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,390\npeople dab their toe in with or\nwhatever as we move forward.\n\n45\n00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,520\nAnd for somebody like me,\n\n46\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,650\nI've been a system administrator for\na long time supporting servers.\n\n47\n00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,690\nAt a company what I'll normally do is\nhelp to get servers up and running,\n\n48\n00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,940\nsoftware loaded,\nkeep operations running smooth.\n\n49\n00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,160\nWhen I do my job right,\nnobody knows that I'm there.\n\n50\n00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,820\nBut when things go wrong,\nI'm Johnny on the spot.\n\n51\n00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,090\nAnd I'm there replacing that hard drive,\nreplacing power supplies,\n\n52\n00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,570\nupdating operating systems,\ndoing that kind of thing.\n\n53\n00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,830\nWell that's a lot of work, and\nit's round the clock work.\n\n54\n00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,600\nDaniel, you've done on the call work,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,920\n>> Oh yeah, you get that call\nlate at night and they say hey,\n\n56\n00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,698\none of the servers is down.\n\n57\n00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,980\nWe need you to get that back\nup as soon as possible and\n\n58\n00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,322\nyou're like, who is this again?\n\n59\n00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:53,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n60\n00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,630\nit turns out to be something like\na failed hard drive in a RAID array or\n\n61\n00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,330\nfailed power supply which is just\na matter of swapping hardware.\n\n62\n00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,440\nBut it's 2:00 a.m, you gotta go\ndown to the data center to do it.\n\n63\n00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,720\nWell that's no fun.\n\n64\n00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,320\nSo wouldn't it be nice if we could just\noutsource our hardware to somebody else?\n\n65\n00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,940\nAnd that's the first one\nthat I wanna talk about,\n\n66\n00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,570\nit's called infrastructure as a service or\nIaaS.\n\n67\n00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,360\nInfrastructure as\na service is where we say,\n\n68\n00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,510\nwe don't want to deal with\nour hardware anymore right?\n\n69\n00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,741\nI don't want to have to worry\nabout hard drives failing.\n\n70\n00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:23,881\nI don't have to worry\nabout power supplies.\n\n71\n00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,222\nI don't want to keep\nservers under warranty.\n\n72\n00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,321\nI don't want to buy physical servers.\n\n73\n00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,800\nI just don't want to deal with that stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,321\nAnd if a hard drive fails at 2 a.m.,\nI want somebody else to sort that out,\n\n75\n00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,495\nright?\n\n76\n00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:40,995\nBut I still want control, I still want\nto choose what operating system I run.\n\n77\n00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:44,365\nI wanna choose when I do my updates,\nand what updates I wanna do.\n\n78\n00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,955\nAnd I wanna choose what software I load.\n\n79\n00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:47,765\nI want control of that.\n\n80\n00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,305\nI just want somebody else\nto take over the hardware,\n\n81\n00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,280\ncuz it's gonna waste\na lot of money that way.\n\n82\n00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,490\nThat's what infrastructure\nas a service is all about.\n\n83\n00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,220\n>> Now wait a minute, Don.\n\n84\n00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,820\nYou're telling me that someone else is\ngonna actually handle all those 2:00 a.m\n\n85\n00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,600\ncalls and not moi, yours truly.\n\n86\n00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,695\n>> I know, it's [CROSSTALK].\n\n87\n00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,911\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sign me up, where do we sign,\n\n88\n00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,830\nwhat's that page again?\n\n89\n00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,310\n>> That in and\nof itself is reason to do it, right?\n\n90\n00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,590\nBut what's even better is not only\nare they gonna take responsibility of it,\n\n91\n00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,930\nthey're gonna do a better job than you.\n\n92\n00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,700\nAnd I know we all say\nI kinda know my stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,190\nI can do a pretty good job.\n\n94\n00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,010\nYou can, but you're one person.\n\n95\n00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,763\nIf you have 1,000 servers,\ncan you support it?\n\n96\n00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:25,695\nYou might need a staff.\n\n97\n00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:30,420\nYou might need 10, 20,\n30 people to do it, and that costs money.\n\n98\n00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,430\nAnd in your area,\nwe're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n99\n00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,160\nThere's only so\nmany people here in Gainesville.\n\n100\n00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,420\nIf I wanna find good\nsystem administrators,\n\n101\n00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,280\nhow many are there really in this city?\n\n102\n00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,110\nI'm gonna have to bring people in.\n\n103\n00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,810\nWell, Microsoft, or Amazon, or\nRackspace, or Media Temple,\n\n104\n00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,890\nthose companies that offer this type of\nservice, they've already got that staff.\n\n105\n00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,770\nNot only do they have them, but\n\n106\n00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,670\nthey have some of the best people in the\nworld because their data centers are huge.\n\n107\n00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,930\nAnd they've got the money\nbehind it to do that.\n\n108\n00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,160\nThey're building data centers that\nare well beyond what we need.\n\n109\n00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,414\nThey're building data centers with tens\nof thousands of servers with redundant\n\n110\n00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:08,181\nInternet connections, power generators,\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n111\n00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,938\nThat while we would like to have for\nour own businesses,\n\n112\n00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:14,060\nwe couldn't possibly afford,\nwe can take advantage of that.\n\n113\n00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,550\nWe can use their resources,\n\n114\n00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,510\nand that's what infrastructure\nas a service is all about.\n\n115\n00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,800\nNow we got a little diagram here,\n\n116\n00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,140\nlet me show you guys this,\nthat kind of explains what IaaS is, right?\n\n117\n00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,350\nYou've got your own data center,\nyour own headquarters, your business and\n\n118\n00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,820\nyou probably have local servers.\n\n119\n00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,220\nAll right, but you can connect up to\nthird party providers on the Internet and\n\n120\n00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,440\nthey can provide access to\nnetworking gear, hard drives for\n\n121\n00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,220\nstorage, physical servers, virtual\nservers, all the resources you need.\n\n122\n00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,390\nAnd you just manage the operating systems,\nyou manage the software.\n\n123\n00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,270\nEverything underneath is\ntaken care of by them.\n\n124\n00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,750\nThat's really what infrastructure\nas a service is all about.\n\n125\n00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,660\nNow when you jump into an agreement\nlike this, a partnership,\n\n126\n00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,160\nyou have to choose a provider wisely.\n\n127\n00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,850\nYou've got a lot of choices out there,\nMicrosoft, Amazon,\n\n128\n00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,080\nall these different guys.\n\n129\n00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,720\nBut you also need to choose one\nthat provides what you need.\n\n130\n00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,405\nA lot of us, one of the big advantages\nof going to infrastructure as a service\n\n131\n00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:13,135\nis that we can get infrastructure\nall over the world, right?.\n\n132\n00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,275\nITProTV, yeah, you know,\nwe have one building.\n\n133\n00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,945\nIt's right here,\nit's in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n134\n00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:20,240\nSo if I wanna bring up my own physical\nserver it's gonna be right here.\n\n135\n00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,280\nWhat if I want a physical\nserver in Europe so\n\n136\n00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,830\nthat people in Europe watching our\nshow will be closer to that content.\n\n137\n00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,520\nWe don't have a data center in Europe.\n\n138\n00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,070\nWe'd have to go and buy a building.\n\n139\n00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,620\nWe'd have to put in UPSs.\n\n140\n00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,591\nWe'd have to put in generators.\n\n141\n00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,670\nWe'd have to put in all the various\nthings to build out a small data center.\n\n142\n00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,712\nOr we could just go to Amazon EC2,\nor Microsoft Azure, or Rackspace,\n\n143\n00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:41,289\nMedia Temple, and say hey,\n\n144\n00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,861\ncan you guys can give me some\nvirtual servers that are in Europe?\n\n145\n00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:48,092\nAnd they'll say sure,\nwe'll have it within minutes, right?\n\n146\n00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:50,436\nNot the months and\nmonths of planning it would take for\n\n147\n00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,370\nme to open in a new data center.\n\n148\n00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,650\nMinutes, you just punch\nthe buttons on the screen.\n\n149\n00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,471\nRight, well we'll see that all the\nepisodes that are coming down the line.\n\n150\n00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,588\nThat is super amazing,\nand then I tell them, hey,\n\n151\n00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,220\nI need five servers running CentOS Linux.\n\n152\n00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,000\nAnd they say, okay.\n\n153\n00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,830\nThree minutes later,\nI got five servers running CentOS Linux.\n\n154\n00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,610\nAnd I say, ooh, you gotta spec those\nall out with two gigs of RAM each.\n\n155\n00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,300\nI need eight gigs of RAM in each.\n\n156\n00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,240\nAll right.\n\n157\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,260\nTwo minutes later,\nthey've all got eight gigs of RAM.\n\n158\n00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,710\nAnd within a matter of minutes,\nI've got a data center built out.\n\n159\n00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,100\nAnd it's in Europe, and\nit's close to my customers over there.\n\n160\n00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,210\nAnd so\nthey're getting local access in data.\n\n161\n00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,440\nAnd if I decide it's not\ngetting enough traffic I'm\n\n162\n00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,290\ngoing to shut that data center down.\n\n163\n00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,034\nWell I don't have to sell off my property.\n\n164\n00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,392\nI don't have to put the land up for\nauction or anything.\n\n165\n00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,840\nI just shut the servers down and\nthat's it.\n\n166\n00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,010\nIt's all virtual anyway right.\n\n167\n00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,380\nI don't have to pay for that.\n\n168\n00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,100\nThat's what infrastructure as a service\ngives us, and that's a big benefit.\n\n169\n00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,430\nBut we maintain control over our\noperating systems and our software,\n\n170\n00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,070\nso that's a double edged sword, right?\n\n171\n00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,820\nOn one hand, I pick what\noperating systems I want to run.\n\n172\n00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,879\nI pick what updates I want to apply.\n\n173\n00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,463\nAnd if I don't apply an update,\nI get hacked and\n\n174\n00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,412\nmy data gets compromised, right?\n\n175\n00:07:56,412 --> 00:08:00,592\nSo, I still have that same level of\ncontrol I would with my local data.\n\n176\n00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,683\nBut the hardware part is being outsourced.\n\n177\n00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,678\nThat's infrastructure as a service.\n\n178\n00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:05,930\n>> Yeah, and that's really nice.\n\n179\n00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,170\nBecause then, you still have that control.\n\n180\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,370\nI mean, a lot of guys,\nI know, myself, personally,\n\n181\n00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,120\nwould like having all that control\nover updates and things like that.\n\n182\n00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,200\nThat can be really helpful for\nme especially in our business.\n\n183\n00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,815\nA lot of times they need to just\nspecify certain things to be done or\n\n184\n00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,140\nmaybe put off until a later time.\n\n185\n00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,610\nAnd I got some European guy that's doing\nit for me as far as the hardware goes.\n\n186\n00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,980\nI know I like that action.\n\n187\n00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,990\n>> And they're the ones on call.\n\n188\n00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,585\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,132\n>> Let me show you guys some pictures so\n\n190\n00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:33,400\nyou get kind of an idea of\nwhat a data center looks like.\n\n191\n00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,445\nMicrosoft actually put out a little\ntour of one of their data centers so\n\n192\n00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:37,370\nwe could see it.\n\n193\n00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,220\nAnd here's an example, they've got\nthousands of servers that are racked up in\n\n194\n00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,080\nthese data centers all nice and\nneat, water cooled so\n\n195\n00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,920\nwe don't have to think about things\nlike temperature cooling at all.\n\n196\n00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,600\nThey have to worry about that a lot\nbecause they have so many servers.\n\n197\n00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,420\nThey've got massive chillers and air\nconditioning units to keep things cool.\n\n198\n00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,790\nThey've got UPSs that are beyond\nimagination, and tens of thousands\n\n199\n00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,640\nof 12-volt batteries that are available to\nprovide power if there's a power outage.\n\n200\n00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,920\nThat's for short term outages.\n\n201\n00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,770\nIf it's a long term outage,\nthey've got massive generators, and\n\n202\n00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,121\nyou can't see in this picture.\n\n203\n00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:10,622\nWe see two of the generators, but\nthere's actually two more beyond this.\n\n204\n00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,470\nAnd these massive generators,\n\n205\n00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,582\nthey can keep the data center going for\ndays even if power has been lost.\n\n206\n00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:20,882\nThat's all stuff provided when we\ndo infrastructure as a service, and\n\n207\n00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,181\nthat was Microsoft.\n\n208\n00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:26,592\nAmazon's EC2, Rackspace's, Cloud,\nMedia Temple any of those guys,\n\n209\n00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,701\nthey're all doing the same thing.\n\n210\n00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,242\nThey're building out state of the art,\nhighly-redundant data centers so\n\n211\n00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,070\nyou don't have to.\n\n212\n00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,210\nSo when your CIO comes to you and says\nwe need to get our stuff into the cloud.\n\n213\n00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,060\nIf they're just concerned\nabout hardware reliability and\n\n214\n00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,530\ncost, then this is what they want,\nIAAS, that's the solution they want.\n\n215\n00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,840\nYou still maintain control of everything.\n\n216\n00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,530\nBut what if what they want\nis a little bit different?\n\n217\n00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,620\nWhat if they keep reading these\narticles about how such and\n\n218\n00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,610\nsuch company got hacked, and\nall their customer data got out, right?\n\n219\n00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,700\nThere was an exploit in Windows or an\nexploit in Linux or an exploit in MacOS.\n\n220\n00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,878\nThey don't want to be that person.\n\n221\n00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:09,710\nThey don't wanna have to send out that\nletter to all their customers saying,\n\n222\n00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,250\nsorry guys we got hacked.\n\n223\n00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,950\nSo they want somebody to not only\ntake over the hardware, but take over\n\n224\n00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,540\nthe operating systems as well to maintain\nwhat's called the platform, right.\n\n225\n00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,250\nSo in that scenario, IAAS doesn't work.\n\n226\n00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,100\nIaas, you're still responsible for the OS.\n\n227\n00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,130\nIf there's an exploit for\nWindows, you've gotta patch it.\n\n228\n00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,700\nBut with Platform as a Service,\nPAAS, Platform as a Service,\n\n229\n00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,990\nthey take care of not only the underlying\nhardware, but the operating system also.\n\n230\n00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,980\nSo that helps to ensure that your\nunderlying OS is configured properly.\n\n231\n00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,610\nYou're still responsible for the software.\n\n232\n00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,290\nRight?\nYou've gotta load software on top of this,\n\n233\n00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,520\nand that's your problem.\n\n234\n00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,430\nBut the OS is taken care of.\n\n235\n00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,430\nThis is great for\nIT departments that are looking to\n\n236\n00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,270\nremove some of the risk of running OSs,\nespecially ones you're not familiar with.\n\n237\n00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,980\nMaybe you need a Linux server, but\nyou've never worked with Linux.\n\n238\n00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,900\nWell spin it up on a platform\nas a service environment, and\n\n239\n00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,970\nthey'll manage the Linux part for you.\n\n240\n00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,280\nYou just throw you application on it.\n\n241\n00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,950\nRight?\nThat's a great thing.\n\n242\n00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,690\nIt's also great for developers.\n\n243\n00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,730\nMaybe you're a developer, and\nyou've written a PHP application, right?\n\n244\n00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,960\nOr a Ruby or node.JS, or whatever.\n\n245\n00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,330\nAnd you are the Ruby on Rails master.\n\n246\n00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,200\nYou know everything there is\nto know about Ruby on Rails.\n\n247\n00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,530\nYou can write applications and do amazing\nthings, but you don't know the first thing\n\n248\n00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,040\nabout Linux or Apache, you don't know\nthe first thing about the server hardware.\n\n249\n00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,990\nYou're a developer, you shouldn't have to.\n\n250\n00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,680\nSo you can go out and\nuse a platform as a service provider.\n\n251\n00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,550\nAnd they can give you the hardware and\nthe OS and even Apache,\n\n252\n00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,280\nyour web server, fully tuned,\noptimized, fully managed.\n\n253\n00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,530\nYou don't worry about it,\n\n254\n00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,290\nyou just load your web application\non there and now it runs.\n\n255\n00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,590\nAnd not only does it run, it scales.\n\n256\n00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,560\nIt can get massive.\n\n257\n00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,950\nYou can jump from 100 users one\nday to 1 million users the next\n\n258\n00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,710\nday if your product goes viral, right?\n\n259\n00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,940\nThat's part of what platform as\na service helps insulate us from.\n\n260\n00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,182\nIt gives us a lot of protection from that,\nall right?\n\n261\n00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,040\nSo, just kind of showing here an example,\n\n262\n00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,060\nif we do platform as a service they\ntake care of the OS, the hardware.\n\n263\n00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,249\nAll I have to worry about are my\ndatabases, my programming software,\n\n264\n00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:13,932\nthe stuff that I throw on top of that.\n\n265\n00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:18,486\nAnd my dev team, they can be all around\nthe world, all accessing that platform via\n\n266\n00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,852\nthe Internet, via their web\nbrowser in a lot of cases, and so\n\n267\n00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:24,780\nI don't need a ton of\ninfrastructure to do it.\n\n268\n00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,830\nIt's a really cool solution,\nPlatform as a Service.\n\n269\n00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,010\nIn our mind we just need to remember\nthat Platform as a Service counts for\n\n270\n00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,610\nthe hardware and the operating system.\n\n271\n00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,380\nAnything on top of that,\nthat's up to us, right?\n\n272\n00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,810\nIt might include the web server,\nsometimes they do that.\n\n273\n00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,528\nBut if we write our own application and\nwe throw it on there and\n\n274\n00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,101\nthe application isn't working,\nthat's our problem.\n\n275\n00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:50,361\nIf there's a security exploit in our\napplication, that's our problem.\n\n276\n00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:54,196\nBut if there's a security exploit in\nthe operating system or the web server,\n\n277\n00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:56,340\nthe hardware, they take care of that.\n\n278\n00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,840\nIt's fully managed,\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n279\n00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,460\nIn fact, a lot of times you don't even\nknow what the underlying OS is, right?\n\n280\n00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,150\nIt might be Ubuntu, Linux,\nor it might be DBM Linux.\n\n281\n00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,420\nYou might know that it is Linux, but\n\n282\n00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,120\nyou might not know which distribution,\ncuz you don't have to.\n\n283\n00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,850\nThey manage it.\n\n284\n00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,290\nThat's the cool stuff that you get here.\n\n285\n00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,680\nSo you see this used mostly by developers.\n\n286\n00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,000\nPeople want to whip up an app,\nif you have a great idea for\n\n287\n00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,480\nthe next big web 3.0 website, right?\n\n288\n00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,120\nOr look historically,\npeople like Twitter, right?\n\n289\n00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,930\nWhen when Twitter was originally\ncreated they wrote up this application,\n\n290\n00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,530\nand they said this is awesome.\n\n291\n00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,220\nBut what if we have a million users?\n\n292\n00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,660\nWe can't scale like that.\n\n293\n00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,220\nAnd so they went to Amazon EC2,\nand they brought it up there.\n\n294\n00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,400\nNetflix did the same thing where,\nhey we need to stream out tons and\n\n295\n00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,580\ntons of video every single day.\n\n296\n00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,640\nSo they went to Amazon, and\nthey spun up their servers there so\n\n297\n00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,410\nthat Amazon would manage that underlying\nOS and not have to worry about it.\n\n298\n00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,230\nSo different vendors go different routes.\n\n299\n00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,110\nAnd usually as you grow\n\n300\n00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,360\nthere does come a tipping point\nwhere you say, you know what?\n\n301\n00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,580\nLet me bring that back in-house.\n\n302\n00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,350\nWe're making enough money now that\nwe can build our own data center,\n\n303\n00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,130\nwe can hire own staff.\n\n304\n00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,510\nBut for a lot of people,\nit's the opposite.\n\n305\n00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,190\nYou want to push that out in the cloud\nbecause they've got multiple data centers,\n\n306\n00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,450\nhighly trained staff, and\nit's pretty economical.\n\n307\n00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,340\n>> Yeah, and I would say that another\nadvantage would be just the fact of how\n\n308\n00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,440\neasy it is to get a server up and running.\n\n309\n00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,960\nIf I'm a developer,\nI'm not a guy that does servers, right?\n\n310\n00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,350\nI'm working on code all day.\n\n311\n00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,780\nBut maybe I need a SQL database and\na server up and\n\n312\n00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,440\nrunning within the next 15 minutes or\nwhatever.\n\n313\n00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,380\nI just jump into my AWS console,\nspin up the servers, get it up and\n\n314\n00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,360\nrunning, and now all I gotta worry\nabout is actually doing my development,\n\n315\n00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,380\ngetting my code running.\n\n316\n00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,190\nAnd that makes it easy for them.\n\n317\n00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,990\nThey don't have to be sys admins.\n\n318\n00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,265\nThey can just be dev guys and not have to\nworry about using that kind of technology.\n\n319\n00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,460\nAnd we make it sound simple,\nI wanna show you guys an example so\n\n320\n00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,390\nyou can see how simple this really is.\n\n321\n00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,140\nSo lets use that example of a developer\nwho's written a Ruby application,\n\n322\n00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,940\nRuby on rails, and they've got\nthe application fully written, and\n\n323\n00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,800\nthey're ready to put it\nout there on the internet.\n\n324\n00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,370\nWell they could go to a service like here.\n\n325\n00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,130\nI'm on Amazon web services, and\nI'm gonna use their elastic\n\n326\n00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,480\nbeanstalk service right down here\nunder deployment and management.\n\n327\n00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,190\nIf I go to Elastic Beanstalk, I can\ntell it that I'm going to fire up a new\n\n328\n00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,180\napplication, and when I do that,\nthey ask me what platform I want.\n\n329\n00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,480\nThis is platform as a service.\n\n330\n00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,260\nSo I'm gonna look in here and\nhere's Ruby, right?\n\n331\n00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,950\nIf I had PHP or Node.js, Python, right,any\nof those other guys I could choose them.\n\n332\n00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,500\nI'm gonna choose Ruby.\n\n333\n00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,340\nI'm telling them I've got a Ruby\napplication that I wanna host, and\n\n334\n00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,730\nthey tell me they're gonna spin\nup a 64-bit Amazon Linux image.\n\n335\n00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,050\nBut I don't care about that cuz\nthey're gonna manage it, right?\n\n336\n00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,220\nSo they're gonna take care of\nsetting hardware for me and the OS.\n\n337\n00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,550\nAnd they're gonna make it ready for Ruby.\n\n338\n00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,210\nAnd I can launch that.\n\n339\n00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,883\nIt's gonna build that platform in the\nbackground and it takes just a moment for\n\n340\n00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:43,729\nit to build that.\n\n341\n00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,549\nWhat it's doing is it's\nprovisioning hardware,\n\n342\n00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,702\nit's provisioning memory and\ndisk space for my server.\n\n343\n00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:51,909\nThen it's provisioning\nthe operating system,\n\n344\n00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,342\nthat Amazon Linux, and\nit's putting that in place.\n\n345\n00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:59,508\nThen it's configuring Apache as my web\nserver, and it's adding the Ruby libraries\n\n346\n00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:04,670\nto it, and it's getting all of that\nconfigured and enabled and set to scale.\n\n347\n00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,020\nSo this can dynamically grow as I\nthrow more users into the system.\n\n348\n00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,240\nAnd it's doing all of that for me.\n\n349\n00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,630\nAnd when it's done, this little buttons\ngoing to light up here, upload and deploy.\n\n350\n00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,040\nAnd I just hit upload and I pick I take\nmy Ruby application I zip it up into\n\n351\n00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,590\nan archive and I upload it right here and\nthey install it for me.\n\n352\n00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,640\nIts my application but they install it,\nit goes on the server and it's done.\n\n353\n00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,170\nAll I had to do was upload that.\n\n354\n00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,840\nI never even saw a single Linux screen.\n\n355\n00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,560\nI never had to pick RAM or hard drive\nspace, all of that's insulated and\n\n356\n00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,310\ntaken care of they provide\nthe platform and the manage it.\n\n357\n00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,690\nI know its running Amazon Linux\nin the background.\n\n358\n00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,300\nIf an exploit is found and\nan update comes out they patch it,\n\n359\n00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,870\nits patched its done I don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n360\n00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,930\nFor example there was that heart\nbleed SSL exploit a few months ago,\n\n361\n00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,830\nAmazon patched it.\n\n362\n00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,150\nDone.\nGone.\n\n363\n00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,640\nIf you ran your own servers,\nlike with Amazon EC2, you had to go and\n\n364\n00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,220\napply the patch.\n\n365\n00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,720\nBut with platform as a service,\nlike Elastic Beanstalk, they do it.\n\n366\n00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,060\nThey do it, knocks it out and it's done.\n\n367\n00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,955\nNow, it does take a little\nwhile to build this up.\n\n368\n00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:10,345\nAnd if you've worked with AWS you might\nknow that if you spin up your own server\n\n369\n00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,405\nit's up within seconds.\n\n370\n00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,865\nThis one takes longer though\nbecause it's having to do more.\n\n371\n00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,710\nRight?\nIt's having to configure the underlying\n\n372\n00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,778\nOS, it's having to take care of things\nthat normally would be left up to you,\n\n373\n00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:20,501\nthey're doing.\n\n374\n00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:26,950\nAnd when it's done you've now got\na platform and you're ready to rock.\n\n375\n00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,920\n>> It's funny you say it takes longer,\n\n376\n00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,140\nwhen we say longer we make more than the\ntwo minutes it takes for you to actually\n\n377\n00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,100\ngo in there create your own virtual\nserver instance, whatever they call it.\n\n378\n00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,040\nIn AWS, we're talking 10 minutes,\n15 minutes, and you're rocking.\n\n379\n00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,111\nWhereas before you'd have to\nget out your ISOs, pop them in,\n\n380\n00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:48,265\nmake sure to get Windows installed or get\nLinux installed, then install the Ruby.\n\n381\n00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:50,825\nIt would take you forever to do that.\n\n382\n00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,775\n>> If you already had the hardware\nit would take you an hour.\n\n383\n00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,256\n>> Yeah, easily.\n>> If you didn't have the hardware\n\n384\n00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,747\nyou have to get a quote,\nyou have to order to the server,\n\n385\n00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:59,195\nyou'd have to wait two weeks for\nthe server to come in.\n\n386\n00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,015\nYou'd get your OS installed and\n\n387\n00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:05,830\nall that it would be at least a two week\nprocess to get that kind of thing up.\n\n388\n00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,240\nIt is far, far quicker.\n\n389\n00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,840\nIt's like the microwave oven, sometimes\nwe think the microwave takes too long but\n\n390\n00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,730\nyou got a real oven right beside it and\nit takes-\n\n391\n00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,910\n>> Yeah, the half hour wait for\n\n392\n00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,532\nthe pot pie versus the ten minutes or\nfive minutes.\n\n393\n00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,840\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh pot pies, yes.\n\n394\n00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,360\nAnd take it all comes\nback to rapid eating.\n\n395\n00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,520\nSo that's platform as a service or PaaS.\n\n396\n00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:33,990\nThe last one Is probably the coolest,\nSoftware as a Service, SaaS.\n\n397\n00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,900\nWith SaaS, this is where we say, you know\nwhat, I wanna get my data in the cloud and\n\n398\n00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,700\nI totally don't wanna deal with anything.\n\n399\n00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,790\nI don't wanna deal with the hardware,\nI don't wanna deal with the operating\n\n400\n00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,500\nsystem, and I don't wanna deal\nwith the software either.\n\n401\n00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,150\nI want everything, 100% of it, outsourced\nI just need a product that I can use,\n\n402\n00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,530\nall right?\n\n403\n00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,780\nWell, unfortunately every company\nhas different needs, and so\n\n404\n00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,420\nthe odds are whatever\nproduct it is that you use,\n\n405\n00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,640\nyou're not gonna be able to\nget a software as a service.\n\n406\n00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,423\nBut if you need a generic product,\nsomething like e-mail service, or CRM,\n\n407\n00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:11,220\na website, file storage, things like that,\nyou can get that as software as a storage.\n\n408\n00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,800\nAll right, or software as a service,\nthere we go, not a storage.\n\n409\n00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,340\nI'm thinking storage in my head.\n\n410\n00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,830\nFor example,\nif I wanna give you a file, Daniel, so\n\n411\n00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,070\nI wanna send a file across\nthe internet to Daniel.\n\n412\n00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,600\nHow can I do that?\n\n413\n00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,200\nI could stick it on e-mail,\nthat's evil, you shouldn't do that.\n\n414\n00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,760\nI can bring up my own FTP server and\nyou could FTP it.\n\n415\n00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720\nI could do things like that,\nor I could go to Dropbox.\n\n416\n00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160\nI could sign up for a Dropbox account,\nI could put my file there,\n\n417\n00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,260\nDaniel could go and\ndownload it from Dropbox.\n\n418\n00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,920\nDropbox is providing storage and transfer\nsoftware that's completely hosted by them.\n\n419\n00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,810\nI don't have to install\nanything on my computer,\n\n420\n00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,720\nI can just use a web browser,\nupload a file.\n\n421\n00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,070\nHe can download it to his web browser and\nthat's it.\n\n422\n00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,870\nAll the software is managed by them.\n\n423\n00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,690\nI have no idea what hardware\nthe guys at Dropbox have.\n\n424\n00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,540\nI have no idea what operating\nsystem they run, no clue.\n\n425\n00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,100\nI don't even know if it's Linux or\nWindows, I don't know cuz I don't have to.\n\n426\n00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,140\nThey provide that whole software.\n\n427\n00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,830\nGmail, if you need email or\nan email server, in the past,\n\n428\n00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,660\nyou had to spin up a Linux box and\nset up sendmail.\n\n429\n00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,890\nOr spin up and Windows box,\na Microsoft Exchange or whatever.\n\n430\n00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,830\nIt was a lot to do.\n\n431\n00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,810\nWell if I use outlook.com or Gmail,\nthey provide the mail server and\n\n432\n00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,530\nthe mail client,\nall software as a service.\n\n433\n00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,990\nI just log in a and I see my inbox..\n\n434\n00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,130\nI don't know what OS it's running.\n\n435\n00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,630\nWith Gmail, heck, I don't even\nknow what mail server they run.\n\n436\n00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,990\nThey It might have made something\ninternally, do you know?\n\n437\n00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,825\n>> I have no clue what they're running.\n\n438\n00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,142\n[LAUGH]\n>> But works great, doesn't it?\n\n439\n00:20:35,142 --> 00:20:35,820\n>> Fantastic.\n[LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,990\n>> And you pay them,\n\n441\n00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,710\nand I don't worry about backing\nup my mailbox because they do.\n\n442\n00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,770\nIf they have a server failure,\nthey got a backup, they restore it.\n\n443\n00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,270\nIt's happened multiple times\nwhere Google's lost service but\n\n444\n00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,129\nthey restored the backups.\n\n445\n00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,480\nAs far as what protocols are you using and\nstuff, I don't know.\n\n446\n00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,910\nI don't know and I don't wanna know.\n\n447\n00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,190\nThey deal with it.\n\n448\n00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,950\nNow, of the three platforms, or\nthe service types we've talked about,\n\n449\n00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,520\nsoftware as a service is\nusually the most expensive.\n\n450\n00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,310\nSo you're using like mailboxes.\n\n451\n00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,450\nIf I want Google Apps for\nbusiness or Google Apps for work,\n\n452\n00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,920\nit's something like $6 or\n$5 per month per user.\n\n453\n00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,790\nThat adds up pretty fast, right?\n\n454\n00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,990\nOr if you want Dropbox for\nbusiness it adds up.\n\n455\n00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,870\nSo there's a higher cost.\n\n456\n00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,850\nBut what are you getting for that cost?\n\n457\n00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,630\nThat all the servers are 100% completely\nmanaged, you don't worry about anything.\n\n458\n00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,129\nNo backups, no software updates,\nno redundant power,\n\n459\n00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:32,660\nno electricity bill,\nno staff monitoring it 24/7.\n\n460\n00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,640\nIf a problem happens, no scrambling and\nrushing into the office at 2 AM.\n\n461\n00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,560\nThey deal with all of that and\nand is that worth it?\n\n462\n00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,530\nIn a lot of cases it is, right?\n\n463\n00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,250\nThe other big advantage\nto software as a service,\n\n464\n00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,200\nlet me show you here on a diagram,\n\n465\n00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,600\nis that because all of the service\nis being managed externally.\n\n466\n00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,430\nIt doesn't matter if\nyou're on your laptop at\n\n467\n00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,470\nhome on your desktop at the office\nyou're anywhere in the world,\n\n468\n00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,050\nyou have access to this application cuz\nit's all hosted in the cloud, right?\n\n469\n00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,530\nSo you've now created this ability to\nhave a mobile workforce if you want,\n\n470\n00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,540\nversus if the servers\nwere in your own office.\n\n471\n00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,260\nPeople would be tethered to the office or\nthey'd have to use VPN technologies.\n\n472\n00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,610\nYou'd have to have hardware for that.\n\n473\n00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,710\nAnd if your internet connection\nwent down at your home office,\n\n474\n00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,210\neverybody was dead in the water.\n\n475\n00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,580\nBut here, they can go home,\nthey can go to a hotel,\n\n476\n00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,760\nanywhere they can get internet access.\n\n477\n00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,330\nAnd they can get into that software.\n\n478\n00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,040\nThat's very powerful.\n\n479\n00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,200\nCompanies like, I mentioned Gmail and\nthose guys, but\n\n480\n00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,830\nlike, www.salesforce.com,\nwhich is a web based CRM for\n\n481\n00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,050\nmanaging customers and contacts,\nthey are just killing it out there.\n\n482\n00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,590\nI think they recently got acquired\nby Microsoft, didn't they?\n\n483\n00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,698\n>> Did they?\n>> I'm pretty certain.\n\n484\n00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:36,385\nSo [CROSSTALK].\n\n485\n00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:38,080\n>> It wasn't all right then.\n\n486\n00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,275\n>> Unless that's not out there,\nin which case, I'll admit.\n\n487\n00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know they're killing it.\n\n488\n00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,870\nIt is an entirely web based service.\n\n489\n00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,320\nNow you can have a mobile sales force,\n\n490\n00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,090\nyou can have sales people all over\nthe world all accessing the same database.\n\n491\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,670\nBut you don't even see that,\nthat's all just transparent.\n\n492\n00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,910\nSoftware as a service is the most\npowerful of the consolations.\n\n493\n00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,920\nBut it's also the least flexible.\n\n494\n00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,850\nFor example, if Salesforce.com,\n\n495\n00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,140\nif it doesn't have a feature that I want,\ncan I go and implement that feature?\n\n496\n00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,980\nNo, I have to hope that\nthey will implement it, and\n\n497\n00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,820\nthey're pretty responsive.\n\n498\n00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,760\nBut Gmail, if I really want that feature\nin Gmail, is Google gonna do it?\n\n499\n00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,452\nThey don't,\nthey don't listen to their customers.\n\n500\n00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,430\nSo [LAUGH], so\nI'm never going to get that feature.\n\n501\n00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,640\nI've given up control, right?\n\n502\n00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,390\nThat's the thing with\nsoftware as a service,\n\n503\n00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,310\nyou've given up 100% of your control.\n\n504\n00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,170\nYou're at the whim of that provider, or\nyou switch to a different provider, right?\n\n505\n00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,410\nWith platform as a service,\nyou control your software but\n\n506\n00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,970\nyou've given up control of\nthe operating system and the hardware.\n\n507\n00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,740\nAnd with infrastructure as a service,\nyou control the software and\n\n508\n00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,890\nthe operating system.\n\n509\n00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,390\nYou've given up control of the hardware.\n\n510\n00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,386\nAnd that means that infrastructure\nas a service is the lowest risk.\n\n511\n00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:47,860\nAnd that's where people normally kind\nof enter into the cloud space, and\n\n512\n00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,839\nthen they start moving up to the others as\nthey leverage the various technologies and\n\n513\n00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,494\nfind that they can really be\nsome big benefits in there.\n\n514\n00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,355\n>> Yeah, and\nit seems like that makes sense, you know?\n\n515\n00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:57,590\nTo go ahead and say.\n\n516\n00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,732\nWell, this isn't mission-critical stuff, I\ncan start just putting some servers here,\n\n517\n00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,760\nmaybe some network equipment there,\ncreating those links.\n\n518\n00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,510\nAnd then, as you become more\ncomfortable with that type of service,\n\n519\n00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,700\nthen you start moving\nother things as well.\n\n520\n00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,998\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n521\n00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:14,630\nSo when your CIO comes storming into your\noffice saying, hey I just read this Forbes\n\n522\n00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,150\narticle and we gotta get our stuff in\nthe cloud, you can say, well, all right.\n\n523\n00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,740\nWhat is it we're trying to achieve?\n\n524\n00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,490\nAre you tired of having to\ndeal with the hardware and\n\n525\n00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,240\nthe materials cost of running an IT\ndepartment and we wanna outsource that?\n\n526\n00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,170\nOr is it that you're tired of\nexploits in your host OSs and\n\n527\n00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,070\nyou'd rather that be pushed out and\nmanaged by somebody else?\n\n528\n00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,780\nOr are you looking to eliminate a large\nportion of your IT staff or just get\n\n529\n00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,650\na more reliable software deployment and\nmove to software as a service?\n\n530\n00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,670\nYou know, what is it you're trying\nto achieve, what's your goal?\n\n531\n00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,900\nAnd then they can look at you and they\ncan say, well, you know I hadn't thought\n\n532\n00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,850\nabout it but really the biggest problem\nthat we're facing right now is that we\n\n533\n00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,530\nhave hard drive failures and I've only got\nso much staff It's hard to get somebody to\n\n534\n00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,840\ncome in and replace those drives,\nor whatever at 2 AM.\n\n535\n00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,620\nI just need that to go away.\n\n536\n00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620\nAnd now we know, we need to look for\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n537\n00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,520\nOr they say, look,\nwe've got this CRM software, and\n\n538\n00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,860\nit works great enough, but\nwe've had so many outages this year.\n\n539\n00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,610\nI'd rather we didn't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n540\n00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,300\nOr, SharePoint's a great example.\n\n541\n00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,280\nThey say, I've got Microsoft SharePoint,\nand the site works, but man, is it slow,\n\n542\n00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,730\nand nobody here knows how\nto tune the software right.\n\n543\n00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,720\nI really wish we had somebody who\nknew what they were doing running\n\n544\n00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,360\nour SharePoint server.\n\n545\n00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,150\nJust on a personal note,\n\n546\n00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,060\nyou do need to know what you're doing if\nyou set up your own SharePoint server.\n\n547\n00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,538\nThey're tough to tune.\n\n548\n00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:32,100\nSo we say, all right, what we really\nneed there is software as a service.\n\n549\n00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,790\nWe need to go to Microsoft and\ndo Office 365, and\n\n550\n00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,020\nthey'll host our SharePoint server for us.\n\n551\n00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,230\nNow we know it's tuned right because the\nguys who wrote the software are hosting it\n\n552\n00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,260\nfor us and it's up,\nit's running, it's smooth.\n\n553\n00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,850\nWe don't have to worry about it anymore.\n\n554\n00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,550\nSo you find out a little more information\nfrom the CIO, you provide the solution\n\n555\n00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,370\nthat they need, and now you move forward\nand take advantage of the cloud.\n\n556\n00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,710\nSo let's recap those just\nreal quick before we wrap up.\n\n557\n00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,490\nInfrastructure is the service.\n\n558\n00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,600\nThat's where they take the hardware.\n\n559\n00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,880\nThey're responsible for the hardware,\nyou deal with OS in software.\n\n560\n00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,080\nThen platform is a service.\n\n561\n00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,720\nThey provide the hardware and the OS.\n\n562\n00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,400\nYou're just responsible for\nthe software, the application.\n\n563\n00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,230\nAnd then software as a service, they\nprovide the whole thing, the hardware,\n\n564\n00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,990\nthe OS, and the software.\n\n565\n00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,770\nYou just consume it.\n\n566\n00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,160\nYou just use the software and\nbe happy, smile,\n\n567\n00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,655\nand fire half your IT staff or whatever.\n\n568\n00:26:23,655 --> 00:26:25,365\n>> [LAUGH] Layoffs for everyone.\n\n569\n00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,110\n>> [LAUGH] Not necessarily.\n\n570\n00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,290\nIt does sound negative sometimes, but with\nsoftware as a service it might be that\n\n571\n00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,880\nthere's just one particular software\npackage that you're outsourcing and\n\n572\n00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,130\nyou have plenty of other\nsoftware you maintain internally.\n\n573\n00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,910\nIt's up to you how you\nwanna implement that.\n\n574\n00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,510\nMany people do actually use\nit though to reduce IT staff.\n\n575\n00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,100\n>> Yes.\n\n576\n00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,000\nIt is an option, that is true.\n\n577\n00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,570\nThat being said, Don, I think that\nwe have covered this pretty well.\n\n578\n00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,820\nVery informative stuff,\nand thank you for that.\n\n579\n00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,400\nHope you guys out there watching\nthis really got a lot out of it,\n\n580\n00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,550\nI know I sure did.\n\n581\n00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,260\nThat being said I think we've come\nto the end of another episode.\n\n582\n00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,870\nSo for ITProTV, signing off,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n583\n00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,590\nAnd I'm Don Pezet.\n\n584\n00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,813\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n585\n00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:05,730\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:16,710\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,700\nHere with me today is Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,940\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,880\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,250\nGlad to be back on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,920\nAnd we got a neat show up ahead of us.\n\n10\n00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,794\nBecause what we're going to do today is\nanswer one of the one of the big questions\n\n11\n00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:29,832\nthat I get a lot.\n\n12\n00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:32,990\nWhich is Don, why should I even\nbother with this whole cloud mess?\n\n13\n00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,440\nI've got servers at my office,\n\n14\n00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,560\nthey run fine,\neverything does what I need it to do.\n\n15\n00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,882\nDo I even need to bother with the cloud?\n\n16\n00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:44,072\nSo, in this episode we're not\ngonna give you one reason.\n\n17\n00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:45,613\nWe're not gonna give you two reasons.\n\n18\n00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:50,140\nWe're gonna give you ten reasons\nwhy you should be using the cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,360\nThis'll be like a Dave Waterman\ntop ten list or whatever.\n\n20\n00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,506\n>> You gonna throw in a set of\nGinsu knives with that, afterwards?\n\n21\n00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:58,680\n>> [LAUGH] But wait,\nthere's more, order now.\n\n22\n00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,804\nOffer expires while you wait.\n\n23\n00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:00,868\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,045\n>> So, what we're gonna do,\n\n25\n00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,260\nis we're gonna run through\nten cloud strategies.\n\n26\n00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,079\nThese are different ways that we can\ntake advantage of the cloud to really\n\n27\n00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,152\nmake it work for us.\n\n28\n00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,347\nThere's certain things that the cloud\noffers that a lot of us just can't do.\n\n29\n00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:17,252\nYou can't do it because you don't have the\nstaff, or you don't have the the money,\n\n30\n00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:18,080\nin a lot of cases.\n\n31\n00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,798\nI mean, these cloud vendors,\nthey got a ton of money,\n\n32\n00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,708\nso there's things they can do\nthat we can't possibly do.\n\n33\n00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,270\nAnd those are the things that\nshould be take advantage of.\n\n34\n00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,340\nWe should be using what\nthey have to offer.\n\n35\n00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,580\nSo, without further ado,\nlet's start with number one.\n\n36\n00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,820\nMy number one reason we should be\nusing the cloud is simply, redundancy.\n\n37\n00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,625\nRedundancy.\n\n38\n00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,055\nWhen you talk about a network.\n\n39\n00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,165\nIf one device fails,\nyou've gotta to go and fix it.\n\n40\n00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,825\nYou've gotta replace it and\nas long as it's down,\n\n41\n00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:47,395\nyou've got users who might\nnot be able to function.\n\n42\n00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:50,715\nSo, we need redundancy from the cloud and\n\n43\n00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:53,355\nthat's something these cloud\nproviders do really well.\n\n44\n00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,295\nLet me show you an example.\n\n45\n00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:57,105\nI've got some slides from a tour\nthat Microsoft released from one of\n\n46\n00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:58,195\nthe Azure data centers.\n\n47\n00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,442\nSo, I've got it right here.\n\n48\n00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:02,470\nAnd when I talk about redundancy.\n\n49\n00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,670\nTo me I'm like, well, if I have one hard\ndrive I should have two hard drives.\n\n50\n00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,770\nThat's redundancy.\n\n51\n00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,412\nMicrosoft says, why have one server,\nwhen you can have a thousand?\n\n52\n00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:14,990\n[LAUGH] And so you end up with these\ndata centers with tons of servers.\n\n53\n00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,050\nIf one server fails,\nyou don't even notice,\n\n54\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,300\ncuz there's 999 more right there in\nthat same wall right alongside them.\n\n55\n00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,460\nAnd what we're looking at here\nis inside of a container.\n\n56\n00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,812\nWhy deploy one of those containers\nwhen you can deploy 20 of the things?\n\n57\n00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:30,340\nWe're talking about 2400\nsevers per container.\n\n58\n00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,450\nThere's at least 10 containers right here.\n\n59\n00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,150\nThere's tens of thousands of servers.\n\n60\n00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,750\nWhy have one chiller cooling the air for\nyour service, when you could have two, or\n\n61\n00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,060\nthree, or four?\n\n62\n00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,950\nWhy, whoop, that's not what I wanted.\n\n63\n00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,133\nWe'll jump around slides.\n\n64\n00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,256\nWhy have one generator,\nwhen you could have two?\n\n65\n00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,395\nAnd this doesn't show it,\n\n66\n00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:50,030\nbut there's actually two more\nback off the edge of this slide.\n\n67\n00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,950\nIf you take the actual\ntour on Microsoft's site,\n\n68\n00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,360\nyou'll see the other ones in the picture.\n\n69\n00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,040\nWhy have one or two backup batteries\nwhen you could have 1,000?\n\n70\n00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,600\nWhy have one main UPS unit\nwhen you can have multiple?\n\n71\n00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,692\nThis is what they do.\n\n72\n00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:07,590\nThis is the redundancy that you get\nwhen you go with a cloud provider.\n\n73\n00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,790\nSomebody like Amazon EC2, Rackspace,\nMicrosoft Azure, these guys.\n\n74\n00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,322\nThey handle so many servers.\n\n75\n00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:15,850\nThey have so\n\n76\n00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,610\nmuch redundancy that's well beyond what\nmost companies could even fathom doing.\n\n77\n00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,240\nThey've already done it cuz they\nneeded it for themselves anyway.\n\n78\n00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,510\nAnd now you can take advantage of it.\n\n79\n00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,790\nSo, reason number one Redundancy.\n\n80\n00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,011\n>> And this isn't Jimmy's\nbargain bin stuff either.\n\n81\n00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:32,389\nThis is, like, top of the line equipment,\nbest stuff on the market, and\n\n82\n00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,874\nthey stay on top of that as well.\n\n83\n00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,960\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n84\n00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,920\nReason number two is going\nto be rapid provisioning.\n\n85\n00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,810\nIf I need a new server.\n\n86\n00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,731\nWell, I can go to Dell's web site and\nI can buy one.\n\n87\n00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,038\nLike if I jump over to.\n\n88\n00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,310\nLet's see,\ndo I have web browser open here somewhere?\n\n89\n00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,150\nSure I do.\n\n90\n00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,930\nIf I go to Dell's web site and\nI go to buy a server, I can do that.\n\n91\n00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,692\nI can go and\npick the components that I need.\n\n92\n00:03:56,692 --> 00:04:00,010\nAnd we did this on another show, so\nI'm not gonna waste too much time on it.\n\n93\n00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,120\nBut picking all the little options and\nstuff, it gets a little crazy.\n\n94\n00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,584\nAnd then when you do finally\npick the server that you want,\n\n95\n00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,781\nit takes five to seven days to get it.\n\n96\n00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,264\nSo, if my CIO walks in here today and\nsays Don,\n\n97\n00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,710\nwe need a new web server up right now.\n\n98\n00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,590\nI'm gonna say all right, well,\nlet me go spec a server out and\n\n99\n00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,340\nfind how much it costs.\n\n100\n00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,480\nLet me go and\ntake that to the accounting division or\n\n101\n00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,110\nwhatever and get the funds approved.\n\n102\n00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,300\nLet me get a purchase order.\n\n103\n00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,710\nLet me send it to Dell.\n\n104\n00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,530\nAnd then once Dell gets all that,\nships in five to seven business days.\n\n105\n00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,770\nNow, that's ships in five\nto seven business days.\n\n106\n00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,820\nThat's not counting the shipping\ntime on top of that.\n\n107\n00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,410\nSo, it's probably gonna take me about\ntwo weeks to get that new server in.\n\n108\n00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,100\nBut with a cloud service, I just just\nlog-in to my cloud management portal and\n\n109\n00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,670\nI tell it I need a new service.\n\n110\n00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,030\nSo, maybe I go into.\n\n111\n00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,540\nHere, we'll jump over to Amazon.\n\n112\n00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,410\nSo, I jump over to Amazon, I go to EC2,\nI tell it I need a new instance.\n\n113\n00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,770\nI'll launch an instance, I tell it\nI want Linux or Windows or Red Hat.\n\n114\n00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,710\nI'll say Linux and\nthen I pick my hardware.\n\n115\n00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,930\nWell, I need four processors and\n15 gigs of RAM.\n\n116\n00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,340\nHook me up.\n\n117\n00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,930\nAnd then I hit Review and\nLaunch, and Launch.\n\n118\n00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,990\nI do have to pick a key pair.\n\n119\n00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,130\nSo, at least I guess I have to do that,\nbut I've already got one so\n\n120\n00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,870\nthat makes that nice and fast.\n\n121\n00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,700\nAnd pow.\n\n122\n00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,280\nNow I got a server.\n\n123\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,960\nAnd now I'm just going to get billed for\nthat while I use it.\n\n124\n00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,670\nI didn't have to do anything\ncrazy to get this done.\n\n125\n00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,950\nI didn't have to wait two weeks for\nit to ship.\n\n126\n00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,210\nAnd better yet, I know that it was\ndeployed on that redundant network we just\n\n127\n00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,490\nsaw a minute ago.\n\n128\n00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,220\nThis is a pretty sweet implementation.\n\n129\n00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,051\n>> Yeah, that's the way to fly\nright there if you have the means.\n\n130\n00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:33,668\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you make use of this stuff,\n\n131\n00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,920\nabsolutely that's the way to do it.\n\n132\n00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,650\nIt's up in place.\n\n133\n00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,320\nI can see I've got that running instance.\n\n134\n00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,760\nIt's booting up right now, and\nit says it's initializing, but\n\n135\n00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,370\nwithin about two minutes, that server's\nup, running and ready to rock.\n\n136\n00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,820\n>> Yeah,\nnormally that would take us hours.\n\n137\n00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,200\nOnce that server actually gets here,\nthen you gotta rack the thing,\n\n138\n00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,520\nyou gotta put the operating system on it,\nany other software it needs.\n\n139\n00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,670\nDon't forget the updates.\n\n140\n00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,900\nAnti viruses, as well.\n\n141\n00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,260\nAnd you're off to the races.\n\n142\n00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,550\nThat was a whole lot faster.\n\n143\n00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,875\n>> All right, item number three.\n\n144\n00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,170\nAvailability.\n\n145\n00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,610\nWhen you bring up a server, if you buy\nthe cheapest server on the planet, it's\n\n146\n00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,100\nprobably going to fail or have a shorter\nmean time between failure, the old MTBF.\n\n147\n00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,730\nAnd so you'll have an outage.\n\n148\n00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,620\nIf you buy really expensive high end\nserver, it'll probably go longer\n\n149\n00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,140\nwithout a failure, but\nyou spent a lot of money for it.\n\n150\n00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,610\nWell, when you sign up\nwith a cloud provider,\n\n151\n00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,210\nthey're offering you\nservice level agreements.\n\n152\n00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,760\nSo, for example, here is Rackspace.\n\n153\n00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,760\nIf you go and rent servers from Rackspace,\n\n154\n00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,840\nthese are the service level agreements\nthey offer and they tell you, for example,\n\n155\n00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,850\non power, that they will always have\nredundant power on their system and\n\n156\n00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,500\nthey will always have redundant air\nconditioning and heating and so on.\n\n157\n00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,620\nAnd they lay all that out\nright here if you sign up.\n\n158\n00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,950\nThey have a 100% network\nup time guarantee.\n\n159\n00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,630\nThat means they feel their network is so\nredundant, that there would have to be so\n\n160\n00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,050\nmany failures for\nthat network to actually go out,\n\n161\n00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,420\nthat they don't think it's gonna happen.\n\n162\n00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,200\nSo, they'll offer you 100%.\n\n163\n00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,540\nAnd then they have certain offsets or\n\n164\n00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,330\nwhatever they pay if they\nwere ever to not have that.\n\n165\n00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,010\nThese are our service level\nagreements they guarantee.\n\n166\n00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,610\nThey're telling us, right here, that we'll\nmake sure that you get a certain level of\n\n167\n00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,980\naccess that everything is protected.\n\n168\n00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,260\nIt says networks will be\navailable 100% of the time.\n\n169\n00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,230\nHVAC, that's heating, ventilation,\nand air conditioning.\n\n170\n00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,160\nSo our AC will be going 100% of the time,\nas well as power.\n\n171\n00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,430\nAnd then, hardware components\nwill function correctly,\n\n172\n00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,980\nor we'll replace them at no cost to you.\n\n173\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,950\nThey're guaranteeing that service.\n\n174\n00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,410\nYour servers will be available.\n\n175\n00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,850\nAnd if they're ever not,\nthey're dealing with it.\n\n176\n00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,000\nSo if, at 2 AM, the server fails.\n\n177\n00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,360\nThey're the ones who are going to go\nin and fix that and get it back up and\n\n178\n00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,260\ngoing, from a hardware perspective.\n\n179\n00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,000\nYou can still break it, software wise,\nif you really wanted to.\n\n180\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,898\nBut on the hardware side,\nit's taken care of.\n\n181\n00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,790\nSo, they're gonna give you\ntop notch availability so\n\n182\n00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,820\nthat you don't have to worry about it.\n\n183\n00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,870\nItem number four, infrastructure.\n\n184\n00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,961\nThe infrastructure, we've kind of already\nseen a little bit when I showed those\n\n185\n00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,330\nslides the Microsoft data center.\n\n186\n00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,030\nThese guys.\n\n187\n00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,170\nThey've got money.\n\n188\n00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,827\nThey've got skills, they've got\nthe teams to be able to build out\n\n189\n00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:10,420\ninfrastructure in data centers that are\nbeyond what most organizations could do.\n\n190\n00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,540\nAll right, the pictures I showed you a\nmoment ago were from a slideshow tour that\n\n191\n00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,120\nMicrosoft released of one of\ntheir Azure data centers.\n\n192\n00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,200\nThis is a slide show tour that Rackspace\nreleased of one of their data centers.\n\n193\n00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,950\nNow, I can't show you my own pictures\nbecause they won't let me take them.\n\n194\n00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,800\nThese guys they have high security\nenvironments, they won't let you in there,\n\n195\n00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,740\nso we're kind of tied of these\npress images that they release.\n\n196\n00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,730\nBut this is one of Rackspace's data\ncenters and you see rack after rack of\n\n197\n00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,180\nservers and see how nice and neat they\nare, how those cables are all beautiful?\n\n198\n00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,030\nThey almost brings a tear\nto a Systadmin's eyes.\n\n199\n00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,360\nIt's hard to maintain something\nlike this on your own.\n\n200\n00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,010\nBut it's not just that I mean, look at\nthese cable racks they've installed,\n\n201\n00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,500\nthe runs that they do,\nthe multiple network links,\n\n202\n00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,038\nthe switches in every single\nrack containing those servers.\n\n203\n00:08:54,038 --> 00:09:00,870\nAnd it goes beyond my ability\nto control this, apparently.\n\n204\n00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,810\nTo contain things like,\nyou know, our electric.\n\n205\n00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,180\nHere, we kinda see some more of that\nbefore based cooling that's coming up\n\n206\n00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,410\nthe sub-floors.\n\n207\n00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,620\nThis is all the infrastructure\nthat you're paying for.\n\n208\n00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,240\nI mean, you know?\n\n209\n00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,920\nJust the chilling and\nUPS units that are in place.\n\n210\n00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,310\nWell, these are the chillers right\nhere that keep the air cool.\n\n211\n00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,930\nAll of this stuff.\n\n212\n00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,940\nIt cost some money.\n\n213\n00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,160\nIt's expensive and you've got to have\npeople with the know how to implement it.\n\n214\n00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,320\nNot every company has that.\n\n215\n00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,750\nIf you're a small or medium sized company,\n\n216\n00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,600\nyou couldn't possibly\nafford that level of staff.\n\n217\n00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,280\nThey're going be working for\ncloud providers like these.\n\n218\n00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,310\nSo when we sign up with\nthe cloud provider and\n\n219\n00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,630\nput our servers there we get this,\nit's like we had this for\n\n220\n00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,750\nour own data center even though we\nwouldn't be able to afford that ourselves.\n\n221\n00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,820\nThat's a great reason to\ntake advantage of this.\n\n222\n00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,616\nSo, infrastructure they've got\ntop notch stuff you can use.\n\n223\n00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:51,165\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,100\nNumber five.\n\n225\n00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,910\nNumber five it should\nprobably be like number one\n\n226\n00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,240\nif we were doing these in order.\n\n227\n00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,110\nBut number five is one of my favorites.\n\n228\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,010\nIt's auto scaling.\n\n229\n00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,670\nNow, you might have a website and\nactually I've got a little diagram I did.\n\n230\n00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,720\nIt's one of my amazing diagrams.\n\n231\n00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,910\nI have terrible diagrams.\n\n232\n00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,710\nYou might have a website.\n\n233\n00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,920\nAnd most websites don't have like, a flat\nline of utilization throughout the day.\n\n234\n00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,160\nYou don't have 100 visitors all\nthe time throughout the day.\n\n235\n00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,580\nInstead, you have peaks and valleys.\n\n236\n00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,450\nThere's times where your\nwebsite's really busy and\n\n237\n00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,580\nthere's times where your\nwebsite's really weak.\n\n238\n00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,270\nAnd so when we build out a web farm,\n\n239\n00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,990\nwe look at what our average utilization is\ngonna be, or what our peak utilization is.\n\n240\n00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,810\nAnd we say, all right,\nour peak utilization,\n\n241\n00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,520\nwe have to have enough server\nhardware to handle the peak.\n\n242\n00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,740\nIf we don't, if we only have enough to\nhandle like our average way down here,\n\n243\n00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,670\nthen when it hits a peak, the website gets\nslow and our users have a bad experience.\n\n244\n00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,140\nSome users don't get a webpage at all.\n\n245\n00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,300\nSo when we build that type of a web farm.\n\n246\n00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,370\nIf it takes ten servers to cover peak,\nI've got to have ten servers, but\n\n247\n00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,310\nwhen things slow down like in one of\nthese valleys, I still have ten servers.\n\n248\n00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,300\nI have to have ten servers,\nI need that to cover my peak times, but\n\n249\n00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,050\nin these times, I'm wasting no servers.\n\n250\n00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,761\nWith cloud providers we\ncan do auto-scaling, and\n\n251\n00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:11,850\nwith auto-scaling, if I need ten\nservers at peak time I get them.\n\n252\n00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,590\nBut in a valley I can drop down to two\nservers, and as it starts ramping up,\n\n253\n00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,210\nI can go back up to seven,\nand up to ten, and\n\n254\n00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,090\nback down to seven I can fluctuate\nthe amount of servers that I have.\n\n255\n00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,740\nAnd all of the Cloud providers,\nMicrosoft Azure,\n\n256\n00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,760\nAmazon EC2, Rackspace,\nall those guys, they charge per hour.\n\n257\n00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,670\nSo when you spin up a server,\nyou only pay for the time that you need.\n\n258\n00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,210\nIf you shut a server down,\nyou're not paying for it anymore.\n\n259\n00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,110\nThat's a huge improvement over\nthis model where I had to pay for\n\n260\n00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,940\nthe service up front.\n\n261\n00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,270\nFirst off, right, you gotta pay for\nthem up front and\n\n262\n00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,310\nthen you just got them all the time\nwhether they use them or not.\n\n263\n00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,550\nHere I pay for these servers\nas I use them, I pay as I go.\n\n264\n00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,160\nI don't have to pay up front and\nI only pay for what I need.\n\n265\n00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,400\nAuto scaling is what the facilicates.\n\n266\n00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,260\nCan't do that with your own physical\nservers, but with a cloud system you can.\n\n267\n00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260\n>> That's worth a cloud\nticket price right there.\n\n268\n00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,730\nI mean with that alone I'd be\nhappy with a cloud service.\n\n269\n00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,330\n>> Absolutely it's, in my opinion, of\nthe ten ones that I'm gonna show you here.\n\n270\n00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,280\nThat's the real big winner.\n\n271\n00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,950\nThat's the cool one.\n\n272\n00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,518\nAll right, another one for us.\n\n273\n00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:14,941\nElasticity.\n\n274\n00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,090\nAll right?\n\n275\n00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,220\nEach of these providers have\ndata centers all over the world.\n\n276\n00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,160\nRight?\nIf I go back to that Rackspace slide,\n\n277\n00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,450\nhere's all the Rackspace data\ncenters that are spread out.\n\n278\n00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,970\nAnd they're one of the smaller ones.\n\n279\n00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,740\nMicrosoft and Amazon have even more.\n\n280\n00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,720\nAmazon has 17 data centers.\n\n281\n00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,950\nWell within each of those data centers\nthey have redundant zones inside of there.\n\n282\n00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,830\nAmazon will have at least three\nzones in each data center.\n\n283\n00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,412\nMicrosoft the way they do theres is\nthrough the roof, you know 40 or\n\n284\n00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,180\n50 of these zones inside of one of theirs.\n\n285\n00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,730\nBut these are completely\nredundant environments,\n\n286\n00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,370\nthey call them availability zones.\n\n287\n00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,060\nIf one were to fail the others\nare completely unaffected.\n\n288\n00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,350\nThe cool part about the cloud is when you\nwhip up a server, the server is elastic.\n\n289\n00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,350\nIt can stretch across more than\none of these availability zones.\n\n290\n00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,000\nThat's what they call it elastic.\n\n291\n00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,990\nIt can kind of stretch and bounce.\n\n292\n00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,670\nIf one availability zone goes down,\n\n293\n00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,850\nyour server can just jump\nright over to another one.\n\n294\n00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,640\nOr we can spread the resources out.\n\n295\n00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,700\nWhere I have my web servers,\nmaybe I've got 20 of them, and\n\n296\n00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,940\nI put half in one zone and\nhalf in the other.\n\n297\n00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,750\nAnd if one zone goes down,\n\n298\n00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,180\nI can just double the amount of servers\nI've got in the zone that's still up.\n\n299\n00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,320\nYou do it on the fly, your end users don't\neven notice, and you get complete high\n\n300\n00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,760\navailability without having to worry about\nthe infrastructure underneath, right?\n\n301\n00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,410\nIt's called elasticity, and\nin the cloud your servers, your databases,\n\n302\n00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,840\nyour IP addresses, all of those\nthings are considered elastic.\n\n303\n00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,470\nThey can move.\n\n304\n00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,300\nThey can stretch from one\ndata center to another.\n\n305\n00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,610\nAnd that's really, really cool.\n\n306\n00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,480\nAll right, who's next on my list?\n\n307\n00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,650\nOh, number seven.\n\n308\n00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,210\nGeolocation.\n\n309\n00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,880\nGeolocation means putting\nresources close to your customers.\n\n310\n00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,650\nNow, this show.\n\n311\n00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,510\nWe're filming this show right\nhere in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n312\n00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,090\nAnd we're streaming it out\nthrough our internet provider,\n\n313\n00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,960\nwhich is here in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n314\n00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,590\nSo, if you're in Gainesville, Florida and\nyou're on the same service provider with\n\n315\n00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,240\nus, then you're getting\na great connection.\n\n316\n00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,199\nThis video coming right to you.\n\n317\n00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,940\nBut what if you're in Europe.\n\n318\n00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,270\nWhat if you're in Australia or China,\nyou're on the other side of the globe.\n\n319\n00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,040\nGainesville is a long way away from there.\n\n320\n00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,890\nSo wouldn't it be nice if\nyou could watch this video\n\n321\n00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,290\nfrom a server that was close to you.\n\n322\n00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,580\nIf you're in China wouldn't it be\nnice to watch from a server in China.\n\n323\n00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,650\nIf you're in Australia, from a server in\nAustralia, that's called geolocation.\n\n324\n00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,890\nMost companies can't do that.\n\n325\n00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,000\nRight?\nIf we wanted to open up a data center\n\n326\n00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,635\nclose to our customers, well,\n\n327\n00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:38,460\n30% of our viewers are in\ncountries outside of the US.\n\n328\n00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,960\nWe'd have to open up data\ncenters all over the globe.\n\n329\n00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,900\nIt's just not financially possible.\n\n330\n00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,050\nBut we don't have to,\nbecause the cloud providers already have.\n\n331\n00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,160\nTake Rackspace, for example.\n\n332\n00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,950\nRackspace has servers in Chicago,\nDallas, in North Virginia,\n\n333\n00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,510\nright here in the U.S., but they also have\nLondon, Hong Kong, and Sydney, Australia.\n\n334\n00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,520\nSo if I have viewers in Australia,\n\n335\n00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,630\nI can stick a server in\ntheir data center in Sydney.\n\n336\n00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,790\nOr if I've got viewers in China,\nI can stick servers in Hong Kong.\n\n337\n00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,710\nAnd now, users in that region\ncan get access to my data.\n\n338\n00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,580\nFrom servers that\nare geographically close to them.\n\n339\n00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,680\nAll right, there's big problems\nright now with the undersea cables\n\n340\n00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,370\nbeing near saturation point.\n\n341\n00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,090\nThe satellite links between\ncountries are near saturation point.\n\n342\n00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:25,060\nSo this helps to alleviate that,\nputs the data close to our users.\n\n343\n00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,550\nIt's called geolocation.\n\n344\n00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,090\nAnd it's not normally possible\nunless you're a massive company,\n\n345\n00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,590\nbut with a cloud service,\neven a small company can do this.\n\n346\n00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,070\nYou can spin up instances wherever\nyou like and it's as easy as this.\n\n347\n00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,760\nLike here in Amazon EC2, notice I'm in\nthe North Virginia region right now.\n\n348\n00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,840\nIf I want to spin a server up\nsomewhere else, I just drop that down.\n\n349\n00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,800\nI'm going to jump over to Singapore.\n\n350\n00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,990\nAll right.\n\n351\n00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,367\nSo I'll click on that button and now,\nafter a moment, cuz I am in the U.S.\n\n352\n00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,191\nIt's gonna flip me over to Singapore and\n\n353\n00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,623\nnow I can start spinning up\nservers right over there.\n\n354\n00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,264\nAnd I don't have any right now,\nbut I can launch one.\n\n355\n00:15:57,264 --> 00:16:00,084\nAnd now I'll have a server running\nup in the Singapore data center.\n\n356\n00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,244\nI'm just on a web page, no big deal to me.\n\n357\n00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:06,240\nI didn't have to go buy land and learn\nthe laws and all that other information.\n\n358\n00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,635\nAmazon's already done that.\n\n359\n00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,020\nGeolocation is an awesome\nfeature of cloud services.\n\n360\n00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,690\nAll right, next, this is the one the CIOs\nlove, your Chief Information Officer, and\n\n361\n00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,530\nthat's number eight on our list.\n\n362\n00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,440\nEconomic efficiency.\n\n363\n00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,460\nRight.\n\n364\n00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,970\nI kind of mentioned it with auto scaling,\nwhen you buy servers,\n\n365\n00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,000\nif you're buying your own physical server,\nfirst off you pay for them up front.\n\n366\n00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,770\nSo all that money up front.\n\n367\n00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,180\nAnd then they depreciate in value,\nit's like buying a car.\n\n368\n00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,160\nHalf the value is gone the moment\nyou open the box, right?\n\n369\n00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,020\nSo it's not like you could go and\nsell a server on eBay and\n\n370\n00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,970\nget the same money out of\nit that you put into it.\n\n371\n00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,540\n>> I've tried.\n[LAUGH] It doesn't work.\n\n372\n00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,860\n>> Yeah, they just don't retain value.\n\n373\n00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,310\nSo when you buy these servers,\nthat's a big investment.\n\n374\n00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,940\nAnd then if you don't use it you've\nalready made the investment.\n\n375\n00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,110\nYou've already paid for it.\n\n376\n00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,530\nBut with these guys,\nthey all bill on an hourly basis.\n\n377\n00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,780\nWhen you sign up,\nlike here's Amazon EC2's pricing schedule,\n\n378\n00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,865\nwhen we buy one of these like if I buy\na medium server with three CPUs and\n\n379\n00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:09,690\n3.75 gigs of RAM,\nit's gonna cost me $0.07 per hour.\n\n380\n00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,640\nThat's it, $0.07 per hour.\n\n381\n00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,680\nAnd if I know I'm not gonna use it\nthe next hour, I can shut it down.\n\n382\n00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,840\nAnd now,\nit doesn't cost me $0.07 per hour.\n\n383\n00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,550\nIt costs me nothing.\n\n384\n00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,130\nWell, if I have storage, I gotta pay for\nstorage, but that's a really,\n\n385\n00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,270\nreally small amount.\n\n386\n00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,550\nSo this is substantially different\nthan when you buy a physical server.\n\n387\n00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,910\nThis can save you a lot of money.\n\n388\n00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,420\nAnd if you buy a server\nthat has two CPUs and\n\n389\n00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,940\nfour gigs of RAM, and then you decide,\nI really need eight gigs of RAM.\n\n390\n00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,920\nYou gotta go and buy that extra memory.\n\n391\n00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,120\nWell maybe you only need the eight\ngigs of RAM for tomorrow.\n\n392\n00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,330\nWell here I can just bump up to\neight gigs of RAM for tomorrow,\n\n393\n00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,610\nand then when I'm done I can\nbump back down to four gigs.\n\n394\n00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,550\nWith a physical server you can't do that.\n\n395\n00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,030\nThese are things that make it\nwhere you save a ton of money.\n\n396\n00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,710\nYou only pay for what you absolutely need.\n\n397\n00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,000\nAnd this cost?\n\n398\n00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,040\nThis cost includes things like power,\nair conditioning, facilities,\n\n399\n00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,850\nmonitoring, right?\n\n400\n00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,850\nThe staff that's keeping\nan eye on this hardware.\n\n401\n00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,440\nThat's all stuff that we'd\nnormally have to pay.\n\n402\n00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,690\nThey're paying it for us.\n\n403\n00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,330\nAll wrapped up in this\nlittle $0.07 per hour.\n\n404\n00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,190\nThat's a good deal no\nmatter how you look at it.\n\n405\n00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,740\n>> Yeah, that should tickle\nthe fancy of even the most,\n\n406\n00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,240\nwell I'll say frugal of IT management.\n\n407\n00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,527\nThey're gonna see that price and\nsay okay when can we start doing that?\n\n408\n00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:22,368\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right another big reason that we\n\n409\n00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:27,340\nmight want to use a cloud provider\nlike this is industry certifications.\n\n410\n00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,022\nDepending on the industry\nthat you work in.\n\n411\n00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:32,390\nLet me get into the right little slides\nhere, I'll use one of Microsoft's.\n\n412\n00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,220\nHere we go.\n\n413\n00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,150\nDepending on the industry you work in, you\nmight be required to have your servers and\n\n414\n00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,100\nyour data center and\n\n415\n00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,750\nhow you handle information follow\ncertain governmental regulations.\n\n416\n00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,360\nWell in order to do that you've\ngot to configure your servers,\n\n417\n00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,900\nfollow certain procedures,\nhave procedures in place.\n\n418\n00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,700\nYou have to undergo regular\naudits to ensure that you're\n\n419\n00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,680\nadhering to the standards that are defined\nand then pass certain tests so\n\n420\n00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,460\nthat you get certified.\n\n421\n00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,230\nWell if you use a cloud provider,\nthey've usually already done it.\n\n422\n00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,050\nSo for example if I have a shopping cart,\nif I'm gonna be taking credit card data,\n\n423\n00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,630\nI have to be PCI compliant.\n\n424\n00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,240\nWell, Microsoft Azure,\nthis is that slide from their same tour,\n\n425\n00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240\nthe Microsoft Azure data centers\nare already PCI compliant.\n\n426\n00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480\nAnd that means if I put\nmy servers up there and\n\n427\n00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,870\nstore them on Microsoft's infrastructure,\n\n428\n00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,950\nthey've already met those requirements\nas far as the physical hardware.\n\n429\n00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,330\nNow on the software side, I could still\nbreak some rules and get in trouble.\n\n430\n00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,640\nBut on the hardware side,\nit's already done.\n\n431\n00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,850\nI don't have to worry about\nscheduling audits for that.\n\n432\n00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,210\nThey've already done it.\n\n433\n00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,290\nOr ISO 27001, SSAE 16,\nwhich is the old SAS 70.\n\n434\n00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,950\nThese guys, they're already certified and\n\n435\n00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,990\nauthorized in that and\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n436\n00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,200\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n437\n00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,950\nAnd if you've been watching the show\nthinking well yeah, but I work for\n\n438\n00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,870\na bank and we can't store financial\ndata up there, we're not allowed.\n\n439\n00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,300\nWell, it's SSAE 16 compliant, so\nyou actually can store data up there.\n\n440\n00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,060\nNow you do still have to take\nyour certain precautions but\n\n441\n00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,470\nthey've already met those requirements.\n\n442\n00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,800\nSo as far as adhering to regulations and\n\n443\n00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,910\nindustry standards,\nthey've already done it in a lot of cases.\n\n444\n00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,400\nNow do your research on this, cuz not all\nof the cloud providers have done it and\n\n445\n00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,930\nthey'll list the ones that are certified.\n\n446\n00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,280\nThese are just Microsoft's.\n\n447\n00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,590\nAmazon's might be different,\nRackspace's might be different, so\n\n448\n00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,920\ndo your research on that.\n\n449\n00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,120\nBut if you need industry\ncertifications for your servers,\n\n450\n00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,850\nfor your data center, a lot of times\nthese guys have already done it.\n\n451\n00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,740\n>> Now Don, it sounds like they're\ndoing everything they can to remove\n\n452\n00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,440\nevery obstacle that's keeping\nyou from moving to the cloud.\n\n453\n00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,300\nAnd I'm looking at the last item on your\nlist and this is probably the biggest one\n\n454\n00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,070\nthat people worry about that\nthey're like this is the linchpin,\n\n455\n00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,085\nthe stumbling block that's gonna keep\nme from actually moving into the cloud.\n\n456\n00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:43,035\nWhat is it?\n\n457\n00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:43,895\n>> Security.\n\n458\n00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,005\nRight, security is the big one.\n\n459\n00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:48,975\nMost people worry about putting\ninformation out there into the cloud\n\n460\n00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:51,035\nbecause it's a shared environment, right?\n\n461\n00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,755\nThey call it shared tendency.\n\n462\n00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:55,435\nYour virtual machines\nare running on hardware and\n\n463\n00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:57,815\nother people's virtual machines\nare running on that same hardware.\n\n464\n00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:59,145\nAnd you don't know who they are.\n\n465\n00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,393\nI have no idea who else it is\nthat's running systems on the same\n\n466\n00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,010\nhardware as me.\n\n467\n00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,033\nBut security is first and foremost in\nthe mind of the cloud providers and\n\n468\n00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:10,457\nhonestly they do a better job of security\nthan we do in most cases because a lot of\n\n469\n00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:13,690\ntimes in a company we're not\njust tasked with security.\n\n470\n00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,170\nWe're tasked with 20 other things and\nsecurity is one facet of our job.\n\n471\n00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,730\nBut at Google, at Rackspace,\nat Amazon and Microsoft they have tens,\n\n472\n00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,250\nhundreds, thousands of employees\nwhose sole focus is security.\n\n473\n00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,420\nThey're gonna do a better job.\n\n474\n00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,710\nThat's just how it is.\n\n475\n00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,010\nSo for example, Google put out a press\nlittle video, and these are some slides\n\n476\n00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,245\nfrom it, where they showed just how they\nreplace a failed hard drive, all right?\n\n477\n00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:40,365\nSo a hard drive failed on a server,\none of their techs goes to the server and\n\n478\n00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,555\nwithdraws the hard drive.\n\n479\n00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,985\nNow when they take it out,\nthey immediately scan it.\n\n480\n00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,505\nEvery hard drive has a barcode on it so\n\n481\n00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,395\nthey can track,\nthey call it their chain of custody.\n\n482\n00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:50,795\nThey can track what happens on that hard\ndrive from the moment it's installed\n\n483\n00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,500\nto the moment it's destroyed.\n\n484\n00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,600\nAnd when a hard drive is failed like this,\nthey don't just chuck it in the trash.\n\n485\n00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,680\nThey take it to a machine.\n\n486\n00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,430\nHere he's inserting it in the machine.\n\n487\n00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,480\nAnd it's got a boar drill that\ncomes down and cores the thing.\n\n488\n00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,980\nRight?\n\n489\n00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,300\nSo that's actually coming down and\ndestroying the drive.\n\n490\n00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,860\nWhen it's done, the drive looks like this.\n\n491\n00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,650\nYou see how there's that giant\nhole in the middle of it?\n\n492\n00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,330\nThat's not enough.\n\n493\n00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,880\nNow that technically is\nenough to destroy the drive.\n\n494\n00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,940\nBut then they take it and\nthrow it through a commercial shredder.\n\n495\n00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,390\nAnd when they're done,\nthis is all that's left.\n\n496\n00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,580\nSo this is what happens to\na failed hard drive at Google.\n\n497\n00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,850\nAfter this, it goes to recycling.\n\n498\n00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,690\nIt's metal, it can be recycled.\n\n499\n00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,950\nBut your data is safe.\n\n500\n00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,135\nIf you have your own servers and\nyou have a hard drive that fails,\n\n501\n00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,225\nI know what happens.\n\n502\n00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,455\nPeople take it and they say ooh,\n\n503\n00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:35,915\nI should dispose of this properly and\nthey stick it on a shelf.\n\n504\n00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,965\nAnd then over years it stacks up.\n\n505\n00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,125\nI've been in so many data centers\nwhere they just have a rack with 100\n\n506\n00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:40,710\nhard drives on it.\n\n507\n00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,790\nAnd you're like what are those hard drives\nand they say well they're all failed ones.\n\n508\n00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,350\nWe need to dispose of those at some point.\n\n509\n00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,247\nAnd then sooner or later somebody comes in\nand says nobody's ever gonna dispose of\n\n510\n00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,160\nthese, I'm just gonna chuck them and they\nthrow them in the trash and out they go.\n\n511\n00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,970\nThese hard drives have your\ncorporate data on them.\n\n512\n00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,050\nWell these providers, companies like\nGoogle, Amazon, Rackspace, they take that\n\n513\n00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:05,020\nto a high level and they even take you to\na high level with their own employees.\n\n514\n00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,620\nThis is that same Google data center,\nright?\n\n515\n00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,440\nThis is the gentleman doing the tour, hass\nthe highest level authorization to walk in\n\n516\n00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640\nthis data center, and even he has\nto conform to the security policy.\n\n517\n00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,710\nThey've got a no tailgating rule.\n\n518\n00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,290\nIf there's three Google employees that\nwalk up to this door at the same time,\n\n519\n00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,570\neach one of them has to open the door,\nwalk through it and\n\n520\n00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,320\nclose it behind them, and\nthey'll have to do it three times, right?\n\n521\n00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760\nEach of the employees do it themselves.\n\n522\n00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,940\nThey do not allow two people to go through\nthat door at once and it's on film.\n\n523\n00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,890\nAnd then you might not recognize what\nthis is but it's a metal detector.\n\n524\n00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,590\nThey actually walk through a metal\ndetector to show that they're not taking\n\n525\n00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,750\nhard drives and\nother equipment in and out.\n\n526\n00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,930\nThey check them for USB keys and\n\n527\n00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,190\nother things that might allow them to\nmove data in and out of the data center.\n\n528\n00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,300\nSo this is a level of security that I know\nwe don't have that here, right, Daniel.\n\n529\n00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,160\nWe got servers here,\nwe don't do this stuff.\n\n530\n00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,130\n>> Yeah, people could easily walk away\nwith our servers compared to what they got\n\n531\n00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,941\ngoing on here [LAUGH].\n\n532\n00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:57,929\n>> Meanwhile people are watching this\nvideo going I know what I'm getting my\n\n533\n00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:58,561\nnext servers.\n\n534\n00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,401\n>> Gainsville, Florida.\n\n535\n00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:02,310\n[LAUGH] Book that flight.\n\n536\n00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,690\n>> So this is definitely\nsomething to think about.\n\n537\n00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,285\nIn terms of security\nthey're doing a great job.\n\n538\n00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:13,585\nSo, your hardware is safe, and if you're\ndoing managed software with them,\n\n539\n00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,405\nyour software is safe.\n\n540\n00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:16,205\nThey're monitoring and\ncontrolling all that.\n\n541\n00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,855\nIf you're not,\nif you're doing the software,\n\n542\n00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,875\nwell, you can make your software weak.\n\n543\n00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,762\nIt's definitely possible, but for\n\n544\n00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,202\nthe part that the cloud provider's taken\ncare of, it's really top notch stuff.\n\n545\n00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,482\nThey really are going that extra mile.\n\n546\n00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:31,472\nAnd in a lot of cases they're gonna\nhave more money at their disposal and\n\n547\n00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:32,422\nthey're going to want to do it right.\n\n548\n00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:36,930\nBecause if they do it wrong,\nimagine the PR debacle that they'll have.\n\n549\n00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,882\nIf Amazon's EC2 data\ncenters get compromised,\n\n550\n00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:42,772\ntheir customers are gonna leave in droves\nand this is just gonna kill that service.\n\n551\n00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,760\nSo they've got a reason to bump that up.\n\n552\n00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,420\nSo, item number ten there was security.\n\n553\n00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,990\n>> Well, Don, it sounds like we've\nhopefully dispelled all the fears and\n\n554\n00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,330\nthe mystification that goes\naround how you can actually\n\n555\n00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,160\nimplement some of these cloud services.\n\n556\n00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,990\nA lot of good stuff there,\n\n557\n00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,870\na lot of ways that we can take\nadvantage of what they offer.\n\n558\n00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,273\nI know I've definitely become an acolyte.\n\n559\n00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,994\nThe cloud is the way to go, everyone.\n\n560\n00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:09,253\nIt is how you should rock.\n\n561\n00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:12,420\n[LAUGH] That being said,\nhave we missed anything?\n\n562\n00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,260\nHave we covered it?\n\n563\n00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,840\nThe only thing I wanna mention is there\n\n564\n00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,380\nare times where the cloud\nis not an option.\n\n565\n00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,160\nSo be aware of that.\n\n566\n00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,890\nI just gave you ten reasons\nwhy you should use the cloud.\n\n567\n00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,319\nLet me give you one reason why\nyou can't or when you shouldn't.\n\n568\n00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,710\nOne reason when you shouldn't\nis when you have data\n\n569\n00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,650\nthat is mandated not to be\nallowed to be put in the cloud.\n\n570\n00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,210\nAnd that does happen.\n\n571\n00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,618\nIf you work for the government there\nare times where you have data that's\n\n572\n00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:38,710\nconsidered of a sensitive nature.\n\n573\n00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,890\nAnd they will not allow it to be cloud\nhosted and that shouldn't go in the cloud.\n\n574\n00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,800\nIf you're under regulations or\nrules that stipulate that.\n\n575\n00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,620\nIf you're dealing with patient medical\nrecords,and your city, state, country, has\n\n576\n00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,300\nrules that says medical records have to be\nheld by you, then you've gotta hold them.\n\n577\n00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,490\nYou can't put them in the cloud.\n\n578\n00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,510\nSo that does happen.\n\n579\n00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,300\nBe sure to check your local laws and\n\n580\n00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,710\nregulations that govern the type\nof business that you're in.\n\n581\n00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,110\nBut for most people,\nthose ten reasons that we just gave?\n\n582\n00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,000\nThose are your motivation.\n\n583\n00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,330\nThat's why you should be using the cloud.\n\n584\n00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,050\n>> Yeah.\nPlease cloud responsibly.\n\n585\n00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,810\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n586\n00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,130\n>> That's what we do.\n\n587\n00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,365\nAll right, well I guess that being said,\nwe've wrapped up another great episode.\n\n588\n00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,010\nHope you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n589\n00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,250\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n590\n00:26:20,250

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,810\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,680\nHere with me today is none\nother than Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,740\nHow you doing today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,790\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,800\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about business continuity,\n\n8\n00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,390\nwhich is, well, continuing to do\nbusiness when a failure happens, right?\n\n9\n00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,150\nA lot of networks have this occur\nwhere servers fail, data centers fail,\n\n10\n00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,370\nmaybe power goes out,\nInternet connectivity dies out.\n\n11\n00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,850\nMaybe a hurricane destroys your\nentire facility right, it can be\n\n12\n00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,610\nthe little problem all the way up to\na massive career changing type problem.\n\n13\n00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,140\nWe need ways for our business to continue\nfunctioning when that disaster occurs.\n\n14\n00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,630\nAnd this is a niche that cloud\nservices are really been able to fill\n\n15\n00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,890\nreally well due to the nature of on\ndemand access to resources, right?\n\n16\n00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,520\nIt really just fits together great.\n\n17\n00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,500\nAnd so this is a wonderful application\nof using cloud services in IT.\n\n18\n00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,970\n>> Yeah ,I've noticed that IT\nmanagers are real sticklers for\n\n19\n00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,350\nthat old uptime [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,360\n>> Yeah, they expect your\nstuff to work all the time.\n\n21\n00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,710\nI never understood that myself.\n\n22\n00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,520\nLike, hey, works some of the time,\nisn't that good enough?\n\n23\n00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,100\nBut no, no, they want more.\n\n24\n00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,008\n>> You reboot one Exchange server\nduring production hours and\n\n25\n00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,705\nthey haul their hairnets on fire.\n\n26\n00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:22,702\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:26,882\nSo, when we talk about business continuity\nwe're really kind of tacking on top of\n\n28\n00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,250\navailability here.\n\n29\n00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,910\nWell, in the security world we're talking\nabout a few different things, but\n\n30\n00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,310\nredundancy, availability, all these things\nkind of fall into business continuity.\n\n31\n00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,020\nBusiness continuity just states\nthat if a failure happens\n\n32\n00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,320\nyou should be able to continue working.\n\n33\n00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,800\nYou should be able to continue\ndoing things like normal\n\n34\n00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,380\neven though you've had some\nkind of failure or loss,\n\n35\n00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,680\nso that typically means if I've\ngot one server I need two servers.\n\n36\n00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,540\nIf I have one power supply\nI need two power supplies.\n\n37\n00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,310\nIf I have one Internet connection\nI need two Internet connections.\n\n38\n00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,990\nBut all that comes with a cost.\n\n39\n00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,330\nAnd one of the common models for\n\n40\n00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,865\nbusinesses is if you have a big data\ncenter with, say, 400 servers in it,\n\n41\n00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:08,140\nthen you might have a disaster\nrecovery data center somewhere else\n\n42\n00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,810\nwith 400 servers in it, so that you can\nmirror your production environment.\n\n43\n00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,090\nIf one fails you can\nflip over to the other.\n\n44\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,180\nBut think about all the costs\ninvolved with that,\n\n45\n00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,900\njust get, really really expensive\ncuz you gotta build a data center.\n\n46\n00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,390\nYou've got to populate it was servers.\n\n47\n00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,900\nEvery time you buy a server in production,\nyou gotta buy a server for DR, too.\n\n48\n00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,130\nAnd the worst part is, if you go\nan entire year without a single failure,\n\n49\n00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,300\nwhat was that hardware in the DR\nside doing all that time?\n\n50\n00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,350\nSitting there.\n\n51\n00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,190\nSitting there as a safety net, right?\n\n52\n00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,850\nIt's got value.\n\n53\n00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,260\nIt's got big value if failure happens, but\nwhen a failure doesn't happen, you're CIO,\n\n54\n00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,450\nyour staff, people like that,\nthey start looking at it and going,\n\n55\n00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,330\nboy, that was a big cost center.\n\n56\n00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,770\nI was pumping money into that data center,\nand it never actually did anything, and\n\n57\n00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,050\nthat's when the bad\nstuff starts happening.\n\n58\n00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,220\nThey say, I wonder, we ought to scale\nthat back, do we need every server in DR?\n\n59\n00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,180\nOr how about this,\nwhen we buy new high end servers for\n\n60\n00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,860\nproduction we'll just take\nthe old ones and put them in DR.\n\n61\n00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,530\nAnd now when a failure happens\nyou flip over and you run\n\n62\n00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,950\nit on 10 year old servers that are junk,\nand you might as well not even have them.\n\n63\n00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,030\nThose are the types of things that happen,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,130\ncloud services can help\ninsulate us from that.\n\n65\n00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,922\nAnd I'm talking about data centers,\nI'm talking about big stuff, but\n\n66\n00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,367\nit also applies to small things too,\nlike your home computer.\n\n67\n00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,667\nLet me just give you an example,\nmy computer at home.\n\n68\n00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,545\nRight?\nI've got a PC at home, and I've got all of\n\n69\n00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:29,041\nmy family photos on there, photos that\nI've taken since like from my wife and\n\n70\n00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:34,360\nI's wedding, through our first child being\nborn, second child, and all of that.\n\n71\n00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,850\nThose photos, those are important to me,\nso I back them up.\n\n72\n00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,295\nI've got a storage hard drive on my\nsystem, and I've got a second storage\n\n73\n00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:43,945\nhard drive right next to it, and every\nnight at midnight I clone the drives.\n\n74\n00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,745\nRight?\nSo I've got two copies.\n\n75\n00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:48,465\nIf a hard drive fails I\nwill have all my photos.\n\n76\n00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,775\nI know that I can't recreate those.\n\n77\n00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,995\nEverything else I have I can recreate,\nright, but those photos,\n\n78\n00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:54,755\nthat's the only thing I\nhave I can't recreate.\n\n79\n00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:57,705\nSo I've got that backed up, right?\n\n80\n00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,315\nWhat if I have a house fire?\n\n81\n00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,950\nIf I have a house fire, and\n\n82\n00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,220\nI lose both hard drives, well,\nnow I've just lost that data.\n\n83\n00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,200\nBut it's just my home.\n\n84\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,040\nI can't have a DR site somewhere.\n\n85\n00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,340\nI'm not gonna build a second home\nsomewhere in case mine burns down.\n\n86\n00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,290\nI'm going to go to a hotel, right?\n\n87\n00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,290\nI'm gonna just rent a room when I need it,\non demand.\n\n88\n00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,180\nThat's how our backup services should be,\nyou just have a backup service that\n\n89\n00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,490\nyou run, it's on demand,\nit's when you need it.\n\n90\n00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,640\nAnd so cloud services have small\nsolutions for home users and\n\n91\n00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,680\nsmall businesses, all the way up\nto big solutions for enterprises.\n\n92\n00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,310\nAnd so I want to show you guys some\nexamples of that in this episode, and\n\n93\n00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,020\nkind of let you see\nthe options that are available.\n\n94\n00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,670\nSo let's take this computer\nhere as an example,\n\n95\n00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,530\nthis is just a Windows 8 workstation and\nmaybe I work in a small business, or\n\n96\n00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,650\nmaybe this is my personal machine.\n\n97\n00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,520\nAnd I'm doing my backups,\nI've got my own local hard drive, and\n\n98\n00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,660\nI've got a second one I hook up.\n\n99\n00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,510\nMaybe this is a Mac and\nI've got a Time Machine drive attached.\n\n100\n00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,850\nBut I'm really worried about\nif a house fire happens or\n\n101\n00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,030\nsomebody breaks into the house and\nthey steal the computer and\n\n102\n00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,740\nthey see that USB drive sitting there and\nthey go oh, take that too.\n\n103\n00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,436\nRight?\nIt's not like somebody's going to break in\n\n104\n00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:04,073\nand say, well, let me leave the backup\ndrive so they'll at least have their data.\n\n105\n00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,661\nThink I can only get 20 bucks for\nthat on eBay [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm worried about that.\n\n107\n00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,605\nWell I can start backing up to the cloud.\n\n108\n00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,775\nAnd I want to show you\ntwo different solutions.\n\n109\n00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,745\nThere's literally hundreds of cloud\nbackup solutions that are out there.\n\n110\n00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:23,025\nSome of them that are a lot\nmore automated than others.\n\n111\n00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:27,740\nSome of them that I've used like for\nexample you hear about Carbonite\n\n112\n00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,150\nis one where basically with\nthe Carbonite guys you install a little\n\n113\n00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,130\nclient on your computer and you back up\nall of your data to Carbonite servers.\n\n114\n00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,170\nThey have cloud based storage, and\nyour backups run to them and it saves it.\n\n115\n00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,680\nThey've got personal and business\nsolutions, and that's how it runs.\n\n116\n00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,830\nThere's also, for example,\nCrashPlan, which I actually do use.\n\n117\n00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,940\nI don't use Carbonite but\nI do use CrashPlan.\n\n118\n00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,150\nThe CrashPlan guys where\nit's the same thing.\n\n119\n00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,320\nYou install a little agent\non your computer, and\n\n120\n00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,220\nit backs up to their cloud, right?\n\n121\n00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,260\nNow the problem with solutions like these,\nor you could say it's to\n\n122\n00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,540\nthe benefit of solutions is that\nyou don't control that storage.\n\n123\n00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,020\nThey control the storage, right?\n\n124\n00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,660\nYou're backing up to their servers, and\nyou're trusting them to protect the data,\n\n125\n00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,940\nand to secure the data, and so on.\n\n126\n00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,760\nAnd one thing that I've noticed\nwith a lot of these providers\n\n127\n00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,300\nis that they really\nthrottle your upload speed.\n\n128\n00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,700\nSo Dropbox for example,\nI have about 500 gigs of data at home.\n\n129\n00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,900\nThat's my photos and documents and\nthings that are important to me.\n\n130\n00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,810\nAnd so I tried using Dropbox at one point\nto I'm gonna use Dropbox as my backup.\n\n131\n00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,171\nWhen I run a backup, from now on instead\nof backing up to my own local hard drive\n\n132\n00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,270\nI'll just replicate it up to Dropbox.\n\n133\n00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,230\nThey can store it and\nit'll all the available there,\n\n134\n00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,750\nand, they've got plans that are, it's like\n$100 a month for a terabyte or something.\n\n135\n00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,430\nAnd so you can you can back things up,\nor, yeah, here.\n\n136\n00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,660\nI'm logged into my ITProTV one,\nbut even if I just sign out here.\n\n137\n00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,780\nWith these guys you can sign up for\nan account and backup to it, but\n\n138\n00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,290\nthey throttle their upload speed, and\n\n139\n00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,620\nthat's how they kind of limit the amount\nof resources you get up there.\n\n140\n00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,300\nSo that initial upload of 500 gigs,\n\n141\n00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,680\nit about 7 days to get all\nthat up into Dropbox's system.\n\n142\n00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,010\nSo that kind of solution,\nit's okay for a home user.\n\n143\n00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,897\nBut if you're in a business, you're in\na hurry you might want better control of\n\n144\n00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,520\nthe bandwidth, you might want better\ncontrol of the data as it's stored,\n\n145\n00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,410\nyou might want access to the data\nas it's stored on the server.\n\n146\n00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,040\nAnd these solutions don't quite\nwork out so well for that, right.\n\n147\n00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,060\nIf you're looking for\nsomething fully managed, right?\n\n148\n00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,000\nWe're talking software as a service,\nthen Dropbox, Crash Plan, Carbonite.\n\n149\n00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,080\nThey're great.\n\n150\n00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,661\nDefinitely do that,\nyou'll set it up it and\n\n151\n00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:31,730\nyou'll never have to worry about it again.\n\n152\n00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,880\nThey're all great products.\n\n153\n00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,900\nAll right.\n\n154\n00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,250\nBut if you want control of that storage,\nthese guys aren't gonna work for you, and\n\n155\n00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,930\nthat's where we just step it up a notch.\n\n156\n00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,330\nAnd what we can do is we can say all\nright, I'm gonna use Amazon S3's storage,\n\n157\n00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,500\nor I'm gonna use Microsoft Azure storage.\n\n158\n00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,122\nAnd that's where I'm gonna back up\nto because I control that storage.\n\n159\n00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:52,002\nBut those are hard to use, aren't they?\n\n160\n00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,918\nLike setting up an S3 bucket,\nand putting data,\n\n161\n00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,981\nI don't want my end users to\nhave to worry about that.\n\n162\n00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:58,788\nWell, there's solutions to\nmake that much easier and\n\n163\n00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:02,190\nI've got two of them setup\non my laptop right here.\n\n164\n00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,720\nIf you look,\nI've got a little program called Arc and\n\n165\n00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,140\na little program called\nMicrosoft Azure Backup.\n\n166\n00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,841\nBoth of these are backup solutions.\n\n167\n00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,861\nLet's start with Arc.\n\n168\n00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,121\nArc's a cool one.\n\n169\n00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:16,220\nIt's a little program,\nit costs, I think $40.\n\n170\n00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,122\nAnd you buy it,\nyou install it on your computer and\n\n171\n00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:23,910\nthen you can backup your individual files\nyou pick folders or whatever to backup.\n\n172\n00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,890\nAnd it can back it up to any number\nof different cloud services.\n\n173\n00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,582\nSo like if I go and fire up Arc, I've\ngot mine setup to backup to Amazon S3.\n\n174\n00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:36,770\nBut when you set it up, you actually have\nthe option to add in other services.\n\n175\n00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,770\nSo I did S3, but I could add in\nGoogle Drive Microsoft OneDrive,\n\n176\n00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,901\nGoogle Cloud Storage, Dropbox.\n\n177\n00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:46,750\nSo you can backup to different ones,\nbut I've got it going to S3.\n\n178\n00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,040\nAll you do is create a bucket in Amazon S3\nand you give it security credentials,\n\n179\n00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,620\nwhich I've entered in right here.\n\n180\n00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,031\nAnd now, I can backup and\nI've got this set to run every hour.\n\n181\n00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,104\nSo once an hour,\n\n182\n00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:01,330\nthis is gonna run and it's going\nto backup files that I selected.\n\n183\n00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,230\nSo I browsed on my hard drive and\nI checked off some files to backup and\n\n184\n00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,732\nit's going to back those up and\nit's backing them up to S3.\n\n185\n00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:13,380\nIf something ever goes wrong and I need\nto restore, well, I can go right in here.\n\n186\n00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,094\nAnd I can browse in and\nthere's my laptop and I can go and\n\n187\n00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,811\nfind those files that I backed up.\n\n188\n00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:21,610\nHere's the backup that I did last night or\nactually, that was this morning.\n\n189\n00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,370\nSo here's a backup I did this morning and\nI can browse in here and\n\n190\n00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,790\nI can find my desktop or\ndocuments that I chose to backup.\n\n191\n00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,322\nIt runs,\nI just see a simple backup program,\n\n192\n00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:33,130\nI don't see the complexity\nof Amazon S3 behind.\n\n193\n00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,570\nIt's taken care of this for me and\nI could run this on a server, if I wanted.\n\n194\n00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,799\nOr here, I'm just running it on a desktop,\nlaptop, whatever and\n\n195\n00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,311\nnow you're backing up to S3.\n\n196\n00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,364\nAnd if I log into my Amazon console and\nI go into S3,\n\n197\n00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:49,910\nI can find that bucket that\nit's being backed up to.\n\n198\n00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,262\nIt gives it kind of a pseudo randomized\nname and I can come in here and\n\n199\n00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,550\nI can find where it's\nbacking up all of that data.\n\n200\n00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,547\nActually, I need to go\ninto this folder and\n\n201\n00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,610\nwe can start to find\nwhere it's putting it.\n\n202\n00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,890\nThis is where it's backing\nall that data up to.\n\n203\n00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,537\nNow when I look at it this way, it's a lot\nmore complex, cuz I'm seeing that raw data\n\n204\n00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:13,100\nwhere it's backing stuff up to, but\nI don't have to see it this way.\n\n205\n00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,840\nThis software masks all that for me.\n\n206\n00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,060\nSo for $40, now I can backup to S3 and\nit makes life really simple.\n\n207\n00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,111\nMicrosoft makes it even easier,\nthey eliminate that $40 part.\n\n208\n00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,400\nThey have Microsoft Azure Backup.\n\n209\n00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,505\nWith Azure backup,\nyou log into your Azure account and\n\n210\n00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,741\nyou go down here to Recovery Services.\n\n211\n00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:36,760\nIt is in this menu somewhere, let me,\n[LAUGH] I always have to hunt for it.\n\n212\n00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,621\nIt's under Recovery and basically,\nwhat we do is we go in and we create.\n\n213\n00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,962\nHere it is, Recovery Services.\n\n214\n00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,270\nWe create a storage vault.\n\n215\n00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,490\nA vault is someplace that you backup to.\n\n216\n00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,312\nAnd so when I come in here,\nI can choose New and you'll see,\n\n217\n00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,471\nI've got a Site Recovery and\na Backup Vault.\n\n218\n00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,400\nI'm gonna create a backup vault.\n\n219\n00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,070\nAnd when we create that backup vault,\nwe give it a name.\n\n220\n00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:01,589\nMaybe I want to back up Daniel's laptop,\nso I'll call this Daniel-Laptop.\n\n221\n00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,795\nAnd I wanna store that backup in East US,\nbut\n\n222\n00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,660\nI could store it in any other\ndata centers around the world.\n\n223\n00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,617\nI'll hit Create Vault and\nnow it's making that Daniel-Laptop vault.\n\n224\n00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,106\nAnd then as soon as that's done, it takes\na moment, but as soon as it's done,\n\n225\n00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,081\nI'll be able to browse into that.\n\n226\n00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,510\nI'll just show you here on my laptop.\n\n227\n00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,693\nIf I go into dplaptop, right in here,\n\n228\n00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,671\nyou can download your vault\ncredentials as a security certificate.\n\n229\n00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:29,721\nIt's gonna allow your laptop or desktop or\nserver to talk to Microsoft Azure and\n\n230\n00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,190\nthen you can download the agent.\n\n231\n00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,250\nAnd all you do is install the agent and\npoint it to that file you downloaded and\n\n232\n00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,990\nyour server, your desktop,\nyour laptop will automatically\n\n233\n00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,230\nconnect up to this vault and\nnow you're setup for backups.\n\n234\n00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,050\nAnd after that, all you have to\ndo is fire up this Azure backup\n\n235\n00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,670\nclient right here and\ntell it what it is you wanna backup.\n\n236\n00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,294\nAnd so you browse on your hard drive and\nAzure backup's actually more powerful than\n\n237\n00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:59,090\nArc, because I can backup individual files\nif I want, that's what I've been doing.\n\n238\n00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,630\nOr you can backup your entire machine,\nit can do a bare metal recovery.\n\n239\n00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,490\nThat means if the hard drive fails\non your laptop and get a brand\n\n240\n00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,012\nnew blank hard drive, you can actually\nboot off a recovery disk and do a Azure\n\n241\n00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:13,721\nrestore down to the system and recover\neverything, operating system and all.\n\n242\n00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,140\nIt's really, really powerful stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,075\nOr you could whip up a virtual machine in\nAzure and restore the Azure backup to it\n\n244\n00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:23,116\nand have your machine up and\nrunning in the cloud instantly,\n\n245\n00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,952\ninstead of having to wait for that new\nhard drive or a new computer to come in.\n\n246\n00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:30,630\nIf it's a server and\nyou need that server backup right now?\n\n247\n00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,580\nSpin in up an instance in Azure.\n\n248\n00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,530\nIt'll be up and running.\n\n249\n00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,513\nReally, really cool stuff and once\nyou're here, I mean, this is just a GUI.\n\n250\n00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:40,631\nYou go to Schedule Backup,\nyou tell it what you wanna backup.\n\n251\n00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:41,459\nThis stuff is easy.\n\n252\n00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,500\nNow this is just like the regular Windows\nbackup, if you wanna go and set that up.\n\n253\n00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,873\nSame thing here,\nit's just backing up to Azure and\n\n254\n00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:51,298\nyou can set it to backup twice a day or\nhowever long and\n\n255\n00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,185\nyou can set with retention periods\nthat are through the roof.\n\n256\n00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:58,623\nYou can say I wanna hold this for\n30 minutes or I want to hold it for\n\n257\n00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:00,495\n30 months, 30 years.\n\n258\n00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:05,196\nIt'll retain that as long as you want, you\nare paying storage fees on the back-end.\n\n259\n00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:09,237\nAnd it's usually something like 5 or\n$0.06 per gigabyte per month, so\n\n260\n00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,737\nyou're really not talking\nabout a lot of data.\n\n261\n00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,990\nThat 500 gigs of data that I\nwas talking about that I have.\n\n262\n00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,170\nThey usually end up costing me about 2 or\n$3 a month,\n\n263\n00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,600\nthat's worth it to have off site backup.\n\n264\n00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,349\nI don't have to worry about my house\nburning down and losing the data,\n\n265\n00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:25,041\nI know it's all backed up and it's there.\n\n266\n00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,042\n>> You still have to worry\nabout your house burning down.\n\n267\n00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,201\n[LAUGH]\n>> There is that.\n\n268\n00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,351\n>> You don't want to have your house\nburned down, but how would this actually,\n\n269\n00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,200\nI mean,\nthis is actually really cool stuff.\n\n270\n00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,077\nHow does this compare to something like\na traditional form of backup that we might\n\n271\n00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:42,560\nthink of using file servers and\nShadowProtect and things like that?\n\n272\n00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,932\n>> Yeah, so this really does\nreplace those forms of backup.\n\n273\n00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,140\nYou can use them to supplement or replace.\n\n274\n00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,818\nSo if you're running backups every night\nof your system, your backing up to tape or\n\n275\n00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:54,191\nhard drive or DVD or whatever.\n\n276\n00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,840\nWell now,\nyou'd just be backing up to the cloud.\n\n277\n00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,101\nSo you don't really need\nthat local backup anymore,\n\n278\n00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:04,737\nunless what happens if you have a failure\nand you need to rebuild your data and\n\n279\n00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,281\nyou don't have an internet connection.\n\n280\n00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,880\nWell, these backups are in the cloud.\n\n281\n00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,801\nIf you don't an Internet connection,\nyou can't get to them.\n\n282\n00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:14,730\nSo there is still a need for\npeople to have local backups.\n\n283\n00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,523\nSo you might need to have that stored\nright there in your own system,\n\n284\n00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,610\nthat could be important.\n\n285\n00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,150\nBut for a lot of people,\nbackup to the cloud and that it.\n\n286\n00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,294\nI've set this up for a number of companies\nover the years, and it really is nice,\n\n287\n00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,390\ncuz if You just set it up and\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n288\n00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,038\nYou don't say,\n\n289\n00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:30,961\nall right, I need somebody to come in and\nrotate this media every morning.\n\n290\n00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:33,167\nEvery morning somebody's got\nto change these tapes out or\n\n291\n00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,670\nswap out this USB drive.\n\n292\n00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,490\nOtherwise, the backups don't\nmaintain their proper schedule.\n\n293\n00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,892\nHere, you just set it up, it goes a cloud,\nnobody rotates anything and it's done.\n\n294\n00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:45,648\n>> Yeah and if you needed data, off of\nthat you don't have to go to the tapes,\n\n295\n00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:46,790\ngrab those tapes.\n\n296\n00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,391\nFind the right tape, don't forget that.\n\n297\n00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:53,170\nPut it in the tape robot or whatever you\nhave and then find it through there.\n\n298\n00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,066\nYou just go to your cloud system,\nfind what you're looking for and restore.\n\n299\n00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,410\n>> Yeah, now these solutions\nthat we've seen so far.\n\n300\n00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,672\nThese are suitable for home users,\nfor small businesses medium,\n\n301\n00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:04,430\neven large businesses if you want.\n\n302\n00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,154\nBut there's some even better solutions\nthat are out there that go a little bit\n\n303\n00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,920\nbigger picture.\n\n304\n00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,767\nIf you're a company and you lose your\nfacility it's a lot different than,\n\n305\n00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,681\nif my house burns down.\n\n306\n00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:16,700\nMy house burned down, yeah,\nI got one or two computers.\n\n307\n00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,030\nI'm the person that's affected and\nmy family and that's not it.\n\n308\n00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,122\nBut if your corporate\ndata center goes down,\n\n309\n00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:26,145\nyou could have thousands of employees that\nare sitting there twiddling their thumbs,\n\n310\n00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:27,760\ncuz they can't get any work done.\n\n311\n00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,881\nThat's a big problem.\n\n312\n00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:34,177\nSo you need a bigger solution and\nthere's different tiers of this, but\n\n313\n00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:38,186\nwhat we normally see is where you\ndon't just do an off site backup,\n\n314\n00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,575\nyou actually do what's called\na cold site or a hot site.\n\n315\n00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,681\nThese are disaster recovery centers,\n\n316\n00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,829\nthey're separate data centers like I\nmentioned earlier that are designed to\n\n317\n00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:50,651\nkick into action if your\nmain data center goes down.\n\n318\n00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,875\nSo for example, I used to work for\na bank and at the bank we had,\n\n319\n00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,171\nour headquarters was in downtown Seattle.\n\n320\n00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:59,811\nAnd we had a a little more than a thousand\nemployees that were right there in\n\n321\n00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,990\nthe main facility in downtown Seattle.\n\n322\n00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,480\nWe had branches spread across four states.\n\n323\n00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,970\nIf the main data center in Seattle went\ndown, all those branches went down.\n\n324\n00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,270\nSo there were thousands of\nemployees that couldn't work.\n\n325\n00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,630\nAnd customers, right?\n\n326\n00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,460\nTens or hundreds of thousands of customers\nthat couldn't get to their money.\n\n327\n00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,180\nThat's bad, right?\n\n328\n00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,948\n>> Yeah.\n\n329\n00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:20,450\nSo we had a disaster recovery center\nthat was over in Spokane, Washington.\n\n330\n00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,840\nSo we had to have this facility that,\nwe had to maintain it,\n\n331\n00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,170\nwe had to have equipment in it.\n\n332\n00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,560\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nthat was associated with that.\n\n333\n00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,950\nThat was a few hundred miles away,\nso it was safe tectonically and\n\n334\n00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,150\nall that other stuff.\n\n335\n00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,850\nBut it was a pretty big maintenance\nburden, and we were paying for\n\n336\n00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,140\nthat data center 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week.\n\n337\n00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,830\nDay after day, month after month,\nyear after year, we were paying for that,\n\n338\n00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,800\nwhether we used it or not.\n\n339\n00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,538\nThe whole time that I was with the bank\nwe never actually had a failover for\n\n340\n00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:48,340\na true disaster.\n\n341\n00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,140\nWe had failovers for tests,\nbut never for a true disaster.\n\n342\n00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,890\nSo that whole time, we were pumping\nmoney into this data center,\n\n343\n00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,130\nand it's really just an insurance\npolicy and it is worth it believe me.\n\n344\n00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,852\nBut wouldn't it be better if we could do\nthat and not have to pay for it 24/7?\n\n345\n00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,090\nAnd the cloud lets us do that.\n\n346\n00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,010\nIf you set up a cold site,\na cold site is where you back your data up\n\n347\n00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,180\nto the cloud and\nthen when a failure happens\n\n348\n00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,200\nright at that moment you can\nspin up all the VMs you need.\n\n349\n00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,460\nThat are running your data.\n\n350\n00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,795\nYour data that has already been backed up.\n\n351\n00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,290\nThat's already there and it's ready to go.\n\n352\n00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,550\nWithin an hour you can have hundreds or\nthousands of servers up and\n\n353\n00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,480\nrunning your whole data\ncenter rebuilt in the cloud.\n\n354\n00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,450\nThe cool part about it is the backups.\n\n355\n00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,760\nSo, you got to run the backups, right?\n\n356\n00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,470\nThey've got to up to the cloud.\n\n357\n00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,140\nThey've got to be stored, so\nyou have to pay for storage but CPU, RAM,\n\n358\n00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,070\nbandwidth, those things, those are things\nthat are incurred when the servers are on.\n\n359\n00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,840\nWith a cold site the servers are off.\n\n360\n00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,810\nThey're just sitting there waiting, and\nthey're not truly sitting there right.\n\n361\n00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,460\nMicrosoft or Amazon, or whoever, they're\nrenting those servers out to other people.\n\n362\n00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,930\nSo they're making money on those servers.\n\n363\n00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,680\nThat's why you don't pay for them.\n\n364\n00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,410\nBut then the moment you need them you\ncan flip the switch and they jump on.\n\n365\n00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,500\nAnd, so Microsoft has a product,\nit's called Azure Site Recovery and\n\n366\n00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,010\nit is awesome.\n\n367\n00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,080\nAll right.\n\n368\n00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,600\nThe neon green web page is\na little bit hard to read, but\n\n369\n00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,910\nbasically what it does is it uses,\nlike the Azure agent that we saw a moment\n\n370\n00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,850\nago on that Windows eight machine, to back\nup all of your servers to the Azure cloud.\n\n371\n00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,580\nIt's backing up, and it's storing\nthe backup right up there, but it's not\n\n372\n00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,960\nactually running those machines, so you're\nnot incurring CPU, memory, you're not\n\n373\n00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,670\nincurring any of the virtual machine\ncharges, just regular Azure storage fees.\n\n374\n00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,190\nAnd then the moment you\nneed it you come in and\n\n375\n00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,700\nyou do what's called\norchestrated recovery.\n\n376\n00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,100\nYou tell it the order\nthe machines need to come up in.\n\n377\n00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,150\nLike, I need my domain\ncontrollers to come first,\n\n378\n00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,470\nthen my mail servers,\nfile servers last, whatever.\n\n379\n00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,400\nAnd all of a sudden it\nspins that stuff up.\n\n380\n00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,570\nAnd once it comes up all of the stuff\nthat you had in production is now up and\n\n381\n00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,070\nrunning in the cloud at a moment's\nnotice and you've recovered.\n\n382\n00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,990\nYour business is able to continue doing\nbusiness even though a massive failure has\n\n383\n00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,070\noccurred, even though the loss of\nyour primary data centers happened\n\n384\n00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,270\nyou're up and you're running.\n\n385\n00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,730\nIt's pretty awesome stuff, all right?\n\n386\n00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,880\nNow Azure Site Recovery is designed to be\na cold site or a warm site, is what they\n\n387\n00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,680\ncall it, cuz the servers are all prepped\nto go, they're just not actually running.\n\n388\n00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,524\nWith Amazon we can do\nAmazon's AWS Disaster Recovery,\n\n389\n00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:27,023\nwhere they can do the cold site warm site\nalso but they can also do a true hot site.\n\n390\n00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:30,637\nAnd a hot site is where you actually\ndo have the virtual machines up and\n\n391\n00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,820\nrunning right now.\n\n392\n00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,220\nYou are incurring those fees.\n\n393\n00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,655\nBut if a failure happens,\nyou can flip over instantly.\n\n394\n00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,640\nBecause the servers are already running,\nright?\n\n395\n00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,970\nSo if you need to minimize that downtime\nto as small an interval as possible.\n\n396\n00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,040\nYou can have a hot site.\n\n397\n00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,880\nThe servers are running,\nyou're paying more for it.\n\n398\n00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,980\nBut you flip over in a moment's notice,\nand it's done, right?\n\n399\n00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,380\nHot sites are extremely valuable.\n\n400\n00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,160\nA great example would be the New York\nStock Exchange during the September 11th\n\n401\n00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,090\nattacks, that their primary data center\nwas located in the World Trade Center.\n\n402\n00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,740\nIt was destroyed, right?\n\n403\n00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,212\nNow, most people, if you remember\nthe incident, the New York Stock Exchange,\n\n404\n00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:07,700\nthey closed for three days.\n\n405\n00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,140\nSo they shut down for three days.\n\n406\n00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,150\nWhat most people don't realize\nis they did that voluntarily\n\n407\n00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,980\nas a-\n>> Bereavement.\n\n408\n00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,620\n>> Yeah, like a memorial.\n\n409\n00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,792\nThey didn't do that for technical reasons.\n\n410\n00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,879\nWithin seconds of their\nmain data center failing,\n\n411\n00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:27,985\ntheir data center in New Jersey kicked in,\nit was already running.\n\n412\n00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,115\nThey just flipped right over to it.\n\n413\n00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:29,785\nThey had something,\n\n414\n00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:33,355\nI read somewhere, it was something like\nthree point one seconds of down time.\n\n415\n00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,192\nIt was something really, really brief.\n\n416\n00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,672\nThe other data center was running.\n\n417\n00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:37,712\nThey were in business.\n\n418\n00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,442\nSo they chose to close down.\n\n419\n00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:45,172\nIt wasn't a true technology disaster\nthere, it was more, respect.\n\n420\n00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,642\nSo that's the type of thing\nyou can do with a hot site.\n\n421\n00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,500\nNow the New York Stock Exchange,\nthey have a little bit of money.\n\n422\n00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,060\nAnd so maintaining their own\ndata center is not a big deal.\n\n423\n00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,470\nBut if you're a small or\nmedium sized company,\n\n424\n00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,960\nyou don't have those resources available,\nleverage the cloud, they can do it.\n\n425\n00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,790\nAnd Azure site recovery, AWS disaster\nrecovery, they make it pretty easy.\n\n426\n00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,210\nYou pump your servers in there\nyou set that boot order or\n\n427\n00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,970\nyou set them just to be running and\nreplicating, and you're business.\n\n428\n00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,390\nSo really cool stuff that's out there\nthat you can take advantage of and\n\n429\n00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,550\nkeep your business running\neven in a moment of failure.\n\n430\n00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,150\nNow one thing I will mention is if you're\ntalking about disaster recovery business\n\n431\n00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,620\ncontinuity, you want your business\nto run even during disaster.\n\n432\n00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,410\nWhat if you've got all your servers\nalready up in Microsoft Azure?\n\n433\n00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,630\nAnd Microsoft Azure has an outage,\nall right?\n\n434\n00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,830\nWhat then?\n\n435\n00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,210\nWell they've got all these regions,\n\n436\n00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,720\nthey've got all these data centers and\nstuff.\n\n437\n00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,510\nWe should be protected.\n\n438\n00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,340\nJust spread our stuff across there.\n\n439\n00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,790\nNot really, right?\n\n440\n00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,757\nIf you have all of your\nservers in Microsoft Azure,\n\n441\n00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:48,620\nall your eggs are in one basket.\n\n442\n00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,602\nYou do have a single point of failure.\n\n443\n00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,988\nEven though they have data\ncenters all around the world and\n\n444\n00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:54,448\nmultiple regions inside of there,\n\n445\n00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:57,332\nyour single point of failure is that\nit's all managed by one company.\n\n446\n00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,937\nAnd that one company might\nhave made a mistake somewhere.\n\n447\n00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:01,622\nAnd it happens right?\n\n448\n00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:07,620\nAmazon AWS has had a full system outage\nat least twice in the last ten years.\n\n449\n00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,096\nMicrosoft Azure has had it at least\nfour times in the last three years.\n\n450\n00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:16,570\nIt happens, all right, and\nit almost always not a server problem,\n\n451\n00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,820\nnot a physical rack problem.\n\n452\n00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,730\nIt's almost always a network issue,\na routing issue\n\n453\n00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,260\nwhere your servers are up and happy but\nnobody can get routed to them.\n\n454\n00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,380\nA simple infrastructure problem.\n\n455\n00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,140\nA subnet or a DNS problem that\nMicrosoft got burned on DNS twice.\n\n456\n00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,810\nSo that kind of stuff which is usually\ntransparent to us, we don't see it.\n\n457\n00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,660\nSo how do we ensure business continuity\nwhen something like that happens?\n\n458\n00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,230\nAnd the answer there, use two clouds.\n\n459\n00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,010\nRight?\n\n460\n00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,556\nWhy use one cloud when you can use two,\nor three, or four?\n\n461\n00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:47,710\n>> Four.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n462\n00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,815\nthis is the part of the show\nthat the cloud providers love,\n\n463\n00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:53,720\nbecause here's where we're saying, don't\njust buy from one, buy from all of them!\n\n464\n00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,900\nBut no, really, Apple, right?\n\n465\n00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> Apple has the,\n\n466\n00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,665\nwhat the heck is their cloud storage,\noh, iCloud.\n\n467\n00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,273\n[LAUGH]\n>> What's it called?\n\n468\n00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,137\nIs there any other name?\n\n469\n00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:03,700\n>> Throw an i in front of it.\n\n470\n00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,580\nYeah.\n>> The Apple Cloud?\n\n471\n00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,290\nI don't know.\n\n472\n00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,900\nSo iCloud.\n\n473\n00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,880\nThey needed cloud storage but\nApple's not a cloud storage company.\n\n474\n00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,000\nSo why reinvent the wheel?\n\n475\n00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,950\nWhat they did is when you\nstore your data with iCloud,\n\n476\n00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,340\nyou're actually storing it with\nAmazon S3 and Azure storage.\n\n477\n00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,079\nThey spread across both and it makes sense\nbecause if one of them goes down they need\n\n478\n00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,112\nto stay up and they don't want it\nto reflect poorly on them like oh,\n\n479\n00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,270\nMicrosoft failed and Apple went down?\n\n480\n00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,990\nWait a minute,\nthey don't want people to know.\n\n481\n00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,110\nThat should be invisible.\n\n482\n00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,790\nSo if Microsoft goes down,\nthey're still running on Amazon.\n\n483\n00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,648\nThey're fine, right?\n\n484\n00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,220\nYou hedge your bets,\nyou run on more than one.\n\n485\n00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,310\nBut now you have the challenge of managing\nmore than one and if you want to do\n\n486\n00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,280\na solution like that you really need\nto get a little more independent.\n\n487\n00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,310\nAnd a great product for that,\nlet me show you guys this.\n\n488\n00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,100\nThere's a product called the Veeam,\nor Veeam,\n\n489\n00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,730\ndifferent people say it different ways.\n\n490\n00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,960\nBut the Veeam Availability Suite, right?\n\n491\n00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,620\nIt's not inexpensive,\nis probably a good way to put it.\n\n492\n00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,960\nBut it's worth it, it's worth the money.\n\n493\n00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,900\nWhat these guys do, is they let you do\na backup strategy to set up hot sites and\n\n494\n00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,290\ncloud recovery and they can support more\nthan one infrastructure on the backend.\n\n495\n00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,830\nSo if you want some of your stuff on\nAzure and some of your stuff on S3,\n\n496\n00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,300\nor all of your stuff completely cloned\nbetween the two, they can do it,\n\n497\n00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,040\nyou manage it in one place.\n\n498\n00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,110\nAnd so there's a lot of\nsolutions that are out there for\n\n499\n00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,519\npeople like this that help to provide\nthat functionality and capability, and\n\n500\n00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,530\nmake it a lot easier on you.\n\n501\n00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,350\nBut this is how you would get\nthe highest level of availability.\n\n502\n00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,615\nIf Microsoft has an issue, or\nif Amazon has an issue, you're okay,\n\n503\n00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,460\nbecause you're also doing\nbusiness with another provider.\n\n504\n00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,190\nYou've got Rackspace involved or\nMedia Temple or somebody else.\n\n505\n00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,770\nSo that you can draw in those systems and\nflip over to them during an outage.\n\n506\n00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,210\nSo now, when you're watching the news and\nyou see, like, oh,\n\n507\n00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,050\nAWS is having an outage.\n\n508\n00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,530\nIt's pretty rare, but it does happen.\n\n509\n00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,370\nYou can sit there and\nsay well all right we'll just\n\n510\n00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,710\nincrease capacity over here that's\non this other side and that's that.\n\n511\n00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,160\nThat's the joy of using the cloud.\n\n512\n00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,721\nBut don't feel like you're completely\nsafe if all of your servers are in one\n\n513\n00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,440\nprovider.\n\n514\n00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,652\nEven though you spread them across regions\nor whatever, it's still one provider.\n\n515\n00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:15,470\nThat is still a single point failure.\n\n516\n00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,300\n>> Yeah, I guess the best way to go is\nif you can do it have as many points of\n\n517\n00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,050\nfailure as possible so-\n>> Have as many points of failure.\n\n518\n00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,060\nThat sounds really bad.\n\n519\n00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,728\n>> I know it sounds really bad but\nit's accurate.\n\n520\n00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:26,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n521\n00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,450\nWell Don, I think you've definitely\ngot us schooled up at least\n\n522\n00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,840\na good general understanding of\nhow we should be using these\n\n523\n00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,160\ncloud services to increase\nour business continuity.\n\n524\n00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,430\nAnd that's what's important, right?\n\n525\n00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,740\nMaking sure that our\nbusinesses are running and\n\n526\n00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,450\nthat data is available at any given time.\n\n527\n00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,475\nAs little downtime as possible is what\nwe're looking for, very awesome stuff.\n\n528\n00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:50,490\n>> Yep, and hopefully that takes away some\nof the the fear you guys have of using\n\n529\n00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,610\nservices like these,\nif you have that fear.\n\n530\n00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,310\nSome of you have already embraced it and\nmoved in.\n\n531\n00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,800\nBut even on the small of a home user\ncan take advantage of Amazon S3 or\n\n532\n00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,450\ntake advantage of Azure Storage.\n\n533\n00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,170\nSo you know you definitely do that.\n\n534\n00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,870\nDon't lose your data when there are so\n\n535\n00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,480\nmany options out here that\nare low risk and really low cost.\n\n536\n00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,590\n>> Well Don, I guess that brings us to\nthe end of another great episode from\n\n537\n00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,110\nITProTV studios.\n\n538\n00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,870\nTime to sign off.\n\n539\n00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,100\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n540\n00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,110\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n541\n00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,042\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:22,060\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,509\nI'll be your host today, Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,661\nAnd with me as always is Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,660\nHow are doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,090\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,130\nIn this episode we're going to be tackling\na pretty important topic which is\n\n9\n00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,840\nmonitoring and service management,\n\n10\n00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,060\nI guess is a nice good generic\nname to stick on this.\n\n11\n00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,500\nBut basically it's when you\nimplement a solution in the cloud,\n\n12\n00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,560\nhow do you know that it's actually\nas reliable as you think it is?\n\n13\n00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,430\nWe talk about all these great features and\n\n14\n00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,520\nredundancies and availability\nimprovements that we get with a cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,700\nBut how do you actually know it's\nperforming to the level that you think\n\n16\n00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,650\nthat it is?\n\n17\n00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,060\nAnd it comes down to service management,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,140\nManaging how our systems are deployed,\nhow they run,\n\n19\n00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,640\nrecognizing when there's issues and\ncorrecting for that, and so\n\n20\n00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,130\nit's just a number of little\ntechniques we need to apply.\n\n21\n00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,350\nThink of this episode as the follow-up\nto finishing your movement to the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,020\nYou've just got all your stuff put\nin the cloud, now what do you do?\n\n23\n00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,605\nWell, you maintain and\nyou continue operating, and\n\n24\n00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,975\nthat all falls under this kind of\numbrella term of service management.\n\n25\n00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,085\n>> So would you say this is\n\n26\n00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:18,365\nbasically making sure you're\ngetting what you paid for?\n\n27\n00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:19,045\n>> Absolutely.\n\n28\n00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,174\n>> Awesome.\n>> Absolutely, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,243\nThe cloud providers, they make promises.\n\n30\n00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:23,502\nMake a lot of promises.\n\n31\n00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:27,120\n[LAUGH] And in their defense,\nmost of the time they live up to them, but\n\n32\n00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,250\nsometimes they don't.\n\n33\n00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,320\nAnd so we've got to make sure that we've\ngot systems that let us recognize that.\n\n34\n00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040\nAll right, so we're going to talk about\na few of those here in this episode, just\n\n35\n00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,535\ntalk about a few different things that\nwe need to be aware of as we implement.\n\n36\n00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,785\nAnd I wanna start with monitoring and\nSLAs.\n\n37\n00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:42,745\nAll right?\n\n38\n00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:47,775\nSLAs are Service Level Agreements,\nand basically when you sign up for\n\n39\n00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:55,330\na cloud service like Amazon EC2, inside of\nAWS, or Microsoft Azure, you spin up a VM.\n\n40\n00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,890\nThey make a guarantee to you.\n\n41\n00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,820\nThey tell you that they're gonna provide\na world class infrastructure with a world\n\n42\n00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,160\nclass team of IT guys working behind it,\nkeeping it up and running and that you're\n\n43\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,930\ngoing to get that same level of service\nthat you'd expect from that kind of thing.\n\n44\n00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,670\nWell at the end of the day,\nthey do a great job of that, right.\n\n45\n00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,930\nThey literally do have world class data\ncenters, and they literally do have\n\n46\n00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,770\nthe best of the best of the network\nengineers and sys admins working for them.\n\n47\n00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,205\nBut problems still happen.\n\n48\n00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:24,255\nSo we need to be able\nto keep an eye on that.\n\n49\n00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,285\nAnd let me just show you\nguys an example here.\n\n50\n00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,455\nI'm pulling up, this is Rackspace.\n\n51\n00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:32,145\nAnd the Rackspace guys,\nthey're are a big data provider out there,\n\n52\n00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:34,510\na lot of people host their\nservers with Rackspace.\n\n53\n00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,390\nAnd they publish their SLAs\nright on their website.\n\n54\n00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,190\nSo I'm just here on Rackspace's web\npage under their legal section, and\n\n55\n00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,200\nthey have different\nservice level agreements,\n\n56\n00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,580\ndepending on what it is that\nyou're buying from them, right?\n\n57\n00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,530\nSo if I'm doing cloud servers,\nI'll just jump here to cloud Servers.\n\n58\n00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,830\nThey talk about the network\ninfrastructure, and\n\n59\n00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,190\nthey guarantee that the network\nwill be available 100% of the time.\n\n60\n00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,013\nIn other words, they feel that they've\ndone enough redundancy in their network\n\n61\n00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,989\ntopology, that they'll never go down.\n\n62\n00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,060\nAnd then, their data center\ninfrastructure, their air conditioning,\n\n63\n00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,941\nand other resources there,\nwill be available 100 % of the time.\n\n64\n00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:12,120\nTheir cloud server hosts,\nthe physical servers.\n\n65\n00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,970\nIf there's a failure there they'll fix it.\n\n66\n00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,320\nFailures will happen,\nthat's what they're saying here, right?\n\n67\n00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,650\nThere's no 100% on this one.\n\n68\n00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,180\nFailures will happen, but\nthey'll resolve it, and\n\n69\n00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,840\nyou won't have to get involved, right?\n\n70\n00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400\nSame thing with migrations.\n\n71\n00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,010\nAnd they talk about credits.\n\n72\n00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,400\nIf they don't live up to that.\n\n73\n00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,700\nIf there is some kind of a failure.\n\n74\n00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,130\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin on that a little bit.\n\n75\n00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,560\nIf there is some kind of a failure, right,\nfor data center infrastructure 5% of\n\n76\n00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,350\nthe cloud server fees for each 30 minutes\nof infrastructure downtime up to 100% of\n\n77\n00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,190\nthe cloud server fees will be\ncredited to your account, right?\n\n78\n00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,922\nSo they know that\na problem could happen and\n\n79\n00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,710\nthey're gonna offer you credits for it.\n\n80\n00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,930\nWell, they'll monitor for that, right?\n\n81\n00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,140\nAnd they'll tell you,\nand they'll credit you.\n\n82\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,830\nBut don't you need to be sure?\n\n83\n00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,300\nI have this happen with my cable company.\n\n84\n00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,330\nMy cable company, they say, oh, yeah,\nwe'll credit you if there's an outage.\n\n85\n00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,380\nOutages happen all the time.\n\n86\n00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,707\nI mean, once a week my cable, it stinks.\n\n87\n00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,740\n[LAUGH] So it happens all the time,\nand they never credit me.\n\n88\n00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,370\nAnd so I call them.\n\n89\n00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,120\nI say, hey guys, I had this outage,\nand they go, oh yeah, here,\n\n90\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,160\nwe'll credit your account.\n\n91\n00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,790\nI've always gotta ask them.\n\n92\n00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,470\nIt's cuz they're a terrible company,\nright, and that's how it is.\n\n93\n00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,100\nRackspace, on the other hand,\nthey're a great company.\n\n94\n00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,090\nThey're very proactive about it.\n\n95\n00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,620\nAmazon, Microsoft.\n\n96\n00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,870\nBut we need to monitor it too.\n\n97\n00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,860\nAll right?\n\n98\n00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,520\nI need to know if my server's down.\n\n99\n00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880\nIf I have a server failure,\nRackspace is gonna take care of it for me.\n\n100\n00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,080\nBut I need to know that it happened, cuz\nthere might be downtime involved in that.\n\n101\n00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,980\nSo we need to have ways to watch for that.\n\n102\n00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,310\nAnd there's several different ways.\n\n103\n00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,640\nYou can go about this\na few different ways.\n\n104\n00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,100\nNow, there's monitoring solutions\n\n105\n00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,090\nbuilt into a lot of these\nproviders that you could use.\n\n106\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,710\nSo, if I wanted to monitor\nmy Amazon EC2 stuff, right?\n\n107\n00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,710\nSo like here I've got two\ninstances running in Amazon EC2.\n\n108\n00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,820\nThere's itprotv-web01 and web02.\n\n109\n00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,970\nI want to monitor them.\n\n110\n00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,050\nI want to know when they're up and\nhealthy and when they're not healthy.\n\n111\n00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,370\nWell Amazon monitors that.\n\n112\n00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,230\nI've got my little instance state\nright there, it's running, great.\n\n113\n00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,020\nBut just being on isn't enough, right.\n\n114\n00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,420\nJust having a server running isn't\nnecessarily exactly what I need.\n\n115\n00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,920\nI need to know more about it.\n\n116\n00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,710\nI need to know performance metrics and\nother things.\n\n117\n00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,700\nSo for that, we can enable their\nservice called CloudWatch, and\n\n118\n00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,890\nCloudWatch gives us detailed metrics\nof how that server's operating and\n\n119\n00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,420\nit records them historically.\n\n120\n00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,350\nThis is just a screen that I see,\nit's running great.\n\n121\n00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,290\nI need a history.\n\n122\n00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,390\nI need to know how that's been doing.\n\n123\n00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,260\nNot just for service level agreements,\nbut also for my own planning, right.\n\n124\n00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,940\nThere's a life cycle that all of our\nsolutions go through it and as more and\n\n125\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,230\nmore customers start to use your software,\nthe resources need to increase too.\n\n126\n00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,280\nIt's part of the life cycles.\n\n127\n00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,240\nWe have to increase the resources,\nbut how do I know when the increase?\n\n128\n00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,110\nI don't, I need to monitor that.\n\n129\n00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,050\nNow there's certain things that\nare monitored by Amazon by default and\n\n130\n00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,340\nit's things they bill for.\n\n131\n00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,570\nRight.\nThey monitor disk IO.\n\n132\n00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,710\nThey monitor bandwidth and they monitor\nhow many CPU cores you're using.\n\n133\n00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,320\nBut they don't monitor things like what\nprocesses are eating up your CPU or\n\n134\n00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,750\nhow much RAM you're using, because they\njust give you a fixed amount of RAM.\n\n135\n00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,390\nThey don't monitor details like that,\nit's up to us to monitor them.\n\n136\n00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,960\nAnd so we have two choices.\n\n137\n00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,850\nOne, we can use advanced\ntools from the vendor.\n\n138\n00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,525\nIf you trust the vendor,\nyou can use their tools, and that's great.\n\n139\n00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:23,010\nOr two,\nyou can use Use third party tools, and\n\n140\n00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,060\nthere's no end to the amount of\nthird party solutions out there\n\n141\n00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,320\nthat allow you to be able to monitor and\nsee what's going on in your systems.\n\n142\n00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,750\nCompanies like RightScale,\nVeeam, SolarWinds, these guys,\n\n143\n00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,700\nthey all make great monitoring solutions.\n\n144\n00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,040\nThey'll let you see how\nyour servers are doing.\n\n145\n00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,160\nSo in this show, I want to start\nby showing us the monitoring,\n\n146\n00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,030\nwe'll do it from within Amazon, so we'll\nget a chance to check out how they do it.\n\n147\n00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,640\nAnd then I'll show you a third\nparty monitoring solution also.\n\n148\n00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,320\nAnd then we'll double back and\nkinda touch on that whole\n\n149\n00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,550\nlifecycle thing cuz That's pretty\nimportant inside of our cloud environment.\n\n150\n00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,770\nAll right, so, these instances.\n\n151\n00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,290\nI wanna learn more about these instances.\n\n152\n00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,500\nWell, Amazon's only gonna monitor\nwhat it requires for billing.\n\n153\n00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,090\nIf I want more, I've gotta tell them that.\n\n154\n00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,830\nSo let me show you how that's done.\n\n155\n00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,730\nI've got this second instance here,\nitprotv-web02.\n\n156\n00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,380\nAnd if I select it, and I look down\nin this information here in the bar,\n\n157\n00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,230\nI can see its ID,\ninformation about it as far as its name.\n\n158\n00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,210\nAnd then under Alarm Status,\nsee how I've got this None.\n\n159\n00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,070\nThere's no alarm attached to it,\nthere's no\n\n160\n00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,010\ndetailed tracking of this system if\na problem occurs, there's nothing.\n\n161\n00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,220\nAmazon's gonna take care of problems and\nI may or\n\n162\n00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,900\nmay not even know about it, depending on\nhow quickly they resolve the problem.\n\n163\n00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,010\nWell, down here as I look at\nthe details for that system,\n\n164\n00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,690\nyou can see all sorts of information about\nit and what we're monitoring and so on.\n\n165\n00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,740\nAnd it's really pretty limited down here.\n\n166\n00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,628\nIf I go to the Monitoring tab, I can\nsee I'm getting CPU utilization, disk\n\n167\n00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:52,841\nreads and writes, and I'll see network\nright there, network in, all right?\n\n168\n00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:56,642\nBut there's no checks in\nhere as far as memory.\n\n169\n00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,243\nAs I scroll down, not a single of\nthese charts says anything about RAM.\n\n170\n00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,342\nAnd that's because Amazon\ndoesn't bill you based on that,\n\n171\n00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:03,463\nunless you're instance type.\n\n172\n00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,410\nThey give you a fixed amount of memory,\nand that's it.\n\n173\n00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,960\nIf I want more details I'm gonna\nset up those entries myself.\n\n174\n00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,090\nAnd up near the top,\n\n175\n00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,900\nI'll even see an option here we can\nenable detailed monitoring, right.\n\n176\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,040\nThis stuff down here is really for\nbilling purposes.\n\n177\n00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,660\nWe can use it, it's okay.\n\n178\n00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,730\nBut it's really only tracking these,\nI think it's every five minutes or\n\n179\n00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,070\nevery ten minutes.\n\n180\n00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,080\nSomething like that.\n\n181\n00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,540\nIt's not as often as you'd think.\n\n182\n00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,890\nWe might want something far more detailed.\n\n183\n00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,120\nAnd so Amazon's CloudWatch\nservice is what provides that.\n\n184\n00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,480\nIf I choose Enable Detailed Monitoring,\n\n185\n00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,690\nwhat that's gonna do is it's gonna\nturn on the full CloudWatch service.\n\n186\n00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,930\nAnd CloudWatch is free\nup to a certain point.\n\n187\n00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,390\nSo if you just had a handful of servers\nlike me, you can turn it on and\n\n188\n00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,360\nit's rare that you're gonna\nhave to pay anything.\n\n189\n00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,310\nBut if you've got thousands of servers,\nit'll start to incur cost.\n\n190\n00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,550\nSo be aware of that, that's why\nthey say additional charges apply.\n\n191\n00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,820\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nturn that on though, and\n\n192\n00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,430\nstarting now it's gonna record more\ndetailed information about the system.\n\n193\n00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,980\nSo, not just this data here, but\nit's gonna monitor it more often and\n\n194\n00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,090\nadditional data.\n\n195\n00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,730\nAnd I can start to create reports and,\nmore importantly,\n\n196\n00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,420\nI can create alerts that let me know when\nthere's certain problems, all right?\n\n197\n00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,830\nThat's really handy and\nthat's what we're seeing up here,\n\n198\n00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,350\nit's like there's no alarms\ndefined on this one.\n\n199\n00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,540\nI don't have any alerts cuz I wasn't\ndoing the detailed monitoring.\n\n200\n00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,620\nNow I am.\n\n201\n00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,090\nSo when I start to look at\nthis information down here,\n\n202\n00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,590\nI see a lot more detail.\n\n203\n00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,960\nNow I just turned it on, so\nwe're not gonna really see anything here.\n\n204\n00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,600\nAnd if I go to\nView All Cloud Watch Metrics,\n\n205\n00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,350\nwe'll start to see the breakdown of all\nthe different things that it can monitor.\n\n206\n00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,060\nSo, inside of EC2, there's metrics\non each individual instance,\n\n207\n00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,620\non my auto scaling groups, on my images.\n\n208\n00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,050\nYou can really drill down and\n\n209\n00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,310\nall the other Amazon services are laid\nout here too that we can monitor.\n\n210\n00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,380\nAnd if I go to Per-instance Metrics,\non a single\n\n211\n00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,730\nVM there's 256 different\nmetrics that are detected here.\n\n212\n00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,070\nNow, that number is so big.\n\n213\n00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,930\nIt's actually 65 metrics per instance.\n\n214\n00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,570\nAnd I've got two instances,\nthat you guys saw just a moment ago,\n\n215\n00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,380\nI must have two more that are either in\na different region, or terminated, or\n\n216\n00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,220\nsomething, so\nthat's why my number's so high.\n\n217\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,250\nBut 65 additional metrics for each one,\n\n218\n00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,300\nand you'll see like CPU,\nDisc Read, Network In, Out.\n\n219\n00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,990\nSo you start to see these laid out,\nand it's what is being monitored for\n\n220\n00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,280\nthese individual systems, and\nwe can start to tailor that, customize it.\n\n221\n00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,660\nAnd more importantly it's logging it.\n\n222\n00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,580\nSo we have a record,\n\n223\n00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,660\nwe can see this historical data and\nwe can start to create alarms.\n\n224\n00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,930\nThese alarms let us know when there's\na problem with the system, right?\n\n225\n00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,202\nSo for example, if I wanted to set\nup an alarm for one of my VMs, like,\n\n226\n00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:44,921\nI've already got this one alarmed for\nitprotv-web01.\n\n227\n00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:48,696\nBut let's say I wanted to\nsetup a CPU alarm for web02 so\n\n228\n00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:53,770\nthat when CPU utilization reached\na certain level that it would notify me.\n\n229\n00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,940\nNow, Amazon doesn't know if that\nCPU utilization is good or bad.\n\n230\n00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,310\nThey don't know our software,\nthey don't know what we're doing.\n\n231\n00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,830\nSo it might be expected that yeah,\n\n232\n00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,110\nwe're at high utilization one day,\nbut they just let it run.\n\n233\n00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,880\nWe know that while it shouldn't be that\nhigh, let me know when that happens.\n\n234\n00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,910\nSo we create those alarms.\n\n235\n00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,060\nNow we get that detailed\nvision inside of our systems.\n\n236\n00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,920\nSo if I go back over the EC2 and\nI take my instance,\n\n237\n00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,170\nmy Web02 instance and\nI go to my Monitoring tab, right?\n\n238\n00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,080\nIt says right here,\nCloudWatch alarms, none configured.\n\n239\n00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,600\nAnd I can configure an alarm right here,\nand\n\n240\n00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,750\nI'm basically gonna tell it what\nit is that I want to monitor.\n\n241\n00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,920\nSo I'm gonna tell it I need to\nmonitor Average CPU utilization,\n\n242\n00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,770\nor disk reads, or network,\nor status check failed any.\n\n243\n00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,680\nIf the virtual machine were to freeze,\nif it were to shut down,\n\n244\n00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,440\nthose are things that will cause\nthe status checks to fail.\n\n245\n00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,970\nThose will actually reflect things\nlike availability zones changing and\n\n246\n00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,740\nstuff like that too.\n\n247\n00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,750\nSo really, really good ones to monitor.\n\n248\n00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,590\nWe can monitor all of this and\ngenerate alert messages back.\n\n249\n00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,920\nSo I'll say, CPU Utilization,\nif I have an average\n\n250\n00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,100\nof 80% for two consecutive periods.\n\n251\n00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,471\nWell, actually, let's go like three\nconsecutive periods of one minute,\n\n252\n00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:16,650\nit's gonna check every one minute, every\n60 seconds, what's my CPU utilization?\n\n253\n00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,122\nAnd if it's over 80% three times in a row,\nit's gonna send me an alert.\n\n254\n00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,760\nIt's gonna send me an alert,\nit's gonna let me know.\n\n255\n00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,910\nOr maybe I don't need it to\nbe that frequent or whatever.\n\n256\n00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,540\nYou can adjust these\nnumbers however you need.\n\n257\n00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,090\nAnd then we can give it a name,\nI always rename these so\n\n258\n00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,450\nit's something I can actually remember.\n\n259\n00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,950\nSo I just put Web 02 CPU utilization.\n\n260\n00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,560\nOver here I see my recent history,\nso I can get an idea.\n\n261\n00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,320\nAm I about to create an alert\nthat's already gonna be triggered?\n\n262\n00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,470\nIt's kinda pointless.\n\n263\n00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,520\nAnd then right now it's set\nto send a notification to me.\n\n264\n00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,470\nRight?\nSo it's gonna email.\n\n265\n00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,500\nYou can set it up to do other things\nlike text messages and stuff.\n\n266\n00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,670\nIt has all sorts of support there.\n\n267\n00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,062\nNow I've got the alarm created.\n\n268\n00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,430\nAnd it's in there.\n\n269\n00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,230\nIf that server starts to have excessive\nutilization, I'll get a notice.\n\n270\n00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,120\nIt'll let me know.\n\n271\n00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,452\nIt's something that Amazon might ignore,\ncuz they think it might be a legitimate\n\n272\n00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,610\ntraffic, but we know isn't right,\nand we can spot that.\n\n273\n00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,640\nNow, I wanna show you guys one\nof those alarms getting set,\n\n274\n00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,100\nso what I'm gonna do is\nif I go to CloudWatch.\n\n275\n00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,800\nIf I jump over to my CloudWatch system.\n\n276\n00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,090\nI can see my alarms, and see how I've\ngot OK 3, everything's on the up and\n\n277\n00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,150\nup, right?\n\n278\n00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,910\nI wanna set off one of those alarms, so\nI'm gonna connect to one of my servers.\n\n279\n00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,140\nAnd let me connect to, I'll do web01,\n\n280\n00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,031\njust cuz I've been monitoring it longer.\n\n281\n00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:40,844\nWeb01 is an instance that I've been\nrunning for probably about 24 hours, and\n\n282\n00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:43,740\nthat one's got a little more traffic and\nactivity behind it.\n\n283\n00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,883\nSo I'll connect to that one,\nit'll give us a little better data.\n\n284\n00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:50,085\nLet me just get into DNS names so\nI can remote into it.\n\n285\n00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:51,295\nAnd we'll get a chance to see that.\n\n286\n00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:55,175\nNow if I were to pull up it's cloud\nwatch logs, when I go down in here and\n\n287\n00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:55,775\nstart to look at it.\n\n288\n00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,082\nSee I've got just a lot\nmore history available,\n\n289\n00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,396\nabout how this one's been\nrunning as far as CPU.\n\n290\n00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:05,838\nAnd my CP utilization, see how it's\nbeen below 1% all this time, right?\n\n291\n00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,955\nSo it's really pretty low.\n\n292\n00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:10,185\nActually it's been as high as 8% I guess.\n\n293\n00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:13,520\nBut on average this\none's idling pretty low.\n\n294\n00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,040\nI'm gonna remote into that server and\nI'm really gonna crank it up.\n\n295\n00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,130\nI'm gonna peg it out at 100% CPU.\n\n296\n00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,770\nNow the monitor, the alert that I have for\nthat server, if I go back to my\n\n297\n00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,120\nalerts for this guy, so\nif I jump back over to CloudWatch.\n\n298\n00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600\nOh, shoot.\nI could have used a shortcut\n\n299\n00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,620\nthere but whatever.\n\n300\n00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,040\nSo if I jump over and take a look\nat itprotv-web01-CPU-Utilization\n\n301\n00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,490\nI've got that one set so\n\n302\n00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,620\nthat if the CPU utilization is\ngreater than 80% for two minutes.\n\n303\n00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,650\nAll right so I'm gonna go ahead and\npeg out it's CPU and\n\n304\n00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,810\nI'm going to set it to peg out for\nmore than two minutes.\n\n305\n00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,901\nSo I'll use a little Linux command called\nstress which will let me peg out a CPU.\n\n306\n00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,410\nNow I've only got one processor in\nthe system, so I'm gonna peg out one CPU.\n\n307\n00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,840\nAnd I'm gonna tell it to do that for\n180 seconds.\n\n308\n00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,360\nThat's three minutes.\n\n309\n00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,590\nSo for three minutes I'm gonna\npeg out the CPU on this system.\n\n310\n00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,200\nIt's gonna hit 100% CPU and\nit's gonna float there.\n\n311\n00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,030\nWell, two minutes from now,\nI'll have failed two checks.\n\n312\n00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,930\nI'll have been over 80% for\ntwo and it'll send me an email.\n\n313\n00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,460\nIt'll let me know.\n\n314\n00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,440\nAll right?\n\n315\n00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,990\nSo I'm gonna, let me move my cell phone so\nit's a little closer.\n\n316\n00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,710\nI'll hear it vibrate, so I'll know.\n\n317\n00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,060\nAnd then,\nwe'll be able to see that alert kick off.\n\n318\n00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,690\nNow while we're waiting on that,\n\n319\n00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,780\nmonitoring performance is one thing,\nmonitoring billing is another.\n\n320\n00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,710\nAnd this is one that a lot\nof us don't think of in IT,\n\n321\n00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,950\nthese instances cost me money.\n\n322\n00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,970\nWhat if somebody hacks into my account And\nit spends up 1,000 instances and\n\n323\n00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,230\nstarts BitCoin mining?\n\n324\n00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,550\nI'm gonna pay for that.\n\n325\n00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,221\n>> Yeah, that's gonna cost\nyou a couple bucks [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:52,190\n>> Real CPU intensive, and if they\nhack in they're probably gonna pick\n\n327\n00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,781\nthe biggest instance possible, the ones\nwith all the GPUs attached or something.\n\n328\n00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:57,211\nThey're gonna go crazy with it.\n\n329\n00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:58,992\nSo, that's a problem.\n\n330\n00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,947\nSo, I might wanna setup billing\nmonitors to let me know when\n\n331\n00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,720\nI reach a certain price or whatever.\n\n332\n00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,480\nAnd Cloud Watch can do that, I've\nactually got one of these setup already.\n\n333\n00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,830\nIf I go here into my billing,\nI've got a billing alarm set.\n\n334\n00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,590\nAnd basically,\nif I ever estimate a charge of $50 for\n\n335\n00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,100\na 6 hour period,\nI want it to send me an alert.\n\n336\n00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,090\nIf it looks in the next six hours and\nsays, based on what you've currently done,\n\n337\n00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,520\nyou're gonna be at $50 for this 6 hour\nperiod, it's gonna send me a warning.\n\n338\n00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,400\nIf somebody hacks in and\nstarts spinning up instances,\n\n339\n00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,720\nthis alarm will flag really quick and\nit can send me an alert.\n\n340\n00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,920\nIt's a pretty neat way to go about it.\n\n341\n00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,100\nThey also have a billing management\npage that you can pull up.\n\n342\n00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,960\nThis guy right here, where you can see,\nhere's my route 53 cost,\n\n343\n00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,580\nhere's my S3 cost,\nhere's some of the other costs, and\n\n344\n00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,240\nit's forecasting like what these\nthings are gonna cost me down the line\n\n345\n00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,970\nbased on what I've used so far and\nit kind of lays out as to which service.\n\n346\n00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,530\nSo this type of monitoring is really\nhandy to be able to see your cost and\n\n347\n00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,000\nanticipate what that bill's gonna\nbe at the end of the month.\n\n348\n00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,025\nNow I'm showing all of this in\nAmazon AWS but is the same thing for\n\n349\n00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,755\nMicrosoft Azure, Rackspace,\nall the other guys Google Compute,\n\n350\n00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:14,075\nthey've all got monitoring just like this\nbuilt into their system that you can use.\n\n351\n00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,045\nAnd track your systems make\nsure they're operational,\n\n352\n00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:17,495\nthat they're doing what\nthey're supposed to.\n\n353\n00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,450\nBut, it never hurts to be paranoid.\n\n354\n00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,020\nYou don't have to rely on\nthem to do the monitoring.\n\n355\n00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,250\nWe could step outside and\nsay, let's use a third party.\n\n356\n00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,860\nRight?\n\n357\n00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,770\nThere's companies like ylastic.\n\n358\n00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,420\nI used ylastic for years.\n\n359\n00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,460\nThese guys connect to S3 and\nwill reflect all sorts of information.\n\n360\n00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,800\nSo here they're laying out your\ncosts based on reserved instances,\n\n361\n00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,270\non demand, and so on.\n\n362\n00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,180\nSo you can track what your\nexpenses are going to be, or\n\n363\n00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,890\nyou can break it down even more.\n\n364\n00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,840\nLet me go to their little features page.\n\n365\n00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,930\nAnd they'll show like right here where\nthey're laying out your current spend,\n\n366\n00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,700\nhow much you've spent this month and\nwhat your final bill is going to be.\n\n367\n00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,670\nThey lay out all of this information.\n\n368\n00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,990\nThey're taking stuff that's readily\navailable to you in the console for\n\n369\n00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,880\nAWS in this example.\n\n370\n00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,620\nButt they're putting in\na human readable format,\n\n371\n00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,350\na nice little chart makes\nit really easy to manage.\n\n372\n00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,940\nAnd you can start to anticipate things\nlike performance and billing and so on.\n\n373\n00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,480\n>> And Don, it looks like you obviously\nhave some advantage using one of these\n\n374\n00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,330\ntype of services specially the built in\nones Amazon or Azure or whatever, because\n\n375\n00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,370\nyou can monitor things like billing,\nwhereas in a traditional monitoring system\n\n376\n00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,330\nsomething like SolarWinds wouldn't\nbe able to do that, right?\n\n377\n00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,410\n>> Yeah that's true, but\nthere's still a place for SolarWinds,\n\n378\n00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,320\nthere's still a place for products\nlike that because, notice as I went\n\n379\n00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,870\nthrough here, I still didn't see\nthings like, what service is it,\n\n380\n00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,720\nthat's pegging out my CPU, or\nhow much memory am I actually consuming?\n\n381\n00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,790\nI didn't see those items,\nthose weren't in the list.\n\n382\n00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,860\nSo if I want to monitor details inside\nof the virtual machines themselves,\n\n383\n00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,500\nI'm going to want things like SolarWinds.\n\n384\n00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,330\nI'll show you guys SolarWinds, but\nlet's go double check my error and\n\n385\n00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,790\nsee if it's flagged yet.\n\n386\n00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,660\nLet me go refresh my\nCloud Watch screen and\n\n387\n00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,720\nsure enough,\nI've got an alarm sitting right there.\n\n388\n00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,920\nI missed the vibrate on my phone I\nmust have it completely silenced.\n\n389\n00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,590\nBut so\nthere's that alarm that just kicked off.\n\n390\n00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,500\nI've got a billing alarm, oh no wait.\n\n391\n00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,370\nI'm billing okay.\n\n392\n00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,100\nWhere's my actual alarm, there we go.\n\n393\n00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,360\nItprotv web01 CP Utilization, right?\n\n394\n00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,940\nI pegged out that CPU for\ntwo minutes, now I've got an alarm.\n\n395\n00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940\nNow eventually that alarm is gonna clear,\n\n396\n00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,680\nif I go back here,\nyeah that process is already done.\n\n397\n00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,640\nSo when I pass two more checks,\nthe alarm will clear and go away.\n\n398\n00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,630\nBut now I can actually see that I\nhave a problem with my systems,\n\n399\n00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,300\nI know about that, and I can deal with it.\n\n400\n00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,330\nDaniel was mentioning SolarWinds,\na third party product.\n\n401\n00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,190\nThey could have monitored this too, and\nhonestly it would have done a better job.\n\n402\n00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,200\nI really do like SolarWinds.\n\n403\n00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,350\nIt's expensive, but if you can get it\nin your budget, it's great software.\n\n404\n00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,780\nIf you've never seen it,\n\n405\n00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,530\nthey have a program called\nSolarWinds Network Performance Monitor.\n\n406\n00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,630\nAnd it allows you to load in all\nyour servers, your network switches,\n\n407\n00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,690\nyour routers, your firewalls, and\n\n408\n00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,705\nit uses SNMP to monitor all sorts\nof information about your systems.\n\n409\n00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:03,975\nAnd you can map it out, and\n\n410\n00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:07,265\nyou get these great red light\ngreen light views of your network.\n\n411\n00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:10,465\nAnd so if you see a red light, like we've\ngot a red light down here in Texas.\n\n412\n00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:14,045\nWe can click on that and jump in, and\nwe can start to see our different systems.\n\n413\n00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,525\nI can say, all right, where's the problem?\n\n414\n00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,805\nWell, I've got,\nthis location has a problem.\n\n415\n00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,475\nLet me jump into it.\n\n416\n00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,315\nAnd I can start to see the nodes there.\n\n417\n00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,475\nAnd over here I've got all the nodes.\n\n418\n00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,730\nI've got three, that have a problem.\n\n419\n00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,130\nLooks like one shut off.\n\n420\n00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,770\nIt's got a little black box on it.\n\n421\n00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,480\nBut the other ones,\nlike if I look at [INAUDIBLE],\n\n422\n00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,910\nlooks like we've got some\nkind of outage on this one.\n\n423\n00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,530\nAnd it's actually trying to\njump me over to that system, so\n\n424\n00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,860\nlet's pick something else.\n\n425\n00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,550\nOh, nope, there it goes.\n\n426\n00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,770\nSo it's gonna jump over.\n\n427\n00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,210\nAnd I'm gonna get not just the current\ninformation about the system, but\n\n428\n00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,300\nthe historical information too.\n\n429\n00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,150\nI can see this one's been offline for\n\n430\n00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,640\na while, I've got 100% packet\nloss over the last 12 hours.\n\n431\n00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,730\nAnd I can start to change that\nscale to look back longer,\n\n432\n00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,980\ngo back a week, a month, whatever.\n\n433\n00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980\nHow long has this been down?\n\n434\n00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,741\nIf I jump to 24 hours which I guess is\nwhat I'm viewing, cuz that didn't change.\n\n435\n00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:10,730\n[LAUGH] And\nthey've disabled the custom button.\n\n436\n00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,680\nAnd this is a demo panel\nthey've given me here.\n\n437\n00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,400\nThere's normally a customize\nbutton where you can jump in and\n\n438\n00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,930\nchange that time frame to go even further.\n\n439\n00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,760\nBut as we start to look at this data,\nI can see this system is down and\n\n440\n00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,340\nthen go and troubleshoot it.\n\n441\n00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,140\nBut if a system were up.\n\n442\n00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,230\nSo if I go and\n\n443\n00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,370\nfind a, let me find some node that\nis up instead of one that's down.\n\n444\n00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,600\nThis will take somebody,\n\n445\n00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,830\nlet's take one of these, looks like we got\nlow, you know all these guys have errors.\n\n446\n00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,135\nDo they have any healthy systems?\n\n447\n00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:43,820\n[LAUGH] Is that too much to ask?\n\n448\n00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,620\nYou need a healthy system.\n\n449\n00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,660\nLet me take this.\n\n450\n00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,680\nThis one's got a cool name, Baboo.\n\n451\n00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,170\nAnd so we'll take this guy and\nwhen we drill into one of these severs,\n\n452\n00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,290\nwe start to get information about network\nlatency, response time as far as pings,\n\n453\n00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,600\ndisk IO information,\nnetwork bandwidth, memory and so on.\n\n454\n00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,850\nAnd we can really drill down and\nspot that.\n\n455\n00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,940\nSo, they've got a lot\nof network monitoring.\n\n456\n00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,630\nLet me find something.\n\n457\n00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,580\nHere, disk space used.\n\n458\n00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,630\nYou know, how's my hard drive\nutilization turning along?\n\n459\n00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,640\nWe've got average response times and\npacket loss, top five applications.\n\n460\n00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,970\nWill it let me break that out?\n\n461\n00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,860\nThere we go.\n\n462\n00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,810\nSo here's my top\napplications on this system.\n\n463\n00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,970\nIf this system is busy and is running low\non memory, who's getting all the memory?\n\n464\n00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,100\nWell here I can find out, on this one,\nit's the web server, right?\n\n465\n00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,430\nBut DNS, Net BIOS, SNP, MSNP, those are\nall in here too, as consuming resources.\n\n466\n00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,620\nAnd I can start to spot that and\nreally figure out why this server is what,\n\n467\n00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,800\nin a certain situation and we can drill\nthis down to get more detailed data.\n\n468\n00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,992\nIf we wanna zoom in on periods, it's\nreally neat stuff, really easy to set up.\n\n469\n00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,900\nThat's SolarWind's claim to fame, they're\nexpensive, but it is insanely easy.\n\n470\n00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,870\nYou can do all of this with free software.\n\n471\n00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,260\nThings like Nagios, Nagios can do all of\nthis, but it's a nightmare to get setup.\n\n472\n00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,712\nOnce you get it setup it works just as\nwell as SolarWinds, but it's so much work.\n\n473\n00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:06,570\nWith SolarWinds they've got all\nthese templates and things.\n\n474\n00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,650\nYou just flip it on.\n\n475\n00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,200\nYou'll be up and\nrunning in an hour with Solar Winds.\n\n476\n00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,035\nBut Nagios, it's gonna take you a few\ndays, weeks, whatever to get that set up.\n\n477\n00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,880\n>> [LAUGH] And you don't lose your\nweb based functionality, right?\n\n478\n00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,140\nThat whole SolarWinds page is\nall through a web interface.\n\n479\n00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,148\nSo you're still using any computers\nyou're at and just go to,\n\n480\n00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,951\nI think it's the Orion servers that they\ncall them or something like that and you\n\n481\n00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:30,952\nare going to give you a web interface just\nyour name password and you're logged in.\n\n482\n00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,779\nSo it doesn't matter where you're at,\nmaybe your at a client computer,\n\n483\n00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,830\nat a different server, not a problem.\n\n484\n00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,218\n>> Now the other thing that I want\nto mention when it comes to service\n\n485\n00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,870\nmanagement, when a service is in\nproduction, you need to track it.\n\n486\n00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,270\nMake sure,\nis it responding in a timely manner?\n\n487\n00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,941\nIs it operational?\n\n488\n00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,202\nAre the servers up?\n\n489\n00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:49,243\nIs my billing right?\n\n490\n00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:52,004\nThat's all stuff we need to watch for\nproduction service.\n\n491\n00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:57,690\nBut production is merely one\nstage in a service's life cycle.\n\n492\n00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,050\nIf any of you guys have done ITIL\ntraining or anything like that,\n\n493\n00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,600\nyou've kind of seen this\nservice life cycle before.\n\n494\n00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,000\nBut, your service life cycle\nreally consists of five stages and\n\n495\n00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,180\nI'm gonna say the five\nstages I normally do.\n\n496\n00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,940\nDepending on what standard you follow,\nyou might have different stages.\n\n497\n00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,310\nYou might have more or less or\njust different names for the same ones.\n\n498\n00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,590\nBut typically when we create a new\nservice, like let's say I work for\n\n499\n00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,940\na company and we're creating some new web\napplication that calculates golf scores or\n\n500\n00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,577\nsomething lame like that.\n\n501\n00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:29,120\nAnd you start out in development, right?\n\n502\n00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,000\nAnd the development stage, this is, you've\ngot programmers that are trying to create\n\n503\n00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,590\nsomething and\nthey're not doing the greatest job.\n\n504\n00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,900\nAnd I don't mean they're doing bad work,\n\n505\n00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,410\nI mean they're not optimizing\nthe code to run fast.\n\n506\n00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,860\nThey're not doing security audits.\n\n507\n00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,780\nThey're trying to get it to work.\n\n508\n00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,060\nIn the early stages of development,\nyou're just trying to create a prototype,\n\n509\n00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,140\nyou're trying to get\nthe service where it'll work.\n\n510\n00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,890\nAnd then once it works, then you\noptimize it for speed and performance.\n\n511\n00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,500\nThen you optimize it for\nsecurity and so on.\n\n512\n00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,980\nSo the first stage in a life\ncycle is development, dev.\n\n513\n00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,320\nThen we move into test.\n\n514\n00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,280\nIn the testing phase,\nhere's where you're optimizing it.\n\n515\n00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,390\nHere's where you're testing it out,\ngetting some users to get in there,\n\n516\n00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,200\ngiving you some basic feedback.\n\n517\n00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,495\nJust doing Basic testing, all right?\n\n518\n00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:17,445\nUnit testing,\nwhatever it is that you wanna call it.\n\n519\n00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:21,265\nThen, when things are looking pretty good,\nall right, it's optimized,\n\n520\n00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:22,885\nit's secure,\nit does what it's supposed to do.\n\n521\n00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,016\nIt's looking pretty good.\n\n522\n00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,136\nWe move to our third stage,\nwhich is Q&A, right?\n\n523\n00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:32,040\nQuality assurance, quality control.\n\n524\n00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,490\nIt really is technically quality\nassurance, it doesn't matter.\n\n525\n00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,330\nBut, you're evaluating it for quality.\n\n526\n00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,460\nYou get it reviewed.\n\n527\n00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,890\nThis is where if you have\nIT Security officers,\n\n528\n00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,440\nthey review, is it actually secure?\n\n529\n00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,220\nCan we poke any holes in it?\n\n530\n00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220\nAnd the QA team run some users through it.\n\n531\n00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,170\nThey look for bugs,\nthey look for problems.\n\n532\n00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,780\nThey look for for any kind of issue that\nmight occur there so that you can fix it.\n\n533\n00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,090\nOnce that's all squared away.\n\n534\n00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,540\nAnd if something is broken,\nyou leave QA and you go back to test.\n\n535\n00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,580\nYou go back to test, you fix\nthe problem and you go to QA again.\n\n536\n00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,690\nOnce you pass QA, then you move to\nthe fourth stage, which is staging.\n\n537\n00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,170\nNow, what staging is, is a mirror\nimage of your production environment.\n\n538\n00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,240\nIf you have 100 servers in production\nthat are configured a certain way,\n\n539\n00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720\nin staging you've got 100 servers\nthat are configured a certain way.\n\n540\n00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,430\nIt's a mirror image of your\nproduction environment.\n\n541\n00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,280\nAnd if it's 100 all duplicate servers,\nyou don't need 100 of them.\n\n542\n00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,600\nIt's for scale.\n\n543\n00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,790\nBut the configurations\nneed to be identical.\n\n544\n00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,400\nAll right?\n\n545\n00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,150\nSo, you then put\nthe software into staging.\n\n546\n00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,163\nAnd the reason you're doing it there is\nsometimes we test in one environment,\n\n547\n00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:37,721\nthings work great and then you move\nit to your production server and\n\n548\n00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,650\nsomething's broken.\n\n549\n00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,700\nThere was something that wasn't planned.\n\n550\n00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,480\nSo, when you put the software in staging,\nyou're looking to make sure that it\n\n551\n00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,070\nstill works, and\nthat it doesn't break any other service.\n\n552\n00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,120\nI may have some other service running and\nthis new service interferes with it.\n\n553\n00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,850\nAnd I didn't see that in testing and QA,\ncuz I was focused in on my one service.\n\n554\n00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,770\nIn staging we see it, all right?\n\n555\n00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,180\nSo, we work out our kinks there.\n\n556\n00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,040\nWe make sure everything's fine in staging.\n\n557\n00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,550\nNow our code is completely tested and\nsafe, we move it into production.\n\n558\n00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,930\nIn production, now it's available to our\ncustomers out there in the real world.\n\n559\n00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,290\nThat's the final stage and then I guess\nyou could technically say there was one\n\n560\n00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,180\nmore stage which is disposition, which is\nwhen you're done with it, you toss it and\n\n561\n00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,660\nyou get rid of it,\nreplace it with something new.\n\n562\n00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,030\nBut that's like an unofficial stage.\n\n563\n00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:24,740\nSo, those five environments: dev,\ntest, QA, staging, production.\n\n564\n00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,880\nThat's five sets of servers.\n\n565\n00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,840\nWhen you're in dev,\n\n566\n00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,690\nthat server, it might be a virtual machine\nrunning right on somebody's laptop.\n\n567\n00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,050\nYour developers might\njust be doing it locally.\n\n568\n00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,220\nTest though?\n\n569\n00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,440\nThat test, that's gonna be some servers.\n\n570\n00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,620\nQ&A.\n\n571\n00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,370\nIt's definitely gotta be servers there,\ncuz you've got people in and evaluating.\n\n572\n00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,859\nYou gotta see what it looks\nlike on a real server.\n\n573\n00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,070\nStaging, that's a mirror\nimage of production.\n\n574\n00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,140\nSo, if we're doing this ourselves, we have\n20 production servers that are right here\n\n575\n00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,150\nthat are physical, HP ProLiant Servers.\n\n576\n00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,850\nThen my staging is gonna be\nthose same HP ProLiant servers.\n\n577\n00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,650\nThat's a separate set.\n\n578\n00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,590\nIt costs me twice as much.\n\n579\n00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,190\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n580\n00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,274\nAnd then production,\nthose are the big ones.\n\n581\n00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:07,940\nSo, If we're using the cloud,\nit's possible that we can put\n\n582\n00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,920\ncertain stages of that life cycle into the\ncloud to save us money, save us resources.\n\n583\n00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,560\nAll right?\n\n584\n00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,040\nFor example,\nmy production might be in the cloud,\n\n585\n00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,910\njust to take advantage of all\nthe stuff that we've talked about.\n\n586\n00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,280\nMy staging might be in the cloud, but\n\n587\n00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,610\nwhen I'm not testing new software,\nI shut it down.\n\n588\n00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,450\nDo I need the staging to be up and\nrunning all the time?\n\n589\n00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,830\nCustomers aren't in it.\n\n590\n00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,680\nIf we're at the end of a two week sprint\nand we're ready to push some data out,\n\n591\n00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,770\nwe need to test it in staging.\n\n592\n00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,910\nBut if we're in week one\nof a two week sprint,\n\n593\n00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,900\nwe can shut the whole staging\nenvironment down and save money.\n\n594\n00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,480\nSo that's a way that we can\nleverage the cloud for that.\n\n595\n00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480\nWell, do you monitor\nthose staging servers?\n\n596\n00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,150\nDo you need to keep track of them?\n\n597\n00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,610\nYou do, cuz they cost you money.\n\n598\n00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,510\nSo you monitor billing.\n\n599\n00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,090\nYou're not so worried about performance,\nbut you are worried about spending money.\n\n600\n00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,840\nSo, when we talk about service management,\nit's not just the production servers that\n\n601\n00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,550\nwe worry about,\nit's the whole life cycle of systems.\n\n602\n00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,600\nDev, that's likely gonna stay local.\n\n603\n00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,210\nYour developer's working\non their own machine.\n\n604\n00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,760\nThen when they get into test, QA,\nstaging, that may all be in the cloud.\n\n605\n00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,560\nIt may be isolated in the cloud,\nor it might be local and\n\n606\n00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,810\nproduction is in the cloud.\n\n607\n00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,520\nBut they can be any mixture of the two.\n\n608\n00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,660\nSo, if you have a mixture, all of a sudden\nthings like the Amazon cloud watch stuff\n\n609\n00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,340\ndoesn't work so well anymore.\n\n610\n00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,580\nRight, cuz it monitors Amazon.\n\n611\n00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,080\nIt doesn't monitor stuff\nyou're running locally.\n\n612\n00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,640\nBut that SolarWinds software that starts\nto shine, cuz it can monitor anything.\n\n613\n00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,650\nSo, or Veeam or RightScale or any of\nthose guys that are out there same thing.\n\n614\n00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,760\nThey can monitor anything.\n\n615\n00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,610\nThey don't care which provider use.\n\n616\n00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,750\nSo, you gotta make sure you choose\nthe right monitoring solution to cover\n\n617\n00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,350\nthe environments you're deploying and that\nyou have that right solution in place.\n\n618\n00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,290\nAnd just keep in mind that there's\nmore than just production.\n\n619\n00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,470\nThere's these five stages\nof the life cycle.\n\n620\n00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,280\nAnd any one, or all of them,\ncould be in the cloud too.\n\n621\n00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,270\n>> Well Don,\nthis has been a really good episode about\n\n622\n00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,100\nmaking sure we're keeping an eye on\nthe things that we're trying to watch.\n\n623\n00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,750\nAnd to make sure that\nit's running correctly.\n\n624\n00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:08,410\nBecause, it is real easy for us to kind\nof sit back and let the show run itself.\n\n625\n00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,460\nNot really what you wanna do.\n\n626\n00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,520\nAnd it's great that the cloud services,\n\n627\n00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,550\nthey do provide us at least\nsome type of monitoring.\n\n628\n00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,370\nAnd there are third-party apps as well.\n\n629\n00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,040\nSo, we can even do like a hybrid\ntype of deal if you need to do that.\n\n630\n00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,180\nVery great stuff.\n\n631\n00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,520\nHave we covered the basics on this?\n\n632\n00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,310\n>> Yeah.\nThat's basically it.\n\n633\n00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,053\nI mean,\nobviously there's a lot more details for\n\n634\n00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:27,690\nmonitoring particular services and stuff.\n\n635\n00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,160\nBut for this episode,\nwe're trying to stay general.\n\n636\n00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,041\nThat's a pretty good [CROSSTALK].\n\n637\n00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:31,700\n>> Awesome.\n\n638\n00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,980\nWell I guess, that being said,\n\n639\n00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,670\nwe've come to the end of another great\nepisode signing off for ITProTV.\n\n640\n00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,480\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n641\n00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n642\n00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,138\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n643\n00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:46,172\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,140\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,602\nHere with me today is Don Pazet.\n\n6\n00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:18,540\nHow you doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,660\n>> I am doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,744\nI'm excited to launch\ninto this episode and\n\n9\n00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:24,400\nwe're gonna start talking\nabout Amazon Web Services.\n\n10\n00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840\nGreat services available out there\nas a cloud hosting provider and\n\n11\n00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,801\nsomething that people really\nneed to get introduced to.\n\n12\n00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:33,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,700\nAWS Amazon, they handle some\npretty heavy hitters out there.\n\n14\n00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,600\nSo don't just think that oh,\nI'm too little, I don't need AWS.\n\n15\n00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,701\nThey'll go from just as small as you\nwanna be to as large as you wanna be.\n\n16\n00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,020\nI know Netflix is one of their\ntheir users and stuff like that.\n\n17\n00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,380\nVery, very scalable.\n\n18\n00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,146\n>> Yeah, it's funny when when you think\nabout a cloud data center provider,\n\n19\n00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:56,381\nyou wouldn't think of an online e-retailer\nas the person who would head that up.\n\n20\n00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:00,222\nYou'd think of companies,\nlike Microsoft or Dell, HP.\n\n21\n00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:06,120\nThose are companies that have supported\ndata centers for years and years.\n\n22\n00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,537\nWhy aren't they at the head of that curve?\n\n23\n00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:11,758\nAnd the reason is that curve didn't\nreally exist before what Amazon did and\n\n24\n00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,042\nwhat happened at Amazon is pretty neat.\n\n25\n00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:17,381\nAmazon is the largest online\nretailer in the world.\n\n26\n00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,657\nThey handle more transactions\nthan anybody else and\n\n27\n00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:23,180\nthey have customers all over the globe,\nthat requires a lot of infrastructure.\n\n28\n00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,528\nSo they have to have a lot of servers and\ndatabases and high redundancy,\n\n29\n00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:32,540\nhigh availability, all over the globe to\nsupport just their online store front.\n\n30\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,140\nAmazon has no physical stores.\n\n31\n00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,500\nSo if their website goes down,\nthey stop making money.\n\n32\n00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,320\nIt's real important for\nthat to be up and stable.\n\n33\n00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,038\nSo as they built that out for\nthemselves, they built out a lot of\n\n34\n00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,055\ngreat infrastructure and\na lot of it was overkill,\n\n35\n00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:51,640\ncuz they had to be able to handle all\nthe peaks of customer activity and stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,130\nSo they looked at it, they said,\nwe build out this great infrastructure.\n\n37\n00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,492\nWe don't use all of it, we could recoup\nsome of that cost by renting it out to\n\n38\n00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:05,139\nother people and that's kind of how Amazon\nWeb Services started was renting out\n\n39\n00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,110\nexcess resources that they had.\n\n40\n00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,987\nAnd in the early, early days,\nyou just got what were called spot,\n\n41\n00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:14,811\nwhich was if Amazon wasn't using\ntheir server, then you could.\n\n42\n00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,550\nBut if Amazon was using it,\nyou didn't get it.\n\n43\n00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,139\nBut as time went on, this became its\nown self-sustaining business unit and\n\n44\n00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:25,729\nthey started adding servers dedicated\njust for AWS, resources that Amazon\n\n45\n00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,674\nthemselves didn't use that they\nmade available to the public and\n\n46\n00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:33,530\nit turned into a multibillion\ndollar operation for them.\n\n47\n00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,180\nAnd now they handle clients big and\nsmall, large, small.\n\n48\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,280\nTons of information moves\nthrough Amazon every single day.\n\n49\n00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,590\nThey are the single largest\nonline data center provider now.\n\n50\n00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,390\n>> Yeah, they've definitely\ngot a great thing going.\n\n51\n00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,912\nYou wouldn't think these book sellers\nwould have such an infrastructure\n\n52\n00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:53,034\nbuilt up, but it really makes sense\nwhen you start thinking about\n\n53\n00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:56,440\nlike what Don was just saying,\nthat they needed that online presence,\n\n54\n00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,310\nthey needed to have that presence\nthat would never go down.\n\n55\n00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,931\nOr at least if it ever did,\nvery, very, minimal time.\n\n56\n00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,810\nSo having that leftover and\nwe all know about that.\n\n57\n00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,114\nIf you've worked in any data center,\neven a small one, you say, hey,\n\n58\n00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:12,050\nI've actually got to buy a server and\nI'm not not using it all.\n\n59\n00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,167\nMaybe we're running a website and\nI need two servers,\n\n60\n00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,411\nbecause one won't do it at peak times.\n\n61\n00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:21,215\nSo I have one server basically sitting\naround all day instead of being used until\n\n62\n00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,804\nthose peak times come around, so\n\n63\n00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:26,290\nthat's when it's things like\nAmazon Web Services comes in real handy.\n\n64\n00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,050\n>> Yeah and even beyond just the servers.\n\n65\n00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,711\nWhen you build your own data center,\nyou've gotta have UPSs, battery backups.\n\n66\n00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,483\nMaybe even generators in case\nyour building loses power,\n\n67\n00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,130\nredundant network connections.\n\n68\n00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,038\nYou might only have one\ninternet service provider,\n\n69\n00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:43,950\nyou really need two or maybe more to\nmake sure that you get redundancy.\n\n70\n00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,951\nIf one Internet link goes down,\nyou got another one.\n\n71\n00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:49,512\nYou need bandwidth and\nthat bandwidth might be variable too.\n\n72\n00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,211\nAll these different things that\nyou need that add to a cost.\n\n73\n00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,470\nWell, Amazon already has all that stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,370\nThey've already got it,\nbecause they need it.\n\n75\n00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,670\nThey've got redundant power connections\ncoming from multiple power companies.\n\n76\n00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,831\nThey've got not just one or two, but like\nfive different ISPs that are feeding each\n\n77\n00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,110\nof their data centers and\nwe can just piggyback right off of that.\n\n78\n00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,450\nThat's the real benefit of using AWS\nis moving our resources at the bare\n\n79\n00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,442\ninfrastructure and taking advantage of\nthings that either we couldn't afford or\n\n80\n00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,790\nthat we could afford, but\nwe don't want to maintain.\n\n81\n00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,250\nAnd we want somebody else to maintain that\nfor us and that's exactly what AWS does.\n\n82\n00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,569\n>> Yeah, now one of the biggest benefits\nI've seen from them is the fact that they\n\n83\n00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,890\nhave these regions and zones.\n\n84\n00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,951\nI don't have to have just one\nspot where I have my data.\n\n85\n00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:33,372\nI can say well, you know what?\n\n86\n00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,031\nThe East Coast might get hit by\na hurricane, we live in Florida.\n\n87\n00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,671\nA very good possibility, something\ncould happen and my data could be lost.\n\n88\n00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:42,502\nWell, if I use multiple zones\nsomewhere geographically,\n\n89\n00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,551\ncompletely different from where I'm at.\n\n90\n00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,570\nThat's gonna give that\navailability a whole lot better.\n\n91\n00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,730\n>> Yeah,\nlet's talk about those terms a little bit.\n\n92\n00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,664\nSo when you start working with Amazon Web\nServices, you're gonna see regions and\n\n93\n00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,032\navailability zones.\n\n94\n00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,911\nThose two terms or\npeople usually just call them zones.\n\n95\n00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:01,231\nSo regions and zones what does that mean?\n\n96\n00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:05,250\nWell, a region is referring\nto a geographic region.\n\n97\n00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,265\nAmazon tries to have data centers in\nall the major areas in the world,\n\n98\n00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,900\nwhere we have high degrees of traffic.\n\n99\n00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,760\nSo they show them all on their web page.\n\n100\n00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,201\nI've got that,\nlet's take a look at this page.\n\n101\n00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,329\nThis is the global infrastructure for\nAmazon Web Services and\n\n102\n00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,961\nthey divide it up by continent.\n\n103\n00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,847\nSo here's the North American continent and\n\n104\n00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:26,840\neach of these yellow circles that are on\nhere, which they are kind of small.\n\n105\n00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,427\nThere we go.\nEach of the yellow circles\n\n106\n00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,701\nrepresent the data center.\n\n107\n00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,861\nSo here in North America,\nwe actually have four data centers.\n\n108\n00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,162\nOne over here in Virginia,\none in California,\n\n109\n00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,721\none up in Oregon and\none in Washington, I believe.\n\n110\n00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,481\nSo you've got these four data,\nwell, I don't have to guess.\n\n111\n00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,353\nThey actually got them written right here.\n\n112\n00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:49,735\n[LAUGH] Virginia, North Carolina,\nOregon and oh, the Government Cloud one,\n\n113\n00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,578\nwhich is also kind of tucked\naway up there in Northwest.\n\n114\n00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:54,141\nSo those are the four\nthat are here in the US.\n\n115\n00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:58,641\nIn other continents,\nthey have more data centers.\n\n116\n00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:02,816\nAnd so if I scroll down here and get past\nthrough a little advertisement blurbs,\n\n117\n00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:07,304\nhere's South America, where they've got\njust one data center right down there in,\n\n118\n00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,761\nI believe it's San Paolo.\n\n119\n00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:11,979\nAnd if we take a look at other continents,\nlike here's Europe,\n\n120\n00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,241\nMiddle East and Africa.\n\n121\n00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:18,440\nThey've got data centers that are [LAUGH]\nas I jump around my continents.\n\n122\n00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,500\nThere we go.\nIn England and in, where is that?\n\n123\n00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,861\nFrance maybe or?\n\n124\n00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:26,761\n>> Spain?\n>> Yeah, something.\n\n125\n00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,341\nSo you've got these data centers that\nare spread out and then in Asia.\n\n126\n00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:36,080\nSo for the Asia Pacific region, we've\ngot Australia, Singapore, China, Japan.\n\n127\n00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,050\nSo these data centers that are out there.\n\n128\n00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,860\nNow when you spin up a server in AWS,\nyou can pick any one of those regions.\n\n129\n00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,790\nSo using Daniel's example,\nwe're in Florida,\n\n130\n00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,821\nwe're on the East Coast of the US.\n\n131\n00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,394\nSo when you take a look at\nthat North American layout, so\n\n132\n00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:54,761\nif I go backup here to North America.\n\n133\n00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:58,270\nWell, they have a data center\nthat's there in Virginia and\n\n134\n00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,961\nI might want to use that one.\n\n135\n00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,890\nVirginia, that's not too far away.\n\n136\n00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,890\nBut if a hurricane hits Florida,\nit could hit Virginia also.\n\n137\n00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,991\nSo if a hurricane hits Florida,\nit might hit Virginia also.\n\n138\n00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,350\nSo when I go to deploy servers,\nI might put some in Virginia,\n\n139\n00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,291\ncuz they're close by.\n\n140\n00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,437\nMaybe I get better\nperformance out of that, but\n\n141\n00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,592\nI might choose to put on\nover in California too.\n\n142\n00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,919\nSo, I've spread them out\nacross those data centers or\n\n143\n00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,611\nif I've got a lot of customers\nthat are in Europe or Australia.\n\n144\n00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,145\nI might want to put some of my\nservers in those regions to get them\n\n145\n00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:30,151\ncloser to my customer geolocating them.\n\n146\n00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,571\nI don't have to go and\nbuild a data center there.\n\n147\n00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:35,435\nIf all of a sudden I have a lot\nof new customers in Australia,\n\n148\n00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:38,951\nI don't want to build a data center\nin Australia, it's a long way away.\n\n149\n00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,751\nI don't even, I've never been there.\n\n150\n00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,451\nBut I don't have to,\ncuz I can just use Amazon's Web Services.\n\n151\n00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,851\nI can just throw services out there,\nand now, they're close to the customer.\n\n152\n00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,812\nThat's a big benefit.\n\n153\n00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:55,412\nNow, each of these data centers\nhas a little bit more to it.\n\n154\n00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:58,696\nNotice how we've got these yellow circles\nand then there's these blue circles also.\n\n155\n00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:03,342\nRight, those are called edge locations,\nand when you have a data center,\n\n156\n00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:08,092\nthat's a big investment for Amazon to\nmake one of these giant data centers.\n\n157\n00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:10,983\nWhat if you're in a city that's not\nbig enough to have a data center but\n\n158\n00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,560\nyou still have a lot of\ncustomer activity there.\n\n159\n00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,040\nWell, what Amazon does is they\nbuild these edge locations.\n\n160\n00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,930\nAnd what it means is there's direct fiber\nconnections between these locations and\n\n161\n00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,280\none of their data centers.\n\n162\n00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,870\nSo if you're in that area, you can hit\nthat edge and it will jump you right over\n\n163\n00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,230\nto one of the data centers like a fast\ntrack speed lane to get to a data center.\n\n164\n00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,990\nSo sure you don't have a region defined\nright there like this one in Texas.\n\n165\n00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,730\nYou don't have one right there in Texas.\n\n166\n00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,800\nThere's a ton of tech companies there.\n\n167\n00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,550\nThey can hit that edge location, and\nthey'll jump on right over to that\n\n168\n00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,580\nCalifornia location, and\nit's as if the data center were nearby.\n\n169\n00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,400\nSo really kind of cuts that path and\n\n170\n00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,210\nthat's what you'll see in some of the\nvarious continents where there's a lot of\n\n171\n00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,260\nedge locations to get you to\na smaller amount of data centers.\n\n172\n00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,930\n>> Yeah, what's interesting about what\nyou're saying about your customers,\n\n173\n00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,200\nyou never know where your product or\n\n174\n00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,200\nyour website might start getting\na lot of popularity, and I've never\n\n175\n00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,400\nbeen Australia either, and I'm sure that\nit would cost me quite a bit of money to\n\n176\n00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,240\nactually have to set up a data center\nthere for my own website if I wanted\n\n177\n00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240\nto increase that traffic connectivity\nwhen I can just go, hey Amazon,\n\n178\n00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,225\nwhy don't you throw another server on\nthere for me, on the barbie as it were.\n\n179\n00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,878\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n180\n00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:23,770\nnow those are regions, right?\n\n181\n00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,490\nAnd regions are effectively data centers,\nright?\n\n182\n00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,990\nAnd so just looking at North America here\nwe've got the US East region, right,\n\n183\n00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,412\nthat's in northern Virginia.\n\n184\n00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:35,130\nWe have the US West Region in California,\nthe other US West region,\n\n185\n00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,540\nwhich is in Oregon.\n\n186\n00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,980\nSo, few different choices there.\n\n187\n00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,580\nInside of each region, you then\nhave availability zones, or zones.\n\n188\n00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,620\nNotice how in the US East region,\nthere are five availability zones.\n\n189\n00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,148\nNow, what's an availability zone?\n\n190\n00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:56,040\nWell, a zone is actually a data center,\nand so what they're saying here is that in\n\n191\n00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,080\nnorthern Virginia there's\nactually five data centers.\n\n192\n00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,070\nFive completely independent data\ncenters that have separate power,\n\n193\n00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,850\nseparate networks,\nseparate infrastructure, so\n\n194\n00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,050\nthat if an entire data center fails, well,\nthere's four more of the things, right?\n\n195\n00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,940\nThen they've got a little asterisk here.\n\n196\n00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,883\nSome of them are full.\n\n197\n00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:17,843\nSo if you're a new customer in northern\nVirginia, there's actually only three that\n\n198\n00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,713\nare available for you to use right\nnow cuz the others are full.\n\n199\n00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,003\nSo you don't always have access\nto all five of them, but\n\n200\n00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:25,580\nthere are technically five\nin Northern Virginia.\n\n201\n00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,180\nIn the US West Region, California,\nthere's only three and\n\n202\n00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,510\nyou'll see some of these other ones.\n\n203\n00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,550\nIn Oregon there's three,\n\n204\n00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,200\nand as we jump into these other\ncountries you get that same type thing.\n\n205\n00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,330\nSo down here in Sao Paulo, Brazil we\nactually have three zones that are two,\n\n206\n00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,420\nthree data centers that are all\nright there in Sao Paulo.\n\n207\n00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,470\nSo that gives us even more flexibility and\nthey have a nice little diagram.\n\n208\n00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,440\nLet me find this diagram.\n\n209\n00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,250\nHere we go, where they show\na region divided into zones.\n\n210\n00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,600\nNow those data centers, they might\nactually be in the same building.\n\n211\n00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160\nThey might be in separate building\nright next to each other, but\n\n212\n00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,250\nthey've got direct\nconnections between them and\n\n213\n00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,340\nthat's important because if I'm\ndeploying servers in one zone and\n\n214\n00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,400\nI'm replicating them to another zone,\nI want as fast as possible communications.\n\n215\n00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,160\nAnd Amazon, depending on the stereo, most\nof the time they don't actually bill for\n\n216\n00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,990\nthat bandwidth between the zones, so\nyou can replicate between them and\n\n217\n00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,800\nget full independence between those data\ncenters without having to incur the cost\n\n218\n00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,260\nof building yet\nanother data center on your own time.\n\n219\n00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,590\nSo definitely a big benefit there.\n\n220\n00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:32,010\nSo when we go to deploy our services\nin AWS these are the choices we make.\n\n221\n00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,630\nWe choose our region and\nwe choose our availability zone.\n\n222\n00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,750\nAnd if you're doing more than one of\na server or whatever your resource is,\n\n223\n00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,130\nmaybe it's a database, you'll pick\nfrom multiple availability zones.\n\n224\n00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,600\nAll right, now these data centers,\n\n225\n00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,245\nobviously Amazon doesn't let you go and\ntake a tour.\n\n226\n00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're very secure data centers.\n\n227\n00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,550\nOnly authorized personnel\nis allowed to go in.\n\n228\n00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,950\nBut a few years back,\nAmazon did a technology open house, and\n\n229\n00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,610\none of their engineers put\nout a little presentation.\n\n230\n00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,310\nI've got it right here.\n\n231\n00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,670\nI wanna show this to you guys,\n\n232\n00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,380\ncuz it shows some pictures that we\nwouldn't normally have access to, right?\n\n233\n00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,990\nHe's an engineer that works for\nAmazon, he's allowed to do these.\n\n234\n00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,910\nSo, what he did, is he took pictures\nof what's going on inside of these\n\n235\n00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,760\ndata centers to display, and\n\n236\n00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,200\nyou can you can download this presentation\nright off Amazon's website if you want.\n\n237\n00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,800\nBut the cool part that we can find is\nthat Amazon does these modular designs,\n\n238\n00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,910\nthis guy right here.\n\n239\n00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,880\nWhen they build out a data center, they've\nalready got a design that they follow,\n\n240\n00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,350\nhow they want their servers set up,\nhow they want their cooling set up,\n\n241\n00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,538\ntheir redundant power, and they build all\nof that into these modular containers.\n\n242\n00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,210\nAnd so if they decide today like hey,\n\n243\n00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,480\nwe're going to build a new data\ncenter in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n244\n00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880\nWell, they don't have to go and\nbuild this from scratch.\n\n245\n00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,450\nThey just take these containers, they drop\nin there, and now they got a data center.\n\n246\n00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,350\nThey run power,\nthey run a network to it, and\n\n247\n00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,920\nthere's hundreds of thousands of servers\nthat are inside of these up and running.\n\n248\n00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,220\nThere's their new data center.\n\n249\n00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,940\nSo, they can quickly expand\ntheir capacity if they need to.\n\n250\n00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,130\nAnd they call it the Amazon Perdix,\nyou know,\n\n251\n00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,080\nmodular data center, and\nthis is just one right here.\n\n252\n00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,140\nThey might deploy several of these right\nnext to each other to increase that.\n\n253\n00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,130\nAnd this whole container is independent so\nthat would be like an availability zone,\n\n254\n00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,730\nand if there was another container\nnext to it, it's fully independent,\n\n255\n00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,930\nthat's another availability zone,\nand that's how they expand that out.\n\n256\n00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,220\nNow the servers themselves,\nthese are big data centers and so\n\n257\n00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,700\nyou can kind of see here all these\ndifferent racks deployed on sub floor.\n\n258\n00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,660\nThis one is probably not in\none of those containers, but\n\n259\n00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,900\nthe containers are built\nthe same way on the inside.\n\n260\n00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,510\nYou get tons and\ntons of servers arranged in\n\n261\n00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,170\na way that really optimizes space,\noptimizes cooling,\n\n262\n00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,930\nand gives us easy administration, so\nthis is what Amazon is doing for you.\n\n263\n00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,720\nYou don't have to build\nall this infrastructure.\n\n264\n00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,370\nThey do it for you.\n\n265\n00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,730\nNow what can we do on that infrastructure?\n\n266\n00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,131\nThis is something that's important.\n\n267\n00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:55,800\nAmazon Web Services is made up\nof tons of different services.\n\n268\n00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,370\nIt's easy for us to get in this rut where\nwe think of it as just virtual servers.\n\n269\n00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,050\nI need to bring up virtual servers.\n\n270\n00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,810\nWell, you can do that, and\nthat's called EC2, right?\n\n271\n00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,020\nRight, the Elastic Compute Cloud,\nbut it does so much more.\n\n272\n00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,960\nWhen I log into the AWS console,\n\n273\n00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,260\nI see all the different services available\nto me, and EC2 is just one part of it.\n\n274\n00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,810\nIt's a very popular part,\nbut it's just one part.\n\n275\n00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,610\nDo I want to do hosted databases?\n\n276\n00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,140\nGreat, I've got several choices.\n\n277\n00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,750\nI can do relational databases,\ndynamos, elastic cash red shift.\n\n278\n00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,730\nI have various products\nto pick from there.\n\n279\n00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,210\nDo I wanna do hosted storage?\n\n280\n00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:32,270\nGreat I've got S3, Glacier, Cloud Front,\nother technologies, I can do that.\n\n281\n00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,130\nDo I want to do authentication?\n\n282\n00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,200\nI wanna do authentication,\nI've got their directory services and\n\n283\n00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,460\nIAM, they provide that functionality.\n\n284\n00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,410\nApplication services for hosted apps.\n\n285\n00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,520\nMaybe I don't want to worry\nabout the operating system and\n\n286\n00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,220\nthe server I just wanna put\nmy applications up there.\n\n287\n00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,390\nWell, I can do that.\n\n288\n00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,730\nWe've got different things.\n\n289\n00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,930\nDo I wanna stream video?\n\n290\n00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,600\nStream video across the Internet?\n\n291\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,378\nYou've got Cloud Front for distributing\ndata and you've got Elastic Transcoder for\n\n292\n00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,020\nconverting that video.\n\n293\n00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,990\nAmazon has a ton of different services.\n\n294\n00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,090\nIt's not just virtual servers, right?\n\n295\n00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,840\nAnd that's an important thing\nto wrap your head around,\n\n296\n00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,640\nbecause each of these gives you more and\nmore power, and it's all distributed.\n\n297\n00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,390\nFor example, maybe I need a DNS server.\n\n298\n00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,380\nWell, do I really need the server?\n\n299\n00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,941\nIt's DNS.\n\n300\n00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,982\nOther people are probably doing it,\nand doing it better.\n\n301\n00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,700\nWell, Amazon has DNS, right?\n\n302\n00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,740\nThey've got tons of domains.\n\n303\n00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,210\nAnd if you look in here you'll\nfind Route 53, hosted DNS service.\n\n304\n00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,040\nI don't care what hardware it runs on.\n\n305\n00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,690\nI don't care what operating\nsystem it runs on.\n\n306\n00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,570\nI just need my DNS zones to be handled and\n\n307\n00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,790\nprovided out to the Internet,\nI can jump right in here and do it.\n\n308\n00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,270\nAnd they give you fully managed services,\nso\n\n309\n00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,910\nwe don't have to worry about that, right?\n\n310\n00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,480\nThat's where AWS really shines,\ntaking away all the fret that we have,\n\n311\n00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,640\nthe worry over having to maintain and\nmanage this service.\n\n312\n00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,800\nWe just put our data in there, and\nthey make it scalable and redundant.\n\n313\n00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,641\nScalability is another big\npart of Amazon Web Services.\n\n314\n00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:57,243\nIf you're an Internet startup,\nMaybe you have two or three employees, and\n\n315\n00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,831\nyou're creating a new product.\n\n316\n00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,110\nYou probably only need a few servers.\n\n317\n00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,030\nBut then, if the tech news agencies find\nout about your product, they announce it\n\n318\n00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,160\nto the world like, these guys are working\non something great, and it goes viral.\n\n319\n00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,700\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n320\n00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,740\novernight you go from having 100\ncustomers to 100 million customers.\n\n321\n00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,580\nYou need your servers to\nbe able to handle that.\n\n322\n00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,190\nWell, AWS is scalable.\n\n323\n00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,690\nYou just go in, and\nyou dial up your numbers.\n\n324\n00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,560\nYou say, give me more CPU, give me more\nnetwork bandwidth, give me more storage.\n\n325\n00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720\nThey dial all that up, and it's done.\n\n326\n00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,760\nThat allows you to be that\novernight success, and\n\n327\n00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,300\nthat's really what we all hope for\nif you're starting a company.\n\n328\n00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,740\nSome of the other things to\nthink about with AWS, billing.\n\n329\n00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,660\nWhen you buy your own server,\nyou pay a flat fee for that server, and\n\n330\n00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,310\nyou buy 100% of it, right?\n\n331\n00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,800\nWhether you're using it or not,\nyou've already paid for it.\n\n332\n00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,180\nAnd if you plug it in,\nyou're paying for power,\n\n333\n00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,260\nyou're paying for maintenance,\nyou got a keep it under warranty,\n\n334\n00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,940\nyou do all those different things\nthat keep that server up and running.\n\n335\n00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,220\nWith Amazon, if you don't use the server,\nsomebody else will.\n\n336\n00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,710\nThe servers are shared, right?\n\n337\n00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,940\nAll the Amazon customers are grabbing\nresources out of those servers,\n\n338\n00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,930\nand when they give them back,\nanother customer can take them.\n\n339\n00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,060\nSo, with Amazon, the billing is all\ndone on a pay for what you use basis,\n\n340\n00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,810\nand that's really cool, because servers\ncan become far less expensive for\n\n341\n00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,780\nus, cuz we're only paying for\nwhat we actually use.\n\n342\n00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,180\nSame thing with storage and bandwidth.\n\n343\n00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,600\nBut be aware, when you sign up for Amazon\nservices, that you do have to understand\n\n344\n00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,850\nhow it bills because the pricing can\nbe a little bit confusing sometimes.\n\n345\n00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,600\nLet's take EC2 as an example, right?\n\n346\n00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,780\nSo with Amazon EC2, I can come in here and\nI can start to create virtual servers,\n\n347\n00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,950\nI can host them,\nprovide them out to the Internet, and\n\n348\n00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,570\npeople can gain access to my servers,\nand it's all right there.\n\n349\n00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,210\nWell, how much money am I gonna get\nbilled at the end of the month for that?\n\n350\n00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,700\nAmazon is very, very plain and\nopen about how their pricing works.\n\n351\n00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,950\nOn each service, you'll see a link\nover here to the pricing, or\n\n352\n00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,970\nyou can just go straight\nto it on their website.\n\n353\n00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,800\nBut their pricing is laid out\nin very clear terms, right?\n\n354\n00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,750\nSo a lot of their services\nhave a free usage tier,\n\n355\n00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,560\nwhich means you can fire up that service,\nand they won't charge you a dime.\n\n356\n00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,420\nIt's for learning, right?\n\n357\n00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,430\nIf you wanna learn\nthe service you can do that.\n\n358\n00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,990\nAnd so it's telling me here,\nI can have 750 hours of an EC2\n\n359\n00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,580\ninstance running Linux, and\nit's not gonna cost me a dime.\n\n360\n00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,700\nWell, 750 hours,\nit's actually 750 hours per month, and\n\n361\n00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,320\nthat works out to basically\nrunning 31 days a month.\n\n362\n00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,030\nSo I can run the server for\nan entire year and not pay them a dime.\n\n363\n00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,350\nIt's a very small server, doesn't have\na lot of resources, enough to learn with.\n\n364\n00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,040\nBut that's a free level.\n\n365\n00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,940\nBut then after that, we've got to pay.\n\n366\n00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,450\nRight?\n\n367\n00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,330\nAnd the way the payments work\nis based on what you use.\n\n368\n00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,040\nAnd so if we look at some of\nthese servers, right, and\n\n369\n00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,230\nI don't wanna focus on the different\ntypes of servers here.\n\n370\n00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,570\nBut I wanna focus on this side over here.\n\n371\n00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,270\nThey're billing me per hour.\n\n372\n00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,390\nIf I spin up one of these servers,\nthey're gonna bill me,\n\n373\n00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,460\nlike this particular server,\npoint .013 cents per hour.\n\n374\n00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,110\nSo, for every hour I run that server,\nI'm paying.\n\n375\n00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,845\n>> Just over a penny.\n\n376\n00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:03,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, just over a penny.\n\n377\n00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,330\nAnd that's kind of a low end server.\n\n378\n00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,140\nIf I bump it up to something\nwith like a lot more memory,\n\n379\n00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,690\nsomething with 15 gigs of memory,\nnow I'm paying 28 cents per hour.\n\n380\n00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,210\nIf I use it three hours a week,\n\n381\n00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,590\nthen I'm only paying 80 cents that week or\nwhatever.\n\n382\n00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,110\nYeah, it's decent math.\n\n383\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,990\nSo, we'll run with that.\n\n384\n00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,560\n90 cents a week, whatever.\n\n385\n00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,720\nBut if I run it 24 hours a day,\n7 days a week, I'm gonna pay more,\n\n386\n00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,620\ncuz I use the server the whole time.\n\n387\n00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,510\nBut if you're in an organization where\nyou just need resources sometimes,\n\n388\n00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,700\nthis works out a lot better.\n\n389\n00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,360\nMany you're a university or\na science laboratory, right?\n\n390\n00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,320\nMaybe you're gonna\nsequence the human genome.\n\n391\n00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,110\nAnd you know that if you go out and buy\nten servers, you've got ten servers, and\n\n392\n00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,170\nthey can sequence that\ngenome over six months.\n\n393\n00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,300\nBut if you had 100 servers,\nyou could do it in one month.\n\n394\n00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,210\nIf you had 1,000 servers you,\ncould do it in one week.\n\n395\n00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,110\nIf you had 2,000 servers,\nyou could do it in one day.\n\n396\n00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,960\nBut if you go out and buy 2,000 servers,\nyou run it for that one day,\n\n397\n00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,130\nyou sequence the genome,\nwhat do you do with the servers tomorrow?\n\n398\n00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,790\n>> eBay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,889\n>> You sell them, and\n\n400\n00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,210\nyou take a huge loss.\n\n401\n00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,770\nRight, because you can't get\nthe same retail price out of them.\n\n402\n00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,360\nBut with Amazon,\nthey say you know what you?\n\n403\n00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,730\nGive me 2,000 servers for tomorrow.\n\n404\n00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,850\nAnd then, when I'm done,\nI turn them all off and that's it.\n\n405\n00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,420\nI don't have to worry about\nre-selling hardware or whatever.\n\n406\n00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,960\nAnd I just pay for what I used.\n\n407\n00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,150\nAnd if it's one hundred\nservers over six months.\n\n408\n00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,820\nOr a thousand servers over two days.\n\n409\n00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,100\nIt works out the same price,\nand I get my stuff faster.\n\n410\n00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,630\nRight?\n\n411\n00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,290\nSo, that's another big advantage of this.\n\n412\n00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,880\nWe pay for what we use.\n\n413\n00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,260\nNow, if you know you're gonna\nbe using it for an entire year,\n\n414\n00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,290\nyou can actually do things where you\nhave what's called a reserved instance.\n\n415\n00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,470\nAnd, where's the pricing for that?\n\n416\n00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,730\nWell here, let's make sure we\ndo apples to apples, right?\n\n417\n00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,200\nI'm going to take this m3.xlarge,\nthat's 28 cents per hour.\n\n418\n00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,130\nIf I just do it on an on-demand basis,\nright?\n\n419\n00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,260\nIf we do a reserved instance, let's go\ndown here and find our reserve instances.\n\n420\n00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,260\nSo these are reserve instances where\nI know I'm gonna be using them for\n\n421\n00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,250\na long term.\n\n422\n00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,930\nRight?\n\n423\n00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,820\nWhen I take one of these guys,\nand I'll find the M3.\n\n424\n00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,795\nIt was m3.xlarge I was looking at, right?\n\n425\n00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:13,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n426\n00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,830\n>> And I look at one of these.\n\n427\n00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,200\nIf I do like, no upfront payment, right,\n\n428\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,820\nI just do it, then the effective\nrate is $0.20 an hour, right?\n\n429\n00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,910\nI pay less, $0.08 an hour less.\n\n430\n00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,200\nI've saved some money.\n\n431\n00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,460\nBut I know I'm gonna use it all year long.\n\n432\n00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,520\nYou basically sign like a one\nyear contract when you do that.\n\n433\n00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,550\nBut you can also pay up front,\nlike a down payment, and\n\n434\n00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,630\nit lowers that cost, and it gets even\nlower, and you really start to save money.\n\n435\n00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,710\nAnd so, if I know I'm gonna use it for\n\n436\n00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,140\na whole year, I can save 39%,\nif I go ahead and do the year reservation.\n\n437\n00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,500\nBut I have to know I'm gonna\nuse that server all year.\n\n438\n00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,100\nIf I'm not gonna use it all year,\nan on-demand might be even better.\n\n439\n00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,620\nIf I need a thousand servers just for\ntomorrow,\n\n440\n00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,840\nthen I just need to do that on demand.\n\n441\n00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,850\nIf I try and do one year reservations on\nthe stuff, it's gonna be kind of a waste.\n\n442\n00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,850\nBut you can really kind of cut that price\ndown a good bit by reserving the instance.\n\n443\n00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,530\nAnd that's how most of\nthe Amazon services work.\n\n444\n00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,250\nYou pay for the resource that you're\nusing, but you also pay for bandwidth.\n\n445\n00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,051\nAnd I'm sure that's here\non this page somewhere.\n\n446\n00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,073\nLet me just search and find it,\ncuz that'll be faster.\n\n447\n00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:17,992\nYou know,\nactually they're not showing it here.\n\n448\n00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:20,073\nBut data consumption, you pay for\n\n449\n00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,210\na certain amount of bandwidth on each one,\nand.\n\n450\n00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,660\nHere we go, Data Transfer.\n\n451\n00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,850\nWith data transfer, you pay for\ndata in and data out.\n\n452\n00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,240\nData in is data going to the service,\nand data out is data coming out of it.\n\n453\n00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,430\nYou know, downloads.\n\n454\n00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,300\nThe uploads are normally free.\n\n455\n00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,940\nSo see here this data transfer into EC2.\n\n456\n00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,710\nand it's all listed at like\nzero dollars per gigabyte.\n\n457\n00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,720\nThey don't charge you putting data in EC2\nor charge you for data putting into S3 or\n\n458\n00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,150\nRDS or whatever.\n\n459\n00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,000\nThey don't charge you for that.\n\n460\n00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,120\nIt's when you get the data back out.\n\n461\n00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,380\nAnd when you get the data back out,\nwe'll see here, data transfer out.\n\n462\n00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,300\nTo a certain level it's free,\nbut then they start charging, and\n\n463\n00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,000\nhere it looks like we've got\nabout one cent per gigabyte,\n\n464\n00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,350\ntwo cents per gigabyte in other regions.\n\n465\n00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,000\nSo, not a huge amount of money there,\nright?\n\n466\n00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,060\nNow, if you're pushing terabytes of\ndata it can add up, but this is really,\n\n467\n00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,480\nreally inexpensive.\n\n468\n00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,310\nAnd when we talk about S3 and\nother services like that,\n\n469\n00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,290\neach one of them,\nthey have their own pricing structure.\n\n470\n00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,790\nAnd so you go in, and\nyou pull up the pricing for\n\n471\n00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,900\neach of those to be able to find\nthe appropriate cost and all of that.\n\n472\n00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,630\nSo definitely something that\nyou wanna pay attention to.\n\n473\n00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,570\nYou are paying for what you use.\n\n474\n00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,330\nAnd if you're using it and that usually\nmeans like if you're a business,\n\n475\n00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,090\nthat you're making money on it,\nand so it kind of pays for itself.\n\n476\n00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,455\nBut if you're a non-profit or whatever it\ncan be a little difficult to estimate what\n\n477\n00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:40,971\nyour costs are gonna be because\nit's based on your end users usage.\n\n478\n00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,293\nAll right, but it is all very clear.\n\n479\n00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:48,970\nWhen you go to Amazon's website, all the\npricing is spelled out in certain terms.\n\n480\n00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,180\nThey tell you exactly\nwhat you're gonna pay.\n\n481\n00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,590\nSo like here with S3, the first terabyte\nthat I send out is gonna cost me\n\n482\n00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,600\nthree cents per gigabyte, but\nas I start pushing more and more and more,\n\n483\n00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,340\nit gets cheaper and cheaper, until we get\ndown to like 2.75 cents per gigabyte.\n\n484\n00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,330\nIt starts to get less expensive, and\n\n485\n00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,520\nother types of storage might\nbe less expensive, too.\n\n486\n00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,550\nYou basically pick and\nchoose based on that.\n\n487\n00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,630\nIt's pretty neat stuff.\n\n488\n00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,600\n>> Yeah, it sounds like you're\nreally compounding your savings to\n\n489\n00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,160\nbe honest with you.\n\n490\n00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,790\nI'm not trying to pitch Amazon.\n\n491\n00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,920\nI don't work for them.\n\n492\n00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,000\nBut the fact that you're\nreducing your waste, right?\n\n493\n00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,190\nYou're not having to have all these\nextra services sitting around and only\n\n494\n00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,180\nuse them when you need them, and plus the\ninfrastructure to support that business.\n\n495\n00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,960\nAnd then also it's really cheap,\nit's not that expensive.\n\n496\n00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,265\nI mean, those prices right there,\nI could live with that.\n\n497\n00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:39,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> So that's kind of an overview of AWS.\n\n498\n00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,790\nWhat they're providing to you,\nhow they can benefit you,\n\n499\n00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,510\nand what we're gonna do is over\nthe next series of episodes\n\n500\n00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,370\nwe're gonna start seeing each\nof these individual services.\n\n501\n00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,800\nSo how do I use EC2.\n\n502\n00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,670\nHow do I use S3.\n\n503\n00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,130\nHow do I use RDS?\n\n504\n00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,550\nAnd we'll get a chance to\nsee each of those in play.\n\n505\n00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,060\nBut we wanted to do an introduction to\nthis just so you can kind of understand\n\n506\n00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,520\nwhat AWS was in the first place,\nand why you'd want to use them.\n\n507\n00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,900\nAnd they're not the only player\nthat's out there in this field.\n\n508\n00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,100\nThey're one of the first, right?\n\n509\n00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,300\nThey are the biggest.\n\n510\n00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,360\nBut there's Microsoft with Azure,\nthere's Rackspace, there's MediaTemple,\n\n511\n00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,000\nthere's all sorts of other vendors out\nthere that do the same basic thing.\n\n512\n00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720\nAnd those services work fairly similar.\n\n513\n00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,350\nThe difference is gonna be how\nmany data centers they have,\n\n514\n00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,850\nhow big those data centers are, and\nthe resources that are available.\n\n515\n00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,720\n>> Awesome!\n\n516\n00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,600\nWell, I guess that about wraps it up for\nus today on Amazon.\n\n517\n00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760\nHopefully you guys have\nlearned a lot from this.\n\n518\n00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,510\nI know I sure have.\n\n519\n00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,790\nI've really enjoyed it.\n\n520\n00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,160\nSo that being said it's time\nto sign off for ITProTV.\n\n521\n00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,590\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n522\n00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,110\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n523\n00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,595\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n524\n00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:44,960\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,870\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,390\nHere with me today is Don Pizet.\n\n6\n00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,430\nHow you doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,250\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,080\nI'm excited to jump right back into\nour cloud fundamentals episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,510\nAnd today we're gonna be taking\na look at Amazon Web Services.\n\n10\n00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,245\nAnd in particular, we're gonna look at the\nElastic Compute Cloud, the EC2 service.\n\n11\n00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:36,770\nThe EC2 is just one aspect of the very\nbig Amazon Web Services product.\n\n12\n00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,130\nAnd for somebody who's a SUSE admin, this\nis often what we think of as the cloud or\n\n13\n00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,930\nas AWS,\neven though it's only a small part of it.\n\n14\n00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,810\nEC2 allows us to host\nservers in the cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,550\nWe can bring up these servers\non Amazon's infrastructure\n\n16\n00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,930\ninstead of having to run it our own.\n\n17\n00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,800\nAnd there are a ton of advantages to that.\n\n18\n00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200\nSo it's a really exciting technology,\nit's something I love to talk about.\n\n19\n00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,650\n>> Yeah, this is the really cool feature\nof Amazon's Web Services actually.\n\n20\n00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,250\nSo if you have any kind of\nbackground in virtualization.\n\n21\n00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,490\nI've done with the ESX servers and\nsome Citrix, as well.\n\n22\n00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,290\nVery similar to that.\n\n23\n00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,750\nOther than that,\nit's just all on Amazon's actual website.\n\n24\n00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,870\n>> Yeah, and we get to take\nadvantage of all the benefits there.\n\n25\n00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,360\nThat they take care of the power.\n\n26\n00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,660\nThey take care of the network.\n\n27\n00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,870\nThey take care of redundancy.\n\n28\n00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,760\nWe spring up our operating systems and go.\n\n29\n00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,310\nAnd what makes it really\nnice is how easy it is.\n\n30\n00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,850\nSo, that's what we're gonna\nwalk through right here.\n\n31\n00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,890\nLet's jump on in to our AWS,\nand get a chance to see that.\n\n32\n00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,465\nSo, I'm logged into my AWS console.\n\n33\n00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,180\nAnd when you log in,\nyou see all your different services, and\n\n34\n00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,210\nthey divide them up into categories.\n\n35\n00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,900\nUsually, the first one in the category\nis the most popular service.\n\n36\n00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,690\nAnd under Compute,\nyou got EC2 right there at the top.\n\n37\n00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,700\nThis is the one that we're shooting for.\n\n38\n00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,160\nAnd it lets us create those\nvirtual servers in the cloud.\n\n39\n00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,510\nAnd when you jump in, getting started\nis really not a hard thing to do.\n\n40\n00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,300\nNow do be aware of some of the terminology\nthat we're gonna see in here.\n\n41\n00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,060\nIn E.C. two, they don't call\nvirtual servers, virtual servers.\n\n42\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,150\nThey don't call them virtual machines,\nthey call them instances.\n\n43\n00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,070\nAnd the reason is, you may actually\nhave one particular type of virtual\n\n44\n00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,680\nmachine that you spawned 10,\n100, 1,000 copies of.\n\n45\n00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,670\nAnd so it's one virtual machine\nthat's been cloned 1,000 and\n\n46\n00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,680\nso you have instances of that\nvirtual machine that exist.\n\n47\n00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,330\nSo when we go in here,\nyou'll see a number of running instances,\n\n48\n00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,920\nthat's how many servers you already have.\n\n49\n00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,680\nI've got two, so\n\n50\n00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,768\nI get two running instances, If you don't\nhave any, you get a welcome screen which\n\n51\n00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:29,560\nis this Launch Instance button right\nhere to go ahead and get started.\n\n52\n00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,890\nNow getting started is super simple.\n\n53\n00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,810\nIt walks you through a basic\nwizard where we can pick and\n\n54\n00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,410\nchoose what it is that we want.\n\n55\n00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,690\nOn Amazon's system,\nthey support two primary OSs.\n\n56\n00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,940\nThey support Linux based\noperating systems, and\n\n57\n00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,710\nthey support Microsoft Windows\nbased operating systems.\n\n58\n00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,940\nNow they do support others.\n\n59\n00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,775\nThere are some custom images that you'll\nsee that you can use, things like\n\n60\n00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:54,310\nBSD-based OS's, but for the most part\nyou're gonna see Linux and Windows.\n\n61\n00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,400\nBut provisioning them is really the same,\nregardless of which one your choosing.\n\n62\n00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,060\nSo right here on my quick start, it's\nasking me what operating system I want.\n\n63\n00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,790\nAnd you'll see Amazon Linux AMI.\n\n64\n00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,520\nAMI as in Amazon machine image.\n\n65\n00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,030\nThat means they've created\nan image of this operating system\n\n66\n00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,930\nready to deploy at a moment's notice.\n\n67\n00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,930\nI just have to tell it to do it.\n\n68\n00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,250\nAmazon Linux is actually based on CentOS,\nwhich in turn is based on Red Hat.\n\n69\n00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,780\nIt's an open sourced OS,\n\n70\n00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,080\nand so there's no real licensing\nthat we have to worry about here.\n\n71\n00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,610\nIt's a great way to get\na Linux box deployed.\n\n72\n00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,040\nI really like it, and\nthe main reason I like it is because\n\n73\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,780\nAmazon maintains their\nown update repositories.\n\n74\n00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,060\nSo when you do updates,\nit's super fast, and\n\n75\n00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,090\nAmazon has actually kind of curated\nsome of those updates for you.\n\n76\n00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,320\nSo it's a great one.\n\n77\n00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,340\nThis is typically the go-to image for me.\n\n78\n00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,150\nBut maybe you want some of the closed\nsource technologies found in Red Hat.\n\n79\n00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,920\nYou can do that too.\n\n80\n00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,800\nRight, so\nwe can do Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n81\n00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,540\nYou'll see Suse Linux, Ubuntu.\n\n82\n00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,360\nAnd then right down here we've\ngot Microsoft Windows Server,\n\n83\n00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,250\nright, all ready to go.\n\n84\n00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,770\nAmazon's already made an image,\nwe can deploy them, and\n\n85\n00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,360\nwe don't worry about licensing.\n\n86\n00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440\nThat's kind of the cool part,\n\n87\n00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,290\nis Microsoft Windows is kind of\na little bit closed doors, right?\n\n88\n00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,560\nAnd normally we gotta buy that and\npay for licenses.\n\n89\n00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,340\nBut here if I choose this one,\n\n90\n00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,690\nthe price is rolled into the hourly\nrate that's assigned to that VM.\n\n91\n00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,940\nSo as I'm running that instance, it's\njust factoring in that license for me.\n\n92\n00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,890\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nstart off with a Linux one, though.\n\n93\n00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,910\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nchoose this guy.\n\n94\n00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,730\nNow on this screen, I'm only seeing a\nselection of instances, about 22 of them.\n\n95\n00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,730\nYou'll see this quite a bit,\nWindows Server 2012, 2008.\n\n96\n00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,160\nWe got more Amazon Linux ones.\n\n97\n00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520\nBut there's even more.\n\n98\n00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,420\nThis is just 22 of the most popular ones\nthat Amazon recommends and supports.\n\n99\n00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,116\nBut over here you'll see things like\nthe AWS marketplace and community AMIs.\n\n100\n00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,360\nThese are where you can find,\nlike with the market place,\n\n101\n00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,020\nyou can find where private companies have\nbuilt machine appliances or instances that\n\n102\n00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,260\nyou can launch that already have their\nsoftware installed and configured.\n\n103\n00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,580\nAnd there's community ones where other\npeople in the community have done it.\n\n104\n00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,430\nSo if you're gonna be deploying\nsomething like a WordPress server,\n\n105\n00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,530\nwell I could deploy the Amazon Linux AMI.\n\n106\n00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,760\nI could install Apache and MySQL.\n\n107\n00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,080\nI could load WordPress on there,\nget it configured and go.\n\n108\n00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,580\nOr I could just go find a community\nAMI that already had WordPress set up.\n\n109\n00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,160\nAnd now, all I have to do is spawn that\ninstance, login, change the password.\n\n110\n00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,830\nThat's it.\n\n111\n00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,500\n>> Are the community AMIs free or paid\nfor, or is there, like, a jumble of both?\n\n112\n00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,700\n>> Generally, what you see is\nthat the community ones are free.\n\n113\n00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,670\nAnd those are ones that\nare kinda being given out.\n\n114\n00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,550\nAnd the marketplace ones,\nthose are the ones that you pay for.\n\n115\n00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,090\nSo a great example, we use a Barracuda\nspam and virus firewall here.\n\n116\n00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,490\nAnd we actually have the hardware box that\nyou stick in a server rack and you run it.\n\n117\n00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,180\nAnd we have to keep that under\nmaintenance, in case the hardware fails.\n\n118\n00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,660\nWell another option is that Barracuda\nhas in the Amazon Web Services'\n\n119\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,280\nmarketplace where you can go and\nget it as a virtual machine.\n\n120\n00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,790\nNow you don't have to worry\nabout hardware anymore.\n\n121\n00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,720\nYou still have to pay for your virus\nupdates, but you just get it from there.\n\n122\n00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,410\nSo it's a paid virtual machine cuz\nit's got their software on it.\n\n123\n00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,070\nYeah, if you're ever bored,\nbrowse around in here.\n\n124\n00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,410\nI'll kinda jump in.\n\n125\n00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,250\nIf we go to that marketplace,\nyou'll see a ton of stuff in there\n\n126\n00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,140\nfrom open source OSs,\nlike CentOS, to actual products.\n\n127\n00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,480\nWordPress, mongoDB, Ruby and LAMP stacks.\n\n128\n00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,400\nTons and tons of stuff, and if I search,\nlet's see if we can find that Barracuda\n\n129\n00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,382\none, if I can remember\nhow to spell Barracuda.\n\n130\n00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,440\n>> [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> This is gonna be our big challenge,\n\n131\n00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360\nhow to spell Barracuda.\n\n132\n00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560\nSo, there's Barracuda load balancer,\nweb application, here.\n\n133\n00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,500\nSpam firewall.\n\n134\n00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,270\nThat's the one I'm talking about,\nwhere we have hardware that does it.\n\n135\n00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,590\nWe pay a lot of money for that.\n\n136\n00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,620\nBut we can deploy a virtual machine, and\n\n137\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,080\nwhen you look at this you got\nBarracuda spam firewall free trial.\n\n138\n00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,550\nBarracuda spam firewall\nbring your own licence.\n\n139\n00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,650\nWe already have a license, so we can\nmove off of this machine if we wanted.\n\n140\n00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,660\nOr you'll see down here where you\ncan actually just buy the thing.\n\n141\n00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,740\nSo you've got a few\ndifferent options here.\n\n142\n00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,960\nYou deploy it, and some of them will\nbe paid, some of them will be free,\n\n143\n00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880\nsome of them have a license\nfactored into them.\n\n144\n00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960\nSome don't, it just depends\non what you're looking for.\n\n145\n00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,220\nDo be careful with the community AMIs.\n\n146\n00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,460\nBecause you don't necessarily\nknow who made those, and\n\n147\n00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,270\nso you're acting under a certain trust or\n\n148\n00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,960\nsomething you're assuming that person\nset it up securely and safely.\n\n149\n00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,650\nSo if you're using community AMIs, make\nsure that you do a security audit on them\n\n150\n00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,130\nyourself, unless it's one that you\nknow it has been generally accepted.\n\n151\n00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,980\nA lot of the ones that come from\nAmazon those you can trust.\n\n152\n00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,400\nOnes that come from other providers,\n\n153\n00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,930\nyou just have to make sure\nyou trust those providers.\n\n154\n00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,000\nWell I'm gonna go back to my Quick Start,\nand I'll just spin up a Linux AMI.\n\n155\n00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,300\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Select.\n\n156\n00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,320\nNow technically, right when I get to this\nscreen all I have to do is pick the level\n\n157\n00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,610\nof hardware support I want, and then hit\nReview and Launch and I'm done, all right?\n\n158\n00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,645\nSo it's super easy to spin\nup one of these instances.\n\n159\n00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,085\nBut I wanna go through this the hard way.\n\n160\n00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,565\nI wanna go through all\nthe different screens, so\n\n161\n00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:42,685\nI can show you guys\nthe options that we pick.\n\n162\n00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:46,375\nThe only real option that we have\nto provide is our instance type.\n\n163\n00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,495\nAnd this is what determines how many\nvirtual CPUs we're gonna have, and\n\n164\n00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,705\nhow much RAM we get, right?\n\n165\n00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,118\nDepending on how beefy you\nneed your server to be,\n\n166\n00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,596\nyou've got to pick an instance\nthat matches that.\n\n167\n00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,981\nAnd there's two neat benefits to this.\n\n168\n00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:04,894\nOne of the biggest benefits is that I\ndon't have to pick hardware that expect\n\n169\n00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,059\nover what I want.\n\n170\n00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,370\nI can pick exactly what I need.\n\n171\n00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,620\nBecause the second benefit is,\nas I increase the load on my server,\n\n172\n00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,890\nI can come and change this.\n\n173\n00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,050\nI can bump my instance\nup to higher hardware.\n\n174\n00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,000\nSo, maybe today I only\nneed 1 gig of memory.\n\n175\n00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,850\nSo I can go with a micro instance\ncuz I'm in testing, right?\n\n176\n00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,160\nSo I do 1 gig.\n\n177\n00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,450\nI save money,\nI just get the hardware I need.\n\n178\n00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,620\nBut when I'm ready to roll it into\nproduction, I need 5 gigs of memory.\n\n179\n00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,710\nSo I look down here and\n\n180\n00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,640\nI find the next level instance\nthat we do that is m3.large.\n\n181\n00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,410\nAnd, so\nI can increase my instance up to that.\n\n182\n00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,560\nI dynamically upgrade my hardware and\noff I go.\n\n183\n00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,503\nI'm not paying for all that extra hardware\nwhile I don't need it I just pay for\n\n184\n00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:44,178\nit when I do.\n\n185\n00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:48,066\nSo picking this instance type is really\ncentering around how many CPUs you\n\n186\n00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,895\nneed and how much memory you need.\n\n187\n00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,338\nAnd you'll see it kinda laid\nout as they go down here.\n\n188\n00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:56,381\nSome of these instances are tuned to give\nyou tons of memory and not a lot of CPU.\n\n189\n00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,056\nOther ones give you tons of CPU and\nnot a lot of memory.\n\n190\n00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,456\nSome of them give you all of the above.\n\n191\n00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,931\nBut just remember the further\ndown this list you get,\n\n192\n00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,746\nthe more expensive these get, right?\n\n193\n00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:10,350\nThey do charge money per hour and the EC2\npricing is posted right on their Web page.\n\n194\n00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,590\nIt's not normally a lot of money.\n\n195\n00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,690\nThis is really affordable service.\n\n196\n00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,610\nAll right,\nwell I'm just gonna go with a micro for\n\n197\n00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,470\nright now, cuz I'm just in-testing.\n\n198\n00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,000\nAnd so I'll choose that, and\nnotice how it has free tier eligible?\n\n199\n00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,170\nAmazon has a free usage tier, and\n\n200\n00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,970\nthey do this so that viewers like you\ncan learn and try out the system.\n\n201\n00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,010\nSo, if you wanna experiment with\nlaunching a virtual machine, you can and\n\n202\n00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,300\nwon't cost you a dime.\n\n203\n00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,530\nYou can actually launch one micro\ninstance and run it 24 hours a day for\n\n204\n00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,780\nan entire year, and\nthey won't charge you a penny for it.\n\n205\n00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,580\nA great way to get in there and\nlearn the system so\n\n206\n00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,270\nif you want to go through this\nprocess yourself you can, right?\n\n207\n00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,950\nNow, if you start stepping up to\nthe higher end ones, those do cost money.\n\n208\n00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,360\nBut you'll notice that most of them are,\nsome of them are $0.08 an hour,\n\n209\n00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040\nsome are $0.25 an hour.\n\n210\n00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,867\nSo just to learn and\nmess around with these systems.\n\n211\n00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:55,933\nIt doesn't cost much money.\n\n212\n00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:58,751\nYou just shut the systems down\nwhen you don't need them.\n\n213\n00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,933\nAll right, well I'm gonna spin\nup this micro instance and\n\n214\n00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,040\nI'll go and\njust hit my Next button down here.\n\n215\n00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,130\nAnd now it's gonna start to show some of\nthe additional options I can configure.\n\n216\n00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,590\nThis first one,\nhow many instances do I want?\n\n217\n00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,540\nMaybe I'm about to build a Web farm,\nand I need eight servers.\n\n218\n00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,420\nWell, I can spawn up eight\nall the same time, right?\n\n219\n00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,690\nOr, in my case, I'll just do one.\n\n220\n00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,510\nWe can create custom images that already\nhave our software loaded, that already\n\n221\n00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,560\nhave everything configured, and then\nthey said nice, cuz you can really quick\n\n222\n00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,470\nspin up a ten, or a hundred, or\na thousand of them and it's no big deal.\n\n223\n00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,640\nSo, that's a pretty convenient thing.\n\n224\n00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,500\nWe also have the option to do\nwhat's called a Spot Instance.\n\n225\n00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,710\nNow, Spot Instances are a really\ninteresting concept.\n\n226\n00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,310\nNormally when I say I need a virtual\nserver, Daniel, if I came to you and\n\n227\n00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,860\nI said hey, I need a Web server.\n\n228\n00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,447\nI wanna put a website on the Internet.\n\n229\n00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:50,127\nHow much uptime do you think\nthat system would need?\n\n230\n00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,443\n>> A lot, I mean it's supposed\nto be seen by the Internet so\n\n231\n00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:54,937\nit'd be up all the time.\n\n232\n00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,193\n>> Yeah, for most of us, when we bring\na server up like on the Internet,\n\n233\n00:10:58,193 --> 00:10:59,530\nwe want it up all the time.\n\n234\n00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,550\nSo when we create that instance in EC2,\nwe're expecting to use it 24 hours a day,\n\n235\n00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,090\n7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n\n236\n00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,087\nBut what if you don't need that, right?\n\n237\n00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:13,820\nWhat if you work for a science laboratory\nand you're doing something like\n\n238\n00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,940\nsequencing the human genome, and you know\nit's gonna take a ton of computer power.\n\n239\n00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,240\nYou're gonna need thousands of hours of\nCPU time to calculate all this data out.\n\n240\n00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,774\nBut you don't need it tomorrow and\nyou don't need it necessarily 24/7.\n\n241\n00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,397\nWhat you can do is you can\nrequest a Spot Instance.\n\n242\n00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,830\nAnd with a Spot Instance what\nyou do is you tell Amazon, hey,\n\n243\n00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,260\nI need these servers.\n\n244\n00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,360\nBut only give them to me when you\njust have leftover space, right?\n\n245\n00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,972\nAmazon has a ton of hardware.\n\n246\n00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:45,120\nAnd when we spin up our instances, we're\nreserving part of the hardware, right?\n\n247\n00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240\nWe're using it.\n\n248\n00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,270\nWell sometimes it's hardware that\nnobody's reserved, and it sits there and\n\n249\n00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,410\ngoes to waste.\n\n250\n00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,720\nAnd so\nAmazon sells that as a Spot Instance,\n\n251\n00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120\nand they sell it at a cheaper rate.\n\n252\n00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,900\nYou pay a lot less for it.\n\n253\n00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,450\nAnd so I might say,\nI need 1,000 hours of CPU time.\n\n254\n00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,140\nI don't care if that thousand hours\nis today or tomorrow or next week.\n\n255\n00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,480\nOr if it's broken up into little\nchunks over three months.\n\n256\n00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480\nI don't care.\n\n257\n00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,433\nIf you do a Spot Instance,\nyou save a ton of money.\n\n258\n00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,543\nSo if you're just concerned\nabout processor time, and\n\n259\n00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:14,987\nyou don't need the data 24/7, a Spot\nInstance will save you a lot of money.\n\n260\n00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,030\nIt's a really neat technology, right?\n\n261\n00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,359\nYou're basically taking the leftover\nhardware and using them, all right?\n\n262\n00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,686\nBut most of the time we do\nwant it full time, right?\n\n263\n00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:23,555\nWe want it all always available,\n\n264\n00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,976\nand that's why I request\na Spot Instance is not the default.\n\n265\n00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,968\nAll right, after that we've got a few\nother topics that we'll cover in some\n\n266\n00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:30,773\nof our other shows.\n\n267\n00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,617\nBut we pick which network\nwe want it be on.\n\n268\n00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,970\nIf you have a new account\nyou've only got one network.\n\n269\n00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,800\nIt's your virtual private network, and\nthat one is exposed to the Internet so\n\n270\n00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,180\nthat you can access these resources.\n\n271\n00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,700\nI'll just leave it at the default,\nso I'm not gonna change that.\n\n272\n00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,460\nSo a few options there.\n\n273\n00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,130\nAfterwards I've got my IAM role.\n\n274\n00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,790\nBy default you're logged into your AWS\naccount, you're an administrator, so\n\n275\n00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,380\nyou will have access to do whatever\nyou need to this virtual machine.\n\n276\n00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,480\nBut what if you have other employees\nthat log into the Amazon account, right?\n\n277\n00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,550\nYou might have created user accounts for\nthem.\n\n278\n00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,200\nWe can assign an IAM role and\nthat can dictate all sorts of things.\n\n279\n00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,240\nIt can dictate what this\nserver is allowed to do,\n\n280\n00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,080\nwhat it's allowed to\naccess on the network.\n\n281\n00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,470\nAnd it can dictate who is\nallowed to access this server.\n\n282\n00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,710\nYou can put all sorts of\ninformation in these things.\n\n283\n00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,760\nSo we have another\nepisode that covers IAM.\n\n284\n00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,720\nDefinitely check that out.\n\n285\n00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,790\nWe go into it in more depth.\n\n286\n00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,290\nBut these last options?\n\n287\n00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,440\nThese are a little more important,\nall right.\n\n288\n00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,050\nShutdown behavior.\n\n289\n00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,780\nBy default,\n\n290\n00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,280\nwhen you shut a virtual machine down,\nit does what's called stopping.\n\n291\n00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,368\nStopping just means the power's off,\nand it sits there.\n\n292\n00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:34,353\nNow a powered-off virtual machine doesn't\nneed CPU, and it doesn't need RAM.\n\n293\n00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:38,270\nSo when it's shut off, you give that back\nto Amazon, you don't get billed for that.\n\n294\n00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,720\nBut a powered off virtual machine\nstill needs storage, your hard drives.\n\n295\n00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,030\nSo you do still get billed for\nstorage, that's important remember.\n\n296\n00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,240\nBut you're not getting billed for\nresources you're not using.\n\n297\n00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,950\nWith Amazon, you always pay for\nwhat you use,\n\n298\n00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,730\nthat's really the nice part, all right?\n\n299\n00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,330\nBut there are other\noptions like Terminate.\n\n300\n00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,640\nNow Terminate says if I shut\nthis virtual machine down,\n\n301\n00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,880\nas soon as it shuts down, delete it.\n\n302\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,140\nGet rid of it, right?\n\n303\n00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,880\nNow, you might ask yourself why\nthe heck would I wanna do that?\n\n304\n00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,456\nWell it ties into something\ncalled Auto Scaling.\n\n305\n00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:11,220\nAuto Scaling is a really awesome\ntechnology that says I might have\n\n306\n00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,670\na website that, most of the day, I only\nneed one or two servers to power it.\n\n307\n00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,000\nI only have enough utilization,\nenough users hit that site,\n\n308\n00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,940\nI would just need one or two servers.\n\n309\n00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,403\nBut every now and then,\nlike right around 5 PM,\n\n310\n00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,588\nwhen people are getting off work,\nmy website spikes in usage,\n\n311\n00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:28,670\nand also, they need ten servers\nto handle the load, right?\n\n312\n00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,054\nWell you can use Auto Scaling\nto automatically spin up more\n\n313\n00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:34,195\ninstances to cover that peak load and\n\n314\n00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:38,845\nthen when the peak load dies back down\nit can prune those instances off, right?\n\n315\n00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,340\nIt can shut them down.\n\n316\n00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,947\nWell when it shuts them\ndown you don't wanna keep\n\n317\n00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,170\npaying storage on those instances.\n\n318\n00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,100\nYou don't need it.\n\n319\n00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,830\nYou can just have it delete, and that's\nwhat this option is basically saying.\n\n320\n00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,710\nBe careful with that.\n\n321\n00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,600\nTerminate and stop are very different.\n\n322\n00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,230\nStop just powers it off,\nbut it keeps all your data.\n\n323\n00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,377\nTerminate powers it off and\ndeletes the instance.\n\n324\n00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,082\nSo definitely be careful on that.\n\n325\n00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,426\n>> You don't want that one as the default.\n\n326\n00:14:58,426 --> 00:14:59,578\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n327\n00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,880\nenough people have made that mistake\nthat they've got that option right Next,\n\n328\n00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,715\nprotect against accidental termination,\nright?\n\n329\n00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,819\nThis makes it where you have to manually\nturn this protection setting off before\n\n330\n00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:11,130\nyou can terminate the instance.\n\n331\n00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,420\nIf you wanna keep it,\nit's a good thing to set.\n\n332\n00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,445\nAll right, then we've got enable\nCloudWatch detail monitoring.\n\n333\n00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:21,503\nAmazon provides basic diagnostic and\nperformance monitoring of your system.\n\n334\n00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,152\nThey'll show you your CPU utilization and\nnetwork bandwidth for\n\n335\n00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,460\nany of your instances, right?\n\n336\n00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,813\nCuz they have to track that anyway for\nbilling purposes, so\n\n337\n00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,415\nyou get that for free.\n\n338\n00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:33,315\nBut if you want more detailed information,\nif you wanna detail how much\n\n339\n00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:37,290\nRAM utilization your system has and so\non, that's not in the normal reports.\n\n340\n00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,600\nYou can do CloudWatch and\n\n341\n00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,140\nyou can try all sorts of detailed\nstuff like response time.\n\n342\n00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,590\nHow long to take my Web page to generate,\nCloudWatch can tell you, right?\n\n343\n00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,470\nHow many processes are running on\nthe system, CloudWatch can tell you.\n\n344\n00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,152\nSo you can turn that on and\ndo all sorts of neat stuff.\n\n345\n00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,366\nThe CloudWatch has a free\nusage here also so\n\n346\n00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,711\nyou can set up a number\nof monitors at no cost.\n\n347\n00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:59,201\nBut after you have a certain amount of\nmonitors it does actually start to have\n\n348\n00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:02,909\na cost to it but it's really inexpensive\neven with thousands of servers is really\n\n349\n00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:03,690\nnot much money.\n\n350\n00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,290\nThen this last option\nI've got here is tenancy.\n\n351\n00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,430\nWith Amazon the reason they can offer you\ninstances that are at such a low cost\n\n352\n00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,570\nis that your virtual machine is running on\nservers side-by-side with other customers.\n\n353\n00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,170\nThere's other customers\nrunning on that hardware too.\n\n354\n00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,230\nWell, there's pros and cons to that.\n\n355\n00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,570\nAll right,\nthe pro is that we save a lot of money and\n\n356\n00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,650\nAmazon is able to utilize\ntheir hardware to its fullest.\n\n357\n00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,932\nA negative though is you don't know\nwho those other customers are, right?\n\n358\n00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:35,590\nYou caouldbe running side by side with\nsomebody who is not on the up and up, or\n\n359\n00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,900\na nefarious character.\n\n360\n00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,100\nSo you can choose to do what's called\ndedicated tenancy, single tenant hardware.\n\n361\n00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,570\nAnd now when you deploy instances,\n\n362\n00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,610\nAmazon will ensure that only your VMs\nrun on a particular piece of hardware.\n\n363\n00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,650\nThe cost goes up for\n\n364\n00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,690\nthat though because it means Amazon\ncan't resell that additional hardware.\n\n365\n00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,460\nSo unless you have a ton of VM's it's not\nusually a great economical choice but\n\n366\n00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,840\nit might not be about economy.\n\n367\n00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,270\nIt might be about security.\n\n368\n00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,150\nIf you require that,\n\n369\n00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,730\nif your company policy requires it,\nthen that options right there for you.\n\n370\n00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,810\nAll right.\n\n371\n00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,980\nOn my next screen I get to pick storage.\n\n372\n00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980\nHow much hard drive space do I need?\n\n373\n00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,980\nWith every instance you're gonna\nhave at least one drive attached to\n\n374\n00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,650\nthe operating system.\n\n375\n00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,430\nYou gotta store that somewhere.\n\n376\n00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,610\nAnd so I can have that.\n\n377\n00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,190\nMine's only eight gigs in size here, and\nyou'll see it's using General Purpose SSD.\n\n378\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,230\nI can increase that size if I\nwant a 32 gig drive, or a 64 gig.\n\n379\n00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,720\nHowever big want it,\nwe can go in and specify that.\n\n380\n00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,380\nSo you've got that option right here.\n\n381\n00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,020\nYou throw it in place to get\nas much space as you need,\n\n382\n00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,280\n8 gigs is more than enough for me.\n\n383\n00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,490\nThen you choose what type of storage.\n\n384\n00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,760\nNow you've got three choices.\n\n385\n00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,250\nMagnetic, that's the old\nschool spinning drive and\n\n386\n00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,780\nit used to be a cost difference\nbetween magnetic and SSD.\n\n387\n00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,240\nThere really isn't anymore and so\n\n388\n00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,050\nthere's not really any reason\nyou'd want to use that these days.\n\n389\n00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,217\nGeneral purpose SSD, that's solid state\ndigital drives and very fast access and\n\n390\n00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,740\nit's general purpose.\n\n391\n00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,890\nThat means it's tuned for\nregular operating systems and\n\n392\n00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,010\nweb servers, just general purpose.\n\n393\n00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,361\nBut the next one's provisioned I/Os,\nright?\n\n394\n00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,182\nProvisioned I/OPS.\n\n395\n00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:08,178\nI/Os, that's input/outputs.\n\n396\n00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:13,650\nSo when you write to a hard drive or read\nfrom a hard drive that's an I/O operation.\n\n397\n00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,390\nAnd when you're running on hardware\nthat's shared with other customers,\n\n398\n00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,580\nthey're doing input and\noutput at the same time as you.\n\n399\n00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,660\nYou guys are contending for\naccess to the same hardware.\n\n400\n00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,090\nSo if I need to guarantee performance,\nif I'm gonna run a database server and\n\n401\n00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,520\nI need guaranteed input output speeds,\nI can do provisioned IO's.\n\n402\n00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,100\nAnd you can specify how many IO's\nper second you're planning on doing.\n\n403\n00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,380\nAnd Amazon will reserve that and\nensure you get it, all right?\n\n404\n00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,280\nThere's a cost associated with that.\n\n405\n00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,110\nBut if you need a guaranteed performance,\nyou can certainly do that, right?\n\n406\n00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,040\nAnd you can reserve that,\n\n407\n00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,690\nyou punch it right in here and\nnow that'll be reserved for you.\n\n408\n00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,080\nYou will always be able to get\nat least 240 IO's per second.\n\n409\n00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,220\nIf you go General Purpose,\nyou don't get that guarantee.\n\n410\n00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,090\nRight?\n\n411\n00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,571\nAnd see how I'm at 24 out of 3,000?\n\n412\n00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,820\nThat means 24 is the minimum\nthat I'm gonna get.\n\n413\n00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,690\nAnd then 3,000 is the maximum that I get.\n\n414\n00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,550\nSo I do have a cap on that.\n\n415\n00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,155\nAnd if I wanna go higher,\nI need to do provisioned IO's.\n\n416\n00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,330\nAll right.\n\n417\n00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,600\nAnd then we've got that last\noption of delete on termination.\n\n418\n00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,010\nIf I terminate this instance, do I keep\nthe drives or do I delete the drives?\n\n419\n00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,660\nNormally we want them deleted,\nand that's the default.\n\n420\n00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,060\nYou can add more drives if you want.\n\n421\n00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,110\nIf you need additional storage, if this\nis gonna be some kind of file server or\n\n422\n00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,560\ndatabase server you probably\nwill need additional drives.\n\n423\n00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,460\nYou can punch those in\nwith Add New Volume.\n\n424\n00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,023\n>> And Don with the free tier, I see that\nit does say showing it that you can get up\n\n425\n00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,800\nto 30 gigs with those SSDs or\nthe magnetic drives.\n\n426\n00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,770\nBut am I allowed to add more storage and\n\n427\n00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,290\ndivvy that up between them, or\ndo I just get one drive and that's it?\n\n428\n00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,211\n>> Yeah, it's up to 30 gigs on that first\ndrive as you start to provision more,\n\n429\n00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,960\nthose count as additional volumes.\n\n430\n00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,420\nNow, those go into\nthe elastic block store, and\n\n431\n00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,200\nEBS has its own free usage tier.\n\n432\n00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,040\nSo it may be free, it may not.\n\n433\n00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,770\nIt does get a little bit confusing,\nbut yeah, you can certainly add more.\n\n434\n00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,680\nAll right, on my next screen\nI've got where I can do tags.\n\n435\n00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680\nAnd there's only one tag by default.\n\n436\n00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,210\nThat's the name of the instance.\n\n437\n00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,990\nI'm gonna call mine itprotv-web02.\n\n438\n00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,660\nRight?\nThis is gonna be a web server.\n\n439\n00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,240\nBut you can call it whatever you want.\n\n440\n00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,010\nYou can add up to ten tags.\n\n441\n00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,170\nAnd you can use these for\nyour own purposes.\n\n442\n00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,640\nSo you can filter and control your VMs.\n\n443\n00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,680\nSo for example I might have\na tag called environment.\n\n444\n00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,310\nAnd I'm gonna say that this\none is in testing, right?\n\n445\n00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,900\nThis is in the testing environment.\n\n446\n00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,790\nAnd I might have other machines that\nare tagged as being in production.\n\n447\n00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,160\nAnd now I can filter that, I can say,\n\n448\n00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,600\njust show me VMs whose environment\ntag is set to production.\n\n449\n00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,500\nOr whose environment\ntag is set to testing.\n\n450\n00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,990\nIt gives us a way to kind of filter and\ncontrol VMs and control our output.\n\n451\n00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,880\nSo those are purely optional.\n\n452\n00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,751\nThe name is somewhat important.\n\n453\n00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,345\nNext is our security group.\n\n454\n00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:44,930\nWith Amazon,\n\n455\n00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,300\nthey provide a firewall service to filter\ntraffic to and from your instances.\n\n456\n00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,600\nThey wanna protect your instances,\nkeep them secure.\n\n457\n00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,970\nAnd so that's what I see next, and here's\nwhere I pick what access is gonna get.\n\n458\n00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:01,910\nThe default is, for a Linux box, they're\ngonna open up SSH to get to the system.\n\n459\n00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,050\nFor a Windows machine, they'll open\nup RDP, the Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n460\n00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,160\nSo you'd see RDP on port 3389.\n\n461\n00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,661\nWith Linux we see SSH on Port 22.\n\n462\n00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:12,330\nAll right?\n\n463\n00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,030\nNow, the default does say\nit's open to anywhere.\n\n464\n00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590\nAnybody can SSH to this box.\n\n465\n00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,670\nThey'll have to have a certificate,\nbut anybody can do it.\n\n466\n00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,590\nAnd they give us a warning that\nthat's not the greatest idea.\n\n467\n00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,580\nAt a minimum, we wanna change that.\n\n468\n00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,880\nAnd you can choose my IP,\n\n469\n00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,300\nand that'll update to reflect the IP\nof the workstation you're at right now.\n\n470\n00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,490\nAnd so it just switched to my public IP.\n\n471\n00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,220\nI'll be able to SSH into the system,\nnobody else can.\n\n472\n00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,550\nNow, if this is gonna be a web server,\n\n473\n00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,540\nI do want people to be\nable to get to my website.\n\n474\n00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,220\nSo I'm gonna add another rule here,\nand I'll specify HTTP.\n\n475\n00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,610\nAnd most of the protocols that you deal\nwith on a regular day are in the list.\n\n476\n00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,470\nIf they aren't you can choose to\ndo a custom TCP or UDP rule, but\n\n477\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,600\nI'm just gonna do HTTP port 80.\n\n478\n00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,640\nAnd I'll allow that from anywhere.\n\n479\n00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,830\nI want anybody on the internet\nto be able to get into this one.\n\n480\n00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,210\nAll right, that's my last option screen so\nI can hit Review a Launch.\n\n481\n00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,760\nI get a summary of all the settings\nthat I just put in place and\n\n482\n00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120\nnow I can hit my Launch button.\n\n483\n00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760\nAnd my head's covering up the Launch\nbutton, but there it is right there.\n\n484\n00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,100\nSo I go and hit Launch, and\nit's gonna spin that up.\n\n485\n00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,022\nNow there's one last question.\n\n486\n00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:16,488\nOn a Linux machine, it's going to set us\nup for SSH, and it's going to set us up\n\n487\n00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:20,503\nfor certificate based authentication\nas opposed to password based.\n\n488\n00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:24,870\nAnd so it's asking me what certificate\nI want to use, my key pair.\n\n489\n00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,670\nIf I already have a key pair,\nI can reuse it.\n\n490\n00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,660\nBut if this is my first instance,\nI'll need to create a new key pair.\n\n491\n00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,410\nSo that's what I'm to do.\n\n492\n00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,790\nI'll just choose create a new key pair,\nand I'll give it a name.\n\n493\n00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,844\nI'll call this one itprotv-web02, and\n\n494\n00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:40,830\nI'm gonna download a copy of that, and\nI'll just save that here on my desktop.\n\n495\n00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,540\nSo, I've got it, there we go.\n\n496\n00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,220\nNow, this is the only time I'll\nbe able to get that key pair.\n\n497\n00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,240\nIf I lose it, I'm gonna have to go and\njust regenerate the key pair.\n\n498\n00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,530\nSo, a little bit of a hassle there,\nbut don't lose it.\n\n499\n00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,510\nNow, once you get connected to the server,\nyou can add more user accounts,\n\n500\n00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,400\nyou can enable password\nauthentication if you want.\n\n501\n00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,820\nYou can create more key\npairs inside the server.\n\n502\n00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,380\nThis is just to get us in the first time.\n\n503\n00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,540\nAfter that, it's up to us with the rest.\n\n504\n00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,210\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch that instance and there it goes.\n\n505\n00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,100\nAnd if I go down here to view instances,\nI can jump over.\n\n506\n00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,627\nAnd I'll see I've got this new instance,\nitprotv-web02,\n\n507\n00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,700\nthat's spinning up right there, right?\n\n508\n00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,770\nNow, just real quick to\nshow you an example,\n\n509\n00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,790\nif I want to do a Windows instance,\nit's really not much different.\n\n510\n00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,275\nIf I go to launch instance,\nI can pick a Windows one.\n\n511\n00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,705\nI'll do Windows Server 2012 R2 Base.\n\n512\n00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,725\nI'll stick with just the default storage,\nI mean a default size here.\n\n513\n00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,075\nActually I might bump\nthat one up a little bit,\n\n514\n00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:37,245\nWindows gets a bit\nsluggish at 1 gig of ram.\n\n515\n00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,740\nSo I'll choose that one.\n\n516\n00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,440\nAnd I'm not gonna go\ninto any crazy details.\n\n517\n00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920\nI'll just hit Review and Launch.\n\n518\n00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,310\nBut the options are basically the same.\n\n519\n00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,360\nWhen it goes to spin up,\nit's gonna fire it up.\n\n520\n00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,880\nIt's warning me about my security group.\n\n521\n00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,440\nI need to kinda tailor those\noptions a little bit more tightly.\n\n522\n00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,072\nIt's enabling RDP for\nport 3389 from everywhere.\n\n523\n00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:57,649\nRight?\nSo\n\n524\n00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,291\nI should really restrict that down a bit.\n\n525\n00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,322\nBut I'll go ahead and launch that and\nit's gonna ask for that key pair\n\n526\n00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:06,590\nbecause Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP,\ncan use certificate authentication too.\n\n527\n00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,600\nAnd I'll just use an existing key\nthat I've already got this time, and\n\n528\n00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,980\nI'll launch that instance.\n\n529\n00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,080\nSo, not much different than\nwhen we launch a Linux one.\n\n530\n00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,084\nI didn't go through each of the individual\npages but you guys get the idea.\n\n531\n00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:20,538\nIf I go back, I've got this new\ninstance spinning up right there.\n\n532\n00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:24,869\nNow it's got no name because I didn't fill\none in but I can edit that right here.\n\n533\n00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:29,840\nSo I might call this one ITPROTV-db02 so\nthis would be a database server.\n\n534\n00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,276\nAnd so I can flag it, it's got a name.\n\n535\n00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,390\nAll the options you can go back and\nchange later.\n\n536\n00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,050\nSo I can modify the security group,\nI can modify\n\n537\n00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,240\nthe type of hardware that it's got,\nall that stuff we can change.\n\n538\n00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480\nNo big deal there.\n\n539\n00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,900\nRight here from our instance screen.\n\n540\n00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,220\nNow once the server's up and running,\nwe just need to connect to it.\n\n541\n00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,250\nAnd then we work with it like\nany old server that's right\n\n542\n00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,270\nthere in the building with us.\n\n543\n00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,476\nSo if I want to connect to this Linux box\nthat I just spun up, this itprotv-web02,\n\n544\n00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:01,052\nI need its name, and so I've got that\nname right here in my, my panels.\n\n545\n00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:04,583\nSo, I'm just going to copy that\npublic DNS name that they assigned.\n\n546\n00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:09,426\nAnd then I can jump over to a terminal,\nand I've got that\n\n547\n00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:15,530\nitprotv-web02 key that I downloaded\na few moments ago, right?\n\n548\n00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,260\nI need to secure that key real quick, so\nI'm gonna change the permissions on it.\n\n549\n00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,620\nThey key needs to read only or\nSSH won't use it, so\n\n550\n00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,380\nI'm just gonna fix that real\nquick with a little chmod 400.\n\n551\n00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,940\nThat makes it read for me and\nno access for everybody else.\n\n552\n00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,640\nSo I'm securing that key.\n\n553\n00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,345\nAnd then I can SSH into that host,\nI'm gonna import that\n\n554\n00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:42,290\nitprotv-web02 certificate and\nthen I need to specify my account.\n\n555\n00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,330\nNow, on a Windows box the default\naccount is administrator, but\n\n556\n00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,610\non a Linux box the default\naccount is ec2-user.\n\n557\n00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,060\nAnd I'll just say at and\nI'll specify the name of that server.\n\n558\n00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,470\nNow, the public dns name that they\nassigned is a pretty long one so\n\n559\n00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,130\nI'm just gonna paste that in.\n\n560\n00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,720\nAnd it's gonna reach out and connect.\n\n561\n00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,300\nI need to trust that certificate.\n\n562\n00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,540\nRight, so here is it's showing\nme that RSA fingerprint.\n\n563\n00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,940\nI'll accept it.\n\n564\n00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,700\nAnd I'm in that Linux box.\n\n565\n00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,880\nOnce I'm in there,\nit's just a Linux server.\n\n566\n00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,540\nI work with it like any other\nLinux server on my network.\n\n567\n00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,060\nSo I might wanna jump in and\nstart doing some updates.\n\n568\n00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,460\nI might want to install software.\n\n569\n00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,615\nI want this to be a web server so\nI'll install Apache.\n\n570\n00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,635\nSo, here we go.\n\n571\n00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,015\nPow, now I'm a web server.\n\n572\n00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:28,925\nI wanna be a database server,\nso I start installing that.\n\n573\n00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:32,405\nIt's no different than anything else.\n\n574\n00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:33,865\nJust a server on my network.\n\n575\n00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:36,365\nWe go and install things,\nand we're ready to rock.\n\n576\n00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:37,515\nSame thing with Windows.\n\n577\n00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:40,460\nYou'd Remote Desktop into,\nyou get your Windows desktop.\n\n578\n00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,967\nInstall your software and go.\n\n579\n00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:47,010\nGetting an instance up and running inside\na EC2 is super easy and super rewarding.\n\n580\n00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,290\n'Cause once the servers are there, now you\ndon't have to worry about the underlying\n\n581\n00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,430\nhardware, you don't have to worry\nabout the power bill, redundancy.\n\n582\n00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,480\nThat's all taken care of by Amazon you\njust get in the operating system and\n\n583\n00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,900\nyou do what you do best.\n\n584\n00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,680\nThis sure beats the old days of\nactually having to put in CDs or\n\n585\n00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,550\nmount an ISO from a USB or something\nlike that, maybe from the network.\n\n586\n00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,110\nAnd having to walk through all\nthat Windows installation.\n\n587\n00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,740\nThen grabbing the software and\ndoing all that.\n\n588\n00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,020\nThat was a lot of time consuming process.\n\n589\n00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,740\nYou spun that Windows Server up in\nliterally like, what, 20 seconds,\n\n590\n00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,400\nmaybe that?\n\n591\n00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,080\n>> Yeah.\nYep.\n\n592\n00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,830\nI didn't have to order anything,\nit's just done and you're in place.\n\n593\n00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,830\nIt's really, really cool stuff.\n\n594\n00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,480\nAll right, now, we've really just\nscraped the tip of the iceberg on this.\n\n595\n00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,128\nWe've shown you how to spin up an instance\nand get a server hosted in EC2.\n\n596\n00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:39,180\nBut there are a ton of options available\ninside EC2 that are just super powerful.\n\n597\n00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,290\nThe redundancy that you can do,\nthe geo-locating, it's just amazing,\n\n598\n00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,240\nit blows your mind.\n\n599\n00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,410\nSo definitely stay tuned for\nour other episodes on that.\n\n600\n00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,310\nBut as far as a basic primer of\ngetting instances fired up in EC2,\n\n601\n00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,200\nI think we pretty much covered that.\n\n602\n00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,110\n>> Yeah, good job.\n\n603\n00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,380\nWell, hopefully you guys\nhave enjoyed this episode.\n\n604\n00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,090\nThat being said, it's about time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n605\n00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,540\nI've been you're host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n606\n00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,070\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n607\n00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,589\n>> And

greetings.\n\n4\n00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:15,216\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,025\nI'll be your host, Daniel Laury.\n\n6\n00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,785\nHere with me today,\nis my good friend, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,825\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n8\n00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:20,835\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:21,595\nI'm excited because today,\n\n10\n00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:25,315\nwe're going to be jumping into\nsecurity groups inside of Amazon EC2.\n\n11\n00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,835\nAnd if you're not familiar\nwith security groups,\n\n12\n00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,265\nit's kind of like a Software Firewall or\n\n13\n00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:33,975\na filtering service that Amazon\nprovides for all of your EC2 services.\n\n14\n00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:38,280\nAnd it's pretty important because\nbelieve it or not, it's not so\n\n15\n00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,660\nnice people out there on the Internet.\n\n16\n00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,830\n>> Say it ain't so, Don.\n\n17\n00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,281\n>> I know it's shocking, and when you host\nyour servers up in Amazon's EC2 Cloud,\n\n18\n00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,186\nit's visible to the world.\n\n19\n00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:49,926\nWe need to be able to partition them off.\n\n20\n00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,670\nSeparate it and\nonly allow the traffic that we want.\n\n21\n00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,650\nAnd this is something we traditionally\ndo with, like Hardware Firewalls.\n\n22\n00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,444\nBut Amazon makes it super easy\nwith a Web Managed Interface.\n\n23\n00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:02,195\nTo be able to just add ports,\nremove ports.\n\n24\n00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,450\nKind of set-up that configuration.\n\n25\n00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,480\nWe just need to know to do it and know\nsome basic practices to secure our system.\n\n26\n00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,060\n>> Now, Don is the level of security\nthat this firewall entails that,\n\n27\n00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,180\nat the same level something like\na Cisco ASA, or on that kind of ability.\n\n28\n00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,200\n>> Yeah, for the most part.\n\n29\n00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,190\nA lot of the firewall vendors out\nthere have kind of started to deviate.\n\n30\n00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,540\nAnd if you take a Cisco ASA,\nit's not just a firewall anymore.\n\n31\n00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,240\nIt does VPN service,\nit does all this other crazy stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,530\nThe security groups,\nthey're just a true native firewall.\n\n33\n00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,580\nYou put in your ports and that's it.\n\n34\n00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,800\nSo it's not going to do things\nlike Network Address Translation.\n\n35\n00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,410\nWhat you certainly can do that, inside of\nAWS, it's got support for NAT, and VPN,\n\n36\n00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,460\nand all that.\n\n37\n00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,410\nBut the security groups, just a firewall.\n\n38\n00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,920\nAnd honestly, I prefer that better,\nbecause I know,\n\n39\n00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,950\nI'm going to this one service.\n\n40\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,630\nIt does one thing.\n\n41\n00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,915\nI configure it, And that's it, doesn't get\nmuddied with all the other technology.\n\n42\n00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:51,775\n>> Yeah, keep it simple, right?\n\n43\n00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,835\n>> So whenever we spin up\na new instance inside of EC2,\n\n44\n00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:59,613\nwe need to be thinking about,\nwhat that instance is going to do, right?\n\n45\n00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:03,175\nIf I'm bring-up a web server,\nwhat's that web server going to do?\n\n46\n00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,515\nWell, it's gonna serve up a web page.\n\n47\n00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:07,565\nSo, I want people to be\nable to get that web page.\n\n48\n00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:11,240\nAnd they're gonna use HTTP,\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol.\n\n49\n00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,800\nAnd that's going to use TCP [INAUDIBLE].\n\n50\n00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,810\nRight, that's the port that\nweb traffic goes over.\n\n51\n00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,350\nThat's really the only thing,\n\n52\n00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,760\npeople on the Internet would\nneed to get to that server on.\n\n53\n00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,960\nSo, I need to restrict that access down.\n\n54\n00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,660\nNow, you can do that in\nyour Operating System.\n\n55\n00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,430\nIf you got a Windows Server, you got\nthe Windows Firewall that can do it.\n\n56\n00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,570\nIn Linux, you've got IP Tables,\nthey can do it.\n\n57\n00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,670\nThere's a ton of other\nways to go about it.\n\n58\n00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,960\nBut the problem there, is the traffic\nhas already made it to your server.\n\n59\n00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,570\nAnd if you're server that's blocking it,\n\n60\n00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,060\nwouldn't it be nice if we could block it\nbefore it even made it to the server?\n\n61\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,170\nAnd that's what security groups are all\nabout, is taking care of that for us.\n\n62\n00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,340\nSo, let me give you a little\ntour of how that works, and\n\n63\n00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,840\nwe'll get a chance to see it in action.\n\n64\n00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,470\nNow, when you create a Virtual Machine in\nEC2, so when I spin up a new instance.\n\n65\n00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,290\nIt asks me, if I want to use\nan existing security group or\n\n66\n00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,430\nif I want to create a new one.\n\n67\n00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,420\nAnd, we normally just\nlet it create a new one.\n\n68\n00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,680\nSo as you set up instances,\nyou're probably creating many, many,\n\n69\n00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,710\nmany of these resources.\n\n70\n00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,580\nSo for example, if I launch an instance\nhere, I'll just launch a quick Linux AMI.\n\n71\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,940\nSo, I'll go ahead and pick one.\n\n72\n00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,230\nI'll do a micro.\n\n73\n00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,070\nAnd, I'm not really gonna change much.\n\n74\n00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,080\nI'm just gonna move through this\nwizard and as I go through.\n\n75\n00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,100\nAnd I see various settings about it,\nshutdown behavior, all that storage, tags.\n\n76\n00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,540\nI'll give it a name,\nthis'll be ITProTV-web03.\n\n77\n00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,280\nSo, this'll be my third web server and\nthen, it asks about that security group.\n\n78\n00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,090\nI can pick an existing security group if\nI've got one or I can create a new one.\n\n79\n00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,800\nA Security Group is basically a Firewall.\n\n80\n00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,690\nAnd you can have more than one\ninstance share the same Firewall.\n\n81\n00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,890\nIf I have five web servers and\nthey all need port 80 to get to them,\n\n82\n00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,930\nwhy have five separate firewalls for that?\n\n83\n00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,550\nI can just have one.\n\n84\n00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,820\nBut if I have two servers that\nprovide completely different roles.\n\n85\n00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,310\nI have a Database Server and a Web Server.\n\n86\n00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,460\nThe Web Server needs port 80.\n\n87\n00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,430\nThe Database Server needs 3306.\n\n88\n00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,680\nIf I put them behind the same firewall,\n\n89\n00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280\nI'm gonna have to open\nup both those ports.\n\n90\n00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,070\nAnd that means, I'm opening up web\naccess to the Database Server.\n\n91\n00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,990\nAnd that's not what I want.\n\n92\n00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,160\nSo there,\nI'd need to do Multiple Firewalls.\n\n93\n00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,640\nMultiple Security Groups to protect that.\n\n94\n00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,110\nNotice what it's allowing by default,\non a Windows machine.\n\n95\n00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,360\nIf you choose a Windows instance,\n\n96\n00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,760\nit's going to allow Remote Desktop\nProtocol, which is TCP port 3389.\n\n97\n00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,830\nThat's allowing Remote Desktop for you to\nlog into the machine and configure it.\n\n98\n00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,890\nFor a Linux box,\nit's SSA which is TCP port 22.\n\n99\n00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:40,080\nIn either case, SSH or RDP,\nit allows it from anywhere.\n\n100\n00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,660\nAnd that's the first thing\nthat we need to change.\n\n101\n00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,780\nIf I leave it set to anywhere, that means\nanyone in the world could fire-up SSH.\n\n102\n00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,970\nOr in Windows fire-up RDP,\nand connect to my server.\n\n103\n00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,610\nAnd they're going to get\na certificate message.\n\n104\n00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,430\nThey can just say, yes to that.\n\n105\n00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,210\nAnd then they're going to Logon Prompt.\n\n106\n00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,190\nAnd so, they can now attempt to brute\nforce their way into that server.\n\n107\n00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,190\nThey can try to guess Username and\nthe Password.\n\n108\n00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,520\nThat's not good, so\nwe want to protect ourselves from that.\n\n109\n00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,510\nAnd the easiest way to do\nthat is to restrict it.\n\n110\n00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,650\nTo say, I don't want to allow\nthat connection from anywhere.\n\n111\n00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,740\nI want to allow it from\nsomewhere specific.\n\n112\n00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,320\nAnd Amazon is a really cool service here.\n\n113\n00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,410\nYou can choose my IP and it's going to\nset it to whatever the IP address is,\n\n114\n00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,860\nthat your browsing\nthe Internet from right now.\n\n115\n00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,460\nOkay, so\n\n116\n00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,530\nif I choose that, there is I put in my\npublic IP, that's the one I'm coming from.\n\n117\n00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,810\nNow, only I will be able\nSSH into the system.\n\n118\n00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,850\nBut, what if I'm at home when\nI'm setting this up and I know,\n\n119\n00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,430\nI'm gonna be at the office later.\n\n120\n00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,510\nWell, I can come in and\nadd another rule for SSH.\n\n121\n00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,910\nAnd this time, I can put in a custom IP.\n\n122\n00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,220\nAnd in the custom IP field,\nI can come in here, and\n\n123\n00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,550\nI can specify something\na little bit bigger.\n\n124\n00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,170\nMaybe another network and\nlet me zoom in a little bit on this,\n\n125\n00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,190\nbecause now it's ultimately small.\n\n126\n00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,330\nSo that didn't quite scale very well,\ndid it?\n\n127\n00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,827\nBut we can punch in an IP range,\nlike I'll punch in a bigger office range.\n\n128\n00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,394\nSo 209.251.159 and then,\n\n129\n00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:09,507\nhere I can come in and say like 179/32.\n\n130\n00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,760\nThat's my individual IP.\n\n131\n00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,410\nBut this is actually part of a bigger\nsubnet that if I remember right,\n\n132\n00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,750\nstarts at 177 and\nis like a slash, what is it?\n\n133\n00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,900\nA /26 I believe is what we have.\n\n134\n00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,100\nSo I can specify something like this,\nas a bigger network.\n\n135\n00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,450\nAnd now it's getting more than one IP.\n\n136\n00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,900\nAnd now all the IP addresses here at\nmy office would be able to connect in.\n\n137\n00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,710\nAnd use SSH to access this server.\n\n138\n00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,440\nSo it's up to you specify those ranges,\nget them put in there.\n\n139\n00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,700\nNow, I'm just doing SSH right here,\nSecure Shell.\n\n140\n00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,540\nBut if this is gonna be a web server,\nI need to add a little more to it.\n\n141\n00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,910\nI need to add HTTP.\n\n142\n00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,580\nI'm gonna leave that off, right now, cuz\nI want to show you guys this in action.\n\n143\n00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,540\nSo I'm just going to enable SSH,\nand I'll go, and hit review.\n\n144\n00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,260\nAnd watch.\nSo that's going to go and\n\n145\n00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,710\ncreate that instance.\n\n146\n00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,010\nAnd I'll need to pick a key pair.\n\n147\n00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,980\nI've already got a key.\n\n148\n00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,760\nI'll just use that one.\n\n149\n00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,470\nAnd it's going to spin\nup that instance for me.\n\n150\n00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,430\nAnd I'll have it.\n\n151\n00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,390\nNow, the security group that I created.\n\n152\n00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,300\nIf I go back into my easy to service,\non the left side here,\n\n153\n00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,920\nI can go to instances and\nI see my instances.\n\n154\n00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,000\nAnd I can find web03.\n\n155\n00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,140\nAnd in web03's settings\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n156\n00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,830\nyou'll see what security group it's in.\n\n157\n00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,340\nSo we created one called launch-wizard-3,\ngreat name.\n\n158\n00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,020\nIt was just a generic name.\n\n159\n00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,930\nBut I can see it.\n\n160\n00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,990\nI can click on that.\n\n161\n00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,160\nAnd here's where I can\nsee that security group.\n\n162\n00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,730\nAnd if I don't like that name,\nI can rename it right here.\n\n163\n00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,440\nAnd I'm gonna do that.\n\n164\n00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,380\nI'm gonna call it, itprotv-web03.\n\n165\n00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,030\nSo I can remember, what this is tied to.\n\n166\n00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,950\nSo, I'm just gonna give that\nlittle group a name right there.\n\n167\n00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,020\nSo that I can kind of recognize that.\n\n168\n00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,780\nAnd I can come through.\n\n169\n00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,077\nAnd I can edit those rules inbound,\nand outbound.\n\n170\n00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,516\nIt does both directions.\n\n171\n00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:56,251\nThe default is, only that SSH traffic is\nbeing allowed to come into the server.\n\n172\n00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,206\nAnd everything is being allowed\nto come out of the server.\n\n173\n00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:00,529\nWe might want to limit that.\n\n174\n00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,656\nWe might wanna block or\nallow certain access for\n\n175\n00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,860\nthe server to be able to get to, and\nwe can certainly do that right here.\n\n176\n00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,680\nAll right, now once that instance spins\nup I should be able to SSH into it.\n\n177\n00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,220\nLet me go check my instance status and\nsee where it's at.\n\n178\n00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,450\nAnd it looks like it is running.\n\n179\n00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,340\nIt's still initializing but I'll probably\nbe able to get into it at this point.\n\n180\n00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,350\nWhen you first put up an instance it's\ngotta load some additional software which\n\n181\n00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,090\ncan take a moment.\n\n182\n00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,810\nBut it should be far enough along for\nme to connect.\n\n183\n00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,220\nSo I'm going to copy that host name and\njump over to a terminal window.\n\n184\n00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,860\nLooks like I'm still on\none of my other servers.\n\n185\n00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,720\nSo I'm going to SSH over\nto that guy real quick.\n\n186\n00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,480\nAnd we should be able to get in now.\n\n187\n00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,840\nI'm using SSH, so\nit's going to connect on TCP port 22.\n\n188\n00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,705\nAnd when I go.\n\n189\n00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:48,610\nOh, I got some bad permissions on my key,\nlet me just fix that real quick.\n\n190\n00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,570\nAnd there we go.\n\n191\n00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,300\nAnd now I'm in.\n\n192\n00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,000\nSo I'm able to SSH into that server and\naccess it.\n\n193\n00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,180\nAll right,\nwell I want it to be a web server.\n\n194\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,660\nSo let me just real quick\ninstall a web server on it.\n\n195\n00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:11,460\nAll right, so now it's got Apache,\nand we can fire that up.\n\n196\n00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,590\nWe'll fire up the HTTP service.\n\n197\n00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,510\nOops, HTTP, if I spell it right.\n\n198\n00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,950\nSo we'll start that service up and\nlet me make sure that it starts on boot.\n\n199\n00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,710\nAnd we'll set that, there we go.\n\n200\n00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,550\nSo now I'm a web server.\n\n201\n00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,020\nI should be able to browse to this server\nand get the Apache test page, right?\n\n202\n00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,040\nNot anything fancy, just a simple\nlittle test page that I should see.\n\n203\n00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,280\nIf I jump over to a web browser though,\nand I browse to that host.\n\n204\n00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,507\nAnd I'll make sure to just do HTTP://.\n\n205\n00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,830\nSo I'm gonna browse to it.\n\n206\n00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,050\nIt's just sitting here.\n\n207\n00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,730\nI can't get to it, right?\n\n208\n00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,330\nAnd the reason is,\nI only allowed SSH just from my machine.\n\n209\n00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,280\nThis traffic has been blocked,\nI can't even get to the server.\n\n210\n00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,050\nBetter yet,\ntrying to exploit it using HTTP.\n\n211\n00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,800\nAnd that's really what we want to see,\nwe want that to be blocked.\n\n212\n00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,370\nAnd if I go back to my security group.\n\n213\n00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,220\nSo I'm gonna go back to\nthe security group for this guy.\n\n214\n00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,470\nI'll go to security groups, and I'll\nfind that ITProTV web03 security group.\n\n215\n00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,390\nAnd on inbound I'm just\ngonna edit those rules.\n\n216\n00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,970\nI'm gonna add a new rule.\n\n217\n00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,000\nI'll add a rule for HTTP, and most of the\nprotocols that we use on a regular basis,\n\n218\n00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,230\nright here on the list.\n\n219\n00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,840\nBut you certainly can do a custom rule,\nand specify whatever port you want.\n\n220\n00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,840\nIf you choose custom and you put in like\nport 80, it'll change it to show HTTP for\n\n221\n00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,570\nyou later on anyway, so they map that.\n\n222\n00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,180\nThey don't really care if it's custom or\nyou pick a shortcut, but\n\n223\n00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,490\nI'll take a shortcut here and go HTTP.\n\n224\n00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,110\nTCP 80, and\nI'm gonna allow that from anywhere.\n\n225\n00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,970\nIt's a web server.\n\n226\n00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,460\nI want anybody in the world to be able\nto connect to this web server, so\n\n227\n00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,700\nI'll specify that and I'll save it.\n\n228\n00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,970\nAnd now that new entry will be in there,\nor that new entry should be in there.\n\n229\n00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,030\nRefresh my screen here.\n\n230\n00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,530\nIt didn't show up.\n\n231\n00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,700\nThere it is.\n\n232\n00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,190\nSometimes your web page might\nnot refresh automatically, so\n\n233\n00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,470\nI just have to do a manual refresh there.\n\n234\n00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,820\nBut I can see HTTP in the list, and\n\n235\n00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,370\nif I go back to my web browser,\nChrome has already refreshed it for me.\n\n236\n00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,400\nThere's my test page, all right?\n\n237\n00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,360\nSo that shows you how this firewall works,\nquick and easy.\n\n238\n00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,670\nWe just add the ports,\n\n239\n00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,010\nit takes effect right away Now\npeople can get to that, right.\n\n240\n00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,580\nIt's important that you set\nthis up because, an attacker,\n\n241\n00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,560\nthey're going to do various\nfinger printing attacks.\n\n242\n00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,860\nThey're gonna reconnaissance attacks.\n\n243\n00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,710\nThey're going to scan your server,\nlook for any open port.\n\n244\n00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,860\nAnd an open port is an attack vector for\nthem.\n\n245\n00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,010\nThey can use to get into your service.\n\n246\n00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,420\nAnd so you need to restrict that,\ncut it back.\n\n247\n00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,380\nNowhere is that more important\nthan on a database server.\n\n248\n00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,300\nDatabase servers are the most sensitive\nbecause if somebody can get in your\n\n249\n00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,420\ndatabase, they can get\ntons of data out of there.\n\n250\n00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,490\nSo we have to be really guarded when\nit comes to our database servers.\n\n251\n00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,960\nNow here's where things get\na little bit challenging.\n\n252\n00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,580\nWhen you start spinning up instances,\nthe instances, even if they're in the same\n\n253\n00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,850\nsecurity group, they're not really\nallowed to talk to each other.\n\n254\n00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,270\nSo if I have a web server, and\n\n255\n00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,870\nI need that web server to be able\nto talk to a database server.\n\n256\n00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,560\nWhat I really need to do Is split them\ninto two different security groups, and\n\n257\n00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,380\nconfigure communications\nbetween the security groups.\n\n258\n00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,030\nIt's a neat little configuration we do,\nbut\n\n259\n00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,410\nit gives us really granular control\nover who's allowed to talk to who.\n\n260\n00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,980\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n261\n00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,300\nIf I go back here To my console.\n\n262\n00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,590\nI've got two instances that\nI created before the show.\n\n263\n00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,380\nI've got itprotv-web01, it's a web server.\n\n264\n00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,420\nAnd if I scroll over here,\nI can see the security group it's in.\n\n265\n00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,550\nI just call it itprotv-webapp01.\n\n266\n00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,170\nAll right, so there's that security group.\n\n267\n00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,330\nAnd I created another server,\nIT Pro TV DBO1.\n\n268\n00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,240\nIt's a database server, and\nif I scroll all the way to the side here.\n\n269\n00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,430\nI'll see it's in IT Pro TV web app 01.\n\n270\n00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,990\nThey're in the same security group.\n\n271\n00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,230\nSo you might assume that they could\ntalk to each other, but they can't.\n\n272\n00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,800\nThey're really isolated from each other.\n\n273\n00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,590\nAmazon wants these things to be protected.\n\n274\n00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,970\nIf somebody hacks into one server, they\ndon't want them to be able to leapfrog to\n\n275\n00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,910\nyour other servers and\nreally just compromise all your systems.\n\n276\n00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,480\nSo it's isolated.\n\n277\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,420\nSo with these guys in the same\nsecurity group I have another problem.\n\n278\n00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,810\nIf I open up port 80 for web access, it's\ngoing to open port 80 for both of them.\n\n279\n00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,880\nNotice when we reconfigure\nthe security groups,\n\n280\n00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,640\nwe're specifying\nthe traffic as it comes in.\n\n281\n00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,550\nWe're not specifying a destination, right?\n\n282\n00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,450\nSo it can't disseminate between\none instance and another.\n\n283\n00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,830\nSo that's where I'm gonna need\nmore than one security group.\n\n284\n00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,720\nAnd so what I've done, is if I go\ninto my security group list here\n\n285\n00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,930\nI have whipped up a couple of\nextra security groups for me.\n\n286\n00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,625\nInstead of just ITProTV-webapp01,\nI made one called\n\n287\n00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:45,390\nITProTVwebap01-dbservers for my database.\n\n288\n00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,970\nI left it at a default.\n\n289\n00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,610\nIt's just SSH being allowed on it and\nthat's it And\n\n290\n00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,610\nI'll update this name\nfield over here also.\n\n291\n00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,420\nSo we can see that on each\nof the different outputs.\n\n292\n00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,570\nSo I'll just punch that in.\n\n293\n00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,500\nThere.\n\n294\n00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,820\nAnd I created another one called\nitprotv-webapp01-webservers.\n\n295\n00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,700\nAnd this is where I'm going to have my\nweb servers for this particular app.\n\n296\n00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,050\nGranted, they're all part of the same app,\nbut\n\n297\n00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,840\nthey have independent or\nindividual security needs.\n\n298\n00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,820\nSo I'm gonna split those out.\n\n299\n00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,630\nAnd on the web servers, I might\nwant to allow HTTP from everywhere.\n\n300\n00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,980\nSo I'll come in here, and\nI will allow HTTP from everywhere,\n\n301\n00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,440\nas soon as I find HTTP in the list.\n\n302\n00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,030\nI have to looked right over it,\nthere it is.\n\n303\n00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,340\nI'll allow that from anywhere.\n\n304\n00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,510\nOkay, so that's gonna be great for those\nweb servers, but the database servers.\n\n305\n00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,445\nWho do I want to allow to\nconnect on the database ports?.\n\n306\n00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,210\nReally just that web server.\n\n307\n00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,010\nI want any of my web servers to be\nable to talk the database server, but\n\n308\n00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,190\nI don't want the Internet to be\nable to talk the database server.\n\n309\n00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,710\nSo I'm starting to get\na little more specific with\n\n310\n00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,960\nwho I'm allowing to communicate.\n\n311\n00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,470\nSo that's where I've got to start\ntweaking things a little bit.\n\n312\n00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,940\nThe challenge we have is if we're\nusing something like auto scaling.\n\n313\n00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,710\nI might be adding or removing instances,\n\n314\n00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,750\nto that web app security group,\nthe web server security group.\n\n315\n00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,090\nAnd some of those nodes might have\npublic IPs, some might have private IPs.\n\n316\n00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,940\nThey might have both, and I don't know\nif they're coming from the public or\n\n317\n00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,620\nthe private IP.\n\n318\n00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,220\nIt makes it really challenging\nto add them to this source list.\n\n319\n00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,590\nSo one of the really cool\nfeatures about these lists\n\n320\n00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:31,170\nis that we can add in not just IPs, but\nyou can add in entire security groups.\n\n321\n00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,965\nSo when I go to my database security\ngroup, this guy right here,\n\n322\n00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:42,980\nitprotv-webapp01-dbservers, it's allowing\nSSH from my IP so I can get into it.\n\n323\n00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:50,126\nBut if I edit that I can add in another\nrule and I'm going to allow MySQL access.\n\n324\n00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:55,355\nWhich is TCP Port 3306 and for\nthe IP address, if I choose that box and\n\n325\n00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:59,928\nI just type the letter s It's\ngoing to list my security groups.\n\n326\n00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:04,380\nAnd now I can authorize an entire security\ngroup instead of specific IPs, right?\n\n327\n00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,710\nRegardless the IP of a system in there,\nit's gonna do that security group,\n\n328\n00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,120\nwhich is a really cool way to\ngo about setting that in place.\n\n329\n00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,810\nNow I created a security group\na moment ago called ITProTVWebApp03.\n\n330\n00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,600\nNotice how it's not on the list?\n\n331\n00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,380\nWell the reason it's not\nlisted is I just created it.\n\n332\n00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,980\nThis list doesn't update right away.\n\n333\n00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,970\nSo usually within ten minutes or so\nit'll turn up, but if you come in here and\n\n334\n00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,450\nyour security group's not on the list,\ndon't fret.\n\n335\n00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,970\nYou can still type it in.\n\n336\n00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,800\nYou just need the security name.\n\n337\n00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,700\nSo you have to go back to your\nsecurity group screen back here, and\n\n338\n00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,260\nget the group ID, and you can type it in.\n\n339\n00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,470\nOr you can just wait ten minutes and\nit'll show up in here.\n\n340\n00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,590\nBut these other groups, I created them\nearlier, so I knew they would show up.\n\n341\n00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,820\nSo I can choose, that's my security\ngroup for the web servers.\n\n342\n00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,380\nI can choose that one.\n\n343\n00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,100\nAnd now, any server that I stick in the\nweb server security group will be allowed\n\n344\n00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,140\nto access this security group,\nthe database servers, on TCP 3306, right?\n\n345\n00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,560\nThat's a really neat feature,\ncuz I don't have to remember those IPs.\n\n346\n00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,366\nAnd I know any servers I stick in there\nin the future will be taken care of,\n\n347\n00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,170\nthey'll be covered, and it'll be in there.\n\n348\n00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160\nRight?\n\n349\n00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,020\nNow I am missing one other component.\n\n350\n00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,450\nI've got my rules set the way I want them,\nright?\n\n351\n00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,800\nThe entire world can access my web\nserver security group on port 80.\n\n352\n00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,350\nThe entire world can\naccess that web server.\n\n353\n00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,660\nAnd then, in theory, the web server\ncan access the database servers, but\n\n354\n00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,760\nthe internet cannot.\n\n355\n00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,890\nSo that's set up great.\n\n356\n00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,525\nBut my servers aren't in\nthe security groups yet.\n\n357\n00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:38,195\nMy servers are still up here in\nITProTVwebapp01 so I need to move them.\n\n358\n00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,845\nNow if you've used EC2 before, or\n\n359\n00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,285\nif you used it years ago and\nhave kind of gotten out of it.\n\n360\n00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,865\nIt used to be that you couldn't\nchange a security group of the server\n\n361\n00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,585\nbut now you can.\n\n362\n00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:50,570\nSuper easy we just go\nup to our instances and\n\n363\n00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,340\nwe find the instance that\nwe want to manipulate.\n\n364\n00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,180\nSo I'm gonna take ITproTVweb01,\nand if I go under actions and\n\n365\n00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,780\nnetworking, you can change\nthe security group.\n\n366\n00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,850\nAnd I'm gonna move web01 into web servers.\n\n367\n00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,300\nAnd you can actually be in more than\none security group if you want, but\n\n368\n00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,620\nI'm just gonna move straight\nover into webapp01.\n\n369\n00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,770\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and assign that.\n\n370\n00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,110\nSo that ones now moved over,\n\n371\n00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,390\nand I can scroll all the way over here to\nverify that it is now in that other group.\n\n372\n00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,370\nAnd then I'm gonna go in here and\nfind db01.\n\n373\n00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,800\nAnd notice how I made\nsure to uncheck web01.\n\n374\n00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,590\nI wanna make sure I don't\ndrag that one along with me,\n\n375\n00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,690\nright, cuz you can assign this to more\nthan one server at the same time.\n\n376\n00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,910\nI'll take db01, and I'll go to Actions,\nNetworking, Change Security Group.\n\n377\n00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,450\nAnd I'm gonna move that one over\nto the DB Servers security group.\n\n378\n00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,390\nAnd I'll go ahead assign that and\nnow it's in place.\n\n379\n00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,360\nNow they each have their own rules.\n\n380\n00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,760\nThe web server, anybody in\nthe world can get to it on port 80,\n\n381\n00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,160\nthe database server I can\nget to it on SSH and the web\n\n382\n00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,030\nservers that are in that web app security\ngroup, they can get to it, and that's it.\n\n383\n00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,180\nIt's limited.\n\n384\n00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,070\nWell, let's test it and\nsee that in action.\n\n385\n00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,520\nIf I take a look at db01,\nI can see its public DNS name,\n\n386\n00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,770\nits public IP and private IPs.\n\n387\n00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,220\nI'm gonna take that\npublic IP that it's got.\n\n388\n00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,160\nActually, you know,\nI'll take the DNS name.\n\n389\n00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,630\nThere's an advantage for\nconnecting to DNS names.\n\n390\n00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,790\nWhen you use a DNS name, if you're outside\nof EC2 it'll resolve to the public IP.\n\n391\n00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,000\nBut if you're inside the EC2 environment\nIt'll resolve to the private IP.\n\n392\n00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840\nAnd you actually get a faster\nconnection because of that.\n\n393\n00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,150\nYou're not bouncing through the routers or\nthe NAT translation rules, and all that.\n\n394\n00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,250\nSo I'm gonna use that DNS name to connect.\n\n395\n00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,110\nAnd, oh well you know actually,\nI'm kind of forgetting.\n\n396\n00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,902\nI need to connect the web server itself.\n\n397\n00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:45,010\nI wanna test the web server\nconnecting to the database so\n\n398\n00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,160\nI need to get connected to it first.\n\n399\n00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,680\nSo let me get that guy's host name and\nwe'll remote into him.\n\n400\n00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,350\nAll right, so I'm gonna connect.\n\n401\n00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,170\nI'll do a little import of\nmy key which is this key and\n\n402\n00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:04,830\nI'm gonna log in as EC2 user at that host,\nall right.\n\n403\n00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,700\nAnd there we go and\nnow I'm on that web server.\n\n404\n00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,360\nAnd the web server, I want to test it,\naccessing that database server.\n\n405\n00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,880\nNow the database server,\nif I go back here, I can get its name.\n\n406\n00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,410\nAnd so I'll just find that and\ncopy its name.\n\n407\n00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,480\nAnd we'll see if I can connect.\n\n408\n00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,450\nSo I'm gonna connect to a host,\nand for that host name,\n\n409\n00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,550\nI'll just provide that full name.\n\n410\n00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,290\nAnd I should have an account for\nmyself if I remember right, and\n\n411\n00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,758\nI'll provide the password inline.\n\n412\n00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:39,161\n[SOUND] And let's see if we can\ndo a show databases on this guy.\n\n413\n00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:43,483\nAnd sure enough I'm connected to MySQL and\nI'm able to query the database and\n\n414\n00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:44,890\npull that information.\n\n415\n00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,470\nSo I am able to access that\ndatabase right from here.\n\n416\n00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,260\nIf I were to go and\nturn that line off, right?\n\n417\n00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,818\nSo if I go to my security groups.\n\n418\n00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:57,610\nOops, wanna go back to my security\ngroups here and I find that web app for\n\n419\n00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,200\nthe database servers, and I edit it.\n\n420\n00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,980\nAnd I'll just take that MySQL rule and\nI'm just gonna get rid of it.\n\n421\n00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,670\nOkay.\n\n422\n00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,460\nNow that security group shouldn't\nhave access to the database server.\n\n423\n00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,890\nSo if I try that same line again,\n\n424\n00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,360\nwhen I go to connect,\nit'll sit here and it'll stall.\n\n425\n00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,670\nThis security group just lost access.\n\n426\n00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,460\nSo security groups pretty\neasy to configure.\n\n427\n00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,780\nWe set an IP address that's important.\n\n428\n00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,680\nOr we set a security\ngroup to give it access.\n\n429\n00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,710\nAnd this allows us to partition that\nout without having to mess around with\n\n430\n00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,290\nvirtual networks.\n\n431\n00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,550\nRight, creating separate VPCs.\n\n432\n00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,470\nRight, were doing all of\nthis right here in one VPC.\n\n433\n00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,160\n>> This is a really smart thing that\nthey have done with the AEWF stuff.\n\n434\n00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,850\nThe ability to take that group membership,\n\n435\n00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,570\ncreate a role, and\nthen just put your servers into that.\n\n436\n00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,410\nNow all the permissions are set.\n\n437\n00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,680\nVery, very nice and taking a little\nhint from Microsoft in their GDP or\n\n438\n00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,310\nwhatever was back in the day.\n\n439\n00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,413\n>> Yeah, and speaking of Microsoft,\none of my favorite features about this,\n\n440\n00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:55,562\none of the reasons I like security group\nso much, and there are some people out\n\n441\n00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:58,840\nthere that say you know what I don't\nwant to use Amazon security groups.\n\n442\n00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,480\nAnd they just put one rule in\nthat says allow everything.\n\n443\n00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,813\nAnd then they use the firewalls in\nLinux or the firewalls in Windows,\n\n444\n00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,350\nthey use that feature.\n\n445\n00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,700\nWell that's great, you can do that.\n\n446\n00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,370\nBut I like the fact that regardless of\nwhether I have a Windows machine, or\n\n447\n00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,080\na Linux machine, or\n\n448\n00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,910\nI might have five different Linux distros,\nthe security group is the same.\n\n449\n00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,400\nI'm configuring security the same way, and\n\n450\n00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,940\nthat lessens the chance\nof me making a mistake.\n\n451\n00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,190\nBecause maybe I'm a Linux guy, and\nso I know IP tables inside and out.\n\n452\n00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,750\nBut I don't use Windows that much.\n\n453\n00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,237\nAnd so I go that Windows firewall rule and\n\n454\n00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:32,190\nI configure it wrong cuz\nI don't use it that much.\n\n455\n00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,870\nAnd now my server's vulnerable.\n\n456\n00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,640\nBut here I just have security groups,\nI use them for everything.\n\n457\n00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400\nAnd it doesn't matter what OS is behind\nit, I've got a security group and\n\n458\n00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,460\nit's configured and in place.\n\n459\n00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,130\n>> Yeah.\nPlus you have the added advantage of\n\n460\n00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,100\nsaying I could even have an appliance,\na firewall appliance for\n\n461\n00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,990\nevery server if I wanted to get that\nfine grain or do the security groups.\n\n462\n00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,420\nObviously that's the way to go.\n\n463\n00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,860\n>> And\nyou know you mention the appliances,\n\n464\n00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,620\nI do know people who if you really\nwant special rules or special control.\n\n465\n00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,910\nThe security groups can be\na little limited, right?\n\n466\n00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,280\nEspecially when it comes to\nprotocols that jump ports, like FTP.\n\n467\n00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,530\nFTP, you connect on 21, and then it'll\njump to 20 to do file transfers,\n\n468\n00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,290\nand so it kinda bounces back and forth.\n\n469\n00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,700\nOr protocols that switch from TCP\nto UDP midstream, those things\n\n470\n00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,660\ncan cause problems in security groups,\nthe rules can be a little complex.\n\n471\n00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,300\nSo you could put a security group\nrule in that said allow traffic,\n\n472\n00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,740\nallow all traffic, just anything.\n\n473\n00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,080\nAnd then you can bring up an appliance,\n\n474\n00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,610\nlike you bring up pfSense in a virtual\nmachine, and use that as your firewall.\n\n475\n00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,990\nAnd then have it in a security group where\nall traffic is allowed to pfSense and\n\n476\n00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,890\nthen have a security group rule that\nallows just pfSense to be able to get to\n\n477\n00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,720\nyour machines that are behind it and\nyou can control access that way.\n\n478\n00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,850\nSo you can use dedicated appliances or\n\n479\n00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,440\nfirewall appliances software, whatever,\nto be able to provide that functionality.\n\n480\n00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,380\nBut the security groups,\nyou guys saw it was, and\n\n481\n00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,370\nI don't have to pay for an extra instance.\n\n482\n00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,830\nThe security groups are just a part\nof what I've already spun up right.\n\n483\n00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,460\n>> Right, and\nevery added piece of security we have is\n\n484\n00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,995\na benefit to you, right?\n\n485\n00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:08,225\nEvery piece of security saying that's\nanother fence that the bad guys have to\n\n486\n00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:11,285\njump to get to your data or\ncause some havoc.\n\n487\n00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,595\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n488\n00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:15,485\nNow one little piece of advice\nI do want to give you guys is,\n\n489\n00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:19,235\nas you spin up more and more instances,\na lot of times people is automatically\n\n490\n00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:23,175\nchoose to create new security groups and\nit can get really confusing.\n\n491\n00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,323\nYou can end up with hundreds\nof security groups and\n\n492\n00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:28,450\na lot of them will have names\nlike Launch Wizard Seven.\n\n493\n00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,050\nAnd so it's easy to lose sight\nof who something is tied to.\n\n494\n00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,300\nSo just be aware when you're\non the instance list,\n\n495\n00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,160\nlet me get back to my instance list here.\n\n496\n00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,450\nWhen we're looking at the list\nof instances in our account,\n\n497\n00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,870\nyou can scroll over on that screen, and\n\n498\n00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,200\nit'll show you which security group\neach of your instances are in.\n\n499\n00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,560\nAnd these are hotlinks.\n\n500\n00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,330\nSo if you click on these, it'll go right\nto that security group to make sure you're\n\n501\n00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,610\nconfiguring the right one, the one that's\nactually assigned to that instance.\n\n502\n00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,710\nAnd when you go to the security group\nlist over here, if I go to networking and\n\n503\n00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,610\nsecurity, and security groups I see all my\nsecurity groups listed right here, right?\n\n504\n00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,170\nWith their descriptions if\nwe chose to provide one.\n\n505\n00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,360\nAnd when you choose one of these\nsecurity groups, down at the bottom\n\n506\n00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,490\nyou get the description,\nyou get some basic information.\n\n507\n00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,330\nAnd it'll actually tell you some basic\nthings that you set during the install,\n\n508\n00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,600\nif you set them.\n\n509\n00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,340\nBut if you choose one\nof these generic ones,\n\n510\n00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,860\nlet me find one that is just\nLaunch Instance whatever.\n\n511\n00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,330\nHere, Launch Wizard One, right?\n\n512\n00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,360\nWhen I look down here I\ndon't necessarily see which\n\n513\n00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,600\nvirtual machines are tied to this.\n\n514\n00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,210\nI can see the rules and\n\n515\n00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,380\nthe tags but I don't really know\nwhere this one's being utilized.\n\n516\n00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,460\nSo it's a good idea to come in here and\nclean these things up.\n\n517\n00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,870\nIf you're not using them, if you've\nmoved your instances out of there,\n\n518\n00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,870\njust clean them up, delete them,\notherwise they do build up over time.\n\n519\n00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,580\n>> Well, Don, have we thoroughly\ncovered these security groups?\n\n520\n00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,010\nI know I learned a lot on this,\nit's very good stuff.\n\n521\n00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,640\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, definitely tune back in.\n\n522\n00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,800\nWe'll do an episode on VPCs later on.\n\n523\n00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,950\nThere's a different type of security\ngroup, called a VPC security group,\n\n524\n00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,640\nthat let's you provide protection\nbetween subnets, between IP subnets.\n\n525\n00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,660\n>> Wow.\n\n526\n00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,030\n>> Small environment,\nyour not gonna use that.\n\n527\n00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,350\nBut large environments, you may.\n\n528\n00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,420\nSo we'll see some more on that.\n\n529\n00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,240\nBut as far as basic security groups,\nthat's basically it.\n\n530\n00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,600\n>> All right, that's very awesome.\n\n531\n00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,650\nWell I guess we've wrapped up another\nshow here at ITProTV studios.\n\n532\n00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,480\nSigning off.\n\n533\n00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,820\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n534\n00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,760\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n535\n00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,955\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n536\n00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:24,920\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14,755\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,520\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,330\nHere with me today is my good friend and\ncolleague, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,480\nHow're you doing today, Don?\n\n8\n00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,400\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,125\nWe've got a good show lined up because\nwe're gonna be taking our servers,\n\n10\n00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,400\nour instances that we brought\nup in the previous episode.\n\n11\n00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,562\nAnd doing some little bit\nof advance configurations.\n\n12\n00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,290\nSome follow-up tasks that will normally\nperform on an instance that we\n\n13\n00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,390\nbrought up in EC2.\n\n14\n00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,160\n>> Yeah, very cool.\n\n15\n00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,410\nSo, we're talking about actually,\nnot just doing one server but\n\n16\n00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,570\ndoing multiple servers.\n\n17\n00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,090\nAnd then, doing maybe even a little\nbit of backup of those services.\n\n18\n00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,000\nStuff like that.\n\n19\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,468\n>> Yeah, so in the previous episode,\nif you didn't catch it,\n\n20\n00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:49,146\nwe showed how to create an instance or\na virtual machine in EC2.\n\n21\n00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:53,500\nOnce you get it up and running, you remote\ninto it, you configure it, and off you go.\n\n22\n00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,780\nBut there's a few other things that we\nmight need to do to get that machine ready\n\n23\n00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,620\nfor prime time.\n\n24\n00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,120\nAnd one of the big ones Is backing it up.\n\n25\n00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,870\nNow, Amazon's official stance is the best\nway to back-up your virtual machine,\n\n26\n00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,300\nis through the operating system\ninside of that instance.\n\n27\n00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,510\nSo, if you're running Linux or Windows or\nwhatever, they've all got various systems\n\n28\n00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,090\nfor backing them up,\nyou can certainly use those.\n\n29\n00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,230\nBut, if you don't have anything,\n\n30\n00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,540\nAmazon does provide what's\ncalled the Snapshot Service.\n\n31\n00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,320\nNow, the Snapshot Service\nhas its limitations.\n\n32\n00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,830\nAnd so, there's a reason why most people\ndon't necessarily want to use it, but\n\n33\n00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,040\nit is there, it's a great option,\nif you just don't have anything else.\n\n34\n00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,580\nThe way the Snapshot Service works,\nis it takes a, well a snapshot.\n\n35\n00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,580\nIt takes an image of the hard drives for a\nvirtual machine, and freezes them in time.\n\n36\n00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,150\nAnd then your virtual\nmachine keeps running.\n\n37\n00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,730\nYou can make changes to it,\ndo whatever you want.\n\n38\n00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,420\nAnd if anything ever goes wrong, you can\nrestore that snapshot of the hard drive.\n\n39\n00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,180\nYou can put the hard drive back to\nthe way it was before the problem.\n\n40\n00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,560\nAnd now you're up and running again.\n\n41\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,010\nSo if you have a bad software update.\n\n42\n00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,000\nYou get infected with a virus.\n\n43\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,630\nYour server gets compromised.\n\n44\n00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,340\nYou can roll it back to the way\nthat it was before that happened.\n\n45\n00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,135\nNow, key thing to remember here,\nthe snapshots are just of the hard drive.\n\n46\n00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:05,895\nJust a storage device, it doesn't do RAM.\n\n47\n00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:10,165\nSo, if your server is running\nwhen you take this backup,\n\n48\n00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:11,265\nit doesn't get what's in RAM.\n\n49\n00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,995\nSo, it doesn't get that running operation.\n\n50\n00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:15,975\nIt's just what saved to the hard drive and\nthat's it.\n\n51\n00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:18,655\nSo, that's the first thing\nthat we need to think about.\n\n52\n00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,475\nThe other thing is,\nsince it's just imaging the hard drive,\n\n53\n00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,350\nthere is the possibility that\nyou can create a bad backup.\n\n54\n00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,420\nIf your server is running.\n\n55\n00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,040\nIf the instance is actually up and\noperational and\n\n56\n00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,420\nit's partially written\ndata to the hard drive.\n\n57\n00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,910\nAnd we take a snapshot, our snapshot\nnow includes partially written data.\n\n58\n00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,370\nThe other part of the data is in\nRAM still waiting to be written.\n\n59\n00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,290\nThat doesn't make it into the snapshot and\nnow I might have a bad backup.\n\n60\n00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,320\nSo, with snapshots, what we really\nneed to do is shut the instance down.\n\n61\n00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,440\nTurn it off so that you know it's not\nwriting to its hard drives anymore, and\n\n62\n00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,390\nthen take the snapshot.\n\n63\n00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,960\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nsnapshots are not right for everybody.\n\n64\n00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,460\nIf you need your server to be up,\nmission critical, 24-7, well,\n\n65\n00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,870\nyou don't want to shut it down.\n\n66\n00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,240\nAnd Amazon's response to that is,\nwell, if it's mission critical and\n\n67\n00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,450\nyou need it 24-7, shouldn't you\nhave more than one of that server?\n\n68\n00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,570\nAnd that way,\nyou could shut one node down and\n\n69\n00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,788\nback it up while the others\nare running in carrying the load.\n\n70\n00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,080\nAnd that's sbsolutely true.\n\n71\n00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,490\nThat's what you should do.\n\n72\n00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,350\nAnd that's why snapshots are useful but,\nif you've got a single server instance\n\n73\n00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,200\nthen you really need to use whatever\nbackup solution your operating system has.\n\n74\n00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,650\nCuz they'll likely run while\nthe server is up and running.\n\n75\n00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,940\n>> Yeah, I used to use snapshots a lot\nwhen I was upgrading software on servers.\n\n76\n00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,810\nThis made my life infinitely more easy\nthan it did before we had snapshots.\n\n77\n00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,520\nI could shut that server down,\ntake a snapshot of it and\n\n78\n00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,045\nI knew if anything went wrong,\nwhich things like that tend to happen,\n\n79\n00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:45,140\n[LAUGH] I could just roll\nback to that snapshot.\n\n80\n00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,680\nEverything would be the way it was.\n\n81\n00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,160\nTry to figure out what went wrong with\nthat software installation or upgrade or\n\n82\n00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,490\nwhatever the case may be and\nthen move from there.\n\n83\n00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,840\nAnd then again, take another snapshot.\n\n84\n00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,360\nAnd try to reinstall work from there or\nmaybe have to call a vendor at that point.\n\n85\n00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,740\nBut it made my life so much easier cuz\nI didn't have to worry about messing up\n\n86\n00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,310\nthe server and having to roll back or\nrestore from tape or anything like that.\n\n87\n00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,920\n>> Now the snapshot process\nitself is really simple.\n\n88\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,230\nSo it is super easy to use.\n\n89\n00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,187\nLet me show you here on\nsome instances that I have.\n\n90\n00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,957\nSo, here are my instances, I've got two.\n\n91\n00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:18,270\nNow I do have a web server that's up and\nrunning right now.\n\n92\n00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,190\nAnd I've got a web\nserver that's shut down.\n\n93\n00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,910\nThat they're actually the same image, so\nthat they are configured the same way.\n\n94\n00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,360\nI can take a snapshot of either one,\nnow you might think, hey,\n\n95\n00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,730\nI'm gonna take a snapshot of the server.\n\n96\n00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,220\nI need to come right here\nunder instances and do it.\n\n97\n00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,860\nBut one of the things you'll notices is\nthat, when you start going in here and\n\n98\n00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,390\nlooking through your options.\n\n99\n00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,090\nThat there's not really\nan option to take a snapshot.\n\n100\n00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,790\nAnd that's because the snapshot\nis not a snapshot of the running\n\n101\n00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,330\nconfiguration of that instance,\nit's a snapshot of the volumes.\n\n102\n00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,040\nSo I really need to go to the drives,\ndown here, to Volumes.\n\n103\n00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,200\nAnd I can create the snapshot\none of two ways.\n\n104\n00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,790\nI can go to Volumes,\npick the drive here, and\n\n105\n00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,970\nthen under Actions,\nwe have Create a Snapshot.\n\n106\n00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,680\nI can snapshot the drive.\n\n107\n00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,630\nOr I can go to the Snapshots menu,\nand right from here, I can hit\n\n108\n00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,480\nCreate Snapshot, and I can come in and I\ncan pick the volume there too, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280\nEither way, it's the same thing.\n\n110\n00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,570\nYou're just taking\na snapshot of that drive.\n\n111\n00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,370\nThe challenge though,\nare the volume names.\n\n112\n00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,190\nWhich one belongs to which server?\n\n113\n00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,390\nIt's hard to tell here.\n\n114\n00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,280\nAnd that's where we need to make sure\nthat we label things, and that way,\n\n115\n00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080\nwe're able to track what they belong to.\n\n116\n00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,870\nSo when I go up here to Volumes,\nI see these two volumes.\n\n117\n00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,120\nI know they belong to my two web servers.\n\n118\n00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,140\nAnd if you click on them, you'll see\ndown here information about that system,\n\n119\n00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,250\nincluding what server they're attached to.\n\n120\n00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,650\nSo I can see that this volume,\nthe top one, is attached to ITProTVweb01.\n\n121\n00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,430\nSo I might add that to the name, just so\n\n122\n00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,130\nthat I can remember that's\nwho it's attached to.\n\n123\n00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,420\nAnd I just know by process of elimination.\n\n124\n00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,640\nThis guy's ITProTVweb00, where I can see\nthat right down here in the information.\n\n125\n00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,580\nSo now, I've labelled my volumes and\nI know which one belongs to which.\n\n126\n00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,570\nSo if I want to take\na snapshot of one server or\n\n127\n00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,970\nthe other, I can pick the correct volume,\nall right?\n\n128\n00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,170\nSo I'll start here with ITProTVweb01.\n\n129\n00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,720\nThat's the one that's running right now.\n\n130\n00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200\nSo it is running.\n\n131\n00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,940\nAnd you'll see, I can create a snapshot.\n\n132\n00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,050\nIt'll let me create a snapshot\nof that running machine.\n\n133\n00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,100\nIt will create a micro-outage.\n\n134\n00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,610\nSo for a couple of seconds,\nthat machine will freeze for\n\n135\n00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,240\na moment while it goes to grab that drive.\n\n136\n00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,550\nSo if this is a mission critical system,\n\n137\n00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,490\nif I have to have this thing,\nthat micro-outage might be a problem.\n\n138\n00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,340\nSo again, snapshots,\nwe've got to be careful with it but\n\n139\n00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,850\nif it's not super critical.\n\n140\n00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,570\nIf I've got other nodes that are taking\nover then, there's no big deal there.\n\n141\n00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,110\nAnd I can create my backup, so\nI'll call this ITProTVweb01 snapshot.\n\n142\n00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,160\nAnd I give it a description.\n\n143\n00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,130\nUsually, you put something in here like,\nDaniel,\n\n144\n00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,070\nyou gave the example of\ninstalling software.\n\n145\n00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,240\nSo prior to updating to version 6.5,\nsomething like that.\n\n146\n00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,470\nYou can choose to encrypt it, if you've\ngot storage that's encryption capable.\n\n147\n00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,330\nI don't have that set up, so I don't\nhave that option and I'll hit, Create.\n\n148\n00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,520\nSo it's gonna create that snapshot.\n\n149\n00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,550\nThat server's running and so for\na brief moment, it's gonna pause.\n\n150\n00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,290\nAnd then, it'll pick back-up again.\n\n151\n00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,590\nAnd the snapshot'll finish creating.\n\n152\n00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,320\nMy other server's actually off right\nnow and so I'll come down to it and\n\n153\n00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320\nI'll create its snapshot.\n\n154\n00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,310\nAnd on this one, server's off, so it's not\nlike we've got an outage to worry about.\n\n155\n00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,410\nBut, I'll give it a name and\na description.\n\n156\n00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:32,000\nMaybe this is prior to updating to version\n6.5, and we'll hit, Create on that.\n\n157\n00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,075\nAnd now I've got a snapshot\nbuilding up of those.\n\n158\n00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,065\nOkay.\n\n159\n00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:39,695\nNow, the neat part about this process is\nthat, when I go down here to Snapshots,\n\n160\n00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:42,925\nI'll see snapshots that I made,\nand they're just churning along.\n\n161\n00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,668\nThis one's still actually building.\n\n162\n00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:48,143\nThe one of ITProTVweb00,\nit's already done.\n\n163\n00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:53,398\nThe other one, I typed web01 on that one.\n\n164\n00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:54,458\nI typed the wrong name.\n\n165\n00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,558\nYou can easily fix that though.\n\n166\n00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,038\nI'll just go in here and change that.\n\n167\n00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,658\nThere, so.\n\n168\n00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,578\n[LAUGH]\n>> A little snafu.\n\n169\n00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:03,738\n>> You know, the human error.\n\n170\n00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:04,398\n>> That's right.\n\n171\n00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:07,030\n>> [LAUGH] So we've got that set.\n\n172\n00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,680\nIt's running.\n\n173\n00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,530\nThat snapshot will finish.\n\n174\n00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,800\nThere it is, so it's done.\n\n175\n00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,060\nDidn't take very long, right?\n\n176\n00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,380\nIt was only eight gigs of data.\n\n177\n00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,780\nit's not like I asked it\nto do rocket science here.\n\n178\n00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,620\nBut it finishes pretty quickly.\n\n179\n00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,350\nNow my servers, they're still running,\nthey're doing their thing,\n\n180\n00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,980\neverything running fine.\n\n181\n00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,380\nBut if something fails,\n\n182\n00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,710\nsomething goes wrong, I can now roll the\nserver back and get it back in operation.\n\n183\n00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,680\nSo the trick here is that it's\nnot as easy as right-click and\n\n184\n00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,780\nhit restore or something.\n\n185\n00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,240\nIt, like you'd see in VMWare ESX or\n\n186\n00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,570\nMicrosoft Hyper-V, solutions like that you\ncan just roll back to snapshot, right?\n\n187\n00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,450\nWith Amazon, the snapshots\nare a little bit more powerful.\n\n188\n00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,120\nYou can take these snapshots, and\nyou can do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n189\n00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,710\nLike you can create duplicates of them.\n\n190\n00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,350\nYou can create images, so\n\n191\n00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,580\nyou can actually create all new servers\nbased off of these snapshots if you want.\n\n192\n00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,150\nSo you get tons of flexibility there.\n\n193\n00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,318\nIf a server were to have a problem, so\n\n194\n00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:05,028\nlet's say that I go up here to my\ninstances and this guy, Web00.\n\n195\n00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,060\nSomething happens.\n\n196\n00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,100\nMaybe a hacker gets in there and\nthey delete my website and\n\n197\n00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,210\nthey put up all sorts of nasty stuff, and\nthen I don't necessarily know how they got\n\n198\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,920\ninto the machine, so I don't know what\nthey might have changed or manipulated.\n\n199\n00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,830\nAnd I say boy, I really just wish I could\nput this server back to the way it was\n\n200\n00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,380\nbefore the compromise and then patch and\nupdate it to protect that problem, right?\n\n201\n00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,050\nSo I just need to get back in time,\nback to that snapshot.\n\n202\n00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:35,430\nWell, what you actually do is you create\na new volume based off of that snapshot.\n\n203\n00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,640\nYou detach the volume from your production\nserver, and then you attach the new copy.\n\n204\n00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,203\nLet me show you that in action,\n\n205\n00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:44,645\nbecause it makes a little more sense\nwhen you kind of see it going on.\n\n206\n00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:48,979\nWhen I look at ITProTVweb00, right down\nhere I can see it's description, you know,\n\n207\n00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,580\ninformation about it.\n\n208\n00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,130\nAnd right here I can see its\nroot device and block device.\n\n209\n00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,040\nSo it's got one hard drive.\n\n210\n00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,482\nAnd the hard drive is\nmounted at /dev/xvda, right?\n\n211\n00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,648\nI need to remember that, so\nI'm actually going to copy that just so\n\n212\n00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:05,212\nI can store it because I'm going to need\nto attach that same mount point when\n\n213\n00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,505\nthis is all said and done.\n\n214\n00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,470\nI then go down to my snapshots and\n\n215\n00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,040\nI find the snapshot of that server\nright here which is still pending.\n\n216\n00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,269\nI'll use the other snapshot because\nthey're basically the same.\n\n217\n00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,816\nSo I come down here and I take this\nother snapshot that I've got and\n\n218\n00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:23,138\nI create a volume based off of it.\n\n219\n00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:26,380\nSo I'm just gonna go to actions and\ncreate volume, all right?\n\n220\n00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,810\nAnd it's gonna basically\nwhip up a new volume for me.\n\n221\n00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,070\nAnd I'll just pick the same size and all\nthat information, nothing too crazy there.\n\n222\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,680\nAnd it's gonna create that volume.\n\n223\n00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,110\nAnd when I go under my volumes,\n\n224\n00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,680\nI'll see this new unattached\nvolume right there, right?\n\n225\n00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,840\nThat's the snapshot that I just recovered.\n\n226\n00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,620\nI'm going to name that one\nITProTV-web00-recovered so\n\n227\n00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,900\nthat I can keep this straight.\n\n228\n00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,390\nAnd I'll take this one, the one that's\nactually attached to the server right now\n\n229\n00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,470\nand I'll call that one faulty.\n\n230\n00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,744\nAll right, the faulty one is attached\nto the server, I can see it right here.\n\n231\n00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:09,128\nAnd if I didn't get that path earlier,\nI can see it here too /dev/xvda,\n\n232\n00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,343\nit's right there.\n\n233\n00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:13,230\nOkay, that's where it's\nattached right now.\n\n234\n00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,790\nAnd then my recovered one, well,\nit's not attached to anything.\n\n235\n00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,470\nSo all I have to do is detach this guy and\nattach this guy and\n\n236\n00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,560\nnow we're rolled back in time.\n\n237\n00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,340\nNow we're back on that snapshot,\neasy as that.\n\n238\n00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,949\nWell that's not totally easy I guess.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,880\n>> So I needed to complete that.\n\n240\n00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,330\nI need to make sure that server\nis still off which it should be.\n\n241\n00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,990\nYou want your server off if you're going\nto be swapping around hard drives,\n\n242\n00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,370\nif its the boot drive.\n\n243\n00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,030\nIf it's not the boot drive you might\nbe able to get away with other systems.\n\n244\n00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,130\nBut the boot drive,\nyou typically need the instance to be off.\n\n245\n00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,310\nAnd mine is, so I'm just gonna come in\nhere and I'll take this faulty drive, and\n\n246\n00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,540\nI'm going to detach it.\n\n247\n00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,805\nSo we detach that.\n\n248\n00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:54,850\nNow ITProTVweb00 has no hard drives.\n\n249\n00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,930\nIt won't boot, right?\n\n250\n00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,380\nIt's dead in the water.\n\n251\n00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,780\nWell, whenever that finishes.\n\n252\n00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,320\nNow, it might delay while it does that\nbecause the snapshot was still creating.\n\n253\n00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,740\nAnd so that's probably going to delay it\nwhile it does that I'll do the same thing\n\n254\n00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,732\nhere on ITProTV-web01,\nI'll just attach it too.\n\n255\n00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:13,260\nOh [LAUGH] it's actually running\nsee how it stopped me there\n\n256\n00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,609\nbecause the servers running?\n\n257\n00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,715\nI want to detach the boot drive from\na server that's actually up and going,\n\n258\n00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,470\nso that'll be a problem there.\n\n259\n00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,930\nSo I might have to wait for\nthis one snapshot to finish.\n\n260\n00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,170\n>> Nice that they warn you though.\n\n261\n00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,034\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is useful.\n\n262\n00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:28,804\n>> That could be bad if you detach\nan actually active hard drive.\n\n263\n00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:31,850\n>> Yeah, otherwise that system\nis just gonna flake out.\n\n264\n00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,430\nIt'd be like your hard drive being yanked\nout of the system while it's running.\n\n265\n00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,390\nIt's just gonna freeze.\n\n266\n00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,520\nSo, all right so once I detach that drive,\n\n267\n00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,660\nthough, all I have to do\nis attach the new volume.\n\n268\n00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,300\nAnd attaching the new volume is\npretty straightforward, right?\n\n269\n00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,170\nIf I go into my volumes and\n\n270\n00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,760\nI take this recovered drive,\nI can go up here to Attach Volume.\n\n271\n00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,740\nAnd when you attach, it you pick which\ninstance you're going to attach to, so\n\n272\n00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,980\nI'll attach it to web00, right?\n\n273\n00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,980\nAnd then you pick the mount point,\nnow be careful here.\n\n274\n00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,320\nWhen you attach a volume, Amazon on has no\nidea what it should be mounted to, right?\n\n275\n00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,460\nIt's up to you to tell it.\n\n276\n00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,295\nAnd in the notes here, see how it's\ntelling Linux devices are normally\n\n277\n00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:12,849\n/dev/sdf all the way through /dev/sdp?\n\n278\n00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:16,810\nWell, that's true for secondary\nstorage but not for the boot volume.\n\n279\n00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:23,190\nFor the boot volume,\nit expects it to be in /dev/xvda, right.\n\n280\n00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,350\nA zen virtual disk A, XVDA.\n\n281\n00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,740\nSo that's where it expected to be,\nso I need to put that in here\n\n282\n00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,490\neven though it doesn't say that here in\nthe description of this big warning note.\n\n283\n00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,310\nIt's because I'm replacing\nthe boot volume.\n\n284\n00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,171\nI know what it needs to be because I paid\nattention to it before I disconnected\n\n285\n00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:37,807\nit, all right.\n\n286\n00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:42,911\nI'll go ahead and attach that and\nnow ITProTVweb00 is attached\n\n287\n00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:49,610\nto the hard drive ITProTVweb00-recovered\nthat I've built off of that snapshot.\n\n288\n00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,870\nAnd if I go back to my instances and\nI find web00, here it is, stop.\n\n289\n00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,700\nIf I look down here,\nI can find its volumes, its root device.\n\n290\n00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,800\nAnd if I were to click on that, it will\ntell me about what's mounted to it.\n\n291\n00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,860\nWell, it's giving me the block ID number,\nbut\n\n292\n00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,140\nif I follow that paper trail,\nIt's itprotv-web00-recovered.\n\n293\n00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,210\nAnd now I can go and start that instance.\n\n294\n00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,900\nAnd when that instance starts up, it's now\n\n295\n00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,380\ngoing to be booting off that other drive,\nthe recover drive.\n\n296\n00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,350\nIt's now back in time, all right.\n\n297\n00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,380\nNow I had an outage here, didn't I?\n\n298\n00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,490\nWhen I spun that instance down,\nwhen I shut it off, detached its drive,\n\n299\n00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,350\nattached the restored snapshot and\nbrought it back up.\n\n300\n00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,820\nBut if you're doing this in\nresponse to a compromise or\n\n301\n00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,630\nsomething you needed that server to go\ndown anyway so it's not a big deal.\n\n302\n00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,820\nBut just be aware that there are outages\ninvolved here with going ahead and\n\n303\n00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,350\nrestoring that.\n\n304\n00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,070\nAll right so those snapshots,\nkind of important right?\n\n305\n00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,640\nIf you're about to make\na software change and\n\n306\n00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,920\nyou might need to quickly roll it back,\nthat's one way to go about it.\n\n307\n00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,140\nAnother way as I could of\nmade an AMI off of it.\n\n308\n00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,970\nIt's a lot more involved to go that way,\ntakes longer to deploy again.\n\n309\n00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,610\nBut doing it this way pretty quick.\n\n310\n00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,881\nAs long as you know the steps to do.\n\n311\n00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,090\n>> Very cool.\n\n312\n00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,020\n>> So that's one thing.\n\n313\n00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,580\nIf you just spun up some\nnew servers inside of EC2,\n\n314\n00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,880\nyou need some kind of backup.\n\n315\n00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,910\nMaybe use your own software.\n\n316\n00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,340\nmaybe use the snapshot feature.\n\n317\n00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,920\nEither way that's one thing we need to do.\n\n318\n00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,860\n>> That's right.\n>> Another thing static IPs.\n\n319\n00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,902\n>> Now Don we were talking\nabout this before the show and\n\n320\n00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:20,850\nit seems that Amazon once you actually\ndecommission one of your servers.\n\n321\n00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,990\nThat IP that gets assigned along with it,\nwell it goes right back to Amazon and\n\n322\n00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,050\nyou no longer have it.\n\n323\n00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,310\nBut what if I'm requiring that IP,\nI've built my life upon that IP,\n\n324\n00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,030\nand now it's gone?\n\n325\n00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,880\nCan I keep it?\n\n326\n00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,790\nWhat can I do?\n>> Yep.\n\n327\n00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,530\nAnd that's where\nthe the elastic IPs come in.\n\n328\n00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,930\nSo Amazon has tens of thousands\n\n329\n00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,960\nof other customers that are running\nservers in the same data centers you are,\n\n330\n00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,620\nand they have pools of public\nIPs that are available.\n\n331\n00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,423\nAnd when you spin up an instance,\nit grabs one of those IPs, right?\n\n332\n00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:53,833\nLike if we look at my instances here,\nI've got ITProTV-web00, and\n\n333\n00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:58,681\nway over here it's got its public DNS\nname, right, that's attached to it and\n\n334\n00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,564\nit doesn't quite fit on\nthe screen very well.\n\n335\n00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:04,024\nBut over here is the public IP.\n\n336\n00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:07,247\nNow, that IP was assigned\nto my instance right there.\n\n337\n00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:11,860\nSo 54.84.128.251, that's the IP it's got.\n\n338\n00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,440\nIf I stop that instance, so\nI'll just take an instance and stop it,\n\n339\n00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,850\nwhen you do that it's going to\ngive that IP back to Amazon and\n\n340\n00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,650\nAmazon can issue that to another customer.\n\n341\n00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,050\nRight?\nMy server's off.\n\n342\n00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,400\nIt doesn't need an IP,\nso I just gave it away.\n\n343\n00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,150\nAll right and then when I turn the server\nback on it's going to get a new IP and\n\n344\n00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,460\nif it's fast enough maybe it just\nhappens to get the same IP again.\n\n345\n00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,690\nBut Amazon spins up thousands\nof servers per minute, so\n\n346\n00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,160\nit's not something that is very common,\nto get the same IP.\n\n347\n00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000\nSo the odds are I'm gonna\nget a different IP.\n\n348\n00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,230\nIs that a big deal?\n\n349\n00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,110\nMaybe not.\n\n350\n00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,620\nIf this server's behind a load balancer,\n\n351\n00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,730\nyour clients don't know about\nthe IP anyway, so who cares, right?\n\n352\n00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,740\nAnd that's what most people do.\n\n353\n00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,520\nBut if you've got a DNS record\nthat points to this IP,\n\n354\n00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,660\nthat points to this server, and now that\nIP changes, your DNS record is wrong.\n\n355\n00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,780\nAnd DNS can take a while to update,\nso you don't wanna rely on that, and\n\n356\n00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,625\nyou don't want your customers being\ndirected to somebody else's server,\n\n357\n00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,030\ncuz Amazon will reissue that IP.\n\n358\n00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,810\nSo, we need to make sure that we\nhave an IP that we always have,\n\n359\n00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,680\neven if the instance is turned\noff that we keep for us.\n\n360\n00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,960\nAll right.\n\n361\n00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,190\nAnd the way we do that is with\nwhat's called an elastic IP.\n\n362\n00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,603\nOver here on the left side,\nI can go down and I can find elastic IP,\n\n363\n00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:28,670\nit's right here and this is where we\ncan reserve addresses that are ours,\n\n364\n00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,340\nthat are tied to our account.\n\n365\n00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,390\nNow Amazon knows that when you\nhave a service that's up and\n\n366\n00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,500\nrunning you need at least one IP address.\n\n367\n00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,460\nSo when you grab these static IPs,\nthey don't charge you.\n\n368\n00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,680\nThey're free.\n\n369\n00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,210\nSo, why would I go dynamic\nif these are free?\n\n370\n00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,390\nWell, they're free while\nyour server is running.\n\n371\n00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,230\nIf you shut your server down though, you\ndon't need an IP for a shutdown server.\n\n372\n00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,930\nBut you're holding one, and\nso they charge you for it.\n\n373\n00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,180\nNow I don't remember the exact price.\n\n374\n00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,120\nIt's something massive like $0.25 a day or\nsomething.\n\n375\n00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,968\nIt's tiny, tiny little amount, right?\n\n376\n00:17:58,968 --> 00:17:59,768\n>> Break the bank.\n\n377\n00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:01,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not a big deal.\n\n378\n00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,040\nSo you'll normally want to go in and\nreserve a couple IPs for\n\n379\n00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,520\nyour servers if you want to always know\nwhat their IP address is going to be.\n\n380\n00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,067\nAnd all you do is it Allocate New Address,\nright?\n\n381\n00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,370\nAnd it's going to allocate one,\nand there it is.\n\n382\n00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,340\nNow I've got an IP, right?\n\n383\n00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,590\nNow the IP is not attached to anything.\n\n384\n00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,170\nI have to go to attach it to a server,\nbefore it's actually in use.\n\n385\n00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,660\nBut I have this one reserved, and\nI can come in and allocate a few more and\n\n386\n00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,230\njust go through and get as many\nas I need to build my own pool.\n\n387\n00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,720\nAnd now I've got control of those IPs,\n\n388\n00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,100\nregardless of whether I attach\nthem to a server or not.\n\n389\n00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,630\nThey're right there.\n\n390\n00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,130\nThey're available.\n\n391\n00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,500\nNow, if I go back to my instances and\n\n392\n00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,011\nI take ITProTV.web00, right, this guy\ndoesn't have an IP right now cuz it's off.\n\n393\n00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,000\nAnd if I start that instance up,\nall right.\n\n394\n00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,870\nSo here it's gonna start.\n\n395\n00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,140\nIt's initializing.\n\n396\n00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,980\nAs soon as it starts to boot, Amazon's\ngoing to assign it and IP address.\n\n397\n00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,510\nRight.\n\n398\n00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,000\nAnd I'm impatient so\nI'm gonna hit refresh.\n\n399\n00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,470\nAnd it should get the IP any moment now.\n\n400\n00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,900\nSo it's gonna come up,\nit's gonna get that IP address.\n\n401\n00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,590\nAnd the odds are it's not gonna be\nthe IP that it had a moment ago.\n\n402\n00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,190\nSo I'm gonna give it just a moment here.\n\n403\n00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,110\nI'm being impatient.\n\n404\n00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,368\nBut I just want to see that it\nactually does get a different address.\n\n405\n00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,208\nThere it goes.\n\n406\n00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,948\nSo it just got an address 52.1.250.13.\n\n407\n00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,848\nThat's kind of cool IP.\n\n408\n00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:24,918\nBut the IP that it had before, I copied it\nso I could remember, it was 54.84.128.251.\n\n409\n00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:25,870\nSee, it's a completely different IP.\n\n410\n00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,440\nWhen you shut off an instance,\nyou lose your IP.\n\n411\n00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,900\nBut now I can go down here.\n\n412\n00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,770\nActually, I need to wait for\nit to finish booting up, or\n\n413\n00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,900\nmaybe I'll use this other\nserver as my example.\n\n414\n00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,239\nI'll use level one.\n\n415\n00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:42,995\nBut once it boots up, and\nit actually shows a positive health check,\n\n416\n00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:46,620\nsee my status check is still initializing.\n\n417\n00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,230\nWhen you change the static IP, Amazon\nactually reaches into the virtual machine\n\n418\n00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,760\nfor you and modifies it so\nthe OS recognizes that it has that and\n\n419\n00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,690\nso a lot of times it's\na good idea to wait for\n\n420\n00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,985\nyou to pass your health checks before\nyou start Assigning IPs to it.\n\n421\n00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,145\nThere we go.\nI just got a positive health check.\n\n422\n00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:06,845\nAnd I'm still initializing there, so well,\nwe'll push anyway, we'll see what happens.\n\n423\n00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:10,205\nSo if we go down here to our elastic\nIPs I can pick an IP address,\n\n424\n00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:14,195\nlike this guy right here, and\nI can associate the address, and\n\n425\n00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,645\nI can pick an instance to tie it to.\n\n426\n00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,925\nIf your instance has more than one\nnetwork interface you can pick\n\n427\n00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,710\nthe specific interface too so\nthat may be something that you need.\n\n428\n00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,740\nBut I'm going to come in here and pick\nan instance and I'll attach it to web00.\n\n429\n00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,390\nAnd the private IP is the IP\nthat's being used on the inside.\n\n430\n00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,490\nWe don't normally have to\nworry about that too much,\n\n431\n00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,950\nunless you've got like\nmultiple VPCs to find it.\n\n432\n00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,950\nIf you've got private networks,\n\n433\n00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,680\nyou might want to stick it on\none of those versus another one.\n\n434\n00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,260\nBy default, if this address is\nalready assigned to another instance,\n\n435\n00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,070\nit won't reassign it.\n\n436\n00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,728\nIf you choose Reassociation, it'll\ndetach it from whoever it has now and\n\n437\n00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:52,085\nthen attach it to this one.\n\n438\n00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,905\nThat's not what I'm doing, all right.\n\n439\n00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,578\nSo when I associate it, now this new IP,\n\n440\n00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:05,285\nthis 52.5.154.163,\nthat is attached Itprotv-web01.\n\n441\n00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,326\nOr, I think it is.\n\n442\n00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:09,461\n[LAUGH] So if we go back to our instances,\n\n443\n00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:14,125\nwe can look in here and\nsure enough that guy ends in 163.\n\n444\n00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,840\nAnd see how that's a hotlink.\n\n445\n00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,070\nI can click on it.\n\n446\n00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,530\nThis one isn't, right.\n\n447\n00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,740\nThis one's an IP managed by Amazon,\nso there's nothing to click on.\n\n448\n00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,160\nBut this one's a hotlink that'll\ntake me to the elastic IP page\n\n449\n00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,740\nwhere I can see where it's assigned and\n\n450\n00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,970\nwho it's assigned to, ITProTV.web00,\nthat's who I attached it too.\n\n451\n00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,370\nAnd if I go back to my instances,\nthere it is, it's attached.\n\n452\n00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,969\nThat's the IP address of the server and\nif I shut that instance down.\n\n453\n00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:42,400\nEven though it's shut down,\nit's gonna keep that IP.\n\n454\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,071\nIt's gonna keep it, and now I'm gonna have\nit forever until I choose to release it.\n\n455\n00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,610\nAnd that $0.25 cents a day thing,\n\n456\n00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,070\nwho's going to shut the server down for\nan entire day?\n\n457\n00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,740\nNobody gonna do that, so it's really\nnot something you're gonna incur.\n\n458\n00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,458\nSo having a static IP like this is\ntypically good idea for a server.\n\n459\n00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,100\n>> Yeah, very good idea.\n\n460\n00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,170\nNow if you had our own IPd would we\nbe able to sign those as well or\n\n461\n00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,980\ndo you just want to stick\nwith the elastic IP address?\n\n462\n00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,490\n>> Yeah, if it's an internal VM,\n\n463\n00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,600\nif it's one that's on a VPC that's\nprivate, not exposed to the Internet,\n\n464\n00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,800\nyou can actually control those IPs,\nthe subnets that they're in and so on.\n\n465\n00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,020\nBut if it's a public IP,\nAmazon doesn't let you bring your own IPs.\n\n466\n00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,810\nYou have to use theirs, and\n\n467\n00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,855\nthe reason is, remember what you pay for\nwith Amazon right.\n\n468\n00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:28,710\nYou're not just paying for them to host\nan instance for you, you're paying for\n\n469\n00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,590\nthem to give you redundant network\ninfrastructure, redundant bandwidth,\n\n470\n00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,710\nmultiple availability zones, and\nall that stuff, and the way they do that\n\n471\n00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,910\nis by creating redundancy for the IP\naddress pools that they've got right.\n\n472\n00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,400\nThese are,\nwe don't see this on the front end, but\n\n473\n00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,960\non the back end there's what's called\na BGP autonomous system, AS number.\n\n474\n00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,840\nEvery IP address in the Internet attached\nautonomous system number somewhere and\n\n475\n00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,610\nthe redundancy is all\nhandled by that protocol.\n\n476\n00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,570\nWell, if I just rattled\nall that stuff out and\n\n477\n00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,820\nyou were like,\nholy crap what is any of that mean?\n\n478\n00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,185\nWell, fortunately you don't have to\nworry about what any of that means,\n\n479\n00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:04,220\ncuz that's what Amazon's taken\ncare of when you use their IP.\n\n480\n00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,420\nIf you brought your own to be\na whole separate [INAUDIBLE].\n\n481\n00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,610\n>> Yeah, that's a very nice\nservice they provide for\n\n482\n00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,790\nyou they're making life whole lot easier.\n\n483\n00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,880\nNow speaking about making life easier,\n\n484\n00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,930\nsometimes you do need to have\na load balancer in place so\n\n485\n00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,520\nyou have multiple servers trying\nto take care of some traffic and\n\n486\n00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,330\nthen have a load balancer divvying\nout the actual traffic going into.\n\n487\n00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,990\n>> Yeah, I mentioned that earlier that\nyou don't necessarily need static IPs if\n\n488\n00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,993\nyou're using load balancers cuz\npeople hit the load balancer.\n\n489\n00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,750\nAnd the load balancer has\na DNS name that you map to.\n\n490\n00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,254\nYou do like a c name in that\npoints to it instead of an IP, so\n\n491\n00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:38,840\nyou don't have to worry about static\nIPs when you use load balancers\n\n492\n00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,950\n>> Load balancers is really easy to\n\n493\n00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,270\ncreate, there's a couple of options\nyou need to be aware of and\n\n494\n00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,800\nthis would be another thing that we set\nup we start to spin up our new instances.\n\n495\n00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,115\nSo, if you want to create a load balancer\nright here in our console we just go\n\n496\n00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:55,172\ndown to our network in security\nsection and we go into load balancers.\n\n497\n00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,002\nAnd here under load balancers\nyou can spin some up and\n\n498\n00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,551\nyou can see I've already got one\ncreated and I'm gonna create a new one.\n\n499\n00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:05,431\nAnd so maybe I've got some kind of data\nfarm or something that I want to have.\n\n500\n00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:06,491\nLoad balance systems for.\n\n501\n00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:07,811\nMaybe it's a file server, right?\n\n502\n00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:11,291\nSo this might be like,\nitprotv-demofileserver.\n\n503\n00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,770\nWe'll just call it demofile.\n\n504\n00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,345\nAnd we pick some basic options\nhere to specify how we're\n\n505\n00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,840\ngonna be load balancing things.\n\n506\n00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,060\nNow, the main things I need to choose is\nwho the load balancer is going to service.\n\n507\n00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,030\nIf you only have one VPC,\nit's gonna pick that default one, and\n\n508\n00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,660\nthat's exposed to the Internet.\n\n509\n00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,460\nBut you might need\nan internal load balancer,\n\n510\n00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,270\na load balancer that balancing things\nbetween two of your own private networks.\n\n511\n00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,050\nAnd so, if you've already\ncreated that VPC structure,\n\n512\n00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,720\nyou'd be able to choose it right here for\nwhere that load balancer resides.\n\n513\n00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,920\nThe default though is that it's\ngonna be attached to your subnet,\n\n514\n00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,910\nthat's exposed to the Internet.\n\n515\n00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,970\nIf it is internal,\nI would choose that option right here.\n\n516\n00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,340\nI'll make an internal one and\n\n517\n00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,950\nthat's what's gonna be servicing\njust your own systems, all right?\n\n518\n00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,050\nNext we can do advanced\nVPC configurations.\n\n519\n00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,550\nThis is important if you're\ntrying to load balance across\n\n520\n00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,310\nmore than one availability zone.\n\n521\n00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,010\nSo if all your instances are in one zone,\nyou don't really need this.\n\n522\n00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,950\nBut if you've got instances in more than\none zone, you can come down here and\n\n523\n00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,210\nspecify the subnet.\n\n524\n00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,280\nSee how I've got got us-east-1a,\n1c, 1d, 1e?\n\n525\n00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,010\nThose are the availability zones in\nthe Virginia data center that I've chosen.\n\n526\n00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,480\nAnd none of them are chosen right now.\n\n527\n00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,750\nI need to hit plus to add those in, and\nI'm picking which zones I wanna cover.\n\n528\n00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,970\nAnd you can always change this later on.\n\n529\n00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,800\nAmazon recommends a minimum of two.\n\n530\n00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280\nBut you might want to go to three or four.\n\n531\n00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,110\nYou can always modify that after the fact.\n\n532\n00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,380\nThen the most important part\nis the listener configuration.\n\n533\n00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,690\nThe load balancer is listening for\ntraffic to come in and\n\n534\n00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,310\ndistributing it out to\nthe servers on the back end.\n\n535\n00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,250\nI've got a little diagram that shows that.\n\n536\n00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,130\nWhere is my diagram, right here.\n\n537\n00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,662\nSo, we have traffic\ncoming from the Internet.\n\n538\n00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:46,930\nIt's gonna hit the load balancer, and\n\n539\n00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,390\nthe load balancer is gonna send\nit to the back end machines.\n\n540\n00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,580\nWell the load balancer needs to\nknow what traffic to expect.\n\n541\n00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,680\nIf it's a web server, HTTP, HTTPS.\n\n542\n00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,210\nBut it could be something else.\n\n543\n00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,410\nIf it's a file server, maybe it's FTP.\n\n544\n00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,150\nSo, I need to let the listener\nknow what traffic's gonna come in,\n\n545\n00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,319\nso that it can redirect it to\nthe appropriate destination.\n\n546\n00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,700\nSo if I jump back over my configuration,\nit's defaulting to HTTP, and\n\n547\n00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,280\nmaybe I've got that kind\nof file services set up.\n\n548\n00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,030\nI could add more things in here.\n\n549\n00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,590\nBe careful with some, like HTTPS, because\nwith HTTPS the secure connection is gonna\n\n550\n00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,050\nterminate on the load balancer, and not\nterminate on the end stations behind it.\n\n551\n00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,370\nThat can cause some problems sometimes.\n\n552\n00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,170\nSo there might be some advanced\nconfiguration that we have to do.\n\n553\n00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:34,250\nSee how the listener is on HTTPS but\nthe instance protocol is HTTP.\n\n554\n00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,935\nRight?\n\n555\n00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:39,015\nSo if I'm going to do that,\nwhere an SSL connection terminates\n\n556\n00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,165\non the load balancer, I've got to attach\nmy certificate to the load balancer.\n\n557\n00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,185\nAnd Amazon has some great documentation\non that, but you basically need to import\n\n558\n00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:47,085\nyour certificate into their server so\nthat they have it.\n\n559\n00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,615\nIf I wanna add more though,\nI can come in here and I can add, and\n\n560\n00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,555\nI'll punch in somebody else.\n\n561\n00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:56,143\nAnd if I'm doing FTP,\nI'll say like, TCP port 21,\n\n562\n00:26:56,143 --> 00:27:00,838\nand it's going to basically stay\nTCP port 21 on the back end, right?\n\n563\n00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:04,025\nSo looking for traffic on TCP port 21,\n\n564\n00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:07,438\nredirect that to the nodes\non the back end.\n\n565\n00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:09,945\nAll right.\n\n566\n00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:13,670\nThen, it's getting a little bit mad at me,\nhere.\n\n567\n00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,470\nSo, they're not letting\nme load balance FTP.\n\n568\n00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,350\nYou see the limited ports, here?\n\n569\n00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,850\nIf we look at these ports, you've got\nthings like 25, which is SMTP for\n\n570\n00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,130\na mail server.\n\n571\n00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,620\nYou got 80 for web, 443 for secure web.\n\n572\n00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:31,067\n465 which is, that is, what is 465?\n\n573\n00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,037\nIMAP?\n\n574\n00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:33,157\n>> I am not recalling.\n\n575\n00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:36,120\n>> I wanna say that's IMAP and\n587 is secure IMAP.\n\n576\n00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,875\nBut then they've got all\nthese dynamic ports.\n\n577\n00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:42,860\n1,024 all the way to 65,535,\nthose are the non-registered ports, and so\n\n578\n00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,930\nI can come in and I could punch those in.\n\n579\n00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,880\nAnd you can redirect\nthose however you need.\n\n580\n00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,460\nSo it's just telling me that\nthis is not a supported one.\n\n581\n00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,510\nSo there not gonna let\nme load balance FTP.\n\n582\n00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,150\nThere is a little bit of logic that\nhas to be done on Amazon's side so\n\n583\n00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,290\nthey can anticipate what this traffic\nbehavior's gonna be like, and\n\n584\n00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,360\napparently I'm picking\na protocol that's not supported.\n\n585\n00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,710\nWe'll just stick with HTTP for this one.\n\n586\n00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,190\nAll right, then it's gonna\nask who I'm gonna send it to.\n\n587\n00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,600\nWell, wait, no it's not.\n\n588\n00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,440\nNext it's gonna ask me the security group,\nright?\n\n589\n00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,770\nWhat traffic is allowed to get in.\n\n590\n00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,640\nThis is like the software firewall.\n\n591\n00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,540\nThis is normally gonna\nmatch your listeners.\n\n592\n00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,820\nThe traffic you listen on,\nthat's what you want to allow through.\n\n593\n00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,960\nAnd so you'd need to specify that, and\nI'll just reuse the one I've already\n\n594\n00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,540\ngot for web, but you could create\nan all new one and specify those ports.\n\n595\n00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,820\nAll right, now because I chose SSL,\n\n596\n00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,760\nhere it's asking me to\nupload my SSL certificate.\n\n597\n00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,230\nI've gotta upload it because they're\ngonna terminate the encryption\n\n598\n00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,440\non the load balancer and\nnot on the end units.\n\n599\n00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,480\nThe end units won't even see\nthe encryption which is kind of nice,\n\n600\n00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,780\ntakes a load off of them and\nshifts the load over to Amazon.\n\n601\n00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,630\nSo I'd need to provide that\ncertificate information right here.\n\n602\n00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,540\nNow if I have it already uploaded for\nsomething else,\n\n603\n00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,810\nI'd be able to choose that.\n\n604\n00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,530\nI don't have one.\n\n605\n00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,380\nSo I'm actually gonna back\nup just a little bit,\n\n606\n00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,123\nand I'm gonna remove HTTPS from this list,\njust to keep it simple.\n\n607\n00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,910\nAll right, so now you're gonna see it\ndoesn't ask about the certificate, so\n\n608\n00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,920\nI just move right past that.\n\n609\n00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,460\nNow a health check.\n\n610\n00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,750\nWhen you have a load balancer, you've got\none or more servers behind it, right?\n\n611\n00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,820\nAnd if one of those servers were to fail,\n\n612\n00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,810\nyou don't want to keep\nsending traffic to it, right?\n\n613\n00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,100\nGoing back to my diagram,\nwe'll say this server right here failed.\n\n614\n00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,200\nWell, I don't want to keep sending traffic\nto a server that's dead in the water, so\n\n615\n00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,960\nwe can configure a basic health\ncheck to say, look at the server and\n\n616\n00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,240\nsee if it's working.\n\n617\n00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800\nAnd if it is, keep sending traffic to it.\n\n618\n00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800\nBut if it isn't, take it out of the pool.\n\n619\n00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,870\nDon't send traffic to it anymore.\n\n620\n00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,050\nNow, the default health check is HTTP,\nHTTPS, and SSL.\n\n621\n00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,240\nYou can also do TCP, right?\n\n622\n00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,120\nWhich means you can check on any port.\n\n623\n00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,390\nBut when you do this, like TCP port 21,\nit just sees that it connects.\n\n624\n00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,100\nIt doesn't actually see if it works.\n\n625\n00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,722\nSo maybe that's like a MySQL\nserver on the back end.\n\n626\n00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:51,570\nSo it'll verify that the server\nis able to be connected to, but\n\n627\n00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,710\nit won't make sure that it actually\nis able to respond to a query.\n\n628\n00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,960\nSo it is somewhat limited\nwith the health check here.\n\n629\n00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,380\nFortunately I did HTTP,\nso it's easy enough.\n\n630\n00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,810\nYou can specify a page for it to request.\n\n631\n00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,190\nAnd a port number, all right?\n\n632\n00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,540\nYou can also set your intervals down here.\n\n633\n00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,500\nWhen it's doing a health check,\nhow often do you want it to check, and\n\n634\n00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,471\nhow long do you want it to\nwait before it responds?\n\n635\n00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:15,490\nYou can see my response\ntimeout is five seconds.\n\n636\n00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,660\nSo I'm gonna send a request and\nI expect a response within five seconds.\n\n637\n00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,034\nIf I don't get a response in five seconds,\nI'll assume that node's down.\n\n638\n00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:26,050\nI'm gonna check it every thirty seconds.\n\n639\n00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,250\nSo twice a minute I'm a little server and\n\n640\n00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,990\nI expect to get a response\nwithin five seconds.\n\n641\n00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,930\nIf I get two failures in a row,\nthen I'll assume the node is down.\n\n642\n00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,030\nAnd I won't bring the node back up\nuntil it passes ten consecutive checks.\n\n643\n00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,350\nSo, two failures, checking every\nthirty seconds, that's one minute.\n\n644\n00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,830\nIf the server goes down for\na minute I'll take it out of the pool.\n\n645\n00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,230\nBut the server will have to be up for five\nminutes before I put it back in the pool.\n\n646\n00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,850\nThat's the guaranteed stability, right?\n\n647\n00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,859\nYou don't want that server just\ncoming up and then disappearing.\n\n648\n00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,120\nYou can tweak all these numbers\nto be appropriate for you.\n\n649\n00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,940\nMaybe 30 seconds is too long.\n\n650\n00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,270\nMaybe you wanna go ten seconds and\nset your own healthy threshold of three.\n\n651\n00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,840\nSo now if 3 ten-second checks fail\nthat's 30 seconds before we respond.\n\n652\n00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,200\nIt just kind of speeds up\nthat response time, and\n\n653\n00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,050\nthen you can set what that healthy\nthreshold is to whatever you want.\n\n654\n00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,210\nNow, we tell who's going to\nbe in this load balancer.\n\n655\n00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,550\nThat's what I said a minute ago.\n\n656\n00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,665\nSo.\n>> You just love this part.\n\n657\n00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'm kinda used to doing this\n\n658\n00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,320\nwith an auto scaling group,\nwhich if you haven't checked it out,\n\n659\n00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,560\nour auto scaling group is how we\ncan dynamically add servers that\n\n660\n00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,380\ncreate new instances on the fly.\n\n661\n00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,180\nBecause with that it automatically\nadds in the load balancer, and\n\n662\n00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180\nI don't have to go and specify this.\n\n663\n00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,480\nBut we're doing a manual load balancer,\n\n664\n00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,550\nwe do, we just have to check\noff the servers that we want.\n\n665\n00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,060\nSo I'll come in here and I'll say,\nI want this guy and this guy.\n\n666\n00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,880\nI'll pick these two servers.\n\n667\n00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,100\nNow one of them is already down.\n\n668\n00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,720\nSo it's gonna fail the health check,\nbut the other guy should be happy.\n\n669\n00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,620\nAnd so I hit next.\n\n670\n00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,740\nI can assign any tags I want,\nand then I'm done.\n\n671\n00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,120\nRight?\nWe can go in and\n\n672\n00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,530\nreview our changes, and create that pool.\n\n673\n00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,980\nSo now it's gonna create\nthe load balancer.\n\n674\n00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,570\nIt's got two servers in it.\n\n675\n00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,600\nAnd any connections coming in that load\nbalancer are gonna get distributed across\n\n676\n00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,229\nthose two nodes, and we're in business.\n\n677\n00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,140\nNow technically,\nthe load balancer is done.\n\n678\n00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:20,100\nAny traffic sent to the itprotv-demofile\nload balancer is gonna be distributed\n\n679\n00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,430\nacross the servers that are in it, and\nI've got two instances right there.\n\n680\n00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,090\nBut there's usually one\nmore thing we have to do.\n\n681\n00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,990\nThis load balancer has a name, a DNS name.\n\n682\n00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,090\nAnd here's my DNS name, right?\n\n683\n00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,840\nSo if I were to give that to my customers,\noh you want to browse through our website?\n\n684\n00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040\nHere's the address right here.\n\n685\n00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,215\nJust browse through that.\n\n686\n00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:39,605\nIt rolls right off the tongue, right?\n\n687\n00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:40,947\n>> I've got it memorized.\n\n688\n00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:44,485\n[LAUGH]\n>> itprotv-demofile-whatever.\n\n689\n00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,715\nThe server must not be up yet.\n\n690\n00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,025\nSo we provide that, and you can get to it.\n\n691\n00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:52,095\nWell, that's not really a name\nwe want to give out to people.\n\n692\n00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,580\nSo what you're normally going\nto do is go to your DNS zone.\n\n693\n00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,180\nRight?\n\n694\n00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,000\nAnd you'll create what's called a CNAME,\nor\n\n695\n00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,610\na Canonical Name Record,\nthat says file.itpro.tv, or\n\n696\n00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,470\nwhatever name it is that you want,\nfile.donshouse.com.\n\n697\n00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,659\nAnd you'll point that CNAME at\nthis nice big long name here.\n\n698\n00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,320\nAnd that's how it's gonna know to\nredirect your name to this load balancer.\n\n699\n00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,700\nAnd because it's a C name,\nyour end users won't see it.\n\n700\n00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,880\nYour end users will see what they type.\n\n701\n00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,150\nThey'll see file.itpro.tv.\n\n702\n00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,140\nAnd that'll point over to it.\n\n703\n00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,520\nSo, if you're using\nAmazon's Route 53 service for\n\n704\n00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,490\nDNS, check out our Route 53 episode.\n\n705\n00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,350\nWe'll show how to do that,\nhow to create those CNAMES.\n\n706\n00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,880\nIf you're using your own provider though,\nlike Go Daddy, or Hover, Register.com,\n\n707\n00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,530\nany of those guys, then you'll\nhave to go to that provider and\n\n708\n00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,638\ncreate a scene in record there.\n\n709\n00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:43,250\nAnd they all do it a little different, so\nyou might have to contact their support.\n\n710\n00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,370\nBut otherwise, that's basically\na load balancer and it's in place.\n\n711\n00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,260\nSo, those were three additional steps\nthat we take on instances that we create\n\n712\n00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,910\nsnapshots for backup, Static IPs, so that\nwe always know where that nodes gonna be,\n\n713\n00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,060\nand then load balancing to distribute\ntraffic across more than one node.\n\n714\n00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,190\n>> Very awesome stuff, Don.\n\n715\n00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,750\nReally good.\n\n716\n00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,290\nI hope you guys out there\nhave learned a lot from this.\n\n717\n00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,580\nI know I sure have.\n\n718\n00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,490\nSo, have we missed anything?\n\n719\n00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,640\nWe got any other thing to cover?\n\n720\n00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,310\n>> I think that's it.\n\n721\n00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,090\n>> All right, well that being said,\nI guess that's all we have for\n\n722\n00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,280\nthis episode by ITProTV.\n\n723\n00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,140\nSigning off.\n\n724\n00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,680\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n725\n00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,350\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n726\n00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,595\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n727\n00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:25,219\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,430\nI'll be your host today, Daniel Lowrie,\nand here with me today is Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,350\nHow you doing today Don?\n\n5\n00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,170\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n6\n00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,260\nToday, Daniel, we're gonna be\njumping into the world of Amazon S3\n\n7\n00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,170\nwhich is their hosted storage solution.\n\n8\n00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,120\nAnd really we're gonna talk a little\nbit about hosted storage in general.\n\n9\n00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,398\nBut it's a great technology.\n\n10\n00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,810\nI call it the gateway technology into\n\n11\n00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,630\nAWS cuz it's where a lot\nof people get started.\n\n12\n00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,129\nIt's one of the easier ones to deploy and\nit's super efficient so\n\n13\n00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,319\nit's a great one to work with.\n\n14\n00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,790\nNothing like saying, hey I got some data.\n\n16\n00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,515\nWon't you hold this for me?\n\n17\n00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:49,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> So a lot of companies are faced with\n\n18\n00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,610\nan issue where they've got some\ndata that they wanna hand out and\n\n19\n00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,330\nthey need a way to\ndistribute that information.\n\n20\n00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,840\nSo if I have, let's say I have a PDF,\nright, just a document.\n\n21\n00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,030\nAnd I wanna distribute\nthat all my viewers.\n\n22\n00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,120\nWell, if I have a server that's connected\nto the Internet I can put the file on\n\n23\n00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,190\nthere and then people could go and\ndownload it.\n\n24\n00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,043\nBut there's two things\nI have to worry about.\n\n25\n00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,620\nOne, maintaining that server.\n\n26\n00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,574\nRight, so somebody could break into\nthat server get my data or whatever.\n\n27\n00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,850\nAnd two, bandwidth.\n\n28\n00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,870\nI've only got so much bandwidth.\n\n29\n00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,690\nBut there's this little old company called\nAmazon, and boy, do they have bandwidth.\n\n30\n00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,410\nThey have tons and tons of bandwidth,\nand the best part is you just pay for\n\n31\n00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,750\nwhat you use.\n\n32\n00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,370\nSo I can put files up in\nAmazon's Web Services.\n\n33\n00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,792\nThey can serve it out to the world and\nI just pay for what I actually use,\n\n34\n00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,699\nusing their infrastructure\nthat's what it's all about.\n\n35\n00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:39,316\nSo, S3 is their primary\nstorage product and\n\n36\n00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:44,268\nwith S3 it's just a scalable\nstorage solution from them that\n\n37\n00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:49,520\nlets you put files up in the cloud and\nthen people can download it.\n\n38\n00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,946\nNow it's a little bit\nmore complex than that.\n\n39\n00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,060\nI mean, at it's basis that's what it is.\n\n40\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,660\nYou go to the files there and\npeople can download.\n\n41\n00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,010\nBut it's got a lot of power,\n\n42\n00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,670\nin that you can control who is allowed to\naccess the files, how they get downloaded.\n\n43\n00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,500\nYou can even host a static\nwebsite out of this thing,\n\n44\n00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,450\nyou can do all sorts of\ncrazy stuff with S3.\n\n45\n00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,410\nSo let's dive into it, take a look at it.\n\n46\n00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,240\nWe'll get a chance to see\nthat technology in action.\n\n47\n00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,700\nAll right so, I'm logged into\nmy web services console here and\n\n48\n00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,880\nright down under storage and content\ndelivery, we'll see S3 right there.\n\n49\n00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,760\nYou can always recognize which\nones are the most popular\n\n50\n00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,850\nproducts from Amazon because they're\nalways the first in their category, right?\n\n51\n00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,330\nSo under Compute, it's EC2.\n\n52\n00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,290\nUnder Database, it's RDS.\n\n53\n00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,990\nUnder Storage Content Delivery, it's S3.\n\n54\n00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,470\nNow, there are several\nother services in here.\n\n55\n00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,830\nLet me just mention those\nbriefly before we dive into S3.\n\n56\n00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,600\nSome of these are kind of datas or\nspecialized,\n\n57\n00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,400\nbut Glacier is another one\nthat's gaining in popularity.\n\n58\n00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,119\nWhen we store our files on S3 it's\nstored on redundant storage, and\n\n59\n00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,772\nthat means if there's a failure at\nAmazon site our data stays safe,\n\n60\n00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:53,538\nit's up, and it's good fast storage too,\nso you'll get great performance out of it.\n\n61\n00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:58,171\nBut maybe you have data that you want to\nstore up in the Amazon that you don't need\n\n62\n00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,332\nfast storage you just need storage.\n\n63\n00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,860\nMaybe putting backups up there, right?\n\n64\n00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,000\nSo, I don't need my backup\nstorage to be fast,\n\n65\n00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,900\ncuz I'm only gonna go to that\nstorage if I have a failure, right?\n\n66\n00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900\nSo you can use Glacier, instead.\n\n67\n00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,900\nIt's not as good of a storage.\n\n68\n00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,020\nAmazon does back it up.\n\n69\n00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,070\nIf there's a failure it may\nactually go offline, but\n\n70\n00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,390\nthey'll bring it back online again.\n\n71\n00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,920\nIt doesn't have the same\nlevel of redundancy.\n\n72\n00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,410\nIt doesn't have the same\nlevel of performance.\n\n73\n00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,580\nAnd the tradeoff for that,\nfor giving up performance and\n\n74\n00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,030\nstability, is that it's a lot cheaper.\n\n75\n00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,960\nSo if you're just looking for\n\n76\n00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,040\nsomething to sit up there and wait\nuntil you need it, you can use Glacier.\n\n77\n00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,610\nIt's a lot less expensive, and\nit's archive storage in the cloud.\n\n78\n00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,590\nAnother option is CloudFront.\n\n79\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,410\nWhen we use S3, we're putting our\nfiles into Amazon's cloud, and\n\n80\n00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,060\nit's going to one of\ntheir availability zones.\n\n81\n00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,140\nSo let's say I pick the US East,\nthe Virginia, data center.\n\n82\n00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,510\nSo my files are there.\n\n83\n00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,840\nWell, for my users that are in\nthe Eastern United States,\n\n84\n00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,920\nthey go to download those files and\nthey get them, it's great, right?\n\n85\n00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,080\nBut if you're in China, Australia,\nSingapore, you're somewhere like that,\n\n86\n00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,530\nyou gotta come all the way over to\nthe Eastern US to download this file, and\n\n87\n00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,290\nit's going to be slower.\n\n88\n00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,080\nThey're gonna have a worse experience.\n\n89\n00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,170\nWell if you only do business within\nthe eastern region of the US,\n\n90\n00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,810\nthen you don't care about that, right?\n\n91\n00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,070\nBut if you're a global\ncompany that's a problem.\n\n92\n00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,610\nWhat CloudFront does is it says if\nyou upload a file into CloudFront,\n\n93\n00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,850\nit will replicate it across Amazon's\ndata centers all over the world.\n\n94\n00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,620\nAnd so if you're in the Eastern US and\nyou go to download that file,\n\n95\n00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,940\nit'll come from the Virginia data, but\n\n96\n00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,890\nif you're in Singapore it'll come\nfrom the East Asian data center.\n\n97\n00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,690\nIt'll come from a data center that's\ngeographically close to you which\n\n98\n00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,980\nmeans you get better\nperformance out of it, right?\n\n99\n00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,520\nSo if we want to distribute\ncontent all over the world and\n\n100\n00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,090\nwe want high performance.\n\n101\n00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,640\nYou normally see this with like,\nvideo streaming.\n\n102\n00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,940\nWell, kind of like what we do here for\nthe show.\n\n103\n00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,540\nYou'll use something like CloudFront.\n\n104\n00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,040\nBut if it's just a PDF to be downloaded,\nand simple file content like that,\n\n105\n00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,290\nthat's where S3 comes in, and that's\nthe one that we're going to look at.\n\n106\n00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,290\nNow when you jump into S3, if this is\nthe first time you've gone into it most of\n\n107\n00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,160\nthis stuff is gonna be empty, there's not\nreally gonna be anything in here, and\n\n108\n00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,280\nit's going to offer to create a bucket.\n\n109\n00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,070\nS3 divides your content up into buckets.\n\n110\n00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,120\nYou can have one bucket, or\nyou can have 50 buckets, so\n\n111\n00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520\nyou can have a whole bunch\nof them if you want.\n\n112\n00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320\nMost people just have one bucket and\nthat's all they need.\n\n113\n00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800\nThe only reason you really have for\n\n114\n00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,340\ncreating more than one\nbucket is permissions.\n\n115\n00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,520\nYou can set different permissions\ndifferent types of access on each bucket,\n\n116\n00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,410\nso from an administrative perspective\nwe might want to divide things up into\n\n117\n00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,340\nthese buckets.\n\n118\n00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,216\nBut if it's just raw content being thrown\nin there you may only have one bucket and\n\n119\n00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:32,844\nthat's it.\n\n120\n00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:35,410\nYou can see I've already\ngot three sitting here for\n\n121\n00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,231\nvarious things like elastic beanstalk and\nsome examples that I whipped up,\n\n122\n00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:42,230\nwhich I don't really need these\nI just get them out of here.\n\n123\n00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,975\nBut you create these buckets and\nyou put them in place and\n\n124\n00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:48,570\nyour able to use those for\nwhatever resource it is that you need.\n\n125\n00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,740\nNow, when you create a bucket it doesn't\nreally ask you a whole lot of questions.\n\n126\n00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,490\nWhen we go to create it it just asks for\na name and a region.\n\n127\n00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,201\nRemember, I mentioned with S3 it comes\nout of one of Amazon's data centers so\n\n128\n00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,150\nwe just need to specify what data center.\n\n129\n00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,270\nSo I'm gonna create a bucket.\n\n130\n00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,890\nI'll call this my ITProTV AWS demo.\n\n131\n00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,680\nAnd this bucket name,\n\n132\n00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,580\nit's gonna become part of the URL\nthat's used to access this file.\n\n133\n00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,500\nAnd that means it needs to be unique.\n\n134\n00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,630\nIt needs to be unique across\nall of Amazon's customers.\n\n135\n00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,570\nSo if I try to call it\nsomething like files, right?\n\n136\n00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,520\nWell, files is a pretty generic name.\n\n137\n00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,470\nI'll bet somebody is already taken it.\n\n138\n00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,960\nIf not, we're about to get\nthe most awesome name ever.\n\n139\n00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,440\nSo we'll give it a shot.\n\n140\n00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,350\nI'm just gonna pick US Standard for\nmy region.\n\n141\n00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,640\nYou'll see where I've got Ireland,\nSingapore, Sydney, Sao Paulo, Frankfurt.\n\n142\n00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,970\nAll these other different regions.\n\n143\n00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,630\nI'm going to go with US Standard.\n\n144\n00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,880\nAll right, when I go to hit Create.\n\n145\n00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,780\nThere we go.\n\n146\n00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,250\nI figured files had to be\ngeneric enough to red flag and\n\n147\n00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,600\nsure enough it's already in use.\n\n148\n00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,551\nNow if we appended something to\nit like I see itprotv-files.\n\n149\n00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:53,400\nWell, I doubt anybody's already made that,\nbut they might have, right?\n\n150\n00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,440\nSomebody might have made that.\n\n151\n00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,210\nI'll stick with it.\n\n152\n00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,010\nI'll go ahead and create it.\n\n153\n00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,150\nThere we go now I've got\na bucket called itprotv-files.\n\n154\n00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,620\nNow, a bucket, like its name implies,\nis a container.\n\n155\n00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,010\nAnd it's not very useful until\nwe start to stick data in there.\n\n156\n00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,410\nSo, I need to throw some files and\n\n157\n00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,040\ncontent into that bucket before\nit's gonna be of any use to me.\n\n158\n00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,290\nWell, when you click on the bucket,\nit takes you in there.\n\n159\n00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,120\nAnd I can see that it's currently empty.\n\n160\n00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,270\nAnd I can upload files into it and\n\n161\n00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,870\nnow they'll be available for people to\naccess, right, at its most basic level.\n\n162\n00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,510\nSo if I go in here and I hit my little\nupload button, I can then add files and\n\n163\n00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,480\nI could use a little drag and drop.\n\n164\n00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,742\nI'll take a PDF file here and\nI'll throw it in.\n\n165\n00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:41,314\nAnd so there's that topology,\nthat PDF, and I'll go ahead and\n\n166\n00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:44,092\njust hit Start Upload and\nit's gonna upload it and\n\n167\n00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:47,340\nnow I'll have my first file stored in S3,\nright.\n\n168\n00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,801\nSo getting the bucket created and\ngetting files put in there, super simple.\n\n169\n00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:55,105\nWell, we got a 30 minute show and\nwe're only 10 minutes in,\n\n170\n00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:56,310\nwhat do we do about the rest of it?\n\n171\n00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,400\nWell, there's a lot of other options here.\n\n172\n00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,731\nAll right, so some of the neat\nthings that we can do with S3.\n\n173\n00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:06,700\nFirst off just throwing a file in\nthere like that, that's a good start.\n\n174\n00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,470\nOne of the things we have to remember\nthough is that there are properties\n\n175\n00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,200\nattached to the bucket and\nproperties attached to the file.\n\n176\n00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,490\nAnd mostly we deal with those properties\nin terms of setting permissions,\n\n177\n00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,110\nwho is allowed to access this information.\n\n178\n00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,532\nIf I go back to all buckets,\nI'll see my bucket list here.\n\n179\n00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:26,450\nAnd if where you click on the screen\nis a little bit interesting here.\n\n180\n00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,430\nIf I click on the name of a bucket,\nit's a hyperlink and\n\n181\n00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,700\nit takes me inside that bucket.\n\n182\n00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,550\nAll right?\n\n183\n00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,160\nBut if I click near the bucket\nit highlights it, and\n\n184\n00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,220\nsee how I'm highlighting these buckets.\n\n185\n00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,800\nWell that's what's changing,\n\n186\n00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,340\nwhat's happening over here on\nthe right side of the screen.\n\n187\n00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,810\nThe right side of the screen is this\nlittle properties pane or transfers pane.\n\n188\n00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,290\nThe transfers pane is showing all\nthe files that I'm uploading what their\n\n189\n00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,060\nstatus is.\n\n190\n00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,520\nBut the properties pane that's\nshowing the settings for\n\n191\n00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,380\nwhatever bucket I just clicked over here.\n\n192\n00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,020\nSo here I am looking at\nmy example properties or\n\n193\n00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,910\nhere I'm looking at ITProTV files.\n\n194\n00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,770\nSo clicking near the bucket gets us there,\nit's a little bit weird to get used to.\n\n195\n00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,820\nBut once we're in there,\n\n196\n00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,230\nyou'll see all the different things\nthat we can set including permissions.\n\n197\n00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,800\nAnd the permissions can be very simple or\nthey can be very complex, right?\n\n198\n00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,240\nOn a simple level, you'll see here\nwhere I've got this grantee, awsdemo.\n\n199\n00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,030\nThat's my account and I'm logged in with\nand I've got permission to list, upload,\n\n200\n00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,670\nview permissions.\n\n201\n00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,220\nI can do whatever I want, all right.\n\n202\n00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,200\nBut what if I want other people\nto be able to get into here?\n\n203\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,100\nWell I can hit Add more permissions and\nI can start to stack that on.\n\n204\n00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900\nSo I can come in here and for\nthe grantee, I can pick other\n\n205\n00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,020\nusers that might be attached to my\naccount or I can pick Everyone.\n\n206\n00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,350\nMaybe I want everybody on the Internet\nto be able to download these files.\n\n207\n00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,450\nSo I can come in here and\nI can give them list permissions,\n\n208\n00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,470\nto list the files that are in this bucket.\n\n209\n00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,970\nAnd then I'll need to give them\npermission to the file itself.\n\n210\n00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,740\nI don't want them to upload or\ndelete, so I'm not gonna do that.\n\n211\n00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,020\nAnd I probably don't want them\nto view permissions either so\n\n212\n00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,550\nI'm not gonna do that one.\n\n213\n00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,410\nWe'll just start with giving\nthem those list permissions.\n\n214\n00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,610\nThis other box that's kinda trailing here,\nit actually wraps around Edit Permissions.\n\n215\n00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,580\nIf I make this wider there,\nthat'll fix that.\n\n216\n00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,030\nSo we can see\nEdit Permissions right there.\n\n217\n00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,770\nI definitely don't wanna\ngive them that either.\n\n218\n00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,481\nBut I'll give them the ability\nto list what's in the bucket.\n\n219\n00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,630\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,210\nSome of the other settings that we\nsee here on the bucket are things\n\n221\n00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,520\nlike logging.\n\n222\n00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,930\nLogging, if I want to keep track\nof who's downloading files,\n\n223\n00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,580\nwho's accessing these resources,\nI can turn on that logging and\n\n224\n00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,720\nthe logs can get stored to another bucket,\nright.\n\n225\n00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,940\nSo if I have a different bucket that's\nout there I can store on there.\n\n226\n00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,050\nAnd that's cuz the logs can\nactually grow pretty big,\n\n227\n00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,110\nand you need some place to store them so\nyou just put another S3 bucket.\n\n228\n00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,850\nWe can do events where we\ncan have it text us or\n\n229\n00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,240\nother things when certain events happened.\n\n230\n00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,290\nLambda functions get called or whatever.\n\n231\n00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,070\nSo you can define neat\nnotifications there.\n\n232\n00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,050\nWe also have versioning.\n\n233\n00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,800\nIf you're gonna be updating these\nfiles right, a new version of\n\n234\n00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,220\nthis PDF comes out so I put it,\nI might wanna keep previous versions.\n\n235\n00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,030\nAnd so we can turn that on, and\n\n236\n00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,150\nevery time a file changes,\nit'll preserve the old version too.\n\n237\n00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,230\nNow, that does increase your storage and\nyou pay for that right.\n\n238\n00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,570\nWith S3 you actually billed on two things.\n\n239\n00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,780\nYou're billed a certain rate for just the\namount of data you have sitting in there.\n\n240\n00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,230\nSo if I put 10 gigs of data in the bucket.\n\n241\n00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,880\nI get billed for that every month for\n\n242\n00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,530\nstoring 10 gigs of data it's a real\nsmall amount S3 is really affordable.\n\n243\n00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,240\nThen when I upload data,\nI don't get charged for that.\n\n244\n00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,860\nBut when people download my data,\nyou do get charged for that.\n\n245\n00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,170\nYou're charged bandwidth for downloads.\n\n246\n00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,690\nSo the data itself, sitting there in\nthe bucket whether people download it or\n\n247\n00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,810\nnot, you bill for that.\n\n248\n00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,750\nAnd then when people download,\nyou get billed.\n\n249\n00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,400\nWhen you do this versioning.\n\n250\n00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,570\nYou're paying storage prices for\nthe previous versions.\n\n251\n00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,270\nYou're not really paying download, cuz\nnobody downloads the previous versions.\n\n252\n00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,600\nThey just sit there and\nmaybe you get them.\n\n253\n00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,430\n>> So this works works a lot like Shadow\nProtector, Shadow Copy or Time Machine.\n\n254\n00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,860\n>> Yeah, Time Machine on the Mac,\n\n255\n00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,750\nVolume Shadow Copy on Windows or\nWindows has a couple names for it.\n\n256\n00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> VSS or whatever.\n\n257\n00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,607\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, same basic concept but\n\n258\n00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:02,686\non your S3 bucket.\n\n259\n00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:03,410\n>> Awesome.\n\n260\n00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,950\n>> Yeah,\nreally useful if you change files a lot.\n\n261\n00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,080\nSome of these other things are a little\nmore advanced than what I want to get into\n\n262\n00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,070\nhere on the show, but\nthe things like Cross Region Replication.\n\n263\n00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,470\nIf we want to set up replication between\nregions so that if one region goes down,\n\n264\n00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,810\nour files will be available\nsomewhere else, we've got that.\n\n265\n00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,280\nNow, I'll tell you this feature gets used\nless and less, thanks to CloudFront.\n\n266\n00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,950\nIf you really want to have\nyour files distributed,\n\n267\n00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,070\nyou can use CloudFront to do it.\n\n268\n00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,200\nBut this feature's still here and\n\n269\n00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,540\nthere are some cases where\nyou might want to use that.\n\n270\n00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,230\nAll right.\n\n271\n00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,820\nAnd there's actually a neat option\nway down here at the bottom.\n\n272\n00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,440\nRequester pays.\n\n273\n00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,270\nYou can actually set it up where\nin order for somebody to download,\n\n274\n00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,970\nthey have to have an Amazon account and\nthey pay for the bandwidth.\n\n275\n00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,250\nThat's good if you're like\na contracting company,\n\n276\n00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,170\nyou're providing services\nout to a customer and\n\n277\n00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,590\nyou want them to incur the cost of\nthe bandwidth, you can set that up.\n\n278\n00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,391\nSo a couple of neat different\nthings that we can define here.\n\n279\n00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:57,940\nNow, the permissions that we saw,\nthat was right here on the bucket itself.\n\n280\n00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,550\nBut we also have properties and\npermissions on the files inside of it.\n\n281\n00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,270\nSo if I let me just make\nsure I save my changes here.\n\n282\n00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,400\nOn each of these screens you've\ngot a little save button, so\n\n283\n00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,210\nyou might need to hit that just to\nmake sure you save your settings.\n\n284\n00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,970\nIf I go into ITProTV files and\nI choose that topology file I uploaded.\n\n285\n00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,210\nI can go into Properties and\nhere's the properties for the file itself.\n\n286\n00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,860\nAnd you can see like details,\n\n287\n00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,910\nbasic information about it, whether it's\nstandard or reduced redundancy storage.\n\n288\n00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,390\nReduced redundancy storage means that\nAmazon's only gonna maintain one copy of\n\n289\n00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,090\nthis file and if that storage fails,\nthey lose their copy.\n\n290\n00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,941\nWell, you save money by doing that.\n\n291\n00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,562\nAnd if it's not critical, if you've got\na copy, you can just upload again and\n\n292\n00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:38,470\nthat's fine.\n\n293\n00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,620\nBut otherwise,\nwe have standard redundancy and\n\n294\n00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,630\nthat means Amazon makes sure that\nit's laying at least on a RAID array.\n\n295\n00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,170\nSo if a drive fails,\nit still survives the failure.\n\n296\n00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,800\nAnd you can set server site encryption.\n\n297\n00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,690\nIf we wanna bump it up and\ndo AES256, you can.\n\n298\n00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,399\nThat's if you're worried about your data\nbeing exposed to other Amazon customers.\n\n299\n00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,760\nNow, when a user goes to download\nthe data, it's decrypted there.\n\n300\n00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,800\nSo it's really only encrypted when\nit's at rest on Amazon's servers.\n\n301\n00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,710\nBut more importantly,\nwe've got our permissions right here.\n\n302\n00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,230\nAnd you'll see awsdemo has Open/Download,\nView Permissions, and Edit Permissions.\n\n303\n00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,130\nIf I want everybody in the world\nto be able to download this file,\n\n304\n00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,280\nI need to come in here and add that.\n\n305\n00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,580\nAnd I'll say that everyone has open and\ndownload permissions.\n\n306\n00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,560\nI don't want to give them view\npermissions or edit permissions,\n\n307\n00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,681\nI just want them to open and\ndownload, right?\n\n308\n00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,180\nThat's what you normally want to do\nwhen you make something available.\n\n309\n00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,630\nI could list a specific AWS account if\nI had other users on my account, but\n\n310\n00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,360\nI'm just gonna do everyone\n>> Now Don,\n\n311\n00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360\nhow would a user actually\naccess this content?\n\n312\n00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,400\n>> All right, so\neach file has its own URL and\n\n313\n00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240\nit's all built off of the bucket right?\n\n314\n00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,956\nIf I go back to my bucket and\nI take ITProTV files and\n\n315\n00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,446\nI go in here into its properties.\n\n316\n00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:50,450\nIt just says ITProTV files and that's it.\n\n317\n00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,690\nBut that name is becoming\npart of a longer URL that\n\n318\n00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,960\nwill let people access my files and\nthey don't really show it here.\n\n319\n00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,220\nBut if I drive down into\nthe file like this topology PDF,\n\n320\n00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,060\nthen I go to its properties,\nthey give me the full URL right here.\n\n321\n00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,071\nAnd see how it's s3.amazonaws.com, right?\n\n322\n00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:13,100\nSo that's Amazon's domain/ITProTV files.\n\n323\n00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,410\nThat's why it has to be unique\nacross all the customers, right?\n\n324\n00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,565\nEvery Amazon customer's getting\nthat subdirectory/topology.pdf,\n\n325\n00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:20,641\nthat's that URL.\n\n326\n00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:23,657\nIf you're watching the show live,\nyou could type that it right now, and\n\n327\n00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:24,850\nyou'll download that PDF.\n\n328\n00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,010\nEverybody's got permissions to it.\n\n329\n00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,860\nYou can hit it.\n\n330\n00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,160\nIf you're watching this recorded,\nI've probably deleted the file by then.\n\n331\n00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,470\nBut it's just this URL.\n\n332\n00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,630\nThis is what we would\nhand off to our users.\n\n333\n00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,800\nAnd it defaulted to HTTPS, but\nit works for secure and non-secure.\n\n334\n00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,670\nSo if I browse that, there's the PDF file.\n\n335\n00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,920\nRight?\nI can get in and I can view that.\n\n336\n00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,860\nIf I do the same thing and\nknock off that s.\n\n337\n00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,810\nSo I'll go just not secure.\n\n338\n00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,673\nThere we go.\n\n339\n00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,151\nI can jump over and\nthere it is too, right?\n\n340\n00:15:55,151 --> 00:16:00,072\nI don't have to send out as HTTPS,\nif I don't want to.\n\n341\n00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:03,090\nSo those URLs,\nthey're generated right here.\n\n342\n00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,910\nBut if you know your bucket name then\nyou can build the URL in your mind.\n\n343\n00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,810\nIt's just S3.amazonaws.com/ your\nbucket name, slash your file name.\n\n344\n00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,830\nNow when we have a lot\nof files in our system,\n\n345\n00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,930\nyou might want to organize those for\nyour own sake.\n\n346\n00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,250\nAnd normally as a human being we\norganize files, we create folders.\n\n347\n00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,950\nSo I might want sub-folders in my bucket.\n\n348\n00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,650\nAnd you can do that, but on the backend,\nAmazon is actually storing this and\n\n349\n00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,620\nmanaging it like\na database type structure.\n\n350\n00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,850\nAnd so they don't care about folders.\n\n351\n00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,540\nIf I have one file or one million\nfiles in this bucket, it doesn't care.\n\n352\n00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,340\nIt just treats them as all\nbeing in the same directory.\n\n353\n00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,880\nBut we can create folders.\n\n354\n00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,270\nAnd on the back end,\nall it's really doing are tags.\n\n355\n00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,990\nSo, it's basically tagging each file\nto make it look like it's in a folder.\n\n356\n00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,310\nBut when I go into a bucket.\n\n357\n00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,660\nLike, I'm in the ITProTV\nfiles bucket right now.\n\n358\n00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,650\nI can hit Create folder, and maybe I\nwant to create a folder called configs.\n\n359\n00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,630\nSo this PDF has a router\ntopology that I made.\n\n360\n00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,100\nAnd I might want to have\nconfiguration files.\n\n361\n00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,370\nI might want to store those\nin that subdirectory.\n\n362\n00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,070\nSo I can go into the subdirectory,\nand I see it's information right here.\n\n363\n00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,540\nAnd I can go and\nupload files into that directory And\n\n364\n00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,320\njust let me go find some\nthat I can throw in there.\n\n365\n00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,020\nSo here's a bunch of router configs,\nand I'll just take these and\n\n366\n00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,960\nthrow them in there.\n\n367\n00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,570\nI'm gonna upload all those files.\n\n368\n00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,700\nAnd to save me a little bit of time\nI don't want to have to go and\n\n369\n00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,650\nset permissions on each one of these.\n\n370\n00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,040\nSo instead of just hitting start upload,\nwhat I'm going to do is,\n\n371\n00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,320\nI'm gonna go and hit set details.\n\n372\n00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,120\nAnd I don't really care about this stuff.\n\n373\n00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,690\nServer side encryption or whatever.\n\n374\n00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,860\nReduce redundancy I can\nturn these options on.\n\n375\n00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,150\nBut on the next screen I\ncan set permissions and\n\n376\n00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,530\nin here I can choose\nMake everything public.\n\n377\n00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,560\nThat's gonna give everybody\naccess to these files.\n\n378\n00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,060\nIt's gonna do them all in bulk as\nopposed to me having to go in and\n\n379\n00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,590\ndo a file by file.\n\n380\n00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,410\nSo I'll go ahead and\ndo that and I start upload.\n\n381\n00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,220\nAnd now it's gonna upload all those\nright there into that sub folder.\n\n382\n00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,480\nNow When I look at it,\nI see ITProTV files,\n\n383\n00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,790\nI see a folder, and in that folder\nI see all those config files.\n\n384\n00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,770\nBut on Amazon servers, they just\nsee all these files all together.\n\n385\n00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,530\nAnd they,\nsay these files are tagged as configs.\n\n386\n00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,560\nAnd so it's just a tag on their end.\n\n387\n00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,940\nAnd there's no limit to the amount\nof files you can have in one bucket.\n\n388\n00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,990\nSo you can throw as many files\nin there if you want, and\n\n389\n00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,820\nit's gonna do fine with that.\n\n390\n00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,425\nBut now, if somebody wants to download\none of these, I'll just take this guy,\n\n391\n00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,780\nBR1.txt.\n\n392\n00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,815\nIf you look at it URL,\nsee how it's got that /configs?\n\n393\n00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:38,070\n/BR1.txt, and if I pass that URL to\nsomebody, with that subdirectory.\n\n394\n00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,640\nThey can browse to it, and\nthere's that router config.\n\n395\n00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,889\nThey can read it and\ndo whatever they want.\n\n396\n00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,920\nAll right, so getting our data into AWS,\nor getting it into S3, not very hard.\n\n397\n00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,490\nIf you have the AWS command line utilities\ninstalled you can upload that way too.\n\n398\n00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,030\nThat's a great way if you wanna\nsend a ton of data in there.\n\n399\n00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,310\nThere's third party software like\nCloudBerry Explorer, or EpanDrive, or\n\n400\n00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,170\nother programs.\n\n401\n00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,530\nThat can connect up and\nyou can you can sync entire directories,\n\n402\n00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,670\ntons of information at once.\n\n403\n00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,440\nReal ways to do that to\nget that data into S3.\n\n404\n00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,340\nCouple other neat little tricks we can do.\n\n405\n00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,330\nS3 is designed for\nfile storage, put files there.\n\n406\n00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,890\nAnd then people can download and\naccess them.\n\n407\n00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,620\nIf you want to get really advanced with\npermissions you can create what are called\n\n408\n00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,240\nbucket policies.\n\n409\n00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,190\nIf I go back out to my bucket\nsettings when I went to\n\n410\n00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,640\npermissions you guys\nmight have noticed this.\n\n411\n00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,190\nI can add permission or\nI can add on bucket policies.\n\n412\n00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,250\nBucket policies let me\ndictate all sorts of things.\n\n413\n00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,830\nI can say a user is only\nallowed to download this file\n\n414\n00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,290\nif they are coming from this website\nRight, you can set referer policies.\n\n415\n00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,780\nOr they're only allowed to download\nthis file if they're coming from this\n\n416\n00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,720\nIP address.\n\n417\n00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,970\nOr only allowed to download\na certain amount of files at once.\n\n418\n00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,500\nYou can create all sorts of policies and\nrestrictions.\n\n419\n00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,020\nIt's written in a kind of\na specialized language though.\n\n420\n00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,940\nSo Amazon actually has its little policy\ngenerator you can use to help with that.\n\n421\n00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,590\nBut just to show you guys\nlike a sample policy.\n\n422\n00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,650\nYou know, here's one that is\nrestricting access to a specific IP.\n\n423\n00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,620\nAnd so they come through and they define\nwhat they're restricting access to,\n\n424\n00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,260\na particular bucket.\n\n425\n00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,740\nAnd then the IP,\nthe source IP that has to be used.\n\n426\n00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,558\nSo you can define that type of setting and\nget really,\n\n427\n00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,381\nreally advanced with this stuff.\n\n428\n00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:25,545\nOther neat tricks, If you just\nwant to create a simple web page,\n\n429\n00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,070\nthat's a static web page.\n\n430\n00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,010\nNot PHP or ASP or anything like that.\n\n431\n00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,200\nJust a regular HTML web page.\n\n432\n00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,140\nYou can host it right out of S3.\n\n433\n00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,180\nS3 can serve up HTML files, and\nyour machines can render it.\n\n434\n00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,500\nAll you have to do is go into your bucket,\nand upload a file.\n\n435\n00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,390\nSo maybe I want, well here.\n\n436\n00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,720\nWe have to do a couple of things.\n\n437\n00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,400\nNormally what you want to do is\nname the bucket after a website.\n\n438\n00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,160\nSo like I got this one right\nhere example.itprotv.net.\n\n439\n00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,370\nSo that's the name of the website.\n\n440\n00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,850\nAnd if I go into that you'll see\nI've got like a little indexed on\n\n441\n00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,370\nHTML file that I've created.\n\n442\n00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,920\nJust a regular HTML file and\nif I were to try and view that.\n\n443\n00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,970\nBut if I go to its URL,\nsee how it actually renders the HTML?\n\n444\n00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,620\nI don't see the HTML tags.\n\n445\n00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,750\nIt rendered it.\n\n446\n00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,280\nYou can do that,\nyou can host a simple web page.\n\n447\n00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,890\nIt does require a little bucket setting,\nthough.\n\n448\n00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,950\nOn your bucket,\nyou need to choose the bucket.\n\n449\n00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,200\nAnd under your settings over here,\nyou'll see static web hosting.\n\n450\n00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,230\nAnd you can choose to\nenable static web hosting.\n\n451\n00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,810\nAnd all you have to provide it\nthe name of your index document.\n\n452\n00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,250\nThe default document that'll load\nif somebody browses that URL.\n\n453\n00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,910\nAnd now if somebody browses to my example\nbucket, they'll get that web page and\n\n454\n00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,020\nrender on the screen and there you go.\n\n455\n00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,290\nIt's on highly redundant\nservers with tons of bandwidth.\n\n456\n00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,910\nYou can have static web page,\nit's really powerful.\n\n457\n00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,470\nYou need PHP and other things though,\n\n458\n00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,000\nyou're gonna have to set up\nan EC2 instance to go that route.\n\n459\n00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,970\nBut for a simple web page,\nit's a neat resource.\n\n460\n00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,440\n>> Yeah, this would be really, I do for\nmy wife and I, I'll create our home page.\n\n461\n00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,680\nAnd so what I do is I host it\non a free website or whatever.\n\n462\n00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,770\nBut this would be easier, because All it\ndoes is have all our favorite links and\n\n463\n00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,490\nthings like that.\n\n464\n00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,490\nA Google search bar, nothing fantastic.\n\n465\n00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,230\nBut then I would be able to say that the\nURL to them and be that much easier cuz\n\n466\n00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,620\na lot of those free website stuff\nis a little difficult to work with.\n\n467\n00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n468\n00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,670\nHere, just remember that they don't\ngive you a ton of support as far as any\n\n469\n00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,740\nadvanced features.\n\n470\n00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,810\nBut you can host your images, your files,\nyou can throw it all up in there.\n\n471\n00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,400\nOne big negative, no real SSL support.\n\n472\n00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,540\nSo if you want to use SSL,\nyou've got this nice big long name.\n\n473\n00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,370\nAnd if you use their end point name,\nyou can use their SSL.\n\n474\n00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,910\nBut if you're doing like a DNSC name,\n\n475\n00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,720\nand I want it to actually be\nexample.itprotv.net, you can do that.\n\n476\n00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640\nYou put your DNS at their servers.\n\n477\n00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,470\nBut they don't give you a way to\nupload an SSL certificate for that.\n\n478\n00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,990\nAnd there's a way that\ncost like $600 a year.\n\n479\n00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,040\nIt's not worth it.\n\n480\n00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,430\nAt that point, you go ahead and\nset up EC2 instance and host it that way.\n\n481\n00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,370\nSo, it's not all that powerful but\nit is suitable for certain things.\n\n482\n00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,370\nSimple basic web pages,\nyou can throw it in there.\n\n483\n00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,520\nYou got your files there you could\nactually host a decent bit of data.\n\n484\n00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,020\n>> That's awesome.\n\n485\n00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,880\nSo there's obviously a lot more to S3.\n\n486\n00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,890\nIf we wanted to dump a bunch of additional\ndata in here you certainly can.\n\n487\n00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,720\nWe can set it to replicate it's very,\nvery powerful.\n\n488\n00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,170\nBut the neat thing about it is, just about\nhow it's basically unlimited storage and\n\n489\n00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,900\nunlimited bandwidth and\nyou pay for what you use.\n\n490\n00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,280\nSo if you need to distribute content,\nit's a great way to do it.\n\n491\n00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,570\nWe use our own content,\n\n492\n00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,160\nif you want to download episodes from\nour site it comes right out of S3.\n\n493\n00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,120\nAnd that's a powerful thing for us,\nbecause we don't have to worry about that.\n\n494\n00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,182\n>> Let them handle that.\n\n495\n00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:35,725\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh you know,\n\n496\n00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:37,960\none thing I do wanna mention.\n\n497\n00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,322\nWhen you upload files into S3, they\ndon't really know what those files are,\n\n498\n00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:43,390\nthey just host it.\n\n499\n00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,850\nLike, we got the file,\nwe'll distribute it.\n\n500\n00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,590\nWe'll let the end users deal with it.\n\n501\n00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,890\nBut you can actually set a little\nbit of metadata on the files, and\n\n502\n00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,181\nthat will help control\nwhat that files does.\n\n503\n00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,800\nFor example, if you put a video in there.\n\n504\n00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,260\nWe might not want somebody\nto download the video.\n\n505\n00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,081\nWe might want the video\nto play in their browser.\n\n506\n00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:00,510\nAnd so we can set file metadata.\n\n507\n00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,460\nLet me show you that real\nquick before we wrap up.\n\n508\n00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,850\nI'm glad I remembered that.\n\n509\n00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,440\nSo if I go in here to that PDF that I\nuploaded, if I go to the properties for\n\n510\n00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,510\nthat, one of the little menu\nitems here I'll see is Metadata.\n\n511\n00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,350\nAnd you'll see, they tried to identify it.\n\n512\n00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,620\nThey said content type,\napplication/PDF, right?\n\n513\n00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,730\nSo they know it's a PDF.\n\n514\n00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,810\nAnd that's why when I go and\nbrowse to it, if I browse to that URL,\n\n515\n00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,110\nmy browser recognizes a PDF and\nit renders it.\n\n516\n00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,990\nCuz we have that content\ntype set to a PDF.\n\n517\n00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,120\nBut, I might wanna set that to something\na little more generic, so that when\n\n518\n00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,550\npeople browse to it, they download it,\ninstead of opening it in browser.\n\n519\n00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,530\nAnd so you can change it, they've\ngot preset metadata values here for\n\n520\n00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,530\na lot of the content types, but\nyou can also override that.\n\n521\n00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,080\nSo, I might set this string as\nsomething a little bit different,\n\n522\n00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,865\nlike binary/, oh shoot,\nI forget what the other name is.\n\n523\n00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,030\nBut, you can set it to whatever you want.\n\n524\n00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,080\nAnd if we override that metadata type,\nnow when somebody goes to get it,\n\n525\n00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,890\ntheir browser won't know that it's a PDF,\nand they'll download it instead.\n\n526\n00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,575\nOr, if it's a picture or\na movie, or whatever.\n\n527\n00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:07,315\nYou can choose that and\nnow it will recognize what that is.\n\n528\n00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,235\nAnd, notice how movies aren't in here.\n\n529\n00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:12,475\nSo you could actually set it to video/MP4,\nand\n\n530\n00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:16,185\nnow when people click on it, it'll play\nthe video as opposed to downloading it.\n\n531\n00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,965\nThat's something you\nmight need to manipulate.\n\n532\n00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:21,225\nAnd the Content Type metadata tag\nis the only one they create for\n\n533\n00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,850\nyou, which I just deleted.\n\n534\n00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,230\nBut, [LAUGH] but\nyou can come in here and add other ones.\n\n535\n00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,660\nThey've got some preset ones,\nlike Content Type,\n\n536\n00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,330\nwhich I'll put back since I deleted it.\n\n537\n00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,010\nAnd we can add in other ones too.\n\n538\n00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,985\nIf I want to add in an expiration.\n\n539\n00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,795\nI don't want this file\nto be available forever.\n\n540\n00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,835\nDisposition, Cache Control.\n\n541\n00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,145\nMaybe I don't want people to cache\nthis file, so I can come in and\n\n542\n00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:45,825\nI can define those settings.\n\n543\n00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:49,195\nYou've got that ability to\nset metadata on your files.\n\n544\n00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:50,685\n>> That's super cool.\n\n545\n00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:54,640\n>> My little word of advice here is, don't\nassume that they always get it right.\n\n546\n00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,060\nIt's a good idea to double check, right?\n\n547\n00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,690\nIt identified my PDF as a PDF,\nthat's great.\n\n548\n00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,592\nBut, sometimes it doesn't,\ndepending on the way you upload the file.\n\n549\n00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:02,791\n>> Awesome.\n\n550\n00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,890\nWell Don, I think we've gone through this.\n\n551\n00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,010\nIt's definitely like Dropbox and\nGoogle Drive,\n\n552\n00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,130\nthey're very awesome pieces of software.\n\n553\n00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,690\nBut this is like that but,\neven more so, very more robust.\n\n554\n00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,473\n>> Yeah, very scalable,\ntons of bandwidth, really good stuff.\n\n555\n00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,020\n>> Yeah, very awesome.\n\n556\n00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,960\nHave we tackled this monster though?\n\n557\n00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,530\nAt least officially for a general?\n\n558\n00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,030\n>> For an introductory level S3,\nI think we've covered the bases.\n\n559\n00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,660\n>> Excellent.\n\n560\n00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,160\nWell, I guess that being said, we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n561\n00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,960\nSo for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,711\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n563\n00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:33,931\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n564\n00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:40,000\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode if ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,060\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,350\nHere with me today is Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,400\nHow are you doing today Don?\n\n7\n00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,330\n>> I'm doing great Dan.\n\n8\n00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,860\nYou know today we're gonna be jumping\nback into Amazon Web Services,\n\n9\n00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,540\nand we're gonna be looking at\nbuilding a relational database\n\n10\n00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,940\ncompletely hosted an Amazon Web Services\ncloud which is a pretty awesome thing.\n\n11\n00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,305\n>> Yeah, I'm not related to any databases,\nbut I guess we can build one, right?\n\n12\n00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:36,390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,905\nin business today,\ndatabases have become extremely important.\n\n14\n00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,215\nPeople need to be able to store data and\n\n15\n00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,515\nreturn it when they need\nto gather information.\n\n16\n00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:45,625\nThere's a lot of web sites,\n\n17\n00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:50,585\nlike WordPress backed websites, where all\nthe content is coming out of a database.\n\n18\n00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,085\nOr if you've got an e-commerce site,\nall your sales and\n\n19\n00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,355\ninventory is in that database.\n\n20\n00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,560\nThese are really important things.\n\n21\n00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,580\n>> Well the traditional model\nis that if you need a database,\n\n22\n00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,750\nyou build it up in your own data center\nyou know right in your own office.\n\n23\n00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,980\nBut there's shortcomings that come into\nthat when you decide to host your own\n\n24\n00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,870\ndatabase, and\nthey center mostly around the hardware and\n\n25\n00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,590\nexpertise needed to run database servers.\n\n26\n00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,440\n>> Yeah.\nThe great thing about databases is that\n\n27\n00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,480\nthey require very little hardware and\nvery little expertise.\n\n28\n00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,500\nAnd by that I mean the opposite of that.\n\n29\n00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,090\nThey require tons of hardware and\ntons of expertise.\n\n30\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,320\nI know I tried to build a few myself, and\njust the resources necessary to keep those\n\n31\n00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,640\nguys up and running, a lot of input output\nkinda stuff, read writes and all that.\n\n32\n00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,580\nIt gets quite overwhelming.\n\n33\n00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,990\n>> And the people who suffer from\nthis the most are developers,\n\n34\n00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,570\nwhere you might be a top notch developer\nable or just write anything you need in C,\n\n35\n00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,350\nor whatever programming language you use,\nbut you don't know databases.\n\n36\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,370\nThat, sure you know how to do Transact-SQL\nto store data in a database, but\n\n37\n00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,210\nyou don't know how to build\nthat database server itself.\n\n38\n00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,030\nAnd so maybe you follow some tutorial on\nthe web, and you do a quick install, and\n\n39\n00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,140\nyou get it up and running,\nbut it's not secure.\n\n40\n00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,620\nIt's not scalable.\n\n41\n00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,950\nThe storage isn't tuned right, and\nall of that has a significant impact.\n\n42\n00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,470\nMaybe not when you have two\npeople in your database server.\n\n43\n00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,990\nBut when you have 200,000 people in that\ndatabase server, it makes a huge impact.\n\n44\n00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,020\nSo with the hosted database on AWS,\n\n45\n00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,270\nwhat we're doing is we're we're\noutsourcing that expertise.\n\n46\n00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,870\nAmazon has some of the largest databases\nin the world and that means they\n\n47\n00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,670\nhave some of the best database\nadministrator staff that you can ask for.\n\n48\n00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,810\nAnd with a hosted relational database,\nwe're using their resources,\n\n49\n00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,730\ntheir experts.\n\n50\n00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,300\nThey tune the databases, or they tune the\nunderlying infrastructure, the storage,\n\n51\n00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,170\nthe operating system they take care of\nall of that, and what we end up with\n\n52\n00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,340\nis really just a series of menu events\nthat we fill out that tells them what kind\n\n53\n00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,520\nof database we want, and\nthen they help support it on the back end.\n\n54\n00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,970\nIt's a great solution.\n\n55\n00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,800\n>> Nice to get that A-Team from Amazon,\n\n56\n00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,490\nplus that awesome hardware that they\nuse to get all of this stuff running.\n\n57\n00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,429\n>> And if you want full and\ntotal control of your database than\n\n58\n00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,320\nthe Amazon's RDS service is not for\nyou, right?\n\n59\n00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,880\nIf you want full and total control\nthen the best bet to host in the cloud\n\n60\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,110\nis to simply bring up an EC2 instance.\n\n61\n00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,630\nAnd you can bring up a regular EC2 server,\nand you can throw MySQL or\n\n62\n00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,130\nMicrosoft Sequel on there and\nnow you have full control over, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,800\nBut if you wanna replicate between\navailability zones and things like that,\n\n64\n00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,010\nyou've gotta set it up on your own, and\nthat requires knowledge of the database.\n\n65\n00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,180\nAnd I know many DBAs out there\nwhere that's exactly what they do.\n\n66\n00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,730\nThey say, no, I know how to run my\ndatabase, I know better than Amazon, so\n\n67\n00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,300\nI wanna control it,\nI'll do an EC2 instance.\n\n68\n00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,613\nBut if we wanna really take advantage\nof the good stuff on Amazon,\n\n69\n00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,251\nwe wanna use their RDS service.\n\n70\n00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:36,087\nSo let's take a look at that service,\nwill spin up some databases, and\n\n71\n00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,760\nget a chance can see\nhow all of that works.\n\n72\n00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,320\nAll right,\nwell I'm logged into my AWS console here,\n\n73\n00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,320\nand buried away in the console here you've\ngot the database section down here.\n\n74\n00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,142\nAnd there's a few different types\nof databases that are available for\n\n75\n00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,930\ndifferent purposes.\n\n76\n00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,200\nThe RDS one, that's the relational\ndatabase service, and\n\n77\n00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,590\nit's the most popular.\n\n78\n00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,930\nRelational databases are pretty\nmuch the standard for\n\n79\n00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,720\nany kind of business analytics or\nbusiness intelligence.\n\n80\n00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,220\nSo we see where they support MySQL,\nPostgreSQL, Oracle,\n\n81\n00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,200\nMicrosoft SQL, and Amazon Aurora,\ntheir own internal build.\n\n82\n00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,390\nSo a couple of different database choices\nto pick from there, and they add to that.\n\n83\n00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,210\nWhen it first launched,\nthey only supported MySQL,\n\n84\n00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,820\nand then they added Microsoft, and\nthey kind of continued to add to that.\n\n85\n00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,720\nThe other databases are a little\nmore specialized, like DynamoDB.\n\n86\n00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,810\nThat's not a relational database,\nthat's an object oriented database.\n\n87\n00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,940\nSo it doesn't have a schema,\nit handles huge amounts of data.\n\n88\n00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,820\nIt's a NoSQL database.\n\n89\n00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,850\nRight?\nIt's a Not Only SQL.\n\n90\n00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,680\nYou got Elasticache,\nwhich is just designed for\n\n91\n00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,150\ncaching between servers if you're trying\nto do, like, distributed authentication.\n\n92\n00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,940\nAnd we've got Redshift which is\ndesigned for massive scales of data.\n\n93\n00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,230\nSee how it says managed\npetabyte scale data warehouses?\n\n94\n00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,760\nSo if you're sequencing the human genome\nor something, and you've got tons and\n\n95\n00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,560\ntons of data,\nthat's what redshift is designed for.\n\n96\n00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,440\nBut the most popular service is RDS,\nand that's we're normally gonna go for.\n\n97\n00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,840\nNow once you jump into RDS,\nthat's where you get a chance to see\n\n98\n00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,010\nany databases that you've\nalready hosted with Amazon.\n\n99\n00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,640\nAnd you'll have the opportunity to\ngo in and start to create more.\n\n100\n00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,300\nSo once we get into the RDS dashboard, if\nyou've already got some database instances\n\n101\n00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,110\ncreated, you'll see information\nabout them right up here at the top.\n\n102\n00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,970\nIf you don't have any created then\nthese will all just say zero,\n\n103\n00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,300\nand you've gotta\nLaunch DB Instance down here.\n\n104\n00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,740\nThat's typically where we wanna start.\n\n105\n00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,040\nI wanna create a database instance,\nand this is the wizard that does it.\n\n106\n00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,580\nWhen we launch it, it's gonna\nask the most important question,\n\n107\n00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,750\nwhich is,\nwhat type of database do you want?\n\n108\n00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,190\nI mentioned we had MySQL,\nPostSQL, Oracle, SQL, so\n\n109\n00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,180\nyou had a few different\nones you can choose from.\n\n110\n00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,180\nMySQL is the community edition.\n\n111\n00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,890\nThat's the free database\nserver from Oracle.\n\n112\n00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,010\nThere is a paid version, but Amazon\ndoesn't directly support that just yet.\n\n113\n00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,000\nThey're talking about\ndoing that in the future.\n\n114\n00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,850\nBut you can drop down here to Oracle.\n\n115\n00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,860\nAnd that's where you've got the full\nOracle enterprise database server.\n\n116\n00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,580\nAnd you can pick one of those installs.\n\n117\n00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,860\nYou got PostgreSQL,\nwhich is another free database solution.\n\n118\n00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,500\nAnd then you got Microsoft SQL Server,\nwhich has a free edition, The Express, and\n\n119\n00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,600\nthen the other ones are paid\nversions that you can choose.\n\n120\n00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,930\nNow if I wanna create one,\nI'll create a SQL server here.\n\n121\n00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,920\nAnd I'll go with the standard edition.\n\n122\n00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,240\nSo I'm gonna whip up a standard\nedition server and get that created.\n\n123\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,540\nNow when I do that,\nthis is a paid software product.\n\n124\n00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,650\nMicrosoft SQL, you have to license that.\n\n125\n00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,020\nIt's not open source,\nyou can't just choose to run it.\n\n126\n00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,530\nSo when I choose that, one of the question\nit's gonna ask me on a later screen\n\n127\n00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,310\nis how I'm gonna handle my licensing.\n\n128\n00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,720\nAnd there's a few different models, but\n\n129\n00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,660\nthe primary models are where we bring our\nown license, and that means that we've\n\n130\n00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,820\nalready got it licensed through\nan enterprise agreement or\n\n131\n00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,640\nsomething like that with Microsoft,\nand so we cover the license ourselves.\n\n132\n00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,680\nOr you can choose license provided\nwhere Amazon provides the license, and\n\n133\n00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,320\nyour per hour rate for\nrunning that server is gonna up.\n\n134\n00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,860\nThe just charge a little\nmore to cover the license.\n\n135\n00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,360\nAll right, on the next screen it's\ngonna ask how I wanna deploy this.\n\n136\n00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,510\nIf you're just testing and practicing,\n\n137\n00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,350\nthen you'll choose this option down here\nwhich says this instance is intended for\n\n138\n00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,750\nuse outside of production, or\nunder the free usage tier.\n\n139\n00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,550\nThis means you're gonna have\na single database server.\n\n140\n00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,890\nJust one server running in one region,\none zone, and just sitting there, right?\n\n141\n00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,890\nIf there's a failure,\nthat database will go offline,\n\n142\n00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,600\nand that's not what we want in production.\n\n143\n00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,530\nThe other option is to do\na multi-availability zone deployment\n\n144\n00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,273\nwith Provisioned IOPS Storage,\nand what all of that means is\n\n145\n00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:35,750\nAmazon's gonna give you a highly scalable,\nhighly redundant database deployment,\n\n146\n00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,330\nand you don't have to worry\nabout the details, right?\n\n147\n00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,440\nMultiple availability zones.\n\n148\n00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,680\nIf I deploy this server in\nthe Virginia region, right,\n\n149\n00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,193\nwhich is eastern United States.\n\n150\n00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:46,719\nSo if I deployed in that region,\n\n151\n00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,498\nthere's four availability\nzones inside of that region.\n\n152\n00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:54,237\nThat means in Virginia, Amazon has\nfour completely isolated data centers\n\n153\n00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:59,139\nthat have separate power, separate\nnetworks, separate infrastructure.\n\n154\n00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,975\nCompletely separate data centers.\n\n155\n00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,179\nIf I choose Multi-AZ Deployment,\n\n156\n00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:07,373\nIt's gonna give me a SQL server in\none of those availability zones.\n\n157\n00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:08,534\nAnd at a minimum,\n\n158\n00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,690\nit's gonna create a read-only\nreplica in one of the other zones.\n\n159\n00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,580\nAnd that means that if my primary fails\nI can flip over that replica, and\n\n160\n00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,110\nwe can make that the primary and\noff we go.\n\n161\n00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,620\nWe avoid downtime.\n\n162\n00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,940\nThey set all that up for you.\n\n163\n00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,670\nIf you've ever set this up\non a database yourself,\n\n164\n00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,900\nit's kinda challenging to get\nthe replication set up and all that.\n\n165\n00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,620\nThey take care of it for us.\n\n166\n00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,460\nAnd then Provisioned iOS per second.\n\n167\n00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,260\nWhat they're saying here is we're\ngonna handle managing the storage.\n\n168\n00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,150\nI know I've mentioned this in\nsome of our other episodes, but\n\n169\n00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,250\nwhen you do a database server, storage\nis a big challenge, the input, output.\n\n170\n00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,350\nWhen you write to the hard drive and\nwhen you read from the hard drive.\n\n171\n00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,330\nIf you've got an old app database, right?\n\n172\n00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,550\nOnline analysis processing, that's\na database where you do a lot of reads.\n\n173\n00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,787\nThink about if you go to Amazon shopping\nsite and you go a search for X-Files DVD,\n\n174\n00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:02,858\nright, it's gonna query\na database looking for responses.\n\n175\n00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,220\nIt's not gonna change the database.\n\n176\n00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,720\nIt's just looking for data and\nbringing it back out.\n\n177\n00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,900\nThat's all app and\nthat's a heavy read operation.\n\n178\n00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,580\nBut then when you go to actually buy\nsomething, you're creating an order and\n\n179\n00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,550\nthat order is being written to their\nsales database, that's a write.\n\n180\n00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,460\nThat's online transaction processing or\nOLTP.\n\n181\n00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,760\nSo, either way,\nyou need a certain level of reads and\n\n182\n00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,910\na certain level of writes to\nbe performed on a drive, and\n\n183\n00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,400\nif the drive starts to get backed up then\nthe server is slower for your users.\n\n184\n00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800\nAnd you don't want that, right?\n\n185\n00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,090\nSo, back in the days when we did\nour own hosted SQL servers or\n\n186\n00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,460\ndatabase servers,\nyou'd have to spec out the drives.\n\n187\n00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,750\nYou'd have to say, all right, I want two\ndrives mirrored for the OS, mirrored for\n\n188\n00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,730\nredundancy.\n\n189\n00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,620\nYou'd have two drives mirrored for\nthe page file.\n\n190\n00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,170\nYou'd have a couple of drives either\nmirrored or in a five array for\n\n191\n00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,720\nthe transaction log files\nto handle faster writes.\n\n192\n00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,480\nAnd then you'd have a bigger array that\nwas array ten for your database files and\n\n193\n00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,880\nthat would be for the reads.\n\n194\n00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,098\nThen see they spec out all this hardware.\n\n195\n00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:01,650\nAnd then you have to monitor the input and\n\n196\n00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,510\noutput on it to make sure the hardware\nis able to keep up with the traffic.\n\n197\n00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,680\nIt's a lot of work.\n\n198\n00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560\nWell here they'll take care of it for\nus, it's Provisioned IOPS.\n\n199\n00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760\nAnd if my servers start to get busy,\nI can always go in here and\n\n200\n00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,380\nbump up the instance to get\nmore performance out of it.\n\n201\n00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,430\nIt's no big deal, right?\n\n202\n00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,120\nIt's all managed for us.\n\n203\n00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,420\nSo this is what we typically want.\n\n204\n00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,080\nNow, there is no free usage tier when\nit comes to the multi-easy deployment.\n\n205\n00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,610\nSo if you're just learning,\nyou are gonna incur costs.\n\n206\n00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,381\nJust make sure you delete your\ninstances when you're done with them.\n\n207\n00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:30,757\nSo now we get to the nitty gritty details\nof this instance, where we go through and\n\n208\n00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:34,480\nspecify a few of things that we need to\nunderstand before we deploy this, right?\n\n209\n00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,940\nSo here's that licensing\nthat I've mentioned.\n\n210\n00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,500\nAm I gonna bring my own license or\nam I getting a license included?\n\n211\n00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,660\nWell I have my own license, but\nI can't remember it offhand.\n\n212\n00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,580\nI don't have my keys with me.\n\n213\n00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,500\nSo all good new license included\nthat means Amazon's gonna take care\n\n214\n00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,350\nof the license.\n\n215\n00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,120\nAnd I'll just pay a little more for\nthis database while it runs.\n\n216\n00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,010\n>> I can't believe you didn't\nmemorize your key, Don.\n\n217\n00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,940\n>> Those 25-digit Microsoft keys,\nthey're fun.\n\n218\n00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,697\n>> So shank.\n\n219\n00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,800\n>> [LAUGH] All right, then I've got my\ndatabase engine version, and you'll\n\n220\n00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,900\nsee that they support two different engine\nversion, SQL version 10 and version 11.\n\n221\n00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,212\nI'll go with version 11.\n\n222\n00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,640\nVersion 12's coming out later this year,\nbut Amazon doesn't support that just yet.\n\n223\n00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,110\nSo you pick the version of SQL that\nyou need, then the instance class.\n\n224\n00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,180\nNow the instance class is what's gonna\ndetermine how much CPU power and\n\n225\n00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,500\nhow much RAM you have.\n\n226\n00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,140\nAnd see how mine's defaulting\nto a m3 extra large.\n\n227\n00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,100\nRight, four CPUs with 15 gigs of RAM.\n\n228\n00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,720\nThat may be exactly what I need.\n\n229\n00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,260\nThat might be way overkill.\n\n230\n00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,520\nI might look at this and say, that would\ndefinitely handle a 200 gig database but\n\n231\n00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,560\nI'm dealing with a much smaller database.\n\n232\n00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,250\nSo I might wanna scale that down.\n\n233\n00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,930\nWe can always change this as we go, right.\n\n234\n00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,140\nSo we can increase or\ndecrease as our server load handles.\n\n235\n00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,460\nIf I'm just in testing and development,\nI might go with a lower server.\n\n236\n00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,270\nJust because I know I'm in testing and\ndevelopment.\n\n237\n00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,500\nAnd then when I move it into production\nI can bump it up to higher end hardware.\n\n238\n00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,120\n>> Yeah, I can really see the advantage\nof being able to switch that,\n\n239\n00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,350\nbecause sometimes you're working and\n\n240\n00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,690\ndatabases have a standard baseline\nthat they're gonna be operating under.\n\n241\n00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,280\nAnd then every now and then,\nyou're like we got a big project.\n\n242\n00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,030\nAnd there are lot of rewrites going on.\n\n243\n00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,330\nSo we just bump it up and\nthen when we're done bump it back down.\n\n244\n00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,550\nSave a little more money.\n\n245\n00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,390\n>> Yeah, great example.\n\n246\n00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,360\nI set up a solution for\n\n247\n00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,360\na company a few years back where\nthey were a sales organization.\n\n248\n00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,250\nAnd, at the end of the month,\nit was really on the first or\n\n249\n00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,720\nthe second of the month, is when they'd\nrun all their big sales reports and\n\n250\n00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,940\nall of their data indexing and\ndata mining.\n\n251\n00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,200\nWell, that meant that for 28 or\n29 days a month the database was busy.\n\n252\n00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,860\nYou had a lot of reads and\nwrites cuz they did their own operations.\n\n253\n00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,440\nBut for two days a month it\nreally had heavy activity during\n\n254\n00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,190\nduring those times when they\nwere doing all their analysis.\n\n255\n00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,790\nSo what we did is we threw\nin the cloud like this.\n\n256\n00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,260\nAnd for most of the month the server\njust ran with medium level hardware.\n\n257\n00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,391\nAnd then for\nthose two days we would just bump it up.\n\n258\n00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:51,150\nAnd it would handle that load just fine.\n\n259\n00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,970\nAnd then we would bump it\nback down when we were done.\n\n260\n00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,685\nAs opposed to having to buy an extra beefy\nserver and waste those resources for\n\n261\n00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:57,611\nmost of the month.\n\n262\n00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,592\n>> Yeah, awesome stuff.\n\n263\n00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,850\n>> All right,\nnow I chose to do a multi-AZ deployments.\n\n264\n00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,120\nAnd depending on the database\nsolution that you chose,\n\n265\n00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,850\nthey handle these deployments differently.\n\n266\n00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,320\nSo if I choose MySQL or\nif I choose Microsoft SQL,\n\n267\n00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,990\nthey have different replication\ntechnologies inside there.\n\n268\n00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,420\nNotice with Microsoft SQL I've\ngot this Yes mirroring or No.\n\n269\n00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,520\nSo I've got mirroring as my option.\n\n270\n00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,730\nIt's gonna create another copy of\nthis database server in another zone,\n\n271\n00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,550\nand it's gonna mirror it.\n\n272\n00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,050\nSo anything written to one zone\ngets written to the other zone.\n\n273\n00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,470\nThere are mirror images of each other.\n\n274\n00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,460\nIf one fails I can jump\nover to the other one.\n\n275\n00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,690\nAll right, then we've got our storage.\n\n276\n00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,140\nIt's offering to store it on\nGeneral Purpose SSD, right,\n\n277\n00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,670\nsolid state drives, and it's giving\nme 200 gigs of allocated storage.\n\n278\n00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,950\nI can increase that if I need to.\n\n279\n00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,390\nNotice, over here,\nthe maximum is 1 terabyte.\n\n280\n00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,450\nIf we wanna go higher than a terabyte,\nyou actually can.\n\n281\n00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,310\nYou just can't do it here from the GUI.\n\n282\n00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,673\nYou can do it through\na support ticket to Amazon or\n\n283\n00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:55,411\nyou can do it from the command line.\n\n284\n00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:59,570\nAnd then we can also choose to move\nback to magnetic drives, if we want.\n\n285\n00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,230\nNot really any need for that anymore.\n\n286\n00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,810\nOr Provisioned iOS.\n\n287\n00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,730\nWhen you go Provisioned iOS,\n\n288\n00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,560\nthat's gonna guarantee you a certain\ndata rate to those drives.\n\n289\n00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,310\nWhen you choose general purpose SSD,\n\n290\n00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,850\nthe SSDs that you're using might be\nshared with other Amazon customers.\n\n291\n00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,050\nAnd while it's partitioned\nyou can't see their data,\n\n292\n00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,360\nthey can't see your data,\nyou are accessing the same hardware.\n\n293\n00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,120\nSo if they get really busy,\nit can impact your server.\n\n294\n00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,600\nIf we do Provisioned iOS,\nthat won't happen.\n\n295\n00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,730\nNow we're guaranteed a certain level,\nit's a service level agreement, SLA.\n\n296\n00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,330\nWe're guaranteed a certain\nperformance level on our storage.\n\n297\n00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,300\nAnd you'll see this one,\nset to 2,000 is kind of my default.\n\n298\n00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,600\nWe can bump that up or\nreduce it based on what we need.\n\n299\n00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,390\nAnd they give us the minimum\nrequirements here.\n\n300\n00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,170\nSQL Server Standard Edition\nrequires a fixed ratio\n\n301\n00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,570\nof 10 IOPS per gigabyte of storage.\n\n302\n00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,570\nI did 200 gigs, and that means by\nminimum requirement here is 2,000.\n\n303\n00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,680\nBut I might wanna bump that higher\nif I wanna guarantee performance\n\n304\n00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,230\non the storage.\n\n305\n00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,670\nNow, mine's just a test server, so\nI'll put it back to general and leave it.\n\n306\n00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,880\nThen, I need to create\na DB instance identifier.\n\n307\n00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360\nNow, this does not have\nto be the database name.\n\n308\n00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,170\nMost people do that, right?\n\n309\n00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,190\nI mean, I'm gonna create a database.\n\n310\n00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,340\nI'll put the database name here.\n\n311\n00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,740\nBut it doesn't have to match.\n\n312\n00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,040\nThis is actually the instance itself, and\n\n313\n00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,280\nyou could have more than one\ndatabase stored in an instance.\n\n314\n00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,960\nSo you can call it whatever you want.\n\n315\n00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,071\nI'll call this one itprotv-mssql02.\n\n316\n00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,991\nI've already got a Microsoft SQL server,\nthis'll be my second one.\n\n317\n00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,671\nAnd then you create the user account.\n\n318\n00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:29,670\nI'll just create a user account for\nmyself.\n\n319\n00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,310\nOnce you're connected, you can create as\nmany other user accounts as you want.\n\n320\n00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,570\nThis is just the first one.\n\n321\n00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,962\nAnd this one will be\na system admin in SQL, so\n\n322\n00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,171\nwe'll have full access to that server.\n\n323\n00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,860\nNow the networking side.\n\n324\n00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,890\nWhen we deploy a database server\nthe default is to go into\n\n325\n00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,260\nwell our default VPC,\nwhich is exposed to the Internet.\n\n326\n00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,390\nNow we can use security\ngroups to protect that.\n\n327\n00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,634\nBut when you deploy a database\nserver we normally wanna protect it.\n\n328\n00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,745\nWe wanna isolate it from the Internet.\n\n329\n00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:00,998\nSo often times you'll create\na dedicated VPC for it.\n\n330\n00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:04,504\nSo see how I've got this one here,\nitprotv-private-vpc.\n\n331\n00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:08,640\nI've got this private VPC that\nthe internet can't get to.\n\n332\n00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,940\nAnd instead, what I do is I use security\ngroups to allow communications from my\n\n333\n00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,020\npublic VPC to the database.\n\n334\n00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,360\nSo my servers can get to the database but\nthe internet can't.\n\n335\n00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,190\nThat gives us a basic level of protection.\n\n336\n00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,170\nNow, somebody could still hack\ninto my production server,\n\n337\n00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,140\nmy one that's public, and then jump\nleap frog back into the private one.\n\n338\n00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,120\nSo it's not 100% foolproof but\nthis does give us some basic protection.\n\n339\n00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,990\nAll right then we can attach it to\na different subnet group if we want to.\n\n340\n00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,580\nIf we're doing multiple AZ\navailabilities own deployments,\n\n341\n00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,320\nit really does need its own subnet so\nit can spread it between those so\n\n342\n00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,970\nI'll just leave that at create new.\n\n343\n00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,290\nI'm not going to make this one publicly\naccessible, it's in its own VPC and\n\n344\n00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,090\nI can specify what availability\nzone I want it to reside in.\n\n345\n00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,510\nThis is the primary,\n\n346\n00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:00,060\nthe redundant copy will go into wherever\nAmazon has the most availability.\n\n347\n00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,960\nAnd so then we can pick our\nsecurity group, if we've got one.\n\n348\n00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,138\nI'll just do a new one.\n\n349\n00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:07,410\nAll right now Microsoft SQL does\ndefault to port 1433 for access.\n\n350\n00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,140\nWe can override that if we want right here\nin the Wizard, or we can leave it alone.\n\n351\n00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,310\nWe've got our parameter groups in option\ngroups which are ways that we can define\n\n352\n00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,850\ncustom SQL settings.\n\n353\n00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,450\nIf you're going to be deploying\n20 of these SQL servers,\n\n354\n00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,540\nyou want them all configured the same way.\n\n355\n00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,590\nYou can create parameter and\noption groups that define those settings,\n\n356\n00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,880\nso you might want to disable\ncertain features in SQL, or\n\n357\n00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,710\nenable certain features, you can do that\nthrough your parameter in option groups.\n\n358\n00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,440\nWe can also turn on encryption.\n\n359\n00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640\nIf you've got sensitive data and\n\n360\n00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,220\nyou're worried about it being\nhosted on common storage at Amazon,\n\n361\n00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,540\nyou can encrypt it and that provides\nsome some additional protection.\n\n362\n00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,420\nBackups, this is one of\nthe really nice things.\n\n363\n00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,920\nAmazon's gonna back up our server for us.\n\n364\n00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,140\nWe don't have to worry\nabout setting up backups.\n\n365\n00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,780\nThe default is that it's\ngonna backup once a day and\n\n366\n00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,030\nit's got a backup retention\nperiod of seven days.\n\n367\n00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,100\nSo I can restore anywhere back\nto a week from now if I need to.\n\n368\n00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,900\nYou can bump that up or lower it down.\n\n369\n00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,400\nYou can turn off the automated backups if\nyou want or you can bump up even further.\n\n370\n00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,790\nYou'll see this maxes out at 35 days.\n\n371\n00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,800\nSo it only goes back so far but\nit's an automated backup system.\n\n372\n00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,380\nNow backups generate a lot of read\nactivity on the database and they\n\n373\n00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,510\ncan lock records while they're being read\nso it can create a performance impact.\n\n374\n00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,350\nSo you've got this option\nto pick a backup window.\n\n375\n00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,930\nThe backup window, it defaults to this\nno preference, I haven't created any.\n\n376\n00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,040\nBut when you set this maintenance window,\nwhat you do is you basically say,\n\n377\n00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,960\nI want to do the backup between 2 AM and\n3 AM cuz I know my server is not busy or\n\n378\n00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,590\nwhatever, all right?\n\n379\n00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,230\nSo you kinda pick that time.\n\n380\n00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,530\nIf you don't pick a time, then Amazon's\nwill just back it up whenever it\n\n381\n00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,670\nthinks the resource utilization is lower.\n\n382\n00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,850\nYou don't know when that time will be,\n\n383\n00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,990\nso it may be something you\nwant to go in and define.\n\n384\n00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,650\nAnd then upgrades,\nAmazon is managing our SQL server for us.\n\n385\n00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,240\nSo I don't have to worry\nabout the backups,\n\n386\n00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,920\nI don't have to worry about the disk IO.\n\n387\n00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,590\nI don't have to worry about upgrades.\n\n388\n00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,210\nWe can do auto minor upgrades.\n\n389\n00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:03,080\nNow minor,\nthat means if I'm running SQL 2013 and\n\n390\n00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,620\nSQL 2016 comes out,\nthey're not gonna do a major upgrade.\n\n391\n00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,060\nBut minor upgrades, things like security\nfixes, hot fixes, even service packs,\n\n392\n00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,990\nthey can deploy for me and that's\nthe default is to automatically deploy it.\n\n393\n00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,570\nYou can set a maintenance window for\nwhen that happens, because there's almost\n\n394\n00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,270\nalways downtime involved unless\nyou've got a multi AZ deployment.\n\n395\n00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,450\nThen they'll actually handle the juggling\nbetween the two different hosts.\n\n396\n00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,350\nAnd so you can specify that window, and I\nhaven't created any maintenance window, so\n\n397\n00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,670\nI don't have any in my list.\n\n398\n00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,540\nAll right, once we've got all that we\ncan launch the database instance, and\n\n399\n00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,670\nit's gonna go in and create that.\n\n400\n00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,305\nAnd oh, I forgot to pick a subnet group.\n\n401\n00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:42,376\nLet's see, I need to create a subnet group\nand oh, it's gonna make me go and create,\n\n402\n00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:45,380\nI've hit my maximum subnets apparently for\nthis one.\n\n403\n00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,800\nLet me just put that back in the default.\n\n404\n00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,750\nThat'll fix that for me.\n\n405\n00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,730\nThere we go.\n\n406\n00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,960\nAnd now it's gonna launch that instance.\n\n407\n00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,740\nNow, in the other shows,\nwhere we did things like fired up an EC2\n\n408\n00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,940\ninstance that happened pretty fast,\nthis is not fast.\n\n409\n00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,020\nAll right and the reason it's not fast is\nit's got to build up two instances, two\n\n410\n00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,550\ndifferent availability zones and then it's\ngot to set up replication between them and\n\n411\n00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,460\nit's got to do those kind of things,\nits got to provision the IO.\n\n412\n00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,650\nThis one take a while, right.\n\n413\n00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,160\nSo you start this one up and then you,\nyou know, you go get a cup of coffee you\n\n414\n00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,020\nrelax whatever it's going to take\na little while to get that one created.\n\n415\n00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,610\nSo to save us some time, I went ahead and\ncreated some before the show.\n\n416\n00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,780\nI created a Microsoft SQL instance and\nI created a MySQL instance.\n\n417\n00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,320\nMySQL is set up basically the same way,\n\n418\n00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,470\nexcept you don't worry about\nlicensing on that one it's free.\n\n419\n00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,740\nSo, once you've got those up and\n\n420\n00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,480\nrunning, next you just connect to\nthem like any old server, right?\n\n421\n00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,540\nWell before you can connect\nthey are protected.\n\n422\n00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,180\nAmazon knows that databases\nare a primary target so\n\n423\n00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,660\nyou'll typically have to modify their\nsecurity group to allow you access.\n\n424\n00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,830\nIf I take a look at this\nMicrosoft SQL instance here,\n\n425\n00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,390\nI'm just gonna expand it out, here's the\nname of the server so that's who I'm gonna\n\n426\n00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,540\nconnect to right here so I'm just\ngonna I'm gonna try and copy that.\n\n427\n00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380\nThere we go.\n\n428\n00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,300\nSo I'm going to copy that\nbig long name right there.\n\n429\n00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,980\nThat's the name that was\nassigned to that server.\n\n430\n00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,330\nBut before I can connect, I need to go\nin here and find the security group.\n\n431\n00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,380\nSo here's my security group that it made,\nand\n\n432\n00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,140\nI need to make sure that\nI'm allowed to access it.\n\n433\n00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,460\nSo if I go into that security group and\nI go to inbound,\n\n434\n00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,140\nsee how it's got this MS SQL rule?\n\n435\n00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,940\nAnd it's tied to an IP address.\n\n436\n00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,620\nWell, when you ran the wizard, it looked\nat your IP and it added you to the list.\n\n437\n00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,110\nIf you were on one computer when you set\nthis up and you moved to a different\n\n438\n00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,760\ncomputer, your IP might have changed and\nyou might not have access to the server.\n\n439\n00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,680\nSo you might have to come in here and\nedit that, and it's easy enough to do.\n\n440\n00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,420\nYou can come in here and\ntell it to approve my IP and\n\n441\n00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,240\nthat'll add whatever your current IP is.\n\n442\n00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,750\nOr you can add in your own ranges and\nyou can approve MySQL,\n\n443\n00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,800\nor MS SQL, or whatever it is that you are\nconnecting with to get in there, right.\n\n444\n00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,480\nSo you might need to do that\nbefore you're able to connect.\n\n445\n00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,540\nBut once that's done, you fire up\nwhatever your management tool is and\n\n446\n00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,520\nyou get connected.\n\n447\n00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,350\nSo for example, that Microsoft Server,\nif I jump over to a Windows machine,\n\n448\n00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,980\nI can fire up the SQL Management Studio.\n\n449\n00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,830\nI can go up here to connect.\n\n450\n00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,890\nI'll connect to a database engine.\n\n451\n00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,010\nI'm gonna provide that server name.\n\n452\n00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,040\nI'm gonna get rid of the port.\n\n453\n00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,800\nSince I use the default port,\nI don't need to provide it.\n\n454\n00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,350\nAnd then I can give it the username and\n\n455\n00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,400\npassword that I provided\nduring the set up.\n\n456\n00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,750\nAnd once we get connected,\nit's going to reach out,\n\n457\n00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,720\nit's going to connect to that server.\n\n458\n00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,150\nThere it goes.\n\n459\n00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,740\nAnd now I can start to create databases.\n\n460\n00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,970\nI've already created one database in your\nsales DB but I can create other ones.\n\n461\n00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,490\nMaybe I can create a marketing database,\nso I'll get that one punched in here.\n\n462\n00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,420\nAnd we start to get that set, and\n\n463\n00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,920\nnow I've got more than one database\nin the same instance but that's fine.\n\n464\n00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,160\nNow, it's up to me to determine whether or\nnot I should separate these guys out or\n\n465\n00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,020\nkeep them together.\n\n466\n00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020\nI could always create more instances.\n\n467\n00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,110\nBut now I've got my databases, and\n\n468\n00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,340\nI work with them just like they\nwere hosted right here in house.\n\n469\n00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,900\nIt doesn't matter to me that\nit's in the cloud versus here.\n\n470\n00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,240\nI connect to it, and\nI work with it with the tools that I know.\n\n471\n00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,580\nSo if I'm a database administrator,\n\n472\n00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,550\nI don't have to worry about\nthat cloud stuff anymore.\n\n473\n00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,960\nI just work in the tools I know.\n\n474\n00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,260\nMySQL is the same way.\n\n475\n00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,950\nI can fire up, like, my SQL work bench,\n\n476\n00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,350\nwhich I've got floating\naround here somewhere, here.\n\n477\n00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,230\nAnd I'll connect to my MySQL instance.\n\n478\n00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,300\nNow, when I set this up.\n\n479\n00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,890\nAgain, I just punched in that server name,\nright, that I pulled right from\n\n480\n00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,330\nthe console and my SQL runs on 3306 by\ndefault for its ports, I punch that in.\n\n481\n00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,780\nSo you just provide basic data and\nthen you connect up.\n\n482\n00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,630\nAnd it's gonna reach out and\nconnect to that server and\n\n483\n00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,260\nonce I'm in, now I'm connected.\n\n484\n00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,440\nI just start working with\nit just like I'm used to.\n\n485\n00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,690\nNothing too crazy as far\nas working with the system.\n\n486\n00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,950\nI've already created a little\nsales database down here, and\n\n487\n00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,090\nI can go into my tables and\nI can create a new table.\n\n488\n00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,740\nAnd so this can be, like, sales receipts.\n\n489\n00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,860\nAnd we start to add in our columns,\nand all that other good stuff.\n\n490\n00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,170\nWork with it like a normal database.\n\n491\n00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,170\n>> Yeah, that's really awesome.\n\n492\n00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,100\nI mean, for the fact that like,\nI'm a developer, I need the database,\n\n493\n00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,990\nI can just spin one of these\nup very quickly, very easily.\n\n494\n00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,970\nIt didn't seem too difficult,\nto be honest with you, and\n\n495\n00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,150\nhave that availability right then and\nthere, I can do that.\n\n496\n00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,445\nI don't have to be a master of database\ndesign or even the hardware, right?\n\n497\n00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:08,280\nCuz we come from the hardware area\nwhere I gotta actually buy that stuff,\n\n498\n00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,410\nI gotta implement it,\nI gotta stick it in a server rack.\n\n499\n00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,030\nI gotta connect it all to the network,\ncreate firewall rules, all that business.\n\n500\n00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,220\nNot here, there it's just super easy.\n\n501\n00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,028\nThis is really the way to go for database.\n\n502\n00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,630\n>> Yeah, especially if you're\nlike an internet startup and\n\n503\n00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,311\nyou've hired your web developers cuz you\nknow your website is really important.\n\n504\n00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:28,220\nYou haven't hired any DBAs, you're not big\nenough to have database administrator yet.\n\n505\n00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220\nYou don't wanna deal\nwith that administration.\n\n506\n00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,670\nLet Amazon take care of it for you.\n\n507\n00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,230\nHost it right there, spins up.\n\n508\n00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,510\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n509\n00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,460\nAnd if you have problems with it.\n\n510\n00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,440\nThe best part?\n\n511\n00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,000\nJust get on the phone and call Amazon.\n\n512\n00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,580\nOr do an email,\nsupport ticket, or whatever.\n\n513\n00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,870\nHey, my database is running slow.\n\n514\n00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,420\nCan you look at it?\n\n515\n00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,400\nAnd they'll actually look at it and\nthey'll say well,\n\n516\n00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600\nyou're exceeding your IO's.\n\n517\n00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,380\nWe need to bump you up to this.\n\n518\n00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,210\nWhat we'd really recommend instead\nof doing general purpose SSDE,\n\n519\n00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,260\nmove over to the provisioned IOPS,\nyou know.\n\n520\n00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,310\nYou've got that option and\nthey'll help you, they'll manage it.\n\n521\n00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,520\nIt really does make sense.\n\n522\n00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,640\nNow, the cost for this is a little\nmore than setting up your own server.\n\n523\n00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,060\nYou normally have, like,\nthe EC2 instances that you spin up.\n\n524\n00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,050\nHere you're paying more\nbecause the management, right?\n\n525\n00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,450\nSo, for example, you might pay $0.08\nan hour, or $0.20 an hour, or whatever.\n\n526\n00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,840\nFor an EC2 instance you might pay $0.30 or\n$0.34 an hour for\n\n527\n00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,660\nthat database instance,\nit's more expensive.\n\n528\n00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,710\nBut the tradeoff is you get management\nout of it, you get support,\n\n529\n00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,720\nyou get redundancy, automated backups,\nit really is a great, great service.\n\n530\n00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,680\n>> Yeah, I wouldn't mind letting somebody\nelse handle that job, that's for sure.\n\n531\n00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,570\nSo you need a database, not a problem.\n\n532\n00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,910\nLet me get that whipped up for\n\n533\n00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,810\nyou real quick and\nnot have to go through all that process.\n\n534\n00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n535\n00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,310\n>> All right, Don,\nhave we covered the Amazon database?\n\n536\n00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,490\n>> Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n537\n00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,170\n>> Awesome.\nIt was great stuff.\n\n538\n00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,000\nI really enjoyed it.\n\n539\n00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,360\nI hope you guys did as well.\n\n540\n00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,620\nThat being said, I guess we've come to the\nend of another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n541\n00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,830\nI've been you're host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n542\n00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,490\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n543\n00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,790\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:15,860\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,720\nHere with me today is my\ngood friend Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,920\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,110\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel, and\nI'm excited about this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,660\nBecause we get to talk about\none of the technologies that\n\n8\n00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,310\nreally makes the cloud useful.\n\n9\n00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,530\nThere's a lot of people out there that\nstill haven't moved any technologies into\n\n10\n00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,970\nthe cloud, and I can understand that.\n\n11\n00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,830\nIt's not really a necessity for everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,400\nCertain people need access to that.\n\n13\n00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,215\nCertain people can really benefit from it.\n\n14\n00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,995\nAnd one of the best ways to benefit\n\n15\n00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:43,865\nis through use of a feature\ncalled auto-scaling.\n\n16\n00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:46,385\nAnd all the major cloud\nproviders provide this service.\n\n17\n00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,715\nThey give it different names, but\n\n18\n00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,285\nmost of them do actually\nrefer to it as auto-scaling.\n\n19\n00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:53,762\nAnd it's the the ability\nto instantaneously spin up\n\n20\n00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,212\nnew servers when you need them, and cut\nout old servers when you don't need them.\n\n21\n00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,812\nAnd it's really where you get\nto truly take advantage of\n\n22\n00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:01,142\nwhat the cloud has to offer.\n\n23\n00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:04,162\n>> Yeah that is definitely a great\nfeature to be able to say,\n\n24\n00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:07,962\nI can customize my servers and\neverything on the fly.\n\n25\n00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,582\nTo be able to say well,\nI don't need these servers right now.\n\n26\n00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:13,400\nI mean just go ahead and decommission\nthem for as long as I need that.\n\n27\n00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,810\nIf I need them back, I spin them back up.\n\n28\n00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,600\nI need new stuff, spin that up.\n\n29\n00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,430\nI'm good to go.\n\n30\n00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,860\nThis is probably one of the biggest\nselling points, I would say,\n\n31\n00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,960\nabout the cloud features.\n\n32\n00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,550\nSo let's start with that concept of\nAuto Scaling and how that works.\n\n34\n00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,450\nThen we'll see how to actually implement\nit in something like Amazon Web Services.\n\n35\n00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,700\nSo, in a normal data farm.\n\n36\n00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,950\nLet's say you're building up a web farm,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,140\nYou've got to have a website up for\nyour customers.\n\n38\n00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,780\nAnd most people don't have\na standard linear usage number.\n\n39\n00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,870\nLike, your servers don't run at 80%\npercent CPU utilization all day long.\n\n40\n00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,478\nInstead, they have peaks and valleys.\n\n41\n00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,723\nSo let me show you a diagram that I\nmade here that kind of represents\n\n42\n00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,090\nwhat a website might normally experience.\n\n43\n00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,060\nSo here's midnight and\nwe go to 6 A.M. and noon and\n\n44\n00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,200\n6 P.M., and apparently we have\nmultiple 0600 hours here.\n\n45\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,730\nSo that would be midnight again.\n\n46\n00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,040\nSo anyhow, we have a time\nscale kind of laid out here.\n\n47\n00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,460\nAnd traffic on our website\nmight peak at certain times,\n\n48\n00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,570\nlike right here around 5 AM.\n\n49\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,880\nAnd that might plummet to\na really low utilization and\n\n50\n00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840\nthen in the afternoon it peaks again.\n\n51\n00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,250\nYour website may have\nwidely different numbers.\n\n52\n00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,240\nBut the odds are it looks\nsomething like this,\n\n53\n00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,400\nnot just a straight line where you\nhave steady usage all day long.\n\n54\n00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,240\nOn a public Internet facing site,\nyou have people coming from all sorts\n\n55\n00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,960\nof time zones, and\nyou'll have different usage levels.\n\n56\n00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,910\nWell, if I knew that at peak times,\n\n57\n00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,149\nI needed ten servers to be able to\nsupport the load of my peak utilization.\n\n58\n00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,490\nBut when it's down here in a valley,\n\n59\n00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,630\nI knew that I only needed two\nservers to carry that load.\n\n60\n00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,050\nIf I'm going to build out my own web farm\nwith my own servers in my own building,\n\n61\n00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,070\nhow many servers do I have to buy?\n\n62\n00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,600\nGotta buy 10.\n\n63\n00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,590\nYou have to have 10 servers\nto support your peak load.\n\n64\n00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,480\nAnd that way when the site is busy\nyou can handle that throughput.\n\n65\n00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,080\nBut when the site gets slow,\n\n66\n00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,350\nand you're down here where you only\nreally need two servers, what do you do?\n\n67\n00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,960\nWell, you bought those ten servers.\n\n68\n00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,850\nYou've got the ten servers all the time.\n\n69\n00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,030\nAnd so here in the valley,\n\n70\n00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,680\nyou got eight servers that are sitting\nthere doing nothing, they're just waiting.\n\n71\n00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,360\nBut you have to have them because\nwhen you own your own equipment,\n\n72\n00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,420\nwhen you buy your servers and\nyou and own them.\n\n73\n00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,340\nYou've gotta plan to support your peak\ntime, your highest load of traffic.\n\n74\n00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,840\nWith the cloud, we don't have to do that.\n\n75\n00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,190\nWith the cloud, we pay for what we use.\n\n76\n00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,480\nWe can say I need this\namount of servers at 6 AM,\n\n77\n00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,910\nI need this other amount of servers or\n2 AM.\n\n78\n00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,840\nWell, can we predict when\nour peak load is gonna be?\n\n79\n00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,150\nA great example is would be like\nif your website goes viral.\n\n80\n00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,845\nSo, so maybe Daniel creates a video of\nhim washing a car with an elephant.\n\n81\n00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, as you know,\n\n82\n00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,220\nyou got the elephant trunks spraying\nthe car down, it was really hilarious.\n\n83\n00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,210\nWebsite goes viral, right?\n\n84\n00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,150\nSo, I'm getting tons of\nhits on the website.\n\n85\n00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,850\nWell, yesterday I might have\nonly need the three servers.\n\n86\n00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,610\nAnd now today,\n\n87\n00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,210\nI need 300 servers to be able to handle\nall the people that are hitting that site.\n\n88\n00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,570\nAnd if it were physical servers,\nI'd go and buy them.\n\n89\n00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,020\nAnd you wait for them to ship over and\n\n90\n00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,820\nbe delivered, and\nget the OSs installed and set up.\n\n91\n00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,470\nIt's a huge delay in our ability\nto respond to growing capacity\n\n92\n00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,450\nin physical servers.\n\n93\n00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,280\nBut with the cloud, I just dial it up.\n\n95\n00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,390\nWith the cloud we can do auto scaling.\n\n96\n00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,820\nAnd we can say, when I'm at my peak time,\nI only need 10 servers.\n\n97\n00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,110\nAnd when I'm in a valley, go ahead and\ndelete eight of those servers.\n\n98\n00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,040\nJust delete them outright.\n\n99\n00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,570\nThrow them in the trash, right?\n\n100\n00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,900\nI don't need those, I only need two.\n\n101\n00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,630\nAnd now, I'm only paying for two.\n\n102\n00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,810\nAnd then, as my site starts to get busy,\nwe can ramp up.\n\n103\n00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,170\nMaybe I go to 7 servers and then we ramp\nup to 10 servers to support the load.\n\n104\n00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,860\nAnd we keep climbing just like that.\n\n105\n00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,970\nSo that's one of the big advantages\nof doing something like auto scaling.\n\n106\n00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,680\nYou only have the amount of servers you\nneed at the time that you need them,\n\n107\n00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,510\nand if your site goes viral, right?\n\n108\n00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,770\nLet's say that, boy, that Daniel washing\nthe elephant commercial or whatever.\n\n109\n00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,530\nJust really does become this\nhuge internet sensation and\n\n110\n00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,910\nso our traffic,\nmy little lines gonna go crazy here.\n\n111\n00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,380\nThat internet traffic takes one\nof these huge arc curves and\n\n112\n00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,450\njust starts going straight\nup through the roof.\n\n113\n00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,360\nWell, we don't have to\nworry about that either.\n\n114\n00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,116\nSo maybe normally my peak\ntime would be 10 servers, but\n\n115\n00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,290\nwith auto scaling I can set\nit to say you know what?\n\n116\n00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,980\nGo ahead and scale to 20 servers,\n30 servers 300 servers.\n\n117\n00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,005\nHow ever many it is I need to be able to\nsupport that load, you can set it up.\n\n118\n00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,775\n>> Right.\n>> Now, you can do this manually.\n\n119\n00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,175\nYou can go and manually tell\nit how many servers you want.\n\n120\n00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,885\nBut what if it happens in the middle\nof the night while you're asleep?\n\n121\n00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,295\nWe want this to be automatic.\n\n122\n00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,025\nAnd that's what auto scaling is all about.\n\n123\n00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,105\nHaving the system automatically\nmonitor and grow and\n\n124\n00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,645\nshrink your data farm based on your needs.\n\n125\n00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:45,725\n>> Now, when they do the auto scaling,\nyou say,\n\n126\n00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,700\nI want 30 servers, or I want 300 servers,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n127\n00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,670\nThey also do that with\nthe pay rate as well.\n\n128\n00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,450\nSo you don't have to try to say, oh,\nhow much am I going to be paying for this?\n\n129\n00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,790\nOr how much am I gonna be paying for that?\n\n130\n00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,990\nEverything's auto setup, so\njust adjust your bill as it's necessary.\n\n131\n00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,740\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n132\n00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,170\nYeah, with physical servers, you gotta buy\nthem and have been there all the time.\n\n133\n00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,760\nSo that's a huge upfront cost and\nthen your run cost,\n\n134\n00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200\nof electricity and all that.\n\n135\n00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,190\nWith auto scaling you just set\nyour parameters, set your limits.\n\n136\n00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,530\nAnd yeah, when you spit up the ten\nservers, you gotta pay for it.\n\n137\n00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,550\nBut you know what?\n\n138\n00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,430\nYour customer base has increased,\n\n139\n00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,450\nwhich means your revenue should increase,\nwhich means it pays for itself, right?\n\n140\n00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,100\nSo it really is one of the best\nreasons to go to the cloud.\n\n141\n00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,730\nIf you moved servers into the cloud, and\nyou're not doing auto scaling somewhere.\n\n142\n00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,900\nThen, I don't want to do too\nbig of a generalization, but\n\n143\n00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,670\nbasically you're not doing it right.\n\n144\n00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,120\nAnd this is the biggest\nadvantage to having it there.\n\n145\n00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120\nThere's other advantages\nto having a single server.\n\n146\n00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,870\nYou know, like the redundant data\ncenters and all that other stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,460\nBut auto scaling is where we truly save\nmoney, and create a data center that\n\n148\n00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,270\ncan scale to handle millions\nof users on a moment's notice.\n\n149\n00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,240\nAnd that's something we\ncouldn't normally do.\n\n150\n00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,470\nAll of the big Internet startups started\nthis way, companies like Twitter, right?\n\n151\n00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,730\nAnd Digg, and other web sites.\n\n152\n00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,240\nThat in the beginning only\nhad a few hundred users,\n\n153\n00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,850\nnow they have billions of users.\n\n154\n00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,314\nThat might be a bit excessive.\n\n155\n00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,840\nBut worth billions of dollars if\nnothing else, could they need that?\n\n156\n00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,130\nSo let's take a look at how this works.\n\n157\n00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,230\nNow, I want to show you\nan example of doing autoscaling.\n\n158\n00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,160\nWe're going to do\nan Amazon Web Services inside EC2.\n\n159\n00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,440\nBut instead of jumping\nstraight into auto scaling.\n\n160\n00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,000\nThe first thing that I wanna show you\nguys is the elastic load balancer.\n\n161\n00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,630\nAuto scaling starts with a load balancer.\n\n162\n00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,100\nThe problem we have is if\nI have one web server,\n\n163\n00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,320\nall my users go to that one web server.\n\n164\n00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,730\nIf I scale it up and\nI have ten web servers,\n\n165\n00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,220\nhow many users know to be distributed\nacross all 10 of those servers?\n\n166\n00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,430\nThey don't, right.\n\n167\n00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,330\nThey all go that one server.\n\n168\n00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,700\nSo auto scaling is not\nterribly effective by itself.\n\n169\n00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,310\nBut we combine it with a load balancer.\n\n170\n00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,420\nAnd the load balancer says I gonna balance\nthe load across these two servers.\n\n171\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,300\nAnd we just grew by another, and\nanother, now I got four servers.\n\n172\n00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,320\nI'll bounce the load across all four.\n\n173\n00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,260\nSo the load balancer is kind of a key\npiece, and that's where we start.\n\n174\n00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,269\nAnd if you haven't worked with load\nbalancing It's just really simple.\n\n175\n00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,123\nAll of your Internet traffic is sent to\na load balancer instead of being sent to\n\n176\n00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,143\na specific server.\n\n177\n00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:02,083\nAnd then the load balancer will\nforward that traffic along\n\n178\n00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,463\nto servers on the back end.\n\n179\n00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:06,204\nBased on any number of\ncriteria that we can define.\n\n180\n00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:09,374\nIf you haven't watched it yet,\nwe filmed an episode on load balancing and\n\n181\n00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,050\nhow to do that.\n\n182\n00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,460\nSo, definitely check that episode out.\n\n183\n00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,820\nAnd you'll get a chance to see\nload balancing in action there.\n\n184\n00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,310\nBut for our auto scaling,\nwe've got to have this.\n\n185\n00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,150\nSo that as we grow servers, they're\nautomatically added to the load balancer\n\n186\n00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,530\nand the traffic is\nautomatically forwarded along.\n\n187\n00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,220\nSo that's where I'm gonna start.\n\n188\n00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,710\nI'm going to go into my Amazon Web\nServices console, and I'll go into EC2,\n\n189\n00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,590\nand the temptation with setting\nthis up is if we scroll down,\n\n190\n00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,975\nwe can jump right into auto scaling.\n\n191\n00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:34,520\nRight.\nBut\n\n192\n00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,438\nI'm going to start up here\nwith a load balancer.\n\n193\n00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:40,965\nSo, I'm gonna come up here and do Network\nand Security and Load Balancers, and\n\n194\n00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,645\nI'm just gonna whip up a load\nbalancer real quick, all right?\n\n195\n00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:48,215\nNow, when I go to create my load balancer,\nit's just gonna ask a few basic questions.\n\n196\n00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:49,145\nI need to give it a name.\n\n197\n00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,115\nI'll call this one my itprotv-demoweb.\n\n198\n00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:57,755\nSo this is gonna be my web farm, and\nI'll create just in my default network.\n\n199\n00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,615\nYou can create, like,\ninternal load bouncers and stuff.\n\n200\n00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:01,430\nI'm not going to mess with any of that.\n\n201\n00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,350\nI'm going to load balance for\n\n202\n00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,900\nweb traffic because this is gonna\nbe an Internet website server.\n\n203\n00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,710\nIf it was something else that we were load\nbalancing, like a database or whatever,\n\n204\n00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,810\nyou'd have to add those\nports here as a listener.\n\n205\n00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,555\nBut I'll leave it like this, then,\nwe can set our security group.\n\n206\n00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,240\nYou'll control what access people have for\nthis load balancer.\n\n207\n00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,320\nI've already got a security\ngroup defined for\n\n208\n00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,850\nwebsite which just allows anybody on the\nInternet to access this server on port 80.\n\n209\n00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,990\nThat's what I want.\n\n210\n00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,430\nAll right.\n\n211\n00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,410\nThen, we can configure any\nother security settings.\n\n212\n00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,590\nWe don't really have any other ones here,\nso I'm just gonna hit Next, and\n\n213\n00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,490\nthen our Health Check.\n\n214\n00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,180\nYou know,\nhow it knows if a node is down or up.\n\n215\n00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,670\nThese are websites, so it's just going\nto query index.html every five seconds.\n\n216\n00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,090\nIf it doesn't get a response back\nfrom a server, it assumes it's down.\n\n217\n00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,370\nIt takes it out of the load balancer.\n\n218\n00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,970\nSo that's kind of what you want.\n\n219\n00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,060\nSo we'll leave those at the default.\n\n220\n00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,210\nAnd lastly it's gonna ask what servers\nare gonna go into my load balancer.\n\n221\n00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,960\nNow I've already got a web server\ncreated but it's not really part of my\n\n222\n00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,320\nauto scaling group so I'll have to\nsort that out a little bit later.\n\n223\n00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,020\nSo I could select that one, or\nI could just leave it empty for right now,\n\n224\n00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,820\nit's kind of up to me.\n\n225\n00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,550\nI'll leave it empty, all right,\n\n226\n00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,740\nthen we can set any other keys and\ntags we need, I don't need those.\n\n227\n00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,240\nAll right, so here's my load balancer,\nI'll get that created, and\n\n228\n00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,920\nnow I've got a load balancer in place.\n\n229\n00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,060\nNow the load balancer is empty,\nso it's not very useful, is it?\n\n230\n00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,940\nI'm load balancing across no servers.\n\n231\n00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,950\nHere's where auto scaling comes in.\n\n232\n00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,430\nI need to create an auto scaling group\nthat can populate that load balancer with\n\n233\n00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,870\nservers, and they can grow and\nshrink based on the demands of my server.\n\n234\n00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,430\nSo I need to start by creating an AMI.\n\n235\n00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,520\nWhen I say that we're\ngonna clone these servers,\n\n236\n00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,870\nif it's going to spin up a server,\nwell think about it.\n\n237\n00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,400\nI don't just need a blank server.\n\n238\n00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,160\nIf this is a website I need\nthat server to already have\n\n239\n00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,840\na copy of my web pages on it, right?\n\n240\n00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,690\nIt needs to be running a web server,\nit needs to be configured properly.\n\n241\n00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,480\nI got a little bit of work to do.\n\n242\n00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,090\nSo I need to create an Amazon machine\nimage that is already set up for my needs.\n\n243\n00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,691\nIt's already set up as a web server, and\n\n244\n00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,230\nit has my site and it has my permissions\nand all those other settings in place.\n\n245\n00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,750\nSo that's why I created\nthis instance up here.\n\n246\n00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,180\nI created a web server, and\nI set it up exactly how I want it.\n\n247\n00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,410\nI installed Apache, I created a sample web\npage on it, so I got it up and running.\n\n248\n00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,905\nThis is set up exactly how I'd want\none of my web nodes to be, all right?\n\n249\n00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:20,640\nThen I can turn that into an Amazon\nmachine image, an AMI, and\n\n250\n00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,347\nI can use that to clone into my auto\nscaling group on a as-needed basis.\n\n251\n00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:28,090\nSo I'm gonna take this guy right here and\n\n252\n00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,420\nI'm gonna basically\nconvert it into an image.\n\n253\n00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,390\nNow when you build an AMI, you're really\nnot building it off of the running server.\n\n254\n00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,140\nYou're building it off of\nthe server's hard drive.\n\n255\n00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,580\nSo that's really all you're cloning.\n\n256\n00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,780\nSo I can create the image from right here.\n\n257\n00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,760\nI'm on the instance.\n\n258\n00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,860\nI go to Action > Image > Create Image,\nor I could go to my volume list.\n\n259\n00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,380\nAnd I could find the volume, and\nI could create the AMI from there, too.\n\n260\n00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,150\nSo, either way it's the same result.\n\n261\n00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,290\n>> Now, quick question, Don.\n\n262\n00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,620\nWith the images that you create.\n\n263\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,950\nSo we're gonna go through this.\n\n264\n00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,510\nWe're gonna put in the operating system,\nand\n\n265\n00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,470\nthe other services that we need\nto have installed, as well.\n\n266\n00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,190\nIf later, after we've created that image,\nwe make a change,\n\n267\n00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,600\ndo we then need to delete the old\nimage and recreate a new one, or\n\n268\n00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,060\ndoes it auto actually see\nthat there's changes made?\n\n269\n00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,570\n>> No, you do have to recreate the image.\n\n270\n00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,190\nSo you basically do like planned rollouts.\n\n271\n00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,680\nSo as you start to update your\nwebsite from your content,\n\n272\n00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,470\nyou gotta push that over.\n\n273\n00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,180\nNow If you don't want to do that,\nthere's ways around it.\n\n274\n00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,080\nFor example,\nI could build up this server so\n\n275\n00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,080\nthat the first time it boots, it doesn't\nR sync to like, an S3 storage repository.\n\n276\n00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,100\nIt gets the latest copy of the website.\n\n277\n00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,040\nAnd now,\nevery time one of these servers spins up,\n\n278\n00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,940\nit reaches out and\ngets the latest copy of the website.\n\n279\n00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,570\nOr if you're running\na server like WordPress or\n\n280\n00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,680\nsomething where all of your data\nis stored in a database anyway,\n\n281\n00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,480\nthe web server doesn't really get updated.\n\n282\n00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800\nIt's reaching out to that database.\n\n283\n00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,410\nI mean, you might have updates\nto go the website, but\n\n284\n00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,330\nyou push those out in a rollout.\n\n285\n00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,810\nSo, there's ways to get around that,\n\n286\n00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,830\nwhere you're not having\nto rebuild the AMI image.\n\n287\n00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,830\nBut if you do something as\nsimple as system updates.\n\n288\n00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,290\nRight?\nSo a new update.\n\n289\n00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,550\nThis is a CentOS image here.\n\n290\n00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,440\nSo an update comes out for CentOS.\n\n291\n00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,030\nWell I can apply that to my\ncurrently running AMI, or\n\n292\n00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,060\nmy currently running instances.\n\n293\n00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,520\nBut when they get deleted and\n\n294\n00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,490\nnew ones spin up they are not\ngonna have those updates.\n\n295\n00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,180\nSo you gotta update the AMI,\nand you gotta push that out.\n\n296\n00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,620\nOr you've got a script it in to that\nfirst time the machine boots to have it\n\n297\n00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,960\nautomatically do updates and so\non, but all that creates a delay.\n\n298\n00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,610\nThe more stuff you put in for\n\n299\n00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,010\nit to do before it comes live,\nthe longer it takes you to respond.\n\n300\n00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,431\nRemember my diagram that I brought up.\n\n301\n00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,091\nWhere'd my diagram go?\n\n302\n00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:28,780\nHere, my little diagram that I showed.\n\n303\n00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,840\nSee how I had that response was happening\nin line with the traffic, right?\n\n304\n00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,570\nSo as traffic went, we responded in line.\n\n305\n00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,350\nThe more stuff those instances have to do\nto get ready, the more likely it's gonna\n\n306\n00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,170\nlook more like this, where we're\nkinda trailing our actual load.\n\n307\n00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,560\nThe system gets busy.\n\n308\n00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,540\nWe fire up the AMIs, but\nthey take time to get ready, and we're not\n\n309\n00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,280\nactually operating at peak level until\nafter the peak level started to decline,\n\n310\n00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,620\nso we wanna try and\nkeep that to a minimum.\n\n311\n00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,550\n>> Cool?\n>> All right, so\n\n312\n00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,840\nwhen I go to create my image,\nI just need to give it a name.\n\n313\n00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,300\nI'll call this one itprotv-demoweb.\n\n314\n00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:12,710\nAnd give it a description, I'll call\nthis my Base AMI for auto scaling group.\n\n315\n00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,310\nAnd we set some basic information here.\n\n316\n00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,170\nThe storage,\nI'm not gonna manipulate any of this.\n\n317\n00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,160\nIt's pulling this data from the server,\nthe instance that I'm cloning, so\n\n318\n00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,840\nI don't really need to\nmanipulate that much at all.\n\n319\n00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,010\nSo we'll just create that, and\nit's gonna build that image.\n\n320\n00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,020\nSo when I go down here to AMIs, I can\nsee it's building that image, all right?\n\n321\n00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,720\nNow I need to create what's\ncalled a launch configuration.\n\n322\n00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,610\nAs it spins up new nodes in\nmy my auto scaling cluster,\n\n323\n00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,240\nit has to have a configuration to apply.\n\n324\n00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,390\nAnd the configuration\ntells it what AMI to use.\n\n325\n00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,220\nAnd I can change the amount of memory it\ngets and other things like that, too.\n\n326\n00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,930\nSo, the launch configuration\nis the next part.\n\n327\n00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,750\nNow In our menu over here, you'll notice\nunder Auto Scaling there's two menu items.\n\n328\n00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,640\nThere's Launch Configurations and\nAuto Scaling Groups.\n\n329\n00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,790\nIf this is your first time setting it up,\n\n330\n00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,680\nit doesn't really matter\nwhich one you go to.\n\n331\n00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,540\nIf you go to either one, it's gonna take\nyou to the Welcome Auto Scaling wizard.\n\n332\n00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,580\nAnd see how it's the same\non both of those?\n\n333\n00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,610\nBut after you've created your first one,\nfrom then on you need to\n\n334\n00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,180\ngo to Launch Configurations first and\ncreate a launch configuration.\n\n335\n00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,370\nOnce you've got that,\nthen you define the auto scaling group and\n\n336\n00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,590\ntell it which launch configuration to use.\n\n337\n00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,370\nWell, when we use our wizard here\nit's actually going to both for\n\n338\n00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,210\nus at the same time.\n\n339\n00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,133\nSo I'll hit Create\nthe Auto Scaling Group and\n\n340\n00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,615\nnow I'm gonna walk through this wizard.\n\n341\n00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:29,425\nSo the first thing it's gonna do is\ncreate that launch configuration,\n\n342\n00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,135\nthat's what we need.\n\n343\n00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:34,423\nAnd it's gonna ask us\nwhat AMI we're gonna use.\n\n344\n00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,815\nNow we could use any of\nthe built in Amazon ones, but\n\n345\n00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:38,805\nwhen they come up what do they have?\n\n346\n00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,955\nBased operating system, none of my stuff.\n\n347\n00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:45,580\nSo that's not really suitable, it's not\nsomething really anybody's gonna use,\n\n348\n00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,600\nI don't know why it's the default.\n\n349\n00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,270\nBut we'll go here to My AMIs and\n\n350\n00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,310\nhere I'll see a list of all of the Amazon\nmachine images that I've made.\n\n351\n00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,200\nAnd there's my demo web\nserver right there.\n\n352\n00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,494\nI'll go ahead and select that one.\n\n353\n00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:59,426\nNow I can change the hardware level,\nI built that as a t2 micro,\n\n354\n00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,648\nI could bump that up to something\nhigher if I wanted to, it's up to me.\n\n355\n00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:05,368\nI'll leave it at micro.\n\n356\n00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:06,200\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,034\nOn the next screen I need to give\nthe launch configuration a name,\n\n358\n00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:12,650\nso I'll just call mine itprotv-demoweb.\n\n359\n00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,030\nI can leave it at that or do dash like,\nLC for launch configuration.\n\n360\n00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,920\nWhatever you wanted call it.\n\n361\n00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,990\nYou can do spot instances.\n\n362\n00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,910\nSpot instances say,\n\n363\n00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,830\nlike, if there's extra server space\navailable in EC2 go ahead and use it.\n\n364\n00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,860\nIf not, wait.\n\n365\n00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,070\nYou save money that way,\n\n366\n00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,480\nbut you don't have guaranteed response\ntime for bringing up the instances.\n\n367\n00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,230\nI don't want to do that, all right.\n\n368\n00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,510\nYou can also do, like, IAM roles for\nadvanced security and monitoring.\n\n369\n00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,890\nWe've got other shows that cover those,\nso I'm just gonna leave those out for\n\n370\n00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,200\nright now.\n\n371\n00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800\nNow, one important thing is,\nwhen you go through and\n\n372\n00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,590\nconfigure these options, we're going to\nsee a few screens like this where there's\n\n373\n00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,880\nan Advanced Details button\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n374\n00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,100\nAnd that shows other things\nthat you might wanna tweak and\n\n375\n00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,670\nmost of this stuff we don't have\nto mess with too much, right?\n\n376\n00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,830\nIt's all fairly simple, but\nwe'll see a little bit later\n\n377\n00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,620\nwhere there is one spot where we\nneed to go into Advanced Details,\n\n378\n00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,400\nto set which load balancer\nwe're gonna use, all right.\n\n379\n00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,010\nOkay, so\nI've got my launch configuration names.\n\n380\n00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,610\nI can modify the storage if I want.\n\n381\n00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,170\nThis instance has eight gigs, that's\nmore than enough for a web server, so\n\n382\n00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,870\nI'll leave that be.\n\n383\n00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,560\nAnd then we've got our security group, and\nit wants to set its own security group,\n\n384\n00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,550\nand that may be fine.\n\n385\n00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,410\nI've already got one made, though,\nfor web servers specifically,\n\n386\n00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,400\nand this is all website access, so\nI'll go ahead and just throw in that,\n\n387\n00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,020\nand that'll give me that protection.\n\n388\n00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,990\nSo see, I've got SSH and HTTP enabled.\n\n389\n00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,110\nOnce that's done, that gives me my little\noverview of the launch configuration.\n\n390\n00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,950\nAnd we're ready to rock.\n\n391\n00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,410\nSo we'll go ahead and\ncreate that launch configuration.\n\n392\n00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,490\nAnd now it's gonna ask for a key pair.\n\n393\n00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,460\nAs it spins up these VMS,\nif I want to remote and connect into them,\n\n394\n00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,930\nI have to have credentials.\n\n395\n00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,490\nAnd so it's offering to create a new,\nor I can create a new key pair.\n\n396\n00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,090\nI've already got an existing one called\nITProTV Web, I'll stick with that one.\n\n397\n00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:59,310\nAll right,\nnow I've got my launch configuration done.\n\n398\n00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,370\nNext is the auto scaling group.\n\n399\n00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,870\nThe auto scaling group is where I tell it\nhow to monitor the system to know when\n\n400\n00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,800\nthe spin up servers,\nwhen it's time to spin up a server where\n\n401\n00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,780\nit gets that image from, and then when\nit's time to remove servers, right.\n\n402\n00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,800\nThis is the real important part.\n\n403\n00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,720\nSo we go here,\nwe give it a group name, and\n\n404\n00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,834\nI'll just call this one itprotv-demoweb.\n\n405\n00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,340\nAnd the group size.\n\n406\n00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,090\nStart with one instance.\n\n407\n00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,420\nAll right?\nThis is like setting our minimum.\n\n408\n00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,920\nNow, you will see another spot where we\ncan override this a little bit later, but\n\n409\n00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,320\nI'm saying if I want this to be\nfunctional I need at least one server.\n\n410\n00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160\n>> That kind of defeats\nthe purpose if you don't [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,550\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n412\n00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,080\nAnd you might do it if you're just trying\nto set things up in the beginning, but,\n\n413\n00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,440\nI'll set it with one.\n\n414\n00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,220\nI might want two instances by default.\n\n415\n00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,620\nIt's up to me.\n\n416\n00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,350\nThe network that it's going to be on,\nI'll stick with my default VPC.\n\n417\n00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,630\nI do need to specify a subnet, and\nthe subnet is how it's determining what\n\n418\n00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,060\nregion inside of that availability\nthat it's going to put this in.\n\n419\n00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,765\nAnd so I'm gonna to US East 1A.\n\n420\n00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:08,940\nYou can do a auto-scaling group where the\nnodes are in different zones if you want.\n\n421\n00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,520\nIf you put them in different availability\nzones and one of Amazon's data centers\n\n422\n00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,070\ngoes down, you've got nodes in the other\nzone, so it helps to build redundancy.\n\n423\n00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,720\nIt's a good idea, and so\nyou can see I can keep going in and\n\n424\n00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400\nadding more if I want to.\n\n425\n00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,721\nI'm just gonna stick with US 1a.\n\n426\n00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,680\nAll right.\n\n427\n00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,710\nUnder Advanced Details though, this is one\nof those screens where if I hit Next I'm\n\n428\n00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,430\ngonna lose the ability to add\nmy load balancer to this, and\n\n429\n00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,850\nyou'll have to do it from the command\nline, which is a lot more difficult.\n\n430\n00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,520\nSo I need to go here to Advanced Details,\nand right here we can tell it\n\n431\n00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,170\nTo receive traffic from an ELB,\nfrom Elastic Load Balancer.\n\n432\n00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,860\nAnd we can tell it which load\nbalancer we want to use.\n\n433\n00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,610\nAll right.\n\n434\n00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,530\nThat's pretty important.\n\n435\n00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,130\nWe need to set that.\n\n436\n00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,120\nThe other thing is,\nwe can tell it a health check to use.\n\n437\n00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,210\nAnd it normally uses EC2's health check,\nwhich just checks to make sure that\n\n438\n00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,840\nthe virtual machine is on and\nthat it's responding.\n\n439\n00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,880\nBut we can tell it to use\nthe ELB health check.\n\n440\n00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,700\nThat one's also going to check\nwhether the website is responding.\n\n441\n00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,620\nAnd that's good because if I say\nI need a minimum of one node and\n\n442\n00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,170\nthat one node's not responding,\nI need to spin off a second node, right?\n\n443\n00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,940\nSo I wanna change it over\nto use that other check.\n\n444\n00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,920\nAll right.\n\n445\n00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,410\nOn my next screen, I've got keep\nthis group at its initial size, and\n\n446\n00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,670\nthat'll be a manual scaling group.\n\n447\n00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,230\nI can manually scale it larger or\nsmaller, it's up to me.\n\n448\n00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,950\nBut kind of the whole purpose of\nauto scaling's that it's automatic,\n\n449\n00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,710\nso I'm gonna chose to set a policy.\n\n450\n00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,930\nAnd here's where we set the minimum,\nthe maximum, and\n\n451\n00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,050\nas well as the rules for\nhow to go up and how to go down.\n\n452\n00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,569\nSo I'm gonna set my minimum to 1,\nI'll set my maximum to 10.\n\n453\n00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:40,485\nNow, just a word on the side here.\n\n454\n00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:43,765\nIf you set up your own\npersonal Amazon account,\n\n455\n00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:47,125\na lot of accounts are capped\nat 20 instances by default.\n\n456\n00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,435\nMost people don't realize that cuz\nthey don't spin up more than that.\n\n457\n00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:50,595\nBut if you're gonna auto scale and\n\n458\n00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:54,375\ngo larger, then you actually need to\nopen up a support ticket with Amazon and\n\n459\n00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,465\nlet them know you want to remove\nthat cap and move the cap higher.\n\n460\n00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,825\nAnd they can move it higher.\n\n461\n00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,360\nRight.\nThey do that as a protection mechanism.\n\n462\n00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,100\nIf somebody were to hack into my account,\n\n463\n00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,560\nI wouldn't want them to spin up 100\ninstances and start doing Bitcoin mining.\n\n464\n00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,140\nBecause I'm gonna pay for that.\n\n465\n00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,630\nSo that's why that limit is there.\n\n466\n00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,920\nIt's a good thing to have.\n\n467\n00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,520\nAnd it's just a quick support ticket\nwith Amazon, it'll lift that limit.\n\n468\n00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,060\nIt takes maybe an hour.\n\n469\n00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,920\n>> Now, Don, when you create these\ninstances where it says that you can have\n\n470\n00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,150\nthis auto scaling, is it better to\ngo with, like, better machines or\n\n471\n00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,440\nmore machines, or both?\n\n472\n00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560\nWhat would we do there?\n\n473\n00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,720\n>> It depends on how much\nyour traffic fluctuates.\n\n474\n00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,390\nOkay, if your load on the servers\nis fairly stable, sure,\n\n475\n00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,285\nyou've got peaks and valleys, but for\nthe most part, it's kind of fairly stable,\n\n476\n00:21:38,285 --> 00:21:42,545\nthen having larger machines means\nyou'll auto scale less often.\n\n477\n00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:45,975\nSo you'll spin up servers less often,\ncuz your servers are beefier.\n\n478\n00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:50,605\nBut if you've got wide variations, right,\nwhere it spikes and it's hugely different\n\n479\n00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:53,985\nfrom when you're in a valley, in that\ncase you go with smaller servers, right?\n\n480\n00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:55,545\nServers with less RAM or less CPU.\n\n481\n00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:59,305\nYou're able to scale more granularly.\n\n482\n00:21:59,305 --> 00:21:59,815\nRight?\n\n483\n00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:05,510\nSo, it's kind of up to you whether you\nwant Less scaling or more scaling.\n\n484\n00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,490\nIf you have that heavier hardware,\neach time you add a server,\n\n485\n00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,050\nyou're adding far more capacity.\n\n486\n00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,280\nBut you're paying more for it.\n\n487\n00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,690\nSo it's kind of finding that balance\nbetween capacity and cost and\n\n488\n00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,000\nwhat you want to respond with.\n\n489\n00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,720\n>> Gotcha.\n\n490\n00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,910\n>> Yep.\n\n491\n00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,330\nAll right, so I'm gonna set my max at ten.\n\n492\n00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,760\nSo on a scale between one and ten servers\ndown here I've got an increase group size\n\n493\n00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,810\nrule and a decrease group size rule.\n\n494\n00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,250\nAnd here's how we're going to tell\nit when to increase or decrease.\n\n495\n00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,610\nAt a minimum you need to add an alarm.\n\n496\n00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,440\nAnd that's how it's going to\nmonitor a no win increase.\n\n497\n00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,170\nIf you don't have an alarm,\nit never knows to increase, right?\n\n498\n00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,640\nSo I'm going to add an alarm, and my\nalarm, I don't wanna set a notification.\n\n499\n00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,450\nThe temptation is, oh,\nI wanna get an email every time it scales.\n\n500\n00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,330\nWell, if you have a site that's busy,\n\n501\n00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,510\nyou will hate that within 24 hours\ncuz you'll get a lot of emails.\n\n502\n00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,770\nBut I'm gonna say when the average\nCPU is greater than or\n\n503\n00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,770\nequal to 80% for at least three\nconsecutive one minute periods.\n\n504\n00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,350\nOkay?\n\n505\n00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,180\nSo I'm gonna have it monitory my servers.\n\n506\n00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,300\nAnd if they're all at 80% CPU or\n\n507\n00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,160\nhigher for three minutes in a row,\nthen I want to auto scale.\n\n508\n00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,960\nOkay, that's my measure.\n\n509\n00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,840\nYour measure might be different.\n\n510\n00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,710\nYou might want to measure RAM utilization,\nor disk read, network in, out.\n\n511\n00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,060\nYou've got your different\nmeasures that you can set here,\n\n512\n00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,270\nas well as different intervals.\n\n513\n00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,050\nSo customize it to meet your needs,\nand get that set.\n\n514\n00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,240\nUnder here, the disk reads and writes,\nreally useful for database servers.\n\n515\n00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,160\nIf you have read-only database\nservers like online analysis or\n\n516\n00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,110\nOLAP, those you can do disk reads, and\nwhen the disk starts to get saturated\n\n517\n00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:41,310\non one server it can start to clone it and\nbuild up new ones, really handy stuff.\n\n518\n00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,140\nSo we'll leave that be and\ncreate that alarm.\n\n519\n00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,470\nNow it knows when to increase And\nhere we can tell what to do.\n\n520\n00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,890\nI wanna add servers, and\nI can tell it how many.\n\n521\n00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,833\nWhen I auto scale, do I wanna scale one\nserver at a time or do I wanna add two or\n\n522\n00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,722\nthree at a time?\n\n523\n00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:58,325\nYou can have it do batches if you want.\n\n524\n00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,786\nIt's entirely up to you.\n\n525\n00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,568\nIf you're load balancing\nacross four zones,\n\n526\n00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:03,082\nyou might want to spin up four at a time.\n\n527\n00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:05,980\nAnd that way,\nit's adding one to each zone.\n\n528\n00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,500\nIt's just kind of up to you.\n\n529\n00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,720\nI'll just do one, all right?\n\n530\n00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,920\nAnd then you can set a delay on how\nlong to wait before auto scaling again.\n\n531\n00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,050\nThis is useful if I'm monitoring for\n80% CPU utilization,\n\n532\n00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,760\nwhen this new system comes up,\nit takes a minute for it to boot up and\n\n533\n00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,990\nget into the pool and get into\nthe load balancer and start working.\n\n534\n00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,190\nSo it might take two or three minutes\nbefore this one actually affects anything.\n\n535\n00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,900\nSo I might not wanna auto scale again for\n\n536\n00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,880\na period of two minutes while\nthese other re-boot up.\n\n537\n00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,090\nAnd then we start measuring.\n\n538\n00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,740\nSo you can set a delay for that.\n\n539\n00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,910\nYou'll see that 300 is the default,\nand you can bump that up or\n\n540\n00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,959\ndown based on what you want.\n\n541\n00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,330\nIt's 300 seconds, so that's 5 minutes.\n\n542\n00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:46,920\n>> Six.\n\n543\n00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,525\n>> Five, that's all right.\n\n544\n00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:49,756\n[LAUGH]\n>> We can do math.\n\n545\n00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:52,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, basic math.\n\n546\n00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,990\nNow if I were to leave it at that,\nI've got an auto add rule, but\n\n547\n00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,730\nI don't have a remove.\n\n548\n00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,700\nWhat about when I get down into a valley.\n\n549\n00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,060\nWell there comes a time where I wanna\nremove some servers and get back down so\n\n550\n00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,490\nI can decrease the group size.\n\n551\n00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,670\nAnd again, I'll just add a new alarm.\n\n552\n00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,820\nAnd this time, I'm going to say,\nif I am less than 80%\n\n553\n00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,330\nfor at least three consecutive\nintervals of one minute.\n\n554\n00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,130\nThen I'll go ahead and\ndecrease servers, okay?\n\n555\n00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,890\nSo it's just going to monitor\nthem on the servers, and\n\n556\n00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,910\ndetermine when we can lower it.\n\n557\n00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,670\nAnd we might even want to\nset that a little bit lower.\n\n558\n00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,118\nMaybe set it down to like 70%, if I'm.\n\n559\n00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,420\nLess than 70%.\n\n560\n00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,960\nLet me turn off that notification.\n\n561\n00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,420\nIf I'm less than 70% so\nI could have a gap in between.\n\n562\n00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,480\nI'd rather have too many\nservers than too few.\n\n563\n00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,370\nAnd this may be a short valley before\njumping right back to another peak, so\n\n564\n00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,620\nI'm just giving myself\na little insulation here.\n\n565\n00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,120\nI think I'll even a little lower.\n\n566\n00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,090\nIf I'm less than 60% CPU for\nthree consecutive periods of one minute,\n\n567\n00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,560\nthen scale down, all right?\n\n568\n00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,610\nSo I got that alarm, and\nnow I can say remove.\n\n569\n00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,230\nAnd I'll just remove\none instance at a time.\n\n570\n00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,580\nAnd you typically want to\nset the same delay, but\n\n571\n00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,520\nthere's times you might\nwant to set other delays.\n\n572\n00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,810\nYou know, something longer.\n\n573\n00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,510\nAgain, if you'd rather have\nmore servers than too few,\n\n574\n00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,370\nyou set this delay longer, all right?\n\n575\n00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,490\nIf I wanted notifications,\nI can set those here.\n\n576\n00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,970\nYou know, you see in the logs,\nthat's good enough for me.\n\n577\n00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,990\nI don't normally like to get text\nmessages or emails with auto scales,\n\n578\n00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,890\nit can be crazy but\nif you're testing and developing\n\n579\n00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,560\nyou might want to do this in the beginning\nbecause you don't want to go broke.\n\n580\n00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,820\nYou come into the office\nin the morning and\n\n581\n00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,040\nyou find that you've been running\nat 100 instances all night long\n\n582\n00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,740\nbecause some script ran out of control.\n\n583\n00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,660\nIf you got notifications you\nwould've known about it, so\n\n584\n00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,120\nyou might wanna set that up.\n\n585\n00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,790\n>> Yeah it's a good way to start ignoring\nyour smart phone or whatever the case is.\n\n586\n00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,630\nI know I've done it.\n\n587\n00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,410\nCreating rules.\n\n588\n00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,070\nI'll just send that to the trash.\n\n589\n00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,780\n>> [LAUGH] I'll go ahead and review that,\nand it gives me my little summary here,\n\n590\n00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,850\nand I'll create that auto scaling group.\n\n591\n00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,260\nAnd once that's done, now it's up,\nit's running, and it's in business.\n\n592\n00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,980\nNow what's going on in the background?\n\n593\n00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,645\nIn the background it says hey, you just\ncreated an auto scaling group, and\n\n594\n00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:57,275\nit has zero members.\n\n595\n00:26:57,275 --> 00:26:59,375\nWe need at least one, so\nlet's split up that first one.\n\n596\n00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:03,215\nSo it should be spinning up an instance in\nthe background without me doing anything.\n\n597\n00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:07,255\nSo if I take a look at my auto\nscaling group, here it is.\n\n598\n00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:12,130\nInstance is zero, desired one,\nminimum one, maximum ten.\n\n599\n00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,350\nOkay so right now it knows\nthat it's got a problem.\n\n600\n00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,890\nIt's not that it has zero instances though\nit's just that it takes a moment for\n\n601\n00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,900\nit to spin those up.\n\n602\n00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,150\nSo it's spinning them up in the background\nit won't show up here as healthy\n\n603\n00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,340\nuntil it actually gets to that point.\n\n604\n00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,220\nYou can sit there and\nhit refresh and there it goes.\n\n605\n00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,700\nSo now it's showing that one instance.\n\n606\n00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,620\nIf I jump up to my instances screen\n\n607\n00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,050\nI can see up in here where I've got\na running instance right there.\n\n608\n00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,910\nMy other instance down here,\nit's still there and\n\n609\n00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,450\nstop right,\nthat's when I made the image from earlier.\n\n610\n00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,180\nAnd I could delete that if I wanted to.\n\n611\n00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,450\nI don't need it anymore but\nI kind of want to keep it around.\n\n612\n00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,870\nGoing back to what Daniel said ,what\nif I want to update the system,\n\n613\n00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,660\nthen I'm going to update this guy and\nbuild a new AMI out of it and then attach\n\n614\n00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,880\nthat to my launch configurations so\nthat my new systems re- updated.\n\n615\n00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,010\nSo I'll probably keep that one around if\nfor no other reason than to have something\n\n616\n00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,880\nI can update with but this is the guy\nthat in the load balancing cluster.\n\n617\n00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,790\nThis is the guy that is a part of the auto\nscaling group, and as it gets busier,\n\n618\n00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,420\nI'll start to see more of these instances\nstart to appear as it goes in and\n\n619\n00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,660\nfills that need.\n\n620\n00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,380\nNow what do my end user see?\n\n621\n00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,090\nNothing.\n\n622\n00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,120\nMy end users are being\ndirected to the load balancer.\n\n623\n00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,560\nWhen they wanna browse through that\nwebsite, they go to load balancer address,\n\n624\n00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,870\nwhich I never did pay attention\nto when I recreate it.\n\n625\n00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,890\nSo if I pull it up here, here's the DNS\nname for the load balancer that I made.\n\n626\n00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,990\nSo when they browse the web site,\nthey go to this load balancer.\n\n627\n00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,290\nThe load balancer, we set it so\n\n628\n00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,900\nthat all of our auto scaling notes\nget put into it, and they hit that.\n\n629\n00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,740\nAnd then the busier that gets,\nthe more nodes get built up behind it,\n\n630\n00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,610\nbut the end users just\nsee the load balancer.\n\n631\n00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,520\nThey don't know if you have one server or\na hundred servers or a thousand servers.\n\n632\n00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,370\nIt's invisible to them.\n\n633\n00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,950\nThey just see the low downs.\n\n634\n00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,060\n>> And that's good for them.\n\n635\n00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,650\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is,\n\n636\n00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,590\nit's good for us,\n>> Yeah.\n\n637\n00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,620\n>> It's really good for everybody.\n\n638\n00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,590\nIt's a win-win\n>> Yeah.\n\n639\n00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,870\n>> all across the board.\n\n640\n00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,450\nAnd it's even a win-win for Amazon.\n\n641\n00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,550\nI know you might be thinking\nwell that means I pay them less.\n\n642\n00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,320\nWell when you're not using the servers\nthey become spot instances for\n\n643\n00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,150\nother people or\nthey over-subscribe a piece of hardware.\n\n644\n00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,130\nThey can do that too.\n\n645\n00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,780\nAnd so Amazon actually gets better\nutilization out of their hardware because\n\n646\n00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,470\nof this and it's all done on the backend.\n\n647\n00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,030\nSo that's auto scaling,\n\n648\n00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,480\nnow be aware that not everything can\nauto scale, it's up to your application.\n\n649\n00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,340\nLike writeable databases are really\nhard to auto scale because\n\n650\n00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,970\nhow many writeable copies\nthat database can you have?\n\n651\n00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,630\nAnd yeah, you gotta synchronize\nbetween them and stuff.\n\n652\n00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,190\nSo there's some things that\ndon't auto scale well, but\n\n653\n00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,080\nthings like web servers,file\nservers those guys,\n\n654\n00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,300\nthey all scale great, chuck them in there\nreally easy to get those up and running.\n\n655\n00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,490\n>> Very cool this is definitely,\nI'm seeing the light Don,\n\n656\n00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,110\na true believer that this auto\nscaling is the way to go.\n\n657\n00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,940\nYou should be doing this.\n\n658\n00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,190\n>> Yeah, especially if you're an internet\nstartup, if you're looking for\n\n659\n00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,410\nthat jump to fame, if you're doing\na viral marketing campaign and\n\n660\n00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,780\nyou know that you might be blasting\nthe amount of users overnight.\n\n661\n00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,763\nAuto scaling will save your butt.\n\n662\n00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:03,080\n[LAUGH] There's no way around that.\n\n663\n00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,530\n>> Yeah, let's go viral.\n\n664\n00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,420\nHave we covered the bases on this guy?\n\n665\n00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> Awesome.\n\n666\n00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,640\nWell with that being said, I guess that's\nall we have for our auto scaling show.\n\n667\n00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,560\nI hope you guys learned a lot from it.\n\n668\n00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,780\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n669\n00:30:14,780

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,090\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,570\nHere with me today is my good friend and\ncolleague, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,740\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,780\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,550\nWe've got a great episode lined up for\nus today.\n\n9\n00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,980\nWe're gonna be taking a look at the Amazon\nWeb Services Command Line Interface.\n\n10\n00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,580\nThe CLI.\n\n11\n00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,700\n>> Yeah, the CLI is the mystical little\nthing where you actually have to type and\n\n12\n00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,560\nuse the keyboard.\n\n13\n00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,580\nThat's always a good time.\n\n14\n00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,451\nI know I enjoy using Linux and Cisco.\n\n15\n00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,631\nAnytime I get a chance to work with those\ntypes of devices, I really enjoy that.\n\n16\n00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:41,510\nSo, I'm interested in seeing\nwhat Amazon has to offer.\n\n17\n00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,100\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwe've seen the web interface for\n\n19\n00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,200\nAWS and all the different features and\ntools in there, why would I\n\n20\n00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,150\npossibly want to use a command line\ninterface when we've got this nice web UI?\n\n21\n00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,840\nAnd the answer is, well,\nmost of the time you will use the web UI.\n\n22\n00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,230\nIt's easy, it's simple,\nyou jump in there and you do it.\n\n23\n00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,200\nBut there's two main cases where\nwe're going to find we need that CLI.\n\n24\n00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,360\nThe first case is when we\nwant to configure something\n\n25\n00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,030\nthat isn't configurable in the web UI.\n\n26\n00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,890\nWhen Amazon develops a new feature,\nthey typically develop the command line\n\n27\n00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,770\ninterface commands for it first and\nthen make the web UI for it second.\n\n28\n00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,930\nSo, when features like\nauto-scaling originally launched.\n\n29\n00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,660\nIf you wanted to set up an auto-scaling\ngroup, you had to do that through the CLI.\n\n30\n00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,600\nAnd then it wasn't until a few months\nlater that they rolled out the web UI.\n\n31\n00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,560\nSo that you have that\naccess via the web page.\n\n32\n00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,860\nSo, if you watched our\nauto-scaling episode,\n\n33\n00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,460\nwe configured that pretty much all through\nthe web UI, cuz you can do that now.\n\n34\n00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,750\nBut in the beginning you couldn't.\n\n35\n00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,530\nSo if you're trying to take advantage of\nthe latest and greatest features in AWS,\n\n36\n00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,780\noftentimes you'll find yourself\nusing that command line interface.\n\n37\n00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,472\nThe other reason is automation.\n\n38\n00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:49,898\nAutomation, it's something we all have\nto tackle at some point or another,\n\n39\n00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,479\nwhen we want to activities to\nhappen at a certain time, but\n\n40\n00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,970\nwe don't want to be there for it.\n\n41\n00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,020\nNow a great example would be,\n\n42\n00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,350\nmaybe I wanna take a snapshot of a service\nhard drive every night at 1:00 AM.\n\n43\n00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,673\nWell, I don't want to wake up or\n\n44\n00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:05,012\nstay up until 1:00 AM every night just\nto take this snapshot and do it by hand.\n\n45\n00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:09,232\nIt'd be nice if I could automate that\nto happen and just run at 1:00 AM.\n\n46\n00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:10,453\nI don't even have to think about it.\n\n47\n00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:14,470\nWell, you can't automate\nclicking on a web page.\n\n48\n00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,500\nI guess you can, it's not very easy to do.\n\n49\n00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,060\nBut what you can automate,\nis running a command line script.\n\n50\n00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,930\nSo, you could write a script that\ncall the various AWS command line\n\n51\n00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,360\nutilities to reach out and\ntake a snapshot of that drive.\n\n52\n00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,310\nNow, 1:00 AM, your snapshot is made,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n53\n00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,640\nSo those are the two big scenarios\nwhere we see the command line\n\n54\n00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,120\nuser interface getting used.\n\n55\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,698\n>> Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:38,225\nDon, well, are you gonna show us\nsome AWS command line interface so\n\n57\n00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:42,038\nthat I can at least come off a little more\npretentious than I normally would be.\n\n58\n00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:45,073\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, suspender wearing Linux snob.\n\n59\n00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,035\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n60\n00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,355\nactually I mentioned Linux snob, right?\n\n61\n00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,800\nIt doesn't matter which\noperating system you run.\n\n62\n00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,373\nAmazon created the command line interface\nto support all the operating systems.\n\n63\n00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:57,253\nThey wrote the CLI completely in Python.\n\n64\n00:02:57,253 --> 00:03:00,843\nAnd that means that it can run on Windows,\nMac OS, Linux, doesn't matter.\n\n65\n00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:03,923\nAs long as you have the Python libraries\ninstalled, you're in business.\n\n66\n00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:06,764\nWell, if you're a Windows user,\nit's really easy.\n\n67\n00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:10,385\nYou can go to the AWS webpage and\nright there in the documentation,\n\n68\n00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:13,630\nthey have a nice little download link for\nan MSI installer.\n\n69\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,130\nThey make it really easy for\nthe Windows users.\n\n70\n00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,680\nLet me show you guys that page.\n\n71\n00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,950\nThis is the Installing AWS\nCommand Line Interface page.\n\n72\n00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,400\nIt's part of the AWS documentation.\n\n73\n00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,300\nAnd for Windows, they actually\nhave CLI downloaders right here.\n\n74\n00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,850\nNow, I usually use the 32-bit version for\nWindows regardless of the OS.\n\n75\n00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,840\nAnd that's because,\nnotice this little note here?\n\n76\n00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,430\nHow the 64-bit version doesn't work\nwith Windows Server 2008 bla, bla, bla?\n\n77\n00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,360\nEvery now and then there's issues\nwith the 64-bit CLI on Windows.\n\n78\n00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,980\nAnd you don't really benefit\nfrom it that much anyway.\n\n79\n00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,020\nSo, the 32-bit CLI is\nwhat I normally do there.\n\n80\n00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,780\nIf you're running Linux or\nif you're running Mac OS though,\n\n81\n00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,680\nwe don't have a nice little installer,\nbut we don't really need one.\n\n82\n00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,090\nWe can use Python to install it for us.\n\n83\n00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,490\nSo, for example, on Mac OS you\nalready have Python installed.\n\n84\n00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,940\nAnd if you're on Linux, you more than\nlikely already have it installed.\n\n85\n00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,480\nBut if you don't,\n\n86\n00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,240\nit's usually just a quick package\ncommand away to get it installed.\n\n87\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,400\nLike you might do a, sudo yum install\nPython, on a CentOS Red Hat system.\n\n88\n00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680\nUsually, you'll find that it's already\ninstalled, so you don't sweat it.\n\n89\n00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,240\nNow, once we have Python installed.\n\n90\n00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,030\nThen we can install the AWSCLI,\nand it's super easy.\n\n91\n00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,126\nBecause Python has a package\nmanager built into it called Pip.\n\n92\n00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:28,410\nAnd we can use Pip to install AWS.\n\n93\n00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,880\nIt's super simple, and you just run,\nit's on here somewhere.\n\n94\n00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,177\nWe'll find the Pip command,\nwhich is, there it is, right there.\n\n95\n00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,280\nPip install awscli.\n\n96\n00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,230\nAnd as simple as that, it'll install.\n\n97\n00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,770\nAnd if you're on a Linux or\n\n98\n00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,030\na Mac OS machine,\nodds are that's all you have to install.\n\n99\n00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,690\nYou can check.\n\n100\n00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,484\nI'm on a Mac and so I might start\nby typing in Python --version.\n\n101\n00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,660\nAnd that's just gonna let me know\nif Python is installed or not.\n\n102\n00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,690\nYour Mac will likely have\nPython already on it.\n\n103\n00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,530\nIt should.\n\n104\n00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,080\nIf it doesn't, then it may have been\nremoved, or it might be an older version.\n\n105\n00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,920\nApple isn't the greatest at\noffering the latest version of\n\n106\n00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,770\nPython with their system.\n\n107\n00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,680\nSo, you might have to use\nsoftware like Homebrew or\n\n108\n00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,540\nsomething to install\nthe updated Python libraries.\n\n109\n00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,737\nBut as long as you've got Python,\nyou'll have the pip command.\n\n110\n00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:18,929\nAnd you can run Pip install awscli.\n\n111\n00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:22,200\nAnd it'll reach out,\n\n112\n00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,990\nit'll find that package information,\nand there it goes installing.\n\n113\n00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,270\nSimple as that.\n\n114\n00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,315\nOnce it's installed, you can run aws help,\n\n115\n00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:36,480\nand you should get the help\ndocumentation for that.\n\n116\n00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,860\nI now have the AWS CLI right here.\n\n117\n00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,370\nAnd it's just listing out\nthe various commands for me.\n\n118\n00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,180\nSo now I can run AWS,\nfollowed by assorted commands, and\n\n119\n00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,250\nI can start to work on my system.\n\n120\n00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,550\nOn a Windows machine,\nI would've run that MSI installer.\n\n121\n00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,270\nWhen it was done, just open up\na command prompt and run aws help.\n\n122\n00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,070\nSame thing.\n\n123\n00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,385\nOn a Linux machine, pip install awscli,\nand then the aws help command, and\n\n124\n00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:00,470\nyou're in there.\n\n125\n00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,900\nNow, if you already have some\ninstances spun up in the Amazon cloud,\n\n126\n00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,640\nany of the Amazon built images.\n\n127\n00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,138\nSo, if you use like the Amazon Linux AMI\nor the Amazon Windows AMIs.\n\n128\n00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:18,210\nWhen you deploy those instances, they\ninclude the CLI on that machine for you.\n\n129\n00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,348\nSo, you don't have to install it,\nit's already there.\n\n130\n00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,640\nFor example,\nif I connect to an instance that I have.\n\n131\n00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,019\nOh shoot, here, let me find it,\ninstance to use.\n\n132\n00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,079\nSo, if I take a look at my EC2 instances.\n\n133\n00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,160\nI've got one that I spun\nup from a Linux AMI.\n\n134\n00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,840\nThis is just a regular Amazon Linux AMI,\nnothing special about it.\n\n135\n00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,360\nAnd if I connect to this host and\nI connect this EC2 user.\n\n136\n00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,182\nWhen I connect up to it,\n\n137\n00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:53,840\nI'll see that it's already got\nthe AWS CLI installed on it.\n\n138\n00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,400\nSo, here I am, I'm remoted into that,\nand you'll see it right there.\n\n139\n00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,590\nAmazon Linux AMI.\n\n140\n00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,370\nAnd if I run aws help.\n\n141\n00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,120\nSure enough, there's that command?\n\n142\n00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,170\nSo, if you've got a Windows or\n\n143\n00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,340\nLinux box up there in the cloud,\nit's already got the CLI ready for you.\n\n144\n00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,350\nBut if you wanna install\nit on your own machine, or\n\n145\n00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,640\na server in your office,\neasy enough to get it installed.\n\n146\n00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,797\n>> I guess all that's left now is\ndoing a little configuration for\n\n147\n00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:17,535\nit though, huh Don?\n\n148\n00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,355\n>> Yeah, it does need to know\nhow to connect to your account.\n\n149\n00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:24,785\nAnd the way we connect it to an account\nis to provide it credentials.\n\n150\n00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,230\nIt's got to have the user credentials\nto be able to access your system.\n\n151\n00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,680\nAs it is right now,\nit doesn't actually work.\n\n152\n00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,300\nIt's here, right?\n\n153\n00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,712\nBut if I run aws.\n\n154\n00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:36,692\nActually, I already have this one set up.\n\n155\n00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:38,713\nLet me get back out to my\nworkstation where it's not set up.\n\n156\n00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:42,530\nSo, if I run aws ec2.\n\n157\n00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,710\nAnd this is kind of how the syntax works.\n\n158\n00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,340\nIt's aws,\nthat's the CLI that we're calling.\n\n159\n00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,140\nThe next command is what\nservice we're working with.\n\n160\n00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,342\nSo, I'm working with ec2.\n\n161\n00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:56,928\nAnd then I'll say, describe-instances.\n\n162\n00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,971\nWhich should list for me all of\nthe instances attached to my account.\n\n163\n00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:06,350\nAnd when I run that, it's gonna reach out,\nand I get, I must specify a region.\n\n164\n00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,450\nI don't have a region.\n\n165\n00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,540\nIt doesn't actually have an account.\n\n166\n00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,440\nIt doesn't know who to connect to\nto get that information for me.\n\n167\n00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,620\nAnd it's telling me I need\nto run AWS configure.\n\n168\n00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,300\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat command I run here.\n\n169\n00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,170\nAny of the commands I run other than\nhelp are pretty much gonna return this.\n\n170\n00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,450\nI need to run AWS configure\nto get this set up.\n\n171\n00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,880\nNow, when you run AWS configure,\nit's gonna ask you four questions, right?\n\n172\n00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,710\nTwo that you have to answer,\ntwo that are optional.\n\n173\n00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,070\nThe first thing it's gonna ask is for\nyour access key ID.\n\n174\n00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,740\nAnd then it's going to ask for\nyour secret key.\n\n175\n00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,730\nThese are the two identifiers\nthat identify you.\n\n176\n00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,880\nThat allow you to be able to connect\nto the system and work with it.\n\n177\n00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,150\nYou get those from inside\nof Amazon Web Services.\n\n178\n00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,500\nIf I go back here to my console.\n\n179\n00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,610\nSo here I am in AWS.\n\n180\n00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,730\nI can go to Identity and\nAccess Management right here.\n\n181\n00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,050\nAnd if I go into the IAM screens,\nI can come in here and\n\n182\n00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,040\nI can see user accounts that\nI've created for my system.\n\n183\n00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,590\nAnd so I can create a new user account.\n\n184\n00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,930\nI'll create a user you know,\nmaybe call him like roadmin.\n\n185\n00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,470\nThis will be like a read only admin\naccount that I'm making, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,550\nAnd see how it's got this generate\nan access key for each user?\n\n187\n00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,870\nThat's the access key that I need.\n\n188\n00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,199\nAnd when I go and hit create, it's gonna\ncreate that account and if I hit show\n\n189\n00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:23,450\nsecurity credentials, there's the access\nkey and there's the secret key.\n\n190\n00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,620\nNow be careful with this.\n\n191\n00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,000\nThis is the last time that\nAmazon will show you these keys.\n\n192\n00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,490\nIf I lose these, you just have to\ndelete the keys and create new ones.\n\n193\n00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,110\nThere's no way to recover the keys\nonce you've made it past this screen.\n\n194\n00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,800\nSo they give you the option\nto download them.\n\n195\n00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,300\nYou can download them or you can just\ncopy and paste them or whatever and\n\n196\n00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,410\nthat's what I'm gonna do because these\nare just temporary here for the show.\n\n197\n00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,651\nSo I'll paste those in.\n\n198\n00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,550\nI'll get those two values.\n\n199\n00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,680\nAll right.\n\n200\n00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,460\nThose are the two questions\nthat I have to answer.\n\n201\n00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,180\nIf I don't answer those two, this command\nline utility is pretty useless, right?\n\n202\n00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,680\nBut now I can go on and\nI can add two other things.\n\n203\n00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,250\nThere's a default region.\n\n204\n00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,260\nWhen I run a command\nlike describe instances,\n\n205\n00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,780\nit wants to know what region to look for\nthose instances, and I didn't tell it.\n\n206\n00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,710\nNow I could have told in\nthe command line if I wanted,\n\n207\n00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,490\nwith a little -region or\n--region, whatever.\n\n208\n00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,612\nBut, instead,\nI can tell it a default here, and\n\n209\n00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,320\nI'll tell it us-east-1, all right?\n\n210\n00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,370\nAnd then the last question\nis when it gives me output,\n\n211\n00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,930\nwhen it displays information to me on\nthe screen, what format do I want it in?\n\n212\n00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,420\nAnd there's a few different formats.\n\n213\n00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,610\nThere's text.\n\n214\n00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,880\nThere's a table.\n\n215\n00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,540\nThere's JSON if you're a developer,\nyou know you want that JSON output.\n\n216\n00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,500\nSo you can specify which one you want.\n\n217\n00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,070\nI'll just say text.\n\n218\n00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,740\nAll right.\n\n219\n00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,690\nThose are the four main questions\nthat I needed to feed it.\n\n220\n00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,680\nNow it knows my account thanks\nto the access key right here.\n\n221\n00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,320\nAnd it's able to access my account\nthanks to the secret key right here.\n\n222\n00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,520\nAnd then it knows my default\nregion in default output format.\n\n223\n00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,350\nSo now when I start to run something\nlike AWS eC2 describe-instances,\n\n224\n00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,210\nit knows me, and\nit can reach out there and do it.\n\n225\n00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,360\nWell, I did miss one step right?\n\n226\n00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,170\nHere it's telling me I'm not\nauthorized to perform this operation.\n\n227\n00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,990\nWell what does that mean?\n\n228\n00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,450\nI created a user account back here, but I\ndidn't actually give them any permissions.\n\n229\n00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,840\nI just created the account.\n\n230\n00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,600\nSo I've got this roadmin account right\nthere, but they don't have any access.\n\n231\n00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,770\nAnd so what I really need to do is take\nthat user and attach a policy to them so\n\n232\n00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,520\nthey can have access.\n\n233\n00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,680\nSo I just clicked on the user and\nthen I'll go to attach policy, and\n\n234\n00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,010\nnow I need to give them access.\n\n235\n00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,070\nI could make them an administrator.\n\n236\n00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,900\nGive them full control\nover the whole system.\n\n237\n00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,210\nThat's a good time.\n\n238\n00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,835\nOr I could go through and\nI could be a little more specific.\n\n239\n00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:44,775\nAnd so you'll see things in here like for\nDynamoDB, and there's EC2.\n\n240\n00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:48,915\nAnd I'm gonna give them\nEC2 read only access.\n\n241\n00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,905\nAnd I might give them\nlike reports access or\n\n242\n00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,135\nother things if this is going\nto be a read only person.\n\n243\n00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:57,485\nI just don't want them to be able to\nchange things and start creating stuff.\n\n244\n00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,770\nSo I'm gonna give them\nthat read only access.\n\n245\n00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,130\nAnd I'll attach that policy.\n\n246\n00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,950\n>> Now Don, these policies,\nare they like role based permissions, or\n\n247\n00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,960\nis that more among the groups?\n\n248\n00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,310\n>> Well, you can use both.\n\n249\n00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,550\nSo these policies, the way they're\nwritten is kind of interesting,\n\n250\n00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,520\nbecause I'm attaching this\npolicy to a particular user.\n\n251\n00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,670\nAnd see how I did two different\npolicies to the same user?\n\n252\n00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,150\nThat's generally not a great idea.\n\n253\n00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,970\nIf you watch our IAM episode, we'll\nshow how you can actually take these and\n\n254\n00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,640\nattach them to a group, so that you just\nput the user in one group, and that's it.\n\n255\n00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,250\nSo you actually do end up using\nboth groups and policies.\n\n256\n00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,930\nAnd the idea is attach your policies to\ngroups, put your users in the groups, and\n\n257\n00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,530\nso that's kind of the better way to do it.\n\n258\n00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,110\nBut here, just for the sake of this\nexample, I'll attach it right to the user.\n\n259\n00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,600\nAll right, so that's set,\nthat user should be good.\n\n260\n00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,160\nAnd now I can drop back to my CLI, and\nwe can try that same command again.\n\n261\n00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,047\nAnd this time they have read only access,\nand so they're able to read\n\n262\n00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:55,082\nthat information and display it right\nthere on the screen, all right?\n\n263\n00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:58,140\nNow that output came out\nas just straight up text.\n\n264\n00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,540\nAnd it's a little bit messy, right?\n\n265\n00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,570\nWell, that's cuz I set the default\nto output data as text.\n\n266\n00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,210\nAnd so this might be good if\nI'm cutting and pasting or\n\n267\n00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,940\nwhatever, but\nit's not necessarily very readable.\n\n268\n00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,335\nSo I might choose to modify that.\n\n269\n00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:13,670\nNow remember my default\noutput type was text.\n\n270\n00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,140\nI can over-ride that at any time by saying\n--output, and then specifying what I want.\n\n271\n00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,721\nDo I want it as JSON,\ncuz I'm a developer, right?\n\n272\n00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,941\nAnd then it gives you that kind\nof almost XML like formatting for\n\n273\n00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:27,670\nall those settings.\n\n274\n00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,380\nOr do I want it to be a table,\nwhich is probably the easiest to read?\n\n275\n00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,290\nAnd now the data comes out in\na nice organized table right?\n\n276\n00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,155\nSo I can see here's my instances and\ntheir breakdown underneath that, and\n\n277\n00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:41,870\nit lists all the other\ninformation inside of there.\n\n278\n00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,780\nMakes life a lot easier.\n\n279\n00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,710\nThere are a ton of commands inside of AWS.\n\n280\n00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,460\nAnd they're all divided up by the service.\n\n281\n00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,360\nSo we do AWS help.\n\n282\n00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,420\nYou'll see that as I kind of\nscroll through the information,\n\n283\n00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,750\nhere's the available servers.\n\n284\n00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,180\nSo I've been doing AWS ec2.\n\n285\n00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,685\nBut you could do AWS auto-scaling, and\ncloud formation, cloud trail, cloud watch,\n\n286\n00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:11,830\nec2 is right there, DynamoDB, all of\nthem have full command line interfaces.\n\n287\n00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,610\nYou'll even see some in here that don't\nhave a corresponding page on the UI They\n\n288\n00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,350\nhaven't even been added to the web UI yet\nas a link, better yet,\n\n289\n00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,550\nhave full functionality for configuration.\n\n290\n00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,040\nOther ones you'll see in here,\n\n291\n00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,360\nlike lambda, do have web UIs that\nyou can use to get them set up.\n\n292\n00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,630\nSo it's just kinda up to you to figure\nout what you want to work with.\n\n293\n00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,270\nBut I use this with S3 a lot, right?\n\n294\n00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,900\nUploading files, downloading files,\nlisting directories,\n\n295\n00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,780\nthings like that in S3.\n\n296\n00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,160\nIt's really nice to have\na command-line utility for it.\n\n297\n00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,370\nFor ec2, you can use it too though for\nsnapshots and so on.\n\n298\n00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,510\nThere is a ton of information in there.\n\n299\n00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,120\nAll right now one thing that I always\nbump into is I ran AWS configure,\n\n300\n00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,870\nand I put in my credentials, and\nnow every command I run like AWS,\n\n301\n00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,440\nec2, describe-instances,\nlet's just pull it back up.\n\n302\n00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,270\nThat's running as my account,\nmy credentials.\n\n303\n00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,230\nBut I actually help out a lot of\npeople when I'm not on the show.\n\n304\n00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,610\nPeople who are trying to\ndeploy things in the cloud.\n\n305\n00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,840\nAnd so I'll have accounts on\nmore than one AWS account.\n\n306\n00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,150\nSo what if I wanna do that, what if I\nwanna access other people's accounts?\n\n307\n00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,550\nWell, you can run AWS configuring and\nkeep changing your credentials over and\n\n308\n00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,780\nover again, but that gets old pretty fast.\n\n309\n00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:28,120\nSo a better option would be to do\nsomething like setting up profiles.\n\n310\n00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,860\nNow a profile that's where you can call\ndifferent credentials, different settings\n\n311\n00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,440\nfor different users, and that makes it\nreally easy to manage multiple accounts.\n\n312\n00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,230\nSo I do use profiles quite a bit\ncuz it does make life a lot easier.\n\n313\n00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,730\nSo let me show you an example\nof how that works.\n\n314\n00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,878\nI'm actually gonna switch to that,\n\n315\n00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:49,610\nlet me switch to that instance that's up\nin the cloud that I had sitting up there.\n\n316\n00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,095\nActually do I still have\nthat in my history?\n\n317\n00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:56,367\nAll right so I'm just gonna connect back\nto that Linux AMI that's up there in\n\n318\n00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,922\nthe cloud, and\nI've got AWS already set up.\n\n319\n00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:03,646\nAnd if I do AWS configure, I can come in\nhere and I can see it obscures the key, so\n\n320\n00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,520\nyou guys can't see what it is.\n\n321\n00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,830\nBut this is my administrator account,\nright?\n\n322\n00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,280\nThis is my full on admin.\n\n323\n00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,170\nSo I can go in and do whatever I need\nwith this account right here, okay?\n\n324\n00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,330\nBut I can create other profiles that are\neither completely different accounts, or\n\n325\n00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,770\njust have different preferences and\nsettings.\n\n326\n00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,748\nAnd that way kind of keeps them separate.\n\n327\n00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:28,210\nAnd if we want to set that up,\nit's really not that hard to do.\n\n328\n00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,890\nWhen I ran AWS configure, that's\nconfiguring it for my default profile.\n\n329\n00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,740\nWe leave it off, right?\n\n330\n00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,690\nBut I could come in here say,\n-- profile roadmin.\n\n331\n00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,000\nAnd now, it's running the configuration\nfor a new profile called roadmin.\n\n332\n00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,790\nSo I might have DPezet, whatever,\n\n333\n00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,670\nfor Company A, DPezet Company B,\nDPezet Company C.\n\n334\n00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,650\nAnd then when I run this, if I append\nthe command with --profile whatever,\n\n335\n00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,970\nnow it's running in that kind of\ncompartmentalized environment.\n\n336\n00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,270\nSo I can support more than one account.\n\n337\n00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,310\nSo here I can go in and\n\n338\n00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,590\nI can punch in those credentials,\nwhich of course I didn't save.\n\n339\n00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,015\nCuz, why would I do that, right?\n\n340\n00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n341\n00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,920\nthis goes back to exactly\nwhat I said a minute ago.\n\n342\n00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,030\nThere's no way to recover\nthose credentials, right?\n\n343\n00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,750\nSo I can't go and pull those back up.\n\n344\n00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,870\nWell you know I probably just have it\nin my command history if I scroll back,\n\n345\n00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,745\nget them right off the screen.\n\n346\n00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:22,770\n[LAUGH] But we'll cheat a little bit.\n\n347\n00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,595\n>> That's right,\ngo around the problem, right Don?\n\n348\n00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:28,390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Why bother following actual\n\n349\n00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,320\nsecurity principles here?\n\n350\n00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,290\nSo I can go and I can grab those and\njust kinda punch those in.\n\n351\n00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,540\nAnd, I need to get my private key.\n\n352\n00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,750\nSo I'll throw those in.\n\n353\n00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,650\nAnd now, when I want to test\nthe read only admin account,\n\n354\n00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,790\nI can get them right from here,\nand I can test it out.\n\n355\n00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,930\nBut when I wanna work in my\nfull admin account, I can.\n\n356\n00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,580\nCuz I kinda set that as the default.\n\n357\n00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,640\nAnd in real life,\nI usually do it the other way around.\n\n358\n00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,860\nWhere I take a read only account,\nand I make that my default.\n\n359\n00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,100\nAnd that way if I'm just trying to\ngather information from the system,\n\n360\n00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,020\nI just use the regular AWS command.\n\n361\n00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,690\nBut if I wanna make some significant\nchange, I have to remember to throw\n\n362\n00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,010\nthat --profile in there, and that makes\nsure I don't make any accidental mistakes.\n\n363\n00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,030\nThat's just one way that I do it.\n\n364\n00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,500\nBut I'll do something a little\ndifferent on this one.\n\n365\n00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,810\nSo for the read only admin,\nI'll set their default output as a table.\n\n366\n00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,382\nSo now,\nwhen I run something like aws ec2 describe\n\n367\n00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:25,130\ninstances, and\nI run that as me as the admin.\n\n368\n00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,020\nMy default output type was text, right?\n\n369\n00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,500\nSo when I run that, it's going to get,\nit's going to output it as text.\n\n370\n00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,090\nBut if I add, --profile roadmin,\nit's gonna run it as that other account.\n\n371\n00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,970\nAnd when it does, their default was table.\n\n372\n00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,710\nAnd so there's that different default.\n\n373\n00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,683\nAlso any command I run with\n--profile roadmin, is read-only.\n\n374\n00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,430\nIt won't be able to make changes.\n\n375\n00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,310\nBut if I run it as me, without the\n--profile, I will be able to make changes.\n\n376\n00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,780\nSo now you can manage multiple accounts\nall right here from inside of the CLI,\n\n377\n00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620\nwhich is pretty neat.\n\n378\n00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,080\n>> It's almost like doing a Sudu,\nbut kind of the other way around.\n\n379\n00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,700\n[LAUGH] Like you were saying.\n\n380\n00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,320\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n381\n00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,800\nI do normally do it the other way, right?\n\n382\n00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,980\nWhere the read only account is my default.\n\n383\n00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,200\nOr often times,\nI won't even configure the default.\n\n384\n00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,730\nBecause I just get used to doing the\n--profiles, so I've always got it there.\n\n385\n00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,420\nBut if you got one account\nyou use all the time,\n\n386\n00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,133\nit's nice to be able to\nleave that little bit off.\n\n387\n00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,470\nYou know, leave that --profile stuff off.\n\n388\n00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,010\nNow, I set this up under my\nuser account on this system.\n\n389\n00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,740\nIf I were to log out, and Daniel,\nyou logged in on my machine.\n\n390\n00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,660\nWell, that was all set\nup under my profile.\n\n391\n00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,110\nSo you'd have to go and\nset up your own stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,440\nThe AWS command line would\nstill be installed, but\n\n393\n00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,410\nyou'd have to go and\nconfigure that with your credentials.\n\n394\n00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,850\n>> And that's the right way to do things\nthat way if I make a change you'll\n\n395\n00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,170\nsee in the logs,\nespecially if I mess something up.\n\n396\n00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,130\nWell Daniel, there he is kicking his\nclumsy feet around on my AWS CLI.\n\n397\n00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,730\nI'm gonna go and knock him a good one.\n\n398\n00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That is exactly how\n\n399\n00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,420\nI'd say it, too.\n\n400\n00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,180\nI'd say, it's uncanny.\n\n401\n00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,990\n>> That was my Don impression.\n\n402\n00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,418\nThis happens a lot behind the scenes.\n\n403\n00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,970\n>> [LAUGH] All right, I will mention one\nother thing before we wrap this one up.\n\n404\n00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,380\nWhich is,\nPython was the key requirement here.\n\n405\n00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,190\nAnd on a Windows system you\ndon't have Python, but it's not\n\n406\n00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,030\na big deal because when you use that MSI\ninstaller from Amazon, it installs it.\n\n407\n00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,120\nIt adds Python and\nit gets that set up, really,\n\n408\n00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,070\nthat's the easiest to\ninstall of all of them.\n\n409\n00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,540\nOn a Linux box,\nit's simply a matter of adding it.\n\n410\n00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,760\nAnd back here under the help document,\nlet me bring this back up,\n\n411\n00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,840\none of the things they\ngo into Is right here.\n\n412\n00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,770\nSo if you need Python,\nhere's the commands for installing it for\n\n413\n00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,905\nDebian based systems, for Red Hat or\nCentOS, and for SUSE Linux.\n\n414\n00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:38,660\nThere's the three different ways that\nyou can do that on a Linux system.\n\n415\n00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,740\nOn a Mac,\nyou've got Apple's Python they install.\n\n416\n00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,020\nAnd if that's not good enough,\n\n417\n00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,890\nthen you really need to install\nan updated Python library.\n\n418\n00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,730\nAnd for that, I recommend\na little program called Homebrew.\n\n419\n00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,190\nAnd let me just pull up\ntheir page real quick.\n\n420\n00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,810\nHomebrew is just a package manager\nthat you can install on top of OSX.\n\n421\n00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,080\nI've used it for for a long time.\n\n422\n00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,210\nIt's really great.\n\n423\n00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,890\nYou just copy this one\nlittle ruby command,\n\n424\n00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,050\nbecause every mac as Ruby installed,\nand you run that and it installs Brew.\n\n425\n00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:15,470\nAnd once that's on there, all you have to\ndo is from your CLI, on your your Mac,\n\n426\n00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,400\nyou can to say, brew install python,\nand that'll install it on the system.\n\n427\n00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200\nI've already got it installed,\nso it'll tell me that.\n\n428\n00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,630\nBut it'll install on the system and\nnow you've got it.\n\n429\n00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,600\nAnd you just follow that\nup with pip install awscli,\n\n430\n00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640\nand you're in business, right.\n\n431\n00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,980\nThat'll get you there and\nget you knocked out.\n\n432\n00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,670\nSo Mac, Linux, Windows,\nyou're covered, right.\n\n433\n00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,580\nAll the Python based systems.\n\n434\n00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,370\n>> Very cool.\n>> All right, well Daniel,\n\n435\n00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,600\nI think that is all I've got\non the command line interface.\n\n436\n00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,630\nI can't think of anything else to\nmention offhand except there are a ton\n\n437\n00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,700\nof AWS commands out there.\n\n438\n00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,070\nWe certainly don't have time\nto go through all those, but\n\n439\n00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,160\ncheck out that help documentation for\nthe service that you're working with.\n\n440\n00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,620\nSo, EC2 has its documentation,\nRoute53 has its, and so on.\n\n441\n00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,360\nThey've all got a different\nset of command line utilities.\n\n442\n00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,250\n>> Awesome, well, wise words from Mr.\n\n443\n00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,270\nDon Pezet, so listen to what he's\ntelling you and take it to heart.\n\n444\n00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,440\nThat being said, I guess we've come to the\nconclusion of another episode by ITProTV.\n\n445\n00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,150\nI hope you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n446\n00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,460\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n447\n00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,070\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n448\n00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,215\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:20,310\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:18,172\nI'll be your host Daniel Lowery here with\nme today is my good friend Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:19,113\nHow you doing today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:22,762\n>> I'm doing well, I'm excited because\ntoday we're gonna be switching gears,\n\n7\n00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,551\nwe've been focusing on Amazon's\nweb servers up until now.\n\n8\n00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:29,640\nBut in this episode, we're gonna\nstart talking about Microsoft Azure.\n\n9\n00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,280\nAnd Microsoft Azure, it's newer to the\nmarket than Amazon Web Services has been.\n\n10\n00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,670\nAWS has been out for a long time.\n\n11\n00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,120\nAzure is Microsoft's foray into the hosted\ndata center solutions and boy, they\n\n12\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,500\nhave set out to make a top notch product\nand they've done really well with that.\n\n13\n00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,800\nSo it's a robust design they've got.\n\n14\n00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,630\nThey've got numerous data centers around\nthe world a lot of the same stuff that we\n\n15\n00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,330\nsaw Amazon but\ndone in the Microsoft manner.\n\n16\n00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,540\nIt is still an evolving technology\nthey're adding more to it and\n\n17\n00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,940\nwhat you'll find is that things, things\nlike the web interface might not be as\n\n18\n00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,350\nfull features what you have\nwith Amazon Web Services.\n\n19\n00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,560\nBut they're continuing to add to it.\n\n20\n00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,350\nLot of new features coming in there and\nvery price competitive with Amazon.\n\n21\n00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,850\nSo definitely one of the Cloud service\nproviders you want to look into.\n\n22\n00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,233\n>> Yeah, if anything about\na Microsoft you'll know is that,\n\n23\n00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:16,344\nif something is making money, they're\ngonna put their fingers in that pot.\n\n24\n00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:16,911\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So and\n\n25\n00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,490\nactually I think they've done\na really good job with Azure.\n\n26\n00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,630\nI really like the interface.\n\n27\n00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,840\nI like the way it works.\n\n28\n00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,090\nIt's very user friendly.\n\n29\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,140\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,060\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout their infrastructure and\n\n31\n00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,080\nkind of what Microsoft\nbrings to the table.\n\n32\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,620\nWell the main thing Microsoft\nbrings to the table is that they\n\n33\n00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,630\nare one of the main operating\nsystem benders in the world.\n\n34\n00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,560\nMicrosoft Windows is the most common\noperating system in the world.\n\n35\n00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,010\nSo for them to virtualize it, they're\nnot virtualizing other people's stuff,\n\n36\n00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,810\nthey're virtualizing their own and\nthey can do a great job with that.\n\n37\n00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,731\nNow, they do provide Linux of the arms\nalso so they're not just Windows.\n\n38\n00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:50,094\nA lot of people pigeonhole that like,\n\n39\n00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:52,550\nwell I don't use Azure cuz I\ndon't use Windows servers.\n\n40\n00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,210\nYou don't have to.\n\n41\n00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,430\nYou can bring your Linux servers,\nyou can do all of that.\n\n42\n00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,061\nIt runs just fine,\njust like on EC2 and Rack Space and\n\n43\n00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,052\nthe other providers that are out there.\n\n44\n00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:02,530\nAll right,\nlet's talk about their infrastructure.\n\n45\n00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,160\nTo provide the Azure hosted data centers,\nMicrosoft went ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,110\ncreated 17 data centers around the world.\n\n47\n00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,047\nNow, they use their terms a little bit\ndifferent for this stuff than with Amazon\n\n48\n00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:16,012\nwith Amazon you have regions\nwhich are their data centers.\n\n49\n00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:20,689\nAnd you have zones within a region that\nare basically like independent networks\n\n50\n00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:26,170\nthat separate things out and usually have\ntwo, maybe three zones in each region.\n\n51\n00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,505\nMicrosoft doesn't technically have zones,\n\n52\n00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:30,650\ncuz they follow a slightly\ndifferent model.\n\n53\n00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,610\nInside each data center, the data center\nitself is compartmentalized into these,\n\n54\n00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,320\nthey call them fault domains.\n\n55\n00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,840\nAnd there'll be hundreds of fault domain,\nsometimes the inside of one data center.\n\n56\n00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,270\nSo they don't bother with\nthat zone terminology.\n\n57\n00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,180\nAnd so you'll see them use\nthat term interchangeably.\n\n58\n00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,840\nThey'll say region, they'll say zone.\n\n59\n00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,243\nIt's basically the same thing for them.\n\n60\n00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,935\nSo they have 17 regions around the world,\nand\n\n61\n00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:56,390\nI've got their as your regions page\npulled up here does kind of show you.\n\n62\n00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,220\nThey give these like white circles here.\n\n63\n00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,720\nEach one of these is one\nof their regions and\n\n64\n00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,618\na region is a fully\nautonomous data center.\n\n65\n00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,690\nSo it's gonna have servers and other\nresources that are all kind of spread out.\n\n66\n00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,260\nYou'll see they have two down here in\nAustralia, down in Southeast Asia,\n\n67\n00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,260\nChina, Japan, over in Europe,\nseveral here in the United States,\n\n68\n00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,940\nas well as in Brazil and South America.\n\n69\n00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,740\nSo data centers all over to\nmake sure that you can get\n\n70\n00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,840\nthe maximum redundancy possible as well as\nto get your data close to your customers.\n\n71\n00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,550\nYou might be in an American company but\nyou have a lot of customers in Australia.\n\n72\n00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,860\nOr you might be a British company and\n\n73\n00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,810\nyou've got a lot of\ncustomers over in China.\n\n74\n00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,140\nSo you want that data to be\nclose to your customers so\n\n75\n00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,610\nthat they can get reliable and\nquick access to it.\n\n76\n00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,910\nNow Microsoft, they list out a whole bunch\nof stuff here, but they break down each of\n\n77\n00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,910\nthose regions because it is important\nto a little bit more about some of it.\n\n78\n00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,090\nFor example their Virginia region.\n\n79\n00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,770\nThere's two regions in the same place.\n\n80\n00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,980\nThere's the East US and East US two.\n\n81\n00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,830\nThey're two completely\nseparate facilities,\n\n82\n00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,110\ncompletely separate power, network,\nstaff, everything complete.\n\n83\n00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,930\nThey might as well be in two separate\ncities as independent as they are and\n\n84\n00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,330\nthey do that again for redundancy.\n\n85\n00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,830\nIf one data center has an issue,\nthe other takes over.\n\n86\n00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,560\nBut you don't have to rely on multiple\nregions in the same location like this.\n\n87\n00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,290\nYou can spread it out.\n\n88\n00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,640\nYou can have one in Iowa, Virginia,\nIllinois, so there's ones all\n\n89\n00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,190\nover the place that you can choose based\non where you want your data to reside.\n\n90\n00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,900\nNow, they do have some\nspecialized regions.\n\n91\n00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,720\nNotice there's like, U.S government Iowa,\nU.S government Virginia.\n\n92\n00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,790\nThose are ones that are reserved for\nuse by the United States government.\n\n93\n00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,710\nThe U.S government said hey,\nif we're going to host stuff in the Cloud,\n\n94\n00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,630\nwe've got to be able to guarantee\nthat our servers are safe and\n\n95\n00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,150\nisolated from your other customers.\n\n96\n00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,480\nSo they created some\ndedicated data centers.\n\n97\n00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,310\nSo just because there are 17 data centers\n\n98\n00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,680\ndoesn't mean that you have\naccess to all of them.\n\n99\n00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,920\nOftentimes, you'll find you only\nhave access to maybe nine or\n\n100\n00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,880\nten and\na lot of times that's based on capacity.\n\n101\n00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,930\nOthers might be a full capacity so\nyou can't add new servers there.\n\n102\n00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,970\nIt might be because of\nother certain policies.\n\n103\n00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,600\nThe Australian ones are like that.\n\n104\n00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,520\nFor example, if I wanted to spin up a\nserver right now, unless I have a billing\n\n105\n00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,400\naddress in Australia they won't let me\nspin up instances down in Australia.\n\n106\n00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,943\nAnd the reason is that the data is pretty\nexpensive for them they want to service\n\n107\n00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:15,281\nthe local customer first, before they\nopen it up to the rest of the world.\n\n108\n00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,558\nAnd in time, they will open that\nto the rest of the world and\n\n109\n00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,010\nyou'll see that become available.\n\n110\n00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,790\nSo lots of different data centers\nthat are spread out there.\n\n111\n00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,950\nNow, when we talk about a data center.\n\n112\n00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,210\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n113\n00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,990\nWell it's the primary advantage of Cloud.\n\n114\n00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,710\nWhen you go to the Cloud, you're\nbasically outsourcing some of your stuff.\n\n115\n00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,369\nIf you're saying, I'm tired of maintaining\nmy old hardware, paying the electric bill,\n\n116\n00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:42,530\ntrying to keep my servers up and\nrunning, taking my backups.\n\n117\n00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,750\nI'm tired of all that.\n\n118\n00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,830\nI want somebody else to take it over for\nme.\n\n119\n00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,090\nAnd that's what Microsoft is doing.\n\n120\n00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,100\nMicrosoft, it's not a guarantee but\n\n121\n00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,725\nthey more than likely have more\nmoney than the company you work for.\n\n122\n00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For a company like ours,\n\n123\n00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,972\nthat's not even close.\n\n124\n00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:56,793\n>> It's given.\n\n125\n00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> But maybe you work for\n\n126\n00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,590\none of the big oil manufacturers,\nI don't know.\n\n127\n00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,490\nBut they've got a lot of resources\nthat most of us don't, and\n\n128\n00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,050\nso when they build a data\ncenter it's impressive.\n\n129\n00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,561\nAnd a lot of people don't realize\nhow impressive these things are.\n\n130\n00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:13,600\nSo I wanna show you guys that\nI've got a little slide show.\n\n131\n00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,575\nMicrosoft has a guided tour on their\ndata center webpage that you can go and\n\n132\n00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,950\nview, it's a ten minute video.\n\n133\n00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,171\nI went ahead and grabbed some screenshots\nout of it just to kind of show you.\n\n134\n00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:27,500\nWhen you host your servers in Microsoft\nAzure, what those data centers are?\n\n135\n00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,390\nAre these are these warehouses.\n\n136\n00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,950\nAnd in the warehouses\nthey have these boxes,\n\n137\n00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,220\nthey're almost like truck trailers\nthat are stacked full of servers.\n\n138\n00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,130\nAnd this pictures from\ninside of one of those.\n\n139\n00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,950\nAnd what you'll see here\nare literally thousands of servers\n\n140\n00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,510\nin one of these containers,\nthey can fit up to 2400 servers,\n\n141\n00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,640\n2400 servers jammed in\none of these trailers.\n\n142\n00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,030\nAnd that trailer is rigged for\nair conditioning,\n\n143\n00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,410\nwater cooling, electric,\nnetwork, internet bandwidth.\n\n144\n00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,160\nAll of that is hooked up.\n\n145\n00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,230\nI mentioned water.\n\n146\n00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,960\nIt's all water cooled.\n\n147\n00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,010\nIt's so many servers that they can't\nproperly condition it with normal\n\n148\n00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,830\nair conditioning.\n\n149\n00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,870\nSo they use water cooling to get all\nthe heat out of that trailer and\n\n150\n00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,190\nout into the data center itself.\n\n151\n00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,420\nThen they have regular air conditioners\ninside of the data center.\n\n152\n00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,750\nNow, when I say regular air conditioners,\nI'm talking about these.\n\n153\n00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,470\nNow, that's not what we have in our homes.\n\n154\n00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,600\nThese are our commercial grade\nchillers that are designed to\n\n155\n00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,190\ncool large data center.\n\n156\n00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,640\nThis is not something that most of\nour companies have or that we could\n\n157\n00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,190\nafford to put in a lot of cases but\nMicrosoft can and they already have.\n\n158\n00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,890\nSo when you use their Cloud service,\n\n159\n00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,660\nyou're getting access to\nall of this hardware.\n\n160\n00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,150\nNow, air conditioning is one part,\nbattery backup is another.\n\n161\n00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,300\nIf you have 2,400 servers and you want\nthem to stay on while the power is out,\n\n162\n00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,451\nit's gonna take a little bit of battery.\n\n163\n00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:50,796\nSo they have UPSs and hundreds,\nreally tens of thousands, probably 12-volt\n\n164\n00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:56,082\nbatteries all lined up to be able to back\nthese servers up and keep them running.\n\n165\n00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:59,741\nWhile there's a power outage until they\ncan either correct the power outage or\n\n166\n00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,760\nuntil the generators kick in.\n\n167\n00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,340\nThey have numerous generators.\n\n168\n00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,410\nThese are diesel generators that can\npower the data center for days on end so\n\n169\n00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,330\nthose UPS's.\n\n170\n00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,620\nAll those battery racks\nthat I just showed you.\n\n171\n00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,740\nThose normally only have to run for\na few minutes.\n\n172\n00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,460\nIf the power goes out these batteries\nare keeping your servers on line\n\n173\n00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,130\nwhile the generators power on.\n\n174\n00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,950\nAnd once the generators power on,\nnow you're running on diesel fuel and\n\n175\n00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,020\nthey can run for days.\n\n176\n00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,790\nThey actually have giant diesel tanks\nburied in the ground that store enough\n\n177\n00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,890\nfuel to run for many many days and\nkeep that data center up without power.\n\n178\n00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,300\nBut the reality is they have power drawn\ninto the data center from more than one\n\n179\n00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,080\npower grid and most of Microsoft is\nsomething they're very proud of.\n\n180\n00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,943\nNot all of their data centers but\n\n181\n00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:45,890\ntheir biggest data centers\nare all 100% hydroelectric.\n\n182\n00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,750\nThey're powered by completely\nrenewable water energy.\n\n183\n00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,810\nThere's dams nearby that use water\nturbines to generate electricity so\n\n184\n00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,170\nit's very green you know,\nit is good for the environment.\n\n185\n00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,390\n>> Small carbon footprint.\n\n186\n00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,130\n>> Not only is it good,\nit's not bad for the environment.\n\n187\n00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,630\n>> There we go.\n\n188\n00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,940\n>> So\nthese are all things that are happening.\n\n189\n00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,610\nAnd when you go inside\nof their data center,\n\n190\n00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,700\nwhich they won't allow you to do but\nI should probably throw that out there.\n\n191\n00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,840\nBut if you were to somehow manage to get\ninto the data center through some massive\n\n192\n00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,805\nbreach of security,\nwhat you would actually see is this.\n\n193\n00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:20,745\nIt's a giant empty warehouse,\npacked full of these trailers,\n\n194\n00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:23,415\nthese two story trailers, and\nthose, if you look at them,\n\n195\n00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:25,615\nare the same kind of thing\nthat you might see stocked.\n\n196\n00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,685\nWell, they're cargo containers, like where\nyou see all of those giant ships that\n\n197\n00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,585\nsails the seas between countries or\n\n198\n00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:35,055\nthey stick on the back of semi trailers\nfor transport, but inside of them,\n\n199\n00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:39,630\n2400 servers right here,\nOh, 2400 more right here.\n\n200\n00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,740\nMore here, more here,\n\n201\n00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,260\nthere are tens of thousands of\nservers in this one data center.\n\n202\n00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,190\nAnd the coolest part is, because they're\nall compartmentalized like this,\n\n203\n00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,560\nif they want to build a new data center,\nthey just build a big warehouse and\n\n204\n00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,670\nthey drop more of these containers there.\n\n205\n00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,370\nAnd if one data center is getting\nbusier than another, they can\n\n206\n00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,070\ntake some of these trailers away from one\ndata center and move them to another.\n\n207\n00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,020\nOr just deploy them quickly.\n\n208\n00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,410\nSo Microsoft has built a really\nmodular data center environment\n\n209\n00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,540\nthat they can quickly scale and\ngrow to meet the needs of their customers.\n\n210\n00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,630\nThat's power, it's really impressive.\n\n211\n00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,900\n>> Now how often would you say that they\nprobably employ one of these sea crates,\n\n212\n00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,580\nor whatever they are?\n\n213\n00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,730\n>> All the time.\n\n214\n00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,330\n>> All the time.\n\n215\n00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,980\n>> All the time, every time I've seen\na picture of a Microsoft data center,\n\n216\n00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,460\nthere has always been at least\none of these that was going in.\n\n217\n00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,250\nSo, as they get more customers,\nas their service becomes more popular,\n\n218\n00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,960\nthey've got to add more server storage,\nmore resources.\n\n219\n00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,320\nAnd so it's more these containers\nthat are being brought in.\n\n220\n00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,450\nSo you'll see them adding these in all the\ntime, and when they add a new data center,\n\n221\n00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,590\nobviously, they have to add a lot of them.\n\n222\n00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,870\nBut when it's just a regular,\nrun of the mill, running data center.\n\n223\n00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,770\nThey can expand that capacity so\nI wanted you guys to see that the other\n\n224\n00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,470\nthing is when you use their data centers\nyou're not just getting the hardware\n\n225\n00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,050\nyou're also getting their security\npolicies and procedures and other things.\n\n226\n00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,780\nMicrosoft they know how to secure\ntheir own operating system.\n\n227\n00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,450\nThey have some of the most\ntalented staff available in\n\n228\n00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,420\nthe entire world working for them.\n\n229\n00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,350\nSo you know the servers\nare properly configured.\n\n230\n00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,230\nThey also bring in third party auditors\nto review the equipment and the operating\n\n231\n00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,980\nsystems, and as a result, they've got\na number of different certifications.\n\n232\n00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,148\nThey're ISO/IEC 2701.\n\n233\n00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:21,810\nThey're PCI standards SSAE 16.\n\n234\n00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,950\nThat used to be the SAS 70.\n\n235\n00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,030\nSo they've got several\ndifferent certifications.\n\n236\n00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,190\nAnd they maintain that so\nyou don't have to, right?\n\n237\n00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,650\nYou host your servers there and\n\n238\n00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,550\nyou know that you're compliant\naccording to those various standards.\n\n239\n00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,640\nThat's really,\n\n240\n00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,870\nreally valuable when it comes to managing\nsomething like a Cloud service like this.\n\n241\n00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,555\nAnd that's all done through,\nwhoops, if I can.\n\n242\n00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:46,440\n[LAUGH] All done through Azure.\n\n243\n00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,330\nThere we go.\nIf I can work a web browser.\n\n244\n00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,760\n>> And it's not just Microsoft\nsaying yeah, we're good to go.\n\n245\n00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,770\nYou can trust us.\n\n246\n00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,050\nThey're having people come in and\n\n247\n00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,850\naudit them making sure this stuff is\nrunning the way you expect it to you.\n\n248\n00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,480\n>> Now those slides that I showed you.\n\n249\n00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,510\nThose actually came from a tour\nvideo that's on Microsoft's website.\n\n250\n00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,430\nIf you go to their data center website.\n\n251\n00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,470\nThey've got this take a tour\nof Microsoft's data centers.\n\n252\n00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,640\nIt's ten minutes long, and they show\nyou some of the different data centers,\n\n253\n00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,490\nand the cool part is their are videos\nfrom inside of a building or\n\n254\n00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,620\nseveral buildings that normally\nno one would have access to.\n\n255\n00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,810\nThese are very secretive,\nclosed off buildings.\n\n256\n00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,410\nWhen you watch that footage of the outside\nthe buildings, and there's no signs.\n\n257\n00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,210\nRight.\nThey don't they don't\n\n258\n00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,010\npost big signs like this is\nthe Microsoft data center.\n\n259\n00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,440\nThey don't want people to know that.\n\n260\n00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,290\nSo it's really neat to get some insight.\n\n261\n00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,310\nMicrosoft's been often pretty open about\nthat, and it's a fun one to watch.\n\n262\n00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,840\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,810\nNow, when you host with Azure,\nthey have a ton of services available, and\n\n264\n00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,865\nit's really up to you.\n\n265\n00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:43,315\nHow deep you're gonna get\ninto Microsoft Azure.\n\n266\n00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:45,935\nYou might want to just host\na couple of servers there.\n\n267\n00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,355\nYou might want to move your entire\nIT infrastructure up to Azure.\n\n268\n00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:53,925\nYou might wanna just put some files there,\nso that other people can download them.\n\n269\n00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:57,345\nThe cool part about Azure is it's\ncompletely built around a pay\n\n270\n00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,605\nas you go model.\n\n271\n00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,530\nYou only pay for what you use.\n\n272\n00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,520\nLet me pull up their pricing page.\n\n273\n00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,380\nMicrosoft is really transparent\non the pricing with this.\n\n274\n00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,910\nBasically there's no upfront cost.\n\n275\n00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,170\nYou don't pay anything to sign up.\n\n276\n00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,180\nThere's no contract.\n\n277\n00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,020\nYou can cancel whenever you want right?\n\n278\n00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,955\nSo it literally is pay for what you use.\n\n279\n00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:18,665\nIf you've got five servers running this\nhour, you pay for those five servers.\n\n280\n00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,765\nIf you shut them all down you\ndon't pay for them the next hour.\n\n281\n00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,715\nWell if you save the storage, you have to\npay for that I guess, but you know, RAM,\n\n282\n00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,775\nCPU, that stuff,\nyou don't want to pay for.\n\n283\n00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:30,105\nSo when you go to their website,\nthat's how everything is structured.\n\n284\n00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:33,045\nIt's all based around these hourly rates.\n\n285\n00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,440\nAnd so if I come in here and I say I\nwant to bring up some virtual machines.\n\n286\n00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,500\nWell maybe I want some Windows virtual\nmachines and some Linux virtual machines.\n\n287\n00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,570\nThey're gonna be priced a little bit\ndifferently because of the operating\n\n288\n00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,380\nsystem licences.\n\n289\n00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,970\nAnd if I look at my Windows virtual\nmachines and we come down here,\n\n290\n00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,580\nyou'll see that we're\npaying based on resources.\n\n291\n00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,640\nIf I want four CPUs and seven gigs of RAM,\n\n292\n00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,230\nthat's probably what your average,\none user server is if you buy them today.\n\n293\n00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,740\nThey're gonna charge you just\na hair more than $0.30 per hour.\n\n294\n00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,880\nOr if you run that 24 hours a day,\nthat's $229 a month, right?\n\n295\n00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,500\nThat's what they're going to charge you.\n\n296\n00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,120\nYou shut the server off,\nyou're not paying for it anymore.\n\n297\n00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,710\nIf you buy a physical server you're\npaying for it all the time or\n\n298\n00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,350\nyou've paid for it up front.\n\n299\n00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,970\nHere, not only are you paying it spread\nout over the course of the year,\n\n300\n00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,190\nwhich is kind of nice.\n\n301\n00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,220\nBut you can stop that\npayment whenever you want.\n\n302\n00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,640\nIf you want to bump up to eight\nC.P.U.s and 14 gigs of RAM you can and\n\n303\n00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,270\nit just goes up to about\n$0.61 cents an hour.\n\n304\n00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,440\nWell if I would of did that\nwith physical servers.\n\n305\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,690\nI'd have to go and do an upgrade.\n\n306\n00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,980\nWell upgrading RAM,\nthat's not a big deal right, Daniel?\n\n307\n00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,190\nBut have you ever\nupgraded CPU on a server?\n\n308\n00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,632\n>> No,\nI've never had to actually do a CPU.\n\n309\n00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:43,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well if you even can,\n\n310\n00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,710\nit's a nightmare, because you've got to\nget the right family and stepping of CPU.\n\n311\n00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,830\nIt's a real challenge to get the proper\nprocessor, and you normally have to buy it\n\n312\n00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,320\nfrom from that manufacturer, and\nthey charge an arm and a leg for it.\n\n313\n00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160\nIt's not an easy thing.\n\n314\n00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,250\nWe can't normally upgrade CPU's.\n\n315\n00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,540\nAnd if your server has four sockets in\nit you can't just add four more sockets.\n\n316\n00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,490\nYou have to buy a new motherboard, which\nusually means buying a new server, so\n\n317\n00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,765\nthat's not even an upgrade that's\npossible, with Azure it is.\n\n318\n00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:11,345\nYou say hey, my server's got four CPUs,\nlet's go ahead and double that to eight.\n\n319\n00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,465\nAnd it's just clicking some buttons,\nthe server reboots, and\n\n320\n00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:15,315\nyou've got eight processors.\n\n321\n00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,705\nSo it's that easy,\nthat's the cool stuff about this.\n\n322\n00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,475\nAnd it's pretty reasonably priced\ncompared to physical servers.\n\n323\n00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:24,425\n>> Yeah, I like the fact that they\nactually give you the ability to\n\n324\n00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,005\nkind of be as cost effective\nas you need it to be.\n\n325\n00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:32,200\nAgain, like you said, if I'm not actually\nrunning the server then I'm not paying for\n\n326\n00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,730\nthe RAM, I'm not paying for\nthe CPU time, I might be paying for\n\n327\n00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,110\na little bit of storage.\n\n328\n00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,030\nBut if I really learn how I'm going\nto use the server in real time and\n\n329\n00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,165\nsay well I can turn it off from\nthese times to these times.\n\n330\n00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:47,675\nIt's only used for a certain\nreason then I'm saving that cost,\n\n331\n00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:51,646\nall I need is to pay for that storage,\ncan make it really cost effective.\n\n332\n00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:55,011\n>> Absolutely and you know speaking of\ncost effective one of the things that\n\n333\n00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,721\na lot of people don't realize about Azure\nis that Microsoft did embrace Linux.\n\n334\n00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,562\nSo they've got Linux the open source OS.\n\n335\n00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,908\nHosted.\nYou can whip up Linux VMs and\n\n336\n00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,170\nthey do a great job of it.\n\n337\n00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,930\nAnd they're less expensive and cheaper so\nif you want to save some money and\n\n338\n00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,520\nyou can use Linux servers then you should\nI've got their Linux pricing full up here.\n\n339\n00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,740\nRemember a four CPU seven\nGig RAM Windows machine.\n\n340\n00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,670\nWas gonna cost 30 cents an hour.\n\n341\n00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,370\nThat same Linux machine\nis only 18 cents an hour.\n\n342\n00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,290\nOr if I go to eight CPUs in fourteen\ngigs of RAM, it's only 37 cents an hour.\n\n343\n00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,810\nIt was 61 cents for a Windows one,\n37 cents for Linux.\n\n344\n00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,280\nSame hardware,\nsame resources on the back end.\n\n345\n00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,030\nThe only difference is that\noperating system license, and so\n\n346\n00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,590\nthat's a big part of it.\n\n347\n00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,500\nYour licensing is completely covered\nby Microsoft when you pick an OS\n\n348\n00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,130\nit's absorbed into that price and that's\n\n349\n00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,640\nreally useful when you're doing things\nlike running an Oracle database or a SQL.\n\n350\n00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,590\nMicrosoft SQL databases they host those\nnatively when you whip one of those up,\n\n351\n00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,960\nthe license is rolled into that cost,\nright?\n\n352\n00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,920\nSo, pretty cool to do,\npretty easy to implement.\n\n353\n00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,530\n>> Yeah, I've noticed that the Microsoft\nlicensing procedure can be\n\n354\n00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,750\nabout as easy as brain surgery.\n\n355\n00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,680\nA lot of times it's very difficult to\nfigure out what kind of license do I need.\n\n356\n00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,380\nHow many seats?\n\n357\n00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,100\nHow many per this, how many per that?\n\n358\n00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,140\nSo it's easy for just to let them\nsay well here's the servers I need.\n\n359\n00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,790\nGo ahead and do that licensing for\nme and I'll appreciate it.\n\n360\n00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,130\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n361\n00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,430\nSo when you decide to go with Azure.\n\n362\n00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,340\nWell one of the things you have to decide\nis which Cloud provider am I gonna use?\n\n363\n00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,760\nMaybe you want to use Amazon Web Services\nor Rackspace or Azure.\n\n364\n00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,290\nWhen you decide to go with\nAzure your next decision is\n\n365\n00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,990\nwhat resources am I going\nto take advantage of and\n\n366\n00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,740\nthey've got a number of them the really\nneed I've got my Azure management portal\n\n367\n00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,700\npulled up here and you'll see\nwhere we can do Virtual Machines.\n\n368\n00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,550\nThat's what a lot of us think\nof we think of clouds service.\n\n369\n00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,520\nI'm gonna spin up some servers right.\n\n370\n00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,420\nBut maybe I want simple databases.\n\n371\n00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,560\nMaybe file storage to be able to load some\nfiles up there and have people be able to\n\n372\n00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,920\ndownload them but I want downloads\nto happen all across the world.\n\n373\n00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,030\nMaybe I want meta data and metrics right?\n\n374\n00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,300\nHD inside will do that.\n\n375\n00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,720\nWe've got media services if we're\ngonna be streaming and encoding video.\n\n376\n00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,050\nAnd pushing that out.\n\n377\n00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,330\nYou can do that.\n\n378\n00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,850\nVisual Studio online.\n\n379\n00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,650\nIf I have a team of developers and\nI need a source code repository with rapid\n\n380\n00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,470\ncompiling and unit tests and all that.\n\n381\n00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,730\nIt can do all that.\n\n382\n00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,740\nWe've got BizTalk.\n\n383\n00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,740\nSome Microsoft products,\nlet me just through this in here,\n\n384\n00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,260\nare very powerful and\ndarn near impossible to install.\n\n385\n00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,500\nBizTalk and\nShare Point are two examples of that.\n\n386\n00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,620\nBizTalk, very very powerful.\n\n387\n00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,390\nIt's a bear to get that thing set up and\ninstalled and configured properly.\n\n388\n00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,930\nWell in here I can choose\nBizTalk services and\n\n389\n00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,650\nI can spin those up in a moment's notice.\n\n390\n00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,120\nSame thing with SharePoint, you can\nfire those things up and get them up and\n\n391\n00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,410\nrunning and it's just a breeze.\n\n392\n00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,020\nIt really does make life a lot easier.\n\n393\n00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,190\nSo tons of features you'll\nsee as I scroll down here,\n\n394\n00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,220\nthere's just a lot of\nstuff buried away in here.\n\n395\n00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,260\nYou don't have to use it all.\n\n396\n00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,200\nYou might find in the beginning you\njust use one particular service.\n\n397\n00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,160\nA great one to start with\nis Azure site recovery.\n\n398\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,340\nLet me pull up their page real quick.\n\n399\n00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,750\nAzure site recovery.\n\n400\n00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,000\nWhat it does is it allows you to back\nup your physical servers to Azure.\n\n401\n00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,250\nSo you've got your physical servers\nright there in your own data center\n\n402\n00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,120\nrunning like normal.\n\n403\n00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,370\nRight, you're not using the cloud at all.\n\n404\n00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,480\nAnd then you deploy Azure site recovery.\n\n405\n00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,660\nIt starts backing up your physical\nservers to the Azure cloud,\n\n406\n00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,740\nit's just backing you up, right?\n\n407\n00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,370\nYour production servers run like normal,\nnothing different, right?\n\n408\n00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,550\nYour backups are going to the cloud,\nnow you've got off site backups,\n\n409\n00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,139\nand that's a great thing.\n\n410\n00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,910\nThen if some kind of disaster happens your\ndata centers wiped out you lose all your\n\n411\n00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,670\nservers you go to the Azure site recovery\npage and hit this wake up button and\n\n412\n00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,370\nit spins up all your servers right there\nin Azure in your entire data center is now\n\n413\n00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,980\nup and running in Azure it's\ndisaster recovery to the you know\n\n414\n00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,170\nsuper powered degree right it's up and\nit's running.\n\n415\n00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,800\nYou just built a complete off-site\ndisaster recovery center to get your\n\n416\n00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,830\nbusiness running again right after\na disaster, and they made it super easy.\n\n417\n00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,050\nI know some people have actually used\nthat to transition to the Cloud.\n\n418\n00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,950\nThey say, here, I'm gonna start\nbacking up my service to the Cloud.\n\n419\n00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,750\nAnd then, I'm not actually can have a\ndisaster, but I'm gonna flip that switch.\n\n420\n00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,150\nAnd now all my servers are up there.\n\n421\n00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,920\nWow, I just migrated to the Cloud.\n\n422\n00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,260\nSo they make things really easy like that.\n\n423\n00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,520\nIt is super powerful.\n\n424\n00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,010\nWith Azure site recovery,\nthe neat thing here,\n\n425\n00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,650\nif you've ever set up disaster recovery\nbefore, if I have a server running here\n\n426\n00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,710\nand I need it in an off-site location,\nI need a second server.\n\n427\n00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,060\nI've gotta buy two servers.\n\n428\n00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,610\nOne for production, one for\ndisaster recovery, and\n\n429\n00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,840\nthe one on disaster recovery's\njust sitting there doing nothing.\n\n430\n00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,590\nAnd if an entire year goes by and\nI don't have a disaster,\n\n431\n00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,440\nthat other service sat there and\ndid nothing that whole time right.\n\n432\n00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,750\nBut when I need it I really need it.\n\n433\n00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,780\nYou appreciate that\nserver when you need it.\n\n434\n00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,040\nBut when you don't need it, it's easy\nto look at it as a waste of money.\n\n435\n00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,262\nWith Azure you back your data up to\nthem and you're just paying for storage.\n\n436\n00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,802\nYou're not paying for CPU and RAM.\n\n437\n00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:49,541\nYou're not paying for hardware,\nmaintenance, warranty, power.\n\n438\n00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,221\nAny of that stuff.\n\n439\n00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,440\nYou're just paying for storage.\n\n440\n00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,970\nAnd then when a disaster does happen and\n\n441\n00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,900\nyou flip over, then it spins up the CPU\nand the RAM and all those resources that\n\n442\n00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,310\nyou know Microsoft has tons of, and\nyou grab and you're able to use it.\n\n443\n00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,140\nSo on a positive side, you're not paying\nfor hardware that you're not using, and\n\n444\n00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,700\nif you don't have a disaster,\nyou just pay for the storage,\n\n445\n00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,890\nand their storage pricing is cheap.\n\n446\n00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,630\nLet me.\n\n447\n00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,130\nI mean, I shouldn't say cheap.\n\n448\n00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,836\nLess expensive [CROSSTALK].\n\n449\n00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:19,299\n[LAUGH] It doesn't sound as nice when\nyou say cheap but if we go in here and\n\n450\n00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:23,992\nwe find their data storage pricing for\njust straight up regular storage,\n\n451\n00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,330\nit's like 10 cents per gig per month.\n\n452\n00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,260\nLet's see if I can find it here.\n\n453\n00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,530\nFor the first terabyte it is,\nwe don't want low redundancy,\n\n454\n00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,710\nwe want zone redundancy.\n\n455\n00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,880\nThere's different level of\nredundant storage, and so\n\n456\n00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,810\nthat's where this LRS, ZRS, GRS is.\n\n457\n00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,890\nSo low redundancy storage means\nthey only maintain one copy of it,\n\n458\n00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,950\nand if that copy fails, it's kind of gone.\n\n459\n00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,350\nSo we don't normally use that.\n\n460\n00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,620\nZone redundant storage means\nthey maintain at least\n\n461\n00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,680\ntwo copies of your data in the same\nregion, in the same data center.\n\n462\n00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,320\nAnd that's normally good enough for\nmost people, so\n\n463\n00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,630\nthat's when you see used most commonly.\n\n464\n00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,340\nA global or geo redundant storage\nis where they maintain at least\n\n465\n00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,410\nthree copies of your data,\ntwo in one data center and\n\n466\n00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,420\none in another data center at\nleast one hundred miles away.\n\n467\n00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,560\nThey get kind of specific with this stuff\nso those are kind of the different tiers.\n\n468\n00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,050\nAnd you see they get more\nexpensive as you go up but ZRS.\n\n469\n00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,240\nThat's the most common at\nthree cents per gigabyte.\n\n470\n00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,590\nI said ten cents only three\ncents per gigabyte per month.\n\n471\n00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,330\nThat's not much money.\n\n472\n00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,200\nYou could have an entire\ndisaster recovery center built up\n\n473\n00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,800\non Microsoft's state of the art data\ncenter ready to go on a moment's notice.\n\n474\n00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,768\nIt costs me three cents per gig per month.\n\n475\n00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,510\nIt's a no brainer.\n\n476\n00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,890\n>> Yeah, and I'm assuming that Microsoft\nis also upgrading the equipment as new,\n\n477\n00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,760\nfaster, better stuff comes out.\n\n478\n00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,570\nSo you're always staying\non top of new hardware.\n\n479\n00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,960\nThat's something like,\nwe had a data center right here.\n\n480\n00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,750\nNew servers came out.\n\n481\n00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,230\nWe got some servers that are three or\nfive years old.\n\n482\n00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,570\nMight be time to decommission those,\nbuy new servers.\n\n483\n00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,640\nDoing a disaster recovery and by those\ntwo to stay on top of new hardware so\n\n484\n00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,930\nit's nice to go this way.\n\n485\n00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,090\n>> Yeah with this we don't worry\nabout hardware anymore you know.\n\n486\n00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,070\nNew CPU's come out big deal\nMicrosoft can get them,\n\n487\n00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,870\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n488\n00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,700\nNow we do still have to worry\nabout our operating systems\n\n489\n00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,530\nyou know Microsoft when we deploy\na virtual machine on their infrastructure.\n\n490\n00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,700\nThey give you Windows or\nthey give you Linux, but\n\n491\n00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,970\nthen it's up to you to support it.\n\n492\n00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,070\nSo you've got to do your updates.\n\n493\n00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,930\nYou've got to do your manuals.\n\n494\n00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,940\nYou've got to install and\nconfigure your own software.\n\n495\n00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,300\nThey can't help you with that.\n\n496\n00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,840\nBut on the hardware side,\nthey knock all that out.\n\n497\n00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,130\nAnd for things like a hosted sequel\ndatabase, they go a little bit further.\n\n498\n00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,620\nNow they take care of\nthe operating system in sequel, and\n\n499\n00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,530\nyou just get exposed to that database.\n\n500\n00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,000\nNow they are taking care\nof more than just hardware.\n\n501\n00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,290\nBut it's up to you to figure\nout what level you want.\n\n502\n00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,760\nAnd because it's contract free,\nit's easy to get in and\n\n503\n00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,880\nget out whenever you need to.\n\n504\n00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880\n>> It's awesome stuff.\n\n505\n00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,740\n>> All right, well, Daniel, I think that's\na pretty good overview of Microsoft Azure\n\n506\n00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,510\nand kind of and what it is, all the\ndifferent components that are inside of\n\n507\n00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,590\nit, and kind of gives everybody a preview\nof it and why you might want to use it.\n\n508\n00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,320\n>> Yeah, it's definitely something\nworthwhile to looking into if you haven't\n\n509\n00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,350\nalready, so\ncheck that out when you get a free minute.\n\n510\n00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,730\nThat being said Don, I guess we've come\nto the end of another episode here.\n\n511\n00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,580\nSo from ITProTV studios signing off.\n\n512\n00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,725\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry and\nI'm Don Pezet and we'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:13,670\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another great episode ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,381\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,261\nHere with me today,\nis the man himself, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,430\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,670\n>> I am doing great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,450\nWe're gonna be diving into\nMicrosoft Azure today.\n\n9\n00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,580\nAnd we're gonna look at bringing\nup some of our first servers.\n\n10\n00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,580\nMost people, if you've signed up for\na Cloud account with the service,\n\n11\n00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,873\nit's one of the first things you wanna do\nis how do I bring up some virtual servers\n\n12\n00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,554\nin this system, so I can start\nhosting my services in the Cloud?\n\n13\n00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:37,760\nSo that's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n14\n00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,365\n>> That's awesome,\nI know I'm really excited about Azure.\n\n15\n00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:43,565\nI've worked with virtualization in\nthe past, but never so much in the Cloud.\n\n16\n00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:45,586\nSo to see how they do it, and\nwhat the difference this is,\n\n17\n00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,990\nthat's gonna be really interesting.\n\n18\n00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,130\nI'm looking forward to it.\n\n19\n00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,765\n>> Yeah, the coolest part is, it's not\nreally all that much different, right?\n\n20\n00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,564\nYeah, sure,\nthat the Web UI we got to get used to,\n\n21\n00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:57,834\nand the menu items as we go to\ncreate this virtual machine,\n\n22\n00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,750\nbut once the VM is up and running,\nit's just a server like any other.\n\n23\n00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,937\nAnd so, all the administration beyond\nthat first stage is icing on the cake.\n\n24\n00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:07,908\nNo big deal at all.\n\n25\n00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,980\nSo let's dive in, and take a look at that.\n\n26\n00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,230\nI'm logged into the Azure panel here,\n\n27\n00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,780\nthe management portal, and you've got all\nyour different services listed over here,\n\n28\n00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,130\nand depending on your subscription,\nyou might have three things.\n\n29\n00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,420\nOr like, if you just have an Office 365\nsubscription, you only see a few things.\n\n30\n00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,470\nOr if you've got a full subscription,\nyou'll have a ton.\n\n31\n00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,790\nIt just depends on what you signed up for,\nwhat all you see here.\n\n32\n00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,870\nBut most of you are gonna see what I'm\nseeing, which is a pretty big list.\n\n33\n00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,550\nOnce you've attached your\ncredit card to that account,\n\n34\n00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,980\nMicrosoft will offer you everything.\n\n35\n00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,410\nSo [LAUGH] you might see a good bit\nin there, and once you jump in,\n\n36\n00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,930\nwhat we're looking for\ntoday are virtual machines right there.\n\n37\n00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,535\nAnd I'll tell you, this is one of\nthe things that I really appreciate\n\n38\n00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,705\nabout Microsoft Azure.\n\n39\n00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:53,695\nThe other services that are out\nthere like Media Temple and\n\n40\n00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:56,185\nAmazon, they all use different names for\ntheir stuff.\n\n41\n00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:59,405\nSo if you wanna create a virtual\nmachine in Amazon, it's an instance.\n\n42\n00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,085\nIf you like create one in Media Temple,\nit's a VPC.\n\n43\n00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,088\nBut in Windows,\nthey just call it a virtual machine, and\n\n44\n00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:05,694\nthat's what most of us\nthink of it as anyway.\n\n45\n00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:07,482\n>> Yeah, that's very helpful for\n\n46\n00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:11,452\nus non-Cloud users that are trying\nto get into that side of things, and\n\n47\n00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:15,642\nmigrate around, or should I say,\nwalk around, look at that new UI for us.\n\n48\n00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:18,115\nSo, that makes things a whole lot easier.\n\n49\n00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n50\n00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,750\nI'm gonna whip up this\nvirtual machine here.\n\n51\n00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,880\nI'll go ahead and\njust hit create a virtual machine.\n\n52\n00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360\nAnd now, it's gonna walk\nme through a simple wizard.\n\n53\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,880\nNow, the wizard is\nalready three screens in,\n\n54\n00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,970\neven though I haven't clicked anything.\n\n55\n00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,810\nAnd the reason is,\nit knew what webpage I was on, and so\n\n56\n00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,670\nit knew what I was about to do.\n\n57\n00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,670\nIt knew that I was about to create\na virtual machine cuz of where I am.\n\n58\n00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,580\nIf I had been on a different\nscreen like the all items screen,\n\n59\n00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,790\nit doesn't know what I'm about to do.\n\n60\n00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,780\nAnd so, if I click this New button\nway down here at the bottom,\n\n61\n00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,120\nI've got to tell it, am I doing a compute\nservice, data service, app service?\n\n62\n00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,370\nAnd then inside of compute, am I doing\na web app, or a virtual machine?\n\n63\n00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,120\nSo, see how I kind of have to tell\nit what I'm trying to do, and\n\n64\n00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,340\nthat's just because it doesn't\nnecessarily know what I want.\n\n65\n00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,720\nSo, it's pretty smart.\n\n66\n00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,240\nIt understands that if you're\nlooking at virtual machines, and\n\n67\n00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,460\nyou hit New, you probably wanna\ncreate a virtual machine.\n\n68\n00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,350\nAnd it get us right into that\nQuick Create, right there.\n\n69\n00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,760\nQuick Create is the easiest way to\nget a standard server fired up.\n\n70\n00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,611\nAnd from my server, I can bring up\nWindows servers, or Linux servers,\n\n71\n00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:17,859\nyou have all sorts of choices.\n\n72\n00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,811\nRight here, you have your images.\n\n73\n00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:25,070\nAnd if I expand that out, you'll see a\npretty decent list of Windows Server 2012,\n\n74\n00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,580\n2008, we have Ubuntu, we've got OpenLogic,\nwhich is a CentOS and Red Hat variant.\n\n75\n00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,590\nWe've got Oracle Linux, CoreOS, and\nthen down here, you got SUSE Linux.\n\n76\n00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,890\nSo, a lot of different choices.\n\n77\n00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,950\nIt's not just a Microsoft world,\n\n78\n00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,840\nwe're not limited to just Windows\nin Azure, you can do Linux also.\n\n79\n00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,157\nI'll start with a Windows Server\n2012 R2 Datacenter.\n\n80\n00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:49,559\nNow normally, you might say to yourself,\nwait a minute, I don't wanna go\n\n81\n00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,690\nDatacenter edition, cuz that's gonna\ncost a lot more, in terms of licensing.\n\n82\n00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,770\nWell with Windows Azure, they've got\nyour operating system license covered.\n\n83\n00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,790\nSo whether you pick Datacenter,\nor Standard, or whatever,\n\n84\n00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,470\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n85\n00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,220\nSo that's why we get Datacenter, and if\nyou look, I don't even have the choice for\n\n86\n00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,710\nStandard, do I?\n\n87\n00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,717\nSo, you can go Datacenter,\nyou get a benefit, it's what you pay for.\n\n88\n00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:15,500\nI need to give the server a name,\nmaybe this is gonna be a web server, so\n\n89\n00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,890\nI'll call it itprotv-web01.\n\n90\n00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,010\nAnd then I pick its size.\n\n91\n00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,480\nNow the size is determining\nhow many CPUs and\n\n92\n00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,690\nhow much RAM the system is going to get.\n\n93\n00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,090\nAnd you can change this after the fact, so\n\n94\n00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,440\nwhat I pick right here\nis not set in stone.\n\n95\n00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,220\nThis is my starting point.\n\n96\n00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,150\nAnd Microsoft will choose by default what\nthey consider to be the recommended,\n\n97\n00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,820\nor like, bare minimum basically for\nthat OS.\n\n98\n00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,570\nSo for me, it's picking 1 core,\n3.5 gigs of RAM.\n\n99\n00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,380\nNow Daniel, have you run Server\n2012 on 1 core and 3.5 gigs of RAM?\n\n100\n00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,044\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:51,594\n>> Most modern servers come out spec'd\n\n102\n00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,502\nhigher than that, and it'll run fine,\n3.5 gigs is pretty good.\n\n103\n00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,593\nI mean, it'd be a little tougher,\nif we have like, 1 gig of RAM.\n\n104\n00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,169\n>> Yeah.\n\n105\n00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,625\n>> So, going lower is not necessarily\nan option for us, but we can go higher.\n\n106\n00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,157\nI might want 14 gigs of RAM, or 32 gigs,\nI don't want to go crazy, right.\n\n107\n00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:08,677\nSo there's all sorts of options in here,\nyou pick based on the size, and know that\n\n108\n00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:12,890\nyou can change it after the fact, right,\nthat's the glory of Cloud services.\n\n109\n00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,680\nBut all that being said,\nI'll leave mine, that one.\n\n110\n00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,485\nThen I need a default username.\n\n111\n00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:20,998\nSo it's gonna create a user account on the\nsystem for me to be able to connect in and\n\n112\n00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:21,527\nmanage it.\n\n113\n00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:24,440\nSo I'll create an account for\nme, I'll just do dpezet.\n\n114\n00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,700\nAnd I'll punch in a nice, secure password.\n\n115\n00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,005\nThe same one I use on every show.\n\n116\n00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:30,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n117\n00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,560\nthen lastly,\n[LAUGH] I need to pick an affinity group.\n\n118\n00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,203\nThe affinity group, that's saying what\ndatacenter is this going to go into.\n\n119\n00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,454\nMicrosoft has a couple of datacenters\naround the world and you'll see,\n\n120\n00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:43,000\nlike, North Europe, East US, Central US.\n\n121\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,380\nWe've got West Europe,\nEast Asia, Southeast Asia,\n\n122\n00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,910\nJapan, a couple of different\nones to pick from.\n\n123\n00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,470\nWe're in Florida, so\nI want the server to be near me.\n\n124\n00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,985\nSo I'll pick one that's US East,\nor East US.\n\n125\n00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:00,381\nI might want one that's as far away from\nme as possible though, maybe this is for\n\n126\n00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,305\ndisaster recovery.\n\n127\n00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:04,713\nI don't want it near Florida anywhere, so\nI might pick something on the West Coast,\n\n128\n00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:05,250\nor in Japan.\n\n129\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,369\nI'll just get as far as we can,\nso well, maybe China.\n\n130\n00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,920\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n>> I don't know, whatever.\n\n131\n00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,420\nBut you pick something far away, and then\nnow you've got that server on the other\n\n132\n00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,119\nside of the planet from you, but\nI'll go East US for this one.\n\n133\n00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,370\nOnce that's done,\nit's provisioning the server.\n\n134\n00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,340\nIt's actually creating a virtual machine,\n\n135\n00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,164\ndeploying an image on it that has\nWindows Server 2012 R2 Enterprise Edition,\n\n136\n00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:30,865\nthat's a mouthful, already installed\n[LAUGH] up there on the system.\n\n137\n00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:34,610\nIt's creating my user account for\nme, so that'll be there, and\n\n138\n00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,180\ngetting the system ready for access.\n\n139\n00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,630\nJust like that.\n\n140\n00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,460\nWhile we're waiting on that,\n\n141\n00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,980\nI'm gonna repeat the process, but\nthis time I'm gonna do a Linux box.\n\n142\n00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,595\nSo I'll go down here to New > Compute\n> Virtual Machine > Quick Create, but\n\n143\n00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,364\nthis time I'm gonna pick, we'll go Ubuntu,\n\n144\n00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:53,840\nwe'll do one of the long\nterm service ones.\n\n145\n00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,630\nAnd I'll call this one itprotv-web02.\n\n146\n00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,327\nNotice, the hardware requirements here are\nlisted, they're lower, 1 core, 1.75 gigs.\n\n147\n00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:07,870\nAnd that's cuz the Linux distros, they\nhave a lower required amount of resources,\n\n148\n00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,700\nso they can actually get away with less.\n\n149\n00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,667\nAnd we could bump that up if we needed to,\nbut yeah, where it set is fine.\n\n150\n00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,640\nAnd I'll create a user account, now here,\nit doesn't let me pick the username.\n\n151\n00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,990\nSee, how it's creating a user\naccount called azureuser?\n\n152\n00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,110\nSo I can create more accounts on my\nown after I get into the server, but\n\n153\n00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,150\nthe default account is just\ngonna be called azureuser.\n\n154\n00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,120\nAnd so, I'll provide a password for that.\n\n155\n00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,610\nAnd so we'll have it available.\n\n156\n00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,960\nAnd then I'll pick an affinity group.\n\n157\n00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,250\nI'll stick this one in East US also.\n\n158\n00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,693\nMight as well put all\nmy eggs in one basket.\n\n159\n00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n160\n00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,220\nthat's gonna spin that one up.\n\n161\n00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,420\nNow both these are just\nbase operating systems.\n\n162\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,500\nWell, it's not truly base.\n\n163\n00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,446\nIt's the operating system\nplus the Azure additions,\n\n164\n00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:51,966\nto make it play nice with the Web UI\nin the farm, and the Cloud, and\n\n165\n00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:55,380\nall that other stuff that's out\nthere the Azure Datacenters.\n\n166\n00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,300\nBut other than that,\nthere's no third party software on these.\n\n167\n00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,131\nIf I want this to be a web server, I'm\ngonna need to install IIS on the Microsoft\n\n168\n00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:06,050\none, or I'm gonna need to\ninstall Apache on the Linux one.\n\n169\n00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,100\nSo there's some configuration I'm gonna\nhave to do to get these servers set\n\n170\n00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,310\nthe way that I want them.\n\n171\n00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,350\nBut as far as getting the server itself,\nit's no big deal.\n\n172\n00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,720\nNow if you look at my status,\nsee how the service has stopped?\n\n173\n00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,650\nSo itprotv-web01 is stopped.\n\n174\n00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,700\nIt actually is starting or\nit's about to start.\n\n175\n00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,470\nThat just means it\nfinished provisioning it.\n\n176\n00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,960\nIt's done creating the server,\nand now it's ready to boot it up.\n\n177\n00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,060\nAnd it will do that automatically\non its own if we wait long enough.\n\n178\n00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,440\nOr you can sit here and\nrefresh your screen or whatever, and\n\n179\n00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,480\neventually it will update.\n\n180\n00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,260\nBut basically I've got those two\nservers now, and they're spinning up.\n\n181\n00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,230\nNow, that's two typical, average,\nrun of the mill servers.\n\n182\n00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,940\nThere are some pre-built\nservers we can deploy,\n\n183\n00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,890\nthat do have additional\nsoftware installed on them.\n\n184\n00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,270\nYou might have noticed\nwhen I was in that wizard\n\n185\n00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,850\nwhere I went to Compute >\nVirtual Machine > Quick Create.\n\n186\n00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,220\nRight beneath it we have from gallery.\n\n187\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,310\nThis is the Azure Server gallery.\n\n188\n00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,500\nAnd the server gallery lets you\npick from pre-built images.\n\n189\n00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,690\nThere's the images that we saw just\na moment ago, those operating systems.\n\n190\n00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,270\nAnd then there's a lot more.\n\n191\n00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,590\nYou can pick and\nchoose over here from software,\n\n192\n00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,900\nmostly from Microsoft, that they can\nhave pre-installed and pre-configured.\n\n193\n00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,280\nSo for example if I need a SQL server,\nI can choose that.\n\n194\n00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,200\nAnd here's a deployment of Windows Server\n2012 R2 with SQL Server 2014.\n\n195\n00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,780\nalready installed and optimized for\ntransactional workloads or optimized for\n\n196\n00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,640\ndata warehousing, already set up for us.\n\n197\n00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,405\nKinda nice, isn't it?\n\n198\n00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:30,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n199\n00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,260\nThey're kind of doing all the grunt\nwork for us out of the gate.\n\n200\n00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,640\n>> They really are and\nsome of the stuff is a pain like BizTalk.\n\n201\n00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640\nDid we see that, yeah,\nBizTalk right there.\n\n202\n00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,420\nBizTalk is a pain to get set up.\n\n203\n00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,850\nIt's tons of software all linked together.\n\n204\n00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,820\nThey've already done it.\n\n205\n00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,870\nWe just deploy the image and then we go in\nand configure it to suit our needs, and\n\n206\n00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,510\nthat makes life a lot easier.\n\n207\n00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,235\nI'll do Share Point,\nShare Point's awesome.\n\n208\n00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Share Point's probably my least\n\n209\n00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,520\nfavorite product from any vendor.\n\n210\n00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,000\nBut if you ever install Share Point,\nthere's a lot of pieces there.\n\n211\n00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,910\nThere's the Web UI,\nthere's the SQL database on the back end.\n\n212\n00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,400\nAnd maybe you're not a DBA.\n\n213\n00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,960\nMaybe you don't know the first\nthing about Microsoft SQL, but\n\n214\n00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,170\nyou need a SharePoint server up right now.\n\n215\n00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,520\nWell this will deploy\nSharePoint Server 2013.\n\n216\n00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,090\nIt's the trial mode, but\nyou put your product key in and\n\n217\n00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,945\nit becomes the full version.\n\n218\n00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,865\nVersion, so no big deal there, and\nyou can get up and running, and\n\n219\n00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,075\nyou're in business.\n\n220\n00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,935\nAll right, there's several\nother virtual machines in here,\n\n221\n00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,875\nif you look down the list,\nthat you can pick from.\n\n222\n00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,225\nIncluding things from Puppet Labs, if your\nwanna support like docker containers and\n\n223\n00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,335\nall that stuff.\n\n224\n00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:31,865\nThey're in here, in your own\npersonal images if you've made them.\n\n225\n00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,985\nAll right, but\nI'm gonna choose SharePoint, and\n\n226\n00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,100\nI'll hit the little next arrow.\n\n227\n00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,560\nThen it's gonna ask for a name.\n\n228\n00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,620\nI'll call this itprotv-sp01,\nthis is gonna be my SharePoint server.\n\n229\n00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,660\nYou might have noticed that little\nred exclamation point that appeared.\n\n230\n00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,490\nThese names have to be unique.\n\n231\n00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,970\nAnd so it's checking to see\nif they're already in use.\n\n232\n00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,440\nAnd so that's why it was complaining.\n\n233\n00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040\nAlso if you have any special characters or\n\n234\n00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720\nanything crazy in here it'll it'll\nget mad and warn you about that.\n\n235\n00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520\nSo, You might see that pop up.\n\n236\n00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,110\nThen we can pick the tier for it.\n\n237\n00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,060\nIs it going to be a basic\nlow resource server, or\n\n238\n00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,390\nis going to be a standard server\nwith more resources for SharePoint?\n\n239\n00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,050\nAnd we need a standard server.\n\n240\n00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,730\nNotice it defaults into four cores,\n28 gigs of ram, right?\n\n241\n00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,390\nMicrosoft knows how much resources\nwe're going to need to run SharePoint.\n\n242\n00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,210\nSharePoint is It loves RAM.\n\n243\n00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,960\n>> It's a hog.\n\n244\n00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,740\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,530\n>> It's not friendly on the hardware.\n\n246\n00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,200\nSo we can specify that, and then I'll put\nin my user account that we're gonna make.\n\n247\n00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160\nJust do dpezet again, because I can.\n\n248\n00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,780\nAll right, so we'll get that filled in and\nit doesn't need too much more information.\n\n249\n00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,190\nThe next thing it's gonna do is it's going\nto ask is if this is going to be part of\n\n250\n00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,980\na cloud service.\n\n251\n00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,560\nOne of the cool things about Azure,\n\n252\n00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,570\nis that we can group our virtual\nmachines together into services.\n\n253\n00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,580\nSo if I have a SharePoint front\nend running on one server, and\n\n254\n00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,790\nthe database running on another server.\n\n255\n00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,820\nBoth those servers have to be operational\nfor Share Point to be working.\n\n256\n00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,580\nSo I can group them together\ninto a cloud service.\n\n257\n00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,200\nIt's going to create a new\ncloud service for me.\n\n258\n00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,100\nBut I could choose other ones\nthat have already been made, and\n\n259\n00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,550\nyou see my web servers there.\n\n260\n00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,635\nAnd they'll be grouped together.\n\n261\n00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:09,855\nThey're still separate VMs, but\nthey're treated as being united.\n\n262\n00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,025\nIf there's ever failover to fail\nit over to another data center.\n\n263\n00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:18,025\nIt'll send them both to the same data\ncenter, because they depend on each other.\n\n264\n00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:20,125\nI'll create a new one though.\n\n265\n00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,115\nAnd then down here we've\ngot our cloud service's\n\n266\n00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:28,220\nDNS name which itprotv-sp01.cloudapp.net\nis what it's kinda defaulted to.\n\n267\n00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,930\nJumping over to West US though,\nlet me switch that to East US.\n\n268\n00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,360\nWe can specify storage for it.\n\n269\n00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,340\nWe'll just let it do\nit's own automated one.\n\n270\n00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,840\nThis is another area, Daniel have\nyou ever had to spec storage out for\n\n271\n00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,770\nlike a database server or SharePoint?\n\n272\n00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,340\n>> I can't say that I have.\n\n273\n00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,850\n>> It's fun.\n\n274\n00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,980\nWhen you build something up for\na database, for example, let's say SQL.\n\n275\n00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,824\nYou want to have two hard drives\nmirrored for the operating system.\n\n276\n00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:56,003\nYou wanna have another two hard\ndrives mirrored for the page file.\n\n277\n00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:59,663\nYou wanna have another set of hard drives,\neither RAID 5 or mirrored for\n\n278\n00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:01,540\nyour transaction logs.\n\n279\n00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,130\nAnd then you need a RAID 10 array for\nthe database files.\n\n280\n00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,270\nAnd if you've got more than one database,\n\n281\n00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,970\nyou want to have those spread\nacross more than one RAID 10 array.\n\n282\n00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,600\nBecause you're trying to\noptimize disk input, output.\n\n283\n00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,113\n>> It's a very simple set up though.\n\n284\n00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:13,706\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah, it's a breeze.\n\n285\n00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:17,900\nIt requires a good understanding of\nhow SQL works, how it accesses data,\n\n286\n00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,430\nhow to arrange stuff.\n\n287\n00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,610\nHow RAID arrays work, and which ones\nare optimal for reads versus writes,\n\n288\n00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,290\nit's a lot of work.\n\n289\n00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,290\nOr you just automatically\ngenerate a storage account,\n\n290\n00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,020\nMicrosoft does it for you.\n\n291\n00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,560\nDone.\n\n292\n00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,500\nRight?\nLike you can't\n\n293\n00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,930\nconfigure it wrong here, it won't let you.\n\n294\n00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,480\nSo.\n\n295\n00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,390\n>> That sounds good.\n\n296\n00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,545\nI'll have that.\n\n297\n00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> I mean that really is the way\n\n298\n00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,590\nthat you need to go.\n\n299\n00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,930\nAnd we'll see in another episode\nwhere we do their hosted SQL,\n\n300\n00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,330\nthat's even better right?\n\n301\n00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,780\nBut if we wanted something\nlike that we can do it.\n\n302\n00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,990\nHere it's just gonna create\nit's own storage account and\n\n303\n00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,600\nSharePoint will be attached to that.\n\n304\n00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,890\nAvailability sets, if I want high\navailability I can have more than one\n\n305\n00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,870\nSharePoint server on the same availability\nset, maybe in different regions.\n\n306\n00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,580\nSo maybe one's in east US,\none's in west US.\n\n307\n00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,400\nAnd if one SharePoint server's down,\nthe other ones up.\n\n308\n00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600\nWe're still healthy and available, right?\n\n309\n00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,290\nYou can set that fail over.\n\n310\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,840\nSame thing with load balancing,\nwe'll talk about that in another episode.\n\n311\n00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,190\nBut I have my endpoints down here,\nwhat access do I want to allow?\n\n312\n00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,370\nAt a minimum you need to\nallow Remote Desktop.\n\n313\n00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,300\nSo that you can remote in to connect\nto and manage the server, right?\n\n314\n00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,250\nYou gotta get logged in somehow.\n\n315\n00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,270\nBut here you'll see it's\nenabling PowerShell also, so\n\n316\n00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,640\nif you're accessing it with PowerShell\nscripts, then you'll need that too.\n\n317\n00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,740\nSo you can define that right here.\n\n318\n00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,030\nWe'll just leave it like that.\n\n319\n00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,900\nThe public port,\nsee how this public port is set to auto?\n\n320\n00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,960\nThat means it's going to automatically\ngenerate a port number for me.\n\n321\n00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,205\nIt's not going to expose\n3389 to the internet.\n\n322\n00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,005\nOn the server it'll be 3389.\n\n323\n00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:42,855\nBut they do port address translation.\n\n324\n00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,415\nAnd so they're gonna translate\nthat into some other port.\n\n325\n00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,925\nAnd it'll show me on the next screen, or\n\n326\n00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:50,175\nI can manually type one in if I\nwant to know what it's gonna be.\n\n327\n00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,345\nSo you can punch that in.\n\n328\n00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,545\nAnd if we want to add any other end\npoints, this a SharePoint server, so\n\n329\n00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,345\nmaybe I want to allow HTTPS traffic to it.\n\n330\n00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:01,870\nSo I want to allow secure traffic,\nand maybe even unsecure.\n\n331\n00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,510\nI'm gonna go crazy,\nflaunt the security edicts.\n\n332\n00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,893\nAnd so we'll just throw that in there.\n\n333\n00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,590\nAll right.\n\n334\n00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,370\nLastly we have the option to\ninstall other extensions.\n\n335\n00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,310\nThis is going to be Windows Server\n2012 R2 with SharePoint 2013 on it,\n\n336\n00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,070\nand Microsoft SQL for the database.\n\n337\n00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,190\nSo it's going to have\nall that pre-configured.\n\n338\n00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,290\nBut we can also install other things.\n\n339\n00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,240\nThe VM Agent is installed by default.\n\n340\n00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,010\nYou really, really want that.\n\n341\n00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,020\nThat's what's gonna allow Azure to monitor\nwhether your server is functional or\n\n342\n00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,620\nif it's locked up.\n\n343\n00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,650\nIt's what's gonna allow it to\ndo graceful reboots and stuff.\n\n344\n00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,390\nSo that VM Agent,\nwe almost always want that.\n\n345\n00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,240\nEverything else here is optional though.\n\n346\n00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,130\nDo we want Puppet Enterprise?\n\n347\n00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,170\nDo we want Chef or Custom Scripting, for\n\n348\n00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,770\nrunning package management and\nother things?\n\n349\n00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,260\nDo we want security extensions?\n\n350\n00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,920\nDo we want Microsoft anti-malware,\nSymantec end point protection?\n\n351\n00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,090\nWe can choose to tack these on and\nit'll put that in the VM for us too.\n\n352\n00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,800\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\nhit the check mark to finish that up.\n\n353\n00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,500\nAnd now it's gonna spawn\nthat third server for me.\n\n354\n00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,670\nSo by doing the server gallery I\ngot a lot more control, didn't I?\n\n355\n00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,560\nA lot of additional stuff, but\n\n356\n00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,180\nthat deployment won't take any\nlonger than the other guys.\n\n357\n00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,650\nEven though it's building up\na full share point environment,\n\n358\n00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,190\nwhich is pretty awesome.\n\n359\n00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,430\n>> Yeah, that's extremely sweet,\n\n360\n00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,460\ncuz like we were talking about with that\nshare point, all the goes along with that.\n\n361\n00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,140\nOr if we were building one of these\ndatabases, really intensive on input and\n\n362\n00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,470\noutput that kind of stuff, being able\ndo it this way say, do that for me.\n\n363\n00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,140\nI'm sold.\n\n364\n00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,740\nI'm sold.\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n365\n00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,620\nonce the servers up,\nnow we need to work with it, right?\n\n366\n00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,090\nWe need to get connected to it.\n\n367\n00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,430\nAnd we'll start with that Windows\nserver I made first right.\n\n368\n00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,070\nI made itprotv-web01, this guy.\n\n369\n00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,270\nAnd with a Windows server, we're gonna\nuse remote desktop to connect to it.\n\n370\n00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,630\nSo if I click on that server, it's going\nto take me to that server dashboard.\n\n371\n00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,500\nWell, it's going to take me this\nthis kind of welcome screen, but\n\n372\n00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,370\nif I click on dashboard, there we go.\n\n373\n00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,400\nNow I'll see the system dashboard and\n\n374\n00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,220\nin here if we scroll down,\nyou'll find some information you need.\n\n375\n00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,710\nHere's the DNS name of the server.\n\n376\n00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,680\nAnd then as we look at its IP and so on,\n\n377\n00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,568\nwe can find other information but\nthe main thing I need is the DNS name.\n\n378\n00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,920\nIf I'm gonna remote\ndesktop into this server,\n\n379\n00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,630\nI need a host name to connect to\n[INAUDIBLE] highlight that is it.\n\n380\n00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,970\nWell what will get most of it.\n\n381\n00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,210\nWe'll settle for that.\n\n382\n00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,790\nSo I need that name to connect to.\n\n383\n00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,760\nI do have the IP address right beneath it,\nhere's the public virtual IP\n\n384\n00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,400\nthat I can try to connect to, so\nI can use that but I'll use the DNS name.\n\n385\n00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320\nThe other thing I need is what\nport it put remote desktop on.\n\n386\n00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,860\nBecause remember it's gonna\nautomatically generate one?\n\n387\n00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,080\nWell for that I need to scroll back\nup here and go to the Endpoints tab.\n\n388\n00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,200\nAnd under Endpoints,\nI can see where remote desktop ended up.\n\n389\n00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,840\nOn the inside it's 3389, but\non the outside it's 54082.\n\n390\n00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,570\nSo now I can fire up my\nremote desktop client.\n\n391\n00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,630\nI can punch in a server, and\nthis would be my itprotv-web01.\n\n392\n00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,915\nAnd for the PC name, I'm just going to\nput in that itprotv-web01.cloudapp.net.\n\n393\n00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,420\nAnd then I need to do colon\nfollowed by the port number,\n\n394\n00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,950\nwhich I have already forgotten,\nso it's 54082.\n\n395\n00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,560\nNow keep in mind when you create your\nserver, you probably won't get 54082.\n\n396\n00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,920\nYou probably get a different port\nnumber so you gotta look that up for\n\n397\n00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,880\nyour service right.\n\n398\n00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,020\nI can punch in my user credentials\nthat made an account for\n\n399\n00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,770\nme called d.pezet and\nI'll punch in the password for that.\n\n400\n00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,770\nNow I'm using the Microsoft\nremote desktop client for MAC.\n\n401\n00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,820\nBut it's the same thing in\nthe remote desktop plan or\n\n402\n00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,810\nterminal services plan in Windows or any\nof the ones that are available for Linux.\n\n403\n00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,290\nYou punch in your server name.\n\n404\n00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,990\nThe port number is\nthe most important part.\n\n405\n00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,700\nAll right.\n\n406\n00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,070\nOnce I've got that, though, it's in there.\n\n407\n00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,190\nI can double click on that, and\nnow I'm gonna remote into that server.\n\n408\n00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,520\nNow the first thing I get here is that I'm\nconnecting, it's got a certificate and\n\n409\n00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,710\nit doesn't trust it.\n\n410\n00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,430\nAnd the reason it doesn't trust it is,\nit's a self signed certificate, right?\n\n411\n00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,710\nWe don't we don't trust\nthe route that issued it.\n\n412\n00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,680\nBut you can come in here and\n\n413\n00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,460\nyou can look at the details of\nthe certificate and find that information.\n\n414\n00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,200\nMore importantly, you can look for look\nfor the fingerprint which is in here and\n\n415\n00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,120\nyou can take that and\ncompare it to what's on the website and\n\n416\n00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,727\nmake sure that that is\nthe proper certificates.\n\n417\n00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:14,380\nSo, all the fingerprints right\ndown here at the bottom and\n\n418\n00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,750\nyou go and compare that to what's\nlisted in the Azure panel.\n\n419\n00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,310\nThey're buried away under the dashboard,\nif I remember right.\n\n420\n00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,860\nAnd we can go in and compare those.\n\n421\n00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,793\nIt is right here\nRDP Certificate Thumbprint, and\n\n422\n00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,970\nI can look at this number and\nso it ends in 8AD5.\n\n423\n00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,960\nAnd I go back here and this is not\nthe most scientific way I can do this, but\n\n424\n00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,230\nI can look and see does this and\nan 8AD5 and sure enough it does.\n\n425\n00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,380\nRight but you probably want\nto verify the whole thing.\n\n426\n00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,000\nBut that tells me it's a good certificate.\n\n427\n00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,740\nWe can trust it, I'll hit always trust and\ncontinue and now it's asking.\n\n428\n00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,770\nI'm trusting it here on my workstation,\nso it's asking for my credentials.\n\n429\n00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,730\nSo that is just my machine doing it.\n\n430\n00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,620\nThere we go.\n\n431\n00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,000\nNow it's going to connect up and\nif I didn't wait too long, then here I am.\n\n432\n00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840\nI'm logging into a Windows\nserver 2012R2 machine and\n\n433\n00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,520\nthis was one that was gonna\nbe my web server right.\n\n434\n00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,440\nSo I log in, and here's the part\nI was telling you about Daniel,\n\n435\n00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,440\nonce you're in it's just a server, server\nlike any other I go in and I can add IIS,\n\n436\n00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,700\nI can add all the other\ndifferent things that I need.\n\n437\n00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,310\nFirst login always takes the longest\ncuz creating my profile, but\n\n438\n00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,630\nas soon as I'm in,\nI'm ready to work my goal.\n\n439\n00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,620\n>> So really the only difference between\nthis and using something like ESX or\n\n440\n00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,010\nCitrix ZEN server that kind of stuff\nis that, where it's actually residing.\n\n441\n00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,640\nThis is up in the cloud\non the Azure software\n\n442\n00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,300\n>> Where or\n\n443\n00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500\nhardware should I say\nwhereas before other way,\n\n444\n00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,150\nwe would have it here in our own\nbuilding whatever the case may be.\n\n445\n00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,690\n>> Yeah and you know here it goes,\nit's actually connecting now.\n\n446\n00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,720\nSo once it's up, I don't know what\nactual hardware CPUs it has or\n\n447\n00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,810\nphysical hard drive construction that it's\ngot or whatever that's all hidden from me.\n\n448\n00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,600\nRight?\nThat's all\n\n449\n00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000\nAzure taking care of that stuff and\nmapping it out.\n\n450\n00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,510\nIf I go, like, so\nhere I am in my server manager.\n\n451\n00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,107\nIf I go into computer management,\n\n452\n00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:07,770\nwhich I guess I could have added\nsome extra memory to this one.\n\n453\n00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,710\nSo if I go into computer management,\nthough, we can start to look\n\n454\n00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,530\nat the hardware as our system sees it, and\nit's going to see all virtual hardware.\n\n455\n00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,180\nThis running on top of Hyper-V.\n\n456\n00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,780\nRight?\nSo\n\n457\n00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,860\nit's going to see virtualized\nhardware in a lot of places.\n\n458\n00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,620\nIf I go down here into storage and Disk\nManagement, what I'm seeing are not real,\n\n459\n00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,710\nphysical hard drives,\nthese are virtual hard drives.\n\n460\n00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,130\nThis is disk zero is a virtual hard\ndrive that's created by Azure.\n\n461\n00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,960\nMy system just sees it as a drive,\nit doesn't know anything about it.\n\n462\n00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,420\nAnd dig into its properties and\ngo into like details or whatever.\n\n463\n00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,820\nThe description there, disk drive, right?\n\n464\n00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,820\nIt's not saying it's a Seagate whatever or\nanything.\n\n465\n00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,520\nThere's very very little\ninformation in there about it.\n\n466\n00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,090\nAnd if I go into my device manager, here I\ncan start to see a little bit more, right?\n\n467\n00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,270\nLike my processors,\nI can see I'm on a Xeon E5-2660.\n\n468\n00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,470\nSo there's my actual CPU on the underlying\nhardware at the Azure data center,\n\n469\n00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,880\nbut we start looking at things\nlike our network adapters.\n\n470\n00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,540\nThat's a paravirtualized network adapter,\nright?\n\n471\n00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,990\nMicrosoft Hyper-V network\nadapter right there.\n\n472\n00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,780\nOr it's a synthetic network adapter,\nnot paravirtualized.\n\n473\n00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,630\nSo, anyhow, we see each of those\ndifferent things on HMS plus.\n\n474\n00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,960\nWe treat like a regular server.\n\n475\n00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,180\nSo if I want it to run IIS, well,\nI go into my Add Remove server roles,\n\n476\n00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,920\nand we add the web server role,\nand we're ready to rock.\n\n477\n00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,440\nSo we won't dally with that\ntoo much here in this episode.\n\n478\n00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,880\nBut that's basically it on\nthe on the Microsoft side.\n\n479\n00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,330\nSo not a big challenge there.\n\n480\n00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:33,920\nWe're up, we're running.\n\n481\n00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,260\nYou know when you create your\nother servers as you need them.\n\n482\n00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,170\nSame thing with them right?\n\n483\n00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,380\nThey get different RDP ports, you could\nsend them all the same if you want them.\n\n484\n00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,850\nAnd then you remote in and you manage it.\n\n485\n00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,480\n>> So it sounds like all I got to do\nis start learning the Azure UI so\n\n486\n00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,650\nI get in there,\nget neck deep into that guy and\n\n487\n00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,220\nsay okay, well let's see here I\ngot to this that and the other.\n\n488\n00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,890\nI do like that they do make things\na little bit easier with saying,\n\n489\n00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,080\nthis is a virtual machine.\n\n490\n00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,160\nIt's on an instance like they do an AWS.\n\n491\n00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,590\nSo, I like that since I've\ndone a lot of Microsoft,\n\n492\n00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,020\nthat would be where I'd probably go.\n\n493\n00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,240\n>> Yeah.\nNow, for\n\n494\n00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,940\na Linux box it's a little bit different.\n\n495\n00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,060\nOn the Linux side,\nwe don't have a remote desktop.\n\n496\n00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,910\nWe have SSH, right?\n\n497\n00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,140\nSo you're gonna do a secure\nshell connection to the system.\n\n498\n00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,490\nIt created a user account for us to be\nable to use to connect to the system, and\n\n499\n00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,700\nit gave us a password.\n\n500\n00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,750\nSo we can fire up any old SSH client and\ndo it.\n\n501\n00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,515\nLet me show you guys with itprotv-web02.\n\n502\n00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:26,405\nRight?\nSo, if we go to our virtual machine list,\n\n503\n00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,843\nand we go to that server,\nso itprotv-web02.\n\n504\n00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:32,315\nAnd I'll go to its dashboard,\nthis is that Linux box.\n\n505\n00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:36,557\nAnd as I scroll down over here,\ninstead of seeing information,\n\n506\n00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:38,887\nwell I mean you do see DNS name,\nwhich is important.\n\n507\n00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:41,357\nBut instead of seeing\nlike RDP certificate,\n\n508\n00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:44,957\nwhat I'll see down here is\nthe SSH details, right?\n\n509\n00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,647\nHere is the host that I need to SSH into.\n\n510\n00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:51,417\nIt's on port 22, which is the default for\nSSH, it doesn't change that.\n\n511\n00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:55,757\nAnd then the SSH certificate thumbprint,\nwould be listed right there.\n\n512\n00:23:55,757 --> 00:24:01,297\nNow mine is not listed,\nwhich means I may have not enabled it.\n\n513\n00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,180\nWell, it may not have generated it yet.\n\n514\n00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,880\nSo, let's test that out and\nsee where we end up there.\n\n515\n00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,730\nBut we can SSH into that guy,\nand it created a default user for\n\n516\n00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,410\nme, it was called azureuser,\nand I'm gonna connect to it.\n\n517\n00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,150\nOh, you know what?\n\n518\n00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,590\nI got this out of order, so\nlet me fix my command here.\n\n519\n00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,080\nSo I'm just gonna do SSH,\nand point at this.\n\n520\n00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,770\nNow, I'm on a Mac,\non a Linux box it would be the same thing,\n\n521\n00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,550\nyou would drop to a terminal, and do this.\n\n522\n00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,380\nIf you're on a Windows box,\nWindows does not include a SSH client, so\n\n523\n00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,490\nyou'd need to download one like PuTTY,\nis one that I use a lot.\n\n524\n00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,250\nThere's others that are out there, and\n\n525\n00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,350\nyou would just punch in that server name,\nand connect to it.\n\n526\n00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,770\nSo here, I'm reaching out to it.\n\n527\n00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:46,900\nI'm getting the RSA key, this is\nthe certificate fingerprint for SSH.\n\n528\n00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,190\nAnd I need to compare that against\nthe fingerprint here, which is not listed.\n\n529\n00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,090\nSo, I'm gonna refresh the screen and\nsee if it gets added for me here.\n\n530\n00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,700\nWhat you're doing is verifying that you\nare actually connecting to the server that\n\n531\n00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,550\nyou think you are, and\nnot connecting to somebody else's server.\n\n532\n00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,165\nYou might be throwing\ncredentials at the wrong server.\n\n533\n00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,448\nSo it will show up in there, eventually.\n\n534\n00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:12,329\nJust not right now.\n\n535\n00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,182\nFor some reason [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n536\n00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:14,465\n>> That one is not showing up.\n\n537\n00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,748\nWell, I'm gonna trust it cuz I\nbuilt the server up just now, so\n\n538\n00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,345\nwe'll go ahead and connect.\n\n539\n00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:18,865\nAnd there we go.\n\n540\n00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:21,535\nSo it just let me know that it's\nadded that to my known hosts,\n\n541\n00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:26,900\nand it's asking for my password for\nthe server, and I'll get in there.\n\n542\n00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,880\nIf I type my password right, that is.\n\n543\n00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,790\nAnd once that's done, it'll log me in,\nand I'll see my Linux prompt, and\n\n544\n00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,380\nI'll be able to work with the system.\n\n545\n00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,240\nThere we go.\n\n546\n00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,835\nSo now,\nI can see that I'm in itprotv-web02, and\n\n547\n00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,597\nit gave me a nice little welcome screen\nhere to let me know I was in this system.\n\n548\n00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:47,401\nAnd I can see welcome to Ubuntu\n4.04.2 LTS, blah, blah, blah.\n\n549\n00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:50,974\nSo I'm in this system, and\nif I do a little uname -a, or whatever,\n\n550\n00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:53,335\nI can see I'm on a Linux box.\n\n551\n00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,120\nNow, I'm working on that server.\n\n552\n00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,940\nI install whatever it is I need\nto install, and off we go.\n\n553\n00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,490\nSo I do, actually you know\nthis better than me, Daniel.\n\n554\n00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,804\nWhat is it, apt-get-\n>> apt-get- install, and\n\n555\n00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,300\nwhatever your package name is.\n\n556\n00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,340\n>> Let's do, do they call it apache, or\ndo they call it, it looks like an ED or-\n\n557\n00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,530\n>> Yeah it's, there you go.\n\n558\n00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,410\n>> There we go.\n\n559\n00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,380\nIt has no install candidate, great.\n\n560\n00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:17,880\nWell.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n561\n00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,946\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, I see it's meshed\n\n562\n00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,158\nall these other things.\nOh,\n\n563\n00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:22,125\nthey called it apache2, lame.\nSo\n\n564\n00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:22,683\nanyhow.\n[LAUGH]\n\n565\n00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:23,183\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n566\n00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:24,010\n>> There we go.\n\n567\n00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,891\nSo, we can go and\nstart installing the software, and pow,\n\n568\n00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:26,690\nnow I'm on a web server.\n\n569\n00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,790\nSo we get these servers up and running,\njust like they're here in house with us,\n\n570\n00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,202\nbut now they're out there in the cloud.\n\n571\n00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:36,010\nI'm not gonna bother connecting to\nthe SharePoint one, but it's the same one.\n\n572\n00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,940\nYou remote desktop into it, and\n\n573\n00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,750\nyou'll need to fire up the SharePoint\nconfiguration just to be able to go in and\n\n574\n00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,120\nname things, set your domain name,\nand all that.\n\n575\n00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240\nBut as far as getting servers up and\nrunning, that's it right there.\n\n576\n00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,000\nIt's as easy as a couple of clicks,\nand you're in business.\n\n577\n00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,060\n>> Yeah, they did a really good job\nof making this pretty user-friendly,\n\n578\n00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,270\nvery intuitive interface\n>> I liked it a lot.\n\n579\n00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,370\nHopefully, all you guys out\nthere watching do as well.\n\n580\n00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,430\nSo Don, I think we've covered\nhow to actually create\n\n581\n00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,210\na virtual server using Azure.\n\n582\n00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,550\nHave we missed anything?\n\n583\n00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,020\n>> We haven't missed anything, but we have\nbarely scraped the tip of the iceberg.\n\n584\n00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,360\nThere's a lot more we can do with\nthis stuff, so stay tuned for\n\n585\n00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,900\nour other episodes as we move\ninto the advanced features.\n\n586\n00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,070\nBut as far as getting a server up and\nrunning, that covers it.\n\n587\n00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,330\n>> Yeah, it should be good to go.\n\n588\n00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,540\nThat being said, I guess we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n589\n00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,060\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n590\n00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,630\nThat being said,\nit is time to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n591\n00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,750\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n592\n00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,460\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n593\n00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,688\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n594\n00:27:26,688 -->

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,340\nI'll be your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,150\nHere with me, well is Don Pezet,\nmy mentor, my master.\n\n6\n00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,760\nHelp me out with this\nday we're having today.\n\n7\n00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,400\nHow you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,260\n>> I am doing great,\nexcited to be on the show again.\n\n9\n00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080\nAnd what we're gonna be doing today,\nis taking a look at some\n\n10\n00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,010\nof the advanced options we can\nconfigure when we create a VM in Azure.\n\n11\n00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,880\nNow on a previous episode, we showed\nyou guys how to create servers, right?\n\n12\n00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,590\nYou whip up VMs dynamically, and\nall that, and it was kinda neat.\n\n13\n00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,810\nSet some basic options,\nremote it into them and so on.\n\n14\n00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,680\nBut once the server's up,\nfor the most part,\n\n15\n00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,670\nyou just manage it like\na normal server right?\n\n16\n00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,630\nAnd off you go and that's it.\n\n17\n00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,960\nBut, there's a few advanced\nfeatures inside of Azure,\n\n18\n00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,600\nthat center around\nredundancy in availability,\n\n19\n00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,050\nthat we can really take advantage of,\nto make our environment even better.\n\n20\n00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,310\nOne of the coolest things about using\na service like the Azure cloud,\n\n21\n00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,330\nis that Microsoft has state of the art,\nmultibillion.\n\n22\n00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,233\nWell, maybe not billion.\n\n23\n00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,469\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Definitely multimillion dollar\n\n24\n00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,630\ndata centers,\nthat you're piggy backing off of, right?\n\n25\n00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,500\nSo your company might not have the budget\nto build out these massive data centers on\n\n26\n00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,160\nevery continent on the planet,\n\n27\n00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,790\nand multiple ones in\ndifferent geographic regions.\n\n28\n00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,910\nBut Microsoft does, and we can take\nadvantage of that, and we can use it, and\n\n29\n00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,230\nit really does serve us a lot of benefit.\n\n30\n00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,860\nEspecially if you're small or\nmedium business, but\n\n31\n00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,810\neven an enterprise can really\ntake advantage of this.\n\n32\n00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,920\nThing is, you don't get the full\nbenefit of it by default.\n\n33\n00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,490\nWhen you whip up a server,\nthat server exists in one data center,\n\n34\n00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,850\nrunning on one piece of hardware.\n\n35\n00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,050\nAnd if that hardware fails,\n\n36\n00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,590\nsure you can restart on another\npiece of hardware, great.\n\n37\n00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,140\nBut could fail,\nyour system could go offline,\n\n38\n00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,420\nand then you got an outage\nyou have to deal with.\n\n39\n00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,060\nWell Microsoft has the tools for\n\n40\n00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,410\nus to get around that,\nwe just have to take advantage of it.\n\n41\n00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,260\n>> Awesome, so where do we find these\ntools, and how can we use them?\n\n42\n00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,840\nThat's obviously the first question.\n\n43\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,550\n>> Well some of them, we actually saw,\nwhen we were creating and\n\n44\n00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,316\ndeploying a server, and\nwe just kinda ignored them.\n\n45\n00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:02,914\n[LAUGH] The two.\n\n46\n00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The two that I really want to\n\n47\n00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,440\ntalk about.\n\n48\n00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,830\nWe've got a few neat things.\n\n49\n00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:16,700\nSo inside of Azure, we can create\nwhat are called availability sets.\n\n50\n00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,820\nAnd we can create load balancing sets.\n\n51\n00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,100\nNow let's start with\nthe availability ones.\n\n52\n00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,130\nWhen you bring up a virtual machine,\n\n53\n00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,888\nit's actually running on a piece\nof hardware in a data somewhere.\n\n54\n00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:31,420\nSo whatever region you chose, you know,\nthat data center is where your\n\n55\n00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,020\nVM's running, It's running on a physical\nserver in a rack at their location.\n\n56\n00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,430\nThere might be other customers\nrunning in that same physical server.\n\n57\n00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,190\nBut you are running on one server.\n\n58\n00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,490\nWell, that one servers running hyper-v.\n\n59\n00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,730\nThat means it's running Windows.\n\n60\n00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,455\nAnd that And that means, at a minimum\nit gets updates at least once a month.\n\n61\n00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,145\nAnd it needs to reboot.\n\n62\n00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,615\nRight?\nWhat happens when it reboots?\n\n63\n00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,395\nDoes your server go offline?\n\n64\n00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:54,495\nActually it doesn't.\n\n65\n00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:58,605\nAnd that's because Microsoft plans for\nthat, with the use of availability sets.\n\n66\n00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,895\nAlso, what happens if that hardware fails?\n\n67\n00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,425\nWell, normally if the hardware fails,\n\n68\n00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:06,470\nMicrosoft would jump your storage over\nto another system and bring it back up.\n\n69\n00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,650\nBut you have an outage.\n\n70\n00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,010\nWhen that first server failed,\nyou lost what was in ram, and\n\n71\n00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,030\nyour server spun back up.\n\n72\n00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,230\nSo your outage ends up being however\nlong it takes your server to reboot,\n\n73\n00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,420\nmaybe a minute, maybe two minutes,\nwhatever, to come back up and running.\n\n74\n00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,100\nBut you did have an outage.\n\n75\n00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,640\nNow Microsoft took care of it.\n\n76\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,380\nThey fixed the hardware outage,\nthey switched you over to another machine.\n\n77\n00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,480\nYou don't worry about that,\nbut you had an outage.\n\n78\n00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,760\nSo we can plan for that.\n\n79\n00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,340\nWe can take advantage of that\nunderlying infrastructure,\n\n80\n00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,300\nand really get true stability and\navailability, all right?\n\n81\n00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,290\nNow, to better understand that,\nlet me show you an article that Microsoft\n\n82\n00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,760\npushed out, that is called, manage\nthe availability of virtual machines.\n\n83\n00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,000\nAnd the reason I like this article is,\n\n84\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,360\nthey show a little bit of what\nMicrosoft does behind the scenes, okay?\n\n85\n00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,740\nBehind the scenes, on the servers running\nat the Microsoft Azure data centers.\n\n86\n00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,700\nThey divide their servers up into\nwhat are called fault domains and\n\n87\n00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,910\nupdate domains, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,380\nFault domains are physical servers\ndivided up, in a way that if there\n\n89\n00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,690\nis a failure, only VMs running in that\nparticular fault domain, are affected.\n\n90\n00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,390\nAll right?\n\n91\n00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,250\nFault domains center around power and\nnetwork, all right?.\n\n92\n00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,400\nNow, a fault domain like\nfault domain zero here,\n\n93\n00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,230\nis usually comprised of one or\nmore physical servers.\n\n94\n00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,780\nSo these are all physical\nservers right here.\n\n95\n00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,380\nOkay?\n\n96\n00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,480\nSo fault domain zero,\nhas four servers in it right now.\n\n97\n00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,860\nThese four physical servers.\n\n98\n00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,710\nThese four servers share the same power\nsource, and they share the same network.\n\n99\n00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,640\nIf the network fails, or the power fails,\nall four of these guys go down.\n\n100\n00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,590\nSo when we deploy a VM,\nour VM is entirely in one fault domain.\n\n101\n00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,880\nWouldn't it be nice if our VM existed\nin more than one fault domain?\n\n102\n00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,150\nWell, every time you deploy a VM,\n\n103\n00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,900\nMicrosoft is spreading it across\nfive fault domains, all right?\n\n104\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,040\nSo if you create five VM's,\n\n105\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,560\nyou'll have one VM in each of\nfive different fault domains.\n\n106\n00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,730\nIf you create six VM's, the sixth one\ngoes in the very first fault domain.\n\n107\n00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,600\nSo now you have two VM's in\nthe first fault domain, and\n\n108\n00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,650\none in each of the remaining\nfault domains.\n\n109\n00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,160\nSo they're doing it on the backend.\n\n110\n00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,490\nMost people don't even know this happens.\n\n111\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,090\nIt's invisible, it's in the backend,\nand that's that.\n\n112\n00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,340\nBut Microsoft is spreading your\nservers across five fault domains.\n\n113\n00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,590\nAnd those five fault domains\nall have independent network,\n\n114\n00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,850\nall the way to the Internet.\n\n115\n00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,070\nAnd independent power all\nthe way to the power company.\n\n116\n00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,060\nSo these fault domains are almost like\nentire data centers, in and of themselves.\n\n117\n00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,760\nAnd I know in this diagram they\nshow like four servers in there.\n\n118\n00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,980\nBut the reality is there could be\nhundreds of servers in Fault Domain 0,\n\n119\n00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,740\nand Fault Domain 1 and Fault Domain 2.\n\n120\n00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,320\nAnd as you deploy VMs, it's just\nautomatically being spread across that.\n\n121\n00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,600\nSo solution number one to our problem.\n\n122\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,160\nIf hardware fails and\nI wanna avoid downtime, how do I fix that?\n\n123\n00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,450\nYou deploy more VMs.\n\n124\n00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,160\nRight?\n\n125\n00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,890\nIf I have a web server.\n\n126\n00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,480\nI should have two web servers.\n\n127\n00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,770\nIf I have two web servers,\nI know one will be in a fault domain, and\n\n128\n00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,120\nthe other will be in\na different fault domain.\n\n129\n00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,180\nNow they're in two different fault\ndomains, and so I know if one fails,\n\n130\n00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,750\nthe other's still up, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,740\nThe other thing is the update domain.\n\n132\n00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,650\nEach of these servers are running hyper-v.\n\n133\n00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,870\nUpdates come out at least once a month,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,160\nAnd when that happens,\na lot of the updates require a reboot.\n\n135\n00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,620\nSo if they have to reboot a server.\n\n136\n00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,540\nHow do you keep your VMs up?\n\n137\n00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,110\nWell when Microsoft goes to reboot\na server, they do a live migration.\n\n138\n00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,800\nThey move your VMs from\none server to another.\n\n139\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,980\nThey empty the server out, and\nthen they update it and reboot it.\n\n140\n00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,020\nThen they move the VMs back.\n\n141\n00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,250\nSo this happens all the time,\nand you don't even notice.\n\n142\n00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,630\nIt could be happening right now,\nand I wouldn't notice, right?\n\n143\n00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,730\nBut there is a little bit\nof a performance hit,\n\n144\n00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,740\nwhile live migrations are happening and\nthings of that nature.\n\n145\n00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,430\nSo what Microsoft does is,\n\n146\n00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,520\nthey divide your VMs inside of\na fault domain, into update domains.\n\n147\n00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,640\nNow your VMs will be spread across\njust to update domains, right?\n\n148\n00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,170\nAll the servers in here will be divided\nup, and when they push an update out,\n\n149\n00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,750\nthey'll reboot one update domain first.\n\n150\n00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,740\nAnd then they'll reboot the other update\ndomain, after the first one is done.\n\n151\n00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,330\nSo it's not like they'll ever have a\nchance where they reboot all their servers\n\n152\n00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,360\nat once, that would cause an outage.\n\n153\n00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,059\nSo this is a way that Microsoft\nprevents that outage from happening.\n\n154\n00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,550\nRight.\nNow all of what I've talked about,\n\n155\n00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,710\nis invisible behind the scenes,\nwe never see it.\n\n156\n00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,160\nBut if I have two web servers, and\n\n157\n00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,800\nI wanna make sure they're in different\nfault domains, how do I do that?\n\n158\n00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,470\nIf I have ten VMs, there's a chance that\n\n159\n00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,225\nboth of my web servers could be in\nthe same fault domain, isn't there?\n\n160\n00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:38,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n161\n00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,580\nSo if I want to ensure they're separated,\n\n162\n00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,630\nthat's where I need to create\nwhat's called an availability set.\n\n163\n00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,860\nAn availability set is\nan optional setting,\n\n164\n00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,730\nthat we can define when\nwe're creating a VM.\n\n165\n00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,040\nAnd we can set it after the fact, too.\n\n166\n00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,690\nIt's not like we're screwed\nif we forget to set it.\n\n167\n00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,361\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And you can't\n\n168\n00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:53,921\ngo back and do it.\n\n169\n00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,030\nWe can always change that later on.\n\n170\n00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,142\nSo if we want to see that in action.\n\n171\n00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:00,591\nIf I go back here to my Azure screen.\n\n172\n00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,976\nAnd I'll just whip up a new VM to\nshow you guys in the wizard, and\n\n173\n00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,590\nthen we'll modify these other\nones that I already have.\n\n174\n00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,060\nSo, I'm gonna create a third web server.\n\n175\n00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,310\nSo when I go to create this server,\nI'll do a Windows Server one.\n\n176\n00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,030\nWe'll do itprotv-web03.\n\n177\n00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,400\nWe'll just do a small server.\n\n178\n00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,450\nGive it a username and password.\n\n179\n00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,095\nSo we get that set up and\nI'll put this in east US.\n\n180\n00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:28,465\nBut that's another way to get\ngood availability, right.\n\n181\n00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,673\nSo stick these web servers\nin different regions.\n\n182\n00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:33,730\nIf I have one in east US and one in Japan.\n\n183\n00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,940\nWell the entire east US data center\ncould go down I still have that note\n\n184\n00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,640\nover in Japan.\n\n185\n00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,103\nThat's an easy way to do it.\n\n186\n00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,492\nAll right,\nI'll create that virtual machine.\n\n187\n00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:46,960\nNow when I created that, did it ask\nanything about an availability set?\n\n188\n00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,230\nNo, we don't see that and\nthat's because I did the quick create.\n\n189\n00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,940\nWith quick create it\njust assumes information.\n\n190\n00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,160\nIt makes those settings and\nit does them for us.\n\n191\n00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,180\nIf I go back to do a new VM, and\nthis time, I do, from Gallery, right?\n\n192\n00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,230\nAnd I pick it in here.\n\n193\n00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,140\nI'm just gonna do a Windows Server\n2012 R2 Data Center, right?\n\n194\n00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,200\nThe same basic thing that I\njust picked with Quick Create.\n\n195\n00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,100\nNow, I get the menu items, though.\n\n196\n00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,490\nAnd as we go through these menu items.\n\n197\n00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,370\nIt's not too much different, right?\n\n198\n00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,980\nWe'll do web 04, we'll create a username.\n\n199\n00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,160\nBut you'll see that we'll have an option\nin here to set that availability set.\n\n200\n00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,340\nSo it's kind of redundant.\n\n201\n00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,990\nBut so here it's, you know if I\nwanna do a new Cloud service, great,\n\n202\n00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,970\nCloud service DNS name.\n\n203\n00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,320\nMy region, I'll put this,\neast U.S., storage account.\n\n204\n00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,750\nAvailability set.\n\n205\n00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,430\nAnd see how the availability\nset is set to none?\n\n206\n00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,110\nAnd that just means Microsoft's going\nto handle this on the back-end.\n\n207\n00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,480\nMay not be the way you want it but\n\n208\n00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,060\nMicrosoft doesn't know how your\nservers interact, only you know that.\n\n209\n00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,540\nSo I'm gonna say, you know what?\n\n210\n00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,630\nLet's create an availability set.\n\n211\n00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,600\nI'm gonna make one called itprotv-web.\n\n212\n00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,820\nThis is gonna be my web farmer.\n\n213\n00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,330\nYou know what?\n\n214\n00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,210\nMaybe I'll call it web farm.\n\n215\n00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,610\nThere, all right.\n\n216\n00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,520\nAnd after that, it's now gonna put\nthis guy into an availability set.\n\n217\n00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,570\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and set that.\n\n218\n00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,880\nIt's gonna know it and\nthen I'll just complete the wizard.\n\n219\n00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,770\nNothing else really special, I'm not gonna\ninstall any crazy agents or anything.\n\n220\n00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,980\nAnd we'll deploy this guy.\n\n221\n00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,010\nThat just created an availability\nset called itprotv-web farm.\n\n222\n00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,560\nAnd if I take my other web servers and\nI put them in that same availability\n\n223\n00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,400\nset now the system will know, oh,\nthese guys, I need to keep them separate.\n\n224\n00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,920\nI need to separate them out\nacross default domains and\n\n225\n00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,440\nI need to divide them in half\nbetween the update domains, so\n\n226\n00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,580\nthat I never have an instance where\nall of them could go offline.\n\n227\n00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,280\nThat's how Microsoft knows how to\nseparate it, otherwise they don't,\n\n228\n00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,970\notherwise it's a crap shoot, right?\n\n229\n00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,120\nYou're just hoping that Microsoft\nplaces them on diverse servers and\n\n230\n00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,310\nthere's no guarantee, right?\n\n231\n00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,330\nSo I did that for web 04.\n\n232\n00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,320\nI need to go back and fix my other guys.\n\n233\n00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,692\nSo I'll go to itprotv-web01 and\nI'll go to configure and\n\n234\n00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,754\nin here we start to see the settings.\n\n235\n00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:01,800\nAnd right here is availability set.\n\n236\n00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,500\nAnd if I hadn't created one,\nI could actually create one right now and\n\n237\n00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,400\nI could put it into its\nown availability set.\n\n238\n00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,550\nOr as I start to create new servers,\n\n239\n00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,350\nI could put them into the availability\nset that I made a moment ago.\n\n240\n00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,130\nNow the new availability set\nI made is not showing up yet\n\n241\n00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,325\nwhich means I'm going too fast.\n\n242\n00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:22,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On the show sometimes we make rapid\n\n243\n00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,160\nchanges we don't give the system time.\n\n244\n00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,490\nThe other server must not\nbe done provisioning yet so\n\n245\n00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,380\nlet me leave this page and\nwe'll go, oh yeah.\n\n246\n00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,360\nITProTV Web04 is still provisioning.\n\n247\n00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,560\nI have to wait for\nit to finish provisioning for\n\n248\n00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,400\nit to create the availability set.\n\n249\n00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,880\nAnd once that happens, I'll then see it in\nthe drop down box with the other guys and\n\n250\n00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,260\nbe able to specify that.\n\n251\n00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,570\nBut I'll need to move, if all these four\nweb servers are linked together, right?\n\n252\n00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,850\nIf they're all a common web server\nthen I'll need to move them into that\n\n253\n00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,410\navailability set to get it put in\nplace and make sure they're spread\n\n254\n00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,920\nacross those fault domains and\nupdate domains.\n\n255\n00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,830\nMicrosoft won't know what to do unless I\nput them in the same availability set.\n\n256\n00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,600\nAnd they'll try.\n\n257\n00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,240\nThey do a great job on the back-end\nof protecting that but\n\n258\n00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,600\nyou know your data better than they do.\n\n259\n00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,500\nIt's your data, and so you know which\nservers are linked together, and\n\n260\n00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,590\nthose servers should be put\nin an availability set.\n\n261\n00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,120\n>> That's awesome.\n\n262\n00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,010\nNow, I'm thinking of this\nin terms of the updates.\n\n263\n00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,880\nLike, Don, you were talking about earlier\nthat when those updates come out,\n\n264\n00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,230\na lot of times, especially on Patch\nTuesday, you have to reboot the system.\n\n265\n00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,770\nAnd therefore,\n\n266\n00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,030\nin work environments that I've worked in,\nyou have to send out an email,\n\n267\n00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,210\nlet everybody know that that will not be\navailable from this time to that time.\n\n268\n00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,360\nWhen we work with these availability sets,\nit kind of removes that,\n\n269\n00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,290\nbecause I can set up two servers.\n\n270\n00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,220\nOne's gonna take over,\nwhile the other one's down and\n\n271\n00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,780\nrebooting, getting its updates.\n\n272\n00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,150\nAnd then, when it comes back up, I can do\nthe other one, and no one's the wiser.\n\n273\n00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,040\nWell, let's build on that.\n\n274\n00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,450\nBecause the availability sets,\nthose are Microsoft servers.\n\n275\n00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,170\nThe underlying hyper V servers.\n\n276\n00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,490\nNot your servers.\n\n277\n00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,230\nSo, you still have your problem.\n\n278\n00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,140\nEverything you said is exactly right\nas far as what you have to do with\n\n279\n00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,040\nyour servers.\n\n280\n00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,294\nSo I just put these guys,\nwhere did my screen go?\n\n281\n00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:05,080\nThere.\n\n282\n00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,900\nIf I have these four servers all on\nthe same availability set when Microsoft\n\n283\n00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,520\ndoes their updates but the actual\nhardware in the data center I'm now safe.\n\n284\n00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,835\nBut what about me and my updates?\n\n285\n00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,240\nRight, what you were talking about,\nDaniel.\n\n286\n00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,050\nWhat if I need to update,\nI'd have to go to webtv 01.\n\n287\n00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,630\nIt's Tuesday,\ntime to push them updates to web 01.\n\n288\n00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,160\nOr Web 02 or Web 03.\n\n289\n00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,360\nWell, in that scenario, I need to combine\navailability sets with a low down set.\n\n290\n00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,740\nNow, it's a rare day that you\ndon't use these two together.\n\n291\n00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,820\nSo that's why we put it\nhere in the same episode.\n\n292\n00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,960\nWhen you deploy availability sets,\nyou typically deploy load balancing sets\n\n293\n00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,110\nwith them too,\nto load balance between these systems.\n\n294\n00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,920\nWhat the load balancer does is it takes\ntraffic that's destined for your servers.\n\n295\n00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,660\nAnd well, it balances it,\n\n296\n00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,100\nevenly distributes it across the servers\nthat are in your environment.\n\n297\n00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,630\nSo it doesn't send all the traffic to one.\n\n298\n00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,150\nAnd Microsoft does a good little\narticle on this one also,\n\n299\n00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,370\nwith a nice little diagram\nthat kind of shows it.\n\n300\n00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,910\nNormally your client does a DNS lookup.\n\n301\n00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,140\nThe DNS entry points to a single server.\n\n302\n00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,890\nThey connect to the single server,\nand that's the end of it.\n\n303\n00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,450\nBut if that single server fails, the DNS\nentry's pointing at a bad server now.\n\n304\n00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,880\nPeople can't get at your service,\neven though you might have other servers.\n\n305\n00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,596\nSo with load balancing, your DNS\nrecord points at the load balancer.\n\n306\n00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,716\nAnd then the load balancer\nsends some traffic to this VM,\n\n307\n00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,910\nother traffic to this VM,\nother traffic to this third VM.\n\n308\n00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,330\nAnd it monitors those virtual\nmachines to make sure they're on.\n\n309\n00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,040\nSo if I do updates to this VM and\n\n310\n00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,200\nI reboot it, the load balancer\nwill stop sending it traffic.\n\n311\n00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,390\nAnd it'll spread the traffic over\nthe other remaining VMs that are in place.\n\n312\n00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,950\nOkay?\n\n313\n00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,700\nAnd that's useful for\nour updates or our faults, right?\n\n314\n00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,005\nMaybe it's a web server, and\nI crash IIS on this system.\n\n315\n00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,840\nOr I stop the IIS service just for\nthe heck of it, right?\n\n316\n00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,960\nWell, the load balancer will\nsee the web service is down and\n\n317\n00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,270\njust send traffic to the other guys,\nright?\n\n318\n00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,750\nSo the availability set,\n\n319\n00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,630\nthat protects us on Microsoft's side,\non the physical servers.\n\n320\n00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,580\nThe load balancers protect us on\nthe virtual side, on our servers.\n\n321\n00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,040\nAnd so you normally use those\ntwo together as a tactic.\n\n322\n00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,720\nVery cool.\n\n323\n00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,840\n>> So, yeah.\n\n324\n00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,600\nSo it's kind of an important thing.\n\n325\n00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,500\nIf we wanna see this, configuring load\nbalancer is actually pretty easy.\n\n326\n00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,410\nIt's done through our\nendpoints on a server.\n\n327\n00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,920\nSo let me go back to my\nvirtual machines here.\n\n328\n00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,200\nAnd let's say that I wanna load\nbalance between web 01 and web 02.\n\n329\n00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,290\nIf I go to web 01, and I go to Endpoints.\n\n330\n00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,620\nRight here,\nI can see the endpoints that I have.\n\n331\n00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,900\nAnd I've got Power Shell and\nRemote Desktop.\n\n332\n00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,490\nIt's a web server, right?\n\n333\n00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,940\nSo I need to add HTTP as\nan endpoint into this system.\n\n334\n00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,669\nSo down here at the bottom,\nI'm gonna go to Add.\n\n335\n00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,430\nAnd when I add an endpoint I can pick,\nis this a stand alone endpoint?\n\n336\n00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,050\nPeople just coming to this server, or\n\n337\n00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,880\ndo I wanna add an endpoint to\nan existing load balance set.\n\n338\n00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,801\nAnd this is where I can attach\nit to a load balance set, right?\n\n339\n00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,780\nTo get it tied on there and\nload balanced and in place.\n\n340\n00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,461\nNow, I don't actually have\na load balance set yet.\n\n341\n00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,790\nRight?\nSo I can add a standalone endpoint.\n\n342\n00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,980\nAnd when you do that, you can provide it.\n\n343\n00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,340\nAnd I'll say this is gonna be HTTP.\n\n344\n00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,750\nTCP port 80.\n\n345\n00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,760\nThat's great.\n\n346\n00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,580\nAnd then right here.\n\n347\n00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,730\nCreate a load balance set.\n\n348\n00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,410\nI'm gonna check that off.\n\n349\n00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,810\nSo I'm gonna create this load balancer.\n\n350\n00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,760\nAnd then right here,\nI've got enable direct server return.\n\n351\n00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,890\nThat helps tie people to\nan individual server.\n\n352\n00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,650\nYou can use SQL to do that.\n\n353\n00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,690\nIt's a little beyond the scope\nof what we're gonna do here, so\n\n354\n00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,190\nI'm gonna leave that off right now.\n\n355\n00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,130\nSome applications are really\nsensitive though.\n\n356\n00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,170\nNot sensitive isn't like emotional, but\nsensitive as in if your client connects to\n\n357\n00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,100\nserver one first and\nthen they get jumped over to server three.\n\n358\n00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,620\nIt might break their session and so we can\ndo a direct server returns to make sure\n\n359\n00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,800\npeople get right back to\nthe correct server and\n\n360\n00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,910\nnot go through the load balancer.\n\n361\n00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,380\nThat keeps the session in one place.\n\n362\n00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,790\nIt's not something we\ntypically have to do.\n\n363\n00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,100\nAll right, so\nI'm going to ahead and set that and\n\n364\n00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,500\nI'll just hit next and now it's gonna\nask me about the load balance set.\n\n365\n00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,950\nAnd so I'll call this my ITProTV-webfarm.\n\n366\n00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,440\nIt's TCP port 80 and now I set my probes.\n\n367\n00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,190\nThe probes define how I know whether\nthe nodes are healthy or not.\n\n368\n00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:19,100\nThe default is every 15 seconds it's\ngonna probe the other system and\n\n369\n00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,690\nif it fails twice then it'll determine\nthe other node has failed and\n\n370\n00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,550\nit'll stop sending traffic to it, right?\n\n371\n00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,330\nWell if I'm probing every 15 seconds and\nit takes two failures,\n\n372\n00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,880\nthat means it'll take 30\nseconds to find a failure.\n\n373\n00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,570\nIs that okay with you?\n\n374\n00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,040\nIf it's okay, than go with defaults.\n\n375\n00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,630\nIf you need to be more rapid though,\nyou might wanna lower that number.\n\n376\n00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,880\nLike if I said, 10 seconds to probes.\n\n377\n00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,030\nThen that would mean after only 20 seconds\nI just type the failure and bump it.\n\n378\n00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,150\nSo you control that interval.\n\n379\n00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,820\n>> When it detects a failure,\ndoes it email that to you or\n\n380\n00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,110\ndoes it automatically do something?\n\n381\n00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,780\n>> So, by default all it's gonna do is\n\n382\n00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,240\nkinda automatically stop\nsending traffic to that node.\n\n383\n00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,130\nIt will keep sending\ntraffic to the other nodes.\n\n384\n00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,510\nRight?\nBut not this one.\n\n385\n00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,340\nIf you want to do notifications,\nyou have to go in and\n\n386\n00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,110\nconfigure some of the reporting and\ninsight and stuff like that.\n\n387\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,680\nSo there's additional stuff\nyou can figure that going.\n\n388\n00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,190\n>> Cool.\n>> All right but at this point,\n\n389\n00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:16,086\nI now have a end point here, HTTP, and\nI can see that it's a load balanced set.\n\n390\n00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:21,220\nIt's in ITProTV-web farm so all I have\nto do now is go to my other nodes.\n\n391\n00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,700\nAnd add them to that\nsame load balance set.\n\n392\n00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,030\nSo if I go to web02 and I go to its\nendpoints, I can add an endpoint.\n\n393\n00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,870\nAnd this time I can just choose to add\nto an existing load balance set and,\n\n394\n00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,210\nI keep doing that where\nI jump too fast and\n\n395\n00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,340\nit won't, it hasn't actually\nprovisioned the other one yet.\n\n396\n00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,700\nSo I gotta wait a moment\nwhile it provisions that one.\n\n397\n00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,180\nSo that is the case with\nsome of this stuff.\n\n398\n00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,510\nYou just have to give it a moment.\n\n399\n00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,682\nBut we can give it some time, or-\n>> Wait for the computer to compute.\n\n400\n00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:49,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> And just take one of these other ones.\n\n401\n00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,620\nActually, it might be angry,\nbecause one of those is a Linux VM.\n\n402\n00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,820\n>> Oh.\n>> And the other is a Windows VM.\n\n403\n00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,722\nSo it might not want\nto load balance those.\n\n404\n00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:57,460\n>> There's some bad\nblood between those two.\n\n405\n00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n406\n00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,557\n[LAUGH] They're so angry.\n\n407\n00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,487\n[LAUGH] But so we can go in and\n\n408\n00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,097\nwe can configure that.\nI just have to wait for\n\n409\n00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:06,757\nthat one to appear, it'll turn up, but\ngive it a few moments, and you'll be able\n\n410\n00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,940\nto choose that option right there.\nYou pick the existing low balance set,\n\n411\n00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,530\nand now traffic that's being\nsent to that one end point will\n\n412\n00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,170\nbe distributed across these nodes,\nand that'll take care that.\n\n413\n00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,840\nCombine that with availability sets and\nnow you're really in business.\n\n414\n00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,120\nYou'll be able to balance that\ntraffic out and you'll be protected\n\n415\n00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,220\nnot only from faults on Microsoft's\nside the physical hardware side, but\n\n416\n00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,360\non your side the software side.\n\n417\n00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,350\nIf you ever have outages or\n\n418\n00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,690\nfailures there's always other nodes\nthat are there and ready to take over.\n\n419\n00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,730\n>> That's a very, very nice feature to\nhave to say my downtime is gonna be\n\n420\n00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,480\nbasically as minimal as possible.\n\n421\n00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,510\nAnd the more that we work with these\ntypes of devices and spin up these and\n\n422\n00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,190\ncreate more VMs, maybe.\n\n423\n00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,800\nSo that I can increase that set\nthat's being load balanced.\n\n424\n00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,240\nCuz the more options that I have for\n\n425\n00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,570\nit to load balance, too, the better\navailability I'm probably going to have.\n\n426\n00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,510\nSo it's always a good thing.\n\n427\n00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,720\nAnd then you can do the whole, I mean,\n\n428\n00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,920\nthey give you plenty of options\nhere to say, well, we'll put it on.\n\n429\n00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,860\nPut one on the west coast.\n\n430\n00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,320\nThat way in case for whatever reason our\nwhole easy coast system goes down, well,\n\n431\n00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,350\nyou're not in the weeds,\nyou can just continue.\n\n432\n00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,300\nIt'll just jump right over to there and\nit keeps that downtime.\n\n433\n00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,290\nCuz I know downtime,\neven at a small percentage,\n\n434\n00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,010\nI think 99.98% of the time,\nyou have uptime.\n\n435\n00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,000\nThat really does equate to quite\na bit of time where it's not online.\n\n436\n00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,360\n>> Yeah, and it's easy to think of these\ncloud providers as being infallible but\n\n437\n00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,110\nthey've all had downtime.\n\n438\n00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,460\nMicrosoft's Azure had downtime before.\n\n439\n00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,460\nAmazon's AWS has had downtime.\n\n440\n00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,240\nIt happens, and it's usually\nrelated to something crazy like\n\n441\n00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,140\nBGP routing tables on the Internet and\nnot related to power or\n\n442\n00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,480\nnetwork, internal network or\nair conditioning or something like that.\n\n443\n00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,950\nThey think that's all planned out, so\n\n444\n00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,020\nthere are some things that\nare beyond their control.\n\n445\n00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,100\nHaving servers in more than one region,\nhaving servers and availability sets like\n\n446\n00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,700\nthis, these are all just little steps we\ncan take to better protect our system.\n\n447\n00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,930\nBut otherwise those are just two of\nthe big things that we want to get set up.\n\n448\n00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,450\nDaniel, I know you mentioned about\nnotifying it if something is down.\n\n449\n00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,960\nJust to cover that real quickly on each\nVM when you go into a virtual machine and\n\n450\n00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,610\nyou go into its configure screen, right\nwhere we see things like the availability\n\n451\n00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,750\nset, down beneath that you'll see\nmonitoring, and that's where we can set\n\n452\n00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,590\nup to monitor the end points to make\nsure that they're up and healthy.\n\n453\n00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,280\nSo if I come in here and\ngive this one a name, I'll call it HTTP.\n\n454\n00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,050\nIt's going to monitor that server,\nand then I can set the test locations,\n\n455\n00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,880\nwho it's going to test from.\n\n456\n00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,900\nSo I'll test this one from Chicago and\nDublin, right?\n\n457\n00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,230\nIt's nice to get intercontinental views.\n\n458\n00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,920\nAnd so that's going to check and now that\nwill be able to send me notifications and\n\n459\n00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,370\nlet me know if this node is down or\nup or healthy or whatever.\n\n460\n00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,920\nI'll be able to stay up to date on\nthat and actually get notifications.\n\n461\n00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,470\nSo it's an extra little step that\nyou may or may not need to do.\n\n462\n00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,140\nDepending you might not\nwant notifications.\n\n463\n00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,070\n>> Yeah, then there's those out\nthere that love notifications.\n\n464\n00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,490\nI know where I used to work, we'd get so\nmany of them that it was mind numbing.\n\n465\n00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,470\nYou'd be like oh.\n\n466\n00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,970\nI don't really need this information.\n\n467\n00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,310\nBut our boss at the time just loved them.\n\n468\n00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,920\nHe loved any kind.\nAnytime you could set a notification,\n\n469\n00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,862\nwe were getting it.\n\n470\n00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:14,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n471\n00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,600\nWell, Daniel, that's really about it.\n\n472\n00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,900\nJust remember that it is a rare day that\nyou don't configure availability sets and\n\n473\n00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,460\nload balancing sets together.\n\n474\n00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,690\nYou don't have to, though.\n\n475\n00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,040\nYou might have a SQL database and\n\n476\n00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,640\njust a replica of it that you're\nnot load balancing on but\n\n477\n00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,020\nyou just want them in different\navailability, in different fault domains.\n\n478\n00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,930\nAnd so\nyou use availability sets there, too.\n\n479\n00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,390\nThere's plenty of places were\nyou might use them individually.\n\n480\n00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,050\nTypically it is done together.\n\n481\n00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,810\n>> Awesome.\n\n482\n00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,130\nWell I guess that brings us to the end\nof another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n483\n00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,770\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n484\n00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,020\nThat being said it is time to sign off.\n\n485\n00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,340\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n486\n00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,350\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n487\n00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,985\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:56,900\n[SOUND]\n\n",

great\nepisode episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,180\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie, and here\nwith me today is my good friend Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,130\nHow are you doing today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,220\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,790\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of Microsoft Azure.\n\n8\n00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,370\nToday we're gonna be taking a look at\na slightly different technology, storage.\n\n9\n00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,870\n>> No.\n>> What?\n\n10\n00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,375\n>> Storage?\n\n11\n00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:30,900\n[LAUGH] >> Just storage.\nSo\n\n12\n00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,320\nwhen you talk about virtual machines and\nSQL servers,\n\n13\n00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,770\ndatabases, all this high data stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,800\nSometimes we forget about the easy ones.\n\n15\n00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,140\nThings like storage, just sticking a file\nin the cloud so people can download it.\n\n16\n00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,610\nIt's one of the easier topics,\n\n17\n00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,200\nbut it is one of the functions\nthat we have inside of Azure.\n\n18\n00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,100\nIt's one that a lot of\npeople take advantage of.\n\n19\n00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,450\nIt's very inexpensive,\nit's a great resource.\n\n20\n00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,730\nSo we're gonna look at how to use that.\n\n21\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,960\nHow to get our data thrown out there, and\n\n22\n00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,910\ntake advantage of what\nMicrosoft has to offer.\n\n23\n00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,930\n>> Now I was gonna say Don,\nthis is probably something that most\n\n24\n00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,010\npeople actually use on a day to day basis,\nand don't probably realize it.\n\n25\n00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,410\n>> Oh yeah absolutely.\n\n26\n00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,280\nWell I mean if you're watching\nthis video right now,\n\n27\n00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,910\nthe odds are it's probably coming\nfrom cloud storage somewhere.\n\n28\n00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,400\nAnd it might be Azure,\nit might be AWS, or somewhere else.\n\n29\n00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,870\nBut cloud storage is\na great way to do that.\n\n30\n00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,150\nAnd there's a few main reasons why.\n\n31\n00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,470\nFor example, let's say that I had a file,\njust a PDF document,\n\n32\n00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,430\nand I wanted to give it to you, Daniel.\n\n33\n00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,750\nWell, the old school was, I'll just\nattach it to an email and send it to you.\n\n34\n00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,230\nBut what if the file's really big?\n\n35\n00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,430\nIt's not gonna fit on an email anymore, so\nI need some other way to get it to you.\n\n36\n00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,610\nI could trust some third party providers.\n\n37\n00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,770\nI could try Dropbox or whatever.\n\n38\n00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,620\nBut if I'm a company, and\nI'm gonna have thousands or\n\n39\n00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,550\ntens of thousands of people\ndownloading this resource,\n\n40\n00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,080\nthis file, I don't want to rely\non Dropbox, some other company.\n\n41\n00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,490\nI wanna be able to\ncontrol that data myself.\n\n42\n00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,940\nAnd I want it to be white labelled so\nthat people don't see the brand.\n\n43\n00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,820\nYou know, if you download from Dropbox,\nyou see Dropbox page and all that.\n\n44\n00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,980\nI want it to look like\nit's coming from me.\n\n45\n00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,490\nSo, what I can do is I can take my files,\nand\n\n46\n00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,450\nI can store them in Windows Azure or\nMicrosoft Azure.\n\n47\n00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,870\nI can store them in Amazon S3 or\nsomewhere like that.\n\n48\n00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,300\nAnd when people go to download the files,\n\n49\n00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,530\nyou know they're on my website,\nthey click through the various links.\n\n50\n00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,120\nAnd when they go to download file it\ncomes from one of those cloud providers.\n\n51\n00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,580\nNow if they're on my website,\n\n52\n00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,350\nI could just have them download\nthe file from my website right.\n\n53\n00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,850\nBut the problem there is my website might\nbe stored in one data center in the US.\n\n54\n00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440\nand I've got clients that went\nto download this file and\n\n55\n00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,970\nthey're in Australia, or\nEurope, or South America.\n\n56\n00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,030\nAnd they're gonna get slower downloads.\n\n57\n00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,310\nSo wouldn't it be nice if we could\nupload that file somewhere and\n\n58\n00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,810\nhave it geolocated?\n\n59\n00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,650\nHave it where if you're in Australia and\nyou go to download this file,\n\n60\n00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,840\nyou're getting it in Australia.\n\n61\n00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,310\nThat it's being pulled from\nsomewhere local to you.\n\n62\n00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,060\nThat it's highly redundant storage.\n\n63\n00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,710\nIn case there's a failure\nthe data gets preserved.\n\n64\n00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,690\nThat's what using the storage\nservices in Azure can do for us.\n\n65\n00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,690\nMicrosoft has a ton of power tucked in\nthis, so it looks really simple at first.\n\n66\n00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,420\nJust file storage.\n\n67\n00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,800\nBut it is a really powerful thing,\nand we do use it a lot.\n\n68\n00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,560\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat Azure's services for this.\n\n69\n00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,550\nSo, I'm logged in here on my laptop\ninto my Azure management portal, and\n\n70\n00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,570\nas I browse down the left side of stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,990\nWe see things like virtual machines and\n\n72\n00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,010\nSQL databases that we\ncover in other episodes.\n\n73\n00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,810\nAnd then right here we've got storage.\n\n74\n00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,650\nAll right?\nNow, when you go into storage,\n\n75\n00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,900\nwhat you're gonna do is you're gonna come\nin here and create a new storage account.\n\n76\n00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,970\nYou can create multiple storage accounts\nto isolate, and separate your data.\n\n77\n00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,580\nAnd there's various reasons for that.\n\n78\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,430\nI might have some data that\nI want to be private and\n\n79\n00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,720\nsome data that I want to have public.\n\n80\n00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,430\nAnd so there's different ways\nthat we can divide that.\n\n81\n00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,510\nNow, when we go to create our storage,\n\n82\n00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,820\nwe're gonna see that there's actually two\ndifferent ways to provide the storage.\n\n83\n00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,800\nThe way that we normally think\nof is what's called a container.\n\n84\n00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,880\nOur files get stuck in a container, and\n\n85\n00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,940\npeople can download the data\nfrom the container.\n\n86\n00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,400\nIt's like a shared folder on a hard drive,\nor a file share on a server, an FTP site.\n\n87\n00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,020\nAny of the different ways that you\nmight have moved files in the past,\n\n88\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,070\nthat's what a container is.\n\n89\n00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,020\nA table is the other option.\n\n90\n00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,030\nAnd you might look at that and\n\n91\n00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,140\nsay, well what the heck is\na table in terms of files?\n\n92\n00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,860\nWell, a table is actually\ntalking about a database.\n\n93\n00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,740\nThat Microsoft can store\nyour files in a database\n\n94\n00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,720\ninstead of just in a raw container.\n\n95\n00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,020\nNow for most of us, that's a bad thing.\n\n96\n00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,340\nWe don't want that.\n\n97\n00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,650\nBut if you have millions of files,\nIt can be difficult to quickly locate and\n\n98\n00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,330\nretrieve the proper file and\nreturn that to somebody.\n\n99\n00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,020\nSo, one way to get around that is\nto store those files in a database.\n\n100\n00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,650\nAnd when you do that it's in a table,\nand each file has an ID attached to it.\n\n101\n00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,260\nAnd you can query for\nthat ID and do quick retrieval.\n\n102\n00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,220\nMicrosoft did a demo of this years ago.\n\n103\n00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,690\nWhere they took their\nMicrosoft Maps product,\n\n104\n00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,630\nand it's changed names over the years.\n\n105\n00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,920\nI don't know what it's called anymore.\n\n106\n00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,300\nBut whatever Microsoft Maps' service is.\n\n107\n00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,200\nCuz it was Expedia maps or\nsomething, oh, whatever.\n\n108\n00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,130\nBut what they did is they took\nthe satellite imagery of the Earth.\n\n109\n00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,040\nSo they'd have these plates that\nwere images of say, a square mile.\n\n110\n00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,790\nWell, the Earth is 26,000 miles around.\n\n111\n00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,770\nIt's hundreds of thousands, if not\nmillions of square miles in surface.\n\n112\n00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,400\nThat's a lot of images.\n\n113\n00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,860\nSo they threw them all in a database.\n\n114\n00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,720\nAnd they indexed them based\non longitude and latitude.\n\n115\n00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,260\nAnd so when you wanted to\nretrieve satellite imagery for\n\n116\n00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,300\na city, you did a query based\non latitude and longitude.\n\n117\n00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,580\nAnd it returned whatever image you had\nstored in the database right there.\n\n118\n00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,000\nQuick, fast, and easy.\n\n119\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,080\nSo if you're dealing with huge amounts of\ndata, you'll want to store it in a table.\n\n120\n00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,470\nBut if you're just dealing\nwith individual files,\n\n121\n00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,410\nthings that you want a simple URL for\npeople to access.\n\n122\n00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,630\nYou're gonna store those\nin what are called a BLOB.\n\n123\n00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,220\nA BLOB is where it's just a file\nstored right in a container and\n\n124\n00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,400\npeople can download it.\n\n125\n00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,480\nAnd that's what most of us are gonna use.\n\n126\n00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,770\nIn the web UI, we can work with blobs,\n\n127\n00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,510\nwe can work with containers,\nwe can't work with tables.\n\n128\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,510\nWe'll see the tables,\nwe'll know they're there, but\n\n129\n00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,580\nyou really have to use the Azure API\nto create those and work in them.\n\n130\n00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,440\nSo that's a pretty advanced one,\nit's really designed for developers.\n\n131\n00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400\nBut if I just need to get some\nfiles online, I need to come in and\n\n132\n00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,340\ncreate a storage account.\n\n133\n00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,270\nSo we go to storage over here\nin our management screen,\n\n134\n00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,890\nand we hit our little New button.\n\n135\n00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,250\nAnd you'll see I've got new\ndata service for storage.\n\n136\n00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,490\nAnd I don't have a lot of choices here.\n\n137\n00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,480\nI really just have Quick Create, right?\n\n138\n00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,010\nIt's gonna create a storage account for\nme.\n\n139\n00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,960\nAnd I just need to give it a name.\n\n140\n00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,700\nThe name is going to be the URL.\n\n141\n00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,480\nAnd you can put capital letters in here if\nyou want, but at the end of the day it's\n\n142\n00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,410\ngonna make them all lowercase, so\nyou might as well just type all lowercase.\n\n143\n00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,420\nAnd it's gonna create a web address with\nwhatever you type here.core.windows.net.\n\n144\n00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,800\nThat's gonna be the address for\nthis account.\n\n145\n00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,240\nSo, if I create an account\ncalled ITProTV-files.\n\n146\n00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,620\nOops, it doesn't like my hyphen.\n\n147\n00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,680\nLet me get rid of the hyphen.\n\n148\n00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,530\nThere, ITProTVfiles.\n\n149\n00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,154\nThen what I'm gonna have at the end of\nthe day is ITProTVfiles.core.windows.net.\n\n150\n00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,790\nAnd then I can pick the affinity group.\n\n151\n00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,720\nThis is where it's gonna be located, and\n\n152\n00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,890\nyou'll see several of the different data\ncenters that are available to my account.\n\n153\n00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,010\nYour account might have\naccess to other ones.\n\n154\n00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,590\nFor example if you look in here, notice I\ndon't have any Australian data centers.\n\n155\n00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,960\nRight now Microsoft limits those\nto just people in Australia.\n\n156\n00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,330\nSo if you are Australian,\n\n157\n00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,920\nyou'll see a couple extra data\ncenters here that I don't get.\n\n158\n00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,500\nBut you'll see the ones\nthat are available to you.\n\n159\n00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,040\nI'll pick East US for mine.\n\n160\n00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,610\nAnd then the replication.\n\n161\n00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,470\nReplication is important.\n\n162\n00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,860\nYou'll see we've got four\noptions in here to pick from.\n\n163\n00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,440\nAnd each one is a little bit different.\n\n164\n00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,420\nSo let me run down the list.\n\n165\n00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,410\nLocally redundant is the first one.\n\n166\n00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,880\nThis is actually the weakest level of\nredundancy that's available to me here.\n\n167\n00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,320\nWith locally redundant,\n\n168\n00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,390\nit means that Microsoft is gonna\nmaintain at least two copies of my data.\n\n169\n00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,300\nRight there in the same data center.\n\n170\n00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,410\nIn that same region and that's it.\n\n171\n00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,130\nSo, if one copy of my data\ngets damaged somehow,\n\n172\n00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,650\nlike a failed hard drive,\nthey've got a second copy.\n\n173\n00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,690\nSo we're covered.\n\n174\n00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,200\nThat's a pretty good one.\n\n175\n00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,520\nBut what if that whole\ndata center goes down?\n\n176\n00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,990\nWell, both of my copies were right\nthere in the same data center.\n\n177\n00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,100\nSo that doesn't help so much.\n\n178\n00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,200\nMaybe we're not worried about that,\n\n179\n00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,020\nbut Azure has had some\ndowntime over the years.\n\n180\n00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,640\nNot much, but they have had some.\n\n181\n00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,209\nSo if I wanna protect from\na data center going down,\n\n182\n00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,953\nI can choose to go with zone redundant.\n\n183\n00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:09,080\nZone redundant says that Microsoft will\nmaintain at least three copies of my data.\n\n184\n00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,250\nTwo copies in the zone where I create\nthis, so in my case East US, and\n\n185\n00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,460\nthen one copy in a zone at least\n100 miles away from this one.\n\n186\n00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,620\nSo if I'm in East US it's\nnot gonna pick East US 2.\n\n187\n00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,770\nIt's too close.\n\n188\n00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,940\nIt'll pick one that's further away,\nlike West US or Central US.\n\n189\n00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,850\nProbably Central US, that's in Iowa.\n\n190\n00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,930\nSo it'll pick that one, and\nit's more than 100 miles away.\n\n191\n00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,080\nSo now I get redundancy even for\nthe data center, all right?\n\n192\n00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,200\nBut notice down here,\nit says only block blobs are supported for\n\n193\n00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,610\nzone redundant, tables won't be.\n\n194\n00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,570\nSo it's just kind of give me that warning\nI won't be able to use tables there.\n\n195\n00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,910\nTables are still somewhat kind of new,\nand so\n\n196\n00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,910\nyou'll see some features\ndon't work with them.\n\n197\n00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,950\n>> Don, can you choose that third zone, or\ndo you have to leave that up to Microsoft?\n\n198\n00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,690\n>> You have to leave that up to Microsoft.\n\n199\n00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,380\nAnd the reason you do is because\n\n200\n00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,360\nwhen you copy your data they've gotta\nreplicate it to the other data centers.\n\n201\n00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,820\nAnd that takes bandwidth.\n\n202\n00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,280\nAnd they're metering their bandwidth and\nwatching it, and so\n\n203\n00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,640\nthey might see that bandwidth is\nbeing overwhelmed to one data center.\n\n204\n00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,950\nAnd their concern is making sure they've\ngot a redundant copy of your data.\n\n205\n00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,280\nNot necessarily where it is.\n\n206\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640\nSo they'll relocate it based on its needs.\n\n207\n00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640\nAnd it might move.\n>> I was gonna say, so it's better for\n\n208\n00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,680\nthem to actually handle\nthis instead of you.\n\n209\n00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,390\n>> Yes.\nAnd at the end of the day it's better for\n\n210\n00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,640\nyou too,\ncuz you want latency in your backup.\n\n211\n00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,560\nAll right, we've also got geo redundant.\n\n212\n00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,220\nGeo redundant's the coolest.\n\n213\n00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,710\nNow, it plans your redundancy\nbased on geography.\n\n214\n00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,260\nAnd it's sending your data, and\n\n215\n00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,790\nI forget the amount,\nI think it's five data centers.\n\n216\n00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,570\nWhere it spreads it across the globe.\n\n217\n00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,500\nAnd there's two benefits to that.\n\n218\n00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,800\nOne benefit is, if multiple data centers\ngo down you still have your data.\n\n219\n00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,840\nThat's cool.\n\n220\n00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,790\nBut the other benefit,\nwhen people go to access files,\n\n221\n00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,820\nthey'll get the file from\nthe closest data center to them.\n\n222\n00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,410\nSo if they're in Europe,\nthey'll pull from a European data center.\n\n223\n00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,590\nIf they're in Asia,\nthey'll pull from an Asian data center.\n\n224\n00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,520\nAnd that gets them a faster experience\nwhen they go to download and access files.\n\n225\n00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,920\nAnd then the last one is\nRead-Access Geo-Redundant.\n\n226\n00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,290\nWith read access, this is where\nwe're saying we've got our main one\n\n227\n00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,620\nthat we can write files to, and then we've\ngot copies that are all just read only.\n\n228\n00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620\nRight?\nNow you can't\n\n229\n00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,760\nactually do updates to those other copies.\n\n230\n00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,430\nWhen you update your main\none it replicates out so\n\n231\n00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,620\nthey don't have to do two way.\n\n232\n00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,970\nThat kind of conserves a little bit of\nresource utilization on Microsoft's side.\n\n233\n00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,224\nSo a couple of different options\nthere to improve that performance.\n\n234\n00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:21,760\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,500\nBut for mine, since this is just a test\nshow, I'll just do Locally Redundant.\n\n236\n00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,070\nSo it must be right here\nin this data center.\n\n237\n00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,250\nOr you know, here,\nI'll go Zone Redundant, all right.\n\n238\n00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,050\nSo I'll go ahead and create that now.\n\n239\n00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,970\nWell actually,\nthen I won't see my little table options.\n\n240\n00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,050\nLet me go back to local.\n\n241\n00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,800\nWe'll stick with that for now.\n\n242\n00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,500\nAll right, so it's gonna whip that up, and\n\n243\n00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,010\nI see I've got a new storage account\nbeing created right there, ITProTV files.\n\n244\n00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,620\nI already had a storage account\ncalled ITProTV storage demo, so\n\n245\n00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,840\nthat one's sitting there and it's online.\n\n246\n00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,940\nAnd the reason I did that is,\nsee how this one's creating?\n\n247\n00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,470\nIt can take a moment for these\naccounts to get created and in place.\n\n248\n00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,810\nAnd if I'm a patient person I\ncan sit here and wait for it but\n\n249\n00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,025\nI'm not a patient person.\n\n250\n00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:00,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n251\n00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,070\nactually, this has been pretty quick.\n\n252\n00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,270\nYeah, it already went online.\n\n253\n00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,680\nWell, I guess I stalled long enough.\n\n254\n00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,050\nSo [LAUGH], all right,\nso there's my account,\n\n255\n00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,150\nthose ITProTV files it's created but\nit doesn't actually do anything yet.\n\n256\n00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,000\nIt doesn't do anything until I create some\nkind of storage repositories inside of it,\n\n257\n00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,530\neither a table or a container.\n\n258\n00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,470\nSo when I come in here into the files,\nit gives me my little welcome screen.\n\n259\n00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,000\nI'm gonna ignore that and\ngo right to my dashboard.\n\n260\n00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,600\nAnd in the dashboard, I can see some basic\ninformation about the storage account.\n\n261\n00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,550\nNow, there's gonna be a report here that's\ngonna basically be empty cuz there's no\n\n262\n00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,950\nactivity and\nthis is a brand new repository.\n\n263\n00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,120\nBut as I look down I can see my URL for\nblobs and my URL for tables.\n\n264\n00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,230\nIt's telling me where I can go\nto be able to find this data\n\n265\n00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,060\nif I want people to be able to access it.\n\n266\n00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,940\nSo, we see that kind of access.\n\n267\n00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,800\nThere's a new file share service\nthat's coming out soon so\n\n268\n00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,590\nit lists that one too in queues.\n\n269\n00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,350\nQueues are designed for workflows.\n\n270\n00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,100\nFile come in, you perform some\nkind of action, file goes out.\n\n271\n00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,880\nThose are not manageable by the web UI\neither, that's something that's part of\n\n272\n00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,960\nthe API, but that's what some\nof these other services are.\n\n273\n00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,912\nBut for right now, blobs and tables,\nthose are the two main ones.\n\n274\n00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:09,930\nAll right.\n\n275\n00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,360\nNow, the monitoring is disabled by\ndefault, and one thing I always\n\n276\n00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,330\nrecommend to people is it should\nbe the first thing you configure.\n\n277\n00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,280\nIf you're wanting to monitor and keep\nan eye on how your usage is being done,\n\n278\n00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,480\nhow much data have you\ntransferred out this week or\n\n279\n00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,840\nhow many files have been written,\nyou need to turn it on as soon as you can.\n\n280\n00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,152\nBecause when you turn it on, let's say\nI've been running this for a month, and\n\n281\n00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,365\nI turn it on today, well, all the records\nfrom the previous month are already\n\n282\n00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,862\ngone and you don't get those back.\n\n283\n00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:39,478\nSo you want to make sure you\nturn it on before you need it,\n\n284\n00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,350\nnot turn it on after you need it.\n\n285\n00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,970\n>> Is there a way to automate that at all?\n\n286\n00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,860\nLike if I wanted all the new\nstorage servers that I bring up to\n\n287\n00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,640\nhave that feature enabled so I don't have\nto go through, do they allow that or?\n\n288\n00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,970\n>> Not through the web UI.\n\n289\n00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,720\n>> Okay.\n\n290\n00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,820\n>> But they do through some of\nthe other products that are out there.\n\n291\n00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,720\nRemember, like, Microsoft Azure, they\nhave a lot of support built into this for\n\n292\n00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,090\nMicrosoft System Center.\n\n293\n00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,070\nSo if you're using the System Center suite\nit can provision a lot of this stuff and\n\n294\n00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,220\nauto configure it.\n\n295\n00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,260\nBut from the web UI you\njust gotta do it by hand.\n\n296\n00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,150\nBut it's not a big deal, right?\n\n297\n00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,160\nWe create it.\n\n298\n00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,690\nWe jump over to the configuration page,\nand we just turn on monitoring here.\n\n299\n00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,120\nWe can also change our replication here,\nright?\n\n300\n00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,481\nSo, I chose locally\nredundant during the wizard.\n\n301\n00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,980\nI could flip over to geo redundant or\nread access geo redundant, right?\n\n302\n00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,080\nSo I've got those options,\nI can flip them.\n\n303\n00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,350\nI have lost the option to choose zone\nredundant, and the reason is now that I've\n\n304\n00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,970\ncome up locally,\nI've got the ability to create tables.\n\n305\n00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,808\nAnd tables weren't supported with\na zone redundant option, and so\n\n306\n00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:36,361\nthat one's now gone for me, right.\n\n307\n00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:38,074\nSo you, depending on what you've chosen,\n\n308\n00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:39,940\nyou might actually have\na fourth option there.\n\n309\n00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,990\nDown below though, here's my monitoring.\n\n310\n00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,390\nDo I wanna do monitoring for\nblobs, tables and queues?\n\n311\n00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,520\nWell I'm not gonna use tables and queues,\nI'll just leave those off, but for\n\n312\n00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,710\nblobs, I'll turn on minimal recording.\n\n313\n00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,510\nI don't wanna go too verbose.\n\n314\n00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,430\nIf you have millions of\npeople downloading files,\n\n315\n00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,530\nI don't wanna record of\nevery single one of those.\n\n316\n00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,120\nOr maybe I do.\n\n317\n00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,180\nRight?\nIt depends.\n\n318\n00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,670\nSome people want all that data.\n\n319\n00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,920\nThen you pick your data retention.\n\n320\n00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,332\nI'll retain data for, we'll go seven days.\n\n321\n00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:05,954\nAll right?\n\n322\n00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:08,310\nBut now, it's gonna do some basic logging.\n\n323\n00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,470\nMinimal logging of when files are created,\nwhen files are deleted.\n\n324\n00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,570\nAnd it's gonna store seven\ndays worth of that data.\n\n325\n00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,550\nAfter seven days, it purges and\nthen we just have the newer data.\n\n326\n00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,571\n>> I know some IT managers out there\nthat would love that verbose [LAUGH].\n\n327\n00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:23,410\n>> Yeah, there are plenty.\n\n328\n00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,940\nDown here is where we actually get to\npick and choose what counts for logging.\n\n329\n00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,850\nSo under blobs,\nI can do reads if I care about that, or\n\n330\n00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,240\nI might just be more concerned\nwith writes and deletes.\n\n331\n00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,670\nI wanna know any time somebody\nadds a file or modifies a file.\n\n332\n00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,880\nThat would be a write.\n\n333\n00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,050\nOr somebody deletes.\n\n334\n00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,770\nBut if somebody reads,\nI might have millions of people reading.\n\n335\n00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,580\nI don't wanna mess with it.\n\n336\n00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,820\nOr if this is paid content that I've\ncontrolled access to I may want to log\n\n337\n00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,640\nthose reads.\n\n338\n00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,070\nAnd so I can specify that, and\nagain, the retention period.\n\n339\n00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,650\nAll right.\n\n340\n00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,240\nSame thing for tables and queues,\nyou can define that right here.\n\n341\n00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,830\nSo on this configure screen,\nwe've got our redundancy, and our logging.\n\n342\n00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,370\nWe need to set all that, and\nthen this is the part I always forget,\n\n343\n00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,400\ngotta hit that save button\ndown at the bottom.\n\n344\n00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,490\nI'll hit save, and\nthat's gonna put that in place.\n\n345\n00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,600\nAnd now, I'm actually logging,\n\n346\n00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,720\nif I go back to my dashboard, this report\nit's still not gonna be very exciting\n\n347\n00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,920\nbecause you know I don't have the files\nin there, but I am actually seeing\n\n348\n00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,460\nthat the report is working now I can get\nsome basic information about my storage.\n\n349\n00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:25,500\nAll right the next thing I need to do is I\nprobably need to get some files in here.\n\n350\n00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,730\nRight?\nIt's not going to do me\n\n351\n00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,330\nmuch good without that.\n\n352\n00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,260\nWell, my files need to be\nput into containers and so\n\n353\n00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,790\nI'm gonna jump over to this containers\ntab, and I've got no containers right now,\n\n354\n00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,950\nwhich means there's nowhere for\nme to put files.\n\n355\n00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,870\nThink of a container as like a folder.\n\n356\n00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,850\nIt's like creating folders\ninside of this drive.\n\n357\n00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,740\nSo, the storage account, ItProTV files.\n\n358\n00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,181\nThat's like my hard drive.\n\n359\n00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,250\nAnd then containers are like\nfolders inside of it.\n\n360\n00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,390\nAnd so I'm gonna create a container.\n\n361\n00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,670\nI'm gonna give it a name.\n\n362\n00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,002\nMaybe I'll call these my public documents\nand I can set the access level,\n\n363\n00:15:56,002 --> 00:16:01,421\ndo I want it to be private, public\ncontainer, or public blob, all right.\n\n364\n00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:05,381\nPublic blob is talking about like\nmaking an individual file public.\n\n365\n00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,607\nPublic container It means\nthe whole container and\n\n366\n00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,072\nall the stuff that I put inside there.\n\n367\n00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:14,447\nIf I want to allow people to download\nstuff, I want to choose public containers,\n\n368\n00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,120\nso I'll go ahead and choose that.\n\n369\n00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,170\nBut I might want to choose private,\n\n370\n00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,730\nit's kind of up to me how\nwe want to set that up.\n\n371\n00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,930\nHere in the web UI, we get really\nsimple permissions management.\n\n372\n00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,580\nIn the command line interface,\nyou can get super granular.\n\n373\n00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,510\nYou can set permissions for one file\nthat are different from another file,\n\n374\n00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,020\nyou can get really\nspecific with this stuff.\n\n375\n00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,160\nAll right, so I've got this public\ndocuments, I'll go ahead and create that.\n\n376\n00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,210\nAnd I might want to come behind that and\ncreate another container.\n\n377\n00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,160\nSo I'll go and add another one,\nthat I might call my private documents.\n\n378\n00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,330\nAnd I'll leave that one set to private,\nand I'll get that one created.\n\n379\n00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,950\nSo now I've got two containers\nin place to store data, and\n\n380\n00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,290\nit's giving me a URL over here.\n\n381\n00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,470\nIf somebody wants to access a file,\nthey need to browse to this\n\n382\n00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,308\nlink,\nhttps://itprotvfiles.blob.core.windows.ne-\n\n383\n00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:06,270\nt/privatedocuments, or /publicdocuments.\n\n384\n00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,530\nNow if you don't want to give that address\nto your customers, I don't blame you.\n\n385\n00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,680\nIt's kind of a long one, blob,\npeople don't know what that means.\n\n386\n00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,280\nSo you'll probably use like a DNSC\nname to map one of your names to this.\n\n387\n00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,930\nI might map files.itpro.tv\nto one of these.\n\n388\n00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,660\nAnd so then somebody would be browsing\nto files.itpro.tv/privatedocuments.\n\n389\n00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,800\nAnd then they would get that folder and\nget in there.\n\n390\n00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,610\nJust be careful if you're using C names,\nbecause these are https links by default.\n\n391\n00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,170\nThey're secure, and the SSL certificate\ndomain name won't match your C name.\n\n392\n00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,840\nSo there's some extra steps you\ncan take to get that configured.\n\n393\n00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,709\nJust be aware of that.\n\n394\n00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,810\nAll right, now that that's done,\nmy containers are in place.\n\n395\n00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,930\nI need to put some files in there.\n\n396\n00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,730\nNow putting files in there is,\nunfortunately,\n\n397\n00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,840\na little trickier than it should be.\n\n398\n00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,120\n[LAUGH] From the web UI there's\nactually not a way to put files\n\n399\n00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,580\ninto those containers.\n\n400\n00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,620\nI know, shocking.\n\n401\n00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,820\nMicrosoft is working on a new portal.\n\n402\n00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,700\nIt's going to be out soon,\nthe beta's actually out now.\n\n403\n00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,650\nI haven't been using it, but\nif you go up here to like your menu,\n\n404\n00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,830\nyou'll see Switch to Azure Preview Portal.\n\n405\n00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,180\nThat will jump into the new portal, and\n\n406\n00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,710\nthey actually do have where you can\nupload files there on the new one.\n\n407\n00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,240\nBut it's all still in beta,\nso that may change.\n\n408\n00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,450\nUnder the current system,\nthere's two ways to get files in.\n\n409\n00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,630\nThe easiest way, especially if you have a\nlot of files, is that you can take a hard\n\n410\n00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,420\ndrive, a physical hard drive, put all your\nfiles on there, and mail it to Microsoft.\n\n411\n00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,470\nAnd they'll load it in there for you.\n\n412\n00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,640\nAll right,\n\n413\n00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,860\nif you got terabytes of data, that's\nway faster than trying to upload it.\n\n414\n00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,970\nAnd so that's really the way Microsoft\nintends for this to be used for for\n\n415\n00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,210\ncorporations, is you mail in a drive.\n\n416\n00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,840\nAnd if I go up here to Import/Export,\nthis is where I can do that.\n\n417\n00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,440\nI can come down here and\nI can create an import job.\n\n418\n00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,100\nAnd when I do that what it's going\nto do is, we're going to say,\n\n419\n00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,930\nwe're going to get a hard drive ready and\nthen as we move forward,\n\n420\n00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,270\nwe're gonna put our contact information,\nour return address, and\n\n421\n00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,450\nthen if I keep going it's gonna ask\nme to put in a tracking number.\n\n422\n00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,440\nSo that I can send it via UPS, and\nthey have a tracking number so\n\n423\n00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,710\nthey know when they receive it\nwhich customer it belongs to.\n\n424\n00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,470\nAnd then they can take it and load it in.\n\n425\n00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,970\nAnd then I just come in here and\n\n426\n00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,230\nI can view my status reports, you'll\nsee these other buttons light up, and\n\n427\n00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,750\nyou can pull that information up and track\nit and see when the data gets in there.\n\n428\n00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,140\nThat's one way.\n\n429\n00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,180\nBut what if I need the files\nin there right now?\n\n430\n00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,375\nWell this way takes a long time,\nso I don't want to wait for that.\n\n431\n00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,495\nSo instead,\n\n432\n00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,495\nwe can use a third party software\npackage to connect and move the files.\n\n433\n00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:31,945\nHere inside of my storage screen,\nif I go back to my main storage page.\n\n434\n00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:36,827\nIf it will let me go back\nto my main storage page.\n\n435\n00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:37,727\nThere we go.\n\n436\n00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:41,017\nIn my main storage page for ITProTV files,\nyou've got all these tabs up here.\n\n437\n00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,267\nAnd it's not immediately obvious, but\n\n438\n00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,377\nthis little cloud is actually\nsomething you can click on.\n\n439\n00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:49,517\nAnd when you click on the cloud,\nit's what takes you to this welcome page.\n\n440\n00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,197\nSo if you've hidden your welcome page,\nthat'll get you here.\n\n441\n00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:57,130\nAnd in the welcome page, they've got\nGet the tools and Storage Explorers.\n\n442\n00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,740\nThe Storage Explorers,\n\n443\n00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,930\nthose are third party software packages\nyou can use to connect up to Azure.\n\n444\n00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,990\nAnd so they give you a list of software\npackages out there that you can use.\n\n445\n00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,700\nAnd they basically work like FTP clients.\n\n446\n00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,200\nThey connect up and\nyou can load files up there and\n\n447\n00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,730\nit's just no big deal at all, all right.\n\n448\n00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,830\nNow one of the most popular ones is this\nguy right here, Cloud Berry Explorer.\n\n449\n00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,690\nIt's free, and\nit works on Windows operating systems.\n\n450\n00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,480\nYou can fire it up, get connected Azure.\n\n451\n00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,640\nIt connects to other things too,\nlike Amazon S3 and stuff.\n\n452\n00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,730\nAnd you can throw your data up there.\n\n453\n00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,940\nIt works great.\n\n454\n00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,100\nBut I'm on a Mac, and Cloud Berry Explorer\ndoesn't work on a Mac.\n\n455\n00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,830\nAnd in fact, as you look down this list,\n\n456\n00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,800\nyou'll see a lot of these\ndon't work on a Mac.\n\n457\n00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,290\nSo I'm going to use another\nsoftware package that's actually\n\n458\n00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,820\nnot even in this list.\n\n459\n00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,430\nOn the Mac, there's a free\nsoftware package called Cyberduck.\n\n460\n00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,339\nAnd Cyberduck's actually available for\nWindows too.\n\n461\n00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:47,961\nSo if Windows, Mac, doesn't matter,\nyou can run Cyberduck.\n\n462\n00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:52,930\nAnd with Cyberduck we can connect\nright to Azure and copy our files.\n\n463\n00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,650\nBut there's two pieces\nof information we need.\n\n464\n00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,600\nIn order to log into our file account,\nwe need to know our account name and\n\n465\n00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,310\nour access keys.\n\n466\n00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,490\nNow this is an easy place to get confused.\n\n467\n00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,555\nWhen I think of my account name, my Azure\naccount name, I think of this right here,\n\n468\n00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,860\nDon@ITPro.TV, that's my account name.\n\n469\n00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,850\nWell that's my user account.\n\n470\n00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,140\nThey're referring to you storage account.\n\n471\n00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,040\nYour storage account has its own name.\n\n472\n00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,800\nAnd when we go to, like,\nour dashboard for our account, or\n\n473\n00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,300\nreally any of the screens here for\nour file account.\n\n474\n00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,480\nI'm in itprotvfiles.\n\n475\n00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,210\nAnd down at the bottom, you've got\nto Manage Access Keys, all right.\n\n476\n00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,380\nNow when you pull that up,\nit's gonna give you your access keys.\n\n477\n00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,350\nThis is a special username and password\nused just for accessing your file storage.\n\n478\n00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,770\nSo I can take this name,\nwhich mine is just itprotvfiles, and\n\n479\n00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,400\nthen I can take this primary access key,\nand I can use those as a name and\n\n480\n00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,360\na password to be able to connect in and\nmanage my file storage, all right.\n\n481\n00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,000\nSo I'm going to copy\nthis primary access key.\n\n482\n00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,372\nSo I just copied it to my clipboard, and\nI'm gonna use the username itprotvfiles,\n\n483\n00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:00,750\nand then that access key.\n\n484\n00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,080\nAll right,\nI'm going to fire up old Cyberduck.\n\n485\n00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,500\nAnd I'm gonna add in a new entry here.\n\n486\n00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,010\nAnd in the entry, I'm going to tell that\nI'm connecting to Windows Azure Storage.\n\n487\n00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,200\nFor the nickname, it's asking for\nmy storage account.\n\n488\n00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,760\nAnd mine is called itprotvfiles.\n\n489\n00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,210\nAnd see how it's kind of\nfilled in the rest for\n\n490\n00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,200\nme, itprotvfiles.blob.core.windows.net.\n\n491\n00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,110\nThat's right off of that web\npage we saw a moment ago.\n\n492\n00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,000\nAnd it's just got a little note here\nabout https, I'm gonna to remove that.\n\n493\n00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,300\nSo, I can see the URL here, and\n\n494\n00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,820\nI need to fill that actually\nin here on the server spot.\n\n495\n00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,550\nLet me get that punched in.\n\n496\n00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,780\nI was filling in the nickname.\n\n497\n00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,250\nI need to fill in the actual server.\n\n498\n00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,060\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,560\nAnd so it's correcting that URL for\nme, and I can look there and\n\n500\n00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,780\njust make sure that matches what you\nsaw in the dashboard for Azure Storage.\n\n501\n00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,450\nFor the username, well,\nmy username was itprotvfiles.\n\n502\n00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,010\nAll right.\n\n503\n00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,000\nSo I can specify that.\n\n504\n00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,860\nNow, it hasn't asked for my key yet.\n\n505\n00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,130\nIt'll ask for\nthat the first time that I connect.\n\n506\n00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,370\nSo, now I've got that defined.\n\n507\n00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,150\nHere's my entry for itprotvfiles.\n\n508\n00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,130\nI'm gonna double click on that.\n\n509\n00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,510\nAnd now it's asking for that key.\n\n510\n00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,680\nSo I'm gonna paste in that key.\n\n511\n00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,750\nIt's a nice, long one.\n\n512\n00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,420\nAnd I'm gonna go and log in.\n\n513\n00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,690\nNow I'm, actually, here,\nI won't save it to my keychain this time.\n\n514\n00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,270\nI'll go and get logged in.\n\n515\n00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,070\nIt's gonna reach out to that server.\n\n516\n00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,010\nAnd here I am, and I see private\ndocuments and public documents,\n\n517\n00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,930\nthose are those two containers.\n\n518\n00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,020\nRemember, I said think\nof them as like folders.\n\n519\n00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,470\nWell here they are, and I see them\nbasically like folders, empty folders, but\n\n520\n00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,110\nfolder none the less.\n\n521\n00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,000\nAnd from here, I can go and\n\n522\n00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,530\nI can take some files, I've got some\nfiles here on my desktop, I think.\n\n523\n00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,190\nLet's see, there we go.\n\n524\n00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,850\nI had a couple little images from\nthe Microsoft data centers, and\n\n525\n00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,030\nI can take these files, and I can just\ndrag them and drop them over here.\n\n526\n00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,150\nI'll throw them into\nthese public documents.\n\n527\n00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,620\nAnd it's gonna transfer those over.\n\n528\n00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,540\nAnd now I've got files inside\nof the public documents, right.\n\n529\n00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,750\nThere they are, datacenter1.png,\ndatacenter2.png.\n\n530\n00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,461\nThey're uploaded, and\nthey're in place, all right.\n\n531\n00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:02,017\nNow the cool part of all this\nis once they're up there,\n\n532\n00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:05,922\nbecause I put it in my Public Documents\nfolder, people can browse to that address.\n\n533\n00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,222\nAnd access those files.\n\n534\n00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:09,574\nAnd in the background Microsoft\nhas taken these and saying, oh,\n\n535\n00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,830\nI need to make these redundant.\n\n536\n00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,430\nIt's copying them to another server.\n\n537\n00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,570\nOr if I did like geo-redundancy,\nit's copying them to another data center.\n\n538\n00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,780\nI don't see that,\nthat's invisible to me, right?\n\n539\n00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,290\nIt's just loaded them up and\nmade them available.\n\n540\n00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,000\nSo if I go back to my Azure screen,\nand I go back to my containers, and I\n\n541\n00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,350\ntake like my public documents, there they\nare, I see datacenter-1 and datacenter-2.\n\n542\n00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,410\nAnd it gives me the URL that I\ncan distribute to my clients, or\n\n543\n00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,300\nuse on my website, or wherever.\n\n544\n00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,350\nIf I'm using the API, I can query and\nget this stuff automatically.\n\n545\n00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,895\nBut now I can get this out, and\nanybody who browses to that address,\n\n546\n00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:50,280\nITProTVfiles.blob.core.windows.net/public-\ndocuments/datacenter-1.png.\n\n547\n00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,740\nWhen they browse to it,\nthere's that image.\n\n548\n00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,620\nOr if they browse to datacenter-2,\nthere's that image.\n\n549\n00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,600\nI made those public, so they're there.\n\n550\n00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,160\nThey're ready and\nthey're waiting for us, right?\n\n551\n00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,210\nAnd Microsoft, they've got just a little\nbit of bandwidth over there, right?\n\n552\n00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,933\nTons of bandwidth compared to us, so\nI can have five people download this or\n\n553\n00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:15,740\nI could have five million people download\nthis and Microsoft's got it covered.\n\n554\n00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,400\nWe just pay for\nthe bandwidth that we use, right?\n\n555\n00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,690\nWith Azure storage,\nthat's what you pay for.\n\n556\n00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,620\nYou pay a little bit for\nthe storage itself,\n\n557\n00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,190\nso keeping the data on the hard drive,\nbut it's like this negligible fee.\n\n558\n00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,920\nAnd then after that you pay for\n\n559\n00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,270\nthe bandwidth of sending\nit out to your customers.\n\n560\n00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,240\nBut they've got the capacity\nto handle that, and\n\n561\n00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,450\nwe're leveraging that with Azure storage.\n\n562\n00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,270\n>> Now Don, what would be the advantage or\ndisadvantage or\n\n563\n00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,900\ndifference or whatever you want to call it\n>> between doing something like this or\n\n564\n00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,880\njust spinning up a virtual server and\nmaking a file server?\n\n565\n00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,500\n>> So you certainly could do that, right?\n\n566\n00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,530\nI can spin up a Windows box or\na Linux box, make my own file server.\n\n567\n00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,200\nRight?\n\n568\n00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,890\nBut then I'm responsible for\nmaintaining the operating system.\n\n569\n00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,360\nI gotta do patches and updates.\n\n570\n00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,478\nI've got to handle my own redundancy.\n\n571\n00:25:57,478 --> 00:26:00,460\nIf I wanna copy between zones or whatever\nI've got to spin up a server in another\n\n572\n00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,730\nzone or replicate it, with this,\nMicrosoft does it all for me, right?\n\n573\n00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,430\nAnd the other thing is,\nwhen I spin up that server,\n\n574\n00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,920\nI've got a provisional hard\ndrive that's a certain size.\n\n575\n00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,042\nSo I might have five gigs of files but\nI go ahead and\n\n576\n00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:17,210\nprovision a 64 gig hard drive because\nI know I'm gonna add more later on.\n\n577\n00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,710\nWell I'm paying for that 64 gigs today.\n\n578\n00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,210\nBut if I use the Azure File Service,\nI just pay for the files that I upload.\n\n579\n00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,385\nIf I'm only using five gigs,\nI only use five gigs.\n\n580\n00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,260\nBut there's no limit.\n\n581\n00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,350\nI can add as much as I want to it, and\n\n582\n00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,900\nI never have to worry about\nresizing a hard disk, right?\n\n583\n00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,555\nThat's the stuff that we get when\nwe use the Azure File Service.\n\n584\n00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:34,380\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n585\n00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,750\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n586\n00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,580\nAll right, well, Don, it sounds like this\nis definitely some beneficial stuff that\n\n587\n00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,570\nwe might wanna use, or\nanybody might wanna use for that matter.\n\n588\n00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,720\nVery awesome.\n\n589\n00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,730\nAnything else we can cover on this?\n\n590\n00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,286\n>> Yeah, I mean, the thing of it is,\nthere's a lot more of the back end as far\n\n591\n00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,650\nas API access, and tables, and\nall that other good stuff.\n\n592\n00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,300\nBut as far as basic services inside of\nAzure storage, that's pretty much it.\n\n593\n00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,740\nSo those are the things we need to know.\n\n594\n00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,350\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n595\n00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,080\nI hope you guys out there watching\nthis learned a lot about this service.\n\n596\n00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,530\nDefinitely beneficial for you.\n\n597\n00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,050\nThat being said, we've come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n598\n00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,420\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n599\n00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,140\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n600\n00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,505\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:15,520\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,210\nI'll be your host, Daniel Laury.\n\n5\n00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,130\nHere with me today, is Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,280\nHow you doing today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,110\n>> I am doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,670\nYou know today,\n\n9\n00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,960\nwe're gonna be jumping into the World\nof Hosted Databases on Microsoft Azure.\n\n10\n00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,830\nWhich is a pretty good time,\nif I say so myself.\n\n11\n00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,460\n>> Yeah, Databases.\n\n12\n00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,920\nWho doesn't like a good database?\n\n13\n00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,950\nThey hold information.\n\n14\n00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,900\nWe've got the tables.\n\n15\n00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,660\nWe've got lots of interesting stuff there.\n\n16\n00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,015\nAnd the great thing is, their very\nlow in resource intensity, right Don?\n\n17\n00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, Databases,\n\n18\n00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,620\nthere's a couple of things about them\nthat make them really, really sensitive.\n\n19\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,360\nAnd first off, is that companies have\na tendency to depend on their databases.\n\n20\n00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,910\nSo when you got all your information\njammed in a database that your company\n\n21\n00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,080\nrequires to query and it goes offline\n>> Well,\n\n22\n00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,010\nthat can put hundreds, thousands of\npeople, where they're not able to work,\n\n23\n00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,390\ncuz they can't get at the data,\nso they're really important.\n\n24\n00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,330\nOr maybe it's your sales database,\nand all your sales are going into it.\n\n25\n00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,960\nIf you lose that database,\nyou're losing money.\n\n26\n00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,970\nSo that's a big deal.\n\n27\n00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,570\nSecond thing is,\ndatabases can be fairly complex to set-up.\n\n28\n00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,920\nNow, they can be really easy,\nyou can run through the wizard,\n\n29\n00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,750\naccept the defaults and that's that.\n\n30\n00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,330\nBut if you ever set up\nyour own database server,\n\n31\n00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,390\nyou'll know that tuning\nthe database is really challenging.\n\n32\n00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,880\nAnd it stems from all sorts\nof hardware requirements,.\n\n33\n00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,260\nDisk drive arrangements,\nand things like that.\n\n34\n00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,150\nIt is pretty challenging.\n\n35\n00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,210\nWith Windows Azure,\nthey take away all that risk from us.\n\n36\n00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,740\nThey take it.\n\n37\n00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,920\nAnd they deal with it.\n\n38\n00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,250\nSo, they tune the Sequel Server Forest.\n\n39\n00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,440\nThey build the disk arrays and alignments.\n\n40\n00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,270\nAnd they set all that stuff up for us.\n\n41\n00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,250\nAll we do is say, hey,\ngive me a database, and they do.\n\n42\n00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,270\nThey give you that database.\n\n43\n00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,670\nAnd now you're off and running.\n\n44\n00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,780\nThat makes life a heck of a lot easier.\n\n45\n00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,250\nAll right.\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n46\n00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,320\nget started with this one.\n\n47\n00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,000\nIf I need a Microsoft SQL\ndatabase in my environment.\n\n48\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,090\nThere's actually two different\nways I can deploy it in Azure.\n\n49\n00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,010\nAll right.\n\n50\n00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,260\nOne way gives me a lot of control but\nvery little support.\n\n51\n00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,120\nAnd the other way gives me a ton of\nsupport, but very little control.\n\n52\n00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,530\nThe choice I have to make is whether\nI want to support the SQL Server, or\n\n53\n00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,470\nif I want Microsoft to do for me.\n\n54\n00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,390\nThe reality is, Microsoft being\nthe company that created Microsoft SQL\n\n55\n00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,440\nhas a better understanding\nof how that server runs.\n\n56\n00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640\nAnd has some of the best employees\nin the world for supporting it.\n\n57\n00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,090\nWe typically want to use them, right,\nits kind of the whole point of the cloud.\n\n58\n00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,570\nSo for that, we're going to\nuse the Azure Hosted Database.\n\n59\n00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,890\nBut if I want full control.\n\n60\n00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,500\nIf I want to manage where\nthe transaction logs reside.\n\n61\n00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,130\nAnd I want to manage all the nitty,\ngritty details then, the better thing for\n\n62\n00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,170\nme to do is just go in,\ncreate a regular VM.\n\n63\n00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,550\nAnd go to the server gallery.\n\n64\n00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,540\nAnd there's server gallery entries\nin there that all ready have\n\n65\n00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,550\nSQL Server attached to them.\n\n66\n00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,950\nYou just deploy them and off you go.\n\n67\n00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,890\nBut you support that, not Microsoft.\n\n68\n00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,270\nSo you have to deal with the tuning and\nthe arrangements.\n\n69\n00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,630\nAnd all the other things.\n\n70\n00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,390\nMicrosoft doesn't deal with it for you.\n\n71\n00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,650\nBut for us, we're gonna take\na look at the hosted solution.\n\n72\n00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,670\nBecause that's really, really where\nyour money's worth out of the cloud.\n\n73\n00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,240\nSo I'm going to jump\ninto my Azure panel here.\n\n74\n00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,730\nAnd in the Azure panel,\n\n75\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,270\nyou'll see all your various\nservers over here on the left.\n\n76\n00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,220\nAnd if it's as we kind of look down,\nyou'll find SQL Databases, right there.\n\n77\n00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,570\nAnd I don't currently have any,\nso when I come in here,\n\n78\n00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,410\nits just gonna have the option\nto create a SQL Database.\n\n79\n00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,660\nSo let's walk through that process of\ncreating a SQL Database in the cloud.\n\n80\n00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,530\nNow notice it saying, I want to\ncreate a SQL Database not a server.\n\n81\n00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,790\nIt's not asking about the underlying\noperating system or even SQL itself.\n\n82\n00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,170\nIt's asking about the database.\n\n83\n00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,440\nYou can have more than one database\nstored on the same server.\n\n84\n00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,770\nBut the challenge with doing that is,\n\n85\n00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,440\nwe have to worry about contention for\nresources.\n\n86\n00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,240\nWell, not in the Cloud.\n\n87\n00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,310\nAgain, Microsoft is gonna take\ncare of a lot of that for us.\n\n88\n00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,450\nAnd we'll see it as we move through this.\n\n89\n00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,490\nSo I'll hit, Create a SQL database.\n\n90\n00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,880\nNow it's gonna start asking for questions.\n\n91\n00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,700\nNow, the first thing it asks us for\nthe database server name.\n\n92\n00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,640\nSorry, let me clarify that.\n\n93\n00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,420\nIt's asking for the Database Name,\nnot the Database Server Name.\n\n94\n00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,200\nSo I want my database to be sales DB,\nright, this is gonna be my sale database.\n\n95\n00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,010\nAll of every time we sell something,\n\n96\n00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,680\nthe receipts are gonna go\nright here in this database.\n\n97\n00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,380\nAnd it's asking for\nwhat subscription is attached to.\n\n98\n00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,540\nYou will need a Microsoft SQL License.\n\n99\n00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,520\nMine's going to come out of\nmy biz spark subscription.\n\n100\n00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,130\nYou might have an Enterprise Agreement.\n\n101\n00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,120\nOr whatever it is, that you signed up for\nWindows Azure with, that'll show up here.\n\n102\n00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,910\nThen comes the tricky part.\n\n103\n00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,660\nMicrosoft is going to take care\nof tuning this server, but\n\n104\n00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,860\nthey don't know how busy it's gonna be.\n\n105\n00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,400\nThey don't know how much\ndata it's gonna push.\n\n106\n00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,140\nOnly you know that, you know your data.\n\n107\n00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,100\nSo you know how much it's\ngoing to be hit on the system.\n\n108\n00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,420\nAnd so, it's asking us to pick\nbetween Three Service Tiers.\n\n109\n00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,190\nBasic.\nStandard..\n\n110\n00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,690\nPremium.\n\n111\n00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,510\nThere's two others but\nsee how these are retired tiers,\n\n112\n00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,930\nyou're not supposed to use those anymore.\n\n113\n00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,590\nSo if this is a new deployment,\njust ignore those two.\n\n114\n00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,500\nSo Basic, Standard, and Premium.\n\n115\n00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,340\nAnd as I choose these, what you'll notice\nis this performance level is what changes.\n\n116\n00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,150\nThe performance level is bumping from\n5 DTUs to 10 DTUs to 100 DTUs for\n\n117\n00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,190\nthe default.\n\n118\n00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,190\nAnd down here the size.\n\n119\n00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,190\nUnder premium,\nI get up to a 500 gigabyte database.\n\n120\n00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,370\nUnder standard, I get 250 gigs.\n\n121\n00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,140\nAnd other basic, I get 2 gigs.\n\n122\n00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,890\nSo, I'm basically picking\nthe size of my database\n\n123\n00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,800\nas far as raw storage and\nas far as performance.\n\n124\n00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,820\nNow for performance,\nthey're talking about DTU's.\n\n125\n00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,840\nWhat the heck is a DTU?\n\n126\n00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,330\nWell, it's a Data Throughput Unit.\n\n127\n00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,290\nAnd the Data Throughput Unit is\narbitrary thing that Microsoft invented.\n\n128\n00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,070\nNow normally.\n\n129\n00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,960\n>> That clears it up.\n\n130\n00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> Normally that's bad.\n\n131\n00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,530\nBut in this case,\nit's actually a good thing.\n\n132\n00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,180\nWhen it comes to measuring a database,\nyour primary concern is,\n\n133\n00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,980\nwell different databases\nhave different needs.\n\n134\n00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,200\nIf you have an OLAP Database, Online\nAnalysis Processing, RAM, you need RAM.\n\n135\n00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,910\nBut if you have a Transactional Database,\n\n136\n00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,998\nan Online Transactional Processing,\nOLTP, there we go, database.\n\n137\n00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,910\nThen, this [INAUDIBLE]\nis your big concern.\n\n138\n00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,670\nSo, how do you compare one to the other,\nand all that?\n\n139\n00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,770\nSo Microsoft made this DTU calculation.\n\n140\n00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,950\nAnd it's kind of a combination of\nthose various characteristics.\n\n141\n00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,100\nAnd the best way to really see\nthat is,if I, let me pull up this.\n\n142\n00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,840\nThis is Microsoft's page for\nthe Azure SQL Database service tiers.\n\n143\n00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,920\nAnd they have a great table in here,\nif we can scroll down and find it.\n\n144\n00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,300\nThis guy, right here.\n\n145\n00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,480\nAnd it's talking about DTUs.\n\n146\n00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,860\nSo here's that basic 5 DTU,\nor 10 DTUs, 50, 100,\n\n147\n00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,960\nall the way up to a 1,000 DTUs depending\non the of level server that we pick.\n\n148\n00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,760\nAnd then, it gives us an idea of\nwhat that can actually handle,\n\n149\n00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,800\nMaximum Concurrent Requests.\n\n150\n00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,420\nMaximum Concurrent Logins.\n\n151\n00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,970\nMaximum Sessions.\n\n152\n00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,740\nBenchmark Transaction Rate.\n\n153\n00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,180\nAnd Predictability.\n\n154\n00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,170\nOkay, the main one that\nwe really care about,\n\n155\n00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,910\nfor most of us,\nis Benchmark Transaction Rate.\n\n156\n00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,610\nOkay, how many transactions are you\nthrowing at the server per hour?\n\n157\n00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,800\nAnd so, it's got them listed\nhere per minute or per second.\n\n158\n00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,670\nSo you'll see, this guy can do\n16,600 transactions per hour.\n\n159\n00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,688\nBut this guy can only do 5,100.\n\n160\n00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,640\nWell, it's 5,100 per minute.\n\n161\n00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,400\nSo multiply by that by 60,\nit becomes a much, much larger number.\n\n162\n00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,900\nOr the biggest one,\n735 transactions per second.\n\n163\n00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,460\nThat one can handle tons and\ntons of transactions.\n\n164\n00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,190\nWell, how many transactions\nare you gonna handle?\n\n165\n00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,140\nMicrosoft doesn't know, it's up to you.\n\n166\n00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,050\nFortunately, if you pick wrong,\nit's easy to change this after the fact.\n\n167\n00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,050\nYou can bump it up.\n\n168\n00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,660\nYou monitor your service performance.\n\n169\n00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,170\nAnd you increase the load as you go.\n\n170\n00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,230\nThis same article, if you continue\non starts talking about that,\n\n171\n00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,400\nlike how to monitor that performance and\ntell when you need to increase.\n\n172\n00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,710\nBut this is how we kind of\nchoose that basic instant size,\n\n173\n00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,750\nwhen we go to launch that single database.\n\n174\n00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,270\nUnder predictability, that's saying,\n\n175\n00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,990\nam I always gonna get the same level\nof performance out of the server?\n\n176\n00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,902\nThe lower end servers Microsoft hosts,\nthose on lower end equipment.\n\n177\n00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:51,659\nEquipment that's got a lot more traffic\non it than the higher end servers.\n\n178\n00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,566\nAnd so, you'll see down here where these\nguys have the best predictability.\n\n179\n00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:59,063\nWell, you pay more for\nthem and in exchange for\n\n180\n00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:03,890\nthat Microsoft ensures that you get the\nhighest level of access to those servers.\n\n181\n00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,910\nBut this is kind of how we make that\ndecision and it comes down to a DTU size,\n\n182\n00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,685\nand we pick that based on the type\nof server that we're picking.\n\n183\n00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:16,245\nSo that's really what it's asking\nright here when we're saying basic,\n\n184\n00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,085\nstandard and premium.\n\n185\n00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,745\nAnd then in the side of those I've\ngot the performance level and\n\n186\n00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,425\nI can choose between those.\n\n187\n00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:26,340\nSo when I choose standard I can only\npick between 10 and a 100 DTUs.\n\n188\n00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,513\nWhen I go to premium,\nI can pick between 100 and 800 DTUs,\n\n189\n00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:36,024\nsignificantly larger and when I go down to\nbasic you got that whole 5 whopping DTUs.\n\n190\n00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,640\nSo I'll just do a standard server for now.\n\n191\n00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,070\nAll right?\n\n192\n00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,850\nThen as we kind of continue\nlooking down here,\n\n193\n00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,030\nyou've got your collations and\nyour SQL server.\n\n194\n00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,960\nNow, collation is important.\n\n195\n00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,595\nCollation is how the data is going\nto be sorted in the database.\n\n196\n00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,890\nIf you're not a DBA,\nif you're not a database administrator,\n\n197\n00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,000\nthe easiest way to explain this is kind\nof like sorting something alphabetically.\n\n198\n00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,920\nSo Daniel,\n\n199\n00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,740\nif I gave you a list of names and I said\nI need you to sort this alphabetically.\n\n200\n00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,230\nWhat would come first?\n\n201\n00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,954\n>> A.\n>> A, and what would be last?\n\n202\n00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:08,648\n>> Z.\n\n203\n00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,060\n>> That's what we think of, right?\n\n204\n00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,540\nBut what if there's an entry\nnode that starts with a number?\n\n205\n00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,620\n>> Then-\n>> Where's that go?\n\n206\n00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,770\n>> That's a good question.\n\n207\n00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,950\nSome people put it at the front\nsome people put it at the end.\n\n208\n00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,840\nWherever they think numbers go.\n\n209\n00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,770\n>> What if something starts\nwith an exclamation point, and\n\n210\n00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,720\nsomething else starts with an at symbol?\n\n211\n00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,025\n>> Now, my brain is starting to smoke.\n\n212\n00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,203\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n213\n00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:30,023\nwell those are things that we don't\ncare about as humans, like whatever,\n\n214\n00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:30,980\nI don't care.\n\n215\n00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,390\nBut as the database it's got to know that,\nright?\n\n216\n00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,800\nIt's gotta know what\ncharacters are acceptable.\n\n217\n00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,710\nWhat characters are represented and\nwhat sort of order, and all of this stuff.\n\n218\n00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,980\nAnd it's the collation that sets that.\n\n219\n00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,310\nThis is something that can't be changed,\nall right?\n\n220\n00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,240\nIf you need to change your collation\nyou gotta create a new database\n\n221\n00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,570\nwith the right collation,\nexport your data and import it, right?\n\n222\n00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,480\nSo it's important the right\ncollation set first.\n\n223\n00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,522\nNow, if you're here in the United States.\n\n224\n00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:56,730\nSQL Latin1 general,\n\n225\n00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,830\nthat's the default that's what most\nof us want, you leave it be, right?\n\n226\n00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,730\nBut if you're importing data\nfrom a database that you've got\n\n227\n00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,160\nin your own local enterprise or Oracle or\nif you're international, right?\n\n228\n00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720\nIf you're in Europe,\nChina, Asia, or wherever.\n\n229\n00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,840\nThen you might use a different collation\nand so it's important to hit that drop\n\n230\n00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,110\ndown box and pick and\nyou'll see there are tons of them.\n\n231\n00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,672\nAnd we've got Croatian, Czech, Danish,\n\n232\n00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:23,212\nall these different ones in here,\nPolish, Scandinavian.\n\n233\n00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:26,330\nAnd it's because those languages,\nthey've got different characters.\n\n234\n00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,160\nCharacters there aren't in our Western\na through z alphabet type thing.\n\n235\n00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,920\nThey've got all sorts of different stuff,\nso\n\n236\n00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,700\nthey've got to have collation set for\nthat.\n\n237\n00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,630\nAnd there's all sorts of\nvariations inside of that.\n\n238\n00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,360\nLook at wow,\n\n239\n00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,150\nI never realized how many Vietnamese\ncollations there are, holy moly.\n\n240\n00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,820\n>> Wow.\n>> So\n\n241\n00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,945\nI have no idea what any of those are.\n\n242\n00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you gotta pick\n\n243\n00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,440\nthe one that's appropriate\nto what you need.\n\n244\n00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,750\nHopefully, if you're in Vietnam\nyou do know what those are.\n\n245\n00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,570\nSo that is an important\none to choose correctly.\n\n246\n00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,460\nAnd with all these options,\nif you don't know enough about it,\n\n247\n00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,300\nyou can float over the question mark and\nit'll give you a little explanation there.\n\n248\n00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,390\nAnd then at the end as we choose\nthe server and I don't have any servers\n\n249\n00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,100\ncreated yet, so the only option I\nhave is new SQL database server.\n\n250\n00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,040\nNow, unlike when I create a VM,\nnormally this is gonna create a VM for\n\n251\n00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,120\nme and I'm not gonna see it.\n\n252\n00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,590\nIt's not gonna show up in my VM\ninstances because it's a managed VM.\n\n253\n00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,310\nMicrosoft is gonna manage that for\nme and take care of that.\n\n254\n00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,910\nSo there will be a VM running in\nthe background that's where your charge\n\n255\n00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,810\ncomes from on that's what\nyou gotta pay the bill for.\n\n256\n00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,230\nBut I don't have to deal with it so\nthat's that's kind of nice.\n\n257\n00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,730\nOkay, so those are some of the solutions\nthat we have to choose there.\n\n258\n00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,510\nAnd then we hit next,\nit asked us for a SQL log in, right.\n\n259\n00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,580\nWe need to create at least one account so\nwe can reach in and manage the system.\n\n260\n00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,350\nSo I'll create an account for\nme and I'll punch in a password.\n\n261\n00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,250\nOnce you're connected to the system\nyou can create as many other accounts\n\n262\n00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,880\nas you want.\n\n263\n00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,310\nThis is just the initial one to get set.\n\n264\n00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,960\nAnd I don't think I'll put this in\nJapan today, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n265\n00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,470\nput this in East US.\n\n266\n00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,950\nAnd then we've got allow Windows Azure\nservices to access this server.\n\n267\n00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,760\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,580\nDo I want to allow all the other\nAzure products that I have running\n\n269\n00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,360\nto access this database server?\n\n270\n00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,510\nThat's the default that assumes\nthat we want to support those\n\n271\n00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,290\napps, but I might not.\n\n272\n00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,861\nI might want this to be protected.\n\n273\n00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,655\nMaybe this is gonna be a private database\nserver for something that I don't want\n\n274\n00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,075\nthe other Azure services to have\naccess to, so I can turn that off.\n\n275\n00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:26,095\nAnd then we also have enable the latest\nSQL database update version 12.\n\n276\n00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:29,677\nIt's gonna go version 12 by default,\nthat's what we want.\n\n277\n00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:30,407\nRight?\n\n278\n00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:34,637\nBut if you want to do an older version or\nwhatever you can unchecked that and\n\n279\n00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:38,157\nit'll go with just version 11,\nand you create the database.\n\n280\n00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,467\nYou can always update that\nlater if you need to, but\n\n281\n00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,203\ntypically we want that version 12.\n\n282\n00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:45,227\nAll right, I'll go ahead and\nhit my check mark to create that.\n\n283\n00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,917\nAnd now,\nit's going to provision that database.\n\n284\n00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:50,687\nNow, what it's actually doing in\nthe background, it's creating a VM.\n\n285\n00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,960\nIt's spinning up a server\nto support this database.\n\n286\n00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,966\nAnd once the server is up, a Windows\nserver running Microsoft SQL fully\n\n287\n00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:02,124\ninstalled and configured,\nit's then gonna create the sales.db on it.\n\n288\n00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:05,740\nAnd then it's gonna create a user account,\ndpezet, in that sales.db.\n\n289\n00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,700\nAnd I'll be a sys admin so\nI'll be able to connect to that database.\n\n290\n00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,390\nAnd start to work with it.\n\n291\n00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,230\nThe first time you do this it's gonna take\na little while cuz it's got to spin up\n\n292\n00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,510\nthat new server right, so\nit says it right there, new server.\n\n293\n00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,510\nSo I have to wait as I add\nmore databases though,\n\n294\n00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,010\nI can choose to add them\nto that same server.\n\n295\n00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,420\nWhen we do that,\nthey'll add much more quickly.\n\n296\n00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,518\nNow, it's just creating a quick\ndatabase on the same server,\n\n297\n00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,341\nno big deal there at all, all right.\n\n298\n00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:33,437\nNow, it's busy creating\nthat database server and\n\n299\n00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,035\nwe can kind of watch\nthat status down here.\n\n300\n00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:39,020\nThere was a little warning messages\njust kinda came and went, but\n\n301\n00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,940\nI can see it's created a server.\n\n302\n00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,320\nIt gave the server a nice\neasy to remember name.\n\n303\n00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,027\nMine is, can barely read that,\nsvqc8 F60CL.\n\n304\n00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,072\n>> That makes sense.\n\n305\n00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,475\n>> It's a random number, right?\n\n306\n00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:51,825\nOr a random name.\n\n307\n00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,445\nThat's because Microsoft is\nmanaging the server not us.\n\n308\n00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,655\nSo we don't really need a name for\nthe server.\n\n309\n00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,795\nNow, we will need an address to be able\nto connect to it to access the database.\n\n310\n00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,445\nWe'll see that in a minute.\n\n311\n00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:02,235\nAll right?\n\n312\n00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,185\nBut it's up and running.\n\n313\n00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:08,080\nIf I wanna start creating other databases\nI can and they'll get attached to it.\n\n314\n00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,590\nNow, that server is managed.\n\n315\n00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,340\nIf I go up here to my virtual machines,\nit's not on the list.\n\n316\n00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,128\nIt doesn't just affect if I go to all I\ndon't look at all of my stuff it's not\n\n317\n00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:19,666\nthere.\n\n318\n00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,060\nIt's not a list right.\n\n319\n00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,570\nIt's not my VM.\n\n320\n00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,670\nIt's the Azure VM, right?\n\n321\n00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,440\nIt's managed, they're controlling it.\n\n322\n00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,920\nThat's why we don't see it here.\n\n323\n00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,890\nIf we go in our SQL databases and we look\nat that server, we click on that hot link,\n\n324\n00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,940\nit tells us a little bit about the server,\nbut there's only so much we can do here.\n\n325\n00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,990\nCreate databases, right?\n\n326\n00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,340\nThat's the way you do,\ncreate database on it.\n\n327\n00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,670\nAnd you can look at its dashboard, and\nyou can see some basic information on it.\n\n328\n00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,660\nBut when you normally look at a VM,\nyou have an entry over here that tells you\n\n329\n00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,960\nthe RDP thumbprint or fingerprint so that\nyou can be able to remote desktop into it.\n\n330\n00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,680\nWe don't see that here, right?\n\n331\n00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,500\nI'm not allowed to get to that.\n\n332\n00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,420\nI can go into my configure screen and\n\n333\n00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,160\nlook at who's allowed to connect\nwhich actually I need to set that up.\n\n334\n00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,910\nBut I don't have that ability to\nopen up the RDP port on it, right.\n\n335\n00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,610\nSo it's not a normal server in\nthe sense that we can't control it.\n\n336\n00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,390\nAll right, now once that server is up\nthough there is some important stuff that\n\n337\n00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,520\nwe need to do.\n\n338\n00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,925\nWe need to control who is allowed\nto connect to this thing.\n\n339\n00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,020\nSQL database is really sensitive, right.\n\n340\n00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,470\nThat's data that your company requires.\n\n341\n00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,164\nIf a hacker gets in your system,\nthey look for databases first, right.\n\n342\n00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,102\nThat's where the good stuff is.\n\n343\n00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:26,126\n>> Credit cards.\n\n344\n00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:26,830\n>> Credit cards.\n\n345\n00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Credit cards,\n\n346\n00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,399\nmailing in email addresses,\nsocial security numbers,\n\n347\n00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,937\nany kind of, they call it personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n348\n00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,310\nWrite that PI, that's not right.\n\n349\n00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,610\nPersonally identifiable data,\nPID, there we go.\n\n350\n00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,336\n>> PID.\n>> That's what they're looking for, and\n\n351\n00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:42,850\nit's normally in databases.\n\n352\n00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,840\nSo we really need to protect these.\n\n353\n00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,213\nSo by default not a lot of\npeople can get into it.\n\n354\n00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,885\nIf I go into the Server Settings and\nI go to Configure.\n\n355\n00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:55,360\nI can see allowed IP addresses and\nthere's nobody in the list.\n\n356\n00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,710\nAnd then down here, allowed services,\n\n357\n00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,865\nI can see where the Windows Azure\nservices are allowed, right?\n\n358\n00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,570\nWe saw that in the wizard.\n\n359\n00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,140\nI can turn that off here if I\ndidn't want them to connect.\n\n360\n00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,940\nBut at a minimum I need to add my own IP,\nand they've already looked that up.\n\n361\n00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,650\nThey're saying, hey Don, your laptop\nis showing as being on this IP.\n\n362\n00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,180\nSo you can go and\nadd that to the group if you want.\n\n363\n00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,140\nNow there we go.\n\n364\n00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,030\nRight, and so I know,\nthat that's actually our studio IP.\n\n365\n00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,820\nSo I might call that\nthe ITproTV studio IP.\n\n366\n00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,780\nSo I'm gonna authorize\nthat IP address right.\n\n367\n00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,870\nMaybe it's a range of IPs.\n\n368\n00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,330\nI could put the start in,\nput my home one, you put this and\n\n369\n00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,980\nthis is dictating who's allowed\nto even connect to the server.\n\n370\n00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,230\nYou need to be in this list and\nyou need to have a valid user name and\n\n371\n00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,870\npassword to connect.\n\n372\n00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,000\nIf you don't have those two\nthings then you can't connect.\n\n373\n00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,680\nSo I'll set those values.\n\n374\n00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,410\nSo now I'm in the approved list and\neverybody's happy, right?\n\n375\n00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,580\nLet's go see if this\nthing's done provisioning.\n\n376\n00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,820\nIf I jump back out, oops.\n\n377\n00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,790\nLet's see, it's got me at the list.\n\n378\n00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,830\nOh, I'm forgetting something important.\n\n379\n00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,530\nI got a little save button down here at\nthe bottom I probably need to hit that so\n\n380\n00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,630\nI'll go ahead and hit save so\nit's gonna save that entry so\n\n381\n00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,750\nI'll be allowed to access\nmy database there we go.\n\n382\n00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,210\nNow if I go back to my databases,\nI can see sales DB\n\n383\n00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,160\nits online, its fired up,\nthe server's there, its happy,\n\n384\n00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,950\nI could add more databases if I need to,\nand when I go to create a new database.\n\n385\n00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,790\nSo here I'm just doing a new database.\n\n386\n00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,550\nI can do a quick create or custom create,\ni've got all sorts of options here.\n\n387\n00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,320\nBut when I create a database,\nmaybe this is my marketing database.\n\n388\n00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,220\nSo I'll create a marketing DB and\n\n389\n00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,080\nnow I can pick a server and there is\nthat server that we just made, right?\n\n390\n00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,070\nSo it shows up right there.\n\n391\n00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,630\nI can choose it or\ncan make it its own dedicated SQL server.\n\n392\n00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,360\nMaybe I want it to be in\na different region so\n\n393\n00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,480\nI can pick a server that's\nin a different region.\n\n394\n00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,810\nSo I'll pick this one though,\nI'll create that database and\n\n395\n00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,530\nthere it goes and this will happen a lot\nfaster because the server is already up,\n\n396\n00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,590\nit's already running.\n\n397\n00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,360\nIt's just going to make that database and\nstick it on there.\n\n398\n00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,970\nThe database is empty so\nthat'll be done shortly.\n\n399\n00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,770\n>> Now Don, as you create databases.\n\n400\n00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,560\nI've got the one that we just created and\nwe need to create maybe two or\n\n401\n00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,250\nthree more, does it put it on the same\nserver that they are managing or\n\n402\n00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,970\ndo they spin up a new instance\nof a server every time?\n\n403\n00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,640\n>> Well, so it's a good question and\nit centers around utilization, right?\n\n404\n00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,980\nIf these are really busy databases,\n\n405\n00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,220\nI might not want them to\nshare the same server, right?\n\n406\n00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,400\nI might want them to be split up and\nseparate.\n\n407\n00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,690\nWhen you create these databases,\nyou kind of have to pick what\n\n408\n00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,740\nis gonna happen as far as like\nutilization and all that.\n\n409\n00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,900\nIf you go under servers and\nyou pull up that server,\n\n410\n00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,780\nin its dashboard, it'll actually show\nhow many DTUs that server can handle.\n\n411\n00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,120\nThis server can handle 2,000 DTUs.\n\n412\n00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,770\nI've stuck two databases on it right now,\nand because of the sizes that I picked for\n\n413\n00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,600\nthem, each one had 10 DTUs,\nso I'm at 20 DTUs.\n\n414\n00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,930\nSo now I've got a good way to measure\nhow much utilization is still available\n\n415\n00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,920\non that server.\n\n416\n00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,460\nSo if I need another database,\nyeah I can stick around in here,\n\n417\n00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,890\nthere's plenty of utilization.\n\n418\n00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,390\nBut if it's a massive database,\nthen it might eat up what's left and\n\n419\n00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,460\nI need to go and\nspin up something different, right?\n\n420\n00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,030\nSo you got to be careful with that, you\ngot to make sure you respect things right,\n\n421\n00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,830\nbut it's easy to see it right\nhere in the server dashboards.\n\n422\n00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,620\nAll right, you know there's something else\nthat I should have mentioned, that I did.\n\n423\n00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,065\nWhen I made those databases,\nnotice over here.\n\n424\n00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,306\nEdition, Standard S0.\n\n425\n00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:16,350\nThat's that size that we picked.\n\n426\n00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,770\nThat's where that DTU value\nis coming from right there.\n\n427\n00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,780\nSo I see that value, it's right there.\n\n428\n00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,830\nThat's the information on that sales DB.\n\n429\n00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,720\nAnd if I click on it and\ncome in here to like the dashboard,\n\n430\n00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,320\nI can see information on it specifically\nas far as how much space it's used, and\n\n431\n00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320\ninformation on what's going on with it.\n\n432\n00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,520\nI can go to the scale tab and\nhere's where I can change it.\n\n433\n00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,550\nSo if I need to bump that up to 20 DTUs or\nwhatever.\n\n434\n00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,360\nI can do that, I can even bump that\nsize up or down based on my needs.\n\n435\n00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,110\nAssuming I've got available room,\nit defaults to the max so\n\n436\n00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,720\nwe don't normally have to mess with that.\n\n437\n00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,580\nBut you can adjust these\nvalues right here.\n\n438\n00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,950\nAnd it tells me right here,\n\n439\n00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,470\nhere is the amount of DTUs that\nI've got available on that server.\n\n440\n00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,030\nSo this is the server I'm on.\n\n441\n00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,560\nHere's what I've got left, so\neasy to change the stuff after the fact.\n\n442\n00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,270\nAnd then come down save it, and\nnow it's going to bump that up\n\n443\n00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,850\nfrom 10 DTUs to 20 DTUs,\nand it's got more capacity.\n\n444\n00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,680\nAll right.\n\n445\n00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,020\nNow the only thing left is for\nme to use the database.\n\n446\n00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,260\nI need to get connected.\n\n447\n00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,770\nWell, I approved my IP address,\nI've got a user name and\n\n448\n00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,060\na password, I just need this to fire up\nmy SQL Management Studio and connect.\n\n449\n00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,970\nSo I'm gonna jump over\nto a Windows box here.\n\n450\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,430\nOop, actually I do need one other thing.\n\n451\n00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,960\nIf I'm gonna connect to this database I\nprobably need to know the server address,\n\n452\n00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,200\nthat usually helps.\n\n453\n00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480\nSo I'm gonna go back out here to SQL\ndatabases, and I'll go to servers and\n\n454\n00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,160\nI'm gonna click on my server,\nand on the server's dashboard\n\n455\n00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,230\nit will have in here,\nthe server name to connect to.\n\n456\n00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,680\nAnd it is buried,\n\n457\n00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520\nI always mess this one up cuz it's\nburied under an interesting screen.\n\n458\n00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,240\nThe link for it is buried away\nunder the database dashboard.\n\n459\n00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,490\nIf I go back to my database, so\nif I go to like the sales DB, and\n\n460\n00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,580\nI go in here under the sales DB dashboard,\nit's in here that we can scroll down and\n\n461\n00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,490\nthere's the full server name to be able\nto connect to, that's what I need.\n\n462\n00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,550\nSo is that sbqc blah, blah,\nblah .database.windows.net.\n\n463\n00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,690\nThat's what I needed to be able\nto get connected to this server.\n\n464\n00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,270\nSo I'm going to copy that string so\nI'll have it, and then I'm gonna go and\n\n465\n00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,050\nget connected to the site.\n\n466\n00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,510\nAll right, so I've got the information.\n\n467\n00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,760\nNow I'll just jump over to my\nWindows machine right here.\n\n468\n00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,935\nAnd on the Windows machine, what I need\nis the SQL Server Management Studio.\n\n469\n00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,640\nAlright, if you've already got\nthe Management Studio you just fire\n\n470\n00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,190\nit up and you go.\n\n471\n00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,160\nIf you don't have it,\n\n472\n00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,070\nthe easiest way to get it is to\ndownload SQL Server 2014 express.\n\n473\n00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,220\nThe Express edition is free, and\nyou can download it when you install it,\n\n474\n00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,120\nyou can choose just to install\nthe management utilities, right?\n\n475\n00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,110\nYou don't have to actually\ninstall a database server.\n\n476\n00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,740\nYou can use all this on Windows Server or\nWindows 8, Windows 7.\n\n477\n00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,060\nIt'll install just fine, and\nyou can run the management utilities.\n\n478\n00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,500\nSo that's what I've done, and I've got\nmy management utilities right here.\n\n479\n00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,510\nAnd I'll just punch in that server name\nthat I just got from the other server.\n\n480\n00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,270\nI'll punch in my username that I set\nduring the install and my password.\n\n481\n00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,150\nNow if you just install\nthe management utilities,\n\n482\n00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,860\nthey default to Windows authentication.\n\n483\n00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,850\nWe need to do SQL authentication.\n\n484\n00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,110\nIt's not part of our active directory or\nanything so it is separate.\n\n485\n00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,590\nSo I need to provide those credentials and\nthen I can connect.\n\n486\n00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,660\nNow if my IP address is not on\nthe list I won't be able to connect.\n\n487\n00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,510\nI won't be able to get in there and\nsee that.\n\n488\n00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,400\nBut my IP address is in the list.\n\n489\n00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,860\nI'm gonna connect and\nnow it shows me on the server.\n\n490\n00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,110\nI can go under databases.\n\n491\n00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,825\nThere's my sales DB, there's my marketing\nDB, but on the same server, and\n\n492\n00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:47,565\nI see them both, I'm a sys admin,\nwhen I logged in, right?\n\n493\n00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:51,285\nI might create other user accounts and\ntie them to one database or the other.\n\n494\n00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,535\nBut my account's a sys admin,\nI can see the whole thing.\n\n495\n00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,325\nSo now I can jump into sales DB and\nI can look at the tables.\n\n496\n00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,160\nI can start to create some tables.\n\n497\n00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,180\nSo I'll create one and maybe this\nwill be sales staff or whatever,\n\n498\n00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,950\nand we can go through and specify the\ninformation to get those columns made and\n\n499\n00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,420\nget it in place and\nthen we're ready to rock, right?\n\n500\n00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,180\nAt this point,\n\n501\n00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,160\nwhen I work with it, it's no different\nthan a local SQL Server, right?\n\n502\n00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,080\nIt's hosted in Azure, but\n\n503\n00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,480\nI work with it the same as if it\nwas right here on my own system.\n\n504\n00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,630\nThat's the glory of the cloud, right?\n\n505\n00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,150\nWe don't have to work\ndifferently than we're used to.\n\n506\n00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,338\nWe just set it up a little different.\n\n507\n00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:31,040\n>> Than you don't need things like VPN, or\nwhatever if you're off on a business trip,\n\n508\n00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,160\nyou're at a hotel,\nyou're using their WiFi,\n\n509\n00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,850\nyou just log in to your Azure account and\nyou're off to the races.\n\n510\n00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,990\nYeah, a lot of times I'll use a VPN\nanyway just to be on the safe side, but\n\n511\n00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,460\nthis is encrypted.\n\n512\n00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,740\nIt does protect yourself there, so\nyou are covered in a lot of cases.\n\n513\n00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,700\nYep, but after that it just runs and we\ncan go and start to create more databases.\n\n514\n00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,960\nWe can monitor our performance\nback inside of our Azure screens.\n\n515\n00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,800\nDefinitely keep an eye on it as far\nas utilization and all of that.\n\n516\n00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,030\nDefinitely a part of running\nthis is just monitoring,\n\n517\n00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,440\nmaintaining, keeping it healthy.\n\n518\n00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,460\nBut all in all it's far easier than\nsetting up your own SQL server.\n\n519\n00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,820\nYou don't have to be\na DBA to figure it out.\n\n520\n00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,280\nMicrosoft supports the server back end.\n\n521\n00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,310\nYou just run SQL and do your job.\n\n522\n00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,920\n>> So when new SQL stuff comes\nout like updates for SQL Server,\n\n523\n00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,930\nthings like that\n>> Azure's taking care of that.\n\n524\n00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,360\nMicrosoft's handling all that business.\n\n525\n00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,430\nYou don't have to worry about nothing\nother than just get into your SQL and\n\n526\n00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,160\nhandle your database.\n\n527\n00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,780\n>> Absolutely, except for\nmajor upgrades, right?\n\n528\n00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,780\nSo this one just did, what did we do here?\n\n529\n00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,700\nIt was the version 12 database.\n\n530\n00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,580\nSo when the next version of SQL comes out,\nthey won't update that for\n\n531\n00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,630\nyou automatically.\n\n532\n00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,480\nInstead what you need to do is deploy\na new server that's with that new version.\n\n533\n00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,520\nAnd then you can export and\nimport your database.\n\n534\n00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,370\nAnd the idea is, you'd wanna do that\nanyway to test out your software,\n\n535\n00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,040\nmake sure the new version work fine and\nall that before you moved over.\n\n536\n00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,340\nMicrosoft SQL is not like other\nMicrosoft products, right?\n\n537\n00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,900\nWith Windows 7, when Windows 8 came out\nyou wanted to jump on it right away,\n\n538\n00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,470\ntake advantage of those new features.\n\n539\n00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,800\nWhen Windows 10 comes out,\nit'll be the same thing,\n\n540\n00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,430\nyou'll wanna jump to that right away.\n\n541\n00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,220\nBut SQL, boy that's your company data.\n\n542\n00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,380\nThat's your back end,\nthat's what running your business.\n\n543\n00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,250\nYou don't necessarily want\nto jump to that new version.\n\n544\n00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,960\nThat new version might not have any\nfeatures that you care about, and\n\n545\n00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,180\nMicrosoft still supports\nthe previous version, so\n\n546\n00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,830\nthere's not any great big push\nto move you to that next one.\n\n547\n00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,050\nMaybe there's some feature that you really\nwant you want, and you want to do it.\n\n548\n00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,440\nBut otherwise people typically wait and\nit's one of the last things they\n\n549\n00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,745\nupgrade even after desktops,\nbecause it's so sensitive.\n\n550\n00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:37,385\n>> Awesome.\nWell I guess we are now very schooled up\n\n551\n00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:41,055\nwhen it comes to getting a SQL\ndatabase installed using Azure.\n\n552\n00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,865\nI really like the fact that you\ndon't have to worry about that,\n\n553\n00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:46,635\nthe whole server area,\ncuz it is a real pain.\n\n554\n00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:50,175\nIt's time consuming, it's difficult to\nget everything configured correctly.\n\n555\n00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,760\nAnd I can just say, you know what, hey\nMicrosoft I'm going to give you a little\n\n556\n00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,510\nbit of this and you help me,\nhow about that?\n\n557\n00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,100\nAnd I'll just create databases,\nmakes that job a whole lot easier.\n\n558\n00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,930\n>> Absolutely.\n\n559\n00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,600\n>> So have we.\n\n560\n00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,710\nI think we've covered\nthe basics of this guy.\n\n561\n00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,210\nHopefully everybody out there is follow\nalong and learned a lot of good stuff.\n\n562\n00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,740\nThat being said,\nI guess it's time to end this show.\n\n563\n00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,510\nWe've come to another end\nto another great episode.\n\n564\n00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,310\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n565\n00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,590\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n566\n00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,750\nI've been your host Daniel

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,579\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:20,395\nHere with me today,\nthe master of the CLI, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,640\nHow are you doing today Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,442\n>> I'm doing great.\nSounds like a cult when you specify\n\n7\n00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:23,972\nit that way.\n\n8\n00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I'm excited about today's episode\n\n9\n00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,930\nbecause today we're going to be taking\na look at the command line interface for\n\n10\n00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,001\nMicrosoft Azure, which means if\nwe need to manage servers and\n\n11\n00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,366\nwe don't want to use the UI,\nthen we can just drop to a command line,\n\n12\n00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:39,586\nwe can type it out, and\nthen do all the great things that we need.\n\n13\n00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:40,707\nSo that's pretty exciting.\n>> That's heresy, Don.\n\n14\n00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,182\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, people are really used to that\n\n15\n00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:47,502\nGUI interface, it's hard to make that\njump to the CLI, but it can be very,\n\n16\n00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:48,846\nvery helpful for us, right?\n\n17\n00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,146\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n18\n00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:54,486\nWhat it comes down to is, sometimes\nthere's things that we want to configure\n\n19\n00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,647\nthat aren't available in\nthe user interface, right?\n\n20\n00:00:57,647 --> 00:01:01,368\nNow, Web UI for Azure,\nif you go to manage.MicrosoftAzure.com, or\n\n21\n00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,846\nWindowsAzure.com, you can jump\nright over there, see the GUI.\n\n22\n00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:08,487\nYou can create VMs, create databases,\ndo all that great stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:10,246\nBut there's some things you can't do.\n\n24\n00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:13,027\nFor example,\nyou can't do a static IP address.\n\n25\n00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:15,446\nYou want a static IP address\non a virtual machine?\n\n26\n00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:16,346\nGet to your command line.\n\n27\n00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,047\nCan't do it in the web UI, right?\n\n28\n00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,187\nThey're working on a new portal.\n\n29\n00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:23,143\nThey're always adding things to it, so you\nwill be able to do that in the future, but\n\n30\n00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:23,718\nnot today.\n\n31\n00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:26,478\nSo that's one reason why we\nmight need to use the CLI.\n\n32\n00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,618\nThe other reason, if we want to automate\nsomething, if we want to script something.\n\n33\n00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:34,217\nI have 20 activities I\nwant to occur in order.\n\n34\n00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:35,790\nI could do it by, hand that'd be fun.\n\n35\n00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,830\n>> Yeah, good times.\n\n36\n00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,907\n>> Or we could script it.\n\n37\n00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,008\nRun the script, it churns through all of\nthe commands, and it knocks it out, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,067\nMaybe I have something I want to\nhappen at 1:00 am this morning.\n\n39\n00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,588\nI don't want to be up at 1:00 am doing it,\nright?\n\n40\n00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:50,147\nI can write a script, have a schedule\nto run at 1:00 am, and we're done.\n\n41\n00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:53,537\nSo that kind of stuff is what we can\ndo from the command line interface, and\n\n42\n00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,969\nthat's why it's important.\n\n43\n00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:59,757\nNow, Microsoft's Azure service is\na little different than some of the other\n\n44\n00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:04,030\nguys that are out there like Rack Space\nand AWS and those guys in that,\n\n45\n00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,508\nthere's actually two different\nCLIs available to us.\n\n46\n00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,748\nYou might ask yourself,\nwhy do I need two command line interfaces?\n\n47\n00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,113\nWell the main reason is,\n\n48\n00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:16,087\nMicrosoft chose for their primary\ncommand line interface Power Shell.\n\n49\n00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:16,927\nMicrosoft Powershell.\n\n50\n00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,568\nIt's their shell environment.\n\n51\n00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:19,148\nThey love it.\n\n52\n00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,687\nThey do a lot of development in it.\n\n53\n00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:24,588\nThat's the primary command\nline interface for Azure.\n\n54\n00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:27,887\nBut what if you're running Linux or\nMac OS?\n\n55\n00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,528\nYou can't run the Power Shell, right?\n\n56\n00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:33,248\nAnd so in that scenario,\nyou can't use the Power Shell commandlet,\n\n57\n00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:35,248\nso instead you need a different CLI.\n\n58\n00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:39,527\nSo Microsoft created another CLI,\nit's just called the Azure CLI,\n\n59\n00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:43,749\nthat you can run on Windows or on Mac or\non Linux and it runs just fine.\n\n60\n00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,268\nSo you've got options, right?\n\n61\n00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,245\nThere's various ways that\nwe can go about this.\n\n62\n00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,593\nBut let's start with\nthat PowerShell one and\n\n63\n00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,945\nget a chance to see how it works\nthen we'll move into the others.\n\n64\n00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:56,043\nAll right now, the Power Shell,\nif you're running Windows 8 or\n\n65\n00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,745\nWindows Server 2012, right?\n\n66\n00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,945\nThose are the two main operating systems\nthat are out for Microsoft right now.\n\n67\n00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,593\nThey've got the Power Shell installed and\nactive by default, so\n\n68\n00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:05,145\nyou've already got the Power Shell.\n\n69\n00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,885\nIf you're running Windows 7, well,\nit's got Power Shell by default, too.\n\n70\n00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,900\nIf you're running Windows Vista or\nearlier,\n\n71\n00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,413\nyou might need to install it or at least\nactivate the feature, but most Microsoft\n\n72\n00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:17,686\noperating systems that are under\nsupport have the Power Shell available.\n\n73\n00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:18,926\nSo that's kind of step one.\n\n74\n00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:22,345\nYou've got to have the Power Shell\nif you can run the Power Shell CLI.\n\n75\n00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:26,205\nStep two is we need to install\nthe Azure command lists.\n\n76\n00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,245\nThe Azure commands are not\ninstalled by default.\n\n77\n00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,785\nLet me show you here on\nmy Windows 8 machine.\n\n78\n00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:35,255\nSo this is Windows 8, and\nif I fire up my Power Shell, so\n\n79\n00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:40,025\nI'll just launch that and\nI'm going to do a get-command.\n\n80\n00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,465\nI'll try and spell it right.\n\n81\n00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,605\nAnd I'm just gonna search for\nany command with the word Azure in it.\n\n82\n00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:47,225\nSo if I run that I get nada.\n\n83\n00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:50,425\nNot a single Azure command comes back for\nme here.\n\n84\n00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,426\nThere's nothing.\n\n85\n00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:54,003\nSo I need to add those\ncommandlets into the system, and\n\n86\n00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,745\nthen we'll be able to run with that.\n\n87\n00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,345\nSo that's kind of step two.\n\n88\n00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:01,776\nBut before I can do step two, there's\nsome prerequisites that I've got to meet,\n\n89\n00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,285\nall right?\n\n90\n00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,645\nThe Power Shell requires\n.NET Framework 4.5.\n\n91\n00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,405\nAnd so in Windows 8, that's installed\nby default, we've already got it.\n\n92\n00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:14,162\nBut the Azure Commandlets actually\nrequire .NET Framework 3.5, and\n\n93\n00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,625\n3.5's not installed by default.\n\n94\n00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,465\nNow I've already installed it on mine, but\njust to recap how to add that real quick.\n\n95\n00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:24,509\nIf you bring up your start menu and\nyou pull up the programs and features,\n\n96\n00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,759\nI'm just doing a quick search for\nprograms and features,\n\n97\n00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,073\nyou'll see all the different programs and\nfeatures that are installed, and\n\n98\n00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,889\nyou can go to this\nTurn Windows Features On or Off.\n\n99\n00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,627\nAnd if we go in there,\nright at the very top,\n\n100\n00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,668\nyou'll see .NET Framework 4.5 and 3.5.\n\n101\n00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:43,275\nIf you just did a fresh and\nclean install of Windows 8,\n\n102\n00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:46,748\nthe second one will already be checked,\nbut the first one will be empty.\n\n103\n00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,629\nYou you just ned to check that off and\nhit OK.\n\n104\n00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,009\nThat's gonna install\nthe .NET Framework 3.5.\n\n105\n00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,289\nWhen that's done,\n\n106\n00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:58,348\nnow we're ready to add the Azure services\nas your CLI to the system, all right?\n\n107\n00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,714\nAnd the easiest way to do that is,\non Microsoft's web site,\n\n108\n00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,568\nthey have a really neat utility.\n\n109\n00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:07,669\nIt's called the Microsoft Web\nPlatform Installer, all right?\n\n110\n00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,668\nAnd it lets you set up all sorts of web\nbased applications without having to\n\n111\n00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,048\nknow how they work.\n\n112\n00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,846\nIf you want to build up a WordPress\nserver, or Drupal, or Druma, or\n\n113\n00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:20,248\nsomething like that, you just run through\nthis little wizard, and it solves it.\n\n114\n00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:23,988\nWell, the Azure Power Shell\ncommandlets are a part of that.\n\n115\n00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:27,008\nAnd so we can add them right\nfrom this platform installer.\n\n116\n00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:30,515\nSo it's a free download, you download\nit from the site, you install it,\n\n117\n00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:32,788\nand I've also got that\none installed already.\n\n118\n00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:38,239\nSo I'm just going to run the Microsoft Web\nplatform installer, and when it runs,\n\n119\n00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:43,069\nit gives us a list of all the different\napplications that we can install.\n\n120\n00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,315\nNow, at the time of this taping,\n\n121\n00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:50,149\nMicrosoft Azure Power Shell is right\nhere under the spotlight, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,068\nThat means it's like, recommended.\n\n123\n00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,228\nIt's right down home screen.\n\n124\n00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,921\nBut by the time you watch this episode,\nthey might have phased that out for\n\n125\n00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,969\nsomething else, you know?\n\n126\n00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,688\nShare Point 2016 or something crazy,\nso you might see other things in here.\n\n127\n00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,349\nSo you might need to search for it up top.\n\n128\n00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,112\nAnd so you just type in Azure up there,\nand it will find it, and you'll see each\n\n129\n00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:09,608\nof the different things in here, and\nthere's all sorts of Azure stuff.\n\n130\n00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,685\nBut that Azure command line or\nthe Power Shell add-on,\n\n131\n00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:16,888\nit will be in here which, boy, there is\na lot of Azure stuff when you search.\n\n132\n00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:19,614\nSo we might want to search for\nAzure Power Shell, try and\n\n133\n00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,768\nnarrow that down a little bit,\nthere we go.\n\n134\n00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,088\nSo you can find it and we can add it.\n\n135\n00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:26,940\nAdding it is just a matter\nof hitting that button.\n\n136\n00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,934\n>> It's like looking for\na needle in a stack of needles.\n\n137\n00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,494\n[LAUGH]\n>> And once it's done,\n\n138\n00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:31,529\nit's not actually installed.\n\n139\n00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,529\nSee how it says one item to be installed?\n\n140\n00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,090\nI need to hit the install button first.\n\n141\n00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,338\nI've made that mistake before.\n\n142\n00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,215\n[LAUGH].\nSo all that stuff is going to install,\n\n143\n00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:40,708\ncouldn't be easier, right?\n\n144\n00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,088\n>> Yeah.\n\n145\n00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,729\n>> All right now, once it's done,\nand it'll take just a moment.\n\n146\n00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,808\nIt's got to download some utilities and\nstuff.\n\n147\n00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:51,628\nBut once it's done, I'll have a new\nmenu item for the Azure Power Shell.\n\n148\n00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,246\nIf I run my regular Power Shell,\nI still won't see the Azure command,\n\n149\n00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:57,699\nso it actually creates\na new Power Shell icon for\n\n150\n00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,988\nme that has the Azure\ncommand list enabled.\n\n151\n00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,848\nBut as soon as that's done,\nI'll be able to fire this up and\n\n152\n00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:04,348\nstart to work with it, right?\n\n153\n00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,755\nSo they've really tried to make this easy,\nand\n\n154\n00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,809\nI think they've done a pretty good job.\n\n155\n00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:13,153\n>> Yeah, I've noticed that Microsoft tries\nto make everything very intuitive, and\n\n156\n00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:17,684\nI've always said that they've done a good\njob, and that's why they're at the market\n\n157\n00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,848\nshare that they are because they\nmake it to where the person at\n\n158\n00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,633\nthe end of the terminal there can easily\nfigure out what the next step is or\n\n159\n00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,218\nwhere he should go from here.\n\n160\n00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:30,378\nAnd that's where I think other platforms\nhave not done as good of a job, let's say.\n\n161\n00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:33,838\n>> Yep, all right, well,\nit finished its installer.\n\n162\n00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:38,415\nAnd now if I jump right back into\nmy screen, I'm back to my regular\n\n163\n00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:44,259\nPower Shell, and if I run that same\nget-command *azure*, I still get nothing.\n\n164\n00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,558\nAnd that's because I'm in my\nregular Windows Power Shell.\n\n165\n00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:52,237\nSo if I get out of that, and I'll just\nbring up my start screen here and\n\n166\n00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,296\ntype in Azure.\n\n167\n00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:56,897\nThere's my new icon,\nMicrosoft Azure Power Shell.\n\n168\n00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:59,617\nIt's still the same Power Shell, the\nPower Shell I was running a moment ago.\n\n169\n00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,616\nBut with the Azure extensions on it.\n\n170\n00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,540\nAnd so when I run that,\nit's gonna open up.\n\n171\n00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,261\nIt looks basically the same, except\nright here I can tell that I'm in Azure.\n\n172\n00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,700\nAnd it gives me some little\nAzure help notes here.\n\n173\n00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,201\nRight?\n\n174\n00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:15,933\nI can run help azure, and\nI can start to get information here on\n\n175\n00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,520\nall the Azure commands that are available.\n\n176\n00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,120\nAnd there's one or two,\nthere's usually a couple of commands.\n\n177\n00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,446\nI think I'm on page 15 or 16-\n>> 9,000.\n\n178\n00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:27,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There's quite a few\n\n179\n00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,040\ncommands, right?\n\n180\n00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,801\nIf I do a get-command *azure*, which is\nwhat I was running before, we'll see.\n\n181\n00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:35,881\nThere's a few, right?\n\n182\n00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,670\nSo now I've got the Azure commands.\n\n183\n00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,340\nI'm ready to start working\nwith Azure View to CLI.\n\n184\n00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,120\nWell, there's one more thing I got to do.\n\n185\n00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,642\nIt needs to know about my account.\n\n186\n00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:47,252\nIt needs to know about my username and\npassword, so\n\n187\n00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:51,220\nit can get me into the system and\nstart to work on my instances and so on.\n\n188\n00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,330\nSo I need to go ahead and provide that.\n\n189\n00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,850\nAnd the way we do that is by typing\nin Add-AzureAccount Add-AzureAccount.\n\n190\n00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,386\nAnd when we do that, it's going to\npop up a little window here for\n\n191\n00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:10,040\nme to log in with my Live ID, right, the\nID tied to my Azure account that I use.\n\n192\n00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,260\nAnd so we can come in,\nand we can punch that in.\n\n193\n00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,980\nNow when I do this,\nit's actually gonna give me a complaint.\n\n194\n00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,220\nAnd it's gonna fail to log in, and there's\na few reasons for why that happens.\n\n195\n00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,940\nBut, or actually, you know what?\n\n196\n00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,140\nNo, I think this one will work.\n\n197\n00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,620\nLet's give it a try here,\nbefore I spurn it.\n\n198\n00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,660\nHere we go.\n\n199\n00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,470\nThere's actually two different types of\naccounts that we bump into with Azure.\n\n200\n00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,510\nThere's our our regular\nadministrator accounts, and\n\n201\n00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,910\nthen there's our organization accounts.\n\n202\n00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,997\nAnd when we log in, the other CLI,\nthe one that we use with Linux and Mac,\n\n203\n00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,551\nthat one requires an organization account.\n\n204\n00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,563\nThat's the one that's going to complain,\nbut\n\n205\n00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,780\nthis one just requires a regular\nauthentication and log in here.\n\n206\n00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,936\nSo I'm going to punch that in, and then\nwe get a chance to see this in action.\n\n207\n00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:56,100\nSo I'm just gonna punch\nin my password here, and\n\n208\n00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,460\nthen as soon as I authenticate,\nthat little window will disappear.\n\n209\n00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,551\nAnd you'll be dropped right back\nto this screen right here, and\n\n210\n00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,681\nwe'll see account added, Don@ITProTV.\n\n211\n00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,250\nIt's telling you about my subscription.\n\n212\n00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,590\nI'm on a Bizspark subscription.\n\n213\n00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,243\nYou might see that you're on a Enterprise,\nor whatever, subscription you've got.\n\n214\n00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,626\nMaybe you're MSDN, or something.\n\n215\n00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,835\nAnd then it'll just give you\nsome additional information.\n\n216\n00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:18,936\nBut now I'm in, and\nI'm ready to work with Azure.\n\n217\n00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,360\nI can start to issue all\nthose Azure commands and\n\n218\n00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,425\nstart to get some responses back.\n\n219\n00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,955\nSo, for example,\nif I want a list of my virtual machines,\n\n220\n00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:31,030\nI might say Get-AzureVM, and\nit's gonna look at my account.\n\n221\n00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,840\nAnd it's going to give me\noutput of what I can do.\n\n222\n00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,160\nNow, it can only do stuff that\nI have permissions to do.\n\n223\n00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,326\nSo my user account, Don@ITProTV,\nhas limited permissions to do things, and\n\n224\n00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,650\nI'm going to be held to those limits.\n\n225\n00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,720\nBut there I can see my virtual machines,\nitprotv-sp01, web01,\n\n226\n00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,380\nweb02, I can start to work with them.\n\n227\n00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,440\nNow I'm in the CLI, and I can start to\nreally do some some fun damage, right?\n\n228\n00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,255\n>> Now Don, I know that there was\na lot of commands that we saw, and\n\n229\n00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:00,511\nthat can probably be overwhelming,\nespecially if you're new at this.\n\n230\n00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,130\nI'm new at Azure, so\nit would seem overwhelming.\n\n231\n00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,690\nBut it does lead me to think\nthat it is very powerful.\n\n232\n00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,830\n>> It's extremely powerful.\n\n233\n00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,250\nWhen Microsoft creates\nnew features in Azure,\n\n234\n00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,710\nthey create it here in PowerShell first,\nand add it to the web UI second.\n\n235\n00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,870\nSo we have a lot more that we can do here\nthan what we could under the web UI.\n\n236\n00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,700\nSo that's why there are so\nmany commands in here.\n\n237\n00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,141\nAnd the TechNet website is really\na valuable resource for this.\n\n238\n00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,522\nBecause they have all the documentation\nfor all these commands,\n\n239\n00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:31,050\nwhere you can go to find some great help,\nconfiguration examples, and so on.\n\n240\n00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,587\nBut even using the help commands though,\nyou can find descriptions of the commands,\n\n241\n00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,551\nyou can get additional syntax help.\n\n242\n00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:41,493\nIf you do get-help followed by\nany of these other commands,\n\n243\n00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,291\nyou'll find all sorts of\ndifferent things that we can do.\n\n244\n00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:50,446\nSo, for example, if I do like Add-azure,\nand we kind of move through,\n\n245\n00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:55,280\nyou'll find a few different options\nin here like, where is the VM?\n\n246\n00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,380\nWell, it's just like Add-azureVM.\n\n247\n00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,720\nIf I wanted to create a new\nvirtual machine, if I can find it,\n\n248\n00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,690\nright there is VMImage.\n\n249\n00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,980\nSo if we want to create some VM image or\nwhatever, we can use this command.\n\n250\n00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,390\nIf we do a get-help followed\nby Add-azureVMImage,\n\n251\n00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,690\nnow it shows me the syntax and\ntells me a little bit about the command.\n\n252\n00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,540\nSo you can find more information on there.\n\n253\n00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,130\nYou can even add -examples to it, and\nit'll show you examples of that command\n\n254\n00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,310\nand how they could be used\nin different environments.\n\n255\n00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,550\nSo you can kind of stumble through and\nlearn it.\n\n256\n00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,740\nI don't recommend it.\n\n257\n00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,700\nUse the TechNet website.\n\n258\n00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,060\nThis is all fully documented there.\n\n259\n00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,720\nYou can find out really a ton of stuff.\n\n260\n00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,140\nAll right, so the PowerShell CLI,\nif you're in a Windows environment,\n\n261\n00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,210\nthat's what you want to use.\n\n262\n00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,240\nThat's the one that the Microsoft\nsupports first and foremost.\n\n263\n00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,250\nThat's the one you want to use.\n\n264\n00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,450\nBut if you're on a Linux box, if you're on\na Mac, or if you're on a Windows box but\n\n265\n00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,080\nyou just want to be\nconsistent with Linux and\n\n266\n00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,405\nMac, then there is another\nCLI that we can use.\n\n267\n00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,750\nThere's the Azure CLI that's\noutside of PowerShell.\n\n268\n00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,370\nIt's a lot more flexible, cuz it can run\non any system, and we can get it up and\n\n269\n00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,760\nget it going, all right?\n\n270\n00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,527\nNow the Azure CLI is based on node js.\n\n271\n00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,565\nSo it's a node application.\n\n272\n00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:13,887\nIf you're not familiar with that it's\nlike a JavaScript environment that\n\n273\n00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:19,049\nruns on top of a really, really mutilated\n[LAUGH] copy of a Google Chrome.\n\n274\n00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,696\nIt was developed by Google, but it allows\nyou to create these applications that run\n\n275\n00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,374\ndarn near anywhere and run very fast.\n\n276\n00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:27,151\nIt's not like Java, where you can run\nstuff everywhere, but you can run slowly.\n\n277\n00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:29,883\nWith Node, you can run stuff very,\nvery fast.\n\n278\n00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:33,402\nSo this CLI is actually\nbuilt on top of Node.\n\n279\n00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,233\nIf you want to install it in Windows,\n\n280\n00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,780\nthey have a nice little\ninstaller that you can use.\n\n281\n00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,620\nIt installs, and it's no big deal.\n\n282\n00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,690\nLet's see if I've got right here.\n\n283\n00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,440\nSo this is Microsoft's page install and\nconfigure the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux,\n\n284\n00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,730\nand Windows.\n\n285\n00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,760\nSo it's It's just called the Azure CLI\nversus what we saw a moment ago,\n\n286\n00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,750\nwhich was the Azure PowerShell Extensions,\nright?\n\n287\n00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,251\nThey both give you that\nfull functionality, but\n\n288\n00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,081\nthis one's its own dedicated CLI.\n\n289\n00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,590\nFor the Windows environment,\nthey make it easy.\n\n290\n00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,290\nYou have a little installer you download,\nand you're in business.\n\n291\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,810\nThat's the end of it, right?\n\n292\n00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,490\nBut if you're dealing with Linux or\n\n293\n00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,940\nMac or whatever, then you've actually got\nto go through and do a bit of an install.\n\n294\n00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,700\nSo let's see if they have\nthe install on this page.\n\n295\n00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,960\nDoesn't look like it, and\nthis is kind of showing off what it does.\n\n296\n00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,911\nBut if we jump over to the install page,\n\n297\n00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,700\nit'll show the different\nlinks that we have out there.\n\n298\n00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,365\nAnd what you'll find is that using\nan installer for Windows is the easiest.\n\n299\n00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,520\nYou click that link,\nit downloads and installs.\n\n300\n00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,921\nThey actually have installers for\nOS 10 and Linux also.\n\n301\n00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,720\nSo you have a few different options\nthere for getting it installed.\n\n302\n00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,150\nBut I'll tell you, it's a part of Node.\n\n303\n00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,180\nAnd Node has its own little\npackage manager, NPM.\n\n304\n00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,236\nSo if you happen to already\nhave Node.js on your system,\n\n305\n00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,091\nyou can just use NPN to install it.\n\n306\n00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:49,930\nIt's very fast,\nit gets on there really quick.\n\n307\n00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,770\nAnd now you've got the CLI.\n\n308\n00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,810\nLet me show you here on my mac.\n\n309\n00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,960\nSo I've got a Mac, and if I run Azure,\n\n310\n00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,640\nI don't have the Azure C.L.I.\non the right so I don't have that access.\n\n311\n00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,180\nBut I can quickly install\nNode on my system.\n\n312\n00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,620\nIn fact, I might even already have it.\n\n313\n00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,510\nLet me just run Node.\n\n314\n00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,530\nNo, I don't, okay.\n\n315\n00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,430\nSo I can quickly install\nNode.js in this system, and\n\n316\n00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,310\nthen I can use its package\nmanager to install.\n\n317\n00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,581\nSo I could use Microsoft's installer or\nI could use, oh yeah.\n\n318\n00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,175\nActually that's what\nthe showing right here.\n\n319\n00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:22,480\nNPM, that's the Node package manager for\ninstalling Azure CLI.\n\n320\n00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,260\nSo, if I go in here, and\n\n321\n00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,235\nI'll just real quick install Node,\nand so we'll get that on the system.\n\n322\n00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:33,320\nNode's not big, It's a fairly small\nproduct, it will install pretty quick.\n\n323\n00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,260\nThere we go.\nSo now, I've got it.\n\n324\n00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,710\nAnd you can always just\nrun Node to find out.\n\n325\n00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,790\nIf you get a prompt, right?\n\n326\n00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,930\nThat means that you're you're in it.\n\n327\n00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,060\nAnd then you can drop out of it,\nthere you go.\n\n328\n00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,110\nSo, I'm in Node.\n\n329\n00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,000\nI know I'm running it.\n\n330\n00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,650\nIt's happy it's there.\n\n331\n00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,760\nNow I can use NPM.\n\n332\n00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,611\nAnd I can install the Azure CLI.\n\n333\n00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,480\nSo I'll just say, install.\n\n334\n00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,600\nAnd I'm gonna do -g,\nwhich makes this global.\n\n335\n00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,868\nIt's gonna install it for\nall users, not just me.\n\n336\n00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:04,509\nAnd I'll say that I'm installing\nthe Azure CLI, all right?\n\n337\n00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:05,929\nSo it's gonna reach out.\n\n338\n00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,746\nAnd install that this would work on MAC,\nLinux, or\n\n339\n00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,850\nWindows long as you had node in place.\n\n340\n00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,750\nNow once it installs there we go.\n\n341\n00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,390\nOh, it's telling me I need to update my\nNPMs my version of node must be below\n\n342\n00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,670\nversion three so I probably need to\nupdate that but it'll work anyway.\n\n343\n00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,490\nSo there goes it installs it and now I\nshould have the Azure CLI On Windows,\n\n344\n00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,160\nit should start working immediately.\n\n345\n00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,690\nOn Linux or Macro S, the path\nvariable might not update right away.\n\n346\n00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,680\nSo if you run Azure and it doesn't work,\nthen that means you might need to update\n\n347\n00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,820\nyour path variable, which usually means\nyou exit that terminal window and\n\n348\n00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,450\ncome back in and then it will work.\n\n349\n00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,480\nIt's not like it's actually\nchanging anything but\n\n350\n00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,990\nif it does pick up the path right away,\nyou should see this, right?\n\n351\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,310\nThis is the little node\nserver that's coming up, and\n\n352\n00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,780\nit's running the Azure command.\n\n353\n00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,640\nYou get a nice little.\n\n354\n00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,185\n>> It's a cloud.\n\n355\n00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:58,060\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, ASCII graphic.\n\n356\n00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,560\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n357\n00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,100\nWe'll throw back to the olden days and\nthen you see some of the basic commands\n\n358\n00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,370\nthat we can do things about accounting,\nconfig, HD inside all those other guys\n\n359\n00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,710\nVM for configuring VMs and\nverbose and help right.\n\n360\n00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,050\nSo I now have the Azure CLI.\n\n361\n00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,220\nJust like the PowerShell though,\n\n362\n00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,270\nhere I need to set up my account\nI need to set my credentials.\n\n363\n00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,040\nOkay, and to set up your credentials.\n\n364\n00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,730\nWell it doesn't let you just put in the\nuser name and password but this is the one\n\n365\n00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,000\nthat complains when I started to\nsay that a moment ago I said whoop,\n\n366\n00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,090\nlet me back up on that.\n\n367\n00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,320\nIt's here, this guy If I try to\nprovide Don@itprotv.com password,\n\n368\n00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,210\nit's not going to except it all right?\n\n369\n00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,550\nIt needs this organizational account and\nso what we actually have to do is export\n\n370\n00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,070\nan authentication certificate\nfrom inside of Azure.\n\n371\n00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,230\nAnd then import it into the CLI to use,\nright?\n\n372\n00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,120\nNow the process is not hard, but\n\n373\n00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,230\nI'll tell you, basically we have to go\nto a URL to download the certificate.\n\n374\n00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,060\nAnd if you search on the Web it's wrong\nin almost all the documentation, which is\n\n375\n00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,430\nsuper frustrating, so I want to make sure\nI show you guys the right URL, so you can\n\n376\n00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,990\ngo and get the settings because this is\nsomething you'll run into in real life.\n\n377\n00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,340\nSo I'm just going to go back\nhere to my web browser.\n\n378\n00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,575\nAnd the URL that I need to\nbrowse to is https://manage\n\n379\n00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:21,478\n.WindowsAzure.com/publishsettings all\nright,\n\n380\n00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,180\npublish settings.\n\n381\n00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,120\nThat assuming you're already logged in if\nyou aren't logged in it'll make you log\n\n382\n00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,010\nin, but if you're logged in\nyou go to this web page and\n\n383\n00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,310\nit will give you a file to download.\n\n384\n00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,500\nAnd that file will contain\nyour certificate, right there.\n\n385\n00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,180\nSo, see?\nIt's going to download my credentials.\n\n386\n00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,510\nAnd it will contain a certificate to\nallow you to authenticate against\n\n387\n00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,190\nthe system, all right?\n\n388\n00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,450\nNow, I've already got mine downloaded.\n\n389\n00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,040\nIt's sitting there on my desktop.\n\n390\n00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,720\nSo I'll just use that.\n\n391\n00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,940\nBut once you've downloaded those\ncredentials all you have to do is drop\n\n392\n00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,160\nback to your command prompt, and\nwe just need to import those in.\n\n393\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,450\nAnd so,\nwhat we can do is we can do Azure, and\n\n394\n00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,570\nthen we need to basically tell it that\nwe're going to be adding this account.\n\n395\n00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,860\nSo Azure account.\n\n396\n00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,530\nSo for this to be useful I've\ngot to add that information so\n\n397\n00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,490\nI just need to import that settings\nfile into my system right?\n\n398\n00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,205\nAnd I save that right to my desktop so\nif I look here on my desktop I've got\n\n399\n00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:22,990\nthatITProTVdemo.publish settings right\nthat that's what the files always and\n\n400\n00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,980\nit is dot publish settings you can rename\nthe rest of it whatever you want but\n\n401\n00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,238\nI just need to import that in so\nI'll say Azure.\n\n402\n00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:31,558\nAccount, import.\n\n403\n00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,404\nAnd then I'm going to specify that file,\n\n404\n00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:40,287\nwhich is actually in my desktop.\n\n405\n00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,833\nAll right so I'm going to specify\nthat file and it's going to look at\n\n406\n00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,952\nit is going to get the certificate\nin the other information so\n\n407\n00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:54,955\nit's going to get everything that\nit needs to be able to work now.\n\n408\n00:19:54,955 --> 00:20:00,055\nOnce it imports that he knows my account\nit's got a certificate authenticate and\n\n409\n00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,225\nit should be able to bring it in and\n\n410\n00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:04,815\napparently account doesn't have an E on\nthe end of it so let me correct that.\n\n411\n00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,300\nNo accounting for bad spelling.\n\n412\n00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220\nSo we'll go ahead and bring that in.\n\n413\n00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,070\n>> Old English.\n\n414\n00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,060\n>> There we go and\nthat's what we expect to see.\n\n415\n00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,950\nNow I have seen where you\nget an error every now and\n\n416\n00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,610\nthen when you do the import and if that\nhappens it could be that it was set up\n\n417\n00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,820\nbefore there's some remnants\nof the settings or whatever or\n\n418\n00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,420\njust the account settings become\ncorrupt that does happen sometimes too.\n\n419\n00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,420\nSo a nice little command to kind\nof stick in the back of your mind,\n\n420\n00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:37,510\njust in case this happens to you, is you\ncan run azure account clear, like that.\n\n421\n00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,080\nAnd that'll wipe out\nthe account settings and\n\n422\n00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,950\nthen you can just re-import them in again.\n\n423\n00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,110\nSo if it ever gets messed up, it's not\nworking, azure account clear, it's a quick\n\n424\n00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,970\neasy way to get the account settings out\nof there and then re-import them in.\n\n425\n00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,320\nAll right, but in my case,\nit's got them and so\n\n426\n00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,330\nnow when I start to run azure commands,\nit knows who I am,\n\n427\n00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,430\nit knows my account, it knows to be able\nto reach out and touch those servers.\n\n428\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,132\nSo if I run something like, azure VM list,\n\n429\n00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:07,620\nit knows my account, it reaches out,\nit talks to the server and\n\n430\n00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,720\nit's getting a list of those virtual\nmachines right now and there they are.\n\n431\n00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,410\nITProTV, SP01, Web01, Web02,\nhere's their IP addresses.\n\n432\n00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,570\nIt's now connected, and\nthey'll work with the system.\n\n433\n00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,060\nNow the nice part about this command line\ninterface versus the power shell one\n\n434\n00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,970\nis it's consistent across Mac,\nLinux, and Windows.\n\n435\n00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,250\nSo if you're trying to write scripts\nthat can be run on any of those systems,\n\n436\n00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,600\nthis Azure CLI is better than using\nthe Power Shell command links.\n\n437\n00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280\nBut if you're in an all\nMicrosoft environment or\n\n438\n00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,450\nyou just love the Power Shell,\nbecause it is flexible and\n\n439\n00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,160\npowerful, Power Shell\ncommands are available too.\n\n440\n00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,640\nMicrosoft is also in tandem,\nso you can use them both.\n\n441\n00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,830\n>> Wow.\nThis is really cool stuff.\n\n442\n00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,990\nI like having the options.\n\n443\n00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,530\nI'm a big options fan,\nso being able to say\n\n444\n00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,820\nyou know what I'm on the Power Shell just\nstick with that and go and go that route.\n\n445\n00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,760\nOr maybe I'm working on\nLinux maybe I have Max.\n\n446\n00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,420\nMaybe I have the whole gamut of\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n447\n00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,270\nWell then I can be like Don said you\nknow consistent across the board I\n\n448\n00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,490\ndon't have to worry about trying to learn\nsomething new just learn that one and\n\n449\n00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,440\nit's a seems to be a little\nbit more powerful.\n\n450\n00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,450\nAnd that consistency is\nalways nice as well.\n\n451\n00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:12,960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n452\n00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,550\n>> Well I was going to say are we we\ncome to the end of the CLI will ease\n\n453\n00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,430\nthe basics of it how to use a get there.\n\n454\n00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,700\n>> Yeah there's obviously a ton ton more\nall the various commands that are in there\n\n455\n00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,060\nbut you know tech has a great resource for\nthat and you'll encounter them as you work\n\n456\n00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,150\nwith the services but just getting that\ncommand line installed in place and\n\n457\n00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,120\nconnected your account\nthat's basically it.\n\n458\n00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,630\n>> Awesome well I feel like my street\ncred is definitely going to be bumped up\n\n459\n00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,740\nthe next time I'm around the water\ncooler with my tech buddies so\n\n460\n00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,020\nI thank you very much Don I hope\nyou guys enjoyed it as well.\n\n461\n00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,470\nThis does come the end of our show though\nI hope you guys enjoyed everything that\n\n462\n00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,830\nwe've shown here is going to help you\nout with the Cloud and Azure stuff.\n\n463\n00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,970\nSo with that being said,\nit's time to sign off ITProTV.\n\n464\n00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,360\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n465\n00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,230\n>> And I'm Don Pizet.\n\n466\n00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,300\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n",
